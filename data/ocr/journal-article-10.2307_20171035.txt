<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER HOLQUIST CONDUCT MERCILESS MASS TERROR": DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON, 19191 "Rubashov shook his head. 'Your examples are all drawn from war ? that is, from abnormal circumstances.' 'Since the invention of the steam engine,' replied Ivanov, 'the world has permanently been in an abnormal state; the wars and revolutions are just visible expressions of this state.'" Arthur Koestler, Darkness at noon (New York: Time, 1962): 126. The Civil War has been portrayed as a "formative experience" for the Bolshevik regime, indeed for all Soviet society. As a formative event, it is then the Civil War, rather than the Bolsheviks themselves or their ideology, that becomes responsible for the regime's more extreme policies, both during the Civil War proper (e.g., war communism) and even well after it (e.g., dekulakization).2 This article argues, however, that the Soviet regime's 1919 policy of "decossackization" benefits from a comparison with the later 1929 policy of dekulakization at least as much as dekulakization benefits from comparison to some generic Civil War experience. For, in light of the Soviet state's 1929 drive "to eliminate kulaks as a class," decossackization appears to be less a Civil War policy than a reflection of a fundamental Bolshevik desire to foster an idealized image of the body politic by excising various malignant elements: Cossacks in 1919, kulaks in 1929. This article therefore presents decossackization, pursued in 1919 at the height of the Civil War, not as a war policy, but as a state policy that happened to be pursued during war. In other words, the years 1917-1921 were not merely the antechamber of Soviet power, its formative period; the policies of this period were Soviet power in practice, albeit in a war environment.3 So the Civil War policy of decossackization is an early demonstration of the Soviet regime's dedication to social engineering. It preceded dekulakization by over a decade and in some ways represented an even more radical attempt to eliminate undesirable social groups (dekulakization did not call for "extirpation" and "mass Cahiers du Monde russe, 38 (1-2), janvier-juin 1997, pp. 127-162.</page><page sequence="2">128 PETER HOLQUIST terror" in so many words). Yet Soviet policy always aimed at social engineering. It did not always employ the same methods to achieve it. What must be explained is why the regime pursued decossackization at this point in time and in this particular way. For operating upon society cannot be treated as a solely Soviet proclivity. While decossackization deserves comparison with the later Soviet policy of dekulakization, it merits equal comparison with the tsarist regime's policies of ethnic population management, practiced in the western territories of the Empire during the course of the First World War. For decossackization cannot be understood as a product solely of Soviet ideology or Russian political culture. It should instead be seen as a particular instance of the more generalized tendency, emerging throughout Europe in this period, for states to fashion purer, healthier societies (whether this was defined as a Volksgemeinschaft or a pristine socialist community). This article thus examines how the Soviet regime conceived, implemented and subsequently renounced decossackization as policy by considering its most extensive case of implementation, in the Don Territory. This region passed into Soviet control in early 1919 as a result of rebellion of a number of Cossack units in the anti-Soviet Don Army. The Red Army occupied much of the Don through mid-1919, permitting the Soviet regime to engage in various forms of social engineering of the body politic. Due in large part to these policies, a large-scale rebellion against Soviet power broke out in precisely those areas which had opened the front to the Red Army in January. Under pressure from both the Volunteer Army and the uprising in their rear, the Red Army was forced to retreat from the Don.4 Over this entire period, Soviet policy towards Cossacks underwent significant modifications, resulting finally in the "normalization" of Cossacks as a component part of Soviet society. For many years, the Soviet regime's policy of decossackization (raskazachivanie) was a "blank spot" in the historical literature. It first received extensive treatment in the late 1960's, when official Soviet publications opened discussion of the "errors" of this policy.5 Discussion of the topic in Soviet scholarship, however, was centered in the field of literature rather than history due to the influence of two works: Sholokhov's Tikhii Don and Trifonov's Otblesk kostra (1965).6 These works described decossackization as the brainchild of a small group in the Don Bureau, led by S.I. Syrtsov, and which was pressed at the national level by Trotskii and Sverdlov. While such works admitted that there had been atrocities, these were described as the excesses of individuals. This interpretation was an egregious case of special pleading. It sought to deflect all responsibility away from the Party and Soviet state, and often laid blame (implicitly while the USSR existed, but now often explicitly) at the feet of "the Jews."7 The semi-official dissident Roy Medvedev, in his chapter on decossackization in Philip Mironov and the Russian Civil War, avoids the anti-semitic excesses of these works. Yet he too seeks to absolve Lenin from knowledge of the decossackization circular, theorizing that Sverdlov was acting without Lenin's knowledge when it was formulated.8 Glasnost' allowed more measured treatments as well as publication in its entirety of the Orgbiuro's January 24 circular on decossackization.9 If many Soviet studies portrayed decossackization as an unfortunate anomaly, treatments in the West have held it up as a classic demonstration of the Bolsheviks' proclivity for terror, if not their outright genocidal tendencies.10 This approach now seems to be ascendant in Russia as well.11 Decossackization certainly was ruthless and does indeed demonstrate the regime's dedication to social engineering. But</page><page sequence="3">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 129 simply to ascribe the policy to Bolshevik ruthlessness alone does not explain much. It cannot account, for instance, for why it was pursued in the first half of 1919, but not before or after. Studies focusing on decossackization solely for the purpose of demonstrating Bolshevik criminality tend to treat all Soviet policy on the Don from January through September 1919 as of one piece. Yet the Orgbiuro's January 24 "mass terror" circular on decossackization was cancelled within a month and a half, on March 16. This period when the circular was in force (January 24-March 16) will be termed here "high decossackization." However, most of the atrocities Western scholars describe took place after the circular's cancellation, when anti-Cossack policies continued to be pursued, but in a different form.12 Thus merely citing the decossackization circular does little to describe what actually took place. If to explain decossackization one cannot merely point to the January 24 Orgbiuro circular and other "terror" documents, one must instead explain the general ethos in which the directive could arise and be carried out. The concept of decossackization was not invented by the Bolsheviks. It was discussed in the Imperial period. (True, it was applied to a spontaneous process rather than a conscious social policy, but the term existed nevertheless). Among the Soviet state's first acts was to abolish estate privileges. Even after 1919-style decossackization was abjured, the Bolsheviks never gave up their attempt to eliminate the Cossackry as a juridical-estate group. The regime was not even implacably opposed to the Cossacks as a cultural (as opposed to judicial or economic) group; in 1924 the Party even initiated a "turn to the Cossackry," allowing them some forms of cultural expression.13 Given both the earlier and later uses of decossackization to mean merely shearing the Cossacks of their judicial status and privileges, what we must explain for the 1919 policy of decossackization is why it took the particular form it did. I The preconditions: Cossacks as counterrevolutionaries The Red Army's advance in early 1919 brought much of the Don Territory under Soviet control, thereby presenting the Soviet regime with the possibility to practice decossackization. What decossackization meant, however, depended entirely upon how one defined the Cossackry. Prior to 1917 there had been talk in both the national and local press about eliminating the Cossack estate as a judicial entity and reducing Cossack privileges to those enjoyed by other citizens. This was a form of "decossackization" (the term used even then). Nor were all Cossacks opposed to such plans. Elimination of special privileges also meant the elimination of special burdens, such as Cossacks' universal, life-long military service and the need to meet ever rising equipping obligations.14 The essential precondition for the 1919 policy was that it was designed to eliminate not a judicial estate or economic class, but an ethnic population.15 Concomitantly, the meaning of decossackization ceased to be merely juridical reclassification and became instead eliminating a population itself ? either merely "as a class" or concretely as individuals. While the collective behavior of Cossacks certainly reinforced Soviet attitudes, Bolshevik policies were not simply a response to a counterrevolutionary Cossack</page><page sequence="4">130 PETER HOLQUIST monolith. During the Civil War, Cossacks participated disproportionately in the ranks of both sides. While more Cossacks served in the anti-Soviet Don Army (more because they were forcibly conscripted than out of any freely given social support), one-fifth of all Cossacks under arms ? a not insignificant number ? served with the Red Army.16 Indeed, it was a mutiny of Cossack regiments against the anti-Soviet Don command that opened the front and made possible the Red Army's advance into the Don in early 1919. Nor was the Cossack population of the Don uniformly hostile to the advancing Red Army. While some Soviet military reports indeed noted Cossack hostility to Soviet power, many others testified to their support for it. Reports on the mood of the population contain frequent mention of Cossacks welcoming Soviet power, and several reports note that in some Cossack communities the majority of men were serving with distinction in the Red Army.17 Well through April 1919, Soviet officials continued to pass along news that "there are thirty thousand Cossacks fighting like lions in the Red Army" and that "the [Red Army's] First Don Cossack division is composed primarily of Cossack volunteers."18 How then could decossackization happen? Several factors contributed to a view that Cossacks represented a counterrevolutionary monolith. First, while some Cossacks embraced Soviet power, many others opposed it. Cossacks after all comprised a significant percentage of those serving in armies opposed to the Soviet state, and while many had been forcibly conscripted, many others served quite willingly against the new revolutionary order. The indisputable fact that many Cossacks were bearing arms against the Revolution, willingly or not, played onto a set of mutually reinforcing stereotypes. The anti-Soviet military and political leadership held a romanticized and paternalistic image of Cossacks as Russia's paladins of order and statehood, loyal but in need of political tutelage. This image led the leaders of various anti-Soviet movements to seek out Cossack regions as their base of operations. In fact, it had been these officers and politicians, rather than Cossacks themselves, who had been largely responsible for the original overthrow of Soviet power on the Don in spring 1918. The self proclaimed Don Host leadership then sought to realize this idealized image of a Cossack Vend?e by forcibly conscripting Cossacks to serve and defend a cause portrayed to them as their own.19 The anti-Soviet movement's image of Cossacks as instinctive counterrevolutionaries both contributed to, and was itself reinforced by, Soviet views. Many in the revolutionary movement had long been conditioned to think of Cossacks as lackeys of the Imperial regime. A crude form of Marxist class analysis buttressed this view with references to Cossacks' alleged land wealth. Over the course of 1918, Soviet officials increasingly described their opponents generically as "Cossacks," rather than as "counterrevolutionaries" or "Krasnovites" as they had done at the beginning of the year. And, while Cossacks served in great numbers in the Red Army, they became increasingly invisible as Cossacks. In Soviet usage, "Cossacks" came to mean only those serving in the anti-Soviet Don Army, while Cossacks serving the Soviet cause became generic "Red Army men" (krasnoarmeitsy) .20 Even more significant than the fact that both sides saw and acted upon Cossacks as an undifferentiated whole was the ominous tendency of Red and White to reify</page><page sequence="5">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 131 juridical categories or economic attributes into entirely discrete "populations."21 The emergence of "population politics" was an essential precondition for decossackization. In Russia, this way of seeing and acting on populations had been foreshadowed in the Imperial period by military statistics, a required subject at the General Staff academy. Over the course of the second half of the nineteenth century, military statistics sought to convert the vast population of the Empire into a hierarchy of discrete segments ("elements") according to their purported political reliability and utility to the Russian state. For Imperial military statistics, these different elements were distinguished primarily by religion and ethnicity.22 Such assessments were far from merely academic issues. The Russian Army's forced deportation of Jews from the western provinces during the First World War merely transcribed into practice what military statistics had been saying for years about the Jews of those areas.23 That is, the 1914-1915 forced deportation of Jews was not merely the product of traditional anti-semitism but resulted from the intersection of such views with new ways of thinking of and acting on the population. Thus social engineering of those segments of the population deemed "unreliable" or "malignant," whether the criteria for that be nationality or class, had fully emerged at the turn of the twentieth century and was hardly limited to the Bolsheviks. Nor should such measures be considered purely war-time expediencies. Wartime only witnessed a more extensive implementation of existing desires to manage society.24 Military statistics were extensively implemented only during the First World War, but they had been conceived and taught for the previous half-century. Likewise, Soviet sculpting of a purer image of society was pursued during the Civil War. But it was also pursued well after it was over, most forcefully in 1929-1931. The presumed irreducibility of political identities ascribed to ethnic or class criteria is reflected in the increasing use of the term "element" to describe organically distinct collectivities comprising the general population. The employment of this term too was an elaboration on a concept earlier employed by Imperial military statistics, a term which had described the objects of policy during the forced deportations of the First World War.25 Use of the term "element" is of far more than linguistic interest. Decossackization was predicated in part on assumptions inherent in the term itself. The Soviet colonization program for the Don Territory, drawn up in mid-1919, was expressly intended to "dilute" the Cossack "element" by introducing "peasant elements from Central Russia."26 Likewise, the administrative partition of the Don Territory had less to do with geographic reorganization than with population management. For much of 1919, the Soviet state planned to append portions of Tsaritsyn province and the Donets Basin, along with their populations, to the Don Territory. The explicit goal was "to dilute" the Don's Cossack presence through the introduction of a more reliable worker "element."27 By 1919, seeing and acting upon "elements" in the population had become endemic. Both Red and White envisioned the Don Territory as inhabited by two distinct populations: the peasant khokhly (a derogatory term for Ukrainians) and the ethnically Russian Cossacks.28 Thus the category of "Cossack" was no longer merely one of many administrative aggregations imposed upon a group of people, but instead described a "population" or "element" that was irreducibly "Cossack" (and whatever attributes were assumed inherent in that term). "Cossack-ness" came to reside in Cossacks themselves, rather than in a bureaucratic category ascribed to that group.</page><page sequence="6">132 PETER HOLQUIST Some formulations went so far as to depict Cossacks as an entirely different species. As Soviet forces advanced into the Don, the commander-in-chief of all Soviet forces described the foe in a journal article: "one soon notes a great similarity between the psychology of the Cossackry and the psychology of certain representatives of the zoological world."29 Indeed, a critic of decossackization's excesses singled out this "zoological" analysis as responsible for the specific form high decossackization took. During a review of the failed policy in July 1919, Frenkel' (who while on the Don Bureau had vainly fought Syrtsov's excesses in decossackization) wrote the Central Committee that "the estate struggle (soslovnuiu bor'bu) between the Cossackry and the peasantry (outlanders) should, in my view, be conducted within the parameters of class struggle (v ramkakh klassovoi bor'by), and not degenerate into an amorphous zoological struggle."30 Frenkel' has succinctly identified the specificity of 1919-style decossackization, for this quasi-biological understanding of "Cossack" required methods for decossackization different from those directed against a juridical Cossackry. If "Cossacks" merely described those of a certain estate or class category, good Marxists knew that new conditions could transform even counterrevolutionary Cossacks into model citizens ("being determines consciousness," claimed Marx). But once Cossack came to mean an ethnic, at times quasi-biological "element," Cossackness in all its counterrevolutionary persistency could then no longer be eradicated by merely changing conditions around Cossacks. Physical extermination then necessarily replaced the elimination of a juridical entity as the only solution to the Cossack element's counterrevolutionary nature.31 Counterrevolution was no longer revealed through any concrete counterrevolutionary act; counterrevolutionary was simply what Cossacks were.32 One final factor: there was a great deal of estate and class antagonism on the Don, and we should not imagine that large-scale social violence was solely the invention of the Bolshevik Orgbiuro. Cossacks had long lorded their juridical (if not always economic) superiority over non-Cossacks, and this bitter hostility quickly took political form during the Revolution and Civil War. Non-Cossacks could now appeal to the Soviet republic and portray long-standing Cossack antipathy and violence towards them as "counterrevolutionary." One local Soviet activist warned his superiors in late summer that even those Cossacks "ostensibly dedicated to Soviet power" were in fact counterrevolutionaries. "In a word," he claimed, "the Cossack element is unreliable" [emphasis in original; note also the use of "element"].33 That is, regardless of their affirmations and even acts in support of Soviet power, Cossacks were not to be trusted. Non-Cossacks serving in the Red Army even rebuffed Cossacks seeking to volunteer, forcing them to return to their stanitsy, there with little choice but to join the anti-Soviet insurgency.34 Peasants had long wished to settle accounts with Cossacks. But now peasants could appeal against them as counterrevolutionaries to the new revolutionary regime. And the socialist state proved consistently willing to embark on decossackization ? although this term came to have many meanings. And, as 1918 progressed, it increasingly came to mean "eliminating Cossacks outright." In June 1918 peasants spoke of merely "cutting the trouser stripes off Cossacks," that is, abolishing all features distinguishing Cossacks from the rest of the population.35 By late September 1918, however, some had moved on to making the argument for physical extermination. Soviet officials reported that, in response to Cossack calls for the total</page><page sequence="7">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 133 extirpation (istreblenie) of non-natives living on the Don, peasants in turn had come to call for the "extirpation of Cossacks in tot?" (employing a blood-chilling phrase much in use at the time: pogolovnoe istreblenie or istrebit' pogolovno).36 By December, Trotskii was warning that "more and more often we hear the voices of the workers and peasants ? 4we must extirpate all Cossacks, then peace and calm will come to South Russia!'"37 So by the time decossackization was officially declared in late January 1919 it was a truism among Soviet supporters, both at the local and national level, that "the Cossack population" was counterrevolutionary and ripe for some form of decossackization. Antipathy towards Cossacks, however, was nothing new. It was only when central organs sanctioned and channeled this antipathy into policy that directed, mass violence became possible. Views of Cossacks as inveterate counterrevolutionaries were an essential precondition for decossackization. What made decossackization possible as policy, however, was that the Soviet state institutionally endorsed and then acted upon such views.38 Here it must be said that, while subordinate organs certainly had little compunction about using terror, it was the Center that established the parameters within which official violence could be practiced. Even where the Center was unaware of the actions of local officials (and, as we will see, it usually was aware of their actions), it had created the environment for such "excesses," both through its official sanction of violence and by establishing a command system responsible only for carrying out orders from above. II High decossackization as terror The significance of policies formed by central organs in Moscow can be measured by contrasting Soviet policy on the Don before and after the Orgbiuro circular. Until late January 1919, the Southern Front, assisted by the Don Bureau, implemented Soviet policy on the Don.39 As the Red Army advanced into the Territory, the Southern Front had issued its own January 22 "Instruction to political commissars on the organization of authority in territories liberated from the Krasnovite yoke," a directive which proved much more discriminating in its application of terror than the Central Committee circular was to be.40 The "Instruction" directed Soviet officials that "mass terror in the occupied territories is entirely undesirable and intolerable, playing into the hands of Krasnovite fear-mongering and complicating our position. Terror is to be employed against only the leading actors of the White guard camp, [while] the suspicious and unreliable elements are to be subject to arrest and dispatch to Borisoglebsk or Balashov." The Southern Front thus limited terror only to those who had demonstrated their counterrevolutionary nature through the commission of actual counterrevolutionary acts. This distinction was further elaborated in the Southern Front's "Instructions to khutor and village commissars."41 While requiring the arrest of all those who "took an active part in the struggle against Soviet power" (notably officers, priests and atamans), the instruction directed that those conscripted by Krasnov and who had</page><page sequence="8">134 PETER HOLQUIST returned to their homes were to be treated like all other citizens, as long as they were not guilty of any atrocities while in Krasnov's army. These directives, however, were soon superseded by the Orgbiuro's less discriminating circular. The distinguishing feature of high decossackization was the policy of indiscriminate terror against all Cossacks, as Cossacks, a policy resulting directly from a January 24 circular from the Party's Orgbiuro. As the Red Army advanced into Cossack regions, S.I. Syrtsov had suggested to his Party superiors that they formulate a policy towards Cossack regions now coming under Soviet control. Despite his youth and relatively late arrival on the Don (having escaped from Siberian exile, Syrtsov had been dispatched to Rostov-na-Donu by the Bolshevik Party in mid-1917 at the ripe age of 24), he nevertheless claimed a specialized knowledge of Don affairs. Serving as chairman of the recently constituted Don Party Bureau, he consistently pressed for the most radical form of decossackization. And for much of 1919 the Central Committee endorsed his views over strong opposition from other members of the Don Bureau (notably Frenkel') as well as from the Southern Front's Revolutionary Committee (most prominently Sokol'nikov).42 By early 1919, however, the members of the Central Committee did not need Syrtsov to convince them that the Cossackry was irreparably counterrevolutionary. Ironically, the purpose for issuing the circular was the Red Army's rapid advance into Cossack regions, an advance the Central Committee knew fully well was the result of Cossack units opening the front to the Red Army. The Orgbiuro, rather than the entire Central Committee, formulated the January 24 circular. It reads:43 "Recent events on various fronts in the Cossack regions ? our advance to the heart of Cossack settlements and demoralization among the Cossack forces ? compel us to give Party officials directions on the nature of their work in establishing and consolidating Soviet power in the specified regions. Considering the experience of a year of civil war against the Cossackry, we must recognize the only proper means to be a merciless struggle against the entire Cossack elite by means of their total extirpation (putem pogolovnogo ikh istrebleniia). No compromises, no half-way measures are permissible. Therefore it is necessary: 1) To conduct mass terror [emphasis in original] against wealthy Cossacks, extirpating them totally; to conduct merciless mass terror against all those Cossacks who participated, directly or indirectly, in the struggle against Soviet power. To the middle Cossackry it is necessary to take all steps that guarantee no further attempts on its part to rise against Soviet power. 2) To confiscate grain and compel storage of all surpluses at designated points, both in terms of grain and all other agricultural goods. 3) To take all measures for helping the poor who are arriving to settle [and] organizing resettlement where possible. 4) To level the non-local outlanders with the Cossacks in land and all other concerns. 5) To conduct total disarmament, executing anyone who is found with weapons after the date of their [the weapons] surrender. 6) To issue weapons only to reliable elements [sic] from among the outlanders. 7) To leave armed detachments in Cossack stanitsy until the establishment of total order. 8) All commissars appointed to this or that Cossack settlement are urged to demonstrate maximum firmness and implement the present instructions without deviation. The CC orders the instruction to the People's Commissariat of Land be conducted through all relevant Soviet institutions to work out, in short order, practical measures for the massive resettlement of the poor to Cossack lands. The Central Committee RCP."</page><page sequence="9">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 135 The circular differed significantly from the Southern Front's "Instruction." First, it envisioned the area coming under the control of the Red Army as "Cossack regions" rather than "territories liberated from the Krasnovite yoke." It portrayed the struggle as one against the entire Cossackry rather than the activist core of the Krasnovite army. Secondly, it ordered a policy of mass terror, a policy which only two days before the Southern Front had considered "undesirable and intolerable." Thirdly, since the entire Cossack elite was presumed to be irreparably counterrevolutionary, it was to be subject to "total extirpation." Instead of trying to win over the middle Cossackry, as the regime was trying to do with the middle peasants, the Orgbiuro commanded that the middle Cossackry be restrained from acting on its presumed counterrevolutionary nature ? restrained through use of preventative terror. Finally, the circular significantly expanded the focus of mass terror. The elite was subject to outright "total extirpation." But while the Southern Front's "Instruction" had spared those who had been forcibly conscripted, the Orgbiuro circular called for "merciless, mass terror" against those who took a "direct or indirect" part in the struggle against Soviet power. Considering the Don Army's compulsory universal mobilizations, at times covering all males between the ages of 18 to 50, the entire male Cossack population which had remained on the Don could be said to have "indirectly participated" in counterrevolution ? and hence was to be subject to merciless terror. Even if the circular was scrupulously observed, the number of the "Cossack elite" slated for extirpation was by no means small. For instance, the commissar of Berezovskaia stanitsa divided the entire Cossack community into one of three categories: 5,605 individuals were classified as "poor," 4,770 as the "middle" category, and 3,125 as "money-bags" (bogatei)44. According to the Orgbiuro circular, fully 23% of this community's population (the 312 "wealthy" families) was to be "extirpated." Prior to receiving the circular, the Southern Front had initiated its own policies (the two "instructions"). Then, circa February 4, the Southern Front's Revolutionary Military Council (RMC ? as much a political as a military organ) received the Orgbiuro's circular, which it dutifully distributed down the chain of command. The Southern Front RMC seems to have tried to frame the new directive in more moderate form. In dispatching the Orgbiuro's circular to its forces, it included an accompanying cover letter, charging officials to operate with the "requisite tact and caution" in the interests of furthering differentiation among the Cossackry.45 Recall that the circular itself had rather insistently emphasized not caution, but maximum firmness and no deviations. However, while it might introduce various interpolations, the Southern Front nevertheless had to carry out the essential points of the Orgbiuro's directive. On February 5, only one day after it first received the circular, the Southern Front's RMC issued Order #171 on the formation of revolutionary tribunals, followed the next day by Order #178 on district revolutionary committees. These two decrees were the essential tools for implementing high decossackization. Then, on February 7, the Southern Front RMC issued its own instructions on how the Orgbiuro's circular was to be applied. During a later policy review of decossackization's failure, some Party officials sought to blame the RMC's instructions, rather than the Orgbiuro's circular, for any and all excesses. Yet the instructions actually added nothing substantial to the</page><page sequence="10">136 PETER HOLQUIST Orgbiuro's circular.46 They mostly contained guidelines for administering the population. But point four did concern terror: "the main duty of stanitsa and khutor executive committees is to neutralize (obezvredit') the Cossackry through the merciless extirpation of its elite. District and stanitsa atamans are subject to unconditional elimination, [but] khutor atamans should be subject to execution only in those cases where it can be proved that they actively supported Krasnov's policies (having organized pacification, conducted mobilization, refused to offer refuge to revolutionary Cossacks or to Red Army men)." The use of the term "extirpation," absent in all earlier Southern Front policy directives, is clearly a direct transposition from the Orgbiuro circular. It is also clear that the Southern Front still had not been won over entirely to the Orgbiuro's view that the Cossackry as a whole was an irrevocably counterrevolutionary "element," with the corollary that physical extermination was the only remedy. Contrary to the later accusations that it was the Southern Front's instructions that were overbroad, rather than the Orgbiuro decree itself, the Southern Front still limited the application of terror only to those who had actively opposed Soviet power (khutor atamans are to be subject to terror only if "they actively supported Krasnov's policies"). "Terror" was not some unstructured, indiscriminate slaughter, nor was it a terrible retribution by peasants for past Cossack abuses. Terror was policy, organized, sanctioned and conducted by officially-established legal organs. Acting on the Orgbiuro circular and operating in close contact with the Central Committee, the Southern Front quickly established an entire network of tribunals to carry out the prescribed mass terror. Regimental tribunals, composed of the occupying unit's commissar and two other Party members, were to be established in every stanitsa occupied by Soviet forces.47 These tribunals were to operate along a unit's path of advance and at all points where it happened to quarter. Their sentences were not subject to review. And these orders were swiftly carried out. Within two weeks, the Southern Front was receiving reports that the tribunals were "overloaded with work."48 Despite subsequent claims to the contrary, the Center was fully aware of the tribunals' activities. Through the Army chain of command, central state and party authorities diligently supervised local tribunals' activities and regularly pressed them to be even more energetic. In Khoper and the Upper Don districts, military superiors dissatisfied with the pace and severity of "regular" divisional revolutionary tribunals ? which were showing no compunction about executing people ? appointed in their place "extraordinary revolutionary tribunals" to review sentences already handed out and to handle all new cases.49 Such "extraordinary tribunals" proved indeed to be significantly "firmer." The "regular" Khoper revolutionary tribunal had handed down two death sentences among the 31 individuals brought before it. Its successor, the "extraordinary" tribunal, reviewed the sentences already handed out and upgraded 10 more people to the death sentence. Over the next two weeks the "extraordinary tribunal" tried 142 defendants, sentencing 93 to death (90 for the rather elastic category of "counterrevolution") and acquitting a mere 17. Over a one-month period in March 1919, the Khoper extraordinary revolutionary tribunal handed down a total of 226 death sentences. Nor was Khoper district an exception. In Morozovskaia and Ust'</page><page sequence="11">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 137 Medveditsa districts as well, Army RMCs pressed local officials to be more "energetic," inquiring in one case if the appointed local officials were aware of how best to put hostages to good use.50 Significantly, pressure for more "energetic" prosecution came not from the military per se (recall that it was often divisional revolutionary tribunals that proved "lax") but emanated directly from the VIII, IX and X Armies' Military Revolutionary Committees ? organs appointed by, reporting to and responsible before officials in Moscow. What did decossackization mean in practice? Let us take the case of the Upper Don district and its capital, Veshenskaia stanitsa.51 It was Cossacks of this district who had opened the front to the Red Army. The insurgents, however, had not embraced Soviet power fully. They believed they had come to a cease-fire agreement with individual Soviet units, whereby the Cossack units returned to their stanitsy in exchange for a promise from Soviet regiments not to enter the Don Territory. Upon returning to their stanitsy the regiments remained intact, deposing the authorities appointed by the Don regime and replacing them with elected (as opposed to appointed) atamans. But the Soviet command did not recognize the cease-fire signed by individual units without authorization. As the Southern Front gradually learned of the developments among the Cossack units, it cautiously moved forward to contact the new authorities. On January 22 the new authorities in Veshenskaia replaced the ataman they had just elected with a regimental committee, hoping it would prove more palatable to the advancing Soviet authorities. That same day the regiment issued its own "Order #1," abolishing the wearing of epaulets and calling for the arrest of any fleeing officers or bourgeois.52 The Kazanskaia stanitsa regiment responded in a similar way.53 All these measures to secure recognition from the Red Army were in vain. Delegates from the 33rd Moscow workers' regiment arrived in Veshenskaia on January 28 and quashed all hopes of the Veshenskaia authorities that the Red Army would observe the terms agreed to by individual regiments. Two days later elements of the 15th Inzenskaia division (one of the Red Army's most reliable units, having already served with distinction on the Eastern Front), arrived in the stanitsa. On February 9 the division's headquarters entered the stanitsa. The 28th Cossack regiment, which had opened the front to Soviet forces and had for a time functioned as the stanitsa's authority, was drawn up on the square. The Soviet command thanked them for their service, declared that there would be no mobilization, but that volunteers to serve in regular Red Army units would be welcomed, and then dismissed them. The 12th division occupied Kazanskaia, prompting the members of the Kazanskaia regiment, which had thought it had secured both a cease-fire and a promise from Soviet forces that they would not cross the Don's border, to disperse to their homes. The Red Army occupied communities but had not demonstrated any plans for radical social engineering. Within several days, however, Soviet forces received the Orgbiuro's January 24 circular (recall that it was distributed to units of the Southern Front ca. February 4). Events followed swiftly. Meeting in Voronezh, the Don Bureau appointed an Upper-Don district revolutionary committee the very day the Inzenskaia divisional headquarters entered the district capital (February 9). In addition, as district military commissar it replaced the Veshenskaia regiment's elected commander with the former head of a Mogilev Cheka battalion.</page><page sequence="12">138 PETER HOLQUIST The Center had also called for "mass terror." In Veshenskaia, however, the continuing advance of the Inzenskaia division prevented the immediate formation of a revolutionary tribunal. Only in early March did a divisional tribunal arrive to initiate "mass terror." However, as in other areas, military superiors found the activity of the divisional tribunal insufficiently "firm," and dispatched an "extraordinary tribunal" to carry out the directives with greater zeal.54 Within weeks, the Cossacks of this region, who had rebelled against the anti-Soviet Don Army, would engage in a massive, protracted and quite bloody anti-Soviet uprising (the so-called Veshenskaia or Upper-Don uprising), an uprising that led in the summer of 1919 to the collapse of the Southern Front and Soviet power on the Don.55 Having examined all available materials, Venkov has concluded that the number of executions throughout the region probably numbered around 300, comprising roughly two executions per thousand of the population (although the number would likely have grown had the region not overthrown Soviet power when it did).56 So the Soviets clearly executed hundreds of "Cossack counterrevolutionaries" in this region. It is difficult to be more precise, for both the insurgents and later the Whites sought to employ the executions for agitational purposes. Venkov gives the example of one insurgent official who reported 500 executions in Veshenskaia and another 140 in Bokovskaia, but who later related that only 8 people had been sentenced to death in Bokovskaia ? and Soviet authorities had not even managed to carry these sentences out before their retreat.57 Lists of individual victims compiled by the insurgents immediately after the uprising provide much more modest figures (12 in Veshenskaia, 24 in Migulinskaia) than those reported in later agitational broadsheets.58 As far as I am aware, there exist no credible figures for the total number of decossackization victims. They clearly numbered in the thousands, perhaps even exceeding 10,000. In some regions hundreds were executed. As we have seen, the Khoper district extraordinary tribunal was very active, with a one-month total of 226 executions. The Kotel'nikovo regional tribunal was similarly busy. By early May it had presided over 1,200 arrests and 117 executions, and White intelligence reports later charged that the total executions reached 1,000.59 The Tsymlianskaia tribunal, again according to White intelligence, oversaw the execution of more than 700 people throughout the entire stanitsa, with 200 from the stanitsa proper.60 Yet not all regions suffered equally, and it would be an exaggeration to claim that decossackization constituted an accomplished "Cossack genocide."61 Not all tribunals were as "firm and energetic" as those of Khoper and Kotel'nikovo. The Millerovo revolutionary tribunal met for the first time on March 2 and by the end of the month had handed down just 8 death sentences, while the Berezovskaia stanitsa revolutionary tribunal made a total of 20 arrests in a community of 13,500 people.62 Even White press accounts number the executions in Mitiakinskaia and Semikarakovskaia stanitsy in the dozens rather than the hundreds (18 and 21, respectively) and report no executions in Velikokniazheskaia.63 In the stanitsa and khutory of Skurishevskaia, the stanitsa tribunal arrested 102 people. Of these, 12 were executed, 21 were held and later removed during the Soviet retreat, several died in prison ? and 58 were released.64 I wish to emphasize that in analyzing these figures I am obviously not seeking to downplay or dismiss very real executions by the Soviets. I wish to make the point that White reports of Red atrocities were</page><page sequence="13">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 139 themselves intended for agitational purposes, and any analysis of such atrocities much recognize this (Venkov provides an excellent example in this regard). Ill High decossackization as non-recognition of the Don While terror was the most conspicuous point of the Orgbiuro circular, high decossackization encompassed an entire complex of other measures to "neutralize" the Cossackry. As the Orgbiuro circular directed, local officials assiduously disarmed the Cossack population. In collaboration with the Cheka, "extraordinary detachments" conducted house-to-house searches for weapons, and some officials went so far as to confiscate all state-issued military supplies down to articles of clothing.65 A series of other orders made Cossacks the specific target of confiscations. Southern Front Order #248 (February 18) directed that carriages and hay be requisitioned from Cossacks. This was followed several weeks later by Order #369 (March 10), confiscating all saddles from Cossacks.66 What is remarkable about both orders is not the requisitions themselves (common enough in the Russian Civil War), but that they singled out the Cossack population as the specific target of these requisitions. Decossackization, however, did not concern only Cossacks. In the minds of Soviet policy makers, views of the Don could not be uncoupled from attitudes towards the Cossacks. Over the course of 1918, Soviet officials had increasingly described their counterrevolutionary foe as the entire Don ? at times anthropomorphizing the Don Territory itself into the arch-foe of the Soviet Republic. The changing title of a series of articles devoted to the struggle in the South captures the growing distrust to the Don Territory in toto.61 The article was written by Vatsetis, commander of the Republic's armed forces, and first appeared under the title "The struggle against Krasnov," in Izvestiia VTsIK on January 28,31 and February 1,1919. Several days later the same article appeared in Izvestiia narodnogo komissariata po voennym i morskim delam ? but with a new title: "The struggle against the Don." It was explicit in its anthropomorphic representation of the Don as the foe: "our titanic struggle against the Don. [...] The Don came forth against us, against the Russian revolutionary laboring people, and in its previous historical role as a bandit and strangler of all aspirations for freedom in Russia" (February 2). As a result of such views, the Soviet leadership refused to grant the Don any form of administrative recognition analogous to that of other provinces and regions; indeed, it soon sought to erase the Don Territory from the map altogether. So loath was the Center to grant the Don any form of recognition that it opposed even direct administration by the Don Party Bureau. The Don Bureau, which had pressed so insistently for decossackization, found its pleas for a role in administering the territory repeatedly rejected by the Central Committee. Over a period of two weeks, the Don Bureau submitted three direct requests to the Central Committee (January 15, 27 and 28) for some form of territorial organ. The Southern Front supported this request, although it demanded the Army retain</page><page sequence="14">140 PETER HOLQUIST control over any administrative organ.68 Neither the Southern Front nor the Don Bureau yet knew of the Orgbiuro's January 24 circular on decossackization, received by the Southern Front only ca. February 4. Hence they obviously were not expecting the Central Committee's response to their petitions, which came on January 29. In a terse telegram, the Center insisted that control over all activity was to be concentrated in the hands of the Southern Front's RMC, with the added injunction that "there is to be no Don executive committee and no Don government."69 This curt but clear response did not deter the Don Bureau. Syrtsov consulted with the Southern Front's RMC, and on February 4 Khodorovskii on its behalf contacted Sverdlov to inquire whether a Don executive committee should be formed, or whether the provincial organs of neighboring provinces should oversee Soviet work on the Don. Sverdlov's response was again unambiguous: "for the time being form no Don executive committee. General direction should remain in the hands of the front's RMC. [...] There is as yet no sense in linking the temporary [regional] executive committees."70 This issue clearly loomed large in the minds of the Central Committee. On February 6, the Orgbiuro again took up the issue, and yet one more time decided that no Don organ should be established.71 The Don Bureau, however, persisted in pressing for some form of territorial organ. A gathering of Don Party officials was held on February 9, and in a letter on February 11 Syrtsov communicated the gathering's resolution on the need to form a territorial executive committee immediately.72 The Orgbiuro discussed the letter on February 14, resolving to maintain its previous position forbidding such an organ; the following day the Central Committee informed Syrtsov that the Southern Front's RMC should oversee all activity, and warned him "to permit no separate, unauthorized territorial state organs."73 The Central Committee's resolute refusal to sanction any form of separate institutional representation for the Don ? even if staffed entirely by the Don Bureau ? testifies to the depth of their distrust of the Don. While local party officials continued to press for some civilian organ (one that they would presumably staff), they simultaneously lobbied for the elimination of all forms of distinct Cossack administration. The same February 9 gathering of Don Party workers that petitioned for a territorial executive committee argued that such an organ was needed to "plan for the dismemberment (raschlenenie) of the Don Territory and to prepare for the creation of new administrative entities which correspond to the economic and political needs of the moment." The purpose of this measure was both to deny Cossacks any Don structure as a point of identification and to "dilute" the Cossack population by appending portions of neighboring non Cossack provinces. While the Central Committee rejected any independent civil organ for the Don, it sanctioned the "reorganization of districts and the division of the Don Territory into new regions" once regional congresses of soviets had met, and instructed the Don Bureau to work out plans to this end.74 Soviet officials moved ahead with plans for the dismemberment the Don Territory. In fact, various Soviet agencies fell to fighting over who would oversee the "dismemberment" of the Don Territory that had been ordered by the Central Committee.75 The Soviet apparatus attended even to the distinct titles for Cossack administrative entities within the Don Territory. Cossacks were most attached to such organs as markers of their distinctness from peasants, and the Soviet regime clearly</page><page sequence="15">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 141 wished to remove this pillar of Cossack identity. Later Lenin, in a disingenuous attempt to displace blame for "high decossackization" from the Center to local authorities, portrayed this measure as a case of local officials' immature overenthusiasm, singling out the Kotel'nikovo revolutionary committees.76 Regional revolutionary committees, however, did not take this step on their own, but were merely implementing two orders issued by the Southern Front. Order #333 (issued on March 6) abolished the "old police scheme of division for the Don Territory," and ordered the Cossack "military district" (okrug) be replaced by the more neutral "region" (raion). However the Don was not to be granted civilian administrative districts (uezdy). This order was complemented by another, issued on April 20, which renamed Cossack "stanitsy" (the administrative structures under districts) as more generic "counties" (volosti).11 These orders from the Southern Front prompted both the Kalach and Kotel'nikovo "regional" (raionnyi) revkom to reform stanitsy into counties (on April 26 and 27, respectively). The near simultaneous action of these two local organs is clearly not a coincidence. Yet Lenin's fatherly and solicitous June 3 telegram nevertheless condemns the Kotel'nikovo revolutionary committee for issuing its order #27 directing stanitsy be renamed. Lenin failed to note, however, that this order had explicitly stated that the revkom was merely carrying out the Southern Front's most recent order. (In a similar move, Stasova, the CC secretary, was trying to shift blame for decossackization from the Party Orgbiuro to the CEC (Central Executive Committee) Cossack Department ? which reacted with understandable outrage).78 The Don Bureau aggressively pursued the Territory's dismemberment, even over the objections of the Southern Front. At the 8th Party Congress in March, the Don Bureau argued strongly for administrative restructuring so as to dilute the Cossack presence. The goal was largely political ("to sow the counter-revolution's flesh to the wind"). But it was political in the sense of population politics: to engineer the demise of the Cossackry as a discrete collective entity. The Southern Front's RMC, however, believed such plans were mistimed.79 Yet the Don Bureau remained insistent. In an April meeting, it voted again to petition the Center to oversee the dismemberment of the Territory.80 The Southern Front's RMC again protested the planned dismemberment, prompting the Don Bureau to dispatch Syrtsov (the Don Bureau's most fervent proponent of decossackization) to Moscow to argue its case. Syrtsov pressed the case for dismemberment in his letter to the Central Committee on April 21, laying out plans to dilute the Cossack presence to 30% by detaching areas of the Don Territory to surrounding provinces.81 The Southern Front's RMC fired off yet another protest, charging that the situation in general and the Veshenskaia uprising in particular did not permit the break-up of existing administrative structures (yet also arguing that administration of the Don Territory ought to remain under military control).82 This opposition by the Southern Front managed to delay the Territory's dismemberment until the Soviet retreat in mid-1919, making further discussion moot. The Central Committee could forbid territorial-level organs, but it required institutional structures at some level to carry out its measures. At both the district and stanitsa level, it sanctioned the formation of revkomy, which could be replaced by commissars if necessary. Even at this level, however, the Center demonstrated its abiding distrust of the Don and its population. The Center's insistent ban on a</page><page sequence="16">142 PETER HOLQUIST territorial organ was matched by its repeated injunctions that local organs be staffed by appointment only, entirely ruling out elections. This policy was a direct result of decisions by the Center, not the Southern Front. Prior to the Orgbiuro's decossackization circular, the Southern Front's political section had issued its own directive for the civil apparatus, which kept open the possibility of elected organs. Revkomy or temporary executive committees of soviets were to be appointed, but they could also be elected from among the reliable supporters of Soviet power under the strict supervision of the political commissar in charge.83 In instructions to its regional, stanitsa and khutor commissars, the Southern Front directed them to foster socio-economic differentiation among the Cossackry and to ensure that all fields were sown and all surpluses requisitioned.84 Within two days, however, this order was superseded by the Orgbiuro's circular on decossackization, distributed to units of the Southern Front circa February 4. On February 6 the Southern Front issued Order #178, which served as the guiding light for Soviet administration of the Don. It cancelled all previous directives on administration; its first point directed that district revkomy were to be appointed by the Southern Front's RMC and would remain subordinate both to it and the Don Bureau. It proved to be the most enduring of the "high decossackization" directives, remaining in force through both the March 16 cancellation of the Orgbiuro's decossackization circular and the April 7 revocation of both Order #171 (on revolutionary tribunals) and the Southern Front's February 7 instructions for implementing decossackization (on the dismantling of "high decossackization," see below).85 Order #178 concerned only district revkomy. Among other issues, the Southern Front's February 7 "Instruction on implementing the CC directive on policy for the Don" laid down guidelines for stanitsa/county and community revolutionary committees. It explicitly established different guidelines for Cossack and peasant communities.86 There were to be no elections to posts in Cossack regions (nikakaia vybornost ' pri organizatsii vlasti v kazach yikh raionakh ne dopuskaetsia). Stanitsa executive committees were to be comprised of three Communists from the regiment that occupied it. If there were any trustworthy Communists or sympathizers among the local population, they could be appointed to the executive committee, but under no conditions were Communists from the occupying regiment to form less than a majority. In addition, the titles "of Cossack deputies" was stricken from executive committees' formulaic title (previously a soviet could include Cossack, peasant, worker and soldier deputies). And the Southern Front ensured such instructions were indeed observed. On February 19, for instance, the Southern Front scolded the X Army that "according to the CC's decision, elected organs of authority at the present moment are IMPERMISSIBLE. Take measures TO LIQUIDATE IMMEDIATELY THE KACHALINSKAIA DISTRICT EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. The composition of your Revkom will be confirmed within two days upon Syrtsov's arrival."87 In contrast, the instruction counseled that "in peasant regions, considering the eternally-existing antagonism between them and the Cossacks, as well as their more revolutionary mood, one must pursue a different policy. Elected authority is permissible, but it must be conducted in an organized manner and with</page><page sequence="17">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 143 the proper preparation, nominating the candidates beforehand and only then electing them at the gatherings (nametiv zar anee kandidatov, a potom uzhe golosovaf ikh na skhodakh). In general bring them to the level of the peasantry of all of Soviet Russia." Clearly, the Southern Front evinced no great trust in even the peasants' ability to select the correct candidate, but more significant still is the differentiated guidelines for Cossack and peasant regions. IV The balance To evaluate high decossackization, we must address the interpretation presented by the Soviet state after the cancellation of its policy. The regime presented the events of "high decossackization" in retrospect as anomalous excesses by local officials, subsequently corrected by a diligent and solicitous Soviet state. Was decossackization excess, or policy? It is indisputable that the officials charged with carrying out decossackization interpreted it in the broadest possible terms. In reviewing the policy, many reports excoriated the quality of personnel staffing local organs. The commissar in Slashchevskaia is reported to have claimed that he wanted "to drive Cossacks to their grave," a sentiment shared by some Khoper officials.88 It must be remembered, however, that the Center itself, at its own insistence, was responsible for appointing these individuals, and had done little to revise these officials' understanding of decossackization. Even more fundamentally, the Center set the parameters of acceptable behavior. It signalled the limits of appropriate behavior by explicit directives and tacit sanction of local organs' policies. Decossackization was not the product of vindictive peasants or even zealous local officials, but was made possible by the Central Committee and the Soviet military-party-state apparatus, which explicitly condoned these policies and created an atmosphere of tolerance for them.89 Regardless of the Center's later denials, it not only was aware of local organs' actions and did nothing to correct them, but was in fact often instrumental in prodding these organs to be more aggressive in their implementation of its policies. We have already discussed how political-military superiors from the Army RMCs pressed both the Ust'-Medveditsa and Khoper revkomy to show greater "firmness" in prosecuting counterrevolutionaries. The story was similar in other districts, where the arrival of centrally-appointed extraordinary commissions signalled the intensification of repression. Upon its occupation, the inhabitants of Veshenskaia experienced intermittent robberies, but were assured that the arrival of an extraordinary investigative commission would put an end to this. An extraordinary commission did indeed arrive, but it came to replace the existing Inzenskaia divisional tribunal, whose members were placed before a coll?gial court for the "weakness" they had displayed in their posts. The extraordinary commission then demonstrated how "firmer" policies were to be carried out: whereas people had previously been executed in parties of 5, they now began to be executed in groups of 50. In Tsymlianskaia as well, "actual Petrograd commissars" (in the words of one</page><page sequence="18">144 PETER HOLQUIST account by survivors) arrived to remove the existing ones, and oversaw a sharp increase in executions.90 The case of the Morozovskaia revkom demonstrates both how the Center pressed its policies and how it subsequently sought to distance itself from them. The atrocities in Morozovskaia, while not as extensive as those in other regions, crop up in almost every account of decossackization.91 We know so much about the executions (the 64 or 65 corpses found in the Morozovskaia barn figure in nearly every treatment) because Boguslavksii, the local commissar, became the scapegoat for the entire policy of decossackization. The Morozovskaia revkom, like all others, was appointed, with Boguslavskii as its head.92 Observing overall policy, Boguslavskii soon began to execute groups of people. These executions disturbed the population and soon led even local Army and Party officials to accuse him of crossing over from zealousness into criminality. He described his predicament to a local Party representative who came to complain about the number of executions. While local officials accused him of being overenthusiastic, the head of the X Army's Don Department, Musin, had reprimanded him for being too "weak" and had instructed him to be more "energetic." Bewildered, Boguslavskii asked the Party delegate whom he should obey: the local Party organization protesting his "excesses," or his military superiors, pressing for an even more energetic application of terror? Indeed, it was in direct response to Musin's call for more "energetic" policies that Boguslavskii had taken out and executed all 64 people held in the prison, who were then buried. (These are the infamous corpses later disinterred to indict Boguslavskii and invoked in all subsequent accounts of decossackization). The winds were changing, however. The Center abjured its policy of "high decossackization" in mid-March (see below). In April the Morozovskaia district Party organization arrested Boguslavskii, informing the Don Bureau of their action. In order to sate public opinion, the IX Army revolutionary tribunal publicly tried Boguslavskii and his colleagues for "their" crimes. The trial was closely orchestrated. The Don Bureau gave its approval to the investigation, dispatched a representative to supervise the case and closely followed its course. Despite protestations that they were merely carrying out orders from military superiors, Boguslavskii and two other defendants were sentenced to death. Upon confirmation by the CC, the sentence was carried out on May 8.93 Boguslavskii was the most visible scapegoat, but not the only one. In the same month, a commissar in Khoper district (Frolov) was sentenced to death for protecting the bourgeoisie in return for bribes and his sentence was widely broadcast in the district organ.94 Their near simultaneous fall from grace, in the aftermath of the policy reversal, can hardly be a coincidence. While both Boguslavskii and Frolov undoubtedly were guilty of what they had been charged with, they had not acted on their own. Boguslavskii paid for the policies he had been pressured to carry out. Casting Boguslavskii as responsible for the "excesses" of decossackization allowed all subsequent critics of the policy to cite Morozovskaia as an example of how the policy had been "mis-applied." The ubiquitous discussion of Morozovskaia in the subsequent reviews by Party officials (reviews which have served as historians' most basic source for decossackization) ensured that Morozovskaia entered the historical literature as the paradigmatic example of the failed policy.</page><page sequence="19">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 145 V Decossackization by other means: March-April 1919 High decossackization was thus clearly a policy proclaimed by Soviet authorities and pursued throughout February and March 1919. Accounts of it as an uninterrupted orgy of slaughter, however, fail to trace the Center's staged retreat from the policy over the course of mid-1919. Decossackization as "total [physical] extirpation" was replaced by decossackization as the elimination of a social class. Revolutionary tribunals did not cease their activities, but the scope of their activities was sharply circumscribed. Prompted by the Veshenskaia uprising, the Soviet regime abjured its calls for the elimination of Cossacks as Cossacks, although it continued to prescribe merciless retribution for those who raised arms against the Revolution. That is, the policy shifted from punishing Cossacks for who they were to punishing them for what they had done. The struggle over the means best suited to these ends pitted the more extreme Syrtsov and the Don Bureau against Sokol'nikov and the more moderate Southern Front. Even before the Veshenskaia uprising, central authorities began to modify some of their more extreme policies. The Don Bureau had never made peace with the Center's total ban on a territorial organ. The Southern Front did not favor the ban either. (It did, however, insist on retaining control over all work in the Territory, testifying not only to its reluctance to surrender authority but also to its abiding distrust of the Don Bureau, and specifically Syrtsov). As a result of their joint prodding, the Center finally relented somewhat. It remained opposed to the formation of a regular, provincial-level organ (executive or revolutionary committee) analogous to other regions, but it sanctioned the formation of the "Civil Administration attached to the Southern Front's RMC" (Grazhdanskoe upravlenie pri Rewoensovete Iuzhnogo Fronta) known by the ugly acronym "Grazhdupr." Control would remain in the hands of the Army, but at least now it would be exercised through an organ devoted specifically to civilian affairs. The Civil Administration alone was granted authority over liberated regions, and it was to be in direct contact with district revkomy, which it could dismiss at its discretion. The Don Bureau, while disappointed at the continued dominance of the Southern Front, acceded to the Civil Administration's formation in the interests of military expediency.95 The Civil Administration was the organ responsible for carrying out policies on the Don, and as such became the forum where the struggle between the Southern Front and the Don Bureau was played out. In the second week of March the Veshenskaia uprising broke out against Soviet power. It encompassed most of the Upper Don district, precisely the same region which only a month and a half earlier had thrown open the front to the Red Army. It also prompted Soviet officials to review their policy on the Don. The Southern Front, which had long opposed the Don Bureau's more extreme policies, invoked the uprising as an argument for a more restrained approach to the region. Sokol'nikov, a member of the Southern Front's RMC, presented a report to the Cen tral Committee arguing that the Orgbiuro's decossackization circular could not be fulfilled. Instead he insisted that the rift between the northern and southern districts was a sufficient basis for socio-economic differentiation "without our unnecessary</page><page sequence="20">146 PETER HOLQUIST interference." (Generally, the southern districts were wealthier and thus perceived to be more conservative). In contrast to the Orgbiuro's original action on the circular, which was not placed before the Central Committee, the March 15 meeting of the Orgbiuro decided to lay the issue of cancelling the circular before the entire Central Committee. The following day the Central Committee endorsed Sokol'nikov's analysis, passing a resolution that called for an end to "actions against the Cossackry." It cannot be a coincidence that the next issue discussed was the competence of the Don Bureau, a topic forwarded to the Orgbiuro (which seems to have taken no action).96 Syrtsov forwarded news of the Central Committee's change in policy to regional authorities on March 25:97 "Immediatly inform all responsible Party and Soviet leaders of your region that the CC has reviewed its directive and directs Party workers to cease the implementation of mass terror. Take absolutely no measures which might complicate relations and lead to an uprising. Economic measures ? especially requisitions ? should be pursued with the utmost caution and circumspection. [...] Removing individual counterrevolutionaries who are harmful is of course necessary. The Veshenskaia uprising should of course be suppressed with all decisiveness and mercilessness, but repressions ought not be extended indiscriminately to stanitsy that have not rebelled. It is of course necessary to employ more severity towards the southern Cossackry, but not to excess." While the document is no model of humanitarianism, it nevertheless represents a major shift from high decossackization. Terror is still the order of the day ? but only for those who engage in counterrevolutionary acts. The Cossackry in toto is no longer the target. Nor is it any longer self-evident that the Cossackry is some monolithic, elementally counterrevolutionary bloc. The putative economic differentiation between Cossacks in the northern and southern districts is now invoked, and would continue to be invoked in the future, to explain their counterrevolutionary tendencies.98 That is, Cossacks were no longer assumed simply to be congenital counterrevolutionaries; reasons, class reasons, now had to be advanced to explain their behavior. Two weeks later, another more sweeping decree further dismantled the legal structures underpinning high decossackization.99 On April 5, the Southern Front issued an order annulling almost all previous orders directed specifically against Cossacks. Namely, it cancelled Order #171 on revolutionary tribunals, Order #248 on confiscating carriages from Cossacks and Order #369 on confiscating saddles from the Cossack population. The Southern Front also cancelled its own February 7 "Instructions" to the January 24 Orgbiuro circular (which itself had already been annulled three weeks before). The order directed an overall change in Soviet policy on the Don: "In place of all previous instructions concerning general policy for the Don Territory, the Southern Front's RMC orders the following be observed: suppress attempts at uprising in the rear in the most merciless manner, while simultaneously not resorting to mass terror towards peaceful regions and persecuting only active counterrevolutionaries." The shift in views on the Cossackry, visible in Syrtsov's earlier directive, is evident here as well. No longer is the Cossackry in toto to be subject to terror, but</page><page sequence="21">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 147 only "active counterrevolutionaries," specifically those engaged in the Upper Don insurgency. (Many accounts of decossackization erroneously lump these later measures against insurgents together with the earlier and much broader decossackization measures). Yet, while forced to abjure his more extreme variant of high decossackization, Syrtsov retained his belief in the correctness of the policy. He placed all responsibility for its failure not on the policy itself, but on the Army's inability or unwillingness to carry it out. The Don Bureau's continued intransigence is evident in its April 8 "Resolution on policy towards the Cossacks."100 Coming only three days after the Southern Front's cancellation of the essential components of high decossackization, the Don Bureau's policy statement opens with a proclamation that "the existence of the Don Cossackry stands before proletarian power as a constant threat of counterrevolutionary rebellion." The Cossack threat therefore "makes vital the question of the complete, immediate and decisive destruction of the Cossackry as a specific cultural (bytovoi) and economic group, the destruction of its economic foundations, the physical elimination of the Cossack bureaucrats and officers (indeed, of the entire counterrevolutionary Cossack elite), the dispersal and neutralization of the rank-and-file Cossackry and the formal liquidation of the Cossackry." While conceding that terror should be employed only as a "justified retribution" for counterrevolutionary actions, the resolution counsels the confiscation of land from Cossacks and the imposition of "contributions" and special taxes on the Cossackry. Its primary recommendation, however, was for the Soviet state to pursue a policy of massive resettlement "of peasant elements from Central Russia" to the Don. Once again we see that Syrtsov was thinking explicitly in terms of modern population politics, both concerning policy goals as well as assumptions about the appropriate tools to secure them. Clearly, Syrtsov's view of the Cossackry and the measures necessary to neutralize it had changed little. His hard-line approach caused a split within even the Don Bureau. While four members (led by Syrtsov) supported the resolution's firm line, two others (led by Frenkel') accused the majority of failing to incorporate the Center's new policy.101 Syrtsov took his case to the Central Committee, traveling personally to Moscow and submitting a lengthy policy proposal there on April 21.102 In his proposal he forcefully argued for the dismemberment of the Don Territory and proposed that the regime rely on the peasantry in pursuing the Cossackry's elimination. The Don Bureau's continued insistence on hard-line measures, together with its charge that the Army was to blame for decossackization's failure, brought it into conflict with the Southern Front's RMC. On behalf of the Southern Front, Sokol'nikov exchanged recriminations by telegraph with the Don Bureau. The Southern Front, aware that Syrtsov was traveling to meet the Central Committee, sent a telegram of its own. In it Sokol'nikov ridiculed the Don Bureau's charge that decossackization had failed because the original directive was not implemented. As proof he cited figures confirming the "broad implementation" of the directive in the area now seized by rebellion. He then went on to charge that the Don Bureau had "not changed its policy at all, which entirely corresponds to its view that the original directive had simply not been given a chance to work."103</page><page sequence="22">148 PETER HOLQUIST Syrtsov's trip to Moscow paid dividends. The Central Committee gave its approval to the Don Bureau's "Resolution on the Cossackry." Over the continued objections of the Southern Front, the Center entertained plans for the immediate dismemberment of the Don province (see above on this) and allowed resettlement to go forward. Following Syrtsov's advice, on April 24 the CEC ordered the Commissariat of Agriculture to supervise the resettlement of peasants from six northern provinces to "the former Don Territory."104 By May 1 the first parties of settlers arrived on the Don, where they were directed to the Kotel'nikovo and Millerovo regions. Although several hundred families were settled, the Soviet retreat prevented resettlement on any massive scale. While the Soviet state remained suspicious of Cossacks, we must distinguish this second period from high decossackization proper. Soviet policy-makers (other than Syrtsov) by and large abandoned the view that Cossacks as a population were the physical carriers of counterrevolution and now instead sought the "formal" economic and juridical abolition of the Cossackry as an estate. While the Soviet regime now pursued various means to dismantle the Cossackry as a juridical and economic entity, it no longer called for the widespread extirpation of individual Cossacks as Cossacks. Here we see the significance of the state endorsing particular views of the body politic. Not a few officials had opposed the portrayal of all Cossacks as dedicated counterrevolutionaries, but once this view was endorsed by the Orgbiuro, it was actively implemented. Likewise, while many retained their distrust of each and every Cossack after the renunciation of high decossackization, without sanction from on high they proved much less able to act on these views. VI Policy r??valuation and retreat: the normalization of the Cossackry and the Don As summer approached, the Red Army not only failed to bring the Veshenskaia rebellion under control but was soon forced to begin retreating from the Don. As the Soviet forces retreated, the central authorities engaged in an extensive review to determine why they had lost the Don. This review generated many reports from the primary actors, most of whom fixed responsibility upon the decossackization policy in general, all the while avoiding any blame for those who actually ordered it. In March the 8th Party Congress had signalled a general retreat in Soviet policy by calling for accommodation with the "middle peasant." At that time the new line was not applied to the Don, because the Cossackry was still viewed as monolithically prosperous: "Cossacks" were Cossacks first and foremost, rather than poor, middle or wealthy peasants who happened to be of the Cossack estate. Significantly, however, economic arguments were increasingly invoked, rather than the Cossackry's irreducible nature, to explain their allegiance to counterrevolution. In April the Center continued to act upon Syrtsov's recommendations, but by May the Soviet government had begun a general, overall review of its policy for the Don. The Council of People's Commissars on May 24 ordered a study of whether the rights of the Cossack population should be made equal with those of the rest of the Soviet Republic's laboring population and, if so, what steps should be taken.105</page><page sequence="23">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 149 Cossacks were described as analogous to the rest of the laboring population ? although even this formulation continued to categorize them as distinct. Here, however, was a major shift in perception: while separate, Cossacks now were considered equivalent to the rest of the population. The effects of this shift were felt almost immediately. On May 12, the Republic's Revolutionary-Military Committee permitted Cossacks to bear arms in defense of the Republic.106 And these policies cascaded down the chain-of-command. By the end of May the Khoper revkom proclaimed in a broadsheet that only provocateurs could be spreading rumors about the Soviet state's alleged intention to extirpate the Cossackry. (The Veshenskaia insurgents had been using captured Soviet directives as agitational material to great effect.) No, argued Larin: the 8th Party Congress had decreed punishment for any Communist who harmed a middle Cossack or middle peasant (seredniak-kazak Hi seredniak-krest'ianin). Of course, this corrective was only now being introduced to the Don. He then threatened punishment for any officials who abused the "middle peasantry," here meaning primarily Cossacks who had just been included under this category.107 Once the Soviet state had endorsed this view, Cossacks were no longer a monolithic exploitative class, but on the contrary were merely an estate rent by the very same class categories as all other groups. The primary identification was no longer "Cossack" but "class." By mid-summer, both Frenkel' and Trifonov (opponents of decossackization's excesses) were condemning the previous policy as non-Marxist. They called for a "class" approach to the Cossackry rather than one which viewed the Cossackry as an entirely different species.108 The change in policy made evident the Center's role in creating the environment sanctioning the previous policy's pervasive violence. Officials attested that upon receipt of directives from above to moderate policy, the rate of executions dropped precipitously, in some cases by the very next day.109 Even where the Center had not directly ordered executions, it had hitherto communicated its tolerance for such actions. As soon as it communicated its non-acceptance, the "local excesses" ceased. (It was also at this time that Lenin sought to displace responsibility for the failed policy onto "overenthusiastic" local officials, much as Stalin was later to do with his "Dizzy with success" article.) The Center's review of overall policy generated a veritable flood of reports evaluating what was already recognized as a failed policy. It is these reports, rather than the documents of the policy's actual implementation, that have subsequently served as the primary source for accounts of decossackization. The reports' authors, however, were already writing with the knowledge that decossackization had been repudiated, a fact that inevitably shaped their presentation of it. The most frequently cited complex of reports, those submitted to the Cossack section, were in fact solicited by the section's chairman to strengthen his case for a change in policy toward the Don (and, incidentally, for a greater role for the Cossack section in formulating policy).110 The Cossack section was not the only agency soliciting such reports. The Central Committee also commissioned a wave of reports analyzing the policy's failure, and these have served as the other primary lode for scholars investigating decossackization.111 In early June, the Soviet Republic's Revolutionary-Military Tribunal conducted its own investigation into the causes of the rebellion, coming to the unsurprising conclusion that the Central Committee's circular had been misdirected and had laid the foundations for the uprising.112</page><page sequence="24">150 PETER HOLQUIST As a result of the fevered analysis, the Center moved to "normalize" both the Cossackry and the Don Territory. At the beginning of 1919, the Center had signalled the Don's distinctness by refusing to permit a normal, regional-level civil organ (recall the Don Bureau's vain struggle for a Don revolutionary committee (revkom)). The Don had not been granted one because it was envisioned as particularly malevolent, in contrast to other, normal provinces. Even after high decossackization ended, distrust of the Don and its Cossack population was so great that the Center allowed it only the Civil Administration, a direct extension of the Southern Front. In late April, however, a CEC-sponsored review of policy towards Cossack regions came to the conclusion that the administration of the Don could not entirely be left in the hands of the military and called for administration to pass to soviet civil organs of provinces bordering the Don.113 Soon afterward the Central Committee did much more than that: in the first days of May it reorganized the Civil Administration as a five-man Don Revolutionary Committee (DRK) "along the lines of a provincial executive committee" (i.e., on the model of all other provinces).114 Although summoned into being on paper, the five members of the DRK did not assemble for some time (due primarily to illness of several members).115 The change at the territorial level also meant changes at the local level. Gerasimov, one of the five members of the DRK (and the only one in place at the end of the month) argued on May 21 that the time when all district revkomy were appointed (as per Order #178, the only order from the period of high decossackization still in place) had passed, and that "the time had come to create democratic soviets ? even artificially ? in areas liberated from the opponent."116 The change in form from appointed revolutionary committees to soviets, even artificially elected ones, demonstrated a major shift in attitude to the Cossacks and the Don in general. The Cossackry was normalized in other respects as well. It was in this period that the Commissariat of Internal Affairs discussed "the question of equalling the rights of the Cossack population with the rest of the laboring population," and the Khoper revkom issued its order threatening punishment to Communists who harmed "middle-Cossacks or middle-peasants." With the Soviet retreat, the issue became academic. Yet the normalization continued throughout the late summer and early autumn. The Civil Administration was finally dissolved and its affairs transferred to the DRK on August 28. On September 3 the Orgbiuro met to discuss what form civil authority for the Don should take and, in stark contrast to its earlier January circular, approved the formation of appointed soviets, with the possibility of partial elections in the foreseeable future. Later that same month the DRK took the symbolically significant step of renaming itself the "Provisional Don Executive Committee," with the corresponding change of "district revkomy" into "provisional district executive committees." Even stanitsa, village and khutor revkomy now were to bear the title of "soviets." And while district executive committees were to still be appointed, elections were to be permitted for khutor and stanitsa soviets.117 To be sure, these changes were often nominal (the change in title from "revkom" to "provisional executive committee" did not change the composition), and any elections would be strictly controlled. But what is important here is that the mechanism and degree of control would be the same as for any other province.</page><page sequence="25">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 151 The complete rehabilitation of the Cossacks and the Don came in September. A September 4 article in the IX Army's newspaper foretold the official shift. The article instructed soldiers that:118 "While it is true that a certain portion of the Don Territory's population is counter revolutionary for reasons of an economic nature, this is far from the majority. And this entire remaining section of the population could become our ally. Why then haven't they? One can't blame everything on ignorance and benightedness. We must admit that we repeated the same story on the Don that we had earlier in Siberia and Central Russia. Quite some time ago we came to recognize our mistake in Siberia, and even earlier we recognized our mistake toward the middle peasant in Central Russia ? now it's the Don's turn. It is entirely understandable that in the heat of battle, particularly after such a fierce one, one cannot expect special kindness from warriors to their foes, but we are entitled to demand a strict distinction between friend and foe. [...] Be attentive, comrades, to the Don middle-Cossack (k donskomu seredniaku-kazaku)." [emphasis in original.] The new line, in other words, entirely contradicts the early 1919 one. Recall that, in his article on "the struggle with the Don," Vatsetis had argued that the Don Cossackry was so benighted that it bore a resemblance to an entirely different species. Now a Red Army newspaper declared that the Cossacks themselves are not solely to blame for their behavior, but Soviet "mistakes" had played no small role in shaping Cossacks' response to Soviet power. Cossacks, it transpired, were not incorrigible counterrevolutionaries; given the proper policy, even they could be won over to Soviet power. The new line received official formulation two weeks later. On September 16 Trotskii convened a conference in Balashov to discuss political work among the Cossacks. On the basis of this gathering he drew up "Theses about work on the Don." The Orgbiuro discussed Trotskii's theses on September 18 and 19, and published them in Izvestiia on September 30.119 The "Theses" argued that Soviet power should win over the Cossackry through agitation rather than force. This view was focused on a different Cossackry than the January 24 decossackization circular. Point #10 of the "Theses" declared that the political groupings of the Cossackry generally corresponded to poor, middle and well-off categories present among the peasantry in general. But Soviet policy now repudiated even a strict class analysis. The "Theses" proclaimed that the deciding criteria would not be one's economic category but one's attitude to the Red Army. Soviet power would punish only those who actively rejected it. The policy had come full circle. In January Cossacks were presumed counterrevolutionary by nature, even despite acts on behalf of Soviet power; in September they were considered potential allies, barring any outright opposition. Even the nature of a "counterrevolutionary act" had changed. In January it was merely a symptom or manifestation of a counterrevolutionary essence presumed already to exist within the Cossackry. Hence the only options were either to preempt it through terror ("for the middle Cossackry it is necessary to take all steps that guarantee no further attempts on its part to rise against Soviet power") or root it out by exterminating the carriers of counterrevolution ("by means of total extirpation"). In September the focus had shifted to the act itself. In January a counterrevolutionary was presumed to make the act; in September the act made the counterrevolutionary.</page><page sequence="26">152 PETER HOLQUIST Conclusion This article has focused on "decossackization" in all its manifestations. In particular, it has presented the dynamic of the policy's formulation and implementation. By doing so, one can avoid the tendentiousness of other accounts, which have either merely reproduced the Center's mid-1919 attempt to displace responsibility onto local organs or those which have become so absorbed with the "terror" decrees that they fail to note that the policy underwent a process of gradual transformation. Decossackization was policy, but one which changed over time. The task then is to trace its changing goals and the methods employed to achieve them. What was distinct about high decossackization was that it sought to eliminate a population for what it was presumed to be rather than for what it had done. This policy was not a product flowing so much from the Civil Warper se but from Soviet ways of conceiving and managing the population. It is for this reason that decossackization should be seen not just as an epiphenomenon of the Civil War, but as a demonstration of the Soviet propensity for fashioning a particular vision of society instead. Neither decossackization nor dekulakization were deviations or anomalies, but represent instead conjunctures when the regime thought it possible to act on long-standing policy goals ? to create a socialist society through managing its human, just as much as its raw, materials. Yet I wish to close with a caveat. Decossackization was a particularly ruthless attempt to realize what Zygmunt Bauman has termed the ideal of the "gardening state." Yet socialism here was merely implementing, for its own ends and in a Marxist key, ways of seeing and manipulating the population that were emerging at the turn of the twentieth century. If decossackization should be viewed from the vantage point of dekulakization, it must also be read alongside the wide-spread tendency emerging at this time to practice political hygiene on the body politic by excising those "elements" deemed to be malignant and unreliable, be they classes or ethnic groups. During the First World War (only four years prior to decossackization), the emphatically non-socialist tsarist regime had engaged in its own ethnic form of population politics through its massive forced deportations of "the Jewish element." Nor was this a purely Russian phenomenon: internment camps, concentration camps, population transfers, ethnic cleansing ? the political vocabulary of the twentieth century testifies to the ubiquity of population politics. Socialism acted ruthlessly against "alien" classes. What was unique to socialism, however, was that it acted on classes, not that it sought to manipulate populations. We cannot absolve socialists of decossackization by dismissing it simply as the product of the Russian Civil War. Nor, however, can we dismiss population management and social engineering as a solely socialist or totalitarian propensity. There was a particularly socialist way to secure a healthy body politic. But in pursuing population politics for fostering a better, purer political community, the Soviet state was only practicing a variation ? no doubt a particularly forceful one ? of a more universal, modern theme.120 Cornell University, Ithaca, 1996.</page><page sequence="27">DECOSSACKIZATION ON THE DON 153 IMPORTANT DECREES ON DECOSSACKIZATION, 1919 /.

Other formulations, however, portray the Civil War as some external, natural event that perverts an otherwise more humanistic Bolshevik ethos (or at least closes off certain possible avenues of development). For the formulation of the Civil War as exercising a brutalizing effect on Bolshevism, see Stephen Cohen, "Bolshevism and Stalinism," in Robert Tucker, ed., Stalinism (New York: Norton, 1977): 15-16,21. The most useful critique of this "theory of circumstances" (in this case, the "circumstance" of the Civil War) is Reginald Zelnik, "Circumstance and political will in the Russian Civil War," in Party, state and society..., op. cit.: 374-381. 3. For the argument that the policies of 1928-1929 can be productively viewed as the reapplication of measures first put into practice in 1920-1921, and that these policies formed "a common patrimony" for all Party members ? and "as such they returned in 1928," see Andrea Graziosi, "Piatakov's Donbass in 1921: At the roots of Soviet industrial relations and practices," Cahiers du Monde russe, XXXVI, 1-2 (1995): 130-131. In addition to decossackization, one might view the extended campaigns against Antonov and Makhno as another key point of comparison with the later dekulakization campaign; on this, see Viktor Danilov, ed., Antonovshchina: dokumenty i materialy (Tambov, 1994). 4.

Most evident in tendentious attempts to portray both Trotskii and Sverdlov (often referred to by their original Jewish last names) as the originators and main proponents of this policy. E.g., Evgenii Losev's Mironov (Moscow, 1991) explicitly identifies heartless Jews as originators of the "genocidal" decossackization policy (see pp. 306-307 for truly crude anti-semitic statements).

Most Western scholars, however, lump general anti-Cossack policies together with the measures employed against the Veshenskaia insurgents; for example, see V. Brovkin, op. cit.: 105-106; also V.L. Genis, art. cit.: 46-48. 13. On this, as well as later Soviet policy to the Don Cossacks, see D'Ann Penner's important "Pride, power and pitchforks: A study of farmer-Party interaction on the Don, 1920-1928" (Berkeley, Ph.D. dissertation, 1995). 14. See Robert McNeal, Tsar and Cossack (New York: St. Martin's, 1987): 220, 256, citing articles from 1901, 1904 and 1910. 15. Bernshtam and Brovkin rightly identify this outlook as an essential precondition of decossackization, but treat it as a view intrinsic to socialism in general. This argument overlooks changing Soviet attitudes to the Cossackry; in 1920, the Soviet state's "class enemies" were no longer Cossacks in toto, but the officer and kulak elite, regardless of whether it was peasant or Cossack. For an examination of the later reemergence of ethnic categorization by the Soviet regime during the 1930's ? and the similar consequences which resulted ? see Terry Martin, "Soviet nationalities policy, 1923-1938" (Ph.D. dissertation, University of Chicago, 1996). 16.

Detlev Peukert has suggested that an essential precondition of the Holocaust was the evolution of the concept in the human and social sciences of society as Volksk?rper, the body of the nation. The purpose for examining this "body" was to secure the greater health of the whole by excising "useless" or "malignant" elements; see "The genesis of the 'final solution' from the spirit of science," in T. Childers and J. Caplan, eds, Reevaluating the Third Reich (New York: Holmes and Meier, 1993): 234-252. Zygmunt Bauman has described this ethos as the modernist fantasy of the "gardening state" to shape and cultivate (including excising pernicious components) society as artifact: see Modernity and the Holocaust (Ithaca: Cornell, 1991): 13, 18, 70-82. Similarly, decossackization was predicated on an idea of fostering a class-pure body politic (or at least one not polluted by counterrevolution) by excising malignant "elements" such as the Cossackry. 22.

Military statistics had deemed Jews of the western provinces a particularly unreliable "element," describing them as loyal only to their own pocket-books: e.g., "the Jew-cosmopolitans (evrei-kosmopolity) [...] always and everywhere pursue trading to the exclusion of all else, and here ? as everywhere ? they will likely serve us and our foes with equal enthusiasm"; and again, "the Jews, who here as elsewhere in the Western border region exploit the population, but as is the case everywhere worry only about their own interests" (A.M. Zolotarev, op. cit., 11: 31,275; see also pp. 92, 163); see also A.M. Zolotarev, Voenno-statisticheskii ocherk okrain Rossii: kurs voennykh i iunkerskikh uchilishch (St. Petersburg, 1903): 18 for similar statements in a textbook for secondary military schools. On the forced deportation of Jews, Germans, Gypsies and others, see S. Nelipovich, "V poiskakh 'vnutrennego vraga': deportatsionnaia politika Rossii (1914-1917)," in Pervaia mirovaia voina i uchastie v nei Rossii (1914-1918), 2 vols (Moscow, 1994) I: 51-64; Daniel Graf, "Military rule behind the Russian Front," Jahrb?cher f?r Geschichte Osteuropas, 3 (1974): 390-411; and Mark von Hagen, "The Great War and the emergence of modern Ukraine," in Richard Barnett, Empire, nations, regions: Political order and change in the former Soviet space (forthcoming). Most of these works overlook the role of military statistics in shaping perceptions, ascribing the Army's policy either to ingrained anti-semitism (D. Graf, art. cit.: 397-398) or dating these views only from the outbreak of the war (S. Nelipovich, art. cit.: 52 in an otherwise very enlightening treatment). For an incisive treatment of Turkish policies towards the Armenian population and the subsequent Armenian genocide, see Ronald G. Suny, "Nation-making, nation breaking and the end of empire: New perspectives on the events of 1915," paper presented at the Fourth Annual Vardanants Day Armenian Lecture, Librar)7 of Congress, May 1, 1996. 24. On how war simply became the matrix within which various national forms of mobilization and organization were played out, see Michael Geyer, "The militarization of Europe, 1914-1945," in The militarization of the Western world (New Brunswick: Rutgers, 1989): esp. p. 94; Elisabeth Domansky, "Militarization and reproduction in World War I Germany," in Geoff Eley, ed, Society, culture and the state in Germany, 1870-1930 (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1996): 427-463, esp. at 429-431; and Bernd H?ppauf, "Langenmarck, Verdun and the myth of a new man in Germany after the First World War," War and Society, 6, 2 (September 1988): 70-103, here at 91-92. 25.

Note that here too Imperial military statistics had led the way: V.V. Lobachevskii, op. cit.: 309-317, had effectively collapsed the categories "ethnically Russian" and "Cossack" together, in opposition to "ethnically Ukrainian" and "non-Cossack" (although the overlap was less than precise in both cases). In other words, by 1908 military statisticians had come to think preeminently in ethnic terms when they sought to determine subjects' likely loyalty. 29.

Bauman is instructive: "Cancer, vermin or weed cannot repent. They have not sinned, they just lived according to their nature. There is nothing to punish them for. By the nature of their evil, they have to be exterminated" (op. cit.: 72). One might speculate that a similar shift from "class enemies" to "enemies of the people" in the 1930's accounts in part for the astronomic increase in executions. The Polish officers executed at Katyn were executed, in the very words of the decree ordering the massacre, "proceeding from the fact that they all are inveterate and incorrigible foes of Soviet power (iskhodia iz togo, chto vse oni iavliaiutsia zakorenelymi, neispravnymi vragami sovetskoi vlastiy ? that is, since they cannot be reformed, the only solution left is to root them out. See the documents in Voprosy istorii, 1 (1993): 18. 32. Thus, despite the frequent contemporary references to the French Republic's struggle with the Vend?e, the Bolsheviks had conceptually moved beyond the Jacobins: Montagnard agents on mission ruthlessly dispatched those caught committing counterrevolutionary deeds; the Bolsheviks ordered the preventative execution of those who were merely presumed ready and willing to do such deeds. 33.

Cossacks wore a distinguishing trouser stripe, with a specific color for each Cossack host; the Don's was red. 36. A.V. Venkov, Donskoe kazachestvo..., op. cit: 54. 37. L. Trotskii, "A word to Cossacks and about Cossacks," from December 10: Kak vooruzhalalas' revoliutsiia (Moscow, 1923) I: 359-360. 38. See the analogous argument by D. Peukert, art. cit. The paradigm of selection and even elimination had long been present in scientific thought; but only when one single branch of modern social thought (racism in Peukert's case, but this holds equally true for class-based analysis) receives supreme state backing, both to test its methods and, ultimately, to put them into practice, does something like the Holocaust become possible. 39. For the period in question, the commander of the Southern Front was V.M. Gittis (24 January 13 July 1919) and V.N. Egor'ev (13 July-11 October 1919); members of the Southern Front's Revolutionary-Military Council (RMC) numbered G.Ia. Sokol'nikov (1 December 1918-6 October 1919), I.I. Khodorovskii (17 January-6 July 1919); A.L. Kolegaev (24 January-18 June 1919); K.A. Mekhonoshin (3 October 1918-26 January 1919; 15 June-13 July 1919); A.I. Okulov, M.K. Vladimirov, L.P. Serebriakov and M.M. Lashevich all were added at various times in the summer of 1919. Note that Stalin ceased to serve on the Southern Front's RMC in October 1918, and returned in October 1919; he thus was not a direct participant in the decossackization policy. 40. RGVA, f. 100, op. 2, d. 94,1. 51. 41. RGVA, f. 100, op. 2, d. 51,1. 250. 42. The precise role of Syrtsov or the Don Bureau in drafting the circular is not entirely clear. In reports solicited in July during a review of the failed policy, both Larin (GARF, f. 1235, op. 82, d. 15,1. 320) and Trifonov (RTsKhlDNI, f. 17, op. 65, d. 34,1. 85) charge that Syrtsov and the Don Bureau were instrumental in its composition. I.I. Dedov (op. cit.: 74-75) confirms the major role played by Syrtsov in formulating this decree. A. Kozlov (art. cit.: 66), in an attempt to blame "the apparatus" for decossackization, seems to make a rare error in absolving the Don Bureau of a role in its formulation. 43. Izvestiia TsKKPSS, 6 (1989): 177-178. Information on the drafting of and deliberations over the circular is most elusive. I have been unable to determine precisely why the Orgbiuro, rather than the entire Central Committee, issued the circular. Even the circular itself is absent from the protocol; only a copy exists in the Party archives. 44. RTsKhlDNI, f. 554, op. 1, d. 1, 1. 67 (Ust'-Medveditsa district gathering of commissars, March 25,1919). In determining the number of the Cossack "elite," we may disregard the extensive Soviet historical literature on differentiation, as what mattered was how contemporary definitions would be applied. The Southern Front's "Instruction to khutor commissars" defined "wealthy" to mean (1) those who permanently employ hired labor; or (2) those who had surpluses and who then "speculated" with them (RGVA, f. 100, op. 2, d. 51, 1. 249). While the number of Cossacks employing permanent hired labor was relatively low (roughly 8%), the number "speculating" in surpluses, given the elastic meanings applied both to "surplus" and "speculation," would have been quite large, if not nearly universal (is a poor Cossack selling grain in spring "speculating"? No, if the Soviet commissar so decides; but yes, should he wish to make that argument). 45.

Venkov, Pechat'..., op. cit.: 135; for protocols of meetings of the Don Bureau upon receiving the report of Boguslavskii's arrest (Apr. 21), dispatching a representative to "eliminate the violations" (Apr. 22), and conditionally approving his death sentence in anticipation of final sanction from the CC (May 5), see RTsKhlDNI, f. 554, op. 1, d. 1, 11. 83, 87-88. 94.

Sokol'nikov had cited this differentiation in his report to the Central Committee (see note above), as did Syrtsov in his April 21 report to the CC (see Perepiska, 1: 260); the Civil Administration's report #7 (covering May 1-15) repeats this point (RGVA, f. 192, op. 2, d. 197, 1. 55). 99. The order is found in Perepiska, 1: 508-509, although there it is erroneously dated April 7, its date of receipt by the CC; for the proper date, see RGVA, f. 192, op. 1, d. 66,1. 9 (IX Army order passing along Southern Front order); a copy of the document in the Hoover archive, evidently made by the Don Army from captured Soviet documents, is similarly dated April 5 (Folder "Prikazy'VBykadorov collections/Hoover Archive). 100.

In addition, the editors of the Perepiska erroneously ascribe the report to the Don Bureau, whereas it was actually titled "Syrtsov's report." Syrtsov simultaneously presented the Don Bureau's "Resolution" (registered by the CC on April 22); on its approval see RTsKhlDNI, f. 17, op. 65, d. 34, 1. 170. 103.
