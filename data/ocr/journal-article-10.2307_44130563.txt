Single editions and portfolios are listed in alphabetical order by artists or portfolio. All prints listed have been seen by a member of the PCN staff. For further information on any of the listings, it is suggested you contact your regular print dealer. Arakawa, Point Blank (1979), a series of three prints signed and numbered by the art- ist, # 1 in an edition of 25, # 2 in an edition of 28, and # 3 in an edition of 38. Each print is 31x58-1/2 in. and was printed on Rives BFK Roll by Steven Anderson at Vermillion Edi- tions in Minneapolis. The series builds on imagery established in the artist's Mechanism of Meaning , most particularly the 1975-76 etchings, The Signified or If. A complex image of three moving cylinders frames each ver- tical edge in the series, lines radiate left and right beyond each picture plane, and be- tween the cylinders are outlined three cylin- drical tubes, straight, twisted, and broken. In print §2 an Arakawa conundrum is added in peach: "Point blank/distance of focus/how anonymous is/this distance/which is texture." In #3, a particularly successful print, this legend is printed, mirrored, and shadowed; the letters framed by the twisted tube are bright colors and the others white. All visual/verbal variants suggest yet deny information, questioning what can never be known. "Heavy, heavy, heavy," says Ara- kawa. Heavy indeed. Price: $1,850 each. Published by the artist.

Each print is 41x29 in. and was printed on 550-lb. Arches water- color paper by Adam Spilka at Aeropress in New York. The print was done on the shop's new Harris press (PCN, Vol. X, p. 17), a press so large that the plate mark is not seen, allowing the artist to bleed his image, flowers in a vase on a block, on a white ground with easellike scale. In working a very old theme, Baynard achieves a new and very beautiful print. The color of two hand-painted tulips varies throughout the edition. Price: $650. Published by Multiples, Inc., New York. Jack Beai, Still Life, State II { 1978), a black and white lithograph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 60. Each print is 19x24-7/8 in. and was printed on black Arches paper at Fox Graphics in Boston. Pic- tured is a melee of fruit, tableware, and flowers on and off a table with checkered cloth, the confusion ordered by a bold exer- cise in pattern and texture in black and five to six whites. The image repeats the artist's subtly colored Still Life (1978), an edition of 75 commissioned by the Des Moines Art Center. Price: $400. Published by Brooke Alexander, Inc., New York. Billy Al Bengston, Untitled (#1-#14) (1978), a series of 14 unique handmade pa- perworks, some with collage. Size, shape, and process vary but all were made by the artist working with Garner Tullis at the Insti- tute of Experimental Printmaking in San Francisco. Each features the Bengston iris in various numbers and guise, cut or collaged, often framed by a square or a circle, linked by arcing lines. Color is brilliantly, prettily profuse, the pulp dyed, often in marbleized pattern. Bengston 's rhythms seem to work with a more marvelous poetry than ever be- fore - joy without guilt - now that the East- ern art establishment accepts decoration. Price: $500-$l,500 each. Published by the Institute of Experimental Printmaking, San Francisco. Available in Boston at Thomas Segal Gallery. Davis Carroll, The Mustard Tin (1978), an eight-color lithograph with hand-coloring signed and numbered by the artist in an edi- tion of 250. Each print is 30x22-1/2 in. and was printed on Rives BFK paper at Paul M. Maguire, Inc., in Boston. The print com- bines Carroll's rendering of an old mustard tin he photographed at a De Cordova exhibi- tion of Americana with the flowers for which he is known. Half of the edition was printed with a mauve ground and half with brown. The mauve is too sweet, but the brown is pleasantly nostalgic. Price: $250. Published byJ.A.R. Publications, Riviera Beach, Flor- ida. Available in Boston at the Prestige Gallery. Jim Dine, Men and Plants (1978), an etch- ing with photoengraving, soft ground, and drypoint signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 40. Each print is 27-5/8x22-1/2 in. (plate size) and 40x30 in. (paper size) and was printed on John Koller Sagittarius paper dyed gray by Mitchell Friedman in New York. The print relates to a 1975-76 drawing, presumably the same drawing that was the base for Two Figures Linked by Pre- Verbal Feelings (1976). But where the earlier two figures are linked by a Dine- sian red heart, the two in Men and Plants stand behind a bouquet of flowers, the subject of many recent Dine prints. The inking is par- ticularly lush, and the two figures project a powerful, if indefinable, love. Price: $750. Published by Pace Editions, New York. Jean Dubuffet, Site de mémoire (1979), a black and white screenprint signed and num- bered by the artist in an edition of ten with four hors commerce. Each print is 99x67-5/8 in. and was printed on sized lead white can- vas by Michel Kizlik and J. J. de Broutelles in Paris. The print relates to the artist's re- cent Théâtre de mémoire series, most specifically the black and white drawings he did for the book II y a. Screenprints of the drawings were cut, reassembled, and photographically enlarged. Space is disjointed, scale chaotic, and subjects diverse, but bold black line unifies all in overall pattern on the grand, grand scale. Dubuffet 's best print in years. Price: $12,500 framed. Published by Pace Editions, New York. Robert Ecker, Melancholia II (1978), a black and white mezzotint signed and num- bered by the artist in an edition of 50. Each print is 4x4 in. (plate size) and 10x8 in. (pa- per size) and was printed on Rives BFK pa- per at R. E. Townsend, Inc., in Boston. Price: $50. One of 16 images published bý Lakeside Studio, Lakeside, Michigan, from a series of 50 mezzotints, Melancholia II pic- tures a Jupiter's square, an allusion not only to Dürer but to Ecker' s own interest in the occult. Those in the series not editioned have been printed, ten artist's proofs each, by the artist in Boulder. Each begins with the artist's photograph, his subject made to seem ominous through mezzotint, whether every- day objects placed in square compositions or more obvious references to Eastern mysti- cism Western-style, such as Wu Wei , another magic square, from the Book of the Tao. Price: $50. Published by the artist, 2485 Juniper Avenue, Boulder. Steve Gianakos, Connect the Zits (1979), a black and white lithograph signed and ntimbered by the artist in an edition of 20. Each print is 19x15 in. and was printed on Rives BFK paper by Judith Solodkin at Solo Press in New York. Art teenage-style - and a tickle. Price: $150. Published by 724 Prints, New York. Richard Haas, Garden Court (1979), a screenprint signed and numbered by the art- ist in an edition of 200 with 20 artist's proofs. Each print is 96x72 in. and was printed on 100% rag Dove paper at Chromacomp in New York. Richard Haas is justly noted for his trompe l'oeil murals, whether designed for the side of a SoHo building or the walls of Brooke Alexander's gallery. Haas might seem a natural choice for Summa Artwork' s new program of wall-size screenprints. But his Garden Court , not designed to reillusion a specific space but to prettify any, recalls too many roadside restaurants. Wallpaper. Price: $2,900. Published by Summa Art- works Ltd., New York. Distributed by South Bay Designs. Ellsworth Kelly, Woodland Plant (1979), a black and white lithograph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 100. Each print is 31-1/4x48-1/2 in. and was printed on Rives BFK paper at Tyler Graphics in Bedford Village, New York. This is Kelly's most recent print of a plant - spare of line, ordered, yet sensuous. Its publication is one more reason to rejoice in the artist's exhibition Recent Paintings and Sculpture at the Metropolitan through June 24. Price: $500. Published by the Metropoli- tan Museum of Art, New York. Robert Mapplethorpe, X and Y (1978), two portfolios, each containing 13 photo- graphs signed by the artist in editions of 25 with six artist's proofs each. Each photo- graph is c. 7-3/4x7-3/4 in. and was mounted on 13- 1/2x1 3-in. rag board. The photo- graphs were taken by Mapplethorpe with a Hasselblad camera and printed and selenium Billy Al Bengston, Untitled (#8), handmade paper- work with collage and dyed pulp (18-1/2x11 in.), 1978. Courtesy Thomas Segal Gallery, Boston. 55</page><page sequence="3">Robert Ecker, Wu Wei, mezzotint (4x4 in.), 1978. Courtesy the artist. toned under his supervision in New York. The 13 A' photographs picture men, presum- ably homosexual, usually in pursuit of pleasure, whether sadistic, masochistic, or good old-fashioned exhibitionism. Some of these portraits were recently shown at the Robert Miller Gallery; others, the more ex- plicit, were not. A poem by Paul Schmidt ex- plains them as "images of our modern mar- tyrdom," "the pain of the body's struggle toward immortality, the terror of the body's rage against death," midst other purple pas- sages. More impressive than the too chic, too flaccid imagery is Mapplethorpe's profes- sional cool. The 13 Y photographs are por- traits of flowers, nary a bee in sight. This portfolio's poem is by Patti Smith. She too considers them symbols of suffering, "each a victim of seductive powers that lead to ulti- mate sacrifice." But as photographed by Mapplethorpe, they are aggressive, anthro- pomorphic, androgynous. In a year of art- world flowers, Mapplethorpe's easily hold their ground. The X portfolio is cased in black and the Y in gray. Several individual photographs are also available in editions of ten in 14xl4-in. format, as well as single, lar- ger images, often idiosyncratically framed. Portfolio price: $1,500 each. Co-published by Harry Lunn, Washington, D.C., Robert Miller, New York, and Robert Self, London. Available in New York at the Robert Miller Gallery. Ann McCoy, Sea Serpents: Tractatus Aristo- teles (1978), a lithograph in three parts signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 50, of which she has hand-colored 30. Each part is 29-3/4x41-3/4 in. and was printed blue black on Arches Roll paper by Maurice Sanchez in New York. "I became interested in the symbolism of the serpent because it ap- peared so often in my dreams, and because of the role of the serpent and its submergence in the black sandy sea of alchemical litera- ture," writes McCoy, and the serpent takes precedence in this particular work in her Night Sea series, which again draws on scien- tific photographs, literary metaphors, and her own unconscious for reference. But as multiple and explicit as her sources appar- ently are, McCoy performs her own personal alchemy, creating an unforgettable triptych. It is unusually effective with hand-coloring, but just as elegant without. Price: $1,500; hand-colored $1,800. Published by Brooke Alexander, Inc., New York. Serpens: State II (1979), an offset color litho- graph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 90. Each print is 21x29-1/2 in. and was printed on Somerset paper at Siena Studios in New York. The design was com- posed with the catalogue cover of the artist's recent exhibition at the Arts Club of Chicago in mind (see p. 57). Rendered with dramatic detail are sea serpents and chimera undeni- ably real, tails and other ephemera escaping the rectangular limits set for the cover. Though not as delicate as her hand-coloring, the color lithograph, drawn directly on plates, is most welcome. Price: $125. Pub- lished by Brooke Alexander, Inc., New York. Friedrich Meckseper, Patricks Haus (1978), a mezzotint with aquatint signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 100. Each print is 19x23-1/2 in. and was printed on Rives BFK paper by Kurt Schönen in Wortswede, Germany. More Patrick's print than Patrick's house - for publisher Patrick Cramer lives in a typical Geneva apartment building - Patricks Haus combines a small house with cypress, snail, ball, and survey pole. This complex packs into a pointed im- age, the shaped plate set needle-thin within a wide sheet. Interesting. Price: 550 SFr (c. $360). Published by Editions Patrick Cra- mer, Geneva. Available from Gemart, Knoxville, Tennessee. Robert Motherwell, Red Open with White Stripe (1979), an aquatint with soft-ground etching signed and numbered in an edition of 58. Each print is 18-1/4x35-1/2 in. and was printed on French handmade paper with the artist's watermark by Catherine Mousley at the artist's studio in Greenwich. The print's ground is a luxuriant red. At upper right, lined in black is a Motherwell open-U. At left a narrow strip of paper is left unprinted, forming a white stripe that highlights the red ground. This is the first such stripe for Moth- erwell. Price: $1,200. Untitled (1978), a lithograph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 24. Each print is 29x25-1/2 in. and was printed on Kitikata paper chine collé on Arches by Robert Bigelow at the artist's studio in Greenwich. This is one of the most satisfying of Motherwell's many recent chine collé prints, its image calligraphic but its process suggestive of collage. Price: $900. Co-pub- lished by Robert Motherwell Editions, Greenwich, and Brooke Alexander, Inc., New York, where recent Motherwell prints will be on view in May. Claes Oldenburg, Crusoe Umbrella (1979), a color aquatint with collage and spit bite signed and numbered by the artist in an edi- tion of 40 with 13 artist's proofs. Each print is 10-1/2x13-1/4 in. (plate size) and 19x23 in. (paper size) and was printed by Pat Branstead at Aeropress in New York, half the edition on Twinrocker paper and half on Lexington Weybridge. An open red umbrella is cast adrift on a green island collage à la Oldenburg - a prosaic object made to seem monumental, its structure soft yet skeletal. The anthropomorphic allusions are many, and surely it will join the Oldenburg family of icons. Already meant for a monument in Des Moines, it makes a delightful print. Price: $650. Published by Multiples, Inc., New York. Elizabeth Osborne, Manchester (1979), a pochoir signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 100. Each print is 30x22-1/2 in. and was printed on Arches 330-lb. Coldpress by Ronni Henning in New York. Acrylic was poured through 17 hand-cut stencils so that color defines the lateral roll of New Hamp- shire hills. Pleasant enough. Price: $275. Co- published by Orion Editions, New York, and Marian Locks Gallery, Philadelphia. Robert Rauschenberg and Andrei Voz- nesensky, Darkness Mother, Echo When , From a Diary , Long Island Beach , Picture Gallery , Sea- gull- Bikini of God (1978), a series of six litho- graphs signed and dated by Rauschenberg and signed and numbered by Voznesensky in varying editions. Darkness Mother is an edi- tion of 42; Echo When , 41; Long Island Beach , 39; Picture Gallery , 40; Seagull- Bikini of God , 40. Each print is c. 31x23 in. and was printed on cream Umbria paper at Universal Limit- ed Art Editions in West Islip. See page 37. Prices on request. Published by Universal Limited Art Editions, West Islip. On view at Castelli Uptown, New York, to May 19. Donald Saff, Fables (1979), a series of 29 etchings signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 50 with ten artist's proofs. Each print is 24x19 in. and was proofed by Steve Gianakos, Connect the Zits, lithograph (19x15 in.), 1979. Courtesy 724 Prints, New York. 56</page><page sequence="4">Deli Sacilotto and editioned on Fabriano Rosaspina paper by Sally Sturman in New York. A series of spoofs only distantly related to anyone's fables, including Aesop's. Saff makes his intentions obvious with such titles as The Wolf Who Cried " Seagull " and The Fish Who Knew Too Much , hoping other issues will surface, particularly his use of a vocabulary of objects to suggest a varied syntax of rela- tionships. These are tax-shelter prints and a happy example of an artist's taking advan- tage of such funding to do work he has al- ways wanted to do. The hand-coloring is done with some help from others but follows the same pastel palette. Price: $350 each. Published privately. Distributed by Get- ler/Pall, New York. Steven Sorman, An Explanation of This (1979), a hand-painted lithograph with col- lage and pencil signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 25. Each print is 40-1/8x31 in. and was printed at Vermillion Editions in Minneapolis. Sorman achieves an extravagant effect with economic means and a complex form through singular logic. An Explanation of This follows a step-by-step plan, beginning with a sheet of Japan paper lithographed in indigo. This sheet is then col- laged onto Chine paper so that it shifts to the right to form two steps. A vertical swath of Japan ultramarine blue, "a real sign-paint- er's paint," is brushed on the upper right and lower left vertical edge. Bronze leaf is applied at lower left, a square step cut out and collaged at lower right. Two lines in col- ored pencil are also added by hand. Each step in the sequence is decided experientially, with even paper tested much like a color run. Sorman describes his as the "lumpen prole- tariat" approach to printmaking, for any- thing more simply done by hand, he'll do. Lumpen? Lavishly effective. Price: $350. Published by the artist, Minneapolis. Avail- able in New York at Kathryn Markel Fine Arts. Peter Voulkos, Untitled 01 -#12) (1978), a series of 12 monotypes signed by the artist. Each print is c. 29-1/2x24-1/2 in. and was printed on handmade Ann Tullis paper by the artist working with Garner Tullis at the Institute of Experimental Printmaking in San Francisco. These are Voulkos' first prints since coming of age as an artist and his very first monoprints. For him they recall his past as a painter more than his present sculp- ture, for he works directly with clay or metal and never sketches. Nonetheless, each mono- print dramatically conveys the downpour of a Voulkos vessel. Price: $1,200 each. Pub- lished by the Institute of Experimental Print- making, San Francisco. Available in Boston at Thomas Segal Gallery.</page></plain_text>
