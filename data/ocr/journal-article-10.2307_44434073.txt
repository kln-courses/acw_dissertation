<plain_text><page sequence="1">I The meeting at which a technical paper is given is often a characteristic that helps locate desired information at a later date. Since most of the technical literature of the society is given at one of the formal national meetings and conferences, a chronological listing of the technical con- tents of these meetings can be an aid in information retrieval. In the following section such meeting programs are reported. Papers presented at Section Meetings pub- lished by the Society are also listed.
