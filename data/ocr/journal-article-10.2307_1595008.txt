<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW SOURCES FOR THE HISTORY OF MUHAMMADAN THEOLOGY (1) Since the translation of Shahrastani's work on the sects of Islam by Haarbriicker, which appeared a hundred years ago in 1850-51, European studies on Muhammadan theology have led to an imposing series of editions, translations and historical enquiries, and the general outlines of the picture which emerges from them can be taken as definitely established. At the same time, there are important gaps in this general picture, gaps not apparent perhaps at first, but which reveal themselves to anyone who tries to go more deeply into these matters. To fill these lacunae, it is necessary either to discover new sources, or to draw new information from the sources already known. It is this that the late Professor Wensinck did, in his masterly volume on the development of The Muslim Creed (2). All students of Islam were familiar with the ((tradi- tions ), ahddlth, concerning dogma, but it was Wensinck who first fully realized their importance, interpreted them closely and searchingly, and so arrived at a view, as new as it was convincing, of the development of dogma during the first cen- tury of the hegira. Wensinck was also the first to make a pene- trating analysis of the 'aqd'id, the articles of Muslim faith, which he found partly in manuscripts and partly in printed editions. It is truly astonishing that no-one before him should have thought of referring, consistently and on principle, to (1) This paper contains the essence of a lecture, given in French at the University of Brussels on the 11th December 1951. (2) Cambridge, 1932.</page><page sequence="2">J. SCHACHT these first-hand documents on the development of Muhamma- dan dogma. By this single stroke of genius Wensinck succeeded in giving its rightful place, side by side with the subject of spe- culative theology in Islam, to the other no less important subject of the faith as it lives in the hearts of its believers. This is indeed an excellent example of the happy results which are still to be attained in the field of Muhammadan theology. In this paper, then, I should like to set out some of the great historical problems of ancient Muhammadan theology and to try to regard them from a more accurate point of view, sugges- ted by new sources, sources largely in manuscript and preser- ved in English libraries, but in any case, sources whose bearing on these problems has not perhaps been clearly recognized up to now. The principal new sources are as follows. There is first of all the Kitab al-Luma' of al-Ash'ari, in a manuscript of the British Museum (1), a succinct work which nevertheless, in conjunction with his well-known Kitab al-Ibdna, permits us to discover the method of reasoning and the sources of the thought of the eponym of one of the two great schools of (( orthodox)) Muham- madan theology. Secondly, there is the Kitdb al-Tauhid of Maturidi, in a manuscript at Cambridge, a detailed work of the highest importance for two reasons : (a) it is the first text to become available from the pen of the eponym of the second great school of (( orthodox ) Muhammadan theology, which has been curiously neglected by specialists up to now; and (b) it is an extremely rich mine of information on all aspects of the pre- vious development of theology; I shall speak ot it in more detail at the end of this paper. Thirdly, there are a series of works which represent the popular Murji'ite-Hanafi tendency, a tendency much earlier than the MaturIdite school and which has never become fused with it. To these works belong three treatises on dogma originating from the circle of Abiu Hanifa: the Kitdb al-'Alim wal-Muta'allim, the Fiqh al-Absat, and, (1) It is a modern copy, made for von Kremer. Cf. Spitta, Zur Geschichte, etc., Leip- zig, 1876, 82 f. My former student, Father R. J. McCarthy, S. J., of Baghdad, has recent- ly discovered the lost original in the library of the American University of Beyrouth. 24</page><page sequence="3">THE HISTORY OF MUHAMMADAN THEOLOGY written by Abi Hanifa himself, a letter addressed to 'Uthman al-Batti. These treatises, preserved in a Cairo manuscript, have been printed in a booklet which is rare enough outside Egypt (1). Long extracts from a commentary on the Kitab al- 'Alim wal-Muta'allim exist in a manuscript at Cambridge. In the post-Maturidi period, the same tendency is represented by the Sawad al-A'zam of Hakim al-Samarqandi and by the 'aqlda, the articles of faith, of Abul-Laith al-Samarqandi, both of them authors belonging to the fourth century of the hegira. The Sawad al-A'zam has been printed a number of times in the Orient and in Russia from the last century on, but the 'aqTda of Abul-Laith, although it is among the great cate- chisms of Indonesian and Malayan Islam, exists only, unless there are local publications of which I am ignorant, in manus- cripts, several of which can be found in the library of the former India Office in London. Finally, and though I shall not refer to it again in this paper it is worth mentioning in passing, in order to show the wealth of manuscript material which remains to be explored, there exists in another manuscript of the same libra- ry a collection of the theological opinions of Shafi', made to wards the middle of the fifth century of the hegira, and of which a large part is clearly authentic. We know that Shafi' was no specialist in theology and he has contributed nothing, to my knowledge, to the development of Muhammadan dogma; but for that very reason, his opinions form an excellent point of reference. Here, then, are some of the new sources which I have had the good fortune to discover close at hand, and which make me hopeful that other students in other places will add to the mate- rial available. I should next like to consider some of the more important historical problems of Muhammadan theology in the light of the new solutions suggested to me by the analysis of these sources and, more generally, by my recent work on Islamic law and dogma.

There is no doubt that from the time of the first century of the hegira, Christian theology influenced it strongly. It exercised this influence by way of polemics and led to a similarity of problems and method rather than to a similarity of solutions. On the other hand, and a little later, there was a reception of Greek philosophical ideas in Islam. The results of my research in Muhammadan law may perhaps help to clarify a little the character and circumstances of these borrowings. I have shown the presence of concepts and legal maxims of Greco-Roman provenance, including fundamental ideas of juridical method. But these ideas are all of the type of generally admitted notions, known not only to specialists but to everyone who had had the advantage of a liberal education, that is to say an education in Hellenistic rhetoric normal to all the hellenised countries of the Near East (1). It must not be forgotten that the majority of the new converts to Islam among the inhabitants of the conquered countries, during the first two centuries of the hegira, belonged to the higher social classes. We must distinguish between the process of arabi- cizing and that of islamicizing. The process of arabicizing, W. Marqais has shown it for North Africa (2), at an early date touched the common people in the neighbourhood of the Arab military camps or towns, the peasants who came to town with their produce, the artisans and traders. We know that they, as a rule, became islamicized only at a much later date. The higher social groups, the educated classes, on the other hand, started to become Muslims at the same time as they learnt to speak Arabic, and both movements began early. It is obvious that people belonging to these classes, in the first and at the beginning of the second century of the hegira, had much more powerful material and moral incentives to changing their reli- gion, or at least to bringing their children up in the religion of the new ruling class, than simple peasants and arti- (1) See my paper Foreign Elements in Ancient Islamic Law, in Journal of Comparative Legislation, 1950, Nos. 3-4, 9 ff.

We find in fact among the mawdll, non- Arabs converted to Islam in the Umaiyad period, of whose circumstances we have knowledge, many educated persons who had their roots in Hellenistic civilisation. (I am not speaking here of the equally important group of descendants of prisoners of war, whom their Arab masters had educated and then freed.) These educated converts and their children were the agents by whom ideas which were part of their intellectual equipment, insensibly entered the conscience of the Muslims. This mode of transmission, popular and not specialist, explains the fact that, in the field of law, we hardly ever find the same technical conclusions on both sides (and if this is the case, it is purely accidental), but only a resemblance in the main lines of thought, a borrowing of principle and not of detail. It seems to me that the same explanation is demanded by the existence in Muhammadan theology of ideas based on Greek philosophy. These ideas are not the technical concepts of philosophers, but second-hand notions deriving from popular philosophy. The Muslims of the first century, one might say, appropriated worn- out intellectual coins which came to them only after long usage, their salient features almost effaced, without really knowing how to use them (1). This explains the over-simplified and, as it were, rudimentary character of many philosophical ideas in Muhammadan theology (a judgment made by the true Muhammadan philosophers themselves on the theologians), it explains equally the curious anomaly of the co-existence among the ancient theologians of Islam of technical terms essentially abstract with a method of reasoning essentially concrete and hostile to abstraction. As an example, let us take the idea of the body. According to the Shiite theologian Hisham b. al-Hakam, who died about the year 200 of the hegira, all that exists is a body (2), ( body ) and ? thing ) are interchangeable, therefore God (1) I am glad to find myself in agreement with S. van den Bergh on this point; see his lecture Ghazali and Averroes, given at the Warburg Institute in the University of London on the 16th January, 1952. (2) This proposition is Stoic. 27</page><page sequence="6">must be a body. Not only substances but also accidents are bodies. At the same time, he defines a body as a thing possessing three dimensions. Starting from these premises, Hisham says: (( God is a circumscribed body, which has length breadth and thickness, and His dimensions are alike; He is a radiant light ; He has a definite size in His three dimensions and He does not exceed that size ; He is in a certain place and not in another; He is like a bar of pure metal, He shines on all sides like a round pearl ; He has colour, taste, scent and touch, in the sense that His colour is His taste, His scent and His touch; He is himself colour, that colour being no other than Himself; He moves or stops, rises or sits down ) (1). This certainly is an extreme example, but a significant one. The passage is by no means an thropomorphic, but reveals rather a kind of (( abstract materialism ), a type of thought essentially concrete which has at its disposal only second-hand ideas for tools, ideas separated from their historical context and used without regard for their true function. We find the same ((abstract materialism ) in the theologian Muhammad b. Karram, who died in 255 A.H. According to him, God is a substance, He is limited and circumscribed from below, in the direction where He touches His throne (2). It is a far cry from the thought of Hisham typical of the specula- tive theolo gy of the Muslims in the second century of the hegira, to that of St. John of Damascus, his predecessor by three quarters of a century. Here lies the whole difference between the technical and the popular transmission of an idea, and this last mode of transmission, which is the same in both Muham- madan theology and religious law, explains the character of the thought. Muhamadan theology had to travel far before it arrived at formulas which could satisfy the religious sentiment of the majority of the believers. It is interesting to observe how the two layers, the popular and the learned, are superimposed upon each other, and how theological ideas of Greek origin acquired a Koranic founda- (1) Ash'ari, Maqaldt al-Isldmigyn, ed.

The theological school of the Mu'tazila had adopted the concept of ( suitable ) or (( fitting ) (aslah), a concept derived from popular Hellenistic thought. This was soon to become naturalized into Islam under the aegis of Koranic references to divine wisdom and providence. Somewhat later, only towards the middle of the third century of the hegira, Galen's De Usu Partium, in which he seeks to establish the usefulness of all the organs and to prove by t eleological argument the wisdom and goodness of the Creator, was translated into Arabic. This book, agreeing as it did with ideas already existing in Islam, was much appreciated and from that time on, the learned Greek concept and the popular Graeco-Muhammadan one, become undistinguishable from each other (1). The second problem that I should like to consider is that of man's responsibility for his acts. This problem is (as is well known) summed up by the term iktisab, a term by which the Muhammadan theologians tried to harmonize the two ideas of divine action and human responsibility. To God belongs the production, the (( creation ) of the acts currently attributed to man, while to man belongs only the iklisab. This is the solution adopted by the Traditionalists (ahl al-haddth) and the orthodox in general, while the Qadarites and the Mu'tazila attributed to man himself the (( creation , of his acts. This term iklisdb has been commonly interpreted in Europe and sometimes even in the Orient as acquisition or appropriation, a definition based on the elementary and banal meaning of the Arabic root. This meaning exists, undoubtedly, and is the ordinary sense, even in theology, when it is a question of acquiring the means of existence (rizq) assigned to each individual by divine decree (2). But as for human acts, an assumed acquisition on the part of man of the act in truth ((created ) by God, does not solve the theologian's problem. More than one occidental author has commented on this fact, but only Nallino, in 1933, saw that (1) I use a popular ) of ideas transmitted in the non-technical way I have described, although I am well aware of the fact that the Mu'tazilite movement scarcely affected the mass of the Muslim people. (2) Cf. the title of Shaibani's treatise K. al-Iktisdb fil-Rizq al-Mustatfb. 29</page><page sequence="8">J. SCHACHT the term is derived from the Koran, where two forms of the verb in question, kasab and iktasab, are often found (1). As to the interpretation, Nallino proposed to follow the commen- tators of the Koran, who give these verbs almost always the sense of 'amil, to act. But to adopt the vague and dry inter- pretation of the commentaries would only be a last resource, and I think that to arrive at the true meaning of the term, one must on one side extract as nearly as possible the full mea- ning from the Koranic passages, and, on the other, connect them with the most ancient period of Muhammadan theology, when the problem of man's responsibility for his acts was envisaged for the first time. This period is typically represented by the epistle of Hasan al-Basri, a qadarite document belonging to the very earliest years of the second century of the hegira (2). In this, IHasan distinguishes two sorts of human acts or condi- tions, voluntary and involuntary (3), and says that man has responsibility only for his voluntary acts. Indeed, the theo- logians only concerned themselves with these last in their dis- cussions concerning iktisdb. It is necessary then to look for a narrower and more restricted meaning of the two Koranic verbs, and it seems to me that this meaning is no other than the commercial term ( to engage, to pledge, one's credit )). Torrey was right to count these verbs among The Commercial-Theological Terms in the Koran (4); he discusses them in detail but does not give them any common and consis- tent meaning (if one excepts the elementary sense of the word which means ((to acquire, to collect property ))). I think then that the meaning ( to engage, to pledge one's credit ), ((to be held responsible ), either from the commercial and financial or from the religious and moral point of view, satisfies all the requirements both of the Koranic passages and of the theologians' definitions from Hasan al-Basri on. There is, for instance, sura LII, 21: ( Each man, according to the degree (1) Raccolta di Scritti, II, Rome 1940, 28 f., 429 f. (2) Ed. Ritter, in Der Islam, XXI, 1933, 138 ff. Cf. Obermann, in Journal of The Ame- rican Oriental Society, LV, 1935, 138 ff. (3) This distinction follows the example of Greek popular philosophy (van den Bergh). (4) Leiden, 1892, 27 ff. 30</page><page sequence="9">THE HISTORY OF MUHAMMADAN THEOLOGY in which he has pledged his credit, shall stand security for it ,, kullu-mri'in bimd kasaba rahirt-a Meccan passage which brings out clearly the commercial connotation of the term. I even think that, originally, the form kasab meant ((to be cre- dited ), and the form iktasab ((to be debited ), as in sura II, 286 : ((God imposes on each person only that of which he is capable : to his credit that which has been credited to him, and to his debit that which has been debited to him ), lahd ma kasabat wa-'alaiha ma-ktasabat. In the majority of the Kora- nic passages one can observe this distinction, but there are others in which it is not made (as in sura LII, 21, just quoted), and poetical usage shows also that the two verbal forms were often used without distinction at the time of the Prophet (1). Abu Hanifa interpreted the two terms in the same way; the Kitab al-'Alim wal-Muta'allim makes him say : ((We know that God counts to man's credit (yahsub lahu) the duties which he fulfils towards Him, and writes down to his debit (yaktub 'alaih) his sins.... He counts to his credit his good deeds, and writes down to his debit his evil deeds; therefore God says laha ma kasabat, meaning the good, and 'alaiha ma-ktasabat, meaning the bad ) (2). This interpretation of the term iktisdb that I suggest, is the only one which agrees perfectly with the context of numerous passages in the sources to which I referred earlier, as I shall show by quoting one or two. We read in the Fiqh al-Absat: ( If we ask of someone who has been struck down by a misfor- tune : Is it a trial which comes to you from God, or are you yourself responsible for it, to blame for it (au hiya mimma- ktasabt) ?, and if he replies : This is not a trial which comes to me from God, does he become an unbeliever because of this ? ) (3). The reply is of no interest in this context, but the meaning to be given to the term iktisdb comes out clearly in the question. This text dates from round about the year 150 (1) E. g. MufaddallTyt, ed. and transl. Lyall, LXXXIX, 18 (by jHarith b. Zalim): lam aksib athdma, , I never incurred the guilt of any erime . (2) Fol. 20 r of the Damascus manuscript. (3) P. 42 of the Cairo edition. 31</page><page sequence="10">J. SCHACHT of the hegira. Here is another example, from the beginning of the fourth century, taken from the Kitab al-Tauhtd of Maturidi. One of the characteristic differences between the two theological schools of the Ash'arites and the Maturidites, resides precisely in the terminology which they employ when they describe the part of a man's acts which properly belongs to him. The Ash'arites say simply that it is the iktisab, that is to say that he is considered to be responsible for them. The Maturidites, going farther, declare that it is his choice or approval, the ikhtiyar. Maturidi, in setting out his opinion, says :( Each person knows by a sort of intimate persuasion that he chooses to do what he does and that he is a responsible agent (fd'il kdsib) )). This would not make sense if kdsib were only a mere synonym of fa'il. Ash'ari, a contemporary of Maturidi, distinguishes in his Kitdb al-Luma' between voluntary and involuntary movements (harakat iktisab and harakat idlirdr, or kasb and dariira), the same distinction which exists, although without the technical terms, in Hasan al-Basri. On the other hand, Ash'ari takes the term for granted as part of the ordinary equip- ment of theologians who use it, e ach in his own way, in his own system of thought, and he wonders what its correct meaning can be (1). By his time, the term had acquired various shades of meaning among different authors, and Ash'ari cites, among other opinions, that of Jubba'i, a Mu'tazilite theologian of the preceding generation. Jubba'i, while admitting the ortho- dox ) definition of the term iktisdb in the sense of being credited or debited, recalls, as if in extenuation, that the word in its ordinary sense means the acquisition of already existing pro- perty; in the same manner, he implies, a man can acquire the responsibility for his acts. Here lies the origin of the inter- pretation of the term as acquisition, appropriation, which we find from time to time in later authors, such as Ibn Qaiyim al-Jauziya (2). But towards the end of the fifth century of (1) Maqaldt, 539-542.

The third problem which I should like to discuss is that of the precedents of the Ash'arite school of theology. The usual opinion is more or less as follows : Ash'ari first of all followed the doctrine of the Mu'tazila, then he became conver- ted to traditionalism, but continued to use the speculative me- thod of the Mu'tazila to defend traditionalist doctrine; in this way he arrived at an intermediate position, and this posi- tion was maintained by his school. But Goldziher had already remarked that Ash'ari showed himself an intransigent Tradi- tionalist, hostile to all idea of mediation. Wensinck re-exa- mined the question of the exact relation between Ash'ari and the Ash'arite school and arrived at a non liquet, while underli- ning our need of new sources in order to settle the problem (2). I think that the sources to which I have referred will help us to resolve this question. Ash'ari, in many parts of his Kitdb al-Luma', alludes to his companions (ashab), and sometimes he refers to differences of opinion existing among them, or between them and himself; they are not then purely and simply his disciples. The same work shows clearly that his reasoning is the outcome of long discussions between the two parties, the true Mu'tazila on one side, and their adversaries on the other; his propositions and arguments, therefore, cannot be regarded as the result of his personal speculation. It appears that the forerunners of Ash'ari were a kind of ( orthodox Mu'tazila ), that is to say, men who employed a speculative method of reasoning, while sharing many of the opinions of the Traditionalists. Indeed, I had noticed in my studies on Muhammadan law, without thinking of any possible link with the development of dogma, that one group of Mu'tazilites, during the third century of the hegira, fell under the influence of the Traditionalists. Khaiyat, (1) Cf. Brunschvig, in Revue Internationale des Droits de l'Antiquite, II, 1949, 171.

SCHACHT a Mu'tazilite of Baghdad who died about the year 300, author of the well-known Kitab al-Intisar, a polemical work against the renegade Ibn al-Rewendi, represents this school of thought. Khaiyat, it is true, had not yet abandoned the major positive doctrines of the Mu'tazila, for example he still believed that the Koran was a created thing, but he had already abandoned many of their essential doctrinal premises, and in order to defend the earlier Mu'tazilites, the best he could do was to pretend that the opinions in question had been falsely attributed to them. The ((orthodox Mu'tazila ), if I am not mistaken, must have been the forerunners and even the true founders of that scholastic school of theology which we know as the Ash- 'arite school. Ash'ari himself counts for little in this; he was chosen as the eponym at a later date, when the school needed -omeone of recognized orthodoxy in order to repel the attacks of the extreme Traditionalists. And what better name could they find than that of a good Traditionalist who had himself admitted the legitimacy of reasoning in theology ? Indeed, it is often the doctrine of the Ash'arite school, but hardly the doctrine of Ash'ari himself, which may be considered a borderline variant of the not always uniform teaching of the Mu'tazila. The method of tanzih ((abstraction ), which the Ash'arites used in interpreting the anthropomorphisms of the Koran, is basically no more than a variant of the method of interpre- tation by metaphor which the Mu'tazila employed; Ash'ari himself rejects this expedient and supports the literal interpre- tation preferred by the Traditionalists, adding sometimes the formula of the balkafa, a formula which was meant to exclude all further reasonning. (It may be said in parenthesis that Shafi' 's usage proves plainly that the balkafa is primarily directed against reasoning, and not against the excesses of crude anthropomorphism, as has been supposed up to now.) This view of Ash'ari's place between his forerunners on one side and his retrospective disciples on the other does not allow of much importance being given to the well-known anecdote concerning his startling conversion from the school of the Mu'tazila to traditionalism. I must confess that I have doubts 34</page><page sequence="13">THE HISTORY OF MUHAMMADAN THEOLOGY about the fact itself, not to mention the miraculous details. The episode is only to be found in late biographies, later by several centuries than the event with which they deal. The works of Ash'ari, which properly should be consulted in prefe- rence, reveal no sign of such a conversion. It would perhaps not be out of place to mention that-Shafi'i was the author of a veritable revolution in Muhammadan religious science com- parable to that commonly attributed to Ash'ari, no less inclined to polemics than the other, and ShafiTs works contain nume- rous traces of his earlier convictions, which nevertheless he took great pains to combat and efface. All that Ash'ari's books allow us to see, is a Traditionalist with an inclination towards reasoning, who often affirms that his views are identical with those of the imam Ibn Hanbal and of the Traditionalists in general, and it is easily possible that the aim of these protes- tations was not to atone for a Mu'tazilite past but to make acceptable to the Traditionalists his speculative method. This would agree very well with his being adopted as eponym by the so-called Ash'arite scholl of theology. If he was converted, it was not a conversion from true Mu'tazilism, but from ( orthodox Mu'tazilism ) to traditionalism. Whatever may have been the case, the existence of a group of ((orthodox Mu'tazilites ) is apparent not only from the contents of Ash'arI's Kitab al-Luma', but also from the discus- sions which form part of Maturdi's Kitdb al-Tauhld. We meet here again the same group of forerunners who were the first to elaborate the postulates of ((orthodox ) speculative theology in Islam; we observe that they had been attacked by the true Mu'tazila, who themselves, at the time concerned, had come to a certain degree under the influence of the traditionalist tenets. The Kitdb al-Tauhid shows also that MaturidI' s reasoning is nearer to that of the Mu'tazila than Ash'ari's, in the sense that even the method of tanzrh, attributed to Ash'ari by the mem- bers of the Ash'arite school, is not used by him but by Matu- ridi. This also proves that Ash'ari was not the principal agent 35</page><page sequence="14">J. SCHACHT in the transition from Mu'tazilism towards ( orthodox)) specu- lative theology (1). The fourth point which I have chosen to discuss is less a problem than a little discovery, the discovery of a current in Muslim theology which has remained unknown up to now. Asking myself what Muhammadan ((orthodoxy)) really meant, I found the answer to be : obviously, the doctrine followed by the majority of Muslims. In the fourth century of the hegira this doctrine acquired as a facade, or if one prefers to say as a superstructure, the two related systems of the schools of the Ash'arites and of the Maturidites. These two systems suc- ceeded because they remained in close touch with the opinions and feelings of the majority, while the Mu'tazila, in the long run, failed completely because they were too remote from popular feeling and were even inclined to regard as unbelievers the ignorant and illitterate majority of those who professed Islam. This great majority of Muslims must not be identified with the Traditionalists without reservations. It is true that the Traditionalists could always count on popular sympathy, but their doctrine as it is set out in the teaching of Ibn Hanbal, for instance, is learned and not simple, conscious and not pri- mitive, extremist and not average. What proportion of tle great mass of Muslims would become enthusiastic, unless their passions were excited by other motives, over the delicate distinc- tions which would teach them whether the recitation of a verse of the Koran was created or not created ? To understand popular orthodoxy, one must turn to the popular expositions of the creed, to the little treatises written for the instruction of the people, children and illiterates, which were meant to be learned by heart and recited, such as the articles of faith of Tahawi, a contemporary of Maturidi, the Sawdd al-A'zam (signifiant title which means ((the great majority )) of Hakim al-Samarqandi, and the catechism, in the form of questions and answers, of Abul-Laith al-Samarqandi. The (1) The relation of Ash'ari's and Maturidi's forerunners with the Ahl al-ithbat remains to be determined. Cf. W. M. Watt, Free Will and Predestination in Early Islam, London 1948, 104-116. 36</page><page sequence="15">THE HISTORY OF MUHAMMADAN THEOLOGY oldest document of this series which has come to hand, is the authentic Fiqh al-Akbar(1), a production of Abui Hanifa's circle. It is only necessary to look at the contents of these works to obser- ve their popular character; they put practical problems in the forefront, eschatological features, edifying dogmas such as those concerning miracles, details of little theological importance but which would strike the popular imagination, such as the number of the prophets, apostles and sacred books revealed before Islam. These works represent a clearly defined current of theological thought. First of all, these authors and others whose names I could add, are Hanafis. One would expect then a close parallel with the doctrine of Maturidi which, it is known, was the doctrine preferred by the Hanafis. This indeed is so. Maturidi himself refers often to the opinions, whether authentic or not, of Abu Hanifa. From the time of Abui Hanifa to that of Abul-Laith, there was naturally considerable doctrinal deve- lopment, but from the moment that there arises an (( orthodox ) speculative theology, there is complete agreement between the learned system of Maturidi and his followers on one side, and the popular teaching of Tahawi and his successors on the other. Secondly, the popular Hanafi current, although different from that of the pure Traditionalists and free of their special preoc- cupations, attached like them a great importance to scriptural proofs and relegated rational proofs to a secondary place ; this comes out clearly in the expositions of Tahawi and Hakim al-Samarqandi. In general, there is a considerable family like- ness between the two doctrines, and both practise literal inter- pretation of texts. Thirdly, one of the salient ideas of the popular theology represented by this current of thought, is the notion of the community (jamd'a), united by its use of tradition (sunna). The community of Muslims is represented by their great majo- rity (the sawdd al-a'zam), which holds a fair balance between the extremes. Tahawl and Hakim al-Samarqandi invoke it solemnly, and Maturidi, on the side of the learned toheologians, often refers to it. The same idea, implicitly at least, is already (1) Called Fiqh al-Akbar I by Wensinck. 37</page><page sequence="16">J. SCHACHT at the base of the authentic Fiqh Al-Akbar. Fourthly, the current of doctrine in question is the direct continuation of the ancient Murji'a. The Murji'a, indeed, was none other than the great majority of Muslims at the time of the Umaiyad s; they kept clear of Khariji risings and of 'Abbasid propaganda, movements which menaced the unity of the community; this is why they were loyal to the government, for whatever its faults they would not pass judgment on any of those who professed Islam but resigned themselves to things as they were and accepted the decrees of divine predestination. Ash'ari in the Kitab al-Luma' confirms the identity of both movements. The main murji'ite tenets, the duty of submitting oneself to the government and the care for maintaining the unity of the community, are developed, repeated and underlined in the works to which I have referred. Abui Hanifa certainly belonged to the Murji'a. All this has again a learned parallel in Maturidi, who sets out the doctrine of the Murji'a most sympathetically and tries to show their good intentions, although in the intellectual climate of his time, he was obliged to dissociate himself from them. To the degree in which the Traditionalists represent true popular religious feeling, they come near to the Murji'a, and this explains the existence of striking parallels between the respective doctrines, as well as the sympathy expressed by a number of Hanbalis for the Umaiyad dynasty. Maturidi does not hesitate implicitly to identify the Traditionalists (whom he calls HashwTya) with the Murji'a. Our conclusion is then that the Murji'a expressed the common opinion of the great majority of Muslims at the time of the Umaiyads; this does not mean that all Muslims were Murji'ite theologians, but that he great masses maintained and supported the specialists. From this source there flowed a current of popular theological thought, a current which conti- nued to flow strongly, even after the original Murji'a had fallen finally into disfavour and become obsolete, its place as the interpreter of popular religious feeling having been taken over by traditionalism. The traching of the Traditionalists was near enough to the main ideas of the Murji'a, for Murji'ite 38</page><page sequence="17">THE HISTORY OF MUHAMMADAN THEOLOGY literary and theological tradition to continue, after some small necessary adjustments, to express the popular level of Muham- madan theology. This tradtion, at the level of the specialists, in due course found its complement in the learned doctrine of Maturidi and his school, a doctrine imbued with the specula- tive theology of its time. It is not difficult to verify the accuracy of this point of view. We know that the Traditionalists were the great adversaries of the Mu'tazila. Now if the popular background of the Murji'a was really the same as that of the Traditionalists, as I have suggested, one would expect to find the same attitude among the authors of those works inspired by the Murji'a to which I have referred. This is, indeed, so and the hostility against the Mu'tazila is very pronounced among them. The same feeling is found at the learned level in Maturidi and his followers, although their positive doctrine on many technical questions is perceptibly nearer to Mu'tazilite thougt than Ash'arite doctrine is. This divergence between doctrine and feeling found in Maturidi and his disciples would itself demand an explana- tion, and history gives it to us. Incidentally, it must not be thought that the doctrine of the Murji'a, which preaches that the religious judgment on the Muslim sinner is a matter for God alone, was necessarily a reason for tolerance in the political and social circumstances of the Umaiyad period. There remains for consideration the Hanafi character of the doctrine which has been discussed. It has sometimes been asser- ted that there is an affinity between the doctrines of the Ha- nafis and those of the school of Maturidi, as well as between the doctrines of Shafi'I's followers and those of the Ash'arites. I must admit I have been unable to discover anything of the kind. At the utmost, one might say that the Hanbali school is the natural result of the teaching of the Traditionalists. The connexion of fact which exists between the other schools of religious law and the schools of theology is rather of a perso- nal and adventitious character. Abui Hanifa was not only a specialist in religious law but took part in theological discus- sions (they are, indeed, only his theological opinions, and not 39</page><page sequence="18">J. SCHACHT his doctrines in religious law, which have come down to us textually), and he pronounced himself in favour of the Murji'a. It was natural then that the Hanafis should prefer articles of faith of Murji'ite inspiration. At the scholarly level, the school of Maturidi, who was himself a Hanafi, provided a speculative theology corresponding to these articles of faith. The Hanafis, then, were well provided for at both levels. On the other hand, neither Malik nor Sh5fi'i contributed anything memorable to theological discussion. Ash'ari himself belonged to the school of Shafi'i, whereas B5qillani, two generations after him, is claimed both by the Malikis and the Shafi'is, and that created a predilection among learned Shafi'Is for the Ash'arite school. But at the popular level, the Hanafi formulas which had alrea- dy survived the rise of traditionalism, continued to be in favour, so that the 'aqrda of Abul-Laith became a popular catechism in Indonesia and Malaya, a region which was solidly Shafi'L. As for the Malikis, I lack data until towards the end of the fourth century of the hegira (1). At this period, Ibn Abi Zaid al-Qairawani, author of the Risala, an elementary treatise of Maliki law, put an 'aqlda at the head of his work. This docu- ment, which has also never been used in studying the history of Islamic dogma, is essentially Ash'arite, but is impregnated with traditionalist feeling, comparable to that of Ash'ari him- self. Qairaw5ni's Risala had a great success and seems to have been instrumental in spreading a predilection for Ash'arite theology among Maliki scholars. But traditionalist dogmatics, with literal interpretation of anthropomorphisms, continued to prevail in the Maghreb, and it was left to the Almohade reformer Ibn Tumert, himself an enemy of the Maliki system of positive law, to introduce Ash'arite theology in that country more than a century later (2). Here then are some of the results at which I have arrived in the course of recent researches in Muhammadan theology, and I trust I have convinced my readers of the importance of the (1) Since this paper was written, I found a manuscript copy of the dogmatic treatise of Yahya b.

(2) Goldziher, Le Livre de Mohammed Ibn Toumert, Algiers 1903, 54 f. 40</page><page sequence="19">THE HISTORY OF MUHAMMADAN THEOLOGY new sources which have led me on to these results. The most important work among them is undoubtedly the Kitab al- TauhTd of Maturidi, of which I am preparing an edition, and it is perhaps worth giving some preliminary information about its contents. The whole book, which is unmistakably authentic, consists of a number of sections, each which a short religious invocation as introduction. The arrangement is systematic enough. Maturidi begins with a theory of knowledge; his work is the oldest treatise on Muhammadan theology that begins with an exposition of the subject. Then the author speaks in considerable detail of the chief subjects of theological discussion in his time, such as God, the creation of the world, good and evil, prophecy, God's wisdom and justice, man's acts and his responsibility for them, divine and hurian will, predestination, the effects of sin on the status of a Muslim, and finally, the definition of belief and unbelief. In several sections of his book, Maturidi follows, step by step, the argu- ments of two Mu'tazilites, Balkhi and Muhammad b. Shabib, and gives long quotations from their works. Balkhi, in the book that Maturidi refutes (it was perhaps his Kitdb Awd'il al-Adilla), had himself argued against the doctrines of his ad- versaries. Maturidi shows himself to be well informed about the opinions of his predecessors, whether Muslim or not, inclu- ding the Manichaeans, the Mandaeans and the Marcionites. It is this which makes his work of the highest interest in studying the history of Muhammadan theology. Amongst the most striking details of this kind must be counted long quotations from the works of two remarkable, though somewhat enigmatic men : Abu 'Isa al-Warraq (1) and Ibn al-Rewendl. For good measure, Maturidi gives us extracts from the polemics in which Ibn al-Rewendi indulged against Abi 'Isa at a period when he himself had not yet bro- ken away from Islam. It is indeed curious to find that in Matu- ridi's quotations Ibn al-Rewendi refutes the argument of Abi 'Isa who had denied the presence of angels as allies of the Mus- (1) Cf. A. Abel, Abul 'Isd al-Warrdq, privately cyclostyled, Brussels 1949. 41</page><page sequence="20">J. SCHACHT lims at the battle of Badr, but that later Ibn al-Rewendi him- self adopted the same argument in his Kitdb al-Zumurrud (quoted by Khaiyat). While talking of Ibn al-Rewendi, Matu- ridi confirms implicitly the more recent date of his death. I have already mentioned that MaturidI shows himself very hos- tile to the Mu'tazila, while at the same time being in no small degree influenced by their doctrine. One little detail is rather significant. In one of his diatribes, he blames the Mu'tazila because, he says, they are incapable of refuting heretics (mulhi- da). He himself, in various places, proves his interest in apolo- getics. But apologetics, the defence of Islam against its ene- mies, was one of the principal preoccupations of the Mu'tazila. This interest is lacking in the work of Ash'ari, and among the Ash'arites it only appears in that of Baqillani, two generations later. Maturidi, the professed enemy of the Mu'tazila, was to continue their work. Joseph SCHACHT (Oxford) 42</page></plain_text>
