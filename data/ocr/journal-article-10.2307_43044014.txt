<plain_text><page sequence="1">Three Poems by Arthur Henry King* Anthropomorphic But Not Mythical With imminent night behind, a wall of thundercloud - a vast ghost of Carrara marble apparently as hard and smooth and certainly as vacuous as Thorvaldsen, but swelling to fill an orient fifth of the twilit vault - confronts at evening's occidental cavemouth a watery afterlight blotched with sepia - the aquarellist's or calligrapher's tint for revelation or deception. At the other end of the dark, a candid cumulus by Palmer - tumescent for vague Arcadians in Shoreham's vicarious climax - and a waned Isis framing the negative of her full past look back on a band of subaqueous dawn with its tinge of Mantegna madder but barred with black. It is all a ghostly show: dark at the source ot light and bright reflected, as if the light were stronger where it rested than whence it came. * Dr. King, associate director of the Honors Program, is Professor of English at Brigham Young University. 227</page><page sequence="2">228 However - though Apollo-Polypheme with his red socket May fumble exhausted down to places west, and Phoebus reorientated and reoculate rise to provide T.V. in Plato's antre-theatre - I thank God (to say so begs the question of Pharisaical anti-Pharisaism like that of the Establishmentarian anti-Establishment or the bellicose pacifist - let alone that of Eliot's theological terminology in the Four Quartets - but what else can properly be said?) I thank God that I am as other men - sharing their prospect of salvation - and not, exempli gratia, the character taken over by World Literature when someone born of seven cities representing, perhaps, a consortium - nodded at an intellectual junk-sale; not, in short, that shady, myth-torn, god-thwarted, goddess-supported Achaian shroud of a Phoenician spirit who past fellows of a hopeless underworld eager only to sup unatoning blood, past fabulous rocks, volcanoes, islands and oxen, through winds, whirlpools, drugs and figmentary women struggled (Calypso?) unrecognized (Noman?) but for an old hound (twenty-one or more!) - struggled unrecognized, but for an old dog, home (a doubtful homer, cynics might rebark, (since cants familiari s may, according to occasion, be faithful or mordant) - home in transit to a hopeless underworld. And yet, from that inactive hopelessness, or Tennyson's indefinitely telescopic arch of experience - more accurately speaking, a tunnel of active despair ending in Dante's Atlantic hurricane -</page><page sequence="3">POEMS BY A. H. KING 229 or - more exactly still - from the sleepy lower-middle-class backwater of number seven, Eccles Street, Dublin, Christ died, and lives, to liberate Odysseus (as man self-spun to a chrysalis of "person", mummy embalmed in legend, or pupa swaddled in a maker's imagination) - if, like Lear or Hamlet, can accept Him - into his real imago. This kind may be but shadows; but for shadows there is a shadowy salvation, for spirits a spirited choice, for man a soul - spirit with body capable of shadow. We have not emerged from a mother's womb to be haunters each of his own dusk-mouthed cavern where hucksters, treacherous clerics, and pol√≠ticos manipulate our lowest common denominator on their phantasamal screen; but, whatever Galileo may covertly have muttered or that rather more steady Sir Fred Hoyle state - on grounds with no beginning, no middle, no end - about what moves about what in what, still moving about, still stays about the same, we stand restored at the moral centre - for its other planets are certainly uninhabited- at the moral centre of a solar system (its comparative position in the cosmos not being - yet - strictly our business), on a living, breathing, white and blue cloud-agate with a streak or two of cinnamon (no other planet looks remotely like it) : Earth, spinning in a noon sun towards the Millennium. And I, a solid body here in the middle - too, too solid, perhaps, in the middle, but not too much i' the son - am not, at least, a shadow: I cast one in God's image.</page><page sequence="4">230 And I shall cast it sharper still - my mettle of incorporate god - at the moment of the trumpet call to shattering reunion through the bright Millennial morning on the Resurrection Day.</page></plain_text>
