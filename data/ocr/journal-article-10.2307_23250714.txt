<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Response to Martin and Wiebe Nancy Frankenberry* WHILE I FIND all five of Luther Martin and Don Wiebe's prelimi nary assumptions unexceptional, I share neither their pessimism regard ing religious studies nor their optimism about the cognitive science approach to religion. To explain why, I would need to peel apart two things—the study of religion from a hilly naturalistic perspective, on the one hand, and the scientific or cognitive study of religion, on the other. It is clear to me that we do, in fact, have powerful and provocative work in the study of religion currently conducted from an entirely naturalistic perspective. I am thinking of recent and very different books such as Owen Flanagan's The Bodhisattva's Brain: Buddhism Naturalized (2011) or Mark Johnston's Saving God: Religion after Idolatry (2009) and Surviving Death (2010) or Wesley Wildman's Science and Religious Anthropology (2009). None of these studies is particularly dependent on the kind of research in the cognitive sciences that Luther Martin and Don Wiebe find promising for religious studies. Why do we not have an exciting research program called cognitive science of religion, and why is it delusory to hope that the study of religion can swing free of religiousness? Martin and Wiebe think that it is both because the academic study of religion remains "subservient to theology" and more especially because, as cognitive science itself shows, religion is deeply embedded in certain evolutionary defaults of human brains that generate the idea of superhuman beings. By contrast, I think that it is *Nancy Frankenberry, Department of Religion, Dartmouth College, 6036 Thornton Hall, Hanover, NH 03755, USA. E-mail: nancy.frankenberry@dartmouth.edu.

If the most important ques tions in the study of religion are semantic in nature, not causal, then the forms of explanation that make reference to human beliefs, intentions, desires, etc. will never be displaced by science, however developed that science eventually becomes. As Wilfrid Sellars put it, the "space of reasons" and the "space of causes" are not commensurable. Martin and Wiebe find irony in the fact that the cognitive sciences predict that religion and religiousness will persist because, in Robert McCauley's nomic phrase, "religion is natural and science is not," and so, they conclude, the academic study of religion will continue to be constrained by religiousness. But this does not follow. All that follows if "religion is natural and science is not" is that (some) people will con tinue to be naturally religious, or naturally vulnerable to religion, not that (other) people cannot inquire scientifically or naturalistically into the beliefs and practices that constitute religions. The question is whether this inquiry yields a fruitful research program for the study of religion. Martin and Wiebe are still enthusiastic about the prospects in cognitive science, but I would register several cautions. At first glance, the idea that domain-specific modules and inference systems in the brain can explain the existence and persistence of cul tural representations like religion seems new and intriguing. The work of Boyer, Pyysiainen, Atran, and Barrett, and earlier, of Guthrie, Sperber, and McCauley-Larson, presents an abundance of empirical evi dence about the workings of the human mind. I certainly think that it is a useful picture to think of the mind as a network of integrated modules designed for solving various evolutionary problems. And it makes sense that a certain balance between intuitive and counter intuitive representations contributes to the mimetic value and hence the transmissibility of religious ideas. But transmissibility along causal path ways is still premised on the idea that the job of "science of religion" consists in offering explanations at the causal level. The trouble with this is that mental phenomena resist being captured in the nomological net of physical theory. Here I have been convinced by Donald Davidson's argument that there are no strict deterministic laws on the basis of which mental events can be predicted and explained. We can reject all deterministic, nonnormative laws connecting either mental states with physical states or mental states with other mental states. In the absence of any such thing as an underlying mental reality whose laws we can study, all we have are the normative and holistic perspec tives of interpretation.</page><page sequence="3">600 Journal of the American Academy of Religion It is important to keep in mind that the cognitive theory of religion is underpinned by evolutionary biology. We know that the causal pro cesses that produce new designs in the evolution of life are largely random with respect to any functions that those novelties might assume. Therefore, linking religion to the level of biology does not tell us very much about "universal" cognitive proclivities and defaults to see agent causality at work. I doubt that we even need the biological under pinnings in order to have good theoretical reasons to formulate a defi nition of religion that builds in the category of superhuman agents such as gods, goddesses, goblins, ghosts, angels, and ancestral spirits as essential distinguishing features of what counts as religion. This does not preclude, as some have feared it does, Aquinas, Maimonides, or Lao Tzu, for they, too, are part of the system we call "religion," mitigating its anthropomorphism; history shows, however, that mitigation is a largely parasitical enterprise. Does cognitive science of religion deal with truly "universal" human proclivities? Martin and Wiebe suggest otherwise in the example they themselves cite of the disparity between American and European views on creationism and evolution. I am not at all convinced that the dis turbing statistic indicating that as many as 60% of Americans reject evolution and natural selection can be explained as "atavistic inferences from these ordinary cognitive defaults exploited by religions." What we want is a form of explanation that relates this high percentage differen tially to the 20% of Europeans who reject evolution. Why is America seemingly different in having a much higher percentage of people who fall back on agent causality to make sense of the world? If it is indeed a "universal cognitive proclivity" to employ agent detection devices, why do its religious forms appear to be vanishing in Europe, Scandinavia, and other parts of the globe? The full answer, I suggest, will involve his torical and social studies, not cognitive or biological ones. Otherwise, the meaning of "natural" in cognitive science accounts of religion is in danger of coming to resemble the old myth of "the given," as though there can be something not shaped by human social practices. Inferences and proclivities, atavism and anthropomorphism, do not alone explain the complex semantic puzzle religions present.</page></plain_text>
