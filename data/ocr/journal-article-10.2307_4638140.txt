<plain_text><page sequence="1">the literature of awe BY DAVID BOSWORTH Art and Life. The territory of fiction is that boundary, pressed on both sides, between the senses and the sensible world-not just the outside event or that event's human witness, but the witness- ing itself, the marriage of observer and evidence, the act of experi- ence. Art is experience: experience human-crafted, experience stopped and translated; in short, experience imitated. And because art is human-crafted and therefore limited, it is experi- ence reduced. The extent to which an author reduces experience (tames, trims, reorders, deflates it) is no inconsequential matter. To bear witness, to be an author, to make art, is a profound act; there is no work more serious or demanding or finally audacious. And no work more liable to failure. For businessmen and farmers make products, and doctors and politicians provide services which sustain life, but authors dare to aspire to life's re-creation-they dare to show us what and how life actually is. To discuss serious fiction, then, is to discuss life. Elegant ex- changes addressed in the specialized vocabularies of critical canon are irrelevant here. What matters is life, what it is and how it is lived and the function art serves in the living of it. Fictional tech- niques are not important in themselves but because they imply the most basic truths; narrative strategies matter because they imply world views. Plot, style, point-of-view, the stuff whereof a story is made, reflect the stuff whereof life is made and how life is ordered. Plotted fiction implies a plotted universe; the plotless fiction of some modern authors (or as in Pynchon's case, the sub- version of plot) evokes a very different kind of world. When in "Fizzle 3" Samuel Beckett eschews traditional punctuation, using only commas to separate phrases, the effect is profound, present- ing a reality stripped of hierarchical order, or reality dramatically</page><page sequence="2">the literature of awe 5 different from that of, say, Daisy Miller or Absalom, Absalom. Debates over style, when viewed in this light, take on a relevance and gravity beyond the rationale for English department sympo- sia. In bearing witness to the act of experience, an author, whether consciously or not, makes judgments about the very nature of existence and what it means to be human; and the crafted experience he offers can challenge the most fundamental common-sense notions of what reality is. That different views of reality exist at all, of course, reveals in itself something basic about the human condition and about an art that tries to re-create that condition. We are born to a funda- mental uncertainty. We are sentient, thinking creatures but our sense and reason have their limits. We are bound by space and bound by time, held separate from the outside world, from the past and from the future. We can glimpse past these boundaries, we can compose a detailed reality from the data received, but that reality is still second-hand and incomplete, and even this second-hand reality is far too complex, astonishing, and immense for our rea- soning minds to comprehend fully. And we know that we do not comprehend. To know is to know that we do not know enough; to bear witness to the universe is to be shown how small we are (in space, in time) compared to that universe and how little we are able to control it. The price of consciousness, then, is the uncer- tainty caused by its incompleteness. And since the more "con- scious" we are, the more we are aware of that incompleteness, I would argue that this essential uncertainty, this felt discrepancy between what actually exists and what we rationally can know of existence, between the infinity "out there" and the finiteness of "me," is the most profound and honest reaction of a man to this world. Further, I would call that reaction "awe" and expect that fiction aspiring to art would make awe its special province. The awe I am speaking of is not simply intellectual or emo- tional or aesthetic, but all of these and all at once. The awe I am speaking of is best measured by its intensity; for it is, above all, an extremity of experience, the gift of consciousness stretched to its outermost limits, one man pressed right up against that boundary which separates him from the outside world. This communion- confrontation between the individual and creation, although po- tentially exhilarating, can terrify too. The balance is tipped from wonder to dread; the scope of our vision suddenly seems mina-</page><page sequence="3">6 the antioch review cious and intimidating. Because the world is so immense and complex, because we are so small in comparison to it, because we do have so little control, and, finally, because our truest moments impress us so vividly with these our natural limitations, we tend to retreat from those moments; we shy away from the experience of awe. And yet we have eyes and must see, have ears and must hear; we are, all of us, witnesses to creation, spectators by virtue of our very natures as sentient creatures to an awesome world. To deny awe, we must deny that world; we invent safer spectacles to play witness to, artificial doll-house realities, built of ideologies and easy isms, of rigid rituals and eviscerating theories. And we wor- ship these self-made realities fanatically, bow before these clinquant idols, the false gods of our false security. The problem is as old as civilized man. Much of the Old Testa- ment, that primal record of Western history, is laced with con- demnations of idolatry, and Isaiah's three-thousand-year-old, outraged lament that men were "bowing down to the work of their hands" seems just as relevant today as then. For the Hebraic obsession with banning idols from worship was based on a funda- mentally wise understanding of human nature. They realized that it was too easy to mistake an image of God for his actual presence; that a God reduced to human dimensions was a God robbed of his vital essence, which was beyond measurement and comprehension; that an image molded by human hands implied a God that men could manipulate. They, the ancient Israeli prophets, wanted instead to worship the less concrete but authentic God of the burning bush, the am-who-am, the swirling cloud in the Sinai Desert; they wanted their people to approach this irreducible God whose powerful presence evoked the experience of awe. But many Jews, as the prophets' own lamentations testify, were tempted by an easier path, bowing to Baal instead of Jehovah. And modern men are similarly tempted. The idols are differ- ent, of course, ranging from Sports Cars to Education, from the Bible itself to Revolution, but their nature is still the same, just as debilitating, just as profane-and just as false. Every ideology clung to tightly is idolatrous; every intellectual system-whether aesthetic, economic, or mathematical in nature if assumed to be Truth rather than a convenient strategy for approaching truth, is idolatrous. They are idolatrous because they set up in place of an awesome reality (call it God or Truth, the am-who-am or the</page><page sequence="4">the literature of awe 7 is-what-is) paler, surer playpen worlds whose contingencies are predictable but which only occasionally and accidentally match our experience. That we must try to understand our experience seems inevitable; that we must fail to understand our experience seems just as inevitable. Our idols serve to fill that gap between our drive to comprehend and our destiny to fall short of total com- prehension. And to a degree, the degree to which we must have a tentative theory to test for truth at all, they are necessary. But when hubris or panic sets in and we begin to accept these man- made images for Truth itself, then we bow to the work of our own hands and further estrange ourselves from the world as it really is. A fiction aspiring to art aspires to show us that world and must, therefore, ever be about the business of destroying the false gods that would hide it from us, ever challenge and subvert the current manifestations of that same age-old reductionist idolatry that shields us from the truth. An author aspiring to be an artist aspires in this sense, then, to the role of prophet, dismantling through the power of his words the Temple to Baal we all carry within us, for beyond those temples lie the vast, vast horizon, the illimitable expanse of creation-the experience of awe. This is why the work of the artist is so difficult and important, so frequently unpopular and occasionally dangerous; it's his business to shatter the pet illusions of his audience, those fashionable idols that so many hold so dear. This, too, is why the artist and the tyrant are always at odds, for absolute power requires an absolute reality to rationalize its existence, and so the tyrant must reduce the world to an idolatrous cartoon of perfect heroes and irredeemable foes, of ironclad moral certainties. But the artist, by the very nature of his work, reveals the flagrant falsehood of that counterfeit reality; he presents the world as it is, and the world as it is is never so simple nor so certain as the tyrant must make it appear to be. Must is the salient word here, with a twofold, intensified meaning; for in the tyrant, political necessity and psychic com- pulsion begin to merge, the tyrant-state a cancerous reification of a private insanity. Stalin, for example the murderer of Mandle- stam, the imprisoner of Solzhenitsyn, and harrasser of Paster- nak-was in a curious way as much victim as benefactor of his imposed world view, scarcely freer of his own tyranny than those he ruled. Towards the end, he had reduced his environment to one basic room, a self-sufficient womb he rarely left, a womb he had</page><page sequence="5">8 the antioch review re-created in all the cities he commonly visited so that no matter where he went, he always appeared to be in the exact same place. The same dimensions, the same furnishings in the same positions, day after day after day; no matter where he was, the same four walls greeted him: his own Temple to Baal; his own gulag cell, if you will; his own sentence of imprisonment. The special and monstrous evil of Stalin, of course, was that he imposed this madness on the Soviet people; private compulsion became public policy as he tried to squeeze an entire country into one spare, unchanging room. And those like Mandlestam who resisted him, who refused to accept his cartoon reality, he imprisoned or killed. The lesson here goes beyond its obvious historical importance, for the classic confrontation between the artist and the dictator recapitulates on a larger scale each man's solitary struggle for truth and sanity, and it reminds us that we are all vulnerable to a fear-tempted tyrant who lurks in our psyches. Few of us possess the rampant megalomania of a Stalin, of course, but we all to some degree condemn ourselves as he did to a prison-cell world. We hide within our habits, within our inflexible moralities and acquired prejudices, wrap ourselves in a perceptual cocoon that blinds us from a reality we find too awesome to confront. We are, in short, afraid. And we are afraid because to catch a glimpse of the world as it actually exists is to sense, if only fleetingly, the powerlessness of our condition here. It is to sense, too, though, a world dazzling in its intricacy, beauty, and scope, a world whose colors, shapes, and sounds delight and astound. And that range of response from dread to wonder, when pressed right up against the boundary between oneself and creation, encompasses the most basic decision of all in life: brought to the top of the mountain, we either turn away and shrink our world or expand ourselves to embrace the view; we either bow to Baal or worship Jehovah, choose either the antiseptic room of Josef Stalin or the vast and vivid landscape of DoctorZhivago. And the right choice is not the easy one. Our fear is so primal, our instinct for self-protection so powerful, our reasoning minds so given to the production of intellectual idols, that only in rare moments do we transcend the tyranny within and choose to bear witness to the whole truth. Instead, to anesthetize our fear, we perjure ourselves, and the price ~"-a&amp;t-d for this temporary relief is dear indeed. Our sedations kill the pieasure with the pain; we turn</page><page sequence="6">the literature of awe 9 numb, wonderless, unaware. Condemned to a chrysalis of self- woven illusions, we are not prepared, our only defense against danger the sorry pretense that it isn't there. And when danger comes, as it inevitably must, when suffering invades and through the rent holes in our flimsy cocoons the world of awe is suddenly made visible, then our eyes, too long accustomed to the dark, ache all the more painfully in the light of the truth. It is the necessary and special function of the best literature to intervene in this struggle on the side of truth, to light candles in our self-imposed darkness and illuminate the real world. It is the function of the best fiction to save us from ourselves, from our own illusions, from our idols and ideologies-from our pretense of control. But to understand the importance of literature is first to admit its fallibility. Fiction, too, is reductionist; like all human striving after truth, it is but a pale approximation of life. It is a special kind of approximation, however, in that it engages us, as does reality itself, through the senses, in that it aims to re-create the experience of life rather than just to abstract life's meaning. Thus, although fiction, because it is human, must reduce, its uniquely imitative nature makes it among our least reductionist ways of knowing: Anna Karenina, while not equal to the experi- ence of love, comes far closer to evoking that experience than some psychological treatise on the subject or a physiological description of dilating pupils and palpitating hearts. This mimetic quality of fiction, which is both its most obvious and definitive feature, places the author in a tenuous position. He finds himself straddling two ever-divided ledges, the precarious paradox that best describes his difficult mission: he aims for the whole truth, trying to show reality as it actually is, while forced to reduce that truth, so awesome in scope, to human dimensions. His is the nearly impossible goal of condensing reality without changing its essence. Given the difficulty of the task, failures clearly outnumber successes; and, of course, some "literature" never even attempts to sustain the necessary balance between verisimilitude and artifice. Propaganda and most genre fiction, to take obvious examples, imitate not life but models previously abstracted from life (political doctrine and esthetic convention), and by enshrining those cultural idols in place of, aty, they confirm or institute our perceptual prejudices. The heroic worker who always conquers in</page><page sequence="7">10 the antioch review the end, the wily detective who in the final scene always solves the mystery at hand-these, it seems almost redundant to say, are not metaphors of the life we share; the world we live in is not nearly so sure, so circumscribed by comprehensible rules, so adamantly resolved. Genre literature is not a mirror to life as it is, but to life as we wish it to be, as it never can be, and we enter the radically idealized world of certain books just as we enter a sports col- iseum-not to discover truth but to escape it, to find an hour's respite from the real and anxious uncertainties of everyday life. Of course entertainment is to be valued in its own right. Of course some genre fiction surpasses its own limitations while much "arty" fiction can't even succeed as simple diversion. Of course there is no absolute line separating popular literature from art, and any one work can have both sublime and inept moments in varying proportions. Great works of art can be popular; detective novels can illuminate the truth, and to believe otherwise is to make the kind of blind prejudgment that constitutes the very idolatry I am warning against. But even as we recognize the possi- bility of any piece of fiction ascending to art, we must continue to distinguish exceptions from rules. Entertainment passes time; art confronts it. Propaganda perpetuates idols; art destroys them. Serious art and popular literature, if not mutually exclusive, are not the same, and it serves no good end, aesthetic or political, to pretend that they are. And yet, that very equation is being made today, certain "egalitarian" critics insisting on the superiority of popular forms. The danger these critics represent, however, lies not in the litera- ture they choose to support-popular fiction, serving its own and often legitimate purposes, will, after all, always have a follow- ing-but in the enervating cynicism that would equate those purposes with art. And that cynicism is not limited to a few radical professors or to any set number of issues or arguments; rather, it constitutes a tone, a pervasive and sinister modern attitude which, infecting our spirit and corrupting our thought, has led us to overvalue a kind of "serious" literature that has failed to achieve art's highest ends. This failure, it should be stressed, is by no means solely a literary event, but a cultural phenomenon in the widest sense. The literature of despair that has flourished in the mid-twentieth century, as typified by such authors as Beckett and Kosinski, has its philosophical counterpart in nearly every aspect</page><page sequence="8">the literature of awe 11 of Western society: Behaviorism in psychology, the International Style of architecture, Minimalism in the visual arts, and a certain social-engineering approach to government. What these appar- ently dissimilar movements share, I would argue, to the detri- ment of the people they serve, is a reductionist view of human nature, a view which, engrained in our culture, is the product of a long, complex historical process. And if we are to grasp why that view is mistaken, if we are to understand exactly how the literature of despair has failed us, it is to that process we first must turn, to the intellectual tradition of the Western world. For most of recorded time, mankind's basic model or meta- phor of reality was anthropomorphic; the physical world was explained in human terms, physical events given human motiva- tions. But in the seventeenth century, with the advent of classical mechanics and the scientific method, a pronounced change began to take place. Aiming for a simple, objective description of reality, thinkers began to disassociate themselves from certain traditional preoccupations of natural philosophy. Purpose, meaning, the why of existence were left to the church, the unified if flawed approach to knowledge that had predominated since ancient times, aban- doned for a more specialized study. The goal then became what not why, and the assumption was that the answer could be found by an ever finer dissection of reality, a paring away of illusory qualities that would eventually reveal some elementary, unchange- able particle of truth. Measurement became the method, numbers the language; subjective human experience, so complex and chaotic, so dependent on the senses, was generally dismissed as unreliable. And the final result was a model that confidently reduced reality, despite all its apparent diversity, to just two fundamental concepts: there was matter and there was motion. Reality consisted of so many identical, indivisible atoms which, existing in a vacuum, were caught up in a chain reaction of cause- and-effect movements. This dehumanization of the world picture, this shift in metaphors from organism to mechanism, had a profound effect on Western culture. For what began primarily as a way of des- cribing the stars gradually became a way of describing everyday life, until, by the early twentieth century, an ironic reversal had taken place. Whereas in the beginning man saw the physical world as an extension of himself to be described in human terms,</page><page sequence="9">12 the antioch review man now saw himself as an extension of the physical world to be described in physical terms. At first this shift in self-image, as articulated in the newborn "social" sciences (sociology, psy- chology, Darwinian biology), aroused a surge of optimism. There was the hope, even the expectation, that mankind's happiness could be engineered by a studied application of those same prin- ciples that first had been applied to the distant stars. But almost immediately problems arose. That radically ab- stracted metaphor of so many atoms bouncing in a void, which even physical science was forced to amend, proved especially incompatible with human experience. It spoke a language mathematics-so severely abstracted that most of daily life was lost in translation, all the diversity and splendor, all the emotive content of man's sensual existence, dismissed by implication as illusory or irrelevant. Its reductionist assumption that the whole was equal to the simple sum of its atomistic parts ignored the organizational complexity of living things. And finally, not only did it fail as an accurate and practical description of man, it never addressed man's basic need for meaning and purpose. This last failing, of course, was hardly the fault of classical science; born in an age when the church utterly controlled metaphysical specula- tion, it had never aimed to answer those larger questions. But by the twentieth century, when the church had lost most of its authority, science was more and more dominating man's common-sense way of understanding the world; and what had begun three hundred years before as an honest attempt to limit goals was then being perceived as an actual limit on reality itself. The failure to ask the question began to assume the shape of an answer; a description of a reality that ignored meaning implied a reality that was in fact meaningless. If atoms, the primary particles of matter, move only from external causes, and if man is made of matter, then aren't all human actions caused externally as well? Isn't all human behavior a mere link in a complex causal chain, free will, morality, justice merely subjective, therefore irrelevant notions which hide the true "objective" reality of particles of matter bouncing in a vacuum? The implications were as ironic as they were dispiriting; even as man was achieving his most impressive physical feats-controlling the environment, curing disease-he was falling victim to self- doubt and despair. He had reduced the world in order to get</page><page sequence="10">the literature of awe 13 better control, but in the process he had reduced himself. Once again means had been mistaken for ends; once again man had mistaken an idea of reality for reality itself, "bowing down to the work of [his own] hands." The tyrant-within had won, declaring himself absolute ruler of the realm; but the realm was an abstrac- tion, a two-dimensional, colorless map, his power an illusion sus- tained at the expense of his basic nature. This process of self-abstraction, this denial of the subjective side to human nature, can be traced in almost every field of thought through the twentieth century. In psychology, interest in states of consciousness (James) gave way to the early experi- mentalists (Watson), who excluded consciousness from study because it couldn't be observed or measured in the laboratory, and then to the pure Behaviorists (Skinner), who took that exclu- sion one step further by denying that consciousness existed at all. In visual arts, representational works gave way first to more abstracted renderings of recognizable forms (Cubism, for ex- ample), then to work without any recognizable forms (Abstract Expressionism), and finally, to conceptual art, where the "idea" and the work were one and the same, a typed proposal replacing a canvas. A psychology that denies consciousness? an art that has no visual existence?-these oxymorons are the result of reduc- tionism gone berserk, of abstraction carried to its furthest limits, the complete conquest of theory over sense, of concept over ex- perience, and they typify a dominant intellectual imbalance, which has drastically debased man's perception of himself. If we return to fiction, the relevance of this detour into the history of ideas now becomes apparent; for literature, which is always both mirror to and product of its surrounding culture, could no more escape the misperceptions of its age than could psychology or painting. Fiction, too, succumbed to the prevailing reductionism, to an eviscerating impoverishment of man's self- image. If we take the basic model from classical physics of so many identical atoms bouncing off each other in an infinite vacuum and translate it to social reality, where an individual man, not much different from those around him and lacking an effec- tive "inner self," is pushed and prodded by forces beyond his control and comprehension, the result is an eerily accurate paradigm of the modern anti-heroic novel. The landscape barren, the language stripped, the pervasive tone of despair leavened only</page><page sequence="11">14 the antioch review by a desperate wit, the characters too existentially inept to control themselves, their fate, their environment; behind it all the sure belief that life is irredeemably meaningless-we've all experienced this fictional world in the works of Vonnegut, Beckett, Kosinski, and others. That it expresses an attitude prevalent in modern Western culture is beyond dispute, but the question remains whether that attitude is correct or desirable. Does this fictional world meet the high standards of art? Does it bear witness to the whole truth by re-creating the experience of reality as it actually is? Are its authors modern-day prophets, warning us against our intellectual idols, or are they unwitting servants to Baal, them- selves victims of the age's illusions? The Literature of Despair. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., succinctly sums up his own world view in the opening chapter of The Sirens of Titan when the narrator, a voice set in the far future, describes our present age as a time when men discovered in space "what had already been found in abundance on Earth-a nightmare of meaninglessness without end . . . empty heroics, low comedy, and pointless death." A witness to one of World War II's worst massacres, the Allied fire-bombing of Dresden, Vonnegut ex- presses a relentlessly pessimistic vision of man, a pessimism far surpassing the cynic's belief in the eventual victory of evil or the fundamentalist's version of a fall from grace. For there can be no victory without a battle and no fall if one from the start is ines- capably mired at the bottom of the pit. The moral drama between right and wrong loses all meaning if men are not free to choose and competent to act, and Vonnegut sees man as neither com- petent nor free. In his fictional world, there are no villains and, as well, no heroes to oppose them; both good and evil are beyond man's grasp. When he writes in the introduction to Slaughter- house-Five that he learned in college "there was absolutely no difference between anybody," the ironic tone does not belie the accuracy of the words. Vonnegut does believe that all men are the same, and to read his fiction is to meet a cast of characters who are uniformly pathetic, helpless victims of a random, incoherent, meaningless existence, and whose suffering, unmitigated by any true higher purpose, is distinguished only by the self-delusions embraced to relieve it.</page><page sequence="12">the literature of awe 15 It is precisely this unrelievedly debased view of man that cripples Vonnegut's fiction and undermines his effectiveness as a moral critic. Caught in a conflict between what he wishes and what he believes, between what he wants for mankind and what he thinks mankind is fated to have, his fiction constantly exposes folly only to submit to inevitability. In Vonnegut's books, anger- which is, after all, a kind of hope is always defeated by resigna- tion, his criticism of society always emasculated by his final belief that man can do no better. The Player Piano, Vonnegut's first novel, reveals most clearly this sad process of self-defeat. Its plot set at some future date when a fully automated America is being run by an oligarchy of technocrats, the book has as its satiric target the same mechanization of society discussed in this essay. At the outset, the main character, Dr. Paul Proteus, whose late father was a founder of the technocracy, is himself on the verge of ascending to the highest levels of authority within the organiza- tion. But just as he had a difficult relationship with his father, Proteus has a difficult time adjusting to the society his father helped engineer. He lacks ambition, he finds himself attracted to that society's outcasts and critics, and eventually he is persuaded by a charismatic preacher called Lasher to lend his prestigious name to an organized rebellion against the state. At this point in the narrative, Vonnegut seems to be flirting with transforming Proteus into a realistic hero, a character who has overcome his weakness by choosing a moral and courageous course of action. But an habitual debunker, Vonnegut must debunk his own spokesman as well; a despairing egalitarian, he mustn't allow one character to surpass the others in moral stature. Proteus is captured, put on trial, and then, just as he seems to be reaching heroic proportions, expressing Vonnegut's own argu- ments against an automated society, he is abruptly reduced to the level of his enemies. As he testifies, Proteus is strapped to a lie detector which finally "reveals" that his "true" motivation for joining the revolt was a subconscious hatred of his father and not some elevated moral ideal. The nobility of his sacrifice (and by implication his argument) undermined, Proteus can't deny the results; he admits that the accusation is probably true, adding that "sordid things, for the most part, are what make human beings . . . move." He tries, though, to insist that the revolt can be "right" no matter what his motivation for joining it; but the</page><page sequence="13">16 the antioch review only image he can summon to convince his courtroom audience is that "some of the most beautiful peonies" he has ever seen were grown in "pure cat excrement." One can sense in these final words, this strained metaphor, Vonnegut himself struggling through Proteus for some satisfac- tory answer, and when rebels burst into the courtroom, ending the scene, it is the author as much as his character who is being rescued, saved from the contradictions inherent in his point of view. He wants to criticize the mechanization of society for making life meaningless, but he himself believes life to be funda- mentally meaningless. He wants to support Proteus over his enemies, but he himself believes that "there is absolutely no dif- ference between anybody," that we are all "moved" by "sordid things." Vonnegut's problem, you see, is that although he abhors our mechanized culture, he believes the world view upon which it is based; his vision of mankind-so many like individuals pushed by forces beyond their control-is really the same, nothing more than that same mechanistic metaphor misapplied again. And the result of that misapplication is always the same: pes- simism, cynicism, resignation, despair. At the novel's end, the rebellion is easily crushed and the futility of the enterprise emphasized when Vonnegut has Lasher, his most competent character, admit that their revolt had been doomed from the start, that it had been merely "for the record," a symbolic gesture, a fist shaken against an onrushing tank. There will be no more serious rebellions in Vonnegut's fiction and no more flirtations with realistic heroism; there will be no more waiting till the end of the book to point out the futility of symbolic gestures. The implications of his thinking now clear, his subsequent novels will begin where The Player Piano ends, with characters trapped in a fate they can neither change nor escape, doomed to a nightmare existence of "low comedy and pointless death." But Vonnegut is, above all else, a compassionate man; he may not respect his characters, but he does care about them, is driven by an urge to ease their suffering. Given the pessimism of his outlook, however, all he can offer is the very solution he so often mocks: illusion, fantasy, the "harmless untruths" of Bokonism, of Tralfamadorian metaphysics, the soothing escapism of Billy Pilgrim's time-travel. As his recurring character, Eliot Rosewater, says to a psychiatrist in Slaughterhouse-Five, "I think</page><page sequence="14">the literature of awe 17 you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies, or people just aren't going to want to go on living." And there it is again, the same basic conflict resurfacing-between thought and feeling, between the artist and the humanitarian. Vonnegut wants to tell us the truth and at the same time spare us from it; he wants to ease our pain and at the same time show us that only "lies" can achieve that end. To comfort, he must lie; to tell the truth, he must hurt; for in the world as Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., sees it, happiness is utterly incompatible with truth. What he believes is what he hates; the peonies are still there, but now they are fake, manufactured illusions to ease our pain-only the excrement real. But as bleak as the fictional world of Slaughterhouse-Five seems to be, there is another that is bleaker still. The loneliness, the despair, the suffering beyond hope of redemption, the disgust and self-disgust, the rank and relentless debasement of mankind, in short, that "nightmare" version of existence that has so affected the sensibility of the age, is etched in its most resolute purity in the fictional works of Samuel Beckett. Beckett is the extreme, the quintessence, the soul of modernist writing stripped of all obscuring flesh: its philosopher; and because he dares to draw out every hidden assumption to its ultimate conclusion, he is the clearest example of why reductionist fiction fails. For Beckett, existence is, as the first-person narrator of Molloy says, "sense- less, speechless, issueless misery," his typical character (and there is a typical Beckett character; again the atomistic vision, again the reduction to a sorry sameness) even more pathetic than Billy Pilgrim. Molloy, Moran, Malone are all trapped in the same state of inescapable ignorance; for them "all grows dim," their "sight and hearing are very bad," their memories almost nonexistent; their first-person narrations are jeremiads of epistemological doubt, littered with "I don't know's," "I wasn't sure's," "I can't remember's"-every statement qualified by a subsequent uncer- tainty. Molloy, at various points in his narration, can't remember his name, the name of his mother, which of his legs is lame, whether he has a son and by whom he had one, and he is forced to absorb what little information he receives "through that mist . . which rises in me every day and veils the world from me and veils me from myself." Isolated in this impoverished world of dim shapes and obscure sounds, of unreliable information, unable to retrieve the past or apprehend the present, Molloy, Moran, Ma-</page><page sequence="15">18 the antioch review lone are brought to the ultimate uncertainty best expressed by Malone's resigned statement: "I shall go on doing as I have always done, not knowing what it is I do, nor who I am, nor where I am, nor if I am." The metaphysical ignorance emphasized by Vonne- gut has been taken one step further here. Doubt has corrupted the very process of knowing, rendering all the world unintelligible. Vonnegut's characters cannot know why they live, but Beckett's cannot know even ifthey live, cannot confirm even the most mun- dane facts of their existence. Such an inherent and therefore inescapable ignorance implies, of course, an incompetence too-if man cannot know, what can he do?-an incompetence that in Beckett's fiction is immediate and physical. The disgust of the human body, seen in mild degrees in Vonnegut (Billy Pilgrim's orgasmic moan is described as sound- ing like a "small, rusty hinge"), is further exaggerated in Beckett's prose, for he, like his character Moran, finds "a horror of the body and its functions" "the most fruitful of dispositions." Once again Beckett, the extremist, extends mankind's reductionist debase- ment. Bodies rot, stink, vomit, slobber, their decay detailed with a graphic obsession; sex is portrayed as a tiresome coupling of hobbled animals, a lowly comic act. Good for only pain, the body gives no pleasure and is impotent to perform even the simplest functions. Not only are Molloy and Moran nearly deaf and blind, but they are lame as well, and Malone, poor Malone, cannot move from his bed. This physical impotence is complementary to and symbolic of a larger impotence as well; when Malone says, "I could die to-day, if I wished, merely by making a little effort," he has to add the obliterating qualifiers, "if I could wish, if I could make an effort." Man's incompetence has reached its ultimate culmina- tion; in Vonnegut's world, despair was based on the discrepancy between wishes and facts; in Beckett's world, even wishing is beyond man's grasp. This existential ignorance and impotence insure a condition of loneliness too; unable to see or hear, unable to move, and thus, like Molloy's deaf and dumb mother, almost completely cut off from the outside world, Beckett's characters are beings apart. This isolation is at its most superficial a social and physical fact- Malone and Molloy are locked up in their rooms, the Murphy of "Fizzle 1" trapped in the wet-stone gloom of an underground labyrinth, each man an individual, an integer, alike but apart and</page><page sequence="16">the literature of awe 19 cut off from those who surround him. But in Beckett the atomistic reduction is further extended, the integer itself split asunder, the estrangement becoming a self-estrangement, an apartness from self. That "mist," after all, "veils" not only the world from Molloy, but Molloy from himself, the mind, or perhaps more ac- curately the voice, severed from the body and, to an extent, from the emotions as well. The room within which the voice is trapped has become the body within which the voice is trapped, an exis- tential prison. "You may say that it is all in my head," Malone asserts, "and indeed sometimes it seems to me I am in a head.... But thence to conclude the head is mine, no, never." By condition ignorant, by condition impotent, by condition alone; an obsessive voice, "crying out more or less piercingly," unable to escape a decaying body, a suffering self-this is Beckett's vision of man, a vision that, embraced with a curious enthusiasm, admits of no qualifying alternatives. There is, in fact, in both authors discussed above, a similar relentlessness, not only an accord on the general meanness and meaningless of existence, but a similarly obsessive repetition of the evidence. Like Moran, who has "an extremely sensitive ear" yet "no ear for music," they play the same dissonant note again and again, until the reader begins to understand that to hear that note is to hear the score, that the "whole" in the anti-heroic novel tends to be equal to merely one of its parts. Vonnegut's books, for example, usually consist of many, short, generically identical passages, passages anecdotal in nature and ironic in tone and whose punchline con- clusions always serve to evoke the pathetic qualities of the characters described: section after section of sadly comic put- downs. And Beckett, as would be expected, extends this approach to its furthest limits; for when Molloy says, "You would do better, at least no worse, to obliterate texts than to blacken margins, to fill in the holes of words till all is blank and flat and the whole ghastly business looks like what is, senseless, speechless, issueless misery," he is in effect describing Beckett's own fictional style. Beckett writes his words, but then fills them in; he makes a state- ment, then denies its truth; he creates characters only to reduce them in stature; he floats dim hopes only to obliterate them. And this strategy of relentless negation eventually infiltrates the nar- rative itself. After all, if Molloy, Moran, Malone are incompetent</page><page sequence="17">20 the antioch review and ignorant, can their first-person narrations be at all reliable? If every fact reported is called into question, can any of the story be accepted as true? The answer to a purist like Beckett is an obvious no; even the doubts must be called into doubt, the text "oblit- erated" along with the story it tells, and thus Moran is made to undermine the credibility of his entire narrative by using his last words to deny his first: "I . . . wrote, 'It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows.' It was not midnight. It was not raining." [Internal quotes mine.] Beyond these stylistic similarities, though, the most significant aspect shared by all the books discussed above is their drastically diminished view of man. Men shit and piss and pick their noses, brutalize each other and themselves, but they never dance with grace, never experience beauty, love, satisfaction, are never shown achieving or creating or conquering a problem. Now men do shit and piss and pick their noses, they do brutalize each other and themselves, but that is not all they do; and what are we to say about a literature that limits itself to only those aspects of exis- tence that deny either overtly or by implication any positive quality in human nature? Are we to praise it, as has been the case so often in modern criticism, for its honesty and courage, for what A. Alvarez calls Beckett's "remorseless stripping away of super- fluities"? But are love, compassion, wonder, courage really "superfluities"? Are they really irrelevant to the human condi- tion? And is this "stripping away"-so analogous to the stripping away of consciousness from the study of mind in Behaviorism, and of the actual object from the act of creation in conceptual art- really a method that will unveil the truth, or is it, in fact, a method that obscures the truth by denying its complexity? The problem, then, we begin to see, is not the reductionist author's pessimism per se, but his failure to "earn" his pessimism on the printed page, his stripping away essentials as well as super- fluities in presenting his case. Instead of tracing love's defeat, he pretends that love isn't there, that it doesn't exist; instead of creating a world, complex and ambiguous, within which to explore man's ultimate failure, he invents another world, flat and barren, within which failure is prescribed from the start. No one can deny Kurt Vonnegut's right to despair after his experience as a prisoner of war, but if he expects us to accept that view as funda- mentally true, his fiction will have to account for more of the evi-</page><page sequence="18">the literature of awe 21 dence, just as even a history of the Holocaust must include and consider the men and women who hid Jews in their homes at the risk of death. But instead we are given a pre-molded, idolatrous fiction, wherein the immeasurable has been reduced to the defi- nite, the complex to the simple, mankind to Billy Pilgrim, reality to Samuel Beckett's exitless room: a fiction which seems to stack the evidence, insisting always on the same final answer. That this "answer" given by the literature of despair is that there is no answer does not mitigate the charge; the ubiquitous uncertainty promoted by Beckett, after all, is itself a kind of deluding certainty, the same reply again and again to every-to ever-aspect of existence. And this relentless naysaying is no closer to the truth of things than a relentless yeasaying, Beckett's constant pessimism no less deluding than a Pollyanna optimism; they are, in fact, mirror images of the same perceptual fanaticism, which "strips away" ambiguity at the expense of truth. And it is essential in an age so susceptible to cynicism and despair to grasp this parallel, to understand that a "blackwash" of reality is no truer, no more courageous or honest, than a "whitewash," that both are "cover-ups," that both hide a complex, multiform, and multi-colored canvas and as such constitute a kind of surrender, a forfeiture of the artist's high responsibility to bear witness to an infinite and ambiguous world. The corrupting consequence of this philosophical surrender eventually appears in the books themselves, the limit they place on man ironically invoking a limit on their craft, the resulting repeti- tiveness of both message and technique diminishing their ability to elicit a response. As funny and touching as these authors some- times can be, the longer one reads them, the less effective they seem to become. Just as Malone, "cowering deep down among [his sufferings feels] nothing," the reader, immured in Beckett's relentless pessimism, begins to feel nothing. That "piercing" cry, so rarely relieved by a whisper or a sigh, assaults the ear till the ear grows deaf, till, in a revealing example of the imitative fallacy, a literature describing men who are incapable of emotion becomes itself incapable of evoking emotion-a lifeless text. This connec- tion between man as failure and an art that fails, between a message of failure and a failure of effect, has a certain philosophi- cal inevitability. Since fiction is itself a man-made product, any fiction espousing man's essential incompetence must, if it is at all</page><page sequence="19">22 the antioch review honest, eventually espouse its own incompetence. Thence the post-World War II cry, "The novel is dead!"-for how can any literature exist if man is, in fact, too existentially ignorant to know his world? The trap, then, is set and sadly inescapable, the anti-heroic author a victim of his own premises: a fiction that loses faith in man must eventually lose faith in itself; a literature of defeat must eventually become self-defeating and deny its own validity. On the first page of Molloy, the narrative voice admits, "I don't know. The truth is I don't know much." On page 17 of Slaughterhouse- Five, a two-hundred-page book about a massacre, we read that "there's nothing intelligent to say about a massacre." The former book ends with one of the narrators denying the credibility of all he has said; the latter ends with "all there is to say about a massacre": a bird's meaningless chirp. The circle, we see, is now complete, the connection to a pancultural reductionism now drawn clearer; for the anti-heroic novel provides us with the perfect oxymoronic analogue to a psychology that denies con- sciousness and to an art that has no visual existence: a literature that has nothing to say. Beyond Despair. The works of Vonnegut and Beckett are just two examples of an entire body of literature whose basic perspec- tive is one of despair. And the reason for this literature's existence rests not solely on the traumatic events of our past half century (the modern age, after all, is hardly unique in its violent history) but also on the acceptance of certain crucial ideas, a mode of thinking, that when made manifest in the very fabric of society, transformed man's view of himself and his world. We can point out the limited value of this reductionist view, how it distorts and deflates human experience, but we can hardly ignore its influence on the modern sensibility. Despair, in this sense, is real. Although a fashion, it is not merely fashionable, not just a quick and incon- sequential fad; rather, arising from our most basic assumptions about reality, it lies at the center of our culture, symptomatic of a flaw in our view of the world. And it is in this sense, too, of course, that the literature of despair does (despite its own pose that nothing can be said) have something to say to us. Vonnegut's often hilarious, sad-edged</page><page sequence="20">the literature of awe 23 irony, Beckett's suffocating immersion into a traumatized psyche do reflect a real aspect of modem life and have a value we should recognize. But the severe limits of these authors should be recog- nized as well, limits that too far surpass the inescapable limita- tions placed on all artists by the nature of their craft. No novel, no fiction writer's oeuvre, can be equal to life, but the literature of despair, in an important way, fails even to approximate life. Just as a series of magnified photos of acne scars tells us too little about a human face, the incredible obsessiveness with which Beckett depicts just one possible state of mind, while admirable perhaps in its clinical accuracy, in the end tells us too little about human experience. One might argue, of course, that a larger metaphor was never intended, but to believe this and at the same time to accept Beckett as a great artist seems an overvaluation of a limited accomplishment and a sad diminution of the potential of art. Our best authors-Melville, Conrad, Faulkner (none of whom could be described as cheery optimists)-have always given us more: more of the whole face of human experience, not just one part. The literature of despair fails us, then, because, like Behavior- ism, its metaphorical world is too specialized and reduced, too abstracted to capture that whole, "felt" truth that the best fiction has always rediscovered for us. By presenting some small truths to the exclusion of all others, by stripping them of any complicating context, it is too much the captive of its own conclusions about reality. The difficult question remains, though, why anyone would choose to champion those conclusions, why despair is not only reluctantly accepted as in Vonnegut, but enthusiastically embraced as in Samuel Beckett. Why, at least for a time, did the violent ending replace the happy ending as the cliched convention of popular entertainment? Why is it so frequently the case in this modern age that we, as Molloy, don't "like [the] gloom to lighten," finding instead something "nourishing" in the "murk" that sur- rounds us? Despair, it seems, has its own peculiar consolations and the literature of despair its own peculiar attractiveness to something basic in human nature. The tyrant-within craves his cartoon reality, the secret idolater his hand-sized god; fearful and anxious, we beg for simple and predictable answers, a resolution of the tension that is the enduring cost of the gift of consciousness. It is a measure of our essential insecurity that we are tempted to accept even the blackest world view if it simultaneously succeeds</page><page sequence="21">24 the antioch review in simplifying reality; and it is exactly this form of perceptual security, this reduction to certainty, that despair and its literature offer us: the hand-sized god, the cartoon realm, Stalin's unchang- ing room where all things sit in their appointed place. That this god may be defined as malevolent, that life in Stalin's cell may prove utterly barren, seems, to some, less impor- tant than an end to the anxiety that inevitably comes from trying to judge an ambiguous world. Like Murphy in "Fizzle 1," who shuts his eyes rather than stare into the gloom to search for light, the man of despair also closes his eyes and, by prejudging his world black, spares himself the potential disappointment of a continued search. And here we begin to see the special temptation of a bleak world view, what "blind" despair offers that "blind" faith can't. Bad news, after all, is less traumatic if expected, and for those unable to tolerate anxiety, hope is, as Moran calls it, a "hellish" experience. Thus, like a jilted lover who chooses to assume that all women are liars in order to spare himself the chance of being hurt again, the despairing man chooses to assume that all life is miserable in order to spare himself those traumatic disappointments he fears. Despair, then, in a world of uncertain rewards and punishments, is embraced by the fearful as a defense against pain; but it is a desperate and self-deluding defense that accepts a dull imprisonment, a shutdown of the senses, as a hedge against emotional collapse. For just as a society unable to cope with uncertainty surrenders itself to the rule of a tyrant, so does a man unable to cope with anxiety surrender himself to the tyrant- within. Malone's room mirrors Stalin's room mirrors Stalin's reign. It is to this same impoverished room that the anti-heroic authors condemn us-to a stripped and barren cell of their own invention, a cell which, they imply, is an apt metaphor for the larger reality we share. But in the end, despite occasional flashes of recognition, that metaphor is more alien than familiar-alien because it is too simple and sure, because instead of staring out, its authors seem to write as Murphy lives, with their eyes closed, advocates ahead of time of a point of view. Theirs is a self-confirm- ing, stereotyped world, an abstracted world of limited options, of final answers; as such, it constitutes a kind of philosophical propaganda and becomes, in the end, too much a form of genre literature-the genre of despair.</page><page sequence="22">the literature of awe 25 But we do not need more genre literature or more propa- gandist art; we do not need a fiction that eviscerates truth by making it simply equivalent to unhappiness. Living in a complex and confusing world, we are already too vulnerable to simple- minded solutions, to strategies of comprehension that mill down all the diverse data of life into neatly categorized, homogenous pellets-the computer's binomial zero and one, the paranoid's capitalized Us and Them-reductions which, if pleasing in their simplicity, violate the nature of our experience, implying a "flatter" reality than actually exists. What we do need, and what, in fact, great literature provides, is a counteracting force, an antidote to the very reductionism that so dominates our everyday lives. In a world raucous with solutions, we don't need more answers but a restoration of life's raw data, an act of perception that, exposing our idols as pale simulacra, evokes the primary experience of existence in all its fullness. It is experience, not abstraction, that great art offers, and although the great author, in fact, may have a philosophical perspective, it is not his "mes- sage" that makes him special but his mimetic talent, his ability to see and make us see the experience of life as it actually is-less reduced than whole, less explained than felt: the subjective truth of the world we share. And he reminds us, by recapturing the wholeness of that subjective truth, that life is always more than our "ideas" about it, always much more than any final meaning we choose to assign it. "Know the truth," Jesus said to the men who questioned him, "and the truth will make you free"; but to know the truth in a world so wonderous, so frightening, so uncertain and varied, so immense and pulsing with intensity is no simple matter of answers or beliefs. Reality will never be as safe or certain as we wish it to be, as we pretend it to be; and if we are not the "slaves to sin" whom Jesus described, we are all of us at times-slaves to our insecurity. To be free, to know the truth, we must somehow escape the idolatrous illusions we invent for ourselves; to be wise and to be good, to act truly and to act well, we must first see the world as it actually is, make that difficult search for the reality of things. The special gift and moral significance of serious fiction rest in its ability to enact that search, to seduce us, through its evocative depiction of other men and women, into an expanded view of that larger world which lurks beyond the habit-shrunk borders of our</page><page sequence="23">26 the antioch review everyday lives. Good fiction forces us to be more than ourselves, makes us a little less finite in this infinite universe, and is, there- fore, like evolution itself, an expression of life's highest aspira- tions. The literature of despair, however, insists on the futility of those aspirations, on restricting that search; it insists on making us less than we are: will-less Billy Pilgrims, impotent Malones, faint stick figures in a cartoon void. It preaches the simplest answer of all: that there is no answer and no reason to hope. Times change, of course, and with them fashions; the bleak vision of life that peaked in the sixties already is losing its popu- larity. A simple reflexive reaction, however, a mirror-image swing of fashion's pendulum, is not a sufficient response to the chal- lenges posed by the literature of despair. The goal is not to replace a bleak formula with a benign one, but with a fiction without formulas. The goal is not to overthrow a grim-visaged idol for a smiling one, but an idol-less literature. For as plants reach out to colonize the open spaces, as all life reaches out in time and space to invade the unknown, so must our best fiction dare to extend itself in its exploration for the truth. And this exploration demands flexibility; it demands, above all else, a refusal to pre- clude any possibility, the artist pressed right up against that permeable border between himself and creation, eyes open all the time. The compass of awe includes both terror and joy and the palpable uncertainty that will occur; the literature of awe, like all true explorations, is a mapless journey whose end is obscure. But if we are to rescue ourselves from the tyrant-within, from the per- ceptual idols we ceaselessly invent, it is a journey we must have the courage to make. Whether we are left with the secure apathy of Beckett's room or the uncertain hopes of an infinite world, whether we are left with a fiction of negation which must eventually deny even its own validity or a fiction of creation which, risking failure, insists on becoming more than its words, depends on us-and there is no escaping our responsibility. As writers, as readers, as heirs and witnesses to the human condition, we must, by default or volition, choose an attitude to the life we've been given: the surrender of despair or the ambition of art, a literature of idols or a literature of awe.</page></plain_text>
