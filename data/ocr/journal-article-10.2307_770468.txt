I _ 1 11 : ? *:?:I x HUNTING RELIEF FROM A TOMB AT SAKKARA, EGYPTIAN, SIXTH DYNASTY (circa 2600 B. C.) Recently acquired by the Worcester Art Museum THE ARCHAIC SMILE "to be an original enlargement of an artist's experience a work of art must be called forth by the service of religion or some consciously held idea of art." By FRANCIS HENRY TAYLOR Director, Worcester Museum FIFTY years ago archaic sculpture was known only as a curious phenomenon. It was assumed that all primitive peoples made statues in much the same spirit in which children make mud pies. No one but archaeologists-antiquarians and numismatists they were called then-bothered to look at these barbaric efforts in stone and clay. It was discovered that savages worked in bronze. German professors with large watch chains and scrubby beards began. to collect hair pins and cooking utensils. Civil servants with gaping mouths and pith helmets learned that their. preferment depended upon the number of ancient curiosities they forwarded to the British Museum. The boulevardier, who seldom left Paris and who never went beyond Marseilles, was possibly the first to recognize their beauty. He pointed out moreover that these strange creations of the savage were not only very fine to look upon but that in some way they were intimately connected with his private life. And primitive art moved into the drawing room. Archaic sculpture is an art which belongs to that period of man's religious development when the idea is as important and as big as the forms which symbolize it. The experi- ence which the artist is living over again, forging out of his own passions, into new and broadened terms, is not photographic. It is architectonic. Like a new born baby, regardless of how awkward it may seem, it is nevertheless fully created, with definite re- lations between its parts; and, like the aver- age baby, it is remarkably self-contained. A smile appears on the faces of most archaic figures. It is not an accident of the sculptor's clumsiness nor is it a conscious effort of his skill to create in his figures a happiness of expression seeming to transcend that of human beings. To understand the smile one must turn to archaic scultpure it- self. The almond shaping of the eyes, widespread upon the forehead, thick ribbon lids, and shelving brows give an impersonal dignity to their regard. The eyes are superb and proud, not vacant. There is a complete</page><page sequence="2">- PARNA2SUbU - indifference to portraiture; a tranquility and resignation which one may sometimes observe upon the faces of dead persons. Not only in the treatment of the eyes are these elimina- tions apparent but in the nostrils as well; placed above coarse cubic lips they bring the flattened surfaces of the cheeks together be- tween definite nose and chin. The jaw bone continues the boundaries of a compact head set upon massive shoulders which are gradu- ally welded into an organic trunk, immobile and majestic. The figure is built up step by step from the base on which it stands and of which it is a part. Certainly the Greek of the sixth century B. C. did not observe such individuals in his daily life. Nor can one suppose these images to be the product of inferior execution. The fact that he did not attempt the por- traiture of those about him must not be laid to technical inability, but rather to a sense of consecration in himself. These figures are all of them immortal and, since he had not in- quired too closely into the personality of his God, he was capable of creating an ideal representation of Him; a gen- eralization of a superman bearing none of the arresting peculiarities of indi- vidual persons. One might compare the so-called Apollo of Tenea in Munich, so typical of the tense, flat- sided heroes of Boeotia, with the later and still more famous Hermes of Praxiteles at Olympia to see the differ- ence in the spirit of their times. In the former we observe the arch-type of mankind, not necessarily Apollo (for his cult was in its infancy) but cer- tainly a God. The tomfoolery of Olympus had not yet been established and the enigma of man's relation to the Infinite is on his face. Hermes on the other hand is sweet and precious. In the little woodshed of a museum the Greeks have built around him at Olympia, Oxford men write sonnets to him and spinsters wipe away their tears. But he is ever Hermes, the son of Maia and guardian of the infant Dionysius. He is Hermes with all his emblems of individuality which Praxiteles, another individual, put upon him and therefore he lacks the universal qualities which belong to cultus statues of an earlier age. Every civilization has had its great period of archaic sculpture. In Egypt under the Memphite kings the Sphinx, whose smile is perhaps the greatest riddle of antiquity, was carved. Never has a people produced an art more instinct with dignity and reverence. A statue of the Pharaoh epitomizes not only the absolutism of his rank but the strangeness of his origin. Perhaps the Nile who bore him might explain the mystery of his smile, a transfixed but scarcely humorous expression of his deity. In the early periods of Egyptian art his identity is revealed in nearly every instance by an insignificant cartouche yet the solemnity of the convention is rarely dis- turbed by the desire for portraiture. This convention asserts itself in every art that de- lel development took place in Etruscan art; no visitor to the Villa Giulia in Rome will resist the suavity of the early figures or the happiness in the faces of the effigies which recline, half raised upon one arm, on their terra cotta tombs. Roman sculpture, how- ever, never knew an archaic period, for the Latin mind was too filled with actuality. Roman gods were as regularly codified as Roman law, and the people of the Empire were inspired by little else than the acquisition of property and the steps necessary to retain it. Every religious figure dedicated by a Roman citizen was a direct financial settle- ment with a divinity for a specific amount of grace or services rendered to the donor. Rome was the Chicago of antiquity and Roman law was based on the principle that it is better to buy off a god than to flatter him with prayer. Roman portraiture, despite the extravagant claims made in its behalf by British and German scholars during the past twenty-five years, sinks to a very low level of the sculp- tor's art. It bears to archaic Greek art the spiritual relation that Frank Duveneck bears to Rembrandt. A powerful expression of the commonplace is all that may be said of rived anything of its inspiration from the Egyptian. In Assyria and Babylonia, in Chaldea and Cyprus, even in Crete and in the Aegean islands, the religious purposeful- ness of archaic art is combined with a stillness of the spirit which in itself denies the very existence of the individual who brought this conception into being. The sculptural procession in Greece we have already touched upon. In Italy a paral- it for a Roman portrait bust speaks only in the terms of the limitations of the individual, not of his potentialities. Romanesque art, on the other hand, is Romanesque religion. The sense of contract between man and his Creator had been lack- ing in the earlier centuries of the Church. The worship of the catacombs was a grovel- ling affair, a brave attachment to a cause which defied the horrors of its persecution and the hardships of its mission. Man had little time to speculate upon his relation to his divine author. Even the cleric, the most enlightened man of the day, was too busy carrying on the daily life of the Church to burden his mind with metaphysic. The year 1000 brought about a change in his point of view. Modern scholarship to the contrary, it was a convenient date at which the world might end. Just as we prefer round numbers today, so did they then, and the Christian people prepared themselves for judgment. But strangely enough the world kept on and the spirit of inquiry which this excitement had provoked was directed into the pathway of monastic reform. During the XIth and XIIth centuries a wave of religious emotion swept over Europe. The Cluniac reform, of which St. Bernard of Clairvaux was as much a result as he was its pro- tagonist, brought about an intimacy between the monk and his Christ, the monk and the Blessed Virgin, which the European had not known since the anthropomorphic religions of primitive times. Sheltered from the world, and a wild uncouth place it was then, if we may believe the chronicles, the monk gave up his life to the contem- plation of his God. Although to the medieval man the details of Jesus' life were almost a commonplace, the in- dividuality of Christ was not that of a mythological hero. For the generality of His position as Saviour of mankind was uppermost in the medieval mind. He was not only Jesus of Nazareth but the ideal of redemption as well, just as His mother was the Mother of all living in her dual role of wife to Joseph and Mother of the Son of God. It is just this bigness of conception which was needed to produce Romanesque sculpture and it is why in this sculpture we find those qualities, even to the smile itself, which abound in the archaic art of every civiliza- tion. Gloria was the word associated with these decorated portals, and it was the glory of the Court of Heaven. The skeleton plan for these arrangements was laid out in the cloister and passed on by means of manu- script illumination to the stone-cutter. But nothing was lost in the transmitting of the idea, for sharing to some degree the fervor of his monastic brother, the artist thought in the large and carried out his program without reflecting in it his own personality. This anonymity may account for the consciousness in medieval art which enabled the craftsman to rise above the limits of an established iconography through the infusion of truths ARCHAIC HEAD FROM CYPRUS In the Metropolitan Museum of Art . .... ...... .

Monsieur Elie Faure has said that whenever voluntary sacrifice of the artist to -his work of art is found, then that art may be considered truly medieval or archaic. It matters little what term is used, for in the final analysis it represents merely the artistic expression of a genuine religious period through which every people passes. So many parallels have been observed be- tween Buddhism and Christianity that it is not surprising to find a similar relation be- tween the monastic art of China and that produced by such communities in the West. The famous rock-hewn caves at Yiin Kang approach very much in spirit the ideals set forth at Avallon or Vezelay and the great west front of Chartres. As filled with anec- dote and philosophy as that of Christ, the life of Buddha lent itself to ascetic contem- plation. It has even been suggested that the parable of the Lotus flower pushing its way up through the mire may be considered inalagous to the mystery of virgin birth. Certainly the most vigorous plastic expression that we know in China took place during the Six Dynasties, the moment when the legend of the life of Buddha was introduced from India. Not yet was the Buddhist hierarchy irrevocably defined and the sculptor or fresco painter put into his figures much of his own experience. Since this experience was reli- gious and emotional, the sculpture and paint- ing could not fail to take on that impalpable quality which we have seen inherent in all archaic art, and which was wholly lacking in the colder and more classic figures of Gand- hara. To enumerate the other places and periods where this archaic circumstance occurs would be to prepare a catalogue of some ethnological museum. For the Mayan and Aztec, and, in fact, all the primitive cultures of the his living God as God, and the smile which we see upon his face is a translation into stone or wood of his reconciliation with the Infinite. To anyone who has so much as cast a tourist's glance at an archaic figure, the elaboration of this theme will seem the vilest platitude. But there is a significance to the archaic phenomenon which we have a tendency to overlook simply because archaic art has always, so far as we are concerned, been a product of the past. The fact that its simple qualities are so appealing to the individualists of the XXth century is worthy of closer consideration. It means obviously enough that we are lacking-more than that, we are starved for-universals. The best artists of our day may have a conventional sort of studio discipline that tells them what colors they may not place side by side and which, therefore, makes their shocking ex- periments all the more amusing. They are, except for a certain determined exhibitionism, in themselves utterly without purpose. It is important that we find some truth in art, some experential truth, which is as true as the Gods which have motivated religious art in the past. The past fifty years have brought a variety of fresh influences into the field of criticism. In painting and sculpture a revolution has taken place, not against the verities of which fine art is composed, but against the prostitu- tion to which it has been condemned in recording events and scenes which have no artistic merit in themselves. Sensible criti- cism has been the invaluable ally in revolt. For the critic, enlarging his experience through his contact with scientific thought, has found authority.in the past upon which the artist may base truths equally self-evident today. The procedure of the artist, unlike that of the mathematician, is strictly em- pirical. He is creating out of experience. Consequently there can never be wholly new ideas. A new movement at most is a return to a simpler expression of an already existing fact-a reaction against the dissipations of more recent technique. Dissipations of the mind in art are quite as engaging as dissipations of the flesh and are, in fact, much more closely allied than people will today admit. The eye is the most fickle of our senses, and paradoxically, being our weakest member governs both our minds and our bodies. It may be attracted by some object or group of objects badly composed, without form, and utterly lacking in aesthetic merit. For example, the luscious red lips of the girl on the magazine cover, rendered so photographically upon canvas, betray us into thinking the man who painted them a true artist. There is the pitfall of all craftsmen as well as critics, and, to pro- duce original art, we must produce something more than evocative representations of things which we have touched with our fingers. Primitive man had something very vital to express about his religious life, but at the same time disciplined his feelings with a fine sense of decorative values. Combining these two instincts, he was capable of producing a great art, an enlargement of his own experi- ence, and it was motivated by that spiritual consciousness so sadly lacking in the non- religious representation of the present day. Mr. Wilenski, in his distinguished essay, "The Modern Movement in Art," has drawn the nice distinction between religious and non-religious art. And it is in his definition of the modern movement, "to regain a creative consciousness both in the artist and the spec- tator," that the value of his book lies. Religious art he leaves aside, for he realizes that any art which is votive is original and consciously conceived. It is rather toward Americas and of the Oceanic world we find similar de- velopments. Afri- can Negro sculp- ture, so popular today for its "ab- stractions," offers a splendid field of study since it is the most recent primi- tive art that we know and because also our long asso- ciation with the negro's mind as we see him in America (not so very far removed from his brother in Benin or Camerunia) gives us an understanding of this art which otherwise we might not grasp.

The Catholic Mass has preserved to some degree the physical forms and bodily reverences which man has always associated with his God. And, even in the Church itself, the modernists have tried to shame the faithful into forsaking relics and other concrete expressions of their belief. Except for the Jesuit philosophers, who found in Baroque architecture a channel into which they could direct the emotions of their congregations, Catholic art would have died out. Their effort at best was casuistry and, although there was a revival for a few years, the impetus was not sufficient to give new substance to the movement. Catholic art be- came Catholic practice, not Catholic religion, such as it had been in the vigor of the XIIth century, and today the artistic expression of the Church is limited to empty copies of the works of its fine periods. It was not, then, the artist who failed the Church, but it was the Church-and the word is here used in its broadest sense to include all Christendom-which failed the artist. The tendency among historians has been to blame the Reformation for retarding the progress which the artist had apparently made in the period that we call the Renais- sance. The blame cannot, however, be put upon the shoulders of the Puritans for how can we account for the fact that in the XVIIIth century the arts virtually died out in the two most Catholic countries with Tiepolo and Goya. The growing spirit of nationalism, a natural reaction against the individualistic patronage of the condottiere, was more likely the agent provocateur. There were produced a succession of court styles, all of them based upon a pseudo-classical foundation, which differed in each state in the manner best calculated to increase the prestige of a particular sovereign. The Church also began to subdivide its allegiance for, during the XVIIIth and XIXth centuries, the question of Church and State became one that each nation had to settle for itself with little enough regard for the wishes of the Vatican. The Papal States were reduced to a minimum and, while the priests continued to look to Rome for their ordinations, the universal conviction that had belonged to the medieval Church had disintegrated. As the years of the grand siecle rolled on toward the Revolution, this state of affairs became apparent to the people. For, if the French king had been able to say "apres moi le diluge," the court painter at Versailles realized that his opportunity was momentary and distinctly of this world. He had little concern for the Infinite and still less for the immediate future. What was suitable for Philip the Catholic was not, obviously, to the taste of the Prince of Orange. He must flatter the absolute monarch even if he him- self be at heart a stout republican with no faith in the divine right of kings. The portrait offered him the greatest avenue for such servile attentions, attentions which soon assumed a national character. And to this patriotic impulse we must attribute the fop- pery and flashing satins of the English school. Emotionally the artist was sterile. He had long ago ceased to have any personal belief to translate into stone or canvas. If his subject were a religious one he did not try to express his own relations with his God, but described his priest's instead. He had lost the sense of awe and wonder which gave such vigor to the primitive painter, and yet he was developing in his craft a technical facility far beyond his discernment as a scientific thinker. He consequently ceased to enlarge his reading of life and produced an This "consciously held idea of art" is in itself a religion of the most poignant and dynamic force. The spectator cannot fail to recognize its influence stamped on the works of a man who has once felt it. Should he doubt its sincerity on its face value, he need only turn to the documentary evidence.

That there were individual geniuses and talents in this sea of mediocrity is, of course, the exception that proves the rule. One has but to mention a single name and a hundred others come instantly to the mind; artists, too, who had a message as great as that of their primitive ancestors. It might, there- fore, be urged that religious belief was but a single point of view in the history of the world's aesthetic truths. But, as Mr. Wilen- ski has pointed out, the important works of art that have been produced since the Renais- sance have all been "called forth either by religion or by some consciously held idea of art." men who believed ringing with conviction. Delacroix's Journal, Cezanne's confessions to Zola, even Courbet's gospel of realism have the same fanatical self-revelation. To create a man must give himself; and if he gives himself, he must believe. The artist today does not believe any more than does his public. We have analyzed human emotions to the point that nothing is sacred to us. The words "love" and "cherish" have passed from our vocabulary. We are so afraid of a genuine emotion that we have classified our feelings into psycho- logical and physiological reactions. We have claimed every political and economic alibi that we can think of to account for our inability to produce great art-abstractions, sur-realism-and yet we cannot get away</page><page sequence="5">- PARNASSU, 5 from the realization that we have failed just as we have failed in our human relations. The contributions of our generation, such as they are, have been surface remedies because we have lacked the courage to attack the real problems. For example, in the Matisse exhibition we have recently had an opportunity to observe almost every phase in the mental development of a great decorator. Yet his contributions have been more technical than creative. He has recalled with magnificant emphasis the possibilities of color pattern. But where is there in his work the driving powerful generality of Cezanne? No single picture in the exhibition is greater than the man him- self. With Picasso we are torn between the monumental sincerity of the young man and the charlatanism of the successful painter. In Germany and America the temple of the Muse can scarcely be approached for the chauvinistic underbrush of native fruits and flowers. We have raised up an Olympus on the bulwarks of the XIXth century, but it is peopled with minor divinities. The sculptors, more than the painters, have realized the absurdity in the theory of art for art's sake. Maillol, Kolbe, Lehm- bruck, Despiau, even the romantic Bourdelle and the modish Mestrovic have breathed the air of economy that has been blowing since the Salon of 1876. It is an e'conomy of line, a depth of volume and profundity of color so pertinent to the design that the spectator recognizes at once its truth measured in the THE APOLLO OF VEII Etruscan Museum, Villa Giulia, Rome ::X X:::i terms of his own experience. Of such stuff is archaic art conceived and that these sculp- tors recognized it is due probably to the fact that while "Les Fauves" were busy being the smart young men of Paris, the marble cutters were watching what the archaeologists were digging up at Delphi and at Delos. They realized that it is impossible to carve an easel statue so they were content to submit to the discipline of architecture. Discipline then is what we need, the dis- cipline of mathematics or one of its de- pendent expressions such as architecture, music or geometry. This will release us from the burden of originality which is the bane of every self-supporting artist. If he may develop through the conscious application of these axioms, a belief in something more universally true than his own sense im- pressions, he will leave behind him a work of art that will meet the standards of genera- tions other than his own. Mr. Walter Lipp- mann's suggestion of a new business ethics, in his "Preface to Morals," may, if he be right, presage a new iconography. The day of individualism as a political expression is done and, if we may judge from the exhibi- tions of the past ten years, it seems a little worn out as an artistic inspiration. If only the depression would prick our vanity to the point of giving us a new faith and a new iconography, then at last we might have a new art in which the archaic quality would smile at the hustle and bustle of Fifty-seventh Street.
