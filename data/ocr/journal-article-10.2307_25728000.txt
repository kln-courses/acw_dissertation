<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews The Noble Qur'an: A New Rendering of Its Meaning in English. Translated by Abdalhaqq and Aisha Bewley. Pp. 651. Norwich: Madina Press / Bookwork, 1420 / 1999. This new translation of the Qur'an immediately outdates all others in the English speaking world. The result of over twenty-five years of detailed study of the Qur'anic text, the Bewley translation has the advantage of high quality, naturally fluent English, along with the benefits of access to the traditional understanding of the text as expressed in the standard medieval tafsirs. (The translators note in particular the works of Ibn Juzayy, al-Qur ubi and al-Qadi Abu Bakr ibn al-cArabi, as well as the Hashiya of al-Sawi on the Jalalayn.) The Bewleys have kept annotation to a minimum as they have also avoided interpolation. They have, rather, in every instance tried to allow the basic Qur'anic message to speak for itself in clear, modern English, even if that sometimes means allowing certain judicious departures from the original gram mar and/or literal meaning of the text. And they have succeeded admirably in their aim. Thus there are none of the extensive annotations and/or interpolations charac teristic of some existing translations (much as these might be useful if the intention is to produce a tafsir in English), but rather what one can only describe as an inspired understanding and rendering of the text. The following example is just one among many that could be chosen to illustrate the above (see also the selections at the end of this review): Q. 14:43 (=14:45 in this text) - muhti?lna muqnici ru'iisihim la yartaddu ilayhim tarfuhum wa-af idatuhum hawa'un - is translated by Sale (1734) as: they shall hasten forward, at the voice of the angel calling to judge ment, and shall lift up their heads; they shall not be able to turn their sight from the object whereon it shall be fixed, and their hearts shall be void of sense, through excessive terror. and by Palmer (1880) as: Hurrying on, raising up their heads, with their looks not turned back to them, and their hearts void; Pickthall (1930) has: As they come hurrying on in fear, their heads upraised, their gaze returning not to them, and their hearts as air.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 83 while Yusuf CAH (1934) has: They running forward With necks outstretched, Their heads uplifted, their gaze Returning [sic] towards them, And their hearts a (gaping) void. and al-Hilali and Muhsin Khan (1974) have: (They will be) hastening forward with necks outstretched, their heads raised up (towards the sky), their gaze returning not towards them and their hearts empty (from thinking because of extreme fear). In the present translation we find the much more immediate: rushing headlong - heads back, eyes vacant, hearts hollow. The main features of this translation are noted by the translators in their brief but comprehensive preface. Firstly, they have used a 'free-verse' rather than extended prose format (except in the case of Surat Yiisuf[QA2] where for the most part iambic pentameters are used, and used very effectively) in order to represent the breaks in the original and enable the reader to gain some idea, through 'the natural rhythms of the English language' (iv), of the rhythms of the original text. Secondly, certain key terms, such as 'kafir', 'mushrik', 'mumin', etc, have been retained in their Arabic form and without italicisation. Some readers may at first react to this, but it will soon become clear that there is great wisdom in this choice, for it allows the Qur'an to speak directly to the reader without the meaning being cluttered up by interpretation and/or the false associations of many English equivalents. Indeed, these terms are pre cisely those that get used in all 'Muslim' languages, such as Hausa, Urdu and Malay. As the translators note, exactly the same phenomenon has occurred with English so that English speaking Muslims have assimilated into the language various Arabic words which are either untranslatable or words whose English equivalents have become so imbued with a meaning other than that intended by the original Arabic that to use them would be to mislead rather than give the correct significance, (iv) Another refreshing feature of this translation is that the translators have consciously chosen the Madinan reading of Warsh from Nafic as their basic text rather than the more familiar (to most) Kufan reading of Hafs fromc Asim. Similarly, the verse-num bering follows the Madinan numbering system rather than the more frequently found</page><page sequence="3">84 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Kufan system. This at the very least should serve to remind readers that there is not just one reading of the Qur'an (or just one system of verse-numbering), and that the Qur'an was revealed in such a way that certain differences were part and parcel of the revelation right from the beginning and were thus retained by the Muslim communi ty in the form of the different readings, whether one chooses to restrict these to Seven, Ten or even Fourteen Readings (or more). Some will also recognise that the reading of Nafic is not just one among Seven (or Ten, or Fourteen) Readings. Rather, as Imam Malik noted: The reading of Nafic is sunna\ and thus represents the norm of Qur'anic recitation (at least, in Madina in Malik's own time) rather than any excep tion to it. One further point is noted in the preface, and that is that, in general, anthropomorphic expressions relating to Allah's 'face', 'hands', 'eyes', etc., have been retained in the English as they are in the Arabic. This has not been a problem for most non-Muslim translators, who simply say 'face', etc., without any need for commentary, but some Muslim translators have felt it necessary in certain instances either to 'adjust' the translation or add further comment. Thus in Q.2:114 [=Q.2:115 in the Kufan num bering system] the Bewleys have: Both East and West belong to Allah, so wherever you turn, the Face of Allah is there. Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing. which accords with the use of 'face' in Sale's: To God belongeth the east and the west; therefore, withersoever ye turn yourselves to pray, there is the face of God; for God is omnipresent and omniscient. and Palmer's: God's is the east and the west, and wherever ye turn there is God's face; verily, God comprehends and knows. Pickthall, however, prefers: Unto Allah belong the East and the West, and whithersoever ye turn, there is Allah's countenance. Lo! Allah is All-Embracing, All Knowing. while Yusuf ?Ali has: To Allah belong the East And the West: whithersoever</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 85 Ye turn, there is the Presence Of Allah. For Allah is All-Pervading, All-Knowing and al-Hilall and Khan have: and to Allah belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn (your selves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne). Surely! Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knowing. In this connection one might also note the numerous instances where the preposition cinda has been translated, quite naturally and correctly in this reviewer's opinion, by what could be considered the anthropomorphic expression of 'in the sight of, e.g. 'That is the best thing for you in your Maker's sight' (Q.2:53 [=54, Kufan number ing]), '... far more serious in the sight of Allah' (Q.2:215 [=217, Kufan numbering]), 'That is better for him in his Lord's sight' (Q.22:28 [=30, Kufan numbering]), etc. Finally, in order to give a taste of the qualities of this translation, I leave the reader with a few short extracts. Space does not permit extensive quotation, and choosing representative samples from a text of this length is not an easy matter. Nevertheless, the following three examples will, I hope, give some idea of the lucidity and imme diacy of the translation, while at the same time illustrating typical Madinan (Example 1) and Makkan (Examples 2 and 3) material: 1. Q.3:58-66 [=59-67, Kufan numbering] The likeness of cIsa in Allah's sight is the same as Adam. He created him from earth and then He said to him, 'Be!' and he was. It is the truth from your Lord so do not be among the doubters. If anyone argues with you about him after the knowledge that has come to you, say, 'Come then! let us summon our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves. Then let us make earnest supplication and call down the curse of Allah upon the liars.' This is the true account: there is no other god besides Allah.</page><page sequence="5">86 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Allah - He is the Almighty, the All-Wise. And if they turn away, Allah knows the corrupters. Say, 'People of the Book! come to a proposition which is the same for us and you - that we should worship none but Allah and not associate any partners with Himl and not take one another as Lords besides Allah.' If they turn away, say, 'Bear witness that we are Muslims.' 'People of the Book! why do you argue concerning Ibrahim when the Torah and Injil were only sent down after him? Why do you not use your intellect? You are people arguing about something of which you have no knowledge. Why do you argue about something of which you have no knowledge? Allah knows; you do not know.' Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian but a man of pure natural belief - a Muslim. He was not one of the mushrikun. 2. Q.54:l-22 The hour has drawn near and the moon has split. If they see a Sign they turn away, saying 'There is no end to this witchcraft!' They have denied the truth and followed their whims and desires, but everything has its time. News has come to them which contains a threat: consummate wisdom - but warnings are profitless. Turn away from them then. On the Day the Summoner summons them to something unspeakably terrible, they will emerge from their graves with downcast eyes, like swarming locusts,</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 87 necks outstretched, eyes transfixed, rushing headlong to the Summoner. The kuffar will say, 'This is a pitiless day!' Before them the people of Nuh denied the truth. They denied Our slave, saying, 'He is a madman,' and he was driven away with jeers. He called upon his Lord: 'I am overwhelmed, so help me!' So We opened the gates of heaven with torrential water and made the earth burst forth with gushing springs. And the waters met together in a way which was decreed We bore him on a planked and well-caulked ship, which ran before Our eyes - a reward for him who had been rejected. We left it as a Sign. But is there any rememberer there? How terrible were My punishment and warnings! We have made the Qur'an easy to remember. But is there any rememberer there? 3. Q.81 When the sun is compacted in blackness, when the stars fall in rapid succession, when the mountains are set in motion, when the camels in foal are neglected, when the wild beasts are all herded together, when the oceans surge into each other, when the selves are arranged into classes, when the baby girl buried alive is asked for what crime she was killed, when the Pages are opened up, when the Heaven is peeled away, when the Fire is set ablaze,</page><page sequence="7">88 Journal of Qur'anic Studies when the Garden is brought up close: then each self will know what it has done. No! I swear by the planets with their retrograde motion, swiftly moving, self-concealing, and by the night when it draws in, and by the dawn when it exhales, truly it is the speech of a noble Messenger, possessing great strength, securely placed with the Lord of the Throne, obeyed there, trustworthy. Your companion is not mad. He saw him on the clear horizon. Nor is he miserly with the Unseen. Nor is it the word of an accursed Shaytan. So where, then, are you going? It is nothing but a Reminder to all the worlds, to whoever among you wishes to go straight. But you will not will unless Allah wills, the Lord of all the Worlds. YASIN DUTTON</page></plain_text>
