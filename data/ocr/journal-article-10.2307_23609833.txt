<plain_text><page sequence="1">GANDHIAN HUMANISM AND CONTEMPORARY CRISES* M.V. Naîdu Political Science, Brandon University, Brandon We are witnesses to a world of dangerous contradictions. While advances in science-technology have been generating unprecedented material wealth, millions are dying of hunger, disease and armed conflicts. Since World War II more than 100 wars have killed more than 60 million people in the Third World. Yet the world is now spending about $1000 billions annually on militarization while spending not more than a few millions on the starving children, the homeless refugees and on the environmental improvements. In the name of progress, neocolonial powers and the multinational corporations are exploiting the economic resources of the weak nations, and are financing racism, religious bigotry and jingoism. Promising national security, the industrial-military state has been generating greatest amount of insecurity by increasing the dangers of a nuclear war, economic disparities and chauvinistic antagonisms. While advocating human rights, the modern state has been reducing individual autonomy and human dignity. Two Sets of Crises: This world of contradictions has generated two sets of crises - one at the economic-political-military level; the other, at the psychological sociological-cultural level. * Based on the speech delivered at the symposium on "Mahatma Gandhi: Cross-Cultural Understanding and Contemporary Crises," held at the Law Centre, University of Alberta, on 30 September 1989 by the Mahatma Gandhi Canadian Foundation for World Peace. 41</page><page sequence="2">The crises at the first level are the products of the modern state that has arisen on the foundations of science-technology, industry, military, colonialism and media of mass communications. At the econo-politico military level, the modern state has generated the following contemporary crises: 1. Threats of nuclear annihilation; 2. Arms race and unending militarization; 3. Environmental destruction and dangers of industrial pollution; 4. Neocolonial exploitation and the calamities of failing developmentalism; 5. Authoritarian military-industrial state; 6. Scientific technological totalitarianism. All these factors are inter-connected, with science-technology forming the central factor. At the human level, the contemporary psycho-socio-cultural crises are the following: 1. Bigoted religionism; 2. Dehumanizing racism; 3. Jingoistic patriotism; 4. Suffocating authoritarianism; 5. Unscrupulous materialism; 6. Globalized brute militarism. All these factors are interlocked, with militarism constituting the central force. They represent human values, ideologies, attitudes and behaviours. The psycho-socio-cultural factors are inter-related with the econo-politico -military factors; they mutually interact, they are both the causes and the results at the same time. The two core elements in the two sets of factors - science-technology and militarism, together with industrialism, constitute the heart of the modern state. To meet the challenges of the contemporary crises and to win over the present dehumanising values, attitudes and behaviours, Gandhism proposes rehumanization through a new set of values, a different range of attitudes, a positive code of behaviours and a new methodology of social action for social change. In a word, Gandhism propounds a new humanism as the answer to solve the contemporary crises. I have already attempted elsewhere to tackle the economic-political military crises in the light of Gandhism.1 In this paper I shall limit myself to a discussion of the six contemporary values/ideologies in the light of Gandhian humanism. A few caveats are necessary in discussing Gandhism. 1. Though Gandhi's writings so far have run into 80 thick volumes, Gandhi was not an arm-chair intellectual or academic who theorized and wrote systematic treaties sitting in a library. He was history's greatest activist who mobilized 400 million disspirited persons to fight and defeat without weapons the most powerful British Empire. 2. In dealing with socio-political issues Gandhi, like a true social scientist, took certain hypotheses, operationalized them for mass 42</page><page sequence="3">participation, tested their validity, discarded the untenable and built upon the proven. Gandhian thinking must, therefore, be understood in the context of his activities and the circumstances involved. 3. To mobilize millions of ordinary people Gandhi had to build issues and design programmes that were simple yet revolutionary based on sources and vocabulary that was comprehensible to Indian masses. Gandhian terms, slogans and symbols were drawn from Indian mass culture based on religious texts, epics, mystics and musicians, sanyasis and saints. Sometimes Gandhi interpreted these sources in his own unconventional ways. Thus Gandhian allusions, allegories and interpretations should be properly understood in the context of Indian culture and through Gandhi's own eyes. Never before in history a handful of salt, or a simple wooden spinning wheel (charkha) or hand-spun course cotton cloth (Khadi) or nonviolence (ahimsa) had shaken a mighty empire. Contemporary Crises in Human Values: Let me briefly explain the six contemporary crises in human values that I have identified earlier. 1. Religionism: Religion, as defined in Western Culture and the English language has six ingredients:3 (1) a set of blind beliefs in supernatural elements like God, hell, heaven, dooms day, divine creation etc. (2) Blind belief in one particular man (women have been excluded from divine attribution) as "the son of God," or "the messenger of God" or as the only or the true or the last prophet sent by God. (3) Blind belief in one particular book as the source of divine revelations received by the prophet. (4) Blind faith in the priest or the minister or the rabbi or the Imam either as "the vicar" or the prophet, or the divinely-anointed or inspired interpreter of the divine will. (5) Total commitment to and reliance on the congregation of the believers, the Church organization that is based on to prosylatization and ex-communication. (6) Blind ritualism as the necessary instrument of identity, commitment, conformity and discipline among the believers. With its monopoly over the interpretation of the religious beliefs and of the divine will, the church presided over by the clergy, becomes the embodiment of the religion. Together the clergy, the church and the rituals establish religionism that transforms a religion like Christianity into churchianity. Religionism is thus built upon blind and irrational faith in certain fundamental unquestionable assumptions that must be accepted as the final, absolute, universal and eternal truths. All other competing claims are therefore false, incorrect and unacceptable. Religionism, therefore, proposes that all such "false" claims must be banished, silenced or eradicated, if necessary through coercion and force - psychological, economic, political and physical; often the last is used first and most. 43</page><page sequence="4">Violence becomes the core of religionism. Heresy, blasphemy and apostasy are punishable within the society of believers, while crusade, jihad, or sacred war should be launched to defeat or punish the rival claimants. The phenomenon of religious terrorism of the Irish, of the jews, of the muslims, of the Hindus, of the Buddhists, and of the sikhs covering almost every continent, is the identifiable feature of religionism. Religionism assumes certain subtlety and invisibility when it is invoked in the name of a "Christian nation," a jewish state," an "Islamic country," "a Hindu nation," or "a Buddhist state." In short, religionism is the psychological-cultural factor that is based in irrationalism, dogmatism, fanaticism, intolerance and violence. Gandhism does not concede or condone such religionism. "If we are imperfect ourselves," wrote Gandhi, "religion as conceived by us must also be imperfect.... All faiths constitute a revelation of Truth, but all are imperfect, and liable to error . . .."4 2. Racism: Though based on physical visibility, racism ends up as a psychological-cultural factor. The physical attributes are associated with intelligence, emotions, aesthetics, religion, culture, economics and politics, as if the shape of the nose shapes intelligence, or the colour of the skin determines the political accumen or the nature of the hair indicates aesthetic sensibilities. These assumptions are absolutely irrational, totally unscientific and completely unrealistic. Often race becomes associated with territory - a white country, a black continent, the yellow orient, etc.. sometimes race gets mixed up with culture and becomes ethnicity. However irrational and unreal, racism seems to dominate all relationships on this earth. The contemporary world is dripping with blood of white racism, black racism, yellow racism, and anti-semitism. Invoking irrational fears, suspicions and prejudices, racism utilizes the instruments of terror, murder and liquidation. Racial genocides committed on the jews by the Nazi, on the Tibetans by the Chinese, on the Bangladeshis by the Pakistanis, on the various tribes of Africa and Latin America, constitute a cruel chapter of the contemporary history. Gandhism is the anti-thesis of racism. 3. Chauvinism: Emotional attachment and blind loyalty to a territory or a country or a state or a region leads to Chauvinism i.e., narrow-minded patriotism/nationalism. "Right or wrong, my country is right," "good or bad, my state is good," "moral or immoral, I support my nation" - these are the sentiments of chauvinism. When expressed through militarism or war mongering, chauvinism degenerates into jingoism. Most of the time, chauvinism is invoked in the name of external threats - cultural, economic, political or military. Chauvinism can be channelized 44</page><page sequence="5">either towards inward looking isolationism, or towards externalized aggression legitimized in the name of the state by the ruling dictator, junta or class. Humanitarian issues and humanistic considerations have no relevance, no significance or no attraction whatsoever for the all-pervasive chauvinism. The strongest weapons in the arsenal of chauvinism are religionism, racism, colonialism, commerce and trade, and weapons; these elements inevitably lead to and facilitate economic exploitation, political blackmail and military conflicts. Gandhism is opposed to chauvinism and jingoism. To Gandhism national liberation can only be a positive, constructive and non-violent phase leading to universalism and humanism. My patriotism is not exclusive; it is calculated not only not to hurt another nation, but to benefit all in the true sense of the word.51 would like to see India free and strong so that she may offer herself as a willing and pure sacrifice for the betterment of the world.6 4. Authoritarianism: The forces of industrialization, technologicali zation, militarization and monopolization have necessitated the processes of centralization of all authority and governmentalization of all human activities, thereby giving rise to a pyramidical hierarchical state in which all power - economic, technological, military, administrative, and political, is concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer people at the top echelons, who establish the authoritarian state.7 In such a state, authoritative decisions come downwards, compliance moves upwards. To disallow protest and to demand compliance, the authoritarian rulers use instruments of control and coercion. These could be military, police or secret service systems, rewards and punishment schemes, thought control mechanism, propaganda or terror tactics. Sometimes non-governmental agencies like the family, school, church, mass medium, trade union, or political party are brought into play in the service of the authoritarian regime. Thought control and brain-washing are important tools. The authoritarian state aims at emptying the individual of his self-consciousness and will, and then turning him into a robotic compliance machine. This is the height of dehumanization that Gandhian philosophy totally rejects. 5. Materialism-Consumerism: The modern industrial society in the West has generated tremendous material wealth. To keep the machines and the factories going, this wealth has to be consumed. One technique for inducing consumption is the so-called builtin obsolescence. The other, is brain-washing on the joys of consumerism. While the mass media inculcates values and behaviours that glorify consumerism and self-indulgence, public education is used to spread the social philosophy that deifies materialism and industrialism; while the human being has been simply reduced to a mere consumer, human life has been reduced to the pursuit of a single goal - material affluence. Materialism and consumerism, in their turn, have generated greed and selfishness at the personal and the national levels, thereby leading to domestic economic battles, external colonialism, and inter-imperial wars. 45</page><page sequence="6">The growth of material wealth in the industrial state has been at the cost of impoverishment and exploitation of millions of peoples at the national and international levels. The former can be called domestic colonialism; the latter, external colonialism. "Industrialism," wrote Gandhi, "depends entirely on your capacity to exploit, on foreign markets being open to you, and on the absence of competition."8 European industrialization and material abundance is inconceivable without colonialism and imperialism. Empires became the suppliers of enormous quantities of raw materials, of energy sources, of cheap or slave labour, of captive consumers and of investment opportunities. Empires also supplied military power to conduct colonial wars. Third world countries, trying to shape themselves in the image of the industrial West have no colonies or empires to aid and sustain their industrialization. Hence the present calamities that are frustrating the peoples of the Third World.9 Gandhism propounds limits to materialism and consumerism by proposing limits to industrialization and end to colonialization. 6. Militarism: Militarism has two aspects: one, militarization, i.e., the gathering of arms and soldiers; the other, a value system and a mentality that venerates weapons and war and believes that (physical) force is the best and the most effective answer to all problems.10 The modern state in the West is the product of three elements - industrialization, militarization, and scienticization. Western industrializa tion has been dependent upon militarization and science-technology for its rise and development; Western science-technology is interlocked with industrialization and militarization; western militarization is inconceivable without industrialization and science-technology.11 To sustain unending militarization, the state has to create a rationale for it. Two kinds of rationalizations most commonly resorted to are - one, the fear of foreign intervention or aggression, and the other, the dream of imperial glory. The Stalinist scare of the "capitalist encirclement," and the "imperialist conspiracies" on the one hand, and the American fear of the "evil empire" and the anti-communist hysteria of McArthyism, on the other hand, shaped the entire cold war of the last four decades. The disproportionately high militarization of countries like Israel, Iraq, Iran, South Korea, Taiwan, South Africa, etc., has been rationalized on the argument of the very survival of the regime/nation.12 The British claim to the glory of Pax Británica, the Hitlerite slogan of "aryan supremacy," Mussolini's dream of recreating the past glories of the Roman Empire, the American claim to its "manifest destiny," and the Maoist adventurism in support of the so-called national liberation struggles, were all justification for attempts at empire-building. Israeli militarism combines both the fear for national security and the dream of Zionist expansionism for 46</page><page sequence="7">God's "chosen people." More often than not, militarism is the hand-maiden of religionism, racism, chauvinism, authoritarianism and materialism. In short, militarism is rooted in material greed and selfishness, in fears and insecurities, in intolerance and hate, and in the absolute belief in violence as the real and the only strength that guarantees security and success. Gandhism is the very opposite of militarism, and it rejects every element that inspires, sustains and expands militarism. The six psycho-socio-cultural crises of our time share certain common features: 1. Blind faith in monolithic irrational dogmas. 2. Psychology of intolerance, anger and hate. 3. Materialism built on the economic exploitation of the weak people and the generation of unsatiable material wants. 4. Immorality of greed and selfishness. 5. Authoritarianism based on centralization, hierarchy and thought control. 6. Commitment to violence as the best instrument for all the above. All the contemporary ideologies - fascism, communism, socialism and capitalism, subscribe to a lesser or a greater degree to the above six features. Through its methods and acts, every political system on earth has contributed to the rise and growth of the six crises of our time. Gandhian humanism is the only ideology that systematically and effectively rejects and undermines the power of these six appeals. Gandhian Humanism: Simply said, humanism means putting human wellbeing as paramount. Liberty, equality and fraternity can best protect human welfare. Any kind of discrimination or victimization of people on the basis of race, religion, place of birth, wealth or health would, therefore, be contradictory to humanism. Gandhism opposes any form of discrimination and violence, and proposes love and nonviolence. Thus Gandhian humanism is a much-needed antidote to the contemporary crises in human values and relations. Let me now examine the six basic elements in Gandhian humanism. These are - (1) Truth (Satya); (2) Love (Prema); and (3) Universal well being (Sarvodaya). For these three fundamental values of Gandhism, the two modalities of operation are - (4) Service (Seva) and (5) Nonviolence (Ahimsa). The methodology that combines the three values and the two modalities is (6) Nonviolent struggle (Satyagraha). Nonviolence is the central postulate for the other five elements of Gandhian humanism. Satya (Truth): Literally, satya in Sanskrit means truth. The concept of truth has been dealth with by theologians, metaphysicians, philosophers, logicians, scientists, and others. All religions claim the comprehension of the truth. They go further, and proclaim that they have the monopoly on the truth; all other claims to the 47</page><page sequence="8">truth are, therefore, false. On the basis of that absolute truth, every religion builds different categories of sub-truths. On the foundations of its fundamental premises, religion enunciates, advocates and implements its ideas and actions in all realms of life - politics, economics, culture, education and global relations. Thus the irrationality, the ignorance, the narrow-mindedness, the intolerance and the prejudices that are built into the fundamentals of religionism, shape and energize the personal, the social, the national, and the international policies and programmes of the religious believers. On similar lines the ideologies of racism, chauvinism, authoritarianism, materialism and militarism, are built upon irrational, unscientific and unquestioned fundamentals that shape the values, attitudes and behaviours of the votaries of those ideologies. What, then is the truth, according to Gandhism? "God is Truth"/"Truth is Cod." At one time Gandhi said that "God is truth." Even then Gandhi was not using the term God in the sense of the Judaic Jehova, the Christian God or the Islamic Allah. To these religions, God is personalized and anthropomorphic. That is, God is a Supreme (Male) Being presiding over the Heaven in the sky; he can be asleep or awake, he can be angry or pleased, he can be begged or bribed, he can be partial or punitive, he can be forgetful or revengeful, and so on. That is, God is seen in the image of man! Gandhi's God was more in the tradition of the Upanishads - a nameless, formless, supreme power or energy that cannot be comprehended by the finite being. "To me," said Gandhi, "God is Truth and Love; God is ethics and morality; God is fearlessness. God is the source of Light and Life . . ,."13 Before long, Gandhi realized that his choice of the phrase "God is truth," conveyed a theological concept of God, and could lead to misinterpretation of his philosophy. So he reversed his definition; he then stated: "Truth is God."14 Gandhi changed his theological conceptualization of truth into a philosophical and a logical definition of "the absolute." His transformation can be explained in the following way. If truth, by definition, is infinity, then how can it be comprehended by finite beings? If the human being is only a part of the universe, then how can the part perceive the whole? If human comprehension is only relative to his reality and experience, then how can the human being have the knowledge of the absolute? Though humans cannot comprehend the infinity, the absolute, the omnipotent, and the eternal, they can conceptualize and hypothesize truth. According to one philosophical definition, truth is the hypothetical absolute of universal validity;15 according to others, truth is a logical concept of the First Cause, the grund norm, or a mathematical concept of infinity. Hypothesis is the beginning of all scientific investigation and 48</page><page sequence="9">experimentation that may prove or disprove the hypothesis. If the hypothesis can be rejected or altered, then, the hypothesis, by definition, cannot be called the truth. Shaped by human limitations and experiences, the content and the quality of human conceptualization may vary from person to person, from place to place and from time to time. In other words, all human knowledge and understanding is subjective, relative and tentative. If this is true, how then can we consider human concepts of truth, as the truth or the absolute truth or the eternal truth? If all human beings have the same capacity and the same right to conceptualize truth, then we can have a variety of concepts of the same truth. Until proven wrong, all these concepts of truth must be assumed to be equally valid. So monolithic approach to the concept of truth is patently absurd. Pluralistic approach to truth would require willingness to examine all concepts of truth. Such consideration would necessitate tolerance and sympathetic understanding. Hence the need to constantly question human knowledge and to improve and refine it through endless search for truth. Would not endless search or limited knowledge lead to skepticism and cynicism? However tentative or incomplete a scientific principle may be, scientists keep working on the basis of that principle until and unless it is challenged by new experiments and new derivations. So every scientific truth is truth until it is disproved. The realization that human knowledge moves within the parameters of constancy and change, and within fixation and flexibility, should retain our dynamism in the search for truth. If all human knowledge is subjective, relative and tentative, how then can any religion or ideology claim the absolute truth? Or condemn others who make similar claims? Or attack those who contend that humans cannot comprehend the absolute truth? Further, if humans are capable of only conceptualizing truth, then there should be a variety of concepts of truth that could be conflicting. Are all the concepts of truth correct? Perhaps not! Are all the concepts of truth wrong? Perhaps not! Hence the need to constantly examine the concepts of truth, so that the unproven could be discarded, the convincing could be incorporated and the existing ones could be improved and refined. In the words of Gandhi: All faiths constitute a revelation of truth, but all are imperfect and liable to error.. .. We must be keenly alive to the defects of our faith ... we would not only not hesitate but would think it our duty to adopt into our faith every acceptable feature of other faiths.15A This endless process of improving our perceptions of truth demands an open-mind, a willingness to understand others' concepts, and a readiness to change, and to accept new proofs of truth without ill-will, without bitterness and without violence. This is the Gandhian approach to truth. 49</page><page sequence="10">Modem religionism, racism, chauvinism, authoritarianism, materialism and militarism are indeed antithetical to truth, because they venerate, propagate and perpetuate untruths, and are opposed to seeking truth. How can the rational votaries of truth be dogmatic and fanatic about their own concepts? How can they be intolerant, unsympathetic, and destructive of others' concepts of truth? Prema (Love): Search for truth requires an open-mind. Preconceived bias or prejudice, suspicion or fear, hate or anger close up the mind. Nothing new or different can enter a prejudiced mind. Empathy or sympathy open up the gates of a closed mind. If we assume that the other person is ignorant, stupid, unthinking, sinful, cursed or damned, then we will naturally refuse to hear his/her views. Respect for the other person's knowledge, thinking and goodness can prompt us to pay attention to that person's beliefs or views. Respect and empathy are the starting premises of open-mindedness. When we are openminded, we are prepared to hear, to listen and to understand. Understanding can lead us to admiration and appreciation. Appreciation is the perception of beauty. Beauty attracts. Sincere appreciation and attraction lead to "liking." When liking becomes intensified it crystallizes into "love" - Prema!. Thus beauty perception and appreciation can lead to Prema. Prema can function on person-to-person, or group-to-group levels. Love has been variously identified. To Aristotle, it was friendship; to Francis of Assissi, it was compassion; to the French revolutionists, it was fraternity; to the sociologists, it is affiliation (nonalienation); to the psychologist, it is belongingness; to the patriot, it is patriotism; to the modern societies, it is community-consciousness. To Gandhi, "God is love," and "truth is love." Love plays a crucial role in the Gandhian scheme of humanism. When you want to find Truth as God," writes Gandhi, "the only inevitable means is Love, ie., nonviolence, and since I believe that ultimately the means and the end are convertible terms, I should not hesitate to say that God is Love."16 Sarvodaya (Universal Well-being): Gandhian humanism has a special demand on love. Love for one should not mean hate for another. Love for one's group should not mean dislike for the outsiders. Human love should not be determined or demarcated by religious adherance, racial ties, political loyalties, materialist selfishness or militaristic alliances. If I admire the beauty of the Rocky mountains in Alberta, I should also be able to admire the beautiful Rockies in California, or the Alps in Switzerland, or the Urals in Russia or the Himalayas in India. If I love my Canadian neighbour because he is a good man, then I should have no difficulty in loving the good human beings who happen to be Americans, Russians or Chinese; who happen to be white, black or yellow? Who happen to be Christians, Jews or Muslims; who are the inheritors of wealth or victims of poverty; or who are militarily strong or physically handicapped! Today human lives are highly interdépendant - at the levels of the family, Cont. on p. 51. 50</page><page sequence="11">Cont. from p. 50. society, nation and the world. Our interdependency is like a three legged race with our partner; we want to win the race! If my partner is ill while I am healthy, if the partner is starving while I am well fed, if I am big and strong while my partner is unequal to me, and if I am free to run while my partner's legs are tied; how can we run and how can we win? How can I run and how can I win this three-legged race? What can wealth buy or sell in the markets of the poor? How can economic development of a few continue amidst widespread poverty of the many? How can we enjoy our freedom when our potential partners are enslaved in chains? How can equality within a minority make sense, when that minority has to deal with the majority that is condemned to inequality? How can the physically powerful get thrills of victories over the disabled, over the dying or over the dead? In today's world of intense interdependencies, our well being is very much dependent upon the well-being of many others (sarvodaya). This axion of sarvodaya that implies coexistence and coprosperity has become much more crucial and critical in the contemporary context than ever before in history. We have only one choice left - coexistence or codestruction! Gandhian sarvodaya postulates a fundamental premise of humanity's coexistence. Seva (Service): If hate is uncaring and destructive of its targets, true love is giving and caring for the ones we love. Love makes us better human beings because it helps us conquer our ego and banish our greed and selfishness. Love ennobles us when we learn to share and sacrifice. Caring, sharing and sacrificing is seva i.e., serving the ones we love. Love without service is lip service, an empty slogan; service without love is just a mechanical duty out of discipline. True love blossoms forth through service. "The test of love," Gandhi said, "is tapasya and tapasya means self-suffering."17 According to Gandhi, "voluntary service of others demands the best of which one is capable, and must take precedence over service of self."18 Because service is the operational mode for love, service should be unconditional. That is, it is not conditional to reward and recognition. It should remain unknown and unhonoured. Bhagavad Gita prescribes service without any desire for compensation. According to an old Urdu saying one must "do a good deed and drop in the river." The tragedy of our time is that all our human relations have been commercialized. We are taught to believe that every act we perform for others must be motivated by a desire for compensation, incentive, gain or reward, but not by the urgings of love. In commercial lingo we are constantly reminded - "don't expect something for nothing." This business value emphasizes "taking" rather than "giving;" it focuses upon "rights" rather than "duties." This capitalist ethic has penetrated deep into our psyche, into every thought we think, and into every move we make. It seems to prompt everybody - the mother and the children, the teacher and the pupil, the 51</page><page sequence="12">employer and the employee, the administrator and the subordinates, the politician and the public, the minister and his congregation and so on. When the expected compensation is not received, the doer or the giver is disappointed, frustrated and angry. The receiver faces the wrath of the giver's frustration. The relationship between the giver and the receiver is embittered. Both suffer; both are unhappy. I cannot be my brother's keeper simply because I don't love him. Only my love for him could prompt me to think of serving him selflessly without expecting a reward. Unselfish service is the manifestation of true love; as such, service becomes the lover's obligation. If everyone were serving out of love, then there would be no expectations of rewards. Without expectations, there would be no disappointments; without disappointments, there would be no frustrations, no anger and no bitterness. Life could be smooth, inspiring and satisfying. If each human being could become a true lover, he/she will feel the self-imposed duty to protect, to serve, to nourish and cherish the person one loves, without making demands or claiming rights. Gandhi, therefore, emphasized duties, not rights. If everyone carried out his duties, then rights of all can be protected and guaranteed without being demanded.19 Gandhi laid great emphasis on service that he called "constructive programme." He expected all his followers to take some part in this programme, which he considered the other side of the coin of satyagraha. Gandhian Constructive Programme consisted of the following projects: communal (religious) unity; removal of untouchability; prohibition; khadi industries; village sanitation; basic education; uplift of women; education in health and hygiene; development of provincial and the national language (Hindustani); economic equality; uplift of the peasantry, the working class and the tribals; care of the lepers; and improvement of cattle.20 Ahimsa (Nonviolence): Simply said, violence (himsa) is use of physical force to destory things or to hurt or harm or kill human beings. But the human action of inflicting physical destruction or pain, is the climactic stage which is preceeded by the stage of psychological and emotional motivation roused by frustration or fear, intolerance or impatience, and hate or anger. Thus violence can by psychological and physical. On the contrary, nonviolence (ahimsa) is the absence of spite and force, and the presence of love and service! If search for truth requires tolerance and empathy, if love is the process of appreciation and liking, if unconditional service is the manifestation of love, and if the wellbeing of all is a precondition for our own wellbeing, then human happiness cannot be attained through greed or selfishness, through hate or fear, or through force or firearms, which are in fact, the various manifestations of violence. Thus true love, service and general welfare are built on the foundations of nonviolence (ahimsa). Nonviolence is the means 52</page><page sequence="13">for the attainment of truth and love. Emphasizing the close link between the means and the end, Gandhi said, "The means may be likened to a seed, the end to a tree .. ,."21 Because the means determine the end, and because the medium becomes the message, nonviolence is both the means and the end, both the medium and the message. Gandhi wrote, As the means so the end. There is no wall of separation between the means and the end .... Realization of the goal is in exact proportion to that of the means. This is a proposition that admits of no exception.22 Starting with the idea of nonviolence as a means, Gandhi ended up by proclaiming that nonviolence is both the means and the end merged into one. He thus equaled truth and nonviolence, love and nonviolence, truth-love and nonviolence. He enunciated the "sovereignty of ahimsa." Satyagraha (Nonviolent Struggle): Gandhian concepts of satya, prema, sarvodaya, seva and ahimsa are prescriptions for long range and lasting eradication of contemporary crises. But how are immediate struggles to be launched to initiate the radical reforms necessary? The Gandhian proposition is the nonviolent struggle which he calls satyagraha. Literally, satya is truth, "graha" is to hold on; satyagraha is holding on to truth or morality or justice. In other words, satyagraha is the struggle to find truth and justice, or to hold on to truth and justice while resisting nonviolently, untruths and injustices in any situation. Sometimes Gandhi calls satyagraha "truth-force" or "soul-force." "Nonviolence," wrote Gandhi, "is an active force of the highest order. It is soul-force or the power of Godhead within us . . .. We become Godlike to the extent we realize nonviolence . . ,."23 In Hind Swaraj Gandhi said, When I refuse to do a thing that is repugnant to my conscience, I use soul-force.. .. If I do not obey the law and accept the penalty for its breech, I use soul-force. It involves the sacrifice of self... (which) is infinitely superior to sacrifice of others.24 While brute-force is based on egotism, conflict and suffering, soul-force is based on love, trust and humility that create harmony and happiness.25 Satyagraha has four elements: the perpetrator of the untruth and injustice; the crisis in the context of time and space; the satyagrahi who resists the untruth; and the techniques of the nonviolent struggle. The satyagrahies to start with have little direct hold on the thinking and the behaviour of the perpetrator of the wrong. Hence the Gandhain focus is mainly on the satyagrahies and their methods of satyagraha. According to Gandhism satyagraha is cultivated through determination and dedication, discipline, fearlessness and courage, patience and 53</page><page sequence="14">endurance, suffering, sacrifice and service. For satyagrahies, Gandhi prescribed tough requirements, "Satyagraha," said Gandhi, "is possible of fulfilment only by a long course of self-purification and suffering."26 In other words satyagrahies should purge themselves of psychological violence i.e., of prejudice, fear, hate, intolerance, selfishness, etc.. Some of the rigorous codes of values and conduct that Gandhi proposed were - honesty, total discipline, willingness to sacrifice everything - wealth, possessions, personal liberty, and readiness to face bullets, bayonets and death, and nonviolence in thought, word and deed.27 Because satyagrahies are committed to truth, as they perceive it, they should not knowingly and consciously fight for untruth. More than that they should be ready to adknowledge the truths in the opponent's position; they should be willing to accept their own faults and failures. In order to show goodwill and credibility, the satyagrahies should be everwilling to compromise whenever possible, of course, without sacrificing truth and without compromising with untruth.28 If inculcation of love is the objective of satyagraha, then the satyagrahies should not aim to harm or hurt or embarass or exploit the opponent; we don't harm the people we love! They should be everwilling to listen, to understand and to empathize with the opponent.29 To win the confidence of the opponent, the satyagrahies should keep everything open, above-board, without secret plots, dishonest deals, or distorted propaganda; they should keep the opponent always informed on the positions, policies and plans of the satyagrahies. In Gandhi's words, "A satyagrahi bids goodbye to fear. He is therefore never afraid of trusting the opponents."30 Satyagraha is noncooperation with the evil deed, not the evil doer. If seva i.e., service and sacrifice are the expressions of love, then satyagrahies should never pursue purely selfish interests.31 They should be ready to serve and care not only for other satyagrahies, but also for the opponents whenever necessary. For example, if the opponent is hurt, wounded, or in pain, or in need of help, it is the bounden duty of the satyagrahies to go to their opponent's rescue even at the cost of their own well being, because seva - service and sacrifice, is the instrument of satyagraha. Self-suffering is the proud badge that satyagrahies wear! Satyagraha is for the emancipation of the satyagrahies as well as of those who are slaves to untruth and injustice. Putting it differently, the satyagrahies should be willing to die not only for their own "sins," but also for the "sins" of others! Satyagrahies should never aim to injure or destroy others, including their opponent. By impoverishing, disabling or destroying their challengers, neither the wealthy can seek sustenance from the poor, nor the strong from the weak, nor the free from the enslaved. By deliberately generating distrust, anger and violence in the opponents, the satyagrahies can never win over the opponents, can never live in peace, can never improve their own lot, and can 54</page><page sequence="15">never enjoy their jobs or their lives. Wellbeing of all is the best guarantee for the wellbeing of the satyagrahies. Satyagrahies should never be unmindful of the interests of other groups, or other classes, or other towns, or other countries. While on strike, the factory workers should not aim to destroy the factory owner; nor should they be thoughtless of the interests of the farmers or the citizens. Citizens of a country should not goad or force their government to loot and exploit other countries in order to enrich their own lives. Satyagrahies should have a commitment to sarvodaya! Being dedicated to truth, love and universal well being, satyagrahies should adhere to nonviolence. Satyagrahies should not resort to physical force or violence either in attacking the opponent or even in their self-defence. They should be ever ready to accept without physical retaliation, the punishment for their non-cooperation and disobedience with the evil doer, be it economic deprivation, political persecution or arrest and imprisonment, or physical torture or death. Prejudice, hate and violence cannot generate open-mindedness, love and nonviolence; they can only generate prejudice, hate and violence. History is a witness to this relay race through which individuals, groups, nations and generations have passed on the baton of hate and violence, and destruction and death. The contemporary world, equipped with instruments of mass destruction and human annihilation, cannot afford to sustain and strengthen the vicious cycle, unless pyhrric victory or mutual destruction is the goal, unless human beings degenerate so far as to fall in love with hate, and to enjoy destruction and death. By any standards of rationality, sanity and humanity, such degeneration cannot be natural or normal for human beings. The only way to end the vicious cycle of injustice and violence, is to respond to prejudice with truth, to meet hate with love, and to overcome violence with nonviolence. The Relevance of Satyagraha to Contemporary Crises: The techniques of satyagraha will greatly depend upon the nature and the context of the crisis. Satyagrahies may resort to any of the following methods: (1) Petitioning government; (2) taking court action; (3) representation to legislators, political parties or interest groups; (4) participating in elections; (5) appealing to general public; (6) if none of these avenues are open fully or effectively, then satyagrahies can resort to extra-constitutional techniques of nonviolent noncooperation with the opponents; and (7) a further escalation of satyagraha would lead to the employment of the technique of civil disobedience. Through the last two techniques, Gandhi wedded democracy and nonviolent revolution; this experiment was never tried before in history! Global application of satyagraha: Until very recently the most-repeated criticism of Gandhian nonviolence was that it could not have worked in fascist Germany and it cannot be effective against communist 55</page><page sequence="16">dictatorship. This criticism has been invalidated by the recent developments in some of the undemocratic and the totalitarian countries of the world. The continuing nonviolent anti-apartheid struggle in fascist South Africa, the successful Solidarity movement in Poland, and the victorious nonviolent candle-burning protest rallies in East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria are outstanding vindications of the relevance and the success of nonviolent mass movements on Gandhian lines. Though the Chinese students' nonviolent agitation in the Tienanmen Square in Beijing has been suppressed for the time being, the Chinese democracy movement cannot be assumed to have died away. What is historically significant is the fact that a nonviolent movement did gush out in Beijing, the very heart of the biggest totalitarian state! While the Stalinist oppression may not return to Gorbachev's Soviet Union, let us hope the crises in Estonia, Lathvia, Lithuania and Azerbaijan would be handled through nonviolent policies of the Soviet government and of the peoples of these regions. The historic anti-racist civil rights movement of the American blacks under Martin Luther King, the nonviolent revolution against Marco's dictatorship in the Philippines, are testimonies to the cross-cultural application of Gandhian satyagraha to fight racism and authoritarianism. One may even venture to predict that if the Intifada movement of the Palestinians could become totally nonviolent, even the Israeli extremism and militarism could be defeated by the Palestinians themselves. Similarly, if the Irish catholics and protestants could ever agree to use Gandhian nonviolent methods to settle their religious differences without the interference of Britain or other Irish groups from abroad, it may not be impossible to conceive of peace returning to the Christian Northern Ireland. Sikh terrorism in India in particular, is a double tragedy because it is violence and because it is in the land of Gandhi. The only possible and permanent solution to Sikh terrorism is Gandhian nonviolence. The governments of India and the Punjab and the peaceloving sikhs and non-sikhs of India should be imaginative and courageous enough to conquer the evils of religionism, parochialism and militarism that are shaping the terrorist tragedies in the Punjab. Conclusions: Religionism, racism, chauvinism, authoritarianism, militar ism and materialism are the six facets of our contemporary crises that are challenging human well being, human happiness, indeed, the very existence of humanity! Gandhian humanism as contained in the six elements of satya (truth), prema (love), sarvodaya (well being of all), seva (service), ahimsa (nonviolence), and satyagraha (nonviolent struggle), is the most relevant, the most practical and the most desirable approach in tackling the contemporary crises. 56</page><page sequence="17">NOTES 1.

Any compromise must be natural to oneself, not imposed from without." (p. 164-65).
