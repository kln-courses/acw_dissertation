<plain_text><page sequence="1">ASIAN ART CHINESE ART Bell Chinese (Eastern Chou period), late 6th-early 5th century B.C. Bronze Height, I5 in. (38 cm) Charlotte C. and John C. Weber Collection, Gift of Charlotte C. and John C. Weber through Live Oak Foundation, 1988 1988.20.8 The Museum's holdings of archaic Chinese bronzes were greatly strengthened in 1987 and 1988 by the donation of eight objects of major significance from the Charlotte C. and John C. Weber Collection. With the exception of one piece (illustrated on the cover), they all date from the late Western Chou and Eastern Chou periods (9th-3rd century B.C.), thus fitting in perfectly with the Museum's existing archaic bronzes, which include a particularly fine group of ritual vessels of the late Shang to early Western Chou periods (13th-ioth century B.C.). The Weber gifts extended the range of the Museum's collec- tion of early Chinese ritual bronzes and also brought the Metropolitan its first important bronze bell. During the Shang and Chou dynasties music played an essential part in rituals central to the religious, social, and political activities of the time. In the Eastern Chou period (770-256 B.C.), as music became more elaborate, sets of bronze bells with a tonal range of two octaves or more became the chief instru- ments in the Chinese orchestra. The height of this develop- ment came in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., during which sets of bells were made that covered a range of up to five octaves at semitone intervals. The lentoid cross section of these bells gives them a singular acoustical property: when struck at different points, such bells can produce two notes at an interval of a major or minor third. The musical bells of the Eastern Chou period can also be appreciated as works of art; their surface decoration is as rich as that of ritual vessels, which served as containers for offerings of food and wine. The suspension loop on top of these bells provides an opportunity for three-dimensional ornament and often takes the form of a pair of dragons, as on the Weber bell. This bell can be accurately dated, as it is stylistically very close to a set of bells found in a recent archaeological exca- vation at Hui-hsien, Honan Province, a site datable to the late Spring and Autumn period (772-481 B.C.). There is a similar bell in the Winthrop Collection at the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University. j W Entries by James Watt, Senior Curator; Martin Lerner, Curator; Alfreda Murck, Associate Curator and Administrator; Barbara B.

(53.5 x 33 cm) Fletcher Fund, 1987 1987.275 Pictorial silks in tapestry weave (k'o-ssu) are the most val- ued of all textiles in China. The technique of the tapestry weave (using wool yarn) has a very long history in areas near Khotan in Central Asia, going back to at least the first century B.c. Silk tapestry has been found at seventh-century sites at Turfan. It was probably introduced to interior China during the Northern Sung period (960-II27) through the kingdoms of Hsi-hsia (1o32-1227) and Liao (907-1125), established by Sinicized nomadic peoples in northern China after the collapse of the Tang Empire. Very few examples of early pictorial k'o-ssu produced in the Sung period have survived. The several small pieces known outside China, including two at the Metropolitan, have all been taken off mounts of early handscrolls. These are probably products of the Southern Sung period (1I27-79). A small group of tapestry panels has appeared recently in a style much closer to the art of Central Asia in terms of the nature and treatment of the subject matter. This piece ac- quired by the Metropolitan has as its chief motif dragons with characteristics closely resembling those of dragons found in the Turfan area on wall paintings in cave temples, which are generally dated to the tenth century. Moreover, the association of dragons with floral scrolls is also of Cen- tral Asian origin. The weaving here is almost as fine as that on Sung k'o-ssu, except the silk yarn is rougher and less uniform. The colors of this piece also correspond to those of Sung k'o-ssu, but they are much fresher and more vivid, owing to its excellent state of preservation. Another techni- cal characteristic of this k'o-ssu is the use of gilt parchment, an indication of a Central Asian origin. It is most likely that this panel was made in the nomadic states of Hsi-hsia or Liao and that it is an example of the antecedents of Sung k'o-ssu. A work of very high artistic merit, this textile is also an important document in the study of the history of k'o-ssu in China.

(11z. x z5.4 cm) Purchase, Joseph E. Hotung Gift, 1987 1987.z77 This panel shows a technique unexpected in China or any- where else at such an early date. On a cloud damask of dark green silk a group of tree peonies is worked in silk needle-looping over shapes of gold paper. Tiny geometric designs in openwork, allowing the gold to show through, appear on each petal of the flowers and on the butterfly. Strips of gold paper stitched down by colored-silk open- chain stitch form the stems and the border. The butterfly at the top is decorated with knot stitches and is float stitched over the needle-looped body, which is lightly padded. A clue to the date is the fact that during the Sung period in China such butterfly and flower designs were frequently used in other decorative arts, as in jade carvings. Two related examples of this distinctive needlework technique are pre- served in Japanese temple treasuries as Important Cultural Properties. One is a cushion in the Engaku-ji, among Yuan (1zo6-1368) textiles and vestments associated with the founder of the temple, Mugaku Sogen. The other is a panel from a battle flag, which, according to an accompanying in- scription, was taken from the Korean army by the troops of Toyotami Hideyoshi during his invasion of Korea in the sixteenth century. Needle-looping, mainly in linen, was the basic stitch of the needle laces, one of the great arts of the West from the six- teenth through the nineteenth century. It is also a distinctive part of the raised-work ("stumpwork") pictures, caskets, and mirror frames done by fashionable young women in Stuart England and occasionally with less dedication by embroiderers on the Continent at a slightly earlier date. The appearance of a Chinese version made with even greater skill centuries before it was known in the West opens tre- mendously interesting vistas for scholarly investigations and presents as well a dazzling tour de force for Museum visi- tors. The panel's visual impact is further enhanced by its excellent state of preservation.

(143 x 135 cm) Purchase, Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat Gift, Louis V. Bell and Rogers Funds, and Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust Gift, in honor of Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg, 1988 I988.8Z This aubergine gauze square, by virtue of its central medal- lion of phoenixes in couched gold circling a flaming pearl among clouds, can be firmly dated to the Yuan dynasty. These mythical birds parallel those on the large stone slabs found at the site of a Taoist temple built in 1316 in the northwest quarter of the Yuan capital, Ta Tu, in Peking, and they also appear on blue-and-white porcelains of the period. The unusually luminous gold yarns forming the birds are of paper strips wrapped with gold leaf, a treatment not seen so far on other early textiles. The symmetrical vases in each corner with their springing vinelike arabesques bearing small flowers and leaves-em- broidered in silks in white and shades of green, pink, and blue-come from a different tradition. They echo motifs from India or the Late Classical world. The bases that ap- pear to support them may represent a Chinese addition, since they do not appear in the Central Asian examples. Although this square was probably used as a canopy for a Most Holy Place, stretched horizontally over an icon or holy figure in accord with Tibetan Buddhist custom, the combi- nation of cultural influences it embodies is characteristic of the Mongol Empire at the time it was ruled from the Yuan dynasty in China by the Mongol khan, Kubilai. The golden birds represent the Mongol love of gold. The fine gauze and marvelously skilled embroidery could have been produced by Chinese artist-craftsmen somewhere in the eastern part of the Mongol Empire for a diplomatic gift to a great Tibetan monastery.

(30.3 X 177.2 cm) Gift of John M. Crawford, Jr., 1988 1988.135 As a descendant of the imperial family of the recently van- quished Sung dynasty (960-1279), Chao Meng-fu was an unlikely candidate for service in the government of the de- spised Mongol conquerors. By tradition, citizens of a fallen dynasty remained loyal to that regime: cooperation with the enemy was seen as a betrayal. Chao Meng-fu, however, accepted office under Kubilai Khan, and served with dis- tinction at the Yuan court. During this time, he emerged as the most innovative calligrapher and painter of his age. On the tenth day of New Year's celebrations in 1296, Chao Meng-fu painted this robust horse and its groom. Based on the classical plain line (pai-miao) technique of Li Kung-lin (about o149-I106), the painting was executed in steady, supple lines, which depended directly on Chao's thorough training in the art of calligraphy. Chao dedicated the paint- ing to Fei-ch'ing, a fellow Chinese official. Although the of- ficial remains unidentified, we can assume that he and Chao shared the goal of educating the Mongol rulers and, where possible, modifying their policies that violated Chinese political ideals. Chao's brief inscription is apolitical, but the very image of horse and groom suggests a political message. In the Chi- nese tradition horses had long been associated with the power of the state and the tension between freedom and political control. Thus the harmonious relationship between the powerful but docile steed and the self-assured groom in- vites an interpretation of a headstrong state firmly governed by a wise official. Confucian concerns aside, horse paintings were appreciated by the Mongols as a reminder of their nomadic heritage. By 1359 this painting had passed into the hands of Hsieh Po-li, who sent it through a mutual friend to Chao Meng-fu's son Chao Yung, asking him to paint a companion picture. He complied, and two months later Hsieh made the same request of Chao Lin, Chao Yung's son. Although suspecting motives of greed, Chao Lin could not resist the appeal of having his composition joined with those of his father and grandfather. The three separate paintings (only Chao Meng-fu's is illustrated here) were probably mounted to- gether about that time. In subsequent centuries writers of this scroll's colophons-including the late Ming-dynasty master Ch'en Hung-shou (1599-1652)-remarked on the extraordinary rarity of having three generations of the illus- trious Chao family represented in one scroll, a sentiment that is resoundingly echoed today.

(15.5 x 23 cm) Gift of Douglas Dillon, 1987 1987.408.2 Chang Feng was a young man preparing himself for a gov- ernment career when Peking fell to the Manchus in June 1644. Chang's hometown, Nanking, suffered a chaotic year of political intrigue and warfare before it, too, fell to the in- vaders in 1645. This album was painted in August 1644, just as the Ming dynasty was crumbling. Surprisingly, Chang's album makes no overt reference to the chaos into which his world had been plunged. In fact, the country had been ravaged by bandits and terror- ized by the threat of invasion for over a decade; the album shows that Chang Feng had already withdrawn from the "dusty world" of politics into the realm of the recluse-artist. In creating these idyllic images, Chang turned to the pale dry style of Ni Tsan (1301-1374), but the gossamer light- ness of Chang's touch adds a new lyrical charm to the Ni Tsan style. Keenly interested in language, Chang explored the expressive interplay of visual and poetic imagery on many of the leaves in fresh and insightful ways: one leaf describes the murmur of pines and the sound of water run- ning over rocks; another evokes the echoes of a stone tossed into a deserted valley; on a third the artist has painted a sunset, a subject rarely depicted by scholar-artists. No leaf expresses Chang's state of mind better than the one shown here. It illustrates a verse by Ma Chih-yuan (about 12,60-1324), the middle three lines of which Chang in- scribed on his painting: [I have] finished with fame and fortune and separated myself from right and wrong. Red dust does not pollute my doorstep, Green trees cluster around, covering the corners of my house. Blue mountains exactly fill in the breach atop my wall; My thatch hut has a bamboo hedge. [translation by Julia K. Murray] To translate this poetic image into painting, Chang Feng turned to the idiom of Wang Meng (about 1308-1385), a contemporary of Ni Tsan and equally renowned as a painter of idyllic mountain hermitages. Simplifying Wang's convo- luted brush manner and reducing the scale, Chang evoked his poetic and stylistic sources without being bluntly literal. Chang's taste for carefully observed detail is summed up by the cottage's open gate, a perfect expression of the joy and freedom of life in retirement.

(17.5 cm) Purchase, Richard and Peggy Danziger Gift, 1987 1987.151 The Museum's display of Buddhist art, one of the highlights of the Japanese galleries, is considerably enhanced by the addition of this ritual thunderbolt, a prime example of the most significant spiritual symbol in Esoteric Buddhism. Rep- resentative of the Heian period, when Tantric rites were in- troduced to Japan, it now joins its counterpart, a ritual bell with a tray (1975.z68.170,171) from the following century to form a distinguished group of sacred implements that ex- hibits an important aspect of Buddhist worship as well as of Japanese metalwork. In the Tantric, or Esoteric, Buddhist practice of envisioning the spiritual world represented in the mandala and, in the process, experiencing the nature of Buddhahood, imple- ments were held in sacred gestures (mudra) accompanied by the recitation of prescribed sacred formulas (mantra). This potent sacramental function required implements of the highest craftsmanship. The newly acquired vajra, superbly cast and exquisitely finished with details of stylized lotus and jewel decoration, achieves both a severity of form ap- propriate to its function and the refined grace of the Heian period. Elegantly tapered prongs are set apart from the cen- tral diamond-shaped bolt, a stylistic detail that distinguishes this piece from the more numerous examples surviving from the succeeding Kamakura period. BBF 88</page><page sequence="8">KANO SCHOOL Japanese (Momoyama period), znd half of the i6th century Birds and Flowers of the Four Seasons Pair of six-fold screens, mineral pigments on gold-leafed paper Each screen, 421/8 X 373/4 in. (lo6.7 x 349.9 cm) Purchase, Mrs. Jackson Burke and Mary Livingston Griggs and Mary Griggs Burke Foundation Gifts, 1987 1987.342.1,2 Across the twelve panels of this pair of folding screens, a rich profusion of bird and flower motifs celebrates the cycli- cal progression of the seasons. In the right-hand screen (not illustrated) springtime wildflowers and blossoming trees provide the setting for the main image of a crane with its young, while in the left foreground a clump of summer lilies announces the transition through summer to fall and winter, which are represented in the left-hand screen shown here. Spanning the four central panels of the pair is a clump of bamboo glimpsed beyond a golden brushwood fence and clouds. Emphasizing the leftward movement of the overall design, pink and white rose mallow, signaling late summer and early autumn, grow around the fence and fantastically eroded rocks to set the scene for a majestic finale in the snow-covered pine that arches across the screen. It frames a pair of mature cranes, whose stately confronting pose reca- pitulates the rhythm of the total design. This pair of screens is so similar in composition and motifs to a set (Hakutsuru Museum, Kobe) by Kano Motonobu (1476- 1559) done in 1549, when he was seventy-four, that it must be assigned to the early years of the Kano school, which he es- tablished as the official atelier to the Ashikaga shogunate. The screens' gorgeous effects of brilliant mineral pigments on gold, accentuated by the technique of building up the surface of the brushwood fence with plaster (gofun) and the outlines of the clouds with painted gold, were well suited to the architectural taste of the later Momoyama period, exemplified by the works of Kano Eitoku (1543-1590). His style, characterized by a two-dimensional handling of volume and spatial recession and a bold isolation of larger bird and flower motifs against a gold ground, is evident in the Metropolitan's screens, among the most visually stunning and representative examples in the history of the Kano school. BBF 89</page><page sequence="9">INDIAN AND SOUTHEAST ASIAN ART Nagaraja and Nagini (Serpent King and Consort) India (Madhya Pradesh), Gupta period, about znd quarter of the 5th century Stone Nagaraja: height, 38%7/ in. (98.7 cm); Nagini: height, 34/2 in. (87.6 cm) Gift of The Kronos Collections, 1987 1987.415.1,2 The animistic worship of serpents (nagas) on the Indian subcontinent is considerably more ancient than the worship of Brahmanical deities or the Buddha and may go back to the dawn of civilization. Snakes, and particularly their re- generative aspects, have disturbed and captured the popular imagination of many cultures, and serpent worship is en- countered in areas geographically quite distant. In India nagas are associated with water, which is consid- ered holy. Temples dedicated to naga worship were some- times constructed over ancient sites affiliated with nagas. Attesting to the popularity of this cult in India is the existence of many anthropomorphic statues of Nagarajas (Serpent Kings), which usually take the form of a standing figure set against the flattened coils of a cobra and canopied by its large outspread hood. The cobra normally has seven heads for a Nagaraja and five for a Nagini (Serpent Queen, the consort of a Nagaraja). These popular tutelary deities were enlisted into the service of the major religions and figure prominently in both Hindu and Buddhist legend. This Serpent King stands with both feet firmly and uni- formly positioned on the ground in the samabhanga stance. His lowered left hand holds a flask, and between the thumb 90</page><page sequence="10">and forefinger of his raised right hand he holds the stem of a lotus (the flower is missing). The Nagaraja is framed by the heavy coils of the serpent-three at each side. Although only a portion of the septenary cobra hood has survived, enough is present to establish the relationship of scale be- tween human figure and naga. The Nagini stands in the same manner as her consort and is similarly framed by coils and hoods. Her raised right hand holds a lotus flower, and her left hand is placed on her left hip. She wears a tightly adhering transparent garment and a thick scarf, of which only the section falling down her left side has survived. Her hair is arranged in a Gupta period style, and in the center of her hairdo, above her forehead, is a large jeweled medallion. The stocky, powerful proportions of the Nagaraja are remi- niscent of the sculptural styles of Madhya Pradesh during the first half of the fifth century, particularly those at Uda- yagiri. The Nagini shows the beginnings of the trend toward a taller, more elegantly proportioned figure as seen on some sculptures from Sanchi, stylistically datable to around the second quarter of the fifth century. Because the Nagaraja and Nagini are closer in style to the Sanchi sculptures, they should be assigned a similar date. Despite the more refined and elegant proportions, their lithic qualities are reminiscent of the power and iconic monumentality associated with pre- Gupta period sculptures. The resolute gazes of both figures enhance their authority and presence, although the effect is tempered by the sensual beauty of their faces. Both figures are carved in the round, the intertwined coils of the naga clearly defined on the backs in low relief. Their frontal orientation suggests that they might originally have been placed against a temple wall. Gupta period representations of Nagarajas are relatively rare, particularly when compared to the number of surviv- ing Kushan period examples. Gupta Naginis are even rarer. This pair is therefore of major importance and must be con- sidered a significant link in the chain of Gupta sculpture studies. ML Bibliography: M.

(98.5 cm) Gift of Doris and Harry Rubin, in memory of Ralph Konheim, 1987 1987.308 Among the many splendid works of art donated to the col- lection, two very important Khmer sculptures go a long way in helping us develop a synoptic survey of the great artistic achievements of ancient Cambodian culture. The first is dat- able on the basis of style to the brief Koh Ker period (921- about 945), when Jayavarman Iv, the brother-in-law of the legitimate Khmer king, revolted and set up a new capital approximately fifty miles northeast of Angkor at Koh Ker. The Koh Ker style is characterized by broad-chested figures with powerful shoulders, full stomachs, and wide hips sup- ported by heavy-set legs. The garment worn is quite thick, with the upper hem projecting far from the hips. Many of the Koh Ker period sculptures are unusually large, and a significant innovation of the style is the depiction of subsidi- ary figures in the round-wrestlers or guardians-actively in motion. The figure illustrated is a rare guardian deity of stern aspect, with bulging eyes and fangs. The powerful proportions, the striking physiognomy, and the somewhat aggressive stance combine to lend an air of great authority to this fine sculpture.

(i16.z cm) Gift of Margery and Harry Kahn, 1987 1987.414 The great step-pyramid temple Baphuon, constructed dur- ing the third quarter of the eleventh century, is, after Ang- kor Wat, the largest temple at Angkor. It lends its name to one of the most beautiful and seductive art styles in the his- tory of Southeast Asia-one that is very easy to respond to. Until recently, this style has been represented in our collec- tion by two excellent female figures, one in bronze, the other in stone. The addition of this superb male deity fills an im- portant gap in our Cambodian holdings and is, in fact, the most significant gift of Cambodian sculpture ever made to this institution. The standing four-armed male deity, whose finely plaited hair arranged in a high bun secured by a jeweled ring sug- gests that he represents Shiva, is surely among the top rank of Baphuon-style male figures. Elegant in its attenuation of forms and superbly modeled, the deity stands in a frontal posture subtly modified by the right leg being set forward and the knee very slightly bent. The figure wears a finely pleated sampot, with a portion of that garment drawn between the legs and knotted behind. The weight of the material is much lighter than that on the Koh Ker guardian, and the sampot adheres tightly to the body, dipping sensually below the navel. The garment forms the typical Baphuon "pockets" above the left thigh, and the jeweled sash may be associated with a royal commission. The rich surface decoration of the sampot contrasts vividly with the large expanses of bare skin, and the high polish of the stone's surface enhances the sense of tautness of the smooth skin, emphasizing the tactile qualities of this wonderful sculpture.

(68.5 x 54.6 cm) Purchase, Friends of Asian Art Gifts, 1987 1987.144 The identity of the central personage of this thanka is prob- lematic. He is portrayed as an adept of Tantric (Esoteric) Buddhism. He balances a magic horn with the fingers of his raised right hand, and in the palm of his left hand rests a casket (?) surmounted by a snow lion, the vehicle of Manjushri, the bodhisattva of divine knowledge. He is seated on an elaborate throne placed within a frame repre- senting mountains. He is naked except for a loincloth and wears elaborate jewelry-decorated with crossed vajras (thunderbolts) and small standing figures-and a yellow helmet. An embroidered cloth, once attached to the paint- ing, had the Sanskrit inscription jnana tapa ("heat of knowledge"). Although epithets were often given to emi- nent personages, no such name is known from the detailed early historical record. The inscriptions of most of the other personages in the thanka allow them to be identified. The majority of the lamas on the upper portion of the painting are abbots of the Taglung Monastery of the Kagyupa order, beginning with its founder, Thang-pa Chen-po (142-12-zo). The figures surrounding the bottom half are eight of the eighty-four Mahasiddhas (Perfected Ones), the spiritual fathers of Tan- trayana Buddhism. At the top center of the painting presides an adi-Buddha (primordial Buddha) (?) with his consort. The whole ensemble therefore probably illustrates the trans- mission of a particular Tantric doctrine(s) from its source (the adi-Buddha) through the Mahasiddhas to the central figure and then to this branch of the Kagyupa order. It is in- teresting that neither Tilopa nor Naropa, the two Mahasid- dhas most associated with the Kagyupa doctrinal tradition, is included among the eight in the painting, nor does Marpa, founder of the order, appear. All of these are possible can- didates for the central figure, although all are usually shown with different attributes. Another possibility is Atisha, the Indian monk who initiated the great reformation of Tibetan Buddhism in the eleventh century. Considered an incarna- tion of Manjushri, he is shown in another early portrait wearing a similar Indian-style helmet. This painting is datable to around 1300 on the basis of both the dates of the last lamas portrayed and its style. Individu- al elements in the work, such as the frame of mountains, the pattern of the border and throne, the throne style and the pillow types, hark back to the Tibetan version of the (Indian) Pala style, but the subtle coloration, more florid or- namentation, and anecdotal pictorialism indicate that these are only the last vestiges of that more restrained style, which here has been replaced with one better suited to convey the extroverted content of Tantric imagery. The use of shading in the figures is particularly unusual and is not a frequent feature in either the Indianized or later Tibetan styles. The rarity, beauty, and unique iconography of this painting make it an important addition to the small corpus of extant early Tibetan thankas as well as the finest early Tibetan work of art in the collection.
