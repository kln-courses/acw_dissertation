<plain_text><page sequence="1">Writing an Image - The Formulation of the Tree Goddess Motif in the Book of the Dead, Ch. 59 Nils Billing Abstract The compilation of the Book of the Dead (BD) during the New Kingdom mirrors a revision of earlier funerary and cultic texts that made an increasing use of the vignette as a signifying element. The vignettes were not merely pertinent illustrations to certain texts, but could also, due to the iconic nature of the Egyptian script itself, hold linguistic qualities that could be read. In this perspective they became images, signifying concepts or motifs from an older textual tradition. The rhetoric of the image is well illustrated in the iconographic formulation of the tree goddess in reference to BD 56 and 59. The spells are virtually identical with the exception of the opening lines that centre on Atum and Nut respectively. A retrospect into the Pyramid Texts chosen for the sarcophagus chambers of Old Kingdom pyramids reveal an old conception of these gods as embracing the king, a strong metaphor for bodily integration in terms of pregnancy and birth. This early analogue between the creator-god and the mother goddess created a decisive link between cosmogony and rebirth imagery that eventually would lead to the creation of the "tree goddess spell" BD 59 from the older cosmogonic tradition transmitted by CT 222/BD 56. The image of the Nut-tree, connected to BD 59, was also formulated in accordance with the old tradition. From a general corpus of possibilities, this tree goddess was given an emphasized human appearance to harmonize with the old picture of the embracing goddess, prostrating over her son. In his Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology (1986), W. J. T. Mitchell discusses the relationship between image and language, the distinction between which he patterns on the Platonic paradigm of nature vs. convention: ?regarding 'nature' as something biological, objective, and universal, 'convention' as something social, cultural, and local or regional"1. The relation word/image is thus a mirror of the age-old struggle of human control and abstrac tion vs. the self-explanatory essence of nature. Images can certainly be tamed by people and according to their priorities and intentions be transformed into linguistic units that can be read. Nevertheless, their origin in untamed nature might still explain the anxiety often inherent in the interpretation of art. In the field of Egyptology scholars cannot even rest on the traditional distinction word/image, as the written signifiers of language, the hieroglyphs, are in fact images themselves. Even in the immediate combination of text and image, the device so common in Egyptian art, the two media might through their mutual iconic quality merge to an extent that in other linguistic systems, with their arbitrary yet static tokens, is impossible2. Thus we find cases in Old Kingdom reliefs where the icono graphic elements simultaneously function as large-scale linguistic components of the 1 W. J. T. Mitchell, Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology, 1986, 76-77. 2 The existence of images in writing systems is not confined to ancient Egypt but is a most diverse phenomenon, found in many writing systems of the world, see H. Witte, in: The Image in Writing (Visible Religion VI), 1988, VII-XI.</page><page sequence="2">36 N. Billing SAK 32 accompanying text3. In other situations, iconographic elements of a scene can, as icons, be transferred into the text. Considering the subject chosen for this article, a convenient example of this latter possibility is the tree goddess scene in TT 93 (Fig. 3) where the central representation of the sycamore is mirrored in the text above through the deter minative of nht. Instead of the normative and highly schematised tree-determinative, we recognise a tree of unusual naturalistic style, making it essentially a replica of the sycamore below4. The image is thus not primarily to be considered as a mere illustration, but as a decisive semantic component which can be read through its inherent linguistic quality. Given the intimate relationship between text and image in compositions from the earliest period of ancient Egyptian culture, a ?reading of the image", i.e. the detection of ideas and associations invested in an iconographic motif, is then often made possible through a joint reading of text and image as two complementary media of information. In cases where an older text is perhaps combined with an iconographic element, a situation which is best exemplified in the redaction of the Book of the Dead, we are actually given the possibility to look into the conceptual workings which led to the very formulation of the image. Apart from reading the image, we can understand why it was written. In studying conceptual process and iconographic formulation in relation to textual thematics, we can take a case study in this article and look closer at the tree goddess vignette of chapter 59 in the Book of the Dead, the traditional ?tree goddess spell". The general motif of the tree goddess is found as a common element in the repertoire of Egyptian funerary art from the 18 * Dynasty and later. In tombs, on stelae, papyri, coffins etc the personified tree serves as a manifestation of an otherworldly protective and maternal principle. Through the bestowment of water and provisions under her protecting shade, the deceased is provided with the life that generates within her. From this view, the tree goddess has been described as a conceptual metaphor of the mother goddess5. The icono graphical treatment of the motif ranges from scenes where the tree and the goddess, though forming a unit, are represented separately, to cases where only a pair of arms is added to the tree, i.e. where the human element is kept down to a minimum just in order to make the tree capable of action. In a few cases the tree goddess is also seen providing milk from her breast. The textual element is in general kept brief (although there are a few distinctive exceptions to this), usually confining itself to references concerning the provision of water 3 H. Fischer, Egyptian Studies II, 1977, 3-4. Cf. R. Tefhin, in: GM 79, 1984, 67; H. te Velde, in: The Image in Writing (Visible Religion VI), 1988, 177-178. 4 The far more common schematized sycamore sign, not used in the tree goddess scene of TT 93, has by O. Goldwasser, in: GM 170, 1999, 55, been identified as a basic level determinative ?which has relinquished its original meaning on behalf of the semene [TREE]". 5 O. Goldwasser, From Icon to Metaphor.

The tree goddess in scholarly discourse The tree goddess has over last century been the subject of a number of discussions, in which two particular issues have dominated: (a) conceptual background and (b) original identity6. Although these issues are not entirely separable, one might notice a general consensus concerning the conceptual background, with the tree goddess being recognised as a per sonification of the garden7. As this region was emblematic of a functioning funerary cult as well as a happy sojourn in the Beyond, the tree goddess has, for instance, simultaneously been characterised as ?die Personifikation eines jenseitigen Paradieses" and ?die sakramen tale Ausdeutung des Totenopfers"8. In contrast to this mutual agreement on background, the question concerning an original or principal identity of the personified tree has attracted more varied opinions. Von Bissing9 pointed early on to a notable dominance of the goddess Nut in the role of the tree goddess, but scholars have through her alleged origin in Old Kingdom tree cults and garden symbolism more often given preference to Hathor10. From this point of view, the dominance of Nut has been regarded as the result of a process where this alternative mother goddess had merely taken a role that originally belonged to Hat hor11. A decade ago, the path to a more profound understanding of the concept was opened by Othmar Keel, who in a study befittingly called Das Recht der Bilder gesehen zu werden12 included a discussion that focused on the tree goddess as an iconographical motif. Keel points to the notable paucity of illustrations in the previous discussions, deriving from a general ignorance of iconographic detail. In line with this approach, his treatment focuses on pictures (pp. 96-138), and only to a lesser extent on related comments (pp. 62-95). Besides valuable observations on the formulation of the motif from a chronological pers pective, Keel emphasises the distinction to be made between the specific identity in relation to the tree goddess as an independent concept: ?Die Sykomore ist das Eine, Ihre Deutung 6 For a comprehensive state of research, see N.

The old view of Hathor as the tree goddess par excellence, so completely refut ed by the documentation itself, continues for some reason to haunt modern Egyptology. For instance, in a most recent publication one finds the following statement: ?Hathor was thus sometimes viewed as a sky goddess and Nut sometimes replaces Hathor as the goddess of the divine sycamore tree who nourishes the deceased" (R. Wilkinson, The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt, 2003, 161). 12 Full title: Das Recht der Bilder gesehen zu werden.

As a matter of fact, a number of distinctive mother goddesses could manifest themselves in the personified tree14, as was it often deliberately left unnamed. Still, Keel lays no claim of completeness with respect to the collected material, but asserts that ?die monographische Bearbeitung, die dieses Thema verdienen wiirde, liegt bis heute nicht vor"15. Keel's invitation to a more in-depth study of the tree goddess was recently taken up in a study of the goddess Nut16. In this study the Heliopolitan sky goddess was recognised as a conceptual personification, operating around the two basic ideas of space and water as her core attributes. From this conceptual basis evolved different manifestation forms of the goddess that were linked to either or both of these attributes. Nut as the personified tree offered no exception to this notable pattern, and over 400 tree goddess scenes, published and unpublished, were collected and ordered in accordance of the types of monument on which they were found17. From this it emerged that there often were individual rules operating for the different types of monument, determining her iconographical realisation as well as identification with a specific deity. The visual manifestation and identity of the tree goddess served as important means of ensuring that the concept was living, effective and adequate in the specific thematic context. In the light of this asserted interdependence of monument and tree goddess, and in order to evaluate earlier scholarly opinions on conceptual background and identity as a decisive factor in its formulation, we must view every approach to the specific context (in this case the Book of the Dead) from the historical perspective of the concept's general formulation and evolution. The general formulation and evolution of the tree goddess concept The conception of personified trees is found as early as the Old Kingdom, in texts as well as iconography. It flashes by in the descriptions of the mythological landscape in the Pyramid Texts1*, with PT 574 most vigorously picturing a personified world-tree reaching all parts of the cosmos and its inhabitants19.

In the Middle Kingdom, the new redaction of the funerary literature, the Coffin Texts, does not include any descriptions of personified trees21, but presents another closely related motif: the garden. In this garden the deceased aspires to sojourn, and he gains access through a dialogue with the gods residing there: Where is it granted for you to eat? rdiw n=k wnm=ktn say they who are there, in=sn ntyw im under the branches of the sycamores. hr smiw nhwt I desire it mr=ist together with the musicians of Hathor, hnr hnywt nt hwt-hr because I am this bull with his testicles n-ntt ink is kipw hr isn=f who comes forth from Heliopolis. pr m Iwnw (CT III, 124d-j [199]; cf.

Already the Pyramid Texts suggest one (Pyr. 916b [470]) and two sycamores (Pyr. 1433b [568]) in the eastern sky, and also the Coffin Texts refer to ?two Fig. 1: The horizon of Osiris (TT 2), after Billing, Nut, 339. sycamores of turquoise from within which Re comes forth" (CT II, 367a-b [159]). Later we find this motif in BD 96/97, 109 and 149.22 One variant of CT III, 130h [203] (T3Be) connects the single sycamore, as the resting place of the deceased, to the two sycamores, thereby illustrating their mutual contextual and conceptual frame. 20 N. de G.

Newberry, in: ZAS 50, 1912, 79, saw in these occurrences a misunderstanding of an earlier sign where the arm instead consisted of a projecting branch.

Billing SAK 32 When a personification of the tree comes into operation in the pictorial records of the New Kingdom, it is initially found in the tomb of Tuthmosis III as a means of binding together the divine motherhood of Isis with the king's earthly mother of the same name23. Thereafter the tree goddess leaves royal art and becomes an increas ingly popular element in the private sepulchral world24. Already before Amarna she is found in tombs and on stelae, shaped within the well-defined conceptual framework of the garden with its strong cosmic and horizontal symbolism. This is rendered especially clear in the early tomb scenes, where the motif is first experienced in a personifi Fig. 2: The horizon of Osiris (TT 290), after Billing, Nut, 330. cation of the two sycamores. Tree goddess pairs are then arranged as the space-defining elements of the horizon in a garden/offering context, with the transitory character of this region being expressed through a garden lake (TT 6325), a false door (TT 39, 52 &amp; 7426) or physical passage in the tomb (TT 8427).28 The horizon symbolism experienced in the Osirian body is also demarcated by the double tree, both personified (TT 2) (Fig. 1) and not (TT 290) (Fig. 2)29. It is worthy of note that the double tree motif never found its fixed forms, something that is reflected in a great number of individual versions. 23 The connection to be made between the Isis-tree and the king's mother, who features in an upper scene on the same pillar wall, was pointed out by Moftah (op.cit., 46) and has since then remained an opinio communis. 24 In the royal sphere, the tree goddess appears once again during the 20th Dynasty in the tomb of queen Tyti (QV 52) (Billing, op.cit., 358 [Fig. C.2]). 25 Billing, op.cit, 211-212, 335 [Fig. A.10]. 26 Billing, op.cit, 212-213, 336-338 [Figs. A.ll-13]. 27 Billing, op.cit, 213, 338 [Fig. A. 14]. 28 Long since recognized within Egyptology as merely personifications of the garden, the horizon symbolism operating in these pairs was eventually pointed out by N. Baum, Arbres et arbustes de l'Egypte ancienne. La liste de la tombe thebaine d'Ineni (No 81), OLA 31, 1988, 62-67, and Keel, op.cit., 69-74. For a further and more comprehensive discussion on this subject, see Billing, op.cit., 201-223, 330-348 [Figs. A.l-32]. 29 The tradition of Osiris as the horizon from which the sun comes forth rests on the well-known formula in the Pyramid Texts (Pyr. 585a [357], 621b [364], 636c [368], 1887 [664]). The same Osirian character of the double tree horizon in TT 290 is conferred through the text added between the sycamores: ?It is Re who rests in Osiris and Osiris who rests in Re, daily".</page><page sequence="7">2004 Writing and Image 41 The single tree goddess, more common by far, was from the beginning created in the same distinctive horizonal symbolic frame. This is best illustrated in the early scene in TT 93 (Fig. 3). Found on the northern wall of the first traverse hall, the wall-space in the tombs of the 18th Dynasty normally containing a false-door or stela30, Qen amun can in a partly destroyed scene still be seen sitting under a magnificent sycamore with the goddess standing in front of him. The basic stela composition of the scene is retained through the flanking eyes. Probably due to the early and formative stage of the motif, a long and unique text was added, the first line of which allowed the godd ess to present herself: ?I am Nut, high and great in the horizon". In the numerous scenes that follow in the repertoire of the tomb as well as in all other monuments, the accompanying texts become briefer, often contenting themselves with exhort ations in which the deceased asks his divine mother Fig. 3: The Nut-tree (TT 93), after Keel, Das Recht der Bilder, Fig. 42. for provisions and water. This gives an impression of the tree goddess as a self-explanatory image, not in any particular need of a textual, explicatory element31. The independence" from any immediate textual reference also characterises the treatment of the motif in the Book of the Dead. The tree goddess in the Book of the Dead The major part of the Book of the Dead consists of material originating in the Coffin Texts or Pyramid Texts, and where the continuing editorial process of the funerary literature with the Book of the Dead integrated iconography as an extra-textual medium of information32. The creation and use of the different vignettes was primarily based on the earlier, 30 Usually the false door is found at the left end of the traverse hall, and the stela (like in TT 93) at the right end (A. Hermann, Die Stelen der thebanischen Felsgraber der 18. Dynastie, AF 11,1940,27-29). 31 I refrain here from a more thorough examination of the most varying realisations of the tree goddess in the early scenes found in tombs and on stelae. For this discussion, see Billing, op.cit., 254-259 (tombs), 285-292 (stelae), or Keel, op.cit., 64-68. 32 There are occasional ? vignettes" to the CT spells already on the Middle Kingdom coffins, cf.

Billing SAK 32 exclusively textual tradition, with the picture thematising central motifs or concepts found within the text33. The iconographic element in the Book of the Dead increases during the New Kingdom, in many cases showing a notable creative and diversified nature as in contrast to the more or less fixed character of the texts34. This richness of iconographic expression not only discloses a creative freedom on behalf of the ancient artist, but also points to the decisive status attached to the picture as an informative and performative medium. The latter aspect concerns the ritual context (Sitz im Leben) of the particular spell, I ^ 1 1 Sill Fig. 4: Hathor of the garden (pLouvre III 93), after E. Naville, Das ag. Todtenbuch der XVIII. bis XX. Dynastie, I, 1886, PL 80. and an instruction added to its end sometimes provides detailed information on the correct use of the text as well as the creation of the picture or object found in the vignette35. Thus the pictures are not mere illustrations but in fact images, conveying ideas embedded in the texts. The increased use of vignettes in funerary papyri would eventually result in manuscripts where the image more or less replaced the text. This development is mirrored also in the decorative schemes of the multicoloured coffins of the 3rd Intermediate Period and the so called mythologi cal papyri36. With such workings of the text/ image compositions in the Book of the Dead spells, we are given an opport unity to investigate the so-often-alleged origin of a ,,Hathoric" tree goddess in the equally Hathoric garden. 33 This does not mean that the text as a rule is to be given priority over the picture. Considering the iconic nature of the ancient Egyptian script, this would be a most hazardous position. 34 H. Brunner, in: H. Brunner/K.Schwager (eds.), Wort und Bild. Symposion des Fachbereiches Alter tums- und Kulturwissenschaften zum 500jahrigen Jubilaum der Eberhard-Karls-Universitat Tubingen, 1979, 203. The formulation of BD vignettes is treated in H. Milde, The Vignettes in the Book of the Dead of Neferrenpet, Egyptologische Uitgaven 7,1991. For the Book of the Dead in the Theban pri vate tombs, see M. Saleh, Das Totenbuch in den thebanischen Beamtengrabern des Neuen Reiches, AV 46, 1984. 35 Eschweiler, op.cit., 161-173. From this perspective, the Book of the Dead provided full means for a magic ritual which, in its classical formulation, operated through a combination of words, pictures and acts (Eschweiler, op.cit., 12-13 w. ref). In some cases the vignette represents the object to which the spell ideologically belonged and on which is was supposed to be written. For instance is the shabti spell BD 6 seldom found in the Book of the Dead manuscripts but occurs on thousands ofshabti stat uettes (H. Schneider, Shabtis. An Introduction to the History of Ancient Egyptian Funerary Statuettes I, 1977, 78ff.). 36 Eschweiler, op.cit., 182-183; A.

This circumstance strongly points against an immediate connection between the two motifs, an impression that gains strength from an early vignette of BD 68 in pLouvre III 93 (li?1 Dyn.) (Fig. 4). Here Hathor is found in her garden, pars pro toto represented by a tree, where she passively resides on her throne. In front of the goddess the deceased humbly kneels, in the text expressing his wish to ?sit under the branches of the zm^-trees near Hathor" (hms=i hr smiw imiw m-siht hwt-hr)3S. This vignette has sometimes been considered to represent a tree goddess39, but a strict consultation with the Stil geschichte40 of the motif during this early stage shows an active goddess providing the deceased with pro visions, the decisive aspect that led Baines to include the tree goddess among his emblematic personi fications, i.e. objects given human limbs to be capable of action41. Thus Hathor in the vignette of pLouvre III 93 is the ?goddess of the tree(s)" from the Coffin Texts tradition, and it seems that the iconographic element in this case has succeeded in further defining an old con ceptual difference between the goddess of the garden Fig. 5: The nursing tree (Cairo 1/7/24/3), after Billing, Nut, 385. and the tree goddess. The role of Hathor as the passive receiver of reverence in BD 68 is made further clear in the later vignettes of the same spell, displaying her in a shrine before which the deceased stands with raised arms42. It should additionally be pointed out that the tree goddess never, as far as can be determined, manifested herself in an iml-tree. The trees of the garden are placed under the auspice of Hathor, but neither this text nor its parallels ever pictures the goddess as personified in them, an important circumstance which makes a simple recognition of this Hathoric garden as the conceptual background of an original Hathoric tree goddess impossible. 37 Also in BD 124 the deceased states ?I eat under the branches". Like in BD 52, 68, 82 and 189, this reference is found in a context of an abomination for eating excrements in the Beyond. 38 CT III, 238a [225]. The earlier and well-documented versions of CT 225 mostly use ?myrrh-trees" (nhwt nt rntjw) instead of imlw (cf. Baum, op.cit., 225). The text in B4C refers to them both: ?May you sit there under [the branches], under the imlw, under the myrrh-trees".

Billing SAK 32 The number ofBook of the Dead manuscripts from the New Kingdom in which the tree goddess vignette is found is not in any way exhaustive, but still sufficient enough to clearly demonstrate its well-defined textual connection. Ten text/image compositions are known to me, distributed on seven papyri and three tomb scenes43. The earliest examples appear at the end of the 18th Dynasty on two tomb reliefs originating in Memphis (Hanover 2933 &amp; Cairo 1/7/24/3). With arms and breast as single human elements, the tree goddess provides the deceased with water and milk (Fig. 5)44 in combination with BD 61, a short spell which connects the deceased with the flood (igbgb) as a means of securing his access to water in the Necropolis45. In the papyri she is variously connected with BD 59, 60, 62 and 63A, 46 and to these is added another tomb scene from TT 215, where a badly destroyed representa tion of the tree goddess is found together with the title of BD 63 A47. The great number of scenes in contemporary tombs, however, is formally detached from the Book of the DeacP*. The combination of the tree goddess with the BD spells 59-63 A from the end of the 18th Dynasty turns the motif into a general iconographical expression for the old wish of Fig. 6: The Nut-tree of BD 59 (pBM 14070), after Keel, Das Recht der Bilder, Fig. 66a. air, water and susten ance49. In the Ptolemaic period, when she abounds in the manuscripts, the tree goddess is found also with other spells with the same principal themes, above all BD 57, but also BD 53, 54, 56 and 58.50 Only in BD 59 is there a reference to the tree godd ess of the vignette, ad 43 For this documentation, see Billing, op.cit., 235 (papyri), 273-274 (tombs). Through the amicable compliance from Dr. Irmtraut Munro, I was offered the possibility to look into the documentation of unpublished BD manuscripts collected in the Totenbuch-Archiv, Bonn. 44 Cairo 1/7/24/3 is the only known scene from the Egyptian iconographic repertoire where the tree goddess simultaneously provides the deceased with water and milk. 45 Billing, op.cit., 273-276, 384-385 [Figs. C.43 &amp; C.45]. The aim is explicitly stated in the title: ?Spell for drinking water in the Necropolis". Another contemporary tomb relief from the Memphis region (Cairo 1/7/24/6) likewise adds this title to the same type of tree goddess (Billing, op.cit., 386, Fig. C.46). An alternative title for BD 61 is ?Spell for not letting the ba of a man be taken from him in the Necropolis", see E. Naville, Das agyptische Todtenbuch der XVIII. bis XX.

A tendency in the New Kingdom scenes (Fig. 5 and 6), notable also during the later period (Fig. 7), is that the Nut-tree of BD 59 is given more enhanced human elements by comparision with the anonymous tree goddess with its more dendromorphic traits52. Book of the Dead, Ch. 59 The iconographic treatment of the tree goddess of BD 59, rendering her with a comparatively accentuated human appearance, indicates a specific status within the composition. The content of the text is also special in character as compared to BD 60-63 A as its latter half provides references to the cosmogonic conception traditionally linked with Hermopolis.

Such hypotheses illustrate a period when scholars searched rather for regional based origins than conceptual ones, and today a more profound undertaking would be to find ideas behind this apparent combination of the Nut-tree and the Hermopolitan egg of origin. The answers to this are found in the redaction of the funerary literature. A structural comparison of BD 59 with two other spells, BD 54 and 56, reveals 51 The late version (Sai'te rescension) of BD 152 often adds a vignette showing a kneeling female who sprinkles water and brings provision before the seated deceased. Some versions likewise identify this female as ?this sycamore of Nut", see e.g. Lepsius, op.cit., PL 74. 52 Billing, op.cit., 238-239 (BD papyri), 220-222 (BD on offering tables). By 'dendromorphic' is meant a tree goddess composition where the tree element dominates, with the arms as the single human ele ment necessary for making the tree capable of action. The anthropomorphic variants include the head and parts of the body to various extents. 53 Von Bissing, op.cit, 217-218; M.-L. Buhl, in: JNES 6,1947, 91.</page><page sequence="12">46 N.

BD 56 is basically identical to BD 59, though here it is not the sycamore of Nut, but the god Atum, who provides the deceased with life through his gift of air55.

As (pGenf CIV), after Billing, Nut, noticed by Bickel59, the apparent combination of a Heli 354. opolitan and Hermopolitan tradition must also been seen in relation to the fact that the primordial egg prior to the New Kingdom was primarily connected to Heliopolis. This situation could very well have promulgated the combination of this cosmogonic motif with two major deities of this city.

This brings us back to the core attributes, space and water, mentioned in the beginning of this article as fundamental ideas in the conceptualisation of the goddess Nut. With their tangible life-generating aspects, these attributes were the principal properties operating in the strong mother symbolism of the sky. Nut became the watery oval that through her prostration over the cosmos integrated within herself all the living in her life-generating body: (O) Nut, spread yourself over your son Nwtpss tn hr sl=t (Pyr. 777a [427]) You have enclosed for yourself sn.n=t n=t the earth and all things within your arms; tl ht nbt m-hnw cwy=t You have placed for yourself this NN di. n=t n=t NNpn as an Imperishable Star within you. m ihm-sk imy=t (Pyr. 782d-e [432]) The same body-centred metaphor of rebirth was early experienced in the god Atum, who in a masculine frame integrated his son corporeally within himself by the means of an embrace60. Already in the Pyramid Texts, this embrace of Atum is described in cosmo logical terms, identifying the god with the horizon: Orion is enclosed by the Dat, sn slh in dlt being pure and living in the horizon. wrb rnh m Iht Sothis is enclosed by the Dat, sn spdt in dlt being pure and living in the horizon. wcb rnh m Iht This NN is enclosed by the Dat, sn NNpn in dlt being pure and living in the horizon. wcb rnh m Iht Ax is for him and for them, Ih n=fn=sn coolness is for him and for them, kbb n=fn=sn within the arms of his father, m-hnw rwy it=f within the arms of Atum. m-hnw cwy Itm (Pyr. 151a-e [216]; cf. Pyr. 212a-213a [222]) Junker once saw in Atum and Nut two analogous personifications of the sky that originally had belonged to two distinct constructions of the world, but which in the formation of the Heliopolitan ennead were divided into different generations61. Although the correctness of 60 The transmission of life through Arum's embrace, conveying the concept of ka, has for instance been discussed by J. Assmann, Liturgische Lieder an den Sonnengott.

Billing SAK 32 such hypotheses can hardly be ratified, Junker must have come to this conclusion from the mutual attributes of space and parentage that these gods shared. In the study on Nut referred to above62, the present author could demonstrate how the chamber system of the Old Kingdom pyramids, through a conscious spatial distribution of the Pyramid Texts, was clearly divided into two consecutive ontological levels. Whereas the texts chosen for the sarcophagus chamber primarily picture a reconstitutional process, where the disturbed life as visualised through the disintegrated body of Osiris is reintegrated against a backdrop of mummification and offering ritual, the texts used in the other quarters of the tomb focus on ascension as manifesting the perennial victory of life over death, primarily with Horus and Re as representatives of the visual and living god. This division reveals two distinctive spatial and parental principals operating in the sarcophagus chamber: Atum and Nut63. As the common prostration formula of Nut was exclusively placed in the sarcophagus chamber to determine its role as the reconstitutional Nut-space64, so was an Atum-space likewise established through the references to the father's embrace in PT 213-219 &amp; 220-222, the sequence of spells as a rule found on the southern wall of the same chamber. In the passage above, we find Atum in a role of the western horizon where he integrates the king within himself, together with the decanal stars in the heliacal setting 65, i.e. the time of death and reconstitution66. Characterised as Ih and cool (kbb), Atum's horizon is given the qualities that so dominate the horizon of the tree goddess67. The mutual core attribute of life reconstituting space, combined with the regenerating attribute water/coolness analogously experienced from the earliest times in the cosmic gods Atum and Nut, would thus form the conceptual basis for the exchangeability of these deities about 800 years later, in BD 56/59. Writing an image In a discussion on another central iconographic motif in the Egyptian funerary art, the weighing of the heart, Naguib points to the wide range of significance invested in the image: ?Like written texts, images are discursive objects that disclose multiple layers of signification which give way to many levels of understanding... Both illiterate, semi-literate and literate people were capable of appreciating the same 'text', although not in the same 62 See Billing, op.cit., 41-125,157-162. 63 See also N. Billing, in: Z.

On the basis of this passage from the Pyramid Texts, the present author, op.cit., 54, has tentatively argued for the existence of such a correlation already at this early stage of history. 67 See for instance the translations of the texts from the Theban tombs in Billing, op.cit., 247-254.</page><page sequence="15">2004 Writing and Image 49 way"68. We need not here enter into a more exhaustive discussion on the fields of asso ciation promulgated by the funerary texts and images when experienced by the educated elite as compared by the illiterate majority. In a funerary context, one might, however, suppose that in relation to most people the basic-level paradigm of life vs. death had a strong expression in the image of the mother-tree, providing birth, milk, water, provenance, shade etc in the arid mileu of the necropolis. A general view of her as a pars pro toto personification of the garden, ideally found in this region as a part of every tomb, was pro bably also experienced by most spectators69. Nevertheless, below the surface of this imme diate significance there remain to be explored the workings of inner concepts and asso ciations, which governed the exact formulation of a specific tree goddess from the options offered by the general motif. With the established analogies between Atum and Nut, we might then venture on a reconstruction of the redaction that eventually led to the creation of BD 59. The redaction of the Book of the Dead is largely characterised by the extended use of combined text/image compositions. In their editorial treatment of an old text, CT 223/BD 56 and the related CT 222/BD 54, the redactors might have wanted to add an image element in order to enhance the message of Life on behalf of the deceased. The cosmogonic motifs found in this material, with creator-god Atum and the egg in Hermopolis as ultimate sources of life, certainly transmitted a strong rebirth symbolism. The deceased even had the Great Cackler himself enter a union of interdependence with him, where the prosperity of the one was immediately dependent on the other. On the other hand, as seen from the general decorum of Egyptian funerary art, these well-established motifs were obviously not easily trans formed into iconographic form. In this situation the goddess Nut represented an appropriate alternative to Atum. Besides from the set of basic properties that the gods shared since earliest times, not to mention the marked sense of the mother-son relationship that Nut brought with her in a funerary context, the goddess also provided visual means of expression. In the world of the dead there were two principal ?Nut-motifs" to choose from: 1. The prostrating/embracing goddess, giving pictorial expression for the old pss- formula from the sarcophagus chamber 2. Nut in her manifestation of the sycamore. As the first alternative was not easily realised in a BD-vignette, Nut as the tree goddess was the natural choice70. Its conceptual origin in the horizon had rendered the tree a distinctive 68 S.-A. Naguib, in: J. Braarbig/ T. Krogh (eds.), In Search of Symbols. An Explorative Study, 1997, 80. 69 For the decisive importance of an initial identification of genre in the general interpretation of art, see the discussion of H. G. Kippenberg, in: Genres in Visual Representation (Visible Religion VII), 1990, VII-XIX. 70 There are alternative ways of representing Nut in the funerary context, although these scenes are too few in number to be characterised as ?principal motifs". So is the goddess Nut in TT 158 and TT 335 found standing by the tomb in the west (K. Seele, The Tomb of Tjanefer at Thebes, OIP 86, 1959, PL 38; B. Bruyere, Rapport sur les fouilles de Deir el Medineh (1924-1925), FIFAO 3,3, 1926, 144),</page><page sequence="16">50 N. Billing SAK 32 spatial character, and in order to retain the dominant anthropomorphic aspect of the prostrating goddess, a similar version of the tree goddess was chosen. This distinction between the anthropomorphic tree of BD 59 as compared to the more dendromorphing variants of the other spells is, as we have seen above, apparent in the manuscripts of the New Kingdom, and also remains as an observable tendency in the documents of the later periods. In order to fully stress the significance of iconographic expression, we an compare our Nut-tree of BD 59 with the falcon-king metaphor of the Narmer palette, who is given an arm as his only human element, i.e. ?the part of him most relevant for the required semantic value of the metaphor"71. Seen from the perspective of the orporeal embrace of the goddess Nut, the bodily element in the tree goddess composition remained a decisive element that ought to be retained when the motif of the prostrating goddess was transformed into a mother-tree metaphor72. The two major aspects of the tree goddess, identity and iconographic expression, are in BD 59 most consciously formulated within an age-old body-centred conceptual frame, where a corporeal integration communicate a cosmic imagery with the horizon as the ultimate region of birth. Two personified spatial principles, Atum and Nut, were from the earliest times of inscribed royal tombs connected to this sphere of origin, as their bodies were thought to be manifested in the sarcophagus chambers. This body-centred conception of the tomb provided the most immediate expression for rebirth. Although the ideas con cerning the origin of the world which evolved around the creator-god Atum would be given completely other forms of expression than the mythology of the great mother goddess of the sky, their mutual role as parental deities, spatially determined in the pyramid substructures, never fell into oblivion. When the redaction of the Book of the Dead at the turn of the 18th 19th Dynasty, through the rhetoric of the image, wanted to enhance the message of life in BD 56, the old connection between the Heliopolitan gods could appropriately be brought forth from this rich conceptual archive and applied in a new context. as is she in TT 336 also seen involved in the purification ritual of the deceased (Bruyere, op.cit., 95, Fig. 63). 71 Goldwasser, From Icon to Metaphor, 16. 72 In the highly original scene on the roof of the burial chamber of TT 216, Nut is even pictured as a prostrating tree goddess (Billing, op.cit., 265-267, 375 [Fig. C.27]).</page></plain_text>
