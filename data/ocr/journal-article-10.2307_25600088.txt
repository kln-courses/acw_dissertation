<plain_text><page sequence="1">AARON SHEON Multistable Perception in Romantic Caricatures The first decades of the nineteenth century were particularly im portant in optical experimentation, and a few major artists responded to this research, usually showing an interest in color theory. We can cite in this connection Delacroix, Turner, and Constable, and even Poe's writing about anamorphic representations.1 This article concerns a neglected parallel between Romantic caricatures and scientific studies of optics and perception: how caricaturists explored the visual effect called "multistability," which was being investigated by European scientific writers during the period. Caricaturists were more ready to borrow and exploit scientific research than painters, and in this regard they form an important first wave of artistic cu riosity about optics and perception, which was to become so important to the realist and impressionist painters over a half century later. One curious visual effect we notice in the caricature of Louis-Philippe (Fig. l) is our inability to concentrate on all of the faces at the same time. We find ourselves shifting our gaze from one to the other. This effect of the image being perceived in parts or stages is related to a perceptual phenom enon called "multistability." Two famous examples of multistable percep tion give a good idea of what is involved here: in the Rabbit/duck (Fig. 2) we see the two animals alternately. It is virtually impossible to see them both at the same time, and they are usually stable in one interpretation for only a few seconds. Another multistable image is the illustration of My Wife and My Mother-in-Law (Fig. 3), in which the nose of the elderly l. See John Gage, Color in Turner (New York: Praeger, 1969); R.

In both cases we perceive the form alternately. Perceptual psychologists have explained this visual effect on the basis of our present knowledge of the neurological and perceptual structure of the sensory system: An ambiguous figure provides the viewer with an input for which there are two or more possible representations that are quite different and about equally good, by whatever criteria the perceptual system em ploys. When alternative representations or descriptions of the input are equally good, the perceptual system will sometimes adopt one and some times another. In other words, the perception is multistable.2 Although there is no explanation about how the mind simplifies visually complex or in this case ambiguous representations, one author has suggested the following theory: It should be evident. . . that some principle of Pragnanz, or minimum complexity, runs as a common thread through most of the cases [of multistability]. It seems likely that the perceptual machinery is a ideo logical system that is "motivated" to represent the outside world as eco nomically as possible, within the constraints of the input received and the limitations of its encoding capabilities.3 The visual effect of multistability has had considerable attraction for art ists and caricaturists, whether in antique mosaics, mannerist faceties, or early nineteenth-century caricatures. Sixteenth-century Italian artists perhaps made the most creative use of multistable representations. For example, Arcim boldo and his followers made "portraits" of figures seen in profile (Fig. 4) which could also be read as piles of fruit or vegetables. Although the multi stable effect was not exactly balanced, as it is with the Rabbit/duck, we still tend to shift from one reading to the other in sequence. A more complex multistability was developed by the little-known follower of Arcimboldo, G. B. Braccelli, whose work is known from his Bizzarie di varie figure pub lished in 1624. His landscapes showing rows of houses (Fig. 5) or a port city with a fortified wall and hill (Fig. 6) do not at first glance seem visually challenging. Yet as we stare at the shapes we realize that they are stylized reclining figures, and the images become multistable.4 2. Attneave, p. 63.

The print of Winter (Fig. 7), dating from the late sixteenth or seventeenth century, was the type that was widely copied in multistable representations during the Romantic period.5 One variety was popular in France after the overthrow of the mon archy; sympathizers with Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette purchased prints like Uurne mysterieuse (Fig. 8) as a form of posthumous devotion. If we stare at the urn we see that its outline is formed by the profiles of the King and Queen; in the tree above the urn we find the profiles of their children.6 Similar multistable images became the vehicles for anti-Napoleonic state ments in countries conquered by the French armies. In the Germanic states prints such as the bust of Napoleon gripped by the claws of the Prussian eagle (Fig. 9) are reminiscent of the work of Arcimboldo. Here, Napoleon's face is composed of the cadavers of his victims and his vest is spotted with their blood. Another print (Fig. 10) shows soldiers carrying sacks of plunder into the ruin of the "grossen Kaiserburg des Universalmonarchen," which when viewed from the side is a portrait of Napoleon. Related to this Napo leonic "landscape," but more subtle in its anthropomorphism, is a series of landscapes done by Claude Fortier at the turn of the nineteenth century.7 In Figure 11, for instance, we first notice the genre aspects and then perceive the head of the recumbent giant, which tends to become the dominant perception. Around 1820 the lithographer Alois Senefelder published a series of prints entitled Les metiers grotesques, which included La cremiere (Fig. 12), in which the jugs and ladles form a profile that then becomes the dominant percep tion. Charivari in the 1830's ran many illustrations of multistable forms: the pear as Louis-Philippe's symbol was presented as an isolated fruit with flies outlining the eyes, nose, and mouth; a house covered with snow became a human face, or a composition of pipes could be seen as a human body.8 One of the most inventive caricatures of this type was the detail of Louis-Philippe's profile formed by two lifeless tree trunks (Fig. 13), which was reproduced 5.

Although, as we have seen, there are art-historical precedents for this re newed interest in multistable forms in the first half of the nineteenth cen tury, it seems likely as well that artists were alert to scientific studies of the period dealing with the psychology of vision. We know that caricaturists were keenly interested in scientific research in related fields, such as physi ognomy, optics, meteorology, photography, and hypnosis; the new studies about perception and vision were well publicized, and it would be surprising if artists and illustrators did not respond to them with equal enthusiasm.10 Thomas Young was among the first scientists in the nineteenth century to attempt to understand the complex mechanical functioning of the eye. In 1801 he reported in the Philosophical Transactions his experiments with the accommodation mechanism of the eye and how the lens can be used to alter focal distance. A decade later Charles Bell wrote on the varied functions of different parts of the brain and attempted to localize sensory channels. R. Addams in 1834 published his famous study of "after-imagery," an effect he observed when looking at a waterfall. When he shifted his gaze from the rapidly descending water, the rocks nearby seemed to move upward at a velocity equal to the speed of the water. In 1838 Charles Wheatstone com mented on the impossibility of artists' rendering forms in space because of the different perceptual needs of binocular vision. He experimented with stereoscopic devices which presented optical illusions and geometric shapes, hoping to understand how each eye sees a form and how the mind then unifies the binocular effect.11 For the purpose of this study the most well known research on multi stability was by the Swiss author Louis Albert Necker. In the November 1832 issue of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science he published the first scientific study of a multistable representation. He had noticed that a line drawing of a geometric form (Fig. 14), now called the Necker cube, had the tendency to be multistable: 9. The Louis-Philippe/Tree illustration appeared on August 20, 1834, with a slightly modified version in the issue of February 23, 1834. For later examples including illusions by M. C. Escher, see E. H.

This puz zling effect was, of course, difficult to explain?as it still is today. He pro posed the following hesitant interpretation: I have been a long time at a loss to understand the reason of the appar ently accidental and involuntary change which I always witnessed in all sorts of books of crystallography. The only thing I could observe was, that at the time the change took place, a particular sensation was felt in the eyes (for it takes place as well when seen with only one eye, as with both eyes), which proved to me that it was an optical, and not merely as I had at first thought a mental, operation which was performed. After, however, a more attentive analysis of the fact, it occurred to me, that it was owing to an involuntary change in the adjustment of the eye for obtaining distinct vision.13 We know that Necker's conclusion that the phenomenon of multistability was due to the adjustment mechanism of the eye was incorrect. Yet it is sig nificant that the strange visual effect was being studied by scientific writers at the period when caricaturists were equally intrigued by its formal possi bilities.
