<plain_text><page sequence="1">Amos Megged "RIGHT FROM THE HEART": INDIANS' IDOLATRY IN MENDICANT PREACHINGS IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY MESOAMERICA In one of the chapters of his chronicle of the Dominican mission in the province of Chiapa, Mexico, we find the seventeenth-century chronicler Fr. Antonio de Remesal explaining to his readers why he had chosen not to include in his work any account of the idols that existed in the prov- ince before and after the arrival of his brethren to the area: "Even though I was well aware of the necessity to return to deal with the material of the idols, nevertheless, I found it extremely dangerous because of the In- dians' nature, who, more than any other nation in the whole world, are inclined to these things and, discovering them printed and published for the sake of remembering them, it could well be feared that they would easily go back to their abominable practices."l The full meaning behind the above commentary will be closely pur- sued here. During the past decade and concurrent to the Columbian quin- centennial, studies that concentrated on the religious side of Spanish colonization in Mesoamerica have come a long way in refuting the biased and anachronistic claims for a complete and easy Christianization of the Indians by the missionaries, a topic highlighted in Robert Ricard's thesis of the "spiritual conquest."2 They have also proceeded considerably in 1 Fr.

In the use of this term, scholars have obviously restricted them- selves to the end product of the religious phenomenon while neglecting the analysis of the often contradictory and conflicting process of conver- sion and the ways in which this process was accommodated and reinter- preted by the Indians.3 Jorge Klor de Alva was already highly concerned with the dialogue established between missionaries and Indians in Mexico when he pre- sented his elaborate model for describing the Christianization process and its impact on native society and religion.4 His model offers scholars an enriching corpus of definitions that could easily be assimilated into present research to analyze a variety of religious phenomena throughout the process of conversion. The most recent research on these aspects of conversion tends finally to stress the fact that the Indians were not passive observers and mere recipients of conversion but active participants and even initiators of the religious changes in their transformed culture. Their discourse, whether orally transferred through myths or transcribed and translated by the missionaries, and even the missionizing aids themselves, like the early catechisms, very clearly portray active native involvement in the con- version of their cosmology. Dennis Tedlock has stressed this point when he insisted that native sources like the Popol Vuh of the Quiche Maya should be approached dialogically: "To argue that underneath the ve- neer of myths lies the working of a single universal Logus is to vote for the western metaphysics against dialogue."5 The dialogue established 3 See, e.g., Charles Wisdom and Sol Tax ("The Supernatural and Curing'" in Heritage of Conquest: The Ethnology of Middle America, ed. Sol Tax [Glencoe: University of Illi- nois Press, 1952]), who, in turn, both claimed that the Indians themselves were virtually unaware of the complete fusion that occurred between Christianity and their former reli- gion. During the 1960s Mesoamerican scholars using syncretism were clearly influenced by Vittorio Lanternari's classic study, The Religions of the Oppressed: A Study of Modern Messianic Cults (New York: Knopf, 1963); David E.

In two recent impressive works on conversion in Mexico and Peru, Louise Burkhart and Sabine MacCormack employ the dialogical inter- pretation to provide us with a highly sophisticated discussion of the interaction between the missionary European and native mentalities.6 Burkhart is mainly concerned with the endeavor of separating and clas- sifying the different ingredients that make up the native colonial and lo- cal missionary discourses and how they came to be integrated through historical processes into a cultural system "that is more than a simple sum of parts."7 MacCormack, on the other hand, emphasizes the innate confrontation between the two religious traditions when she narrates the Inca and missionary encounters: "Missionary teaching, reinforced by co- ercion and resettlement, led Andeans to reformulate their religious con- cepts but not to drop them entirely."8 The present article closely pursues both these facets of the "dialogical frontier," ensuring Clifford Geertz's applicable statement that "religion, as a cluster of sacred symbols, serves not merely to preserve beliefs and conserve a social order; it also acts as a dynamic cultural system that both motivates and justifies change."9 What I aim in this article is to ana- lyze the interplay between the universalistic conceptions brought by the mendicant friars to sixteenth-century colonial Mesoamerica10 and their transformation by the friars to suit local modes of explaining the diverse phenomena of which the Indians' world of idolatry was made up.

His own interpretation and explanation must have widely influenced the Dominicans' conceptualization of the subject in Meso- america from the middle of the sixteenth century and therefore requires our special attention: Any nation could believe that they possess the unique and only God, thus they should not be obliged to believe that among Christians they would preferably encounter the true God ... and if the adoration of stones in place of gods seems to us contrary to the natural reason of things, those who practice it cannot be ex- cused because the common and ultimate goal of those who adore the idols is not to worship stones but to venerate them, by the form of a religious rite, as if they represented certain divine virtues, of the Creator, whoever he is ... whom they recognize as the one who is able to help them and lead them.... Through these rites they endeavor to reconcile him, primarily by way of sacrifices. 1 In chapter 38 of his apologetics, Las Casas described the Indians' con- cept of idols as the "multiple facets of God." He thus clearly asserted that the idols are only intermediaries between the worshipers and the divine virtues of a creator and therefore that the act of idolatry is not the adoration of stones but rather the veneration of their supernatural representations. In chapter 8 of his apologetics, Las Casas impartially legitimized the practice of idolatry when he argued that the belief in "false gods" and in the "cult of idolatry" was inherent, a necessity that was deeply rooted in human nature, one from which no nation had ever been excluded, and one that could never be absolutely extirpated. Similarly, the early-twentieth- century Protestant theologian Rudolph Otto, in his famous and highly controversial essay, The Idea of the Holy, defined the "numinous" as that without which religion could never be regarded as such.12 In Las Casas's view, idolatry was ever present in all forms of infidelity and could not have been considered a sin, and, therefore, the same reasons for not pun- ishing infidelity could have also been applied in the case of idolatry. By far the greater sin, to his mind, was an intentional resistance to the works of Christianization. Nevertheless, idolatry, for Las Casas as for many other theologians discussing idolatry in the New World during that time, originated out of pure ignorance of the true God and from underestimation of him.13 The understanding of God's ways was therefore beyond the comprehension l Fr.

There were, certainly, no new grounds broken here for the study of the meaning of idolatry for Indians. Contrary to the theoretical, scholarly approach taken by Las Casas in his apologia against Sepulveda, what was predominantly being debated among his followers, the Dominicans in the province of Chiapa, in southern Mexico, who confronted the day-to-day reality of idolatry in their parishes, was the actual meaning of idols. Idolatry in Chiapa during the early years of the mission was, in effect, a public phenomenon, a situation similar to that before the friars' arrival. On special occasions, such as those related to the life cycle and agricul- tural activities, the Indians overtly offered sacrifices of wild dogs, deer, parrots, turtledoves, and other birds to the households' images at their doorways. Those already baptized hid their images in the forest and there, either alone or together with their entire family, celebrated their feasts and kept their fasts.14 In his diary, which dates from the early 1560s, Fr. Thomas de la Torre, for example, comments on the enormous number of idols that existed among his parishioners in Zinacantlan: "And above all, the Quelenes In- dians [Maya-Tzotzil] were obsessed with the idols, more than any other nation of the land ... and the common phenomenon among them was to address any of the idols as God and proclaim that the God of their com- munity was benevolent and another was invaluable, and it was also com- mon for them to conceive the paintings and images adored by the Spaniards as identical to their own adoration of their idols."15 Only a few years after their assignment to the Indian parishes, the Do- minican priests were already well aware of the need to tread very cau- tiously toward an understanding of local phenomena, which they still vaguely regarded as deviant, in order to persuade the Indians of their im- morality. But the fundamental mental obstacle to their understanding of the religious "deviant reality" around them was to be found predomi- nantly in the theological preparation they received back in the monas- teries in Spain. There, the debates on the religion of the native "infidels" concentrated only on the physical manifestations of idols and not on the beliefs behind them or on other religious phenomena present in the New World, such as animism. In this context, it is important to mention that it was only in 1578 that the Jesuit Jose de Acosta's groundbreaking work, Historia natural y moral de las indias, attempted for the first time to introduce into the scholarly theological debate on idolatry three distinct categories by which paganism could be characterized. These categories should have helped his 14 Remesal (n. 1 above), bk. 6, chap. 7. 15 Fr. Francisco Ximenez, Historia de la provincia de San Vicente de Chiapa y Gua- temala, 3 vols. (Guatemala City: Bibliotheca "Goathemala," 1929-31), 1:360, 363. 65</page><page sequence="6">Right from the Heart contemporaries to identify (a) the veneration of natural phenomena (ani- mism), (b) the veneration of animals (totemism), and (c) the veneration of anthropomorphic idols. The latter had been considered by Acosta to be the most advanced, and he linked it directly to the development of the "high" cultures of America.16 By far, the roots of the obstacle to the Spanish priest's work in the In- dian parishes in sixteenth-century Mesoamerica lay significantly in the fact that in the beginning, the Spanish mendicant friars were unable to distinguish between what appeared to them to be mere popular practices, or supersticiones, an open, vague category often applied in their writ- ings, and outright idolatry. Moreover, since the friars were taught in Spain that idolatry could only be practiced in the presence of idols, us- ages such as forms of animism that did not include the worship of dei- ties' images were not initially considered by them to be idolatrous. Thus, when facing the different manifestations of animistic and monistic phe- nomena, the friars perpetually searched for a logical explanation of the nature of local religion according to their Aristotelian-Thomist dogmas. On the local level, incantations, divinations, the wearing of masks on feast days, the blessing of the fields, the enacting of popular myths and legends, and even the practice of sorcery were also often perceived by the inexperienced parish priest as popular practices that could be accom- modated within the penumbra of lay piety. Nevertheless, the priest's impediments on the local level may be com- pared to those on the more universal plane; the sterile confrontation of the colonial church with the phenomena of deviance and apostasy in the New World could well be ascribed to its failure to challenge the same problems among the Christianized Moors in Spain itself. In 1554, Alonso de Montufar, who was to become the Dominican bishop of Mex- ico, was one of the foremost instigators in the Synod of Guadix, Spain, where it was first decided to enforce a variety of Muslim customs. A year later, in the First Mexican Synod of 1555, Montufar proclaimed the Church's need to deal with deviance among the Indians in the same way as that adopted earlier for the Moors.17 This same spirit prevaded the decrees of the Mexican synod, which de- clared that the Indians were now far beyond their initial, pardonable, neo- phytic status and must be regarded as Christians. Hence, the decrees stated that thenceforward the Indians were liable to excommunication and other ecclesiastical punishments as were inflicted on heretics in Europe itself. 16 Anthony Pagden, The Fall of Natural Man: The American Indian and the Origins of Comparative Ethnology (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), pp. 148-87. 17 Antonio Garrido Aranda, Moriscos y indios: Precedentes hispanicos de la evan- gelizacion en Mexico (Mexico City: Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, 1980), pp. 94-104. 66</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions Likewise, the parish priests were instructed that Indians who came under the broad and vague label of hechiceros (witches), sortilejos (magi), and idolaters, as well as those who regularly sought the services of traditional healers, should be punished at first by a long public penitence at the local church or in the nearest town; should they repeat their sins, they would be excommunicated. Furthermore, during saints' days the Indians were forbidden to wear masks or headdresses or to perform their traditional dances. The parish priests were also given orders to proceed against those who did not confess and those who did not attend mass regularly on Sun- days and on the main feasts of the Church.18 These regulations, however, were rarely enforced strictly by most of the parish priests. Therefore, in 1555, at the First Mexican Council, as in subsequent councils, the agenda included the question of punishment and how to en- force it rather than the question of the essence of religious deviance among the Indians. The need for punishment and its efficacy was the ba- sis for the ongoing polemics between Dominicans and Franciscans, as well as within the medicant orders themselves, throughout the period dis- cussed. But when this issue required identification of the different forms of deviance according to their gravity, it was far easier to take punitive measures and to initiate campaigns against deviance than to comprehend its forms better. In the introduction to his famous study on postconquest Mexican reli- gion and social structures, Historia de las indias de Nueva Espana, written in Mexico in 1570, the Dominican chronicler Fr. Diego Duran describes how in many respects the Indians could be compared to the inhabitants of the remotest provinces of Castile, whose "bestiality and rusticity were not to a lesser degree than that of the Indians. These primitive human be- ings, who lived in solitary regions and lacked doctrine, even testified that they had never come to hear even one sermon in all their lives." Their senses, according to Duran, were even too dull and uncouth to identify and characterize the different natural phenomena. Nevertheless, as Duran ex- plains, these Castilians, contrary to the Indians, "would prefer to die be- fore doubting but one of the fundamentals of the Faith." In Duran's view, "there was still hope that the Indians may be able in the future at least to attain the moral standards and faith of the inhabitants of the remotest ham- lets in Spain."19 Duran's introductory comments to his work were aimed at encourag- ing his brethren, but his major goal was to "try and comprehend the roots 18 S.

On Duran's work, see Pagden's superb study, esp. chap. 4. 67</page><page sequence="8">Right from the Heart of Indian beliefs in order to avoid the fusion between the ancient rites and superstitions and our Christian religion." He thus blamed the chap- lains who accompanied the first conquerors in their forays of destruction and looting for burning and extirpating the sacred glyphs and books of the Indians in "inexplicable zeal." Consequently, he says, the agents of Christianization-the friars-were insufficiently equipped to distinguish among the daily forms of heresy that took place before them.20 Duran's comments in 1570 clearly reflect a major issue that concerned the Dominican parish priests, such as those serving in the southern prov- ince of Chiapa, ever since their arrival in that province. From the 1550s onward, they were highly engaged in organizing a body of often contra- dictory information that had accumulated on the culture, modes of exist- ence, and beliefs of the different peoples who inhabited the region. They thereby hoped they would be able to prevent the growing fusion between the old and the new religions, which they conceived as the "work of the devil" aimed at turning the Christian doctrine upside down. The bishops and viceroys were, in effect, the chief promoters of trea- tises that dealt with the nature of religious deviance among the Indians. In 1554, for example, the bishop of Guatemala, Francisco Marroquin, com- missioned one of the senior Dominicans, Fr. Domingo de Vico, to write for him a treatise on the essence of idolatry that would serve as the foun- dation for all future decisions in the colony on the diverse forms of devi- ance and its appropriate punishments. However, if the bishop expected the work to assume the shape of a comprehensive, definitive guide to devi- ance as a whole, it missed its mark. The treatise was in fact a collection of instructions, addressed to the Dominican brethren who served in the Indian communities of Chiapa and Guatemala, in which Vico illustrated to his fellow friars how they were to use local beliefs in their sermons,21 a crucial subject that will be discussed below. Two years later, Juan Mendez, the bishop's ecclesiastical judge, pub- lished an elaborate account of local beliefs and rituals still maintained by the Indians of Chiapa, entitled Sumario de las idolatrias y algunas ceremonias y sacrificios en Soconusco. Mendez stated at the opening of his essay that "it aimed at enriching the Church's knowledge of Indian customs, thus facilitating their extirpation."22 We are told in the sources 20 Duran, 1:3-6. 21 Fr. Domingo de Vico's treatise was entitled Tratado de idolos. That year, he and Fr. Francisco de Viana were the first to compose a manual of sermons in the native languages of Guatemala, written in Quiche or in Cakchi and called Theologia de los indios o indus- triacion de ellos en la fe Catholica por seremones sobre la vida de Cristo, evangelios y fiestas de santos, en lengua indiana (Andre Saint-Lu, La Vera Paz: Esprit evangelique et colonisation, these, memorial et travaux [Paris: Universit6 de Sorbon, 1968], p. 427n). 22 "Informacion de los servicios hechos en la provincia de Guatemala y Soconusco por Juan Mendez, clerigo presbitario, 1562" manuscript in the Archivo General de Indias, Seville, Guatemala, legajo 168, fol. 37r. 68</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions that Mendez's study was circulated among members of the audiencia and the provincials of the three orders (the Dominicans, the Franciscans, and the Mercederians) and was also widely read by Spaniards in the capital of Chiapa, Ciudad Real. Throughout the primary years of their assignment in Chiapa, during the visitas (visitations by assigned priests) to the parishes, the Dominican fri- ars had first made it a custom to publicly denounce whole physical man- ifestations of the old gods by bringing forth the idols themselves and lecturing against the superstitions they represented.23 Avoiding the urgent necessity to first identify local cosmology and thereafter to challenge it, the friars made futile attempts to forcefully omit the misconstrued idolatry without entering into a direct dialogue with their native parishioners. Nevertheless, from the late 1550s onward, we are able to distinguish a unique development in local Dominican thought. In order to provide an appropriate substitute for the idols and to avoid confusing them, uninten- tionally, with corresponding traits of the Catholic patron saints implanted in each of the native colonial communities in Chiapa, the Dominican par- ish priests began the arduous task of studying, sorting out, and identifying the diverse phenomena of idolatry in their different parishes. One of the first signs of this development was manifested in the Do- minican provincial chapter in Coban, in the Vera Paz region, in 1558. The chapter instructed that in every monastery and in each parish church in the province there should be, in addition to the baptismal and marriage records, an account of all the idols of the region "with their names and figures, and the people who worship them, and how many idols there were."24 By June 1573, the urgent requirement of knowing what local "idolatry" meant was pushed forward by a royal decree stating that "the ecclesiastical ministers should be knowledgeable about the idols vener- ated by the Indians since the ancient times of their infidelity, the sacrifices that they offered them and others, in order to free them from their super- stitious errors and vanity and teach them the certitude of our Faith."25 II Undoubtedly, in many ways the Spanish priests in Mesoamerica con- cerned themselves with essences similar to those that troubled sixteenth- century reformist iconoclasts in Europe. As Catholics of the Counter- Reformation era, the Dominican friars in Chiapa were obviously most sensitive to the direct implications of banishing images, since they were well aware of the leading role of the visual senses. Occular symbols of devotion, such as idols, imprinted rituals on the memory and, just like the powerful presence of images, icons, and relics of the Catholic saints or 23 Ximenez, vol. 2, chap. 4. 24 Remesal, bk. 5, chap. 7. 25 Ibid., bk. 10, chap. 8. 69</page><page sequence="10">Right from the Heart the elevation of the Host as a visual depiction of the suffering of Christ, could not be easily abandoned without appropriate substitution. The prin- ciple behind it all was that the depiction signified the meeting of the sacred act and the laity, who through visual manifestations could better comprehend its crucial role in memorizing the sacred. In order to carry through the forceful psychological process of explaining the new faith to the Indians, one certainly could not do without these visual aids. The friars' prolific endeavor during the 1560s and 1570s in the Do- minican province Chiapa was, thus, trying to explain to themselves the distinct phenomena of idolatry as the basis for all future preaching in the parishes. They fully acknowledged the presuppositions, which are today the foundations of all structuralist thought, that natural phenomena, like the practice of animism among the Indians, do not exist in themselves in human perception, without interpretation by men classifying them in a specific direction and framework. Nature was never an object of pas- sive observation by men, but mental processes convert nature into cul- tural structures that are embodied in local religion. Brought up on the Aristotelian-Thomist teachings in Salamanca and on Las Casas's great ethnographic account, the Apologetica historia, the fri- ars of Chiapa understood that the same religious and natural phenomena could thus be interpreted into diverse forms in different societies, as Las Casas had widely claimed in his works,26 but that behind these unique interpretations existed a logic that had to be sought. In 1566, in one of the Dominican chapters in Coban, Guatemala, Fr. Domingo de Ara, one of the first group of friars to arrive in Chiapa, de- scribed to his brethren how for the past eleven years he had carefully probed into Maya ancient beliefs and oral traditions in the Maya-Tzeltal community of Copanahuastla in Chiapa, "so that the Indians could more easily be convinced of their errors."27 The inescapable need for coop- eration with the local population in the shaping of their new religious consciousness had by then opened new avenues for a thriving dialogue between friars and Indians. By far the most valuable sources for the deconstruction of the friars' construal of the meaning of "idolatry" in Chiapa during that period are the etymological studies, or dictionaries of native languages (artes), as well as the sermons in local dialects, compiled during the 1560s and 1570s in the area by individual friars. In view of the need to establish uniformity with regard to these studies, in 1561 Fr. Francisco de Cepeda traveled to Mexico City, where he published an edited version of the ear- liest dictionaries compiled in the province, from the Chiapanec, Zoque, 26 On this point, see Pagden, pp. 121-23. 27 Remesal, Historia, bk. 2, chap. 12. 70</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions and Zinacantec parishes. The published forms were then circulated among all the serving friars in the province and brought to the local in- habitants' attention.28 I should emphasize here that, for the first time, those studies very strongly portrayed the effort to penetrate local traditional conceptions and perceptions in order, on the one hand, to transform them into notions meaningful for the authors themselves and, on the other, to serve the pur- pose of conveying the Catholic message in local forms that would be comprehended by the newly faithful. III Among the most notable examples of these etymological-ethnographic studies are those of Ara, who was the parish priest of the Maya-Tzeltal community of Copanahuastla, in the southwestern part of the region. Ara, who arrived in Copanahuastla in the summer of 1545, was the former su- perior of the monastery La Fuente Santa de Galisteo in Spain and a grad- uate of theology from the University of Salamanca (1534). In 1572, it was proposed that he replace the deceased bishop of Chiapa, Las Casas, but, unfortunately, he died before the appointment could take place.29 The two dictionaries studied here had both been composed by Ara around 1560 as a result of his intimate experiences while residing in the parish for the past fifteen years. One is Ara's Spanish-Tzeltal Arte de la lengua Tzendal, a copy of which is preserved in Tulane University's Latin American Collection. The other is his Tzeltal-Spanish dictionary Vocab- ulario en lengua Tzendal, owned by the University Museum of the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania and copied from the original by Fr. Alonso Guzman, who was assigned to the Maya-Tzeltal parish of Guaquitepeque in the 1620s.30 In composing his dictionaries, Ara was obviously attempting to set the different native phenomena around him in order-to select and clas- sify the beliefs, attitudes, and private impressions that he had witnessed throughout his prolonged and direct dialogue with native parishioners. He was trying to infiltrate their consciousness and their daily modes of behavior, speech, and style in order to eradicate his own and his brethren's misconceptions and prejudices concerning native culture. Ana- lyzing those dictionaries, we thus need to concentrate more on his modes of classification and description than on the objects included in the 28 Ibid., bk. 7, chap. 16. 29 Ibid., bk. 11, chap. 1. 30 Domingo de Ara, Arte de la lengua Tzendal, ca. 1560, copy in the Latin American Collection, Tulane University, New Orleans, and Vocabulario en lengua Tzendal, copied ca. 1620 by Alonzo Guzman, copy in the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. 71</page><page sequence="12">Right from the Heart entries. It is important to note what categories he employed for sorting out the different essences and how he deconstructed his parishioners' world. Our aim is not to reconstruct native society as it was "before the Span- ish conquest" but rather to delve into how Ara saw and interpreted it in his time. In addition to these two dictionaries, we examine the unique and il- luminating collection of Ara's sermons delivered during the 1560s in his parish. Since, in the Dominican order especially, reading sermons from the pulpit was traditionally considered degrading,31 Ara composed each sermon before delivering it by heart to his local audience. Later he com- piled and classified them according to subject, with a proper index at the end of the collection.32 Apart from the sermons themselves, this collec- tion also included a thorough ethnographic probe by Ara into Maya- Tzeltal kinship terminology, taxonomy of local flora and fauna, local methods of animal raising, and the Maya-Tzeltal syntax. What were the major issues that concerned Ara and his brethren in the Dominican parishes of Chiapa and that are revealed in their works during this period? If we turn at first to Ara's two dictionaries, they reflect a par- ticular stress on a great variety of entries applied to describe the Maya traditional ceremonies, their calendar, and the magical and punitive prac- tices that still persisted in the Maya parishes at that time. Ara's etymology deals with matters that are inseparable from the do- main in which supernatural sanctions were still imposed by traditional practitioners to retain their control over the community. It is, therefore, not surprising to find a great variety of entries dedicated to those practices of magical healing, countermagic, and witchcraft. Looking at the specific entries for the theme of healing, we find a va- riety of activities ranging from benevolent specialities, such as "setting the bones right" (toghotsel baqueletic); "herbalist" (gnapox), "prayer making" (chuybil), "miracle making" (laban), and "those who cast lots" (Jk'in tayej vinic), to malevolent powers stemming from the same roots as the above, such as lab xquil (a rascal in want of evil), ghpoxtaz (to be- witch), xoch poximal (to castigate), and, finally, xchogh (to drill, or cast evil upon another). The common root, laban, comes into Maya from the Nahuatl, and its meaning is "those of powerful spirits." Laban was, like- 31 On this point, see Helen M.

These associations could, nevertheless, be identified in surviving present- day conceptions among the Maya of Chiapas, in which curers are envis- aged as possessing both malevolent and benevolent powers, which are embodied in their souls. Malevolent, godly attributes of the Cha'vuc (Lord of Lightening) are, likewise, directly linked with the most destruc- tive souls of the powerful curers.35 Ara's two dictionaries devote special entries to the traditional sacrifi- cial activities in the parish still performed during his time at particular ceremonial sites described as Sta jib (the place where they mutilate, the place where they kneel). They included, for example, the sacrifice of human eyes (Xcupob Chicinil) and the sacrifice of birds (Jcup tuluk). However, what concerns us more here is his emphasis on the variety of idols in front of which they were performed. In his Spanish-Tzeltal dic- tionary, under the entry "idolatry" we find a number of meanings and at- tributes linked with unique ritualistic characteristics. "Idol," in itself, is classified as vinic ton (stone effigy) or vinic te (wooden effigy). The per- formance of idolatry is specified as qchuhunte (to venerate wood), qchu- hunton (to venerate a stone), ghco'po te ton (speaking to the stone), or qchuhun vitz (to adore a mountain), the latter clearly referring to the practice of animism. Other particular ritual activities associated with idolatry included idols impersonated by the deity impersonators, for example, what is de- scribed as Chavuc xc'opoj (speaking in the name of the thunderbolt). Communication with the traditional deities, in this way, was possibly carried out by the deity's spirit inspiring the practitioner, who would stand behind a screen and transmit to this audience the godly messages. Sometimes the practitioner would merge several unseen, supernatural beings into a single personification. 33 Robert Carmack, Toltec Influence on the Post-Classic Cultural History of Highland Guatemala, Middle American Research Institute, no. 26 (New Orleans: Tulane University, 1968). 34 Burkhart (n. 6 above), p. 57. 35 Calixta Guiteras-Holms, "Informe sobre Bachajon" (paper presented at the second Chicago-Chiapas seminar, December 15-20, 1960), p. 191; Alfonso Villa-Rojas, "Notes on Oxchuk," Tulane University Latin American Library, Middle America Cultural An- thropology microfilm collection, 1947a, p. 574; Megged, fieldwork in Oxchuk, Chiapas, 1980-82. 73</page><page sequence="14">Right from the Heart In the Popol Vuh of the Quiche Maya we find a clear depiction of this ancient Maya practice: "And they prostrated themselves before the idols, there in the forest. And their magical image spoke again when the thun- der came."36 In the nineteenth century, in the course of the caste war in Yucatan, the leader and priest of the millennarian movement, "the Talk- ing Cross" passed instructions to his soldiers in the same traditional manner. Gods themselves are rarely mentioned in the two dictionaries. In the Spanish-Tzeltal dictionary, under the entry "gods" we find the ex- pressions "god the trickster" (taghimal chuhi) and "god of counterfeit" (pactay qchuh) aligned with their antithesis, the entry "divinity" which is literally translated into Tzeltal as "essence of god" (xdiosil), retaining the Spanish pronunciation of God. "Words of God" is similarly entered as both Diosil co'p and chu'lchan c'op, the latter literally meaning "sky's speech." When specifying the particular gods "formally venerated" in his par- ish, Ara explains that "it is a complicated matter" but goes on to include the divine couple, or creator gods, the Engendress, Alaghan (a particular goddess who was the creator of whole), and Patol (the primogenitor of all).38 In this last example, there is, however, no mention by Ara of the etymological significance of the god's name. Apart from these two, Ara names three particular devils: Pucugh, Pozlan, and Quicin. He uses the adjectives quicinil and pucughil to denote "diabolical essences." Those three figures, among whom is Pozlan, or Poxlan, which literally means "healer," could well have impersonated divine attributes associ- ated with distinct Maya beliefs in magic and the malignant souls of the traditional healers. The most powerful among them was believed to appear in the form of a fireball.39 Moreover, bearing in mind the con- temporary reality in his parish, where traditional practitioners of healing and magic were still very much able to employ supernatural powers against individuals in their local calpultin wards, it is quite clear that Ara considered it of great importance to counter the predominant position of 36 On the deity impersonators in Maya tradition, see also Munro S.

He therefore challenged them in his discourse, using diverse depictions of demonological potencies, a technique that is dis- cussed below. IV Reading through Ara's sermons delivered in Copanahuastla between 1546 and 1570, we find them to be an invaluable source for the study of the direct dialogue established between him and his audience in the parish church, through which he uncovered the Indians' world of idolatry and by which a host of local and traditional concepts and perceptions were then skillfully exposed and assimilated. Educated in the great Thomist tradition, Ara was keen to use sum- mae of examples and similitudes in his sermons, applying Maya imag- ery so as to transform the theme of the sermon into local forms and meaning while preserving its Catholic substance. Analyzing the structure and essence of metaphors, Max Black has characterized them as possessing two distinct subjects-a principal sub- ject and a subsidiary one. These subjects can best be conceived of as a "system of things" and the metaphor selects, emphasizes, suppresses, and organizes features of the principal subject by implying statements about it that normally apply to the subsidiary subject.40 Having carefully studied local beliefs, forms, and socioeconomic struc- tures, Ara likewise adopted diverse metaphors from the local domain of the Maya-Tzeltal household and from the cyclical activities of local agri- culture in order to convey the principles of the Christian doctrine. The act of confession, which was conceived by the Maya as an act of spiritual cleansing before major ceremonies and was thought to purify the body of sin,41 is given particular attention in Ara's rhetoric, emphasizing the transformation into a pure form and essence that occurs throughout the process of "a flawless" conversion into the new faith. Writing on the ample uses of the Nahua dichotomy of purity and pol- lution in the rhetoric of the friars working among the Nahuas of Mexico, Burkhart has stated that "the friars found here a means of expressing their ideas of good and evil, moral and immoral, in terms which seemed to con- cord with the friars' own concepts of purity and impurity."42 A very simi- lar application is to be found in Ara's sermons among the Maya-Tzeltal of Chiapa. Portraying the essence of the spirit, Ara compares it to the newly born maize plant, nurtured by means of the powers that God granted it; the clearing and fencing of the milpa is applied as a metaphor 40 Max Black, Models and Metaphors: Studies in Language and Philosophy (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1962), p. 232. 41 J.

A person in search of the inner nature of his soul is compared in the sermons to an Indian merchant in search of treasures, and in direct relationship to the Maya concept of the "ill" soul, the parishioners are called upon to trust God as the only healer and confessor of their souls.43 The act of confession in Ara's sermons is clearly linked with local traditional confessions and reprimand mentioned in his dictionaries. The Maya-Tzeltal dictionary has a number of references to methods of healing that involved confessions and reprimand in the presence of a panel of elders-specialists who endeavored to define the sin that caused the patient's illness, chictal mulil (the sin's presence), through the "reading of the blood" (Spic chihch or spic c'abal). The core of Ara's works, however, brings to light what was especially troubling for the Spanish friars in Chiapa and elsewhere-the study of Maya monistic dualism between malevolent and benevolent forces and the impressions of that dualism on the contemporary Maya thought of their parishioners. In the middle of the sixteenth century, Neoplatonic Catholicism envi- sioned good and evil as discontinuous and in complete opposition, forever struggling against one another for dominion over humanity. For theolo- gians and parish priests, the origins of evil were identified with the body and the material world, and as a force of inertia on the good. The sources of the benevolent were, in comparison, associated with the psyche, the uncorrupted heavenly spirit.44 As early as the third and fourth centuries, the church fathers vigor- ously attacked the Gnostic sects for their spiritual venture into the sources of the problem of evil,45 and their conclusion was that evil was not an abstraction or a passive condition but a positive and violent force arising from the active operation of Satan and his archons.46 For the Gnostics, the worldly was actually a substitute for hell ruled by demons and was the spirit's (pneuma) prison. Ever since, concise lines had been drawn in the Christian dogma sep- arating the two polar oppositions. A close relationship between heaven and earth was therefore conceptualized as exclusive, if not impossible. 43 Ara, Opus Frati Dominica (n. 32 above), fols. 3v, 8r, 76v, 126r. 44 Simone Petrement, Le dualism chez Plato ...

Maya monistic conception of the ambiguous affiliation between the upper world and underworld was therefore a constant cause for concern among Ara and his brethren when trying to transform it into its conflicting Christian counterparts. What was the Maya conceptualization of the universe? The Maya highlighted close and unbreakable ties between the abode of the earth and the heavenly powers. The divine reality was, at the same time, one and many, multiple and fluid, encompassing the whole, and its aspects were changing images that were constantly redefined. Therefore, it could in time also quite easily accommodate Christian imagery into its flexible pantheon. Caves, water holes, natural reservoirs (cenotes), and volca- noes were the doors to heaven on earth, and there was a nondualistic unity between the benevolent and malevolent divine attributes.47 In one of the most prominent of the early colonial Maya sacred books, The Chilam Balam of Chumayel, we find an extract focusing on the battle that raged between two distinct groups of deities over dominion of the two worlds. The author describes the great sin of the nine lords of the underworld, who had taken over the territory of the sky by blinding their rulers, the thirteen-sky lords. This act had substantially shaken the bal- ance between the two worlds and resulted in annihilation and the coming of deluge. In the proceeding extract, the author accounts for the birth of the Itzam-cab-ain, the earthly alligator whose role was to mediate "as an angel, between earth and heaven."48 And in the Chilam Balam of Tiz- imin, there is a parallel account of how, while the thirteen-sky deities' rule was threatened from time to time by the earth monster, there was room for coexistence. The two divine rival groups would pay occasional visits to each other's territory.49 The perception of good and evil among the Maya was, therefore, closely tied with the monistic depiction of the cosmic order. The terri- torial identification of the good in the sky and the evil in the abode of the underworld was flexible and constantly changing. The coexistence be- tween the two groups of deities ruling the earth and the sky presented a 47 See also J.

Ara's sermons, as well as particular entries in the dictionaries-for example, the entry for chicoton (to burn, to compress, as in hell)-pay fastidious attention to the realm of the Maya underworld, which is trans- formed into the Christian hell; pre-Columbian concepts of the afterlife are aligned with the Christian doctrine of death and resurrection, and the notions of sin are related to Catholic confession and penance.50 What is actually conveyed is a structure made up of pairs of antithet- ical oppositions formed for the sake of the local audience into a two- dimensional picture separating the moral and benevolent from the immoral and polluted. Examining Ara's dictionaries, we are able to iden- tify the contrast between pollution (iloalzba) and cleanliness (pocbil) recorded in a relatively large number of entries that render particular representations. Pollution is thus defined as ilozquil (to execrate), ilomaghel (men- strual blood), ilob ihcti or il ya vocol ihcti (lunacy, madness, as in hell), and lab ilob zba (loathsome, impure, and tormented soul). Mary Doug- las has already shown how the notions of pollution are closely associ- ated with death and madness in African societies: "Ritual conserves sanity and life: madness brings filth and is a kind of death. Ritual sep- arates death from life: 'the dead, if not separated from the living bring madness on them.' '51 Behind the attributes given in Ara's dictionaries to cleanliness lay what Victor Turner has described as "the notions of harmony, continuity, purity, the manifest, the public, the appropriate, and the legitimate."52 The picture, delivered in the most straightforward manner, however, could well have been reinterpreted by the same audience in far more am- biguous terms than was originally intended by the preacher. But Ara was already well aware of that danger. Emphasizing Maya-Tzeltal gods of death and the underworld in the sermons was, therefore, not surprising; it was particularly suitable given the priest's endeavor to demonize them in the eyes of his parishioners.53 For example, in one of his sermons we find Ara preaching in the Maya- Tzeltal language that 50 Compare with Garcilaso de la Vega's preoccupation with the Incas' conception of the afterlife; he argued that the Incas had laid a groundwork for even the most exalted of Christian doctrines (MacCormack [n. 6 above], p. 367). 51 Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger: An Analysis of the Concepts of Pollution and Taboo (London: Routledge, 1989), p. 176. 52 Victor Turner, "Colour Classification in Ndembu Ritual," in Anthropological Ap- proaches to the Study of Religion, ed.

He calls upon the head of the household, shakes his house and its inhabitants, and terrorizes the people who reside in the headtown (cabecera).... His power is manifest every moment in every path, on every road. Each day the struggle continues with the Underworld. The devil takes hold through his servants [the household deities] when it [the soul] is close to the hour of death and embraces us on the path where we die. He will then choose us, burning our souls, turning us into ground bones, exposed to the carnal sin, leaving us to be doomed in his moistured mouth, bathing in his great delight, letting one's own doom arrive. Doomsday visions in Ara's sermons were followed by his explanation of how to overcome the devil through the application of the latter's ex- ternal sources of evil: "With sin [itself] we shall entangle the devil in the midst of his act of corrupting the young lads, turning him to ashes. We shall then all end up in the Heart of Benevolence with our Guardian."54 There is no doubt that those particular sermons that dealt with heaven, earth, the underworld, and purgatory left their distinct and recognizable impressions on the oral traditions formulating during the early colonial period in the Maya parishes of Chiapa. Maya concepts of death and the destiny of the soul (as mentioned above in the sermon), the soul's pas- sage through the underworld, and the grinding of the bones in the mythological river55 are particularly useful for us in analyzing the pro- cess that they underwent in Ara's sermons. V The Christian meaning behind the belief in the resurrection of the dead- the restoration of the departed souls into bodily life in a renewed form for those who are saved in heavenly life at the Second Coming of Christ (Parousia)-occupied a crucial place in Ara's sermons to his Maya- Tzeltal parishioners of Copanahuastla and his study of the meaning of local idolatry. The explanation for it is, no doubt, linked with the ever present reality of epidemics, droughts, hunger, and death in the parish of Copanahuastla as in, for example, 1564.56 The outbreaks of smallpox, influenza, measles, pulmonary plague, and exanthematic typhoid every few years since the first contacts with the Spanish conqueror, and their shattering consequences on the local parish population,57 had led the death-stricken Indian parishioners to seek comfort in what Christianity 54 Ara, Opus Frati Dominica (n. 32 above), fols. 109r, 126v; my translation from Maya-Tzeltal. 55 On this concept, see, e.g., Edmonson, trans.

The treatment of death, the threat of purgatory and hell for those who sinned, and the resurrection and salvation of the soul for those destined for paradise were, therefore, particularly stressed by the parish priest in his sermons and took diverse forms in metaphors and imagery. Search- ing through Ara's two dictionaries, we are able to trace numerous entries related to this theme, and later used in the sermons, divided into binary oppositions between benevolent and malevolent destinies. Paradise, for example, is portrayed as nichinaghibal qu'inal (the place of glory) or butz'an nighibal qu'inal (the place of glorious purity). Heavenly resur- rection (cuxul) is depicted as a pure and saintly essence that would not be manifested in the church building itself (cuxul, naxtalan ta iglesia) but in the place of grace (utz'ilal) and mercy (cuxulabi.bahil), where the souls would be received forever under his judgment (cuxul c'otan, inde toghel tzac). Franciscan friars working among the Mixteca in southwest Mexico ap- plied methods similar to those of Ara, using the late medieval image of the ship of fools to demonstrate the fate of the sinful. One of them, Fr. Gonzalo Lucero, thus painted a picture on the upper part of which two canoes carrying Indian men and women sail across a lake toward glory. Devils try to obstruct the Indians by clinging to the sides of the canoes, but the angels protect them, and the devils are finally defeated. In the lower part of the painting, there is another canoe in which devils accom- pany drunk and quarrelsome Indians. The angels try to persuade the In- dians to abandon their evil ways, but with no apparent success. The canoe's wreck clearly depicts the fate of the misguided.58 Hell is allotted two different names in Ara's two dictionaries: Tzan- tantun, which Ara does not translate but which literally means in Tzeltal "pursuing severe reprehension and ashes," and Catinbahc, "the place where the bones are ground." Ara depicts hell as "the place where those who had either breached the fasts or committed adultery with married women or with a slave ended up without leaving any children behind."59 The afterlife is divided between the "malevolent life," which is full of pains and predetermined for the sinful and which Ara defines as "di- abolic" (pucughil), and the "benevolent life," which is full of heavenly delights (butz'hilal) destined for those who followed the right track, which means that they kept the fasts and did not fornicate.60 His con- 58 Ricard (n. 2 above), p. 106.

Conclud- ing his description, Landa commented that "the Maya were never con- cerned with bodily resurrection."61 When looking at Ara's dictionaries, as well as his compilation of ser- mons, we find his explanations of resurrection substantially based on the Christianization of the original Maya-Tzeltal concepts of death and the destiny of the souls of the deceased. This process was clearly devised in order to make his audience far more attentive to the transferred message. Thus, for example, in the entry for hell, in addition to the particular meaning denoting the malevolent facet of the afterlife, there is a sentence in which Ara explains the term as "the place where the bones are burnt." Here, Ara clearly relied on the ancient Maya tradition of the souls' jour- ney after death and their bodily resurrection. This belief is to be found, for instance, in a particular paragraph of the Popol Vuh of the Quiche. The gods are portrayed there as preparing a stone oven for the mytho- logical hero-twins, Hunter and Jaguar-Deer, in which their bones were ground into ashes and then submerged into the bottom of a river running between two mountain peaks; there their souls reappeared.62 The relationship between the upper and lower worlds, as expressed in the concept of the soul's destiny, was manifest among the Maya-Lacandon of Chiapas in the beginning of the twentieth century. According to their version, all the souls of the deceased arrive at first in the underworld but only for a short while. Later, they all proceed through a number of layers in the sky, where they survive perpetually. However, the souls of those who had died in the battlefields or of women who had died during child- birth reach this place in the sky without having passed through Mitnal.63 A version closer to the early colonial depictions in Ara's sermons is nar- rated today in the Maya-Tzeltal community of Oxchuk in Chiapas. In this contemporary oral tradition, a husband is described as setting off on a vain search for his lost wife. Near a river, the guardian deity tells him that it is no use looking for her because he will not be able to recognize her soul's new form. Then God explained the wife's "trail": carrying her bones on 61 Bishop Diego de Landa, Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan, trans. Alfred M.

There, only the charcoal survived, which was then washed into a huge water basin, in which his wife's soul was revived.64 We can thus clearly identify here a ritual reenacting the soul's jour- ney after death and its resurrection, a belief that is also embodied in the contemporary Tzeltal custom of the parents' taking the newly born child immediately following the act of the Christian baptism to the household sweat bath (Catinab, pus), where his immature soul would penetrate his body.65 The friars' ability to transfer those Maya spatial and temporal notions linked with death and the afterlife into the Catholic essence of purga- tory, heaven, and hell obviously could never had been possible without a direct dialogue with their parishioners, who closely assisted them in this endeavor. Learning to make the proper selection between what to accommodate and what to leave behind was, therefore, an enduring pro- cess that involved both partners in this dialogue, friars and Indians alike. While studying local idolatry and using it to suit their particular goals, the mendicant parish priests in sixteenth-century Mesoamerica quickly realized that pure forms of the new religion would forever have stum- bled on the many open wounds of the conquest and submission to the Castilian rulers and the Catholic Church. Therefore, the trial and error of religious changes from within, "right from the heart," became the foremost substitute for physically extirpating idols and punishing the deviants.
