Within these communities a remarkable tra dition of lutherie, or stringed instrument making, has flourished since the end of the nineteenth century. Although at first these local workshops continued to build traditional violins, mandolins, and guitars, they also adapted to changes in musical tastes by producing newer types of instruments. Since the 1930s Italian American makers from this tradition have become especially well known for their archtop guitars, a version of the instrument that borrows heavily from the design of the violin. And the archtop guitars made by three master crafts men working in and around the city—John DAngelico (1905-1964), James D'Aquisto (1935—1995), and John Monteleone (born 1947)—stand apart for their superb quality of sound, their beauty, and their often innovative designs. All three of these New York makers have had a profound influence on the musical world. John DAngelico trained in the mandolin and violin tradition with Italian immigrants, and as markets and musical styles changed he applied his traditional skills to building archtop guitars that would set the standard for subsequent generations. James DAquisto worked first with DAngelico in an old world-style apprenticeship in the heart of New York's Little Italy and later in several locations on Long Island, refining the instrument and introducing his own ideas about sound production and aesthetics. John Monteleone, from the Long Island town oflslip, is a self-trained luthier who first gained promi nence for his innovations in the design of the mandolin. Decades of honing his craft and studying the work of other great luthiers, including his friend James DAquisto, have made him one of today's most eminent guitar makers, and he continues to experiment with new ideas about instrument making. The work of these three luthiers is firmly rooted in the long history of Ital ian, particularly Neapolitan, stringed instrument making. Naples was famous for its mandolin makers, who built instruments suited to the musical styles of</page><page sequence="3">southern Italy. But it was also a center for violin making, and builders there made significant contributions to the design of the guitar as well. The Neapolitan school was predated by, and developed from, the great cen ters of lutherie that had flourished for many centuries in northern Italy, especially in Venice, Padua, Bologna, Milan, and Cremona. From the late eighteenth through the nineteenth century, however, Naples dominated the production of stringed instru ments on the Italian peninsula. Then, in the decades around the turn of the twentieth century, along with millions of other southern Italians, Neapoli tan luthiers emigrated to the United States, and many of them established themselves in the New York region. Viewing the work of modern mas ters like D'Angelico, D'Aquisto, and Monteleone against the backdrop of the extensive holdings of Italian and Italian American stringed instruments in The Metropolitan Museum of Art offers an extraordinary opportunity to consider both the continuity of a traditional craft and its constant adaptation to meet the ever-changing needs of musicians and markets. The juxtaposition of the modern instru ments, primarily guitars, with the products of earlier Italian traditions also highlights the relationships between seemingly quite different types of stringed instruments. The Museum's collection represents more than four hundred years of Italian craftsmanship and includes master pieces from several northern Italian classical schools, a number of highly important Neapolitan plucked instru ments, and a significant group of instruments by the Italian immigrants from whom the master American archtop makers trace their lineage. The craftsmen who build bowed (violins, viols) or plucked (guitars, mandolins, lutes) stringed instru ments are known as luthiers. The word derives from the French luth, or lute. The Italian word is liuteri. Luthiers possess the skills to produce a variety of instruments, although they often specialize in a specific type or family of instruments. Although stringed instruments have been used since ancient times (see fig. i), little is known about the craftsmen who built them in Europe before about the beginning of the sixteenth century. Earlier than that, musical instruments were probably but one of a variety of products made by highly skilled craftsmen. A rare stringed instru ment built in northern Italy in the early fifteenth century survives in the Museum's collection (fig. 2). The small instrument, which was prob ably plucked, has a flat top with a large decorative rosette in the center and a sickle-shaped pegbox, which has five holes for pegs to tune the five strings that would have passed over the soundboard and bridge (now lost) and been fastened to small holes at the tail of the instrument.

As instrumental music changed from monophony (a single melody line) toward polyphony (two or more parts) in the fifteenth century, the more complex music and new perfor mance techniques led to innovations in the design of musical instruments and to a need for specialized crafts men to build them. Lute players switched from using a plectrum to play a single melodic line to a finger plucking style that allowed them to perform multiple parts. More strings were added to the lute: a fifth and sixth course (pair) of strings in the fifteenth century, and a seventh (or sometimes more) in the sixteenth century. The center for the production of these newer instruments, which are now known as Renaissance lutes, was in Bavaria, in and around the town of Füssen in the Lech Valley. The region was well suited to lute manufacturing, with an abundance of slow-growth forests supplying the raw materials to build the instruments and a position along the Via Claudia Augusta, the ancient trading route that crossed the Alps, linking Augsburg and Venice. Lute making was well established in the area by the middle of the fifteenth century, and several prominent fami lies of makers were working there by 1500. In 1562 a guild was founded in Füssen to regulate workshops like the one recorded in a woodcut of 1568 (fig. 4). A beautiful south German lute in the Metropolitan was built in Augs burg in 1596 by Sixtus Rauchwolff, a lute maker for the powerful Fugger family (fig. 5). The lute has a back of twenty-five ebony or rosewood ribs with ivory spacers between them. Orig inally made for seven or eight courses of strings, in the nineteenth century it was fitted with frets and six strings to allow it to be played as a guitar. The vast majority of lutes from the Lech Valley were made for export, especially to the wealthy cities of northern Italy, and in order to bet ter capitalize on these markets many Bavarian makers moved to Venice, Padua, Bologna, and other Italian cit ies, where they found easier access to exotic materials such as ebony, ivory, and snakewood while retaining proximity to the wood of the Bavarian forests. The early émigrés included Luca Maler, who was in Bologna by 1518, and Ulrich Tieffenbrucker, who was building instruments in Venice by 1521. Many more craftsmen moved south after guild restrictions in Füs sen limited the number of workshops in Bavaria. And a series of wars fought 4. Jost Amman (Swiss, 1539-1591, active in Germany).

The Bavarian luthiers thrived in Italy, and the traditions they established in cities throughout the north would continue for centuries. The Museum's collection includes a number of instruments by Bavarian makers who worked in northern Italy. The earliest may be a lute from the late sixteenth century that is attrib uted to the Paduan Wendelin Tieffen brucker. A lute Pietro Railich of Padua built in 1669 (fig. 6) has a back made of twenty-one snakewood ribs. Like nearly all seventeenth-century lutes, it was later modified to stay current with changing musical fashions, in this case by Anton Fichtl of Vienna, who gave it an extended "swan neck" in 1720. The most impressive of the Museum's lutes is an archlute by David Tecchler of Rome (fig. 7), who was most famous as a violin maker.

The Metropolitan also has an exquisite guitar that was likely built by Matteo Sellas, a member of a promi nent family of luthiers in Venice, in about 1630-50 (fig. 8). The guitar is embellished with engraved bone plaques, inlaid bone and snakewood geometric designs, and a tiered parchment rosette. The vaulted back is made of scalloped snakewood ribs with ivory spacers. Another guitar (fig. 9) was probably made by Giacomo Ertel of Rome in the late seventeenth century. The back and sides of this beautiful instrument are decorated with a checkerboard pattern of bone, ebony, and fruitwood; the top is edged with small mother-of-pearl squares inlaid with strips of ebony; and the fingerboard and peghead are inlaid with large mother-of-pearl medallions. By the beginning of the sixteenth century other lutherie traditions had also formed on the Italian peninsula. Luthiers in the Lombard towns of Brescia and Cremona, in particular, were known for their bowed stringed instruments, especially of the violin family. The violin did not fully achieve its modern dimensions and form— arched top (carved) and back, rounded shoulders, and four strings on an unfretted fingerboard—until the middle of the sixteenth century in the workshop of Andrea Amati in Cre mona. Amati was also probably the creator of the other members of the violin family (viola and violoncello), perhaps as part of a set of thirty-eight instruments said to have been built for King Charles IX of France in about 1560. Surviving instruments by Amati are exceedingly rare. An Amati violin in the Metropolitan that could also date to about 1559 (figs. 10-12) may have been built for the Spanish court of Philip II on the occasion of his marriage to Elisabeth of Valois, sister of Charles IX. It has the remnants of a painting on its back that includes fleurs-de-lis (for the house of Valois), and on its ribs is the motto "Quo unico propugnáculo stat stabitq[ue] religio" (By this bulwark alone reli gion stands and will stand). Amati established the renowned Cremonese school of lutherie, which would include several generations ofAmati's family, members of the Guarneri family, and Antonio Stradi vari.

Private collection large-scale workshops the number of luthiers was severely reduced. Major changes in music itself, some of which brought about the near obsolescence of the lute, also affected the demand for instruments. Then too, makers in other European cities vied for a share of the clientele, and on the Italian peninsula the center of stringed instru ment making eventually moved south to Naples. By the second half of the eigh teenth century Naples was the largest city in Italy and the third most popu lated in Europe. It was known as a center for music, especially opera, and its musical instrument makers had been famous for their fine harp sichords since the sixteenth century. The beginnings of an important lutherie tradition in Naples can be traced to Alessandro Gagliano, who was a native of the city and is believed to have spent significant time in the late seventeenth century as an apprentice, probably in Nicolò Ama ti's workshop in Cremona. Gagliano, who established his own workshop in Naples in about 1700, is the earli est known Neapolitan violin maker. His work is generally considered less refined than that of the Cremonese makers with whom he studied, yet a stunning violin he made in 1704 (fig. 16), with distinctive f-holes and a beautiful two-piece back, demon strates his skill and creative style. Alessandro established a family of luthiers that would remain active in Naples well into the nineteenth cen tury (see fig. 17). Neapolitan makers' contributions to the design of plucked stringed instruments are of great importance. In the 1740S members of the Vinaccia family created what would become the classic Neapolitan version of the mandolin. The Vinaccia made a sub stantive change to the structure of the instrument by canting the top, or soundboard, just below the bridge, so that the tension from the strings was more evenly distributed across the top. The pitch of the strings could then be higher, and strings under greater tension are also louder. The more robust instrument was strung with four courses of metal strings and tuned to the same pitches as a violin (GDAE). Musicians used a plectrum to play the Neapolitan mandolin. The instrument became enormously popular and was a vital part of the musical genre canzone napoletana (Neapolitan song) that developed in the nineteenth century. Perhaps the most extraordinarily decorated example of a Vinaccia mandolin ι6. Alessandro Gagliano (Italian, 1640-1730). Violin (front and back). Naples, 1704. Spruce, maple, ebony; L. 23 in.

Joseph Gagliano was the grandson of Alessandro Gagliano, the founder of the Neapolitan school of lutherie. already created an instrument with six double courses, but luthiers and players in southern France and Italy adopted the version with six single strings that remains the standard today. Members of both the Gagliano and Vinaccia families built six-string guitars in the eighteenth century, but it was the Fabricatore family who became the most important guitar makers in Naples. Fabricatore guitars tend to be much plainer than earlier instruments and have a figure-eight shaped body with a pronounced waist and a paddle-shaped peghead. On a particularly beautiful instru ment made by Gennaro Fabricatore in 1819 (fig. 19) a strip of mother-of pearl over tortoiseshell outlines the entire top, fingerboard, peghead, and sound hole, and the neck and back are decorated with multiple thin strips of ivory and ebony. Guitars like this were played by the great Italian virtuosos of the nineteenth century, among them Mauro Giuliani and Luigi Legnani. The postecjcjiatori, or street musicians, who played throughout Naples paired them with mandolins. One of the earliest six-string gui tars, probably made in Naples about 1800, is in the Metropolitan (fig. 20). It has an unusual shape and decora tion reminiscent of earlier Baroque 18.

The two instruments are decorated in reverse inlay, for which motifs are cut from multiple sheets of material stacked together, producing perfectly matched pieces. The tech nique allows for two sets of decorative inlays that are mirror images of each other to be created at the same time, reducing somewhat the high cost of these lavishly decorated guitars.

Bini is listed as a guitar maker in the Brooklyn City Directory of 1859. After he became a naturalized citizen in 1866 he moved to Mount Vernon, just north of New York City, where he continued to build guitars with his son Antonio until his death in 1877. In 1870 Bini introduced a pat ent for an unusual and complicated bracing design for the underside of a guitar top. The Museum has an example with Bini's bracing, built by the J. Howard Foote company of New York (fig. 24). After the Kingdom ofTwo Sicilies joined the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 as part of the long process of Italian unification, a prolonged period of economic upheaval on the peninsula forced many poor Italians, primar ily from rural areas, to leave the country to find work. Between 1876 and 1915 millions of Italians moved to major urban areas in North and South America, forming "Little Italy" communities where they were able to retain much of their traditional culture. The New York area became home to the largest population of Italians in the United States, most of them from southern Italy. The immi grants brought with them their love for their traditional music and their instruments. In the 1880S a sudden craze for the Neapolitan mandolin swept across the United States, spurring sales of the instrument to both professional and amateur musicians. Ironically, this sudden interest was sparked by a musical troupe called the Spanish Students that toured the country in 1880. The group had achieved international attention at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1878 and subsequently toured Europe before coming to the United States. Dressed in traditional attire, the Spanish Stu dents performed Spanish folk songs and played the bandurria, a teardrop shaped plucked stringed instrument with a flat back and twelve strings that was often incorrectly identified as a mandolin in the press. (An article in the Neu; York Times of January 2, 1880, for example, noted the arrival of the troupe and its director, Ignacio Martin, in Boston and said that they 24.

The group was immensely popular, and almost imme diately a number of similar acts tried to capitalize on their success. Most of these groups were formed by Italian immigrants who played their Neapoli tan mandolins (see fig. 25), although they often performed under names similar to that of the original "Spanish Students." One of the earliest musicians to take advantage of this phenomenon was Domenico Tipaldi, who as early as 1883 was performing concerts on the mandolin throughout the New York area. Writing in The Theatre in 1886, Clara Lanza noted that everybody surely remembers the Spanish Students, as they were called, ivho came here several years ago and trilled their aesthetic mandolins in our concert-halls. Before their arrival, no such thing as a mandolin existed in America. Since then, however, the graceful little instrument has crept gradually into jàvor, until jinally it has become the/ashionable craze of the hour. Not to know the mandolin is to argue oneself unknown. . . . Silvery strains are heard issuingfiom the Fifth Avenue man sion and the Newport villa. . .. The Span ish Students, as has been said, introduced the mandolin to us, but it has been owing to the efforts of their enterprising conductor, Signor Tipaldi [sic], that it has reached its present status and become an institution in society. . . . The maestro is α Neapolitan, and handles the mandolin as, alas! only a Neapolitan can. Tipaldi was in great demand as a soloist and as the leader of chamber groups and mandolin orchestras like the Orchestra dei Mandolinisti Tipaldi, which played in a concert for Colum bus Day in 1890 that was advertised in Il Progresso, an Italian-language New York newspaper. Among the members of the group were Tipaldi's brothers Francesco and Vincenzo. The Tipaldi brothers gained renown as a mando lin ensemble and also imported and sold mandolins from Italy, among them one made by Giuseppe Vinaccia in Naples in 1896 (fig. 26). Mandolins of all sizes (mandolins, mandolas, and mandocellos, based on the violin family) were played by amateurs as well, in orchestras that were established on college cam puses, in small towns, in factories, and in fraternal and professional organizations at all levels of society. These groups were probably more important for social gatherings than for the music performed, but they stimulated an enormous demand for mandolins. The first Italian mandolin makers that can be documented in New York arrived in the mid-i88os. Angelo Mannello, from Morcone, northeast of Naples, set up his work shop soon after he arrived in 1885. By 1893 he was established and suc cessful enough to show instruments at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where he won a bronze medal for his decorated mandolins and mandolas. Among the American exhibitors Mannello and several lead ing musical instrument manufactur ers and distributors, including Lyon &amp; Healy, William Tonk, and J. How ard Foote, showed mandolins. The contingent from Italy included three mandolin makers: Camillio Di Leo of Palermo and, from Naples, Nicola R. Calaca and the Vinaccia brothers, descendants of the family that stan dardized the Neapolitan mandolin (see figs. 18, 26). Mannello is best known for his dec orated mandolins, which he regularly 26.

Among his masterpieces are two mandolins that were donated by the Mannello family to the Museum in 1972 (figs. 27-31). The more highly decorated of the two was even used in a publicity photograph that appeared in a 1904 article in the Music Trade Reirieu; about the Saint Louis World's Fair (fig. 29). The mandolin has a bowl completely covered with ivory and tortoiseshell inlays, the highlight of which is a female nude suspended in vines that creep up the center of the back (fig. 28). On the metal plate on the back of the peghead is a lyre, the instrument of Orpheus, intertwined with a modern parlor guitar (fig. 31), doubtless reflecting Mannello's efforts to equate his instruments with celebrated instruments of the past and to place them in the long continuum of fine stringed instrument making. Luthiers had long evoked Orpheus in their work (see fig. 22), and the very form of the ancient lyre inspired many nineteenth- and twentieth-century craftsmen, among them Gennaro Fabricatore, Nicola Turturro, and Luigi Mozzani (see figs. 32, 33). The vast majority of instruments produced by Mannello and his work shop were made for musical instru ment distributors such as C. Bruno &amp;. Son of New York, who sold Mannello's mandolins under their own name. Several of the Bruno company ledger books survive in the archives of the Museum. The 1895 ledger, the first in which Mannello appears, records that in that year he sold Bruno $4,349.94 worth of mandolins (the number of instruments is not noted). In the next surviving ledger, from 1897, the figure has risen to $7,082.57. Bruno was selling these mandolins in its catalogue for prices ranging from $7.00 to $150.00. The 1895 catalogue offered twenty-seven models, most of which were fairly inexpensive.

The January 30,1904, issue of Music Trade Review reported that Mannello was said to be expanding his international sales and that in the previous year (1903), sales "showed an increase of about 7,000 instruments" over 1902. The scale of production would imply a large workforce, and indeed the article noted that "at present Mr. Man nello employs 75 hands in his plant." Another Italian mandolin maker, Neapolitan Luigi Ricca, came to New York in 1886 to teach guitar and mandolin at the German Conserva tory of Music. Ricca appeared as part ofTipaldi's mandolin orchestra for the Columbus Day concert in 1890, around the time he began to manu facture mandolins and guitars. Early in the 1890s he published a catalogue featuring thirteen models in which he claimed that he had made more "fine goods than any firm in my line in the country." Ricca's workshop grew quickly, and he relocated several times to ever larger facilities. In 1898 he began building pianos on a large scale, and to what extent he contin ued the mandolin business after that is unclear. Ricca's greatest influence was on the many luthiers who worked for him and then established their own shops, including Charles Biggio, Antonio Grauso, and A. Russo. Large American musical instru ment manufacturers also produced massive numbers of mandolins and employed Italian luthiers to do so. Oscar Schmidt, the largest manufac turer of stringed instruments in the country, produced more than 75,000 of one type of mandolin in the decade preceding 1904, according to a Music Trades article that appeared on Sep tember 24 of that year. Among the Italian luthiers employed in Schmidt's factory in Jersey City was Antonio Carlucci, who by 1912 was a leading member of the company. (Before coming to Schmidt, Carlucci had run his own workshop at 188 Hous ton Street, which is listed in the City MANNELLO AT WORLD'S FAIR.

Conn ofElkhart, Indiana, the leading U.S. manufacturer of band instruments, hired John Dejulio, a former fore man of the Ricca workshop, to head a department building mandolins. They also brought in New York violin maker William Pezzone to establish a violin-making operation. The man dolin's mass-market appeal swelled when mail-order companies such as Montgomery Ward and Sears &amp; Roe buck began selling the instrument at remarkably low prices. Sears offered a mandolin in 1905 for $1.95. The Lyon &amp; Healy Company of Chicago also built and sold Neapolitan-style mandolins under the model name Washburn. The Museum has a decorative model with a mother-of-pearl fingerboard and its original tooled leather case (fig. 34). City directories, newspaper articles and advertisements, census records, patent applications, and labels from surviving instruments document scores of Italian luthiers working in New York in the early decades of the twentieth century. Some, like Man nello and Ricca, operated large work shops, but most, like Nicola Turturro (see fig. 32), employed only a handful of workers. Turturro was an innovator who made products such as the beau tiful mandolira, which combined the lyre shape often used for guitars with a bowlback mandolin, and the "pea nut" ukulele, so named for the shape of its waisted body. The combination of large manufacturers and small workshops no doubt accounted for what must have been many hundreds of workers producing stringed instru 20 32 (above left).

It was this incredibly vibrant lutherie culture that John D'Angelico became a part of in the 1910s, when he was still a boy. D'Angelico was born in 1905 to immigrants Maria and Phillip D'Angelico, a tailor who lived on Mott Street in lower Manhattan. At the age of nine he began working with his uncle, the luthier Raphael Ciani, in his workshop at 57 Kenmare Street, and when Ciani died in 1923 the eighteen year-old D'Angelico was left in charge of the workshop and its employees. The shop continued to build instru ments with the Ciani label, including a guitar attributed to D'Angelico that is dated to about the time of Ciani's death (fig. 35). The only known bowl back mandolin bearing a label with John D'Angelico's name (fig. 36) rep resents the traditional training he received in the Ciani shop. In the 1920s the popularity of the mandolin greatly diminished as the tenor banjo became the plucked instrument of choice for amateur musicians. The tenor banjo has four strings tuned the same as a mando lin's, which made it easy for players to switch instruments. Suddenly the Italian luthiers had little market for their Neapolitan-style mando lins. This reality caused the young D'Angelico to look for other ways to make a living as a luthier. After the death of his uncle, he may have studied violin making with Mario Frosali, who lived on West 51st Street at the time. It was probably also in the 1920s that D'Angelico began to experiment with making archtop guitars, although none of his instru ments from those years survive. The archtop guitar was invented in the 1890s by Orville Gibson of Kala mazoo, Michigan. Gibson expounded his construction philosophy in his 1895 patent application (granted U.S. Patent Number 598.245 on February 1, 34. Lyon &amp; Healy, maker. Mando lin, Washburn brand, style 275.

Violins had for centuries been con structed with a carved convex back and top. Gibson produced not just guitars but also mandolins in this way, creating a new American form of the instrument.

The company hired sound engi neer and master luthier Lloyd Loar in 1919. Loar worked for Gibson until 1924, introducing the Master Model instruments that included the iconic F-5 mandolin and L-5 guitar (fig. 37). Loar's redesign of Gibson's archtop guitar incorporated other elements from the violin, including a floating bridge held on only by the tension of the strings, a tailpiece where the strings terminate (flat top guitars have a fixed bridge glued to the top, where the strings terminate), and violin-style f-holes instead of a round sound hole. The L-5 produced a bigger sound, which jazz players of the 1920s used to create a punchy rhythmic accompani ment that cut through the big band instrumentation popular at the time. Jazz guitarists like Charlie Christian and Eddie Lang made the instrument a mainstay of the jazz tradition. The archtop guitar must have attracted D'Angelico for several rea sons. First, the instrument required a great deal of highly skilled labor to build, and it therefore sold at higher prices than comparable flat top gui tars. The 1928 Gibson catalogue listed 37. Gibson.

(In the mid-ig30s, by which time prices had fallen, D'Angelico was selling his Excel model for the same price, $175, as Gibson's L-5.) Second, D'Angelico's great skill and training as a crafts man meant that he was able to dis tinguish himself and his products as superior to factory-made instru ments and those of other luthiers. And third, his location in New York allowed him access to many of the great jazz guitarists of the time. As his fame spread, guitarists of all genres would make a point of stop ping by his shop whenever they played in the city (see fig. 38). The earliest surviving archtop guitar by D'Angelico is serial number 1002 (figs. 39, 40), which is essen tially a copy of the Gibson L-5 of the period (see fig. 37). It was made in 1932, the year D'Angelico opened his own workshop at 40 Kenmare Street (one block from the Ciani shop). The 1002 is nearly identical to an L-5 gui tar, from the outline of the body and headstock to the dark sunburst finish. Early D'Angelico guitars lack the pat ented truss rod that runs the length of the neck on Gibson guitars of the same period, allowing adjustments to the curvature, but after the patent 38. John D'Angelico in his workshop at 40 Kenmare Street, New York, 1942 expired D'Angelico included this feature as well. D'Angelico's instru ments quickly gained a reputation among players for having a balanced, full tone throughout their range and a smoother sound than most other guitars. As he gained success as a guitar maker he began to move away from building L-5 copies and to shape his own style. Although each of his guitars was a singular creation, in the mid-i930s he introduced model designations, initially Style A, Style B, and Excel, which were fairly similar to each other except that each successive model had more ornamentation than the previous one. The Excel model was especially popular among play ers. Its bright sound was particularly well suited to rhythm guitar playing. 39. John D'Angelico. Archtop guitar (serial number 1002).

D'Angelico began build ing cutaways in the late 1940s, again copying earlier Gibson models. D'Angelico introduced what would become his top model, the New Yorker, in the late 1930s. The New Yorker was a larger-bodied instrument, at eigh teen inches a full inch wider than the earlier models (see fig. 43). Its deco rative features echo the then fashion able Art Deco architecture, specifically the New Yorker Hotel, the profile of which is inlaid in mother-of-pearl on the headstock (figs. 44, 45). The classic New Yorkers feature cutaway bodies, Art Deco-inspired geometric inlays on the fingerboard, gold-plated metal tuners and tailpiece, and multiple lay ers of plastic binding (usually in alter nating black and white layers) around the body, fingerboard, and peghead. D'Angelico's customers included well-known jazz and swing guitarists Al Valenti (the first artist to endorse his guitars), Johnny Smith, Tony Mot tola (guitarist for Perry Como and Frank Sinatra), Irving Ashby (a guitar ist in Nat King Cole's trio), and Bucky Pizzarelli. Guitarists known for other genres of music were also attracted to the instruments: two early owners were Les Paul and Chet Atkins (see fig. 46), who both used D'Angelico guitars before they became famous for playing electric guitars. Many later-generation guitarists like Pete Townshend, George Benson, Eric Clapton, John Fogerty, and John Mayer have also owned or used D'Angelico archtops (see figs. 47, 48).

For years DiSerio executed nearly all the rough work on almost every instrument built in the shop. James D'Aquisto joined the workshop in the early 1950s and would remain until D'Angelico's death in 1964. After earning a certain reputation, D Angelico was pressured to expand 44 (far left).

The musical instrument manufac turer Fred Gretsch asked him to work for his company, but he turned him down. DiSerio disagreed with DAngelico's decision, and the con flict between the two men caused DiSerio to leave the shop in 1959. This blow was followed later that year by the condemnation of the building at 40 Kenmare Street, which was not only DAngelico's workplace but also his home. He closed the shop and moved in with his brother-in-law and nephew at 166 Mulberry Street, where he would live for the rest of his life. These trials nearly convinced DAngelico to abandon guitar build ing, but the ambitious DAquisto encouraged him to open in a new location and continue the business. James DAquisto was born in Brooklyn on November 9,1935, to a family of Italian Americans with roots in Palermo. His father was a tool and die maker and his grand father a custom tailor. DAquisto was surrounded by the traditional music played on the violin, mandolin, and guitar (which his father played). Jimmy, as he was known throughout his life, took formal lessons from the guitarist Anthony Antone and became a proficient player. He was enamored of jazz music and went to the clubs in Manhattan to hear the modern sound of guitarists like Tal Farlow and Jim Hall. His interest in guitars led DAquisto to the work shop of John DAngelico. In his book Acquired of the Angels, Paul Schmidt records DAquisto's first reaction to a DAngelico guitar: "So I sat down 44 (far left). Headstock of fig. 43.

I'd never heard anything like that or ever thought a guitar was supposed to sound like that!" D'Aquisto began to visit D'Angel ico's shop on a regular basis, and when he was just seventeen, in about 1953, D'Angelico offered him a job. Initially he was little more than an errand and shop boy, but he was eager to learn and his incessant questions began to elicit information from D'Angelico and, even more so, from DiSerio, who saw in the energetic boy a chance to pawn off some of his work. After D'Angelico's shop was condemned, D'Aquisto spent several months pestering the older man to reopen and eventually convinced him to buy a new shop at 37 Kenmare Street. The workshop opened in early i960, and for the next four years the two men worked side by side as D'Angelico taught every detail of guitar building to D'Aquisto (see inside back cover). When D'Angelico suffered the first of a series of heart attacks in i960, the young D'Aquisto began to take over more and more of the guitar building, until eventually he was doing most of the work. lohn D'Angelico died of a heart attack on September 1,1964, at the age of fifty-nine. He had never mar ried, and after his death the members of his extended family had little use for, or interest in, the guitar making business. They recognized that Jimmy D'Aquisto was practically a son to the master and the heir to his life's work. The family offered D'Aquisto the opportunity to buy the workshop, including the tools and the right to use the D'Angelico name, for $3,000. Although the price was reasonable, D'Aquisto was married with three small children and unable to raise such a sum. He approached a wealthy lawyer who had been a customer of D'Angelico's to secure a loan, and soon the shop at 37 Kenmare Street was operating again. Although D'Aquisto had worked in the D'Angelico shop for years and by the end of D'Angelico's life was doing nearly all the work on the guitars, he had no reputation of his own as a luth ier. With the older man gone, there were no orders for new guitars, and D'Aquisto turned to repairing instru ments. Only after nearly a year on his 46 (top).

George Benson with his D'Angelico New Yorker model guitar, ca. 2008 own did he build his first instrument. As he remembered in the 1986 docu mentary The Neu; Yorker Special: So, I just said to myself, look you know you can build the damn thing. I don't want to do repairs Jor the rest of my life. I want to build a guitar. I can make a guitar. . . . TheJirst ten guitars I made, they u;ere just DAngelicos and all I did was put D'Aquisto's [name] in the headpiece. And somebody would see the guitar and say, "Hey, what'd you get a new DAngelico?" It was very, uery satisfying. It turned out just the way I wanted it to turn out. When players came to D'Aquisto's shop to have their guitars repaired, they would see and often play his instruments, and as word gradually spread orders began to trickle in. One of them was for a New Yorker Special in 1967 (fig. 49). With a seventeen inch body and all the decorative appointments of the New Yorker, this D'Aquisto model was quite similar to earlier D'Angelico guitars, but there were already some stylistic differences. The f-holes are shaped differently, for example, and New Yorker is written on a scroll on the headstock rather than on a stylized version of the New Yorker Hotel. Another of D'Aquisto's early instruments is an archtop mandolin with a two-point outline of his own design (fig. 50). Built in 1971, this was the first of the three mandolins he made during his career. Unfortunately, the contract D'Aquisto had signed to secure a loan to buy the shop made his creditor the owner of the business—including the guitar building business—while he worked for a meager salary. Unable to earn enough to have any hope of ever repay ing the loan and owning the business himself, the young luthier began to realize that he had been taken by the savvy lawyer. As tensions rose, confrontations between the two men became a regular occurrence. A dis- . agreement about the ownership of the guitars D'Aquisto was building led him to ask for an end to the relation ship. But in his anger he rashly agreed to yet another bad deal, and he lost much of the shop equipment and the rights to the D'Angelico name. Then, on Christmas Day in 1965, the work shop was robbed of all the instru ments inside it, both the guitars D'Aquisto was repairing and the ones he was building. He was forced to leave the shop and Manhattan, but his family helped him secure a loan to buy new equipment and build a shop in Huntington, Long Island, where he began to build instruments in 1966. He later moved to Farmingdale and finally settled permanently in Green port (see figs. 51-52). In the year that D'Angelico died, 1964, the Beatles played on the Ed Sullivan Show. Rock and roll and the electric guitar were the dominant musical forces of the time. The jazz scene was centered in the clubs of major metropolitan areas, where small combos explored the bebop and cool jazz styles of the time. The arch top guitar, with its many subtleties of sound, smooth and balanced tone throughout its range, and high-quality craftsmanship, continued to be the instrument of choice, especially when it was amplified through a speaker. Since the 1940s, D'Angelico had been building guitars with pickups to allow for amplification, and D'Aquisto built some solid body electric guitars during his career (see fig. 55). Like D'Angelico before him, D'Aquisto was sought out by the very best play ers working in the city, including the legendary Jim Hall. D'Aquisto's great skill and reputation allowed him to dominate this small niche market even when the demand for acoustic guitars was at its lowest. As his fame grew, he counted among his custom ers guitarists from a wide spectrum of the musical world, including Grant Green, Paul Simon, and Steve Miller 48.

Grant Green with his 1972 D'Aquisto New Yorker Deluxe model archtop guitar (serial number 1055), from the 1976 album The Main Attraction (see figs. 53-55). The orange archtop guitar he built for Paul Simon in 1975 (fig. 54) has Simon's name inlaid on the headstock. D'Aquisto sug gested the unusual center sound hole because Simon usually played a flat top guitar, and he wanted a sweeter sound more appropriate to his music. D'Aquisto felt confined by the legacy of D'Angelico and wanted to experiment with his own ideas. Early on he began altering the shape of the f-holes and the design of the headpiece and varying the colors of the varnish. He grew to prefer new materials, using European woods, for example, instead of the domestic varieties D'Angelico had favored. Because he had seen many of the plastics D'Angelico had used in the 1950s disintegrate, D'Aquisto began making bindings, tailpieces, and pickguards from wood. Throughout his career he experimented with the traditional aesthetic designs of the guitar, and he did so in order to realize his own acoustical ideas. Musicians and audiences had a certain expecta tion of what an archtop should look like, and that look was defined by the classic Art Deco instruments. But D'Aquisto wanted to build much simpler designs with less ornamenta tion, believing that the extra decora tive flourishes, inlays, and bindings subtracted from the resonance of the guitar. In the 1980s he incorporated his ideas into what he called the "clas sic" model, and he continued to push the design of the guitar in ever more radical directions. In the late 1980s and early 1990s he introduced what is now often called his modern series, which included the guitar models known as the Avant Garde, the Solo, the Centura, and the Advance (of which only one example was built; see fig. 56). These new D'Aquisto mod els remained characteristically free of ornamentation, but their design, with irregularly shaped sound holes, angular tailpieces and pickguards, futuristic headstocks with cutouts, and stark colors, was incredibly mod ern for archtop guitars. D'Aquisto made some twenty-five modern series instruments. Along with a handful of electric guitars incorporating the 51-52· James D'Aquisto in his shop in Greenport, New York, late 1970s 53· Grant Green with his 1972 D'Aquisto New Yorker Deluxe model archtop guitar (serial number 1055), from the 1976 album The Main Attraction</page><page sequence="29">54· James D'Aquisto.

This special oval hole archtop guitarwas built for Paul Simon and bears his name on the headstock. same aesthetic, they have become arguably the most famous guitars of his entire output. Through them he dramatically changed the world of guitar making. In April 1995 D'Aquisto was in California consulting with the Fender Guitar Company when he suffered an epileptic seizure—a disease from which he had suffered all his adult life^—and died. He was fifty-nine years old, the same age at which John DAngelico had died more than three decades earlier. Although DAquisto had trained no apprentice in the way that he had learned from DAngelico, he had had an immense influence on a whole generation of younger luthiers, freeing them from traditional constraints, sharing his concepts of sound production, and linking the contemporary craft with the skilled craftsmanship of the luthiers of DAngelico's generation. The typical musician is rather conservative when purchasing instru ments and generally prefers to buy an established brand name or a type he or she is familiar with. Even a mas ter craftsman like James DAquisto, respected as the leading builder of his generation, felt compelled to make instruments that would match musicians' preconceptions of how an archtop guitar should look. Then, in the late 1980s, as the acoustic guitar market began to recover from its long slump, a new generation of guitar collectors came onto the scene. Prior to that time, collectors of vintage (usually American-made) stringed instruments had tended to collect old instruments such as pre war flat top Martin guitars, 1920s and 1930s Gibson mandolins and guitars, and iconic 1950s Fender electrics. In the eighties, led by the young Scott Chinery, who had amassed more than a thousand instruments, col lectors began to commission new instruments. Chinery had recognized 55. Steve Miller with his 1994 D'Aquisto chambered body Electric Centura model guitar(serial number494 A) that there was a whole class of fine luthiers working at the time who were building instruments that, like fine violins, were singular works of art, and not mass-produced objects. These collectors wanted pieces that were artistic examples of visual beauty, but they also wanted instru ments that were custom-made to suit their own idiosyncratic playing techniques and physical structures. Chinery and those who followed him gave luthiers the opportunity to experiment without worrying about having to build a product that would sell in a guitar shop. It was this free dom that enabled D'Aquisto to break from his past and develop his modern series guitars. Scott Chinery, who lived in Toms River, New Jersey, was one of the collectors who began working with D'Aquisto to create singular guitars 54· James D'Aquisto.

D'Aquisto built several instruments for Chinery, one of the most famous of which was a Centura Deluxe guitar that the col lector specifically requested in blue (fig. 57). After the instrument was finished, the collector was so thrilled with the result that it inspired him to commission a host of the best archtop makers to build instruments, stipulat ing only that they be lacquered the same blue as the DAquisto guitar and have an eighteen-inch-wide body. Chinery described the project in the catalogue for the collection: I had often thought that it would be neat to get all the great portrait painters together to interpret the same subject and then see the differences among them. So that's what I set out to do with the Blue Guitars. To get all the greatest builders together and haue them interpret the same guitar, an 18-inch arch top, in the same color blue that Jimmy had used. All of these great luthiers saw this as a friendly competition, and as a result they went beyond anything they'd ever done. We ended up with a collection of the greatest archtop guitars ever made. After the death of DAquisto, Chin ery began to see the Blue Collection as a tribute to the late master and his profound effect on the guitar industry. The entire collection was exhibited in 1998 at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Chinery died in 2000, but the master luthiers he helped to establish, and the collectors he inspired to support these mod ern makers, continue to advance the world of lutherie and archtop guitar making, ensuring that the tradition will carry on far into the future. James D'Aquisto's influence on the guitar-making world, and the genera tion of luthiers after him, was pro found. Although the Blue Collection represents the greatest archtop mak ers from all over the country, several of the most important contributions were from Italian American makers who came from the same New York culture and tradition as DAngelico and DAquisto. One of the great mak ers who came of age after D'Aquisto was Robert Benedetto, who was born in the Bronx in 1946, grew up sur rounded by traditional Italian music making, and learned woodworking skills in his father's shop. Like most of the luthiers of his generation, Benedetto is self-taught and learned from other makers and by examin ing and repairing great instruments. Although he is from the New York Italian American tradition, the great majority of Benedetto's career has been spent in Florida, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. One of his most famous guitars is La Cremona Azzurra, which he built as his contribution to Scott Chinery's Blue Guitar project. The stunning guitar bears unusual foliate sound holes in the upper left and lower right corners. The design was partially in response to an idea that Scott Chinery had pursued by asking luthiers to build instruments that would give him a truer sense of what the gui tar would sound like to the audience. The maker who best represents the continuing tradition of Italian American lutherie in the New York region is John Monteleone (fig. 58). John's father, Mario, had left the fam ily baking business in Brooklyn in order to study art. Mario went to work for his uncle John De Cesare, who created sculpture and bas-reliefs for buildings such as the Barclay-Vesey, the Irving Trust Company, and the Empire State Building. Following World War II Mario moved his family to Islip, on Long Island, and started a company with his brother that made 56. James D'Aquisto. Archtop guitar, Advance model (serial number 1255).

John Monteleone, who was born in Manhat tan in 1947, thus grew up surrounded by a family of craftsmen from whom he learned a wide variety of skills, including how to read blueprints, how to make casting templates, and how to work with many different materials. John was also a talented musician; he was classically trained as a pianist and also played the upright bass, tuba, euphonium, and guitar. By the time he graduated from Tarkio College in Missouri with a degree in music education in 1970, Monteleone had developed a love for musical instruments. He began repairing instruments for his friends, and he even tried his hand at build ing one. Yet although he knew of the guitars of John D'Angelico and had heard about his famous apprentice, James D'Aquisto, Monteleone did not think he could make a living as a luthier. After college, he started working for his father, but after an extended backpacking trip through Europe he decided he wanted to make stringed instruments. Not long after he set up his own workshop in Islip, he heard on the radio about the new Mandolin Brothers vintage musical instrument store on Staten Island. When he showed them some of his instruments, the dealers immediately recognized his skill and hired him to do their repair work. This gave him access to the great vintage instru ments that entered their store. One of the problems Monteleone saw on the guitars he repaired in the 1970s and 1980s was the degradation of plastic parts that dated from the 1930s to the 1950s, when the materi als were still relatively new. Among the materials susceptible to degrada tion was the particular type of plastic used in the bindings on a number of beautiful DAngelico guitars, espe cially those from the early 1950s. When Monteleone learned that D Aquisto had his workshop in Long Island, he contacted him to ask about the con struction ofDAngelico's instruments and the materials used to make them. The two men began a regular corres pondence, and Monteleone often drove to DAquisto's workshop to observe the man's work and discuss ideas about building instruments. D'Aquisto, who had established himself as the preeminent guitar maker, began to send repair work to Monteleone and helped establish him as a trusted repairman for D'Angelico instruments. Monteleone especially appreciated D'Aquisto's approach to solving some of the challenges inherent in build ing an acoustic guitar and wanted to understand his ideas about sound production and the geometry of the guitar and its hardware. As a young luthier in the 1970s Monteleone was also confronted with a deteriorat ing market for acoustic guitars. Unlike D'Aquisto, who was an established maker and had inher ited the D'Angelico workshop and clientele, Monteleone had to make his own path. One of his interests was the folk music revival. Since returning to the city from college he had been playing bass in several of the folk groups that performed in the clubs of Greenwich Vil lage. Although most of these guitarists used flat top guitars like the Martin D-28 model, Monteleone realized that there was an untapped market for high-quality luthier-made mandolins. The folk players used F-5 model mandolins, which have a carved top and back (without a bowl) like the archtop guitar. The F-5 model mandolin had been developed by Lloyd Loar and introduced in the 1920s as a counterpart to the L-5 57. James D'Aquisto. Archtop guitar, Blue Centura Deluxe model (serial numberi252).

John Monteleone sanding a Grand Artist model guitar in his workshop in Islip, New York, 2008 archtop guitar. In the beginning the F-5 model was not a success, largely because the popularity of the mando lin was already waning. After World War II, however, the F-5 was picked up by bluegrass musicians like Bill Monroe and became a favored instru ment in the folk music world. Mon teleone began building copies of the F-5 model, which he sold through the Mandolin Brothers store. But he soon developed his own ideas for improving the Loar design, which had remained virtually unchanged for fifty years. In 1977 Monteleone introduced the Grand Artist mandolin (fig. 5g), which incorporated many of his innovations. To start, Monteleone had redrawn the outline of the mandolin, although as an homage to the F-5 he kept the point on the lower right side and the scroll on the upper left, which he enlarged and hollowed out to give the instrument an increased sound chamber for greater resonance. He redesigned the tailpiece and included a built-in string damper (to eliminate rattles and unwanted overtones), a one-piece bridge and an abbreviated pickguard, and, eventually, a radial fingerboard that better fit the players' hands. The resulting mandolin was a departure for players who had been using essentially the same model for half a century. It was enormously well received and began to be used by many of the most important mandolin players, including David Grisman. Monteleone developed his reputation as an outstanding luthier and secured commissions from the very best players and collectors, for mandolins as well as for the other members of the mandolin family, the mandola and the mandocello. In 1979 Monteleone contacted another of the deans of New York lutherie, Mario Maccaferri of the Bronx. Maccaferri was born in 1900 in the town of Cento, near Bologna in northern Italy. At the age of eleven he began working as an apprentice in the workshop of Luigi Mozzani, a virtuoso player and respected luthier (see fig. 33). Mozzani encouraged Maccaferri to build and also to play guitars. After studying at the conser vatory of Siena, Maccaferri toured Europe as a soloist, eventually settling in London. In the early 1930s jazz was a big hit in Europe, and the instru ment manufacturer Henri Selmer asked Maccaferri to design a guitar that could be used in jazz music. Maccaferri designed an instrument that Selmer began producing in 1933 (fig. 60). Maccaferri's design gained wide fame when Django Reinhardt chose it as his primary guitar. Maccaferri, a great entrepreneur, began to make reeds for clarinets and saxophones in Paris. In order to expand the business and escape the war in Europe, he moved to New York in 1939. At the World's Fair that year Maccaferri grew intrigued with plastic and began to experiment with manufacturing plastic instead of cane reeds. He received a patent in 1941 and developed a market for the product when the supply of cane reed from southern France was cut off during the war. His enterprise grew to one of the major plastic manu facturing companies in the United States. Maccaferri produced all manner of products but always kept his hand in the musical instrument world, introducing mass-produced plastic ukuleles and guitars in the 1950s and 1960s and later experi 58.

Maccaferri was winding down his plastics business when he met Monteleone in 1979. They immedi ately became friends and had long discussions about musical instrument making. Maccaferri had Monteleone build a guitar based on an old draw ing, and the two men worked together to refine Maccaferri's design. After constructing the initial guitar they embarked on a project to build twelve guitars together—six classical and six archtop—over the next few years. The work greatly excited Maccaferri, who wanted to start a guitar building busi ness with Monteleone and offered the 59. John Monteleone (American, born 1947).

Monteleone recalls Maccaferri saying, "What do you want to do, do you want to make art or do you want to make money?" Like D'Angelico, Montele one decided he liked the freedom of working for himself, but he and Mac caferri remained friends and shared ideas until Maccaferri died in 1993 at the age of ninety-two. Although the early 1980s were a difficult time for guitar makers, Monteleone flourished as he built a reputation as one of the great man dolin makers. He continued to refine his skills, influenced by both James DAquisto and Mario Maccaferri. When toward the end of the 1980s the market for guitars, including high-end arch tops, experienced a great resurgence, Monteleone was well prepared to meet the demands of a new generation of players and collectors. Over the past twenty years he has continued to build the very finest of archtop guitars and mandolins. Like many modern build ers he has benefited from DAquisto's groundbreaking designs, but he has also experimented with the aesthetic design of the guitar. One of his signa ture designs is his Grand Artist scroll guitar (fig. 61, and see front and back covers), with a large scroll that is an homage to his mandolin-making roots. Like the luthiers of DAngelico's generation Monteleone has included Art Deco elements on his guitars, drawing inspiration from such land marks as Radio City Music Hall and the Chrysler Building.

Monteleone has an extraordinary ability to combine a creative visual aesthetic with an astoundingly full and balanced sound to produce a masterpiece with each new instru ment. In 2002 he undertook his most ambitious project to date: an ensemble of four guitars that were to be kept and played together as a set. He called the guitars the Four Seasons (figs. 63, 64). Winter, the first of the set to be completed, is a white instrument with ebony hardware and mother-of pearl and diamond inlays. Spring is a light blue sunburst with floral inlays. The fiery red Summer is constructed as a scroll guitar. Autumn is a more autumnal orange, and its sound holes have raggedy edges inspired by the shapes of leaves. Monteleone com missioned jazz guitarist Anthony Wilson (fig. 65) to write a piece spe cifically for the ensemble, which was recorded in 2010.

And like many luthiers before him, Monteleone has had influential relationships with great musicians.

After Scott Chinery was finally able to add the instrument to his massive collection, he asked James D'Aquisto to do his own take on the famous form. Although reluctant at first, D Aquisto finally built a version based on his Solo model guitar (fig. 68). DAquisto's Teardrop became as famous as DAngelico's, and the two were recorded together by Steve Howe and Martin Taylor on their album Masterpiece Guitars, which fea tured instruments from the Chinery collection. To finish the story, a pri vate collector commissioned John Monteleone to build his own Tear drop, which he completed in 2008 (fig. 69). In an even more radical departure from the original model, Monteleone built his Teardrop with his signature scroll. Although undis putedly related by their unusual form, the three instruments are each the result of a commission for a unique guitar, and they are a clear demon stration of the different design aesthetics of the three remarkable craftsmen who made them. 68.

Joseph Drexel, a banker and philanthropist who served as the president of the Philharmonic Soci ety, lent the Museum his collection of forty-four instruments in the mid 1880S, and in February 1889, after his death, his wife, Lucy, donated them to the Metropolitan. Later that same year Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown gave 270 instruments to the Museum. Over the next thirty years, until she died in 1918, Mrs. Brown would acquire more than 3,600 instruments for the Museum. The Crosby Brown Collection, named for Mrs. Brown's husband, comprised instruments from "all nations," and about sixty percent of the assemblage consisted of examples from outside Europe and the United States. The Western instruments were representative of both folk and art music traditions and included an especially important group of keyboard instruments. Yet, remarkably, considering the fame and importance of the great Italian luthiers, neither the Brown collec tion nor the earlier Drexel collection included a single notable stringed instrument from Italy. Mrs. Brown addressed her philosophy in the cata logue published by the Metropolitan Museum in 1902. Though the collec tion contained many examples of rare artistic merit, she explained, no instrument has been chosen for its beauty alone, nor has historical association been a determining consideration. In each case the specimen has won its right to a place because illustrating some step in the devel opment of music. No special effort has been 70. Antonio Stradivari (Italian, 1644-1737).

Thus, it is greatly to be hoped that the collection may ultimately contain examples 0/the work manship o/the great Italian iriolin makers. But, in general, a Stradivarius or an Amati is too precious to be condemned to a monas tic existence. Unlike many old keyboards and winds, old stringed instruments, especially violins, remain playable, and they have become more desir able than new instruments. Old instruments are regarded as better than new ones because of the way that changes in the wood over time affect their tone. The construction, with an arched top and back, is also very stable, allowing instruments to stay in use for a very long time, and the design of the instrument has changed relatively little since the sixteenth century, allowing modern violinists to use older instruments that have been modified to current configuration. Perhaps even more so today than a hundred years ago, it is expected that a good violinist will use an old violin. At the time Mrs. Brown was collecting, fine old violins were extraordinarily rare in the United States, yet the few that were here were highly regarded for their use in performances. The first Italian violins to come to the United States arrived with Euro pean virtuosos who toured the coun try in the nineteenth century. One of the first and most important of those violinists was the Norwegian Ole Bull, who was rapturously received by American audiences in 1843-45. When the press covered Bull's con certs and appearances, they often also wrote about his collection of fine 70. Antonio Stradivari (Italian, 1644-1737). Violoncello, "Batta Piatigorsky."

Among the violins in his collection he counted several that were as well known for their visual appeal as for their sound. He owned a violin made in Brescia by Gaspar da Salo that in place of a scroll has a polychrome head traditionally attrib uted to the sculptor Benvenuto Cel lini. His violin by Antonio Stradivari was of similar merit, being one of the set of ornamented violins Stradivari made in about 1694 as a gift to the king of Spain upon his anticipated progress through Cremona. Bull's collection also included a violin by Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesù, whose instruments are noted for their rugged appearance. The first violin masterwork to be owned by an American was probably the "King Joseph" by Guarneri del Gesù, which was among the most celebrated of violins in Europe. John P. Waters of Brooklyn purchased the instrument in 1868 from the London dealer Hart &amp; Sons, and Royal de Forest Hawley of Hartford, the first great American collector of violins, owned it from 1876 until his death in 1893. (Since 2002 the "King Joseph" has been owned by a well-known American collector.) The dearth of great Italian stringed instruments in the United States at the end of the nineteenth century is illustrated by the small size of "The Violin Collection" included in the loan exhibition hosted by the National Academy of Design in 1883 to raise money to build the ped estal for the Statue of Liberty. Accord ing to the Neu; York Times review of December 26, only nine instruments, all on loan from private collections (Ole Bull's widow lent three), were on display in a modest case that stood in the middle of the print room among the Dürers, Rembrandts, Rubenses, and Cranachs. "Amateurs regret that there is no Stradivarius in the collec tion," the reviewer continued. "Per haps Mr. Hawley, of Hartford, might still send his instrument, the only 'Strad' that is believed to be found in the United States." By the turn of the twentieth cen tury interest was growing in Italian violins, and wealthy Americans were purchasing them for their art collec tions. A few, like Hawley, even special ized in collecting such instruments. When the instruments from Hawley's collection were eventually sold by the Chicago musical instrument dealers Lyon &amp; Healy in 1903, they were pur chased by such notables as Charles Ringling of Rjngling Brothers; W. H. Winslow, publisher of House Beautiful and Frank Lloyd Wright's first client; and sugar magnate Henry Osborne Havemeyer, benefactor of the Met ropolitan Museum, who purchased the famed "King Joseph" Guarneri violin in 1903. Havemeyer built an important collection of stringed instruments that also included the extraordinary "Batta-Piatigorsky" violoncello that has been on loan to the Metropolitan Museum since 2005 (fig. 70)· In 1906 Ann Bolton Fay Matthews of Boston, an amateur violinist from a wealthy New England family, pur chased a long pattern Stradivari violin (fig. 71) from Patrick A. Collins, former mayor of Boston and a consul-general for the United States in London, where he had purchased the violin for his daughter a decade earlier. In 1910 Mrs. Matthews purchased from a private owner in Geneva a second "Strad," this one made during what is often called Stradivari's "golden period," the years 1700-1720 (fig. 72). She assigned names to her two vio lins, calling the long pattern violin the "Francesca" after Stradivari's wife Francesca Ferraboschi and the golden period instrument "The Antonius" after the maker himself.

Mrs. Bryant's gift to the Museum is of special note because of the fate of another prominent American col lection of violins a few years earlier. Dwight J. Partello, a career diplomat, had acquired a number of stringed instruments during his stays in Europe (see fig. 73), and he instructed in his will that his collection of twenty-one violins, three violas, and a violoncello be given to the Smithsonian Institut ion in Washington, D.C. When Partello died in 1920 the bequest sparked a public controversy that played out nationwide in the press. The Louisville Evening Post printed an editorial on February 18,1921, entitled "On Impris oning Violins in Museums" that demanded that "the American public should take steps to put an end to such an extravagant waste." The vio linists Fritz Kreisler, Eugène Ysaye, and Leopold Auer wrote letters of complaint to the family and the press. Kreisler summed up their opinions in a letter to the editor of the Louisville paper in February 1921: "It is a great pity that valuable violins should be placed in museums, and consequendy out of reach of the artists who depend upon them for their musical expres sion." The Partello family challenged the will, and in a remarkable turn of events they won the court case, took possession of the instruments, and had them sold by Lyon &amp; Healy in 1922. The Partello collection and the subsequent court case had thus dominated the music world for years when, in the summer of 1924, Annie Bryant first approached the Museum about her violins. Mrs. Bryant was a lifelong resident of Boston and gave pieces from her family's collection to the Museum of Fine Arts there. (The 72. Antonio Stradivari. Violin, "The Antonius." Cremona, 1711.

One reason she decided to bequeath her violins to the Metropolitan instead may have been the high-profile series of public concerts that had been taking place in the Great Hall at the Museum under the direction of David Mannes since World War I. The concerts, presented free on eight successive Sunday eve nings each winter, drew immense crowds of many thousands of people (fig. 74). Mrs. Bryant, who desired that her violins should be played by virtuosos and not just put on display, surely hoped that they would be used in such events. And indeed they were, for on March 23,1935, the Neu; York Times carried a notice for a concert that would feature the violins given by Mrs. Bryant. In the years following the Bryant gift to the Museum, several other important violins were acquired by American institutions, including the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, the Library of Congress, Yale University, the Smithsonian Institution, and the University of South Dakota. Since the early 1930s the Metropolitan Museum, too, has acquired many other fine Ital ian instruments, both bowed and plucked. In 1955 a third Stradivari vio lin was added to the collection, a 1693 long pattern named "The Gould" after its donor, George Gould (fig. 75). A violin by Nicolò Amati, regarded as the greatest maker of the Amati family and thought to have been Stradivari's teacher, was donated to the Museum by Evelyn Stark in 1974 (fig. 76, cen ter). In the 1970s it and "The Gould" were restored and refitted according to Baroque specifications so that they could be played at early music perfor mances at the Museum. "The Gould" is the only Stradivari violin in Baroque setup that is playable, and it is used at the Museum several times each year. 75. Antonio Stradivari. Violin, "The Gould." Cremona, 1693.

Perhaps the most important vio lin in the Museum's collection is an instrument made by Andrea Amati that was purchased with funds from the Robert Alonzo Lehman estate in 1999 (see fig. 10). Two unusual bowed instruments by great Italian makers have entered the Museum in the past decade, a festoon-shaped viola d'amore of 1701 by Giovanni Grancino of Milan (fig. 77), who was the teacher of Carlo Testore, and an exquisite viola d'amore by Johannes Guidantus of Bologna from the middle of the eighteenth century that survives in remark ably original condition (figs. 78, 79). Several fine plucked stringed instruments acquired in the past few decades represent the traditions of northern Italy during the Renaissance and Baroque periods. The rare early stringed instrument from the begin ning of the fifteenth century (figs. 2, 3) came to the Museum as part of the Irwin Untermyer collection in 1964. The magnificent Baroque guitar attributed to Giacomo Ertel of Rome (fig. 9) arrived in 1984, the stunning archlute by David Tecchler of Rome of about 1725 (fig. 7) was acquired in 1988, and a late seventeenth-century lute by Wendelin Tieffenbrucker came to the Museum in 1989. The exquisite Matteo Sellas guitar from the early seventeenth century (fig. 8) was acquired in 1990, and the lute by Pietro Railich (fig. 6) and a charming mandolin from the early eighteenth century (fig. 80) were both acquired in 2008. The Museum continues to collect examples of fine stringed instruments by the most important Italian makers and schools. 77. Giovanni Grancino (Italian, 1637-1709). Viola d'amore. Milan, 1701.
