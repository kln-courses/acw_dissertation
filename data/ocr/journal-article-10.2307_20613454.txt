<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Salmon: Their Fight for Survival, by Anthony Netboy. Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, 1974. Illustrations. Maps. Appendix. Bibliography. Index. 613 pp. $15. By diligent search of the literature and through many interviews, Mr. Netboy has assembled a wealth of information on salmon on both shores of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. American readers will find much that is new to them in his account of the genus Salmo in Europe and of the genus Oncorhyncus in Asia, areas about which we are generally poorly informed. The arrangement of the material is most helpful. Although [89]</page><page sequence="2">sometimes a bit flowery, the author has blended his information into smooth prose that is liberally sprinkled with footnotes for convenience of those readers who wish to know his sources or who want to go to his sources for more detail. Although Mr. Netboy gives figures on the sport catches of salmon and steelhead from time to time, he fails to develop the story of the im pact of the sport fishery on the salmon and steelhead as he has done for the commercial fishery. Consequently the reader is left with the impres sion that everyone except the sport fishermen is blamed for the depletion of the stocks of those fishes, with the commercial fisherman bearing the major part of the blame. But this is not so. In recent years, and depend ing on the race of chinook salmon or steelhead that is fished in the Columbia River from its mouth upstream to Bonneville Dam, the ratio of fish caught by sportsmen to those caught by commercial gillnetters has ranged from a low of one to three up to a high of around 15 to one. When sportsmen can catch 15 times as many fish as the commercial fish ermen, the sport fishery cannot be ignored.* A large part of the book is devoted to supplementary subjects. The author digresses into the areas of Indian legend and into the socio-eco nomic-political fields. He also indulges in his own philosophies and an occasional anthropomorphism. But many of his digressions are interest ing, and authors do enjoy the privilege of expressing personal opinions. On the whole, the many facets of his very broad subject have been covered well.
