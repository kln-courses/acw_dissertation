New archaeological data and further studies focused on spe- cific aspects of the Liangzhu culture help to clarify the relationships between Liangzhu and other contemporary neolithic cultures, particularly of Eastern Chi- na and, more generally, in reassessing the knowledge we have of the very begin- nings of early Chinese art3. Liangzhu iconography can be defined as being basically centered around two main motifs: the «mask» motif, conventionally called shoumian by Chi- nese scholars, and the «bird», or «bird-related» motif. Given their occurrence both motifs overshadow, in statistical terms, any other to be found in Liangzhu art, such as an alleged version of the «dragon»4 motif and animal shaped orna- 1 This paper is part of a broader Research Project on the art of early China directed by Prof. Ma- ria Teresa Lucidi, whom I would like to thank, as always, for her invaluable comments and sugge- stions. 2 For a detailed summary of the discoveries concerning the Liangzhu culture and an analysis of the jade material, see the informative article by Sun Zhixin, «The Liangzhu Culture: Its Discovery and Its Jades», Early China , n. 18, 1993, pp. 1-40. A briefer introduction to Liangzhu is also offered by HUANG Tsui-Mei in the article «Liangzhu: a late Neolithic jade-yelding culture in southeastern coastal China», Antiquity , 66, 1992, pp. 75-83. The same author has dealt extensively with this topic in his The role of Jade in the Late Neolithic Culture of Ancient China: The Case of Liangzhu, PhD thesis, Uni- versity of Pittsburgh, 1992. 3 On this topic, see the remarks made by ANGUS FORSYTH in Jades from China , Bath 1994, pp. 52-86, p. 58. 4 «Dragon» is labelled a variant of the mask motif occurring on bracelets and round pendants unearthed at the Fanshan and Yaoshan (Yuhang, zhegiang pron.) sites, such as a huang- pendant from Yaoshan Mll:94 and annular ornaments from Yaoshan Mll:59, M2:17, Fanshan M22:8, 1/6, all re- produced in Mou Yong Kang Liangzhu wenhua yuqi (Jades of the Liangzhu culture), Beijing and Hong Kong 1989, fig. 120- 121, 217, 218, 219 respectively. A detailed discussion of these objects, and their decoration, has been made by Rui GuOYAO and Shen YUEMING, «Liangzhu wenhua yu Shang</page><page sequence="2">134 Filippo Salviati [2] ments5. Their frequency on jade artefacts6 - regarded to be liqi or «ritual items»7, ornaments and objects denoting the social status of the owner - seems to indicate a religious function for these images, which may thus represent a «visual» rende- ring of the beliefs of the Liangzhu people. Moreover, a careful analysis reveals that the shoumian and the «bird and bird-related» images are closely associated one with the other. I consider this point to be of great interest, given also the fact that these motifs play a relevant ro- le in the art of other Neolithic cultures of Eastern China, preceeding, contempo- rary or slightly later than Liangzhu. Objects excavated from sites dating to the early phase of the Liangzhu cultu- re and decorated with the shoumian and/or the bird motifs, demonstrate that the- se images were already used during the initial stage of Liangzhu to decorate arte- facts produced by this culture. The first dated appearance of the mask motif on Liangzhu jades is on a zhuo- bracelet from Wuxian Zhanglingshan8 (fig. 1), thought to be by some authors the prototype from which the cong , - a ritual object whose «invention»9 can now be safely attributed to the Liangzhu culture - was derived10.

Chang, The Archaeology of Ancient China , Yale Univ. Press, 1986, p. 2:54). 7 Cfr.

The belly of the jar (fig. 2) is ri- chly decorated with a variety of motifs including, according to the description of- fered by Chinese archaeologists, a sort of «feline» face seen frontally, provided with slanting eyes and fang-like appendages - the shoumian - and flanked by re- presentations of birds12. I should like to point out that this is the same scheme which occurs quite fre- quently on types of jades of the middle phase of the Liangzhu culture, such as cong (Yuhang Fanshan M12:98 (fig. 3), M12:93 and M20:124; Qingpu Fuquan- shan M6:21 (fig. 4 e 5), huang- pendants (Fanshan M23:67, fig. 6), «three-prong- ed» ornaments (Fanshan M14:135, fig. 7), ^«-«headdress» ornaments (Fanshan M22:ll; Yuhang Yaoshan M2:l, fig. 8). Jades decorated with these motifs 12 Other authors have discussed the jar and the motifs carved on it. ELIZABETH Childs- JOHNSON, «The Shang Bird: Intermediary to the Supernatural», Orientations , vol. 20, n. 11, November 1989, pp. 53-61, has suggested that the shoumian and the birds accompanying it may represent, as a group, the neolithic antecedant of the later Shang taotie accompanied by birds (p. 61). However, the author has not taken into consideration the other occurrences of the scheme, seen on Liangzhu jades. An Zhimin «Guanyu Liangzhu wenhua de ruogan wenti» (Some problems concerning the Liangzhu culture), Kaogu , 1988, 3, pp. 236-245, considers instead, more simply, the mask carved on the neo- lithic pottery jar as the antecedant of the shoumian motif seen on the Liangzhu jades (p. 241). Howev- er, given the peculiarity of this pottery jar -which at present seems to be a unicum in the ceramic production of the Liangzhu culture- and of its archaeological context, I will discuss it more extensively on another occasion.</page><page sequence="4">136 Filippo Salviati [4] Fig. 2 - Drawing of the motifs carved in intaglio on the ceramic bowl excavated from the well near Lake Deng, Wu county, Jiangsu province (After: Wenwu ziliao congkan 1985, 9).

The outline of the objects recalls the feathered headdress worn by the shoumian (After: Liangzhu wenhua yuqi , fig. 121). It has also to be noted that there are other important similarities between the Fuquanshan, Yaoshan and Fanshan finds that need to be examined more extensi- vely. Jade pendants naturalistically carved in the form of a bird with small loop holes on their backs, probably meant for suspension, have been brought to light in graves of the Fanshan (M14:259, M15:5, M16:2, M17:60, fig. 9) and Yaoshan (M2:50) sites14; on the other hand, grave M126:3 of the Fuquanshan site has yel- ded a small jade carving of a bird in profile15 (fig. 10): no other jades of this kind 14 There have also been attempts to try to relate these images of birds to real zoological species, on the basis of the stylistic differences occurring in the treatment of the bird motifs. ZHANG MlNGHUA, in his «Liangzhu yu fu shitan» (A discussion of Liangzhu jade symbols), Wenwu , 1990, 12, pp. 32-36, has proposed to identify three of the jade birds from the Fanshan (M14:259 and M17:60) and Yaoshan (M2:50) sites as a sparrow, a dove and a swallow respectively, also suggesting that the birds carved on the cong from Fuquanshan M6:21 could be representations of quails. Though such an approach might appear somewhat hazardous, it is certainly worth asking if these differences in the treatment of each bird were deliberately made to distinguish the various species of birds and which was the significance of such a differentiation. 15 The broken bottom edge of the jade bird seems to indicate that originally it was probably part of a more complex object: ZHANG MlNGHUA and WANG Huijin, in their article «Taihu diqu xinshiqi shidai de taowen» (On Neolithic pottery inscriptions from the Taihu area), Kaogu, 1990, 10, pp. 903-</page><page sequence="8">140 Filippo Salviati [8] Fig. 9 - Four small jade carvings of birds from graves of the Fanshan site, Liangzhu culture (Af- ter: Liangzhu wenhua yuqi, fig. 198).</page><page sequence="9">[9] Bird and Bird-related motifs in the iconography of the Liangzhu culture 14 1 Fig. 10 - Drawing of a jade bird from grave n.126 of the Fuquanshan site, Liangzhu culture (Af- ter: Wenwu, 1990, 12, fig. 1:2, p. 33). are presently known from archaeological excavations16. Stylized representations of birds, either seen frontally or in profile, occur also on a number of pottery vessels, almost exclusively17 ding- tripods, ¿«-ewers and dou- stands, some of the most re- current shapes in funerary assemblages of the Liangzhu culture18. The vessels have been unearthed at Fuquanshan (three hu from graves T27M2:66, 166 - fig. 11 - and T22M5:219 and a dou from M101-.9020, fig. 12); Wuxian Caoxieshan (two lidd- 907, suggest to compare this jade bird from Fuquanshan with the motifs etched on three ¿/-disks in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, representing a bird in profile standing on top of a geometric ele- ment. The Freer ¿/-disks have been discussed by numerous scholars: amongst them see Deng Shu- PING, «The Mystery of the Markings on Jades of the Liangzhu Culture», National Palace Museum Bul- letin, vol. XXVII, nn. 5-6, November-December 1992, January-February 1993, pp. 9-26. In the pre- sent article, I have not discussed the Freer ¿/-disks and other jade objects decorated with similar et- chings -which include bird motifs-, for the simple reason that all these objects, presently housed in Eu- ropean, American, Taiwanese and Chinese collections, do not come from controlled excavations. Hen- ce, their exact cultural attribution still remains, in my view, uncertain. 16 There are a few other unprovenanced examples which have turned out on the market. In an antique dealer's premises in Hong Kong, I have personally examined the jade carving of a bird which in shape, style and kind of material is very similar to the jade bird excavated at Fanshan from grave M 16:2. Archaeologically uninvestigated Liangzhu burials were and still are today a main source of jade objects for tomb robbers, and farmers of the area are known since the 1930's, as «jade hunters» (see the account in SIDNEY KAPLAN, «Early Pottery from the Liang Chu site, Chekiang Province», Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America, III, 1948-1949, p. 15). In 1992, during a visit at the Yaoshan site, I could spot many holes, recently dug by local farmers, in the soil nearby the site. It is worth remem- bering that grave M 12 of the Yaoshan site was first discovered by tomb plunderers and its content re- covered later on (Sun ZhIXIN, Op. cit., p. 21; see also YUHANGXIAN WENWU GUANLI WEIYUANHUI BAN- GONGSHI, «Zhejiangshen Yuhangxian Anxi Yaoshan 12hao mu kaogu jianbao» (Report on the excava- tion of tomb 12 of the Yaoshan site), Dongnan wenhua, 1988, 5, pp. 41-48). 17 The only exception being at present represented by a zun from Qingpu Xiyangdian, decorated with the motif of a «flying bird» alternated with that of a running bird with a long neck, interpreted as an «ostrich» (see entry n. 37, in Gems of the Liangzhu culture from the Shanghai Museum, Hong Kong 1992, pp. 120-121). 18 1 have discussed this material in my paper, «Decorated pottery vessels from the Fuquanshan site of the Liangzhu Neolithic culture», presented at the Symposium on Chinese Archaeology, London, School of Oriental and African Studies, 11-13 november 1992. 19 Reproduced in the archaeological report, Shanghaishi WENWU BAOGUAN WEIYUANHUI, «Shanghai Qingpu Fuquanshan Liangzhu wenhua mudi» (Tombs of the Liangzhu culture at Qingpu Fuquanshan, Shanghai), Wenwu, 1986, 10, pp. 10-25, fig.34:l, 2 and 3. 20 Reproduced in Gems of the Liangzhu culture..., op. cit., entry n. 25, pp. 96-97. 1 would like to thank dr.

Furthermore, because of their decoration, these vessels stand quite apart in the ceramic production of the Liangzhu culture, dominated, as it is, by vessels chiefly of dark clay tempered with fine sand, often with black coating, general- ly undecorated or presenting geometric patterns as well as cut-out designs25. Apart from bird motifs, the few decorated pottery vessels can present another pattern, spiralling or «S»-shaped motifs provided with «pointed» or «hooked» protuberances (fig. 11): the latter are very close to the projections seen on the 21 NANJING BOWUYUAN, «Jiangsu Wuxian Caoxieshan yizhi» (The Caoxieshan site, Wu county, Jiangsu), Wenwu ziliao zongkan , 3, 1980, pp. 1-24, fig.69:2, 3. 22 Shanghaishi wenwu BAOGUAN WEIYUANHUI, «Shanghaishi Songjiangxian Guangfuling xin- shidai yizhi shitan» (Trial excavation of the neolithic site of Songjiang Guangfuling, Shanghai), Kaogu, 1962, 9, pp. 465-469, fig.5:4.

These spiralling patterns can be seen on the body of a hu and on the lid of a ding excavated from the same grave - M198.IL7, 8 and 2 - of the Caoxieshan site; on other vessels excavated at Fuquanshan (on the lid and partly on the body of a ding from T22M5:90; on the body of two hu from grave T27M2:66 and 166; on the stem of a tall dou from M101:90), and fi- nally on two pottery fragments of vessels found at Liangzhu and at Jinshan Ting- ling, Shanghai26 (fig. 15). Although the significance of these spiralling patterns is not exacdy known27, it could be argued that - together with the bird motifs - they have been chosen to decorate vessels which had a ritual purpose or were indicators of a particular sta- tus of the tomb occupant. 26 Reproduced in An Zhimin, «Guanyu Liangzhu wenhua de ruogan wenti...», op. cit., p. 243. 27 Although they have been assumed to be representations of «curly snakes».

The conclu- sion seems to be that certain Liangzhu sites such as Fuquanshan and Yaoshan - linked together by a number of evidence, amongst which the recurrent bird mo- tifs used to decorate artefacts excavated from graves in these two cemeteries, were not only used as burial areas for members of the religious and/or political élite of the Liangzhu society, but also served as ceremonial centres, as the presence of the altars seem to indicate30. Whichever the religion of the Liangzhu people might have been, it thus seems beyond doubt that the bird and the shoumian played a relevant role in the rituals associated with it. The shoumian motif has variously been interpreted as the image of the ancestor of the Liangzhu people - and thus the cong with the shoumian serially repeated on its tiers has been interpreted as a sort of «totemic pole»31; as a symbol of social prestige and power indicating the highest social sta- tus in Liang-zhu society; as a deity, a spirit, worshipped by the Liangzhu people32; 28 For a discussion of the characteristic of the Fuquanshan site, see HUANG XuANPEl's «Liangzhu culture», introduction to Gems of the Liangzhu culture , op. cit., p. 30, and, by the same author, «Fuquanshan yizhi faxian de wenming jixiang» (Evidences of civilization discovered at the Fu- quanshan site), Kaogu , 2, 1993, pp. 144-149: the altar remains and decorated pottery vessels are di- scussed in paragraph 2 (pp. 147-149), devoted to the ritual objects unearthed at the site. 29 ^The total area of the altar and grave sites is approximately 588 square metres. The altar, about 400 metres square, was build of red earth on a foundation of yellow earth, both brought from a distance for the purpose» (Jean M. JAMES, «Images of Power: Masks of the Liangzhu Culture», Orientations , vol. 22, n. 6, June 1991, pp. 46-55, quotation from p. 47). It is worth noting that a third Liangzhu altar has been recently excavated in the Yuhang Huiguanshan site, Zhejiang. The altar has a rough rectangular shape, measuring 1600 square metres and is subdivided in three separate areas di- stinguished by earth of slightly different colours. In the south-west corner of the site Chinese archaeo- logists have excavated four graves: the larger one, which measures 4.75x2.6 metres and is rich in burial goods, has yelded 48 stone axes. The discovery, which has not yet been fully reported (see the descrip- tion of the site given by Liu Bin and WANG Yunlu, «Yuhang Huiguanshan yizhi faxian jitan he da- mu», The altar remains and great tombs at the Huiguanshan site, Zhongguo wenwu bao , August 11, 1991, p.l), is highly significant for what concerns the study of the ceremonial centres of the Liangzhu culture. On all these altar remains, see my entry «Altari (estremo oriente)» in the Enciclopedia Archeo- logica , Rome (in print). 30 For a discussion on these altar remains, see Xu Shunzhan, «Lun Liangzhu wenhua zhong yuanshi zongjiao de guifanhua» (An enquiry about the religious beliefs of the Liangzhu culture), Dong- nan wenhua , 4, 1990, pp. 245-248, part. pp. 247-248. 31 Deng Shuping, «Xinshiqi shidai de yucong» (Neolithic jade cong), Gugong wenwu yuekan , vol. 34, 1985, pp. 44-52: see also the discussion on the possible totemic value of this image in Tang Funian, «Liangzhu wenhua yuqi shenren wenshi he you guanzhe wenti» (The motif of the «spirit» image on the Liangzhu jades and related questions), Gugong bowuyuan yuankan , 3, 1993, pp. 76-85, 81-82. 32 This is, generally speaking, the most widely accepted view.</page><page sequence="15">[15] Bird and Bird-related motifs in the iconography of the Liangzhu culture 147 or, finally, as an image alluding to shamanistic beliefs, if not itself the representa- tion of a shaman33. Central to the latter interpretation is not only the bottom part of the shoumian - the mask motif with animal characteristics which could be in- terpreted as the «vehicle» of the shaman - but also the feathered headdress worn by the human-like figure, an element which could allude to the shaman's flight and connect him with the realm of the birds, the sky34 (fig. 14). The importance of the feathered headdress in the iconography of Liangzhu art is also stressed by a particular kind of object, significantly called ^¿^-«head- dress» ornament because of the close resemblance its outline has with the feat- hered headdress of the shoumian (fig. 8). Jades of this kind have been unearthed at a number of Liangzhu sites35, but of particular interest is the case of the Yao- shan and Fanshan cemeteries, where each intact grave - 11 at Yaoshan and 9 at Fanshan - has yelded a «headdress-shaped» jade, positioned near the head of the deceased. The fact that jades of this kind are always provided with a perforated tenon at their base, suggest that they were probably secured on a frame made of perishable material36, and thus might have been worn as ritual insignia by their owner. If this was, as it seems to be, the case, I believe that such ornaments helped in establishing a relationship between the wearer of the jades and the image repre- sented on them, the shoumian motif, whose feathered headdress was symbolically transferred to the person, by virtue of the outline itself of the headdress-shaped ornaments. 33 K.C.

Mou YONGKANG, «Richesse and Ritual: The Impetus of Liangzhu Jades», in Jade, op. cit., pp. 84-87, has ad- vanced the interpretation that these objects, given also their small dimensions and the position they oc- cupy in burials could have been ornaments not worn by the occupant of the tomb, but placed on a «wooden deity» which has decayed and left no traces. In his words, «it is possible that there existed at that time sculptures of spirits, probably made of wood or other perishable materials, which were part of the headpiece but have not survived» (p. 86).</page><page sequence="16">148 Filippo Salviati [16] According to some authors37, antecedents of the hat-shaped jades of the Liangzhu culture can be detected amongst artefacts of the Yuyao Hemudu cultu- re, namely small wooden objects shaped like birds when seen in profile, provided with a tenon and a hole, probably meant to secure them on some other element (fig. 16). It has to be noted that bird imagery played a relevant role in Hemudu Fig. 16 - Wooden objects of the Hemudu culture (After Kaogu xuebao , 1978, 1, p. 63. 37 Hayashi Minao, «Jades of the Liangzhu culture» (in Japanese), Museum , n. 360, 1981, pp. 22-23; Mou YONGKANG, «Liangzhu yuqi shang shen chongbai de tansuo» (An enquiry on the spirit fi- gure carved on Liangzhu jades), Qingzhu Su Bingqi kaogu wushiwunian lunwenji , Beijing 1989, pp. 191-192.</page><page sequence="17">[17] Bird and Bird-related motifs in the iconography of the Liangzhu culture 149 art: seven ivory artefacts recovered from the fourth layer of the Hemudu site38, are decorated with representations of birds, some of them appearing in pairs, he- raldically arranged around a central, circular pattern39 (fig. 17).

CHANG, «An Essay on Cong, », op. cit., images of birds in Hemudu art «un- doubtedly foreshadowed the bird imageries on the jade cong of the Liangzhu culture, found in the sa- me area but dated approximately two thousand years later» (p. 41). The chronological gap between Hemudu and Liangzhu is mainly due to a still fragmentary archaeological knowledge of the detailed cultural sequence in the area of the Hangzhou bay, where the type sites of the two cultures have been identified. However, although our knowledge of the Hemudu culture is still mainly confined to the di- scoveries made at this site, it is beyond doubt that certain important features of the Hemudu - rice cultivation, relatively sophisticated weaving techniques, use of lacquer, highly developed carpentry are shared by the Liangzhu culture as well.</page><page sequence="18">150 Filippo Salviati [18] dent of the birds -shoumian motif -, is a motif engraved on a Hemudu pottery ves- sel and representing two animals in profile - the one on the left apparently a bird - flanking a central pattern formed by a curved line, on top of which rests a trape- zoidal ornament and below it, two circles (fig. 18). The general impression is that this motif could possibly be a sort of stylized mask, with the two circles standing for the eyes, the top line for the head and the trapezoidal element for a sort of headdress, which recalls, in virtue of its outline and the parallel lines incised within it, the Liangzhu feathered headdress. If certain motifs elaborated by the Hemudu culture seem to reappear, thou- gh in different forms and media, in the iconographie repertoire of the Liangzhu culture, it is arguable that Liangzhu in turn was responsible of what can be ter- med a «process of propagation» of, amongst other cultural traits, some of its most Fig. 18 - Drawing of a «mask» motif incised on a ceramic bowl from the Hemudu culture site (After: Kaogu Xuebao, 1978, n. 1).</page><page sequence="19">[19] Bird and Bird-related motifs in the iconography of the Liangzhu culture 15 1 peculiar images, such as the combination shoumian- bird motifs, or iconographical elements like the headdress40. A jade pendant discovered at the Liangzhu site of Zhaolingshan, Jiangsu province (fig. 19) is carved in the shape of a kneeling hu- man figure from whose head protrudes a «staff», on top of which stands a bird in profile41. This particular composition - bird on top of a humanoid figure - is the Fig. 19 - Drawing of a jade pendant from Zhaolingshan, Liangzhu culture (After: Gugong wenwu yuekan, n. 118, 1993, fig. 32, p. 113). 40 In Liangzhu art, this element will remain a constant attribute of the human-like figure of the shoumian motif, which even in its most simplified form retains a stylized version of the feathered head- dress. I am referring to the striated band of parallel lines commonly seen on top of the mask with hu- manoid features carved on the tiers of the cong , particularly the taller ones, decorated only with this version of the shoumian motif. This element thus seems to be a prerogative of the human-like figure - it reinforces its relationship with bird images -, and is never associated with the mask motif with ani- mal characteristics. Although it could be argued that some jades - headdress-shaped ornament, huang and three-pronged ornament from Fanshan M17:8, M12:85 and M14:135 - are decorated only with the animal part of the shoumian motif and present a reduced, though detectable, version of the head- dress, I believe that in all these cases, and other with similar characteristics, the feathered headdress, suggested in an abbreviated form, stands for the human-like mask. In any case, my opinion is that the two masks should be seen not as separate elements, but as an integral entity forming a global image which can occur in several graphic variants, none of which affect the recognizability of the motif and hence the values, whichever they were, the Liangzhu people attributed to this image. A similar view is held by SUN Zhixin, who interprets the shoumian image has being formed by a «half-human figure and a mask... The figure sits with two clawed legs and ... its two arms hold a large mask in front of its trunk» {op. cit., pp. 28-30 and note 100). 41 See Su Qiong, «Zhaolingshan chutu de liangjian yuqi» (Two jades unearthed at Zhaoling- shan), Zhongguo wenwubao , August 2, 1992, p. 1.

However, since the archaeological re- port of the excavation of the Shijiahe site has not yet been fully published, the question -with all its im- plications- remains open, though Zhou Nanquan opinion is certainly worthy of mention. It is clear that all these unprovenanced jades generally labelled as «Longshan», will need to be thoroughly reexami- ned in the light of the most recent archaeological discoveries, so as to provide them with a correct at- tribution.

All these similarities have been explained in various ways. From the archaeo- logical point of view, it is evident that in the China of the IV-III millennium BC, as proposed by K.C. Chang in his theoretical model45, there existed various «inte- raction spheres». In their process of diffusion, several regional Chinese neolithic cultures began to interact with each other, sometimes on an unexpected scale. In Eastern China, contacts occurred between the Dawenkou culture of Shandong and Liangzhu, are for example testified by the simultaneous presence of Liangzhu jades and Dawenkou ceramic vessels in burials of the Xinyi Huating site, JlNPENG, «Lun Linqu Zhufeng Longshan wenhua yuguanshi ji xianguan wenti» (On the jade head- dress of the Longshan culture from Linqu Zhufeng and related problems), Kaogu 1994, 1, pp. 55-65, who groups together evidence of headdresses from the Longshan, Dawenkou and Liangzhu cultures. 45 K.C.

While turquoise is extremely rare amongst the finds of the Liangzhu culture, it seems on the contrary a mate- rial preferred by the Dawenkou culture, where it was used to inlay bone artefacts. However, evidence of relationships between the two cultures go beyond the few listed here. For an overall view of the problem and a discussion focused also on bird imagery, see Du JlNPENG, «Guanyu Dawenkou wenhua yu Liangzhu wenhua de jige wenti» (Some problems concerning the Dawenkou and Liangzhu cultu- res), Kaogu , 1992, 10, pp. 915-923.</page><page sequence="24">156 Filippo Salviati [24] view, Wu Hung has pointed out the frequency of bird imagery in the art of Neo- lithic cultures of Eastern China, which, as he explains, probably represents the vi- sual manifestations of the beliefs of the ethnic groups who inhabitated this vast area in Neolithic times and which were collectively known, in ancient textual sources, as the «Eastern Yi» {Dong Yi) or «Bird Yi»48. The Liangzhu culture, be- cause of the frequent occurrence of bird and bird- related images which I have di- scussed here, can thus rightly be regarded as having been part of this larger group. But a fundamental question still remains to be investigated in detail: which was the probable meaning of this bird imagery and above all which were the reli- gious values attached to birds amongst the Neolithic cultures of Eastern China and of Liangzhu in particular? I believe that, to be properly answered, this que- stion requires a compound approach which would benefit from the investigative methods proper to different disciplines: archaeology, linguistic studies, compara- tive mythology, ethno-anthropological researche. Useful insights could also be gained from a cautious comparative analysis of specific aspect of Liangzhu icono- graphy -such as the feathered headdress- with similar ones to be found amongst cultures other than the Chinese one. Scholars have pointed out aspects of what could be termed the «legacy» of the Liangzhu culture. These range from specific objects49 to funerary practices50, iconographie motifs51 and, possibly, religious beliefs or ideas52. One of the most interesting and intriguing aspect of the whole question, is certainly represented by 48 Wu Hung, «Birds Motif...», op. cit., and his introduction to the catalogue Chinese Jades from the Mu Fei collection , op. cit. See also Shi Xingbang, «Woguo dongfang yanhai he dongnan diqu gu- dai wenhuazhong niaolei tuxiang yu niao zuzong bai de youguan wenti» (Some questions concerning the bird-like images and the bird ancestry cult amongst ancient Chinese cultures of the Eastern coastal and South-Eastern areas), in Zhongguo yuanshi wenhua lunji (ed. by Tian Changwu &amp; Shi Xingbang), Beijing 1989, pp. 234-266 49 In particular the cong- tube and the ¿/-disk, which remained in use throughout the Bronze Age and beyond. On the ¿/-disk and its eventual derivation from the spindle whorl, see JEAN M. Green, «Unraveling the Enigma of the Bi : The Spindle Whorl as the Model of the Ritual Disk», Asian Per- spectives, vol. 32, n. 1, 1993, pp. 105-124. 50 The practice of burying high-ranking individuals with objects in jade used as funerary articles - and not only regarded as precious items, but also thought to possess peculiar properties-, can be tra- ced in time as far as the Western Han period (206 B.C. -AD 24). 51 The Liangzhu shoumian has been thought by several authors to represent the antecedent of the Shang taotie. See in particular Li XUEQIN, «Liangzhu culture...», op. cit., and Ladislav Kesner, «The taotie reconsidered: Meanings and Functions of Shang Teriomorphic Imagery», Artibus Asiae, vol. LI, 1/2, 1991, pp. 29-53. Sun Zhixin, op. cit., is another author who points to Eastern China as a channel for the transmission of Liangzhu iconography to Shang art. 52 Yang Lin, «Zhongguo gudai yiwushang de biaoshi de «qi» zhi tuxiangxing biaoxian» (Figurai manifestations of the qi as depicted on ancient Chinese relics), Gugong xueshi jikan, vol. 9, 1, Autumn 1991, pp. 31-74, pp. 49 ff. devoted to an analysis of Hemudu, Liangzhu, Longshan and Shang iconography.</page><page sequence="25">[25] Bird and Bird-related motifs in the iconography of the Liangzhu culture 151 the fact that cultural traits ascribable to Liangzhu seem to disappear with the end of the culture itself, to reemerge much later on, during the Spring and Autumn (770-475 B.C.), Warring States (475-221 B.C.) and Han (206 B.C.-AD 220) pe- riods: Liangzhu has thus been regarded, for example, as the «ancestor» of the Wu and Yue cultures which developed in the same geographical areas53. In addition, in the framework of this overall context, I would like to advance the idea that the particular association of bird motifs with the shoumian with hu- manoid features, discussed here, could represent one of the possible antecedants of the xian -the feathered beings- common in Han art54. Liangzhu provides us infact, with one of the earliest depiction in Chinese art of a being of a non-terre- strial nature but with clear humanoid traits, represented together with images of birds and provided with a large headdress very likely made up of bird feathers, «riding», or simply over-imposed, on an animal mask (see fig. 14). Similar icono- graphie characteristics occur in the representation of the Han xian : they have a human-like appearance, their body is covered with feathers or they may be provi- ded with a pair of wings, both elements mediated from birds and equating the xian to the realm of the "heaven": lastly, the xian are also often represented as ri- ding mythical animals. Further research is still needed to expand and verify this working hypothesis, which I have advanced here merely on the basis of iconographie comparisons and without assuming the existence of a direct filiation of the Han xian from Liangzhu imagery, given also the obvious different cultural contexts which produced these images and the beliefs associated to them. I would like however to conclude by stressing that the relevance of Liangzhu iconography in the broader context of the artistic production of ancient China is gradually assuming an unexpected role, with implications which are as yet too early to fully assess.
