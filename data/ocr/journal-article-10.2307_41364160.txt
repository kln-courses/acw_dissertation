Paranavitana, O.B.E., Ph.D., Archaeological Commissioner , Ceylon (Read in the absence of the lecturer by Basil Gray, M.A., Keeper of Oriental Antiquities , British Museum ) Dominions and Colonies Section, Tuesday, 14th February, 1950 C. E. P. Jayasuriya, Ceylon Government Trade Commissioner in the United Kingdom , in the Chair The Chairman : Before I jcall upon Mr. Gray to read this paper I should like to say a few words by way of personal explanation. My appearance on this platform this evening is purely fortuitous. The gentleman who should have occupied this Chair is no less a person than the High Commissioner, Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, who has unfortunately been delayed in Ceylon and so is not able to be present here today. I am sure you are all sorry that he is not here, and on his behalf I would like to offer his apologies. For myself, I can assure you that I consider it one of the highest honours I have ever enjoyed in this coyntry to be asked to occupy a Chair which is normally occupied by people who are truly great. I think I should also say a few words about the writer of today's paper. Dr. Paranavitana is really a true archaeologist. He follows in the tradition set up by people like Bell and John Still, who have done so much to wrest from the dark the secrets of Ceylon's art and culture. Mr. Gray has by no means an easy task before him, but I am sure he will be able to interpret to us not only the letter but also the spirit that underlies the paper. The following paper, illustrated by a film-strip, was then read : The history of Ceylon begins about the fifth century b.c. with the colonization of the island by an Aryan-speaking people from North India - the ancestors of the present-day Sinhalese. In the middle of the third century b.c., the ancient Sinhalese embraced Buddhism, as a result of the missionary ardour of the great Indian Emperor Aáoka. The elements of culture which the early settlers brought with them, enriched by Mauryan contacts and stimulated by the spiritual impulses of the Buddhist faith, developed in course of time to that aspect of the great Indian civilization which is distinctive of Ceylon. New streams of culture continued to flow in from the neighbouring continent throughout the centuries, but the inherent conservative character of an island people allowed but little modification, by these later influences, of the architectural forms and artistic motifs which they had come to regard as their own. With the inevitable ups and downs, this civilization continued to be creative up to the thirteenth century, when signs of exhaustion set in. 588</page><page sequence="2">2ND JUNE 1950 SINHALESE ART AND CULTURE S ^ "S ï 4 •i ^ i I li 5 с -û: ë a *§ ^ -K4 ? ^ ;f 8 ci '5 a s X p £i I « S 'I "3 ? -I. üf^ ^ "s ^ "s i I -Š-Í с le &lt;5û Ď О •Ь Ã cô a й D чЗ ¡Jh 589</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ND JUNE 1950 Figure 4.

During the first half of the eleventh century, the greater part of Ceylon was included in the dominions of the mighty Chola empire. Since about the thirteenth century, the northern tip and the eastern littoral of the island have been peopled by Tamils. This contact, not always hostile, with the Tamils has had little influence on the art and archi- tecture distinctive of the Sinhalese ; but a few notable architectural monuments and a series of superb bronzes bear witness to the periods of Tamil supremacy, A few buildings, professedly Dravidian in character, owe their existence to Sinhalese rulers or religious dignitaries who evidently had an admiration for that type of architecture. The examples of Dravidian art and architecture found in Ceylon follow the lines of those in South India and scarcely add anything to what one learns by a study of the great monuments of that art in its own home. The distinctive contribution which Ceylon has to make to a study of the art of India or of Asia as a whole lies therefore in the art of the Sinhalese. The architecture of the Sinhalese, in its earliest phase, was essentially wooden; of the palaces and shrines mentioned in the early chronicles, therefore, hardly any remains exist today. Stone came to be used for the flights of steps, the facings of platforms, doorways and pillars, the last very often embedded in clay or brick walls to perform very much the same function as that of a steel frame in a modern building. For a study of Indian architecture, Ceylon affords two types of buildings which have had a distinctive development in this island. Of these, the first is the circular shrine enclosing a stüpa , with concentric circles of graceful monolithic pillars which supported a domical roof of wooden construction. The type was not unknown in India, being represented in bas- reliefs as well as by a few rock-cut examples. In India itself, however, the apsidal caitya-hall replaced the circular at a very early date. In Ceylon, the circular shrine continued to be in vogue up to the fifteenth century. The most perfect example of this type, at Mandalagiri in the heart of the forest 14 miles to the north of Minnëri in the Anurädhapura District, has recently been conserved with great labour and care by the Archaeological Department (Figure 1). The second architectural type distinctive of Ceylon is the brick-built shrine with vaulted roof and massive walls, rising from a heavily moulded plinth. The type is not exactly paralleled in India itself or in any other region influenced by the Indian culture. There is, however, reason to surmise that it was evolved in Ceylon from prototypes of which no traces now remain in ancient India. The best preserved, though not the largest example of this type, the Thüpäräma at Polonnaruva, dates from the twelfth century. The most impressive monuments of the early period (second century b.c. to fourth century A.D.) are the giant stupas. The largest stüpa in Anurädhapura, the Jetavana (fourth century A.D.), is stated to have been 400 feet in height originally, and still stands, in its ruined condition, 281 feet above the platform on which it was built. All these stupas conformed to one pattern. They consisted 593</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ND JUNE 1940 Figure i. A circular shrine enclosing a stupa at Mandalagiri in the Anurãdhapura District of a solid dome of brick masonry on a basal terrace of three stages. The dome was surmounted by a solid cube of brick masonry over which was a series of umbrellas. Architecturally, the most interesting features of the early stupas are the altars or frontispieces at the cardinal points, formed of horizontal bands separated by string-courses. The most perfect example is at the Kantaka Cetiya at Mihintalë, the sacred hill eight miles east of Anurãdhapura. The limestone stelae which flank the frontispieces contain the oldest specimens of the plastic art of Ceylon so far known. In the sculptures from the frontispieces of earlier date ( circa second century A.D.), some of the motifs, such as the foliated scroll rising from a vase, are reminiscent of the Buddhist art of Central India as represented by the bas-reliefs of Bharhut and Sanchi. In these early Sinhalese sculptures, just as in the examples of Indian plastic art referred to, we notice an aversion to depth and the treatment of the individual figures in a gradation of separate planes or as mere silhouettes. Bas-reliefs from the frontispieces of the Jetavana (fourth century) exhibit a more mature style and technique (Figure 2). One who is familiar with the 594</page><page sequence="8">2ND JUNE I950 SINHALESE ART AND CULTURE development of art in India will readily recognize a similarity between these and the sculptures of the Ãndhra School. The figures exhibit the same sinuous grace and the same vivaciousness as do those in the reliefs from Amarâvatï. In Ceylon have also been found a number of portable marble reliefs which by their style are stamped as works of that school. One such, illustrating a scene from a Buddhist story, is now in the Colombo Museum. The earliest type of the Buddha image known in Ceylon is that of the Ãndhra school. A life-size Buddha image of marble, obviously of South Indian origin, has recently been unearthed at an ancient site in Ceylon. There is epigraphical as well as literary evidence to indicate that a brisk intercourse existed in this period between the Buddhists of Ceylon and their co-religionists in the Kistna valley. It therefore appears that the school of sculptural art established in Ceylon during the earliest period of its history as a result of the cultural wave which affected its civilization in the time of Aáoka and the century or two which imme- diately followed, came into contact with the more mature art of the Ãndhra country and thereby improved its technique and modified its style. When we pass this earliest phase we have to come to the twelfth century to find stone sculptures which can be exactly dated, but there are many notable examples of plastic art which have to be ascribed to the period between the fifth and the twelfth centuries. The only means at our disposal to date these works is their style taken in relation to the stylistic evolution of sculpture in India, which is capable of chronological treatment. The characteristics of harmony, serenity and balance, the keynotes of Gupta art, are exhibited by a bas-relief of a pair of lovers on a granite slab now preserved at Isurumuni Vihãra of Anurädhapura (Figure 3). What the scene represented is, it is not possible to say. The female figure has been rendered with great charm; the suppleness of the limbs, the softness of the flesh and the expression of coyness, in the face are quite evident. In contrast are the coarse and sensual faciali features of the male figure, representing most probably a warrior. The cold and severe style of the Paliava school, best known from Mämal- lapuram in India, with the rather elongated limbs of the individual figures, comparative absence of ornament, and drapery clinging to the body, is represented in Ceylon by the well-known sculpture of Man and Horse (the so-called Rapila) on a rock at Isurumuni (Figure 4), and a life-size Bodhisattva image in the round, of which the arms are missing, found at Situlpavuva in the southern part of the island. Of the first of these two, Laurence Binyon said : "The rock-carved 'Rapila* ili Ceylon is a tremendous work, impossible to forget when once seen"*. The identification' of the scene, suggested by Coomaraswamy, solely based' on the presence of a horse behind the figure of the man, is extremely dubious; the pose known as mahãrãjalilã , in which the man is seated, is definitely against it. The same argument applies against the identification of the scene as the descent of Ganga. On either side of a cleft in the rock at Isurumuni Vihãra, bearing the so-called * Saturday Review, 18 February, 191 1, quoted by V. A. Smith, History of Fine Art in India and Ceylon, p. 95. 595</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ND JUNE I950 Kapila relief, there are carvings of elephants closer to the ground. The elephant on the right-hand side of the cleft (Figure 5) is in low relief, but is very vigorously delineated in the act of pouring water on itself with its trunk, which is uplifted and turned back. The arcist has been very successful in rendering the sagacious look of the beast; rarely has the elephant been represented in art in a manner truer to nature than in this relief. In the ancient edifices of Anurädhapura, it was the flight of steps at the entrance that received sculptural embellishment. The risers were ornamented with lotus-petal mouldings and figures of dwarfs are represented, in the manner of Atlantes, as supporting the structure on their heads. The side balustrades were ornamented with stylized figures of the makara , a composite animal found in Indian art of all ages and climes. But the most characteristic of the sculptures which adorn the flights of steps of ancient Sinhalese buildings are the stone slabs with rounded tops bearing anthropomorphic representations of serpent deities (Nãgas), and the profusely ornamented semi-circular slabs of stone found at the foot of the steps. As the Nãga figures on the slabs serve as guards at the entrance, the slabs on which they are represented are called guard-stones. The semi-circular slab of stone at the flight of steps was not unknown to Buddhist architecture in India in its early phase ; but it went out of vogue before the Gupta period. In Ceylon, however, it underwent a rich and varied develop- ment. It is referred to, in Sinhalese, by a word which means "half-moon stone" and has been rendered into English as "moon-stone". The most elaborately ornamented flights of steps are noticed at the circular shrine of Polonnaruva (Figure 6). There are several examples of guard-stones and moon-stones at the ancient sites which can be rated as first-class works of art. The guard-stone selected for notice here is now placed at the entrance to an edifice near the Thüpäräma shrine at Anurädhapura. The dignified poise of the figure, the serene expression of the face, the sensitive modelling of the limbs, particularly of the abdomen, and the treatment of the drapery are particularly noteworthy. The moon-stone noticed, in many respects the best of its type, is from a ruined structure in the Northern Monastery. The decorative scheme comprises an ornamental border, a row of animals - elephant, horse, lion and bull shown as if chasing one another - a foliated pattern of exquisite delicacy, a row of geese and conventionally treated lotus petals. The modelling of the various figures and the composition of the different decorative elements into a balanced whole reveal the touch of a master hand. There are at least three of these moon-stones at Anurädhapura, each of which can be called a masterpiece of Oriental Art*. In common with the rest of the Buddhist world, Ceylon, too, some time after the beginning of the Christian era, adopted the practice of worshipping images of Buddha. This innovation in the ritual aspect of religion afforded ample opportunities to the sculptor, some of the Buddha images being reckoned among his greatest achievements. As already remarked, the earliest type of ♦See Dora Gordine in Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland for 1946, p. 123. 596</page><page sequence="10">2ND JUNE I950 SINHALESE ART AND CULTURE the Buddha image seems to have reached Ceylon through the Ãndhra country. This is an image in the round, with the right shoulder bare, and the drapery shown in regular schematic folds in relief. A somewhat mutilated Buddha image of this type, considerably more than life-size, found at the Ruvanväli Dägäba in Anurãdhapura, has been attributed to about the second century A.D. This image Figure 6. Moonstone and steps at the circular shrine of Polonnaruva (12 th century ) which is of crystalline limestone, of which material, indeed, are the vast majority of the early Buddha images found in Ceylon, has now lost much of its original character by being subjected to restoration by inexpert hands. To a period two centuries later, i.e., about the fourth century, has been attributed the well-known Buddha, seated in the attitude of meditation, at a ruined shrine close to the Northern or Abhayagiri Dägäba at Anurãdhapura. Of this image, too, the right shoulder is bare ; images with both shoulders covered are not known from Ceylon. The drapery, a very thin material, is shown as clinging to the body without folds. In this, as in other respects, this image has affinities to the type of Buddha found in the later cave temples of Ajantã. It is also worthy of note that the seated images of Buddha found in Ceylon are all in the attitude of meditation. An exception, however, is an image found at Pankuliya, one of the outlying monasteries of Anurãdhapura; it is in the abhaya - mudrã , the attitude of bestowing protection. In these two images, as well as in a number of others of the same age, the artists of old Ceylon had achieved no small measure of success in what they, 597</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ND JUNE I950 Figure 7. Colossal figure of the Buddha cut from the cliff face at the Gal-Vihãra in Polonnaruva (12 th century ) in common with the artists of other Buddhist lands, aimed at in fashioning an image of the Master - to visualize the Great Sage as the embodiment of Supreme Wisdom and Unbounded Compassion, serene in the peace of Nirvana. These two ideals of Wisdom and Compassion correspond to strength and grace in the aesthetic sphere and it is very rarely that perfect harmony of the two has been achieved in plastic form. The masterpieces of the Gupta age in India generally emphasized the quality of grace - this is in keeping with the emphasis which the Mahãyãnists laid on karunã , compassion. The best Buddha images of Ceylon, 011 the other hand, bring to the fore the quality of strength. The 598</page><page sequence="12">2ND JUNE 1950 SINHALESE ART AND CULTURE ancient Sinhalese artists evidently contemplated on the Buddha more as Dasabala than as Mahãkãrunika. Some time after the fifth century, there came into vogue the practice of carving colossal images of the Buddha on the faces of perpendicular rocks. There are many examples of such sculptures in various parts of the island, the images being in the recumbent, seated or standing posture. Among such images, the first to be noticed by archaeologists was the well-known group at the Gal- Vih ära in Polonnaruva, definitely known to be a work of the twelfth century. The other examples of colossal images carved on rock have also been assumed to be of that date ; but closer study would indicate that the Polonnaruva group represents a late phase of this type of sculpture. The colossus at Avukana, carved almost in the round and measuring, with the pedestal, 42 feet in height, must belong to a date much anterior to the twelfth century, for the treatment of the drapery differs from that in vogue in the Polonnaruva period and is closer to the Amarâvatï style. In the rock-cut images of the Gal-Vihãra (Figure 7), the folds of the drapery are represented in what is called the groove method, i.e. each fold is marked by two grooves, one shallower than the other. The colossal images are, on the whole, stylized and hieratic; they are, however, impressive not only on account of their size but also by their strength and dignity. Specially note- worthy is the standing Buddha at the Gal-Vihãra, popularly called Ãnanda, for the arms are folded across the chest - an attitude quite unusual in Ceylon for an image of the Buddha. We bring to a close this brief notice of the stone sculpture of ancient Ceylon with a reference to a remarkable work of art to be seen at an ancient site called Potgul Vehera at Polonnaruva. It is an image of more than life-size and is carved on the face of a boulder of moderate dimensions (Figure 8). The subject is represented as holding, or rather balancing in the two hands, an object which has been wrongly taken to be a palm-leaf book. The popular belief is that the sculpture is a likeness of the great king Paräkramabähu ; but archaeologists have questioned this identification. Some have suggested that the sculpture may represent the sage Agastya, but the reasons given for this view are not convincing. The sculpture does not conform to any known iconographie types of Indian religions and also, somewhat unique in Indian art, it does not represent an idealized type. The artist has made a definite attèmpt to bring out individual character in the physiognomy. There is, therefore, a very great likelihood that the sculpture is meant to be the portrait of a king - whether of Paräkramabähu or any other, we cannot definitely say - as the upholder of order and even- handed justice. The treatment of the drapery, which is the same as in the Gal-Vihãra images, would indicate, if it be considered an adequate criterion, that the sculpture is of the twelfth century. Plastic art was also practised in stucco and terracotta, mainly for decorative purposes in architectural schemes. Two terracotta heads found at the Kantaka Cetiya of Mihintale exhibit the artist's work in this medium at its best (Figure 9). The stone-work found at the Kantaka Cetiya dates from about the beginning of the Christian era ; but there is no reason why the terracotta ornamentation of the 599</page><page sequence="13">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ND JUNE I950 upper part of the frontispieces, too, should belong to that period. These two heads may be taken as dating from about the fifth century, for they exhibit the Gupta characteristics of refinement and serenity. ' Ceylon also had produced many works of art in metal, mostly bronze ; and some of these are of high quality. An outstanding bronze is an image of a goddess, of which the exact find-spot has not been recorded, now in the British Museum ; it has been labelled Pattini, but on insufficient grounds. It shows very sensitive modelling; the artist evidently had mastered the technique appropriate to the material in which he worked. Except for the jewel (now lost) in the matted hair, the figure wears no jewelry and the atmosphere is one of simplicity and austereness. The image has been ascribed to the eighth century. Fkh'Ri: 8. A rock carving of a king at Potgul Veliera , Polonnaruva ( 1 2 til century) 600</page><page sequence="14">2ND JUNE 1950 SINHALESE ART AND CULTURE Much more benign in aspect and more ornate in treatment is a standing figure of Maitreya Bodhisattva discovered at Anurädhapura and now preserved in the Colombo Museum. It has been assigned, on grounds of style, to the period between the sixth and the seventh centuries. Suppleness and balance are given to the figure by its pose of tribhanga (a sort of Praxitelian bend). It may here be noted that the style of making an image bent at the knees, the waist and the shoulders is referred to in Ceylon writings as tivanka and is noticed in figure sculptures from very early times up to a comparatively recent period. Of unusual iconographie interest is a seated bronze image, 6 i inches in height, found recently at the Mandalagiri Vihãra (Figure 10). It represents a Buddha, wearing a diadem and ornaments, seated in the attitude of meditation. The right hand holds a double vajra , indicating that the image is of Vajra-sattva, a Buddha of the Mahãyãnists. The serene and benevolent expression in the face is noteworthy. Numerous examples of Buddha images of bronze, in the standing or sitting postures, are known from Ceylon. One recently found at the Ruvanväli Dägäba of Anurädhapura, which may date from about the fifth century, can definitely be pronounced to belong to the best period of Sinhalese sculpture. The last bronze selected for notice is a superb Natarãja figure found at Polonnaruva and now preserved in the Colombo Museum. The Natarãja type, as is well known, is one of the greatest creations of Indian art and symbolizes the dynamic activity of cosmic forces personified in the dance of God Šiva. In addition to the Natarãja figure, there have been found also at Polonnaruva, numerous other Šivaite bronzes of artistic and iconographie interest, among which may be mentioned images of Šaiva saints. These bronzes have been discovered at a ruined Šaiva shrine built during a period of Chola rule; they have probably been manufactured in South India, or are the work of artists who hailed from that country. They properly belong, therefore, to the art of the Tamil country. Ivory was another medium in which the artists of old Ceylon worked, A king of the fourth century was an adept in the art of ivory carving and trained many others in it. His handiwork, so the chronicler tells us, appeared to be the outcome of some magic. Time has spared none of the works of these masters; but an ivory statuette of the second century or thereabouts, recently discovered at the Ruvanväli Dägäba, deserves mention (Figure 11). It is unique for Ceylon and its nearest parallel is said to be an Indian ivory statuette found at Pompeii in 1938 or 1939*. Ceylon has had a long pictorial tradition. The chronicles, referring to very early times, mention painters and their work, and extant Sinhalese literary works often use similes and metaphors, the effectiveness of which depends on the reader being familiar with pictures and able to appreciate their good qualities. For example, Šri Rãhula, a poet of the fifteenth century, compares the narration of a story by the Buddha to the unfolding of a picture and, 111 elaborating the simile, parallels the colour scheme of the picture to the capacity of giving pleasure * Illustrated London News of 25th February 1939 001</page><page sequence="15">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ND JUNE 1950 which a good story possesses, and the structure (the line work and composition) of the former to the profound truths that may be realized by means of the latter. Among the verses scribbled by visitors to Sïgiri in the eighth and ninth centuries are some which emphasize that the skill of a painter lies in depicting the thoughts and feelings, not merely the outward appearance, of a person painted. Art criticism, therefore, was not unknown among the ancient Sinhalese. The materials on which the paintings were executed being not so durable as stone, there are comparatively few remains at present of an art which at one time was widely practised. The preservation of the few extant examples is due to their being in sheltered places or other fortuitous circumstances. We have no reason, therefore, to assume that what we now possess of this art is the best which the age produced, 01 is in any way typical. Even so, con- sidering its size, Ceylon has sufficient examples of the pictorial art of ancient times belonging to various periods and of a high standard of aesthetic quality. The oldest and the best preserved of these ancient paintings, well authenticated in date as belonging to the fifth century, are found in a cavity on the western face of the rock at Sïgiri, the wonderful rock-fortress of the parricide kingKassapa. There are 21 figures in all, some of them of a fragmentary character. The figures are of profusely bejewelled females depicted as rising from clouds; they are thus cut off at the waist. This circumstance indicates that the figures represent a class of celestial beings. We may, however, conclude that the models for these celestial beauties were furnished to the artists by the court ladies and other terrestrial beauties of the time; for, then as now, the artist, if he proceeded to heaven in his search for models, would not have cared to come back to earth even for the delectable pursuit of drawing nymphs on a rock. The figures now preserved are but a small fraction of the many hundreds which once adorned the whole face of the rock (Figure 12). It must indeed have been a magnificent spectacle, and visitors of the eighth and ninth centuries who saw it had burst into admiring song; many are the verses embodying their reactions to the sight which they have scrawled on the glass-like plaster of the gallery wall below. With regard to the aesthetic quality of these paintings, I quote the apt words of Benjamin Rowland** " The Sigiriya paintings, outside of their exciting and intrinsic beauty, are perhaps most notable for the very freedom they show at a period when the arts were tending to become more and more frozen in the mould of rigid canons of beauty. The apsaras have a rich healthy flavour that, by contrast, almost makes the masterpieces of Indian art seem sallow and effete in over refinement. Just as the drawing is more vigorous than that of the more sophisticated artists of India, so the colours are bolder and more intense than the tonalities employed in the temples of the Deccan. The loudness of the colour approaches but escapes vulgarity; in this respect it has much of the same bright and open charm that, for example, a peasant textile has in comparison to the stuff from the more sophisticated looms of the city." *The W all-Paintings of India , Central Asia and Ceylon, p. 84. 602</page><page sequence="16">12ND JUNE 1950 SINHALESE ART AND CULTURE The paintings of Sïgiri are purely of a secular character. Their purpose, in .addition to the delectation of the court circles, was to impress on the people the splendour and majesty of the king who resided in the palace on the summit of the rock. Neither the artists who painted them, nor the king at whose bidding they were created, were actuated by religious or spiritual motives. For paintings •due to the latter inspiration we have to go to ruined shrines or caves used for religious purposes. Fragmentary paintings in a cave at Hiňdagala, about nine miles from Kandy, represent the work of a school having much in common with the later phase of the art of Ajantã. The scene depicted here is, in my opinion, the visit •of Indra to Buddha and not Buddha in Tusita heaven, as Coomaraswamy has conjectured it to be. As at Ajantã, one scene merges into the other, the principal ►characters being repeated in each. A detail from this painting will convey an idea of the character of the art represented here. The date can be surmised as the sixth or seventh century. T о the same period has been assigned the fragment of a painting found in a cave near Dimbulägala in the North Central Province. What is now visible here depicts four haloed divinities seated on flowers, probably paying homage to the Buddha. In my opinion, it is more likely that this painting dates from the twelfth century. Dating from the twelfth to the thirteenth century there are, on the walls of the 'Tivañka shrine at Polonnaruva, a series of frescoes illustrating scenes from the life of Buddha and the Jätaka stories. These have been sadly neglected till recently, but what remains even now indicate that the classic Buddhist art retained its vitality in this island up to a comparatively late period. These paintings no doubt show a deterioration in quality when compared with the masterpieces of more spacious days, but even in the twelfth century the Sinhalese painter was capable of expressive and delicate line work, could give plasticity to his figures, and understood the principles of balanced composition. Noteworthy among the paintings in this temple is a group of celestial beings, forming a portion of a large scene, recently brought to light by the removal of a later coat of lime- wash. Among these is a figure of noble mien, about half life-size, standing in the tribhaňga posture and holding a flower in one hand. The pose and the facial expression of this figure take one's thoughts to the well- -known Bodhisattva in cave No. 1 at Ajantã. Here, as well as at Hiňdagala, one notices the technique of shading by means of lines. The centuries which followed the fall of the Polonnaruva kingdom in 12 13 .saw the jungle tide enveloping the cities and shrines of the previous age. New -cities were founded in other parts of the island but not on the same scale as before. Figure sculpture of the later period was of a formal and frigid character, though the decorative element in art continued to be of effective quality. The old school •of painting disappears. What takes its place is a folk art of which the pleasing colour schemes and decorative designs are the chief merits. Wood carving of good quality and ivory carvings of great delicacy and charm have been produced in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These and other arts of this late period are dealt with at length in Coomaraswamy 's Mediaval Sinhalese Art . 603</page><page sequence="17">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS 2ND JUNE I950 DISCUSSION Sir Harry Lindsay, K.C.I.E., C.B.E. (Chairman, Dominions and Colonies Section): I should like to ask one very elementary question concerning the large- size statues of the Buddha, one of which was, I believe, 40 feet high. Are all those large statues carved out of the rock background, or have they been brought from other places and erected there? Mr. Gray: I believe they are all carved from the rock. Certainly the largest ones must be. Mr. A. M. Livingstone, C.I.E. : At the beginning of the paper it was said that there was quite a lot of contact between Ceylon and southern India, and, on looking at the illustrations on the screen, there seemed to be some affinity between Sinhalese and Indian architecture, but very little, as far as I could see, between Sinhalese and Hindu sculpture. To us, Sinhalese sculpture, with its natural proportions, is much more pleasing than some of the Hindu sculpture with its rather exaggerated pro- portions. I was wondering whether there was anything to account for that, in view of this coming and going between Ceylon and India? One other small point struck me. All over the south of India you see the repre- sentation of the horse's head and figure. It may be that Sinhalese art was based on the Buddhist motif, but I did not see the horse's head coming in anywhere at all. One would have thought, as it is so general throughout southern India, that if there had been this continual contact between the mainland and Ceylon, there should be some trace of it. There may be more affinity in the painting ; but perhaps Mr. Gray could tell us why there should be this apparent lack of affinity in the art of the two territories, which were so closely related; and also indicate to us where, in fact, there may be an affinity which I have not noticed. Mr. Gray : In the first place, the illustrations of this lecture were specially chosen by Dr. Paranavitana to illustrate the Sinhalese element in the art of Ceylon, including two or three examples of Sinhalese art strikingly similar to the art of AmarãvatL I do not know quite what period the questioner was thinking of, but certainly at that time, in the third, fourth and fifth centuries, there was a very close connection indeed between the Buddhist art of Ceylon and the Buddhist art of India. In painting, the position is rather different, because it happens that we have paintings from Ceylon of a period in which the greater compositions in Indian art have almost completely disappeared. Medieval Indian painting is, unfortunately, very little known to us, the remains being exceedingly fragmentary and small. There is nothing, for instance, in the Indian peninsula to compare with the great wall paintings at Sïgiri. I have no doubt that if there were, there would be striking points of similarity to be noted. I am not quite sure that I understand to what the questioner was referring when he spoke of the better proportions of the sculpture in Ceylon; perhaps he would indicate what period or kind of Indian sculpture he was thinking of. Mr. Livingstone: Much of the Indian sculpture which I have seen appeared over-proportioned, with excessively long arms and thighs; the only illustration I noticed this evening that appeared to be Indian was the dancing figure in bronze, but that had not got the exaggerated proportions. Mr. Gray: The Nataräja figure is, of course, very similar indeed to the examples which we know to come from Madras, so much so that it is quite possible that it 604</page><page sequence="18">2ND JUNE 1950 GENERAL NOTES r. was actually made by a craftsman from India. I think that in all Buddhist art, with its emphasis on the mudrä, there tends to be exaggeration of the hands; they are represented on a larger scale than in nature. But that, I should have thought, was common also to the Buddhist figures of Ceylon. I do not myself see any great difference. Mr. T. Vimalananda: With regard to the four animals appearing in the moon- stone, which is peculiar to Ceylon - the bull, the lion, the horse and the elephant - Dr. Paranavitana referred to them as chasing one another, but it is very doubtful whether they are. A different explanation was given by Dr. Marshall for the capital of Asoka at Särnäth. Dr. Marshall referred to the lion as symbolizing the Buddha, Sãkyasiniha; the horse as the great renunciation; and the bull as Queen Mäyä riding in a kind of bullock cart, leaving Kapilarastu for her parents' palace. The elephant he suggested represented the dream of Queen Mäyä. Dr. Marshall also suggested that the geese appeared as ornaments of Asokan capitals. Mr. Gray: Yes, I think there is no doubt that all the elements in the decorations of moonstones are directly connected with Indian originals. I think you will have noticed that in the paper Dr. Paranavitana stressed the way in which the original Indian elements developed on their own in Ceylon at a later date, after they had disappeared in India itself. That, I think, is a case in point. The Chairman : If there are no more questions, it remains to me now to perform my most pleasant duty this evening, which is to propose a very hearty vote of thanks to both Dr. Paranavitana, for a most interesting paper, and Mr. Basil Gray, for reading it and answering our questions. Those of us who know the difficulty of pronouncing ancient Sinhalese names will have been struck by the clarity and accuracy of Mr. Gray's pronunciation. It showed me quite clearly how well he knows the subject of the paper written by Dr. Paranavitana ; and I am sure that Dr. Paranavitana could not have chosen a better person to deliver his lecture. We are most grateful to him for having undertaken this difficult task, and I am sure you will all join with me in passing a hearty vote of thanks to both of them. The vote of thanks was carried with acclamation ; and another having been accorded to the Chairman, the meeting terminated.</page></plain_text>
