DUE PROCESS, JURISDICTION OVER CORPORATIONS, AND THE COM- MERCE CLAUSE. -Various theories have been advanced to explain the basis of jurisdiction over foreign corporations under the due process</page><page sequence="2">NOTES Io63 clause, but these have been attempts to rationalize an existing practice, rather than doctrines which have moved the Supreme Court. The plain fact exists that jurisdiction has been exercised over foreign corporations " doing business " within a state.' Of the theories proposed, the most recent explains the jurisdiction as that of a state over those who have caused acts to be done within the state. This view, like the theory of implied consent,3 is in accord with orthodox beliefs as to corporate per- sonality.4 It is open, however, to two objections. First, it is difficult to see why a state has not jurisdiction thereunder as to causes of action arising out of the isolated acts of a corporation which the state might constitutionally forbid unless the corporation consented to jurisdiction. Under this theory there would seem to be no magic in acts sufficient to constitute " doing business," 5 yet, as the exponents of the theory admit,6 the law is otherwise 7 except as to dangerous acts. And secondly, this view does not explain those cases which permit suits against foreign corporations doing business within the state on causes arising out of foreign business.8 The theory consistently enunciated by several Jus- 1 See notes 8-I3, infra. As to what constitutes " doing business," see Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. v. Chatters, 49 Sup. Ct. 329, 330-31 (U. S. 1929); Notes (1929) 29 COL. L. REV. 187; (1923) 36 HARv. L. REV. 327. For an historical survey, see HENDERSON, POSITION OF FOREIGN CORPORATIONS IN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW (1918) C. 5. 2 See Scott, Jurisdiction Over Nonresident Motorists (1926) 39 HARV. L. REV. 563, 572 et seq.; CONFLICT OF LAWS RESTATEMENT (Am. L. Inst. 1926) ? 97. 3 This is the most venerable of the explanations. For an exposure of its fictitious basis, see HENDERSON, op. cit. supra note I, at 95; Scott, supra note 2, at 574. Furthermore, it seems incorrect to use actual consent by way of analogy and to say that a corporation doing business within the state will be treated as if it had con- sented, since a service reasonably calculated to give notice must be made in such cases. Consolidated, etc. Co. v. Muegge, 49 Sup. Ct. 17 (U. S. 1928) (applying Wuchter v. Pizzutti, 276 U. S. 13 (1928), to a corporation) ; see (1927) 4o HARV. L. REV. 904. 4 See note IO, infra. 5 The theory of acts done or caused to be done within a state (hereafter called the " act " theory), more fully stated, is that if a state may constitutionally prohibit acts unless the actor consents to jurisdiction as to causes of action arising out of such acts, such state may provide that the doing of those acts by a corporation shall subject the actor to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state. CONFLICT OF LAWS RESTATEMENT ?? 89, 90, 93. It would seem that if a state may thus conditionally forbid a corporation to do acts sufficient to constitute doing business, it may simi- larly forbid lesser acts. Cf. Bothwell v. Buckbee, Mears Co., 275 U. S. 274 (1927) - Palmetto Ins. Co. v. Conn., 272 U. S. 295 (1926); Note (1928) 4i HARV. L. REV. 390. 6 See Scott, supra note 2, at 579, n.39. 7 See note I3, infra. 8 In Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. v. Reynolds, 255 U. S. 565 (1921), the Supreme Court in a per curiam opinion affirmed a judgment against a foreign corporation based on notes payable outside the state. See Transcript of Record 20. The notes were also made, issued, and negotiated without the state. Reynolds v. Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry., 228 Mass. 584, 586 (1917). Service was made upon an agent of the corporation, not on a public official; the corporation had not consented to jurisdiction. Counsel for the defendant urged upon the court the decisions of Old Wayne Life Ass'n v. McDonough, 204 U. S. 8 (1907), and Simon v. Southern Ry., 236 U. S. 115 (1915), which reached an opposite result upon substantially similar facts, except that service was made upon a public official. See Brief for Plaintiff in Error 18-25. The lower court also, made its decision with knowledge of these two decisions. See Reynolds</page><page sequence="3">io64 HARVARD LAW REVIEW tices 9 of the Supreme Court is that foreign corporations which do busi- ness within the state are present 10 therein. It seems necessary, in order v. Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry., supra, at 588-90, ii7 N. E. at 913, 914-15. Professor Scott and the restaters of the conflict of laws in framing their theory to fit the Old Wayne and Simon cases seem to have overlooked the Reynolds decision. See Bullington, Jurisdiction Over Foreign Corporations (1928) 6 N. C. L. REV. 147, I6i. The Reynolds case is not unique; it was decided on the authority of St. Louis S. W. Ry. v. Alexander, 227 U. S. 218 (1913). There the cause of action was for non- performance of a contract to deliver goods within the state. The making of the contract and the shipment of the goods occurred outside the state and were uncon- nected with the business done within the state. Jurisdiction was upheld but without consideration of the Old Wayne case. Both the Reynolds and the Alexander cases were cited without disapproval in Davis v. Farmers Co-operative Co., 262 U. S. 312, 317-i8 (1923), and distinguished on the ground that the commerce objection was not raised in them. And see note i9, in!ra. This jurisdiction was commonly exer- cised by the court in earlier cases, though without analysis. Herndon-Carter Co. v. Norris &amp; Co., 224 U. S. 496 (1912) (cause arising out of business done abroad; see Transcript of Record 6i et seq.) ; Commercial, etc. Co. v. Davis, 213 U. S. 245 (1909) semble; Barrow S. S. Co. v. Kane, 170 U. S. I00 (i898); Railroad Co. v. Harris, I2 Wall. 65 (U. S. I870). New York has reached the same result. Tauza v. Susque- hanna Coal Co., 220 N. Y. 259, II5 N. E. 915 (1917) (per Cardozo, J.). See also Logan v. Bank of Scotland, [1904] 2 K. B. 495. The Old Wayne and Simon cases might be distinguished on the narrow ground that service on a state official who forwards notice is to be treated as differing from service on an agent of the corporation, since it is not the best method of noti- fication possible. See Osborne, " Arising Out of Business Done in the State " (1923) 7 MINN. L. REV. 380, 382, n.9; CONFLICT OF LAWS RESTATEMENT ? 8o(d) ; cf. Cahill, Jurisdiction Over Foreign Corporations (1917) 30 HARV. L. REV. 676, 694; Bullington, supra, at i6o. But see Fead, Jurisdiction Over Foreign Corporations (1926) 24 MIcH. L. REV. 633, 642; Scott, supra note 2, at 579, n.40; COMMENTA- RIES ON CONFLICT OF LAWS RESTATEMENT ? 97(C). Or they may be rested on the fact that the state officials were not required by the statutes to give notice to the corporations, and did not do so. Consolidated, etc. Co. v. Muegge, 49 Sup. Ct. I7 (U. S. 1928); see note 3, supra. But neither of these points were considered by the Court. If the Reynolds and Alexander cases be law, it is difficult to under- stand how the ratio decidendi of the Old Wayne and Simon cases can be upheld. See Morris &amp; Co. v. Skandinavia Ins. Co., U. S. Daily, May 15, 1929, at 636 (U. S. Sup. Ct.). But see Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. v. Chatters, 49 Sup. Ct. 329, 331 (U. S. I929); Robert Mitchell Furniture Co. v. Selden Breck Co., 257 U. S. 2I3 (I92I); Chipman, Ltd. v. Jeffery Co., 25, U. S. 373 (I920); cf. Note (I929) 42 HARV. L. REV. 676, 679, n.ig. 9 This theory is most frequently met with in the opinions written by Mr. Jus- tice Brandeis. See Bank of America v. Whitney, etc. Bank, 26i U. S. 171, 172 (1923); Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co. v. Curtis Brown Co., 260 U. S. 5i6, 517, 5i8 (1923); Philadelphia &amp; Reading Ry. v. McKibbin, 243 U. S. 264, 265 (1917). It has recently been stated by Mr. Justice Stone. See Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. v. Chatters, 49 Sup. Ct. 329, 33I (U. S. 1929). And at least two former members of the Court accepted this view. Day, J., in People's Tobacco Co. v. American Tobacco Co., 246 U. S. 79, 87 (i9i8); International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky, 234 U. S. 579, 589 (I9I4); St. Louis S. W. Ry. v. Alexander, 227 U. S. 2i8, 226 (i9io). McKenna, J., in Hunter v. Mutual Reserve, etc. Co., 2i8 U. S. 573, 584 (I9IO). 10 The traditional American doctrine has been that corporations cannot mi- grate beyond the state of incorporation. See Bank of Augusta v. Earle, I3 Pet. 5I9, 588 (U. S. I839). The theory of implied consent and that based on acts done or caused to be done within a state arose from earnest attempts to reconcile this orthodox concept with the fact of jurisdiction. It may be that only the most anthropomorphic mind will choose to regard a corporation, any more than a chose, as present anywhere. See Foley, Incorporation, Multiple Incorporation, and the Conflict of Laws (I929) 42 HARv. L. REV. 5I6, 526; Scott, supra note 2, at 574 et seq.; Magruder and Foster, Jurisdiction over Partnerships (I924) 37 HARV. L.</page><page sequence="4">NOTES io65 to explain the decisions, either to adopt this conception, or else to recog- nize that " doing business " is for corporations a basis of jurisdiction per se,11 equivalent to presence in the case of individuals. But the " act " theory is still needed to explain cases where jurisdiction is sus- tained in respect to causes of action arising out of former business, though the corporation has at the time of the suit ceased to do busi- ness; 12 and cases where the cause arose out of dangerous acts not con- stituting " doing business." 13 There seems to be no established category of jurisdiction which must not run the gauntlet of the commerce clause,14 although the effect of REV. 793, 826-27; GOODRICH, CONFLICT OF LAWS (I927) I49. But see HENDERSON, loc. cit. supra note I, especially at ioo; Bullington, supra note 8, at I52-53; Cahill, supra note 8, at 688-96. Similarly, to some minds the accepted conception of the "domicil" of a corporation is distasteful. See Francis, The Domicil of a Corporation (I929) 38 YALE L. J. 335. 11 See Francis, supra note io, at 350; Magruder and Foster, supra note io, at 827. 12 American Ry. Express Co. v. Royster Guano Co., 273 U. S. 274 (I927) Zendle v. Garfield Aniline Works, 29 F.(2d) 4I5 (D. N. J. I928). But cf. Conley v. Mathiesen Alkali Works, I90 U. S. 406 (I903). A case in which there was a fiat finding of " doing business " at the time of suit might more satisfactorily be supported on the same ground. Connecticut, etc. Ins. Co. v. Spratley, 172 U. S. 602 (i899). Other cases of the Spratley type may be rested on irrevocability of con- sent actually given. Mutual Reserve, etc. Ass'n v. Phelps, I90 U. S. I47 (1903) Mutual Reserve, etc. Co. v. Birch, 200 U. S. 6I2 (I905) see Hunter v. Mutual Reserve, etc. Co., 2I8 U. S. 573, 59I (IgIo); CONFLICT OF LAWS RESTATEMENT ? 96. 13 Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U. S. 352 (I927), (I927) 4I HARV. L. REV. 94. Though this case did not involve a corporation it would seem that its principle of jurisdiction for a tort resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle within the state by a non-resident must be applicable to corporations. In several cases juris- diction has been denied where the causes arose out of non-dangerous acts done within the state, where such acts were found not to constitute " doing business." James-Dickinson, etc. Co. v. Harry, 273 U. S. II9 (I927) (cause arose abroad; as to the acts done within the state, see Transcript of Record 3); Minnesota, etc. Ass'n v. Benn, 26i U. S. I40 (I923) (cause arose abroad); Rosenberg Bros. &amp; Co. v. Curtis Brown Co., 260 U. S. qi6 (I923); Toledo Rys., etc. Co. v. Hill, 244 U. S. 49 (1917) semble (see Transcript of Record I9, 2I). The "act" theory was not considered by the Court in any of these cases. Cf. Cannon Mfg. Co. v. Cudahy Packing Co., 267 U. S. 333 (I925); (I929) 42 HARV. L. REV. 955. It should also be noted that decisions under the Clayton Act may be based on the " act " theory. Section I2 provides that actions under it may be brought against a corporation in any district whereof it is an inhabitant and " also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business." 38 STAT. 736 (I9I4), I5 U. S. C. ? 22 (I926). This alternative, " transacts business," has been construed as giving jurisdiction based on acts less than are necessary to constitute " doing business " (the accepted interpretation of " found " in federal venue statutes). Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co., 273 U. S. 359 (I927). But cf. Lumiere v. Wilder, Inc., 26i U. S. I74 (I923). The result might be placed on the ground that the federal courts have jurisdiction over all defendants found within the United States. Cf. Chafee, Interstate Interpleader (I924) 33 YALE L. J. 685, 697, 720-2I; Bacon v. Federal Reserve Bank, 289 Fed. 5I3, 5I9 (E. D. Wash. I923). Under such a view the provisions of the act would concern venue and not jurisdiction. The same problem is raised by ? 6 of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. 36 STAT. 29I (I9IO), 45 U. S. C. ? 56 (I926); see Trapp v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R., 283 Fed. 655 (N. D. Ohio I922). 14 Actual consent may perhaps be an exception. See note 25, infra. And of course federal jurisdictional legislation is not restricted by the commerce clause. See Harris v. American Ry. Express Co., I2 F.(2d) 487, 488 (Ct. of App. D. C. I926) ; Gavit, Jurisdiction over Causes of Action against Interstate Carriers (I927) 3 IND. L. J. I30; see note I3, supra.</page><page sequence="5">i o66 HARVARD LAW REVIEW that clause on the jurisdiction of courts 15 over foreign corporations 16 has not, as yet, been definitively marked out by the Supreme Court. Michigan Central R. R. v. Mix 17 and Davis v. Farmers Co-operative Co."8 must be taken as holding that though the defendant corporation is doing business, there is no jurisdiction unless the commerce clause in addition to the due process clause is satisfied."9 The former decision supplies the additional information that a special appearance to contest jurisdiction, which can consistently with the requirements of due process be made a basis of jurisdiction,20 may not so be treated if the commerce clause is thereby violated. It seems to follow that the less well estab- lished " act " basis of jurisdiction is similarly limited.2' It has also 15 It may be that the commerce clause restricts the jurisdiction of state courts, so that collateral attack of a judgment violating it will be allowed in another state. See Atchison, etc. Ry. v. Wells, 265 U. S. IOI (I924); CONFLICT OF LAWS RESTATE- MENT ? 45, COMMENTARIES ? 43. On the other hand it may merely affect the competence of state courts. Usually only direct attack is possible if the objection goes to competency. See Note (I927) 40 HARV. L. REV. 766, 769. But see CON- FLICT OF LAWS RESTATEMENT ? 470(b). No case has, as yet, considered the point specifically. The Wells case 'may perhaps be rested on the local practice engen- dered by the rule of York v. Texas, I37 U. S. I5 (i8go). 16 It is believed that the principles hereinafter discussed in notes I7-26, infra, apply to jurisdiction over individuals as well as corporations. Cf. Kane v. New Jersey, 242 U. S. i6o (i9i6). 17 278 U. S. 492 (I929). A switchman, resident in Michigan and employed by the D railroad, a Michigan corporation, was killed in Michigan in the per- formance of his duties. *His wife moved to Missouri, was appointed adminis- tratrix, and brought suit in a Missouri state court. Service was made on D's agent for the solicitation of freight, which was the only form of business carried on by D in Missouri. D, appearing specially, petitioned to remove. This was denied by the state court. Thereupon D filed a transcript of the record in the federal court and moved to quash the summons. That court refused to pass on the motion and remanded the case to the state court. D, again appearing specially, there pressed the motion to quash. This was denied, partly on the ground that a petition to remove is equivalent to a general appearance under the Missouri law. D sought a writ of prohibition from the Supreme Court of Missouri. This was denied. On certiorari the United States Supreme Court reversed this decision on the ground that to permit the suit would burden interstate commerce. The Court ruled that a petition to remove could not be treated by the state court following a remanding as equivalent to a general appearance. The Court, in addition, refused to inquire into the local practice which, it was claimed, treated a motion to quash as a general appearance. 18 262 U. S. 3I2 (I923) ; cf. International Harv. Co. v. Kentucky, 234 U. S. 579 (I9I4). 19 The non-residence of the plaintiff seems of no importance under the due process clause. Barrow S. S. Co. v. Kane, 170 U. S. Ioo (i898). This is clearly the conflict of laws rule. See SCOTT, CAS. CIV. PROC. (09I5) 2n.; cf. note 26, infra. In the Davis case, the Court avoided determining whether the corporation was doing business, but in the Mix case this was said to have been there assumed. See Michigan Cent. R. R. v. Mix, 278 U. S. 492, 496 (I929). 20 York v. Texas, I37 U. S. I5 (i890). But see Blair, Constructive General Appearances and Due Process (I928) 23 ILL. L. REV. II9. 21 The jurisdiction of York v. Texas may be based upon presence or acts caused to be done. In the normal case, a suit in another state would be defended by attorney, therefore the basis must frequently be acts caused to be done. See Notes (I927) 4o HARv. L. REV. 766, 767, n.6; (I928) 4i HARV. L. REV. I055, IO57, n.I4. It should be noted that in York v. Texas there is an extension over the " act " theory as it is usually stated, since the cause of action clearly does not arise out of the acts upon which jurisdiction is founded. The jurisdiction sustained in Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U. S. 352 (I927), would</page><page sequence="6">NOTES i067 been held that property of a foreign corporation not doing business within the state may not be attached, nor debts owing to it garnished, to satisfy causes of action which arose outside the state from acts done abroad, if interstate commerce is burdened thereby.z2 Logically, it might even seem that the jurisdiction of a state of incorporation would be limited: to force a corporation doing no business within the state to defend causes of action which arose abroad out of acts done abroad, merely because the corporation is " domiciled " within the state, might well be a burden on interstate commerce. It is likely, however, that the Court would be moved by other considerations.23 And whether the commerce clause limits consensual jurisdiction,24 must depend on whether the right of immunity conferred by the clause is a personal privilege of the defendant, or founded on some public interest.25 In each case the degree of interference with interstate commerce must be weighed against the propriety of depriving the particular plaintiff of an established forum. If a defendant cannot show that it would be a lesser burden upon interstate commerce for it to be sued elsewhere, the problem will not arise. Where, however, the defendant has no established business in the state, it may be inconvenienced to defend any action there, though perhaps that circumstance should make no difference if it is incorporated there. Similarly, where the defendant is doing business within the state but the claim arises out of transac- tions in another state, the defendant may be inconvenienced in defend- ing such a suit because of the necessity of transporting witnesses. Where the defendant makes out a case of hardship, the burden must fall upon the plaintiff of showing some particular connection between undoubtedly be upheld under the commerce clause. Cf. Kane v. New Jersey, 242 U. S. i6o (i9i6). 22 Atchison, etc. Ry. v. Wells, 265 U. S. IOI (I924). 23 It may well be that fairness to a plaintiff demands that- there be at least one state where he is sure he can secure jurisdiction over the defendant. This con- sideration may, perhaps, justify any burden on commerce. Cf. note 26, infra. In Hoffman v. Foraker, 274 U. S. 2I (I927), a non-resident sued on a foreign cause arising out of business done in another state and was permitted to recover in a state where defendant was incorporated. But the defendant corporation was doing business in the state and the situation suggested by the text was not considered. 24 The jurisdiction of the state of " domicil " of a corporation may in certain cases be based upon actual consent. See, e.g., N. J. COMP. STAT. (Cum. Supp. I925) ? 47-28d(I), (2). In such cases the problem discussed in note 25, infra, will be raised. 25 It may be that the Supreme Court is using the commerce clause merely to lessen the personal inconveniences which past decisions under the due process clause have forced upon defendants. If so, voluntary consent, such as a power to confess judgment, is unhampered by the Constitution. " Consent " enforced upon entrance might perhaps be. treated as an unconstitutional condition. See Note (I929) 42 HARV. L. REv. 676, 679, n.i9. If, however, the commerce clause obstacle to suit is founded upon the public interest in unimpeded commerce be- tween the states, it is conceivable that even voluntary consent as a basis of juris- diction might be limited thereby. In the cases in which the commerce clause has been used to deny jurisdiction the defendant has been a railroad. But cf. Sioux Remedy Co. v. Cope, 235 U. S. I97 (1914). It may be that the public interest in the unimpeded service of public utilities is greater than in the unobstructed flow of ordinary commerce between the states. If so, it is conceivable that a public utility might be permitted to with- draw its consent, whereas a non-public service defendant would not be.</page><page sequence="7">i o68 HARVARD LAW REVIEW the forum he has chosen and the suit he brings.26 What will be a suffi- cient connection to subject the defendant to the jurisdiction of the court must vary with the degree of the burden imposed upon interstate commerce. 126 This is indicated in the Mix case, where the plaintiff had become a resident of the state of suit after the cause arose. The Court said, " For aught that appears her removal . . . was solely for the purpose of bringing the suit. . . ." 278 U. S. at 495. It may be that had Missouri been the plaintiff's former home, a different result would have been reached. A lower federal court has permitted recovery where the plaintiff was a resident of the forum at the time the cause arose. Griffin v. Seaboard, etc. Ry., 28 F.(2d) 998 (W. D. Mo. I928). Accord: Johnston v. Atlantic Coast Line Ry., I28 Misc. 82, 217 N. Y. Supp. 758 (I926); Davis v. Cleve- land, etc. Ry., 2I7 U. S. 157 (i910) semble. In St. Louis, etc. Ry. v. Taylor, 266 U. S. 200 (I924), recovery was allowed where the plaintiff was such a resident, and the cause, if in contract and perhaps if in tort, arose within the state. Accord: Maverick Mills v. Davis, 294 Fed. 404 (D. Mass. I923) (no tort in state); Lefebvre- Armistead Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., I42 Va. 800, I28 S. E. 244 (I925) (same) ; see (I928) 42 HARV. L. REV. I3I.
