<plain_text><page sequence="1">80 BULLETIN OF THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO A KAMAKURA BUDDHIST TRIPTYCH AVERY fine example of Japanese Buddhist painting of the Shingon sect during the Kama- kura period (1185-- 1335 A.D.) has re- cently been added to the Lucy Maud Buckingham Mem- orial Collection, and has been placed on view in Gallery H4. Fine paintings of this period, ecclesi- astical or otherwise, are very hard to find outside of Japan, as in most cases they are the property of temples, are Na- tional Treasures, or are contained in the great private collec- tions. This recent acquisition, a trip- tych representing Amida Buddha with the attendant Bod- hisattvas Kwannon and Seishi was for- merly in the collec- tion of Baron Kawa- saki, and was secured lastyearwhen a large part of his collection was sold at auction. Art played a very important part in the Shingon sect. Anesakit says that one of the sect's peculiar functions was to visualize "in pictures, statues and rites the symbolic or anthropomorphic 1Buddhist Art, Boston, 1915, 34- manifestations of Buddha and of the various deities which are his emana- tions," and again,2 "the worship of Di- vinity should not and cannot be dis- sociated from the cult of beauty, and art, therefore, must be an integral part of religion." In the elaborate rituals of the Shingon sect paintings such as these played an es- sential part. This triptych was doubtless used at fu- neral ceremonies, for during these cere- monies the Amida triad is invoked to " come and meet the soul in its passage from this world to the next." Here Kwannon and Seishi personify Mercy and Wisdom, the special characteristics of Amida, the Buddha of Boundless Light. In the central panel Amida stands in the position de- scribed by canon, his hands signifying, the left, charity (vara mudrd), and the raised right hand, protection (abhaya mudrd).3 2 Ibid, 42. 3 According to Miss Getty (The Gods of Northern Bud- dhism, Oxford, 1928, 42) Amida, in these mudrts, touches the thumb with the second or third fingers, while Shaka(Sakyamuni)does not.

MAYER TO THE SUMMER EXHIBITIONS In the right panel Kwannon (Avaloki- tesvara), deity of mercy and compassion, inclines toward the center, holding a lotus pedestal to be placed under the feet of the soul about to enter the Western Paradise. On the left Seishi (Mahasthamaprdpta), holding the palms of the hands together in the same attitude of prayer so often seen in the representations of Christian saints, prays for the soul on its journey. The whole effect of the triptych is com- passionate, gentle, and serene. There is great delicacy of delineation, and a perfect ability to express a mood. The background is so dark there is no way of telling the original color, but quite possibly it was a deep blue. Some white and pink is used in the flesh, and the features and arms, hands and feet are outlined in red, in very sensi- tive lines. What strikes one immediately, however, is the use of gold, for the general effect is that of gold figures silhouetted on black. The garments of all the figures are covered with patterns of fragile gold lines in great variety, formed, not with the brush, but cut out of gold leaf and fixed to the background with an adhesive. This unbelievably delicate work was very popu- lar in the Fujiwara and Kamakura eras and is known as kirikane (cut gold) work. At present its use has almost disappeared, but there is said to be one old man still living who can work with the delicacy and pre- cision of the old masters. The spidery fine- ness of the gold lines cannot be realized from the illustrations, but their web is so fine that the effect is subtle rather than overpowering.
