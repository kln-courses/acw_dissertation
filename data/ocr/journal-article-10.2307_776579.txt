<plain_text><page sequence="1">West African Farthworks The Western study and appreciation of Afri- can arts has historically, with few excep- tions, been narrowly confined to sculpture in wood and metal. In recent years the so-called decorative arts, in particular textiles and arti- cles of personal adornment, have been wel- comed into the fold of artistic respectability. More recently, furnishings and furniture have begun to receive serious consideration. Despite this broadening tendency, however, it was only last year, with the National Gallery of Art, Washington, exhibition of The Four Moments of the Sun, that an attempt was made to reintegrate these various art forms, hitherto divorced from their topologic context, into the aesthetic framework of space. With that exhi- bition, the door was opened to an entirely new perspective on the perception and definition of aesthetic expression in Africa.1 The traditional categories into which we have grouped the arts of Africa reflect our Western ethnocentric thinking mode; they re- flect neither the nature of African thought, philosophy, or religion nor the structure of African culture. The discrete and separate cat- egories that characterize so many aspects of Western culture and the alienation of the arts and of human beings from their environment -with its attendant de-symbolization and dep- rivation of meaning-have led us to impose artificial boundaries onto a cultural milieu in which meaningful forms function in a visual and aesthetic continuum that permeates all aspects of life. The choice of subject matter in the arts of Africa has, of course, also been dictated by what was readily available to the Western world: easily transportable, selectively chosen, com- mercially negotiable artifacts form the bulk and further reinforce the boundaries of our knowledge about art in Africa. The objects of study and the traditional categories that per- meate our thinking have thus prevented us 204 Art Journal from perceiving what is perhaps the most spectacular, and certainly the most pervasive, art form in the same West African savannah whence the more familiar sculptural traditions emanate: the earth itself, whose forms have been molded and shaped, meaningfully and expressively, into works of art and architecture. The arts of the earth, if we are to think of the arts as the material aspects of expressive cul- ture, provide us with an innovative framework in which to explore and redefine the nature of African art and aesthetics. The material, familial, social, and religious life of individuals and groups unfolds within the temporal frame of an enveloping symbolism that links past, present, and future and also within a spatial frame that links the cosmos to the most minute details of man's existence. Unlike highly technological societies in which spatial schemata are imposed by the built environment, in traditional West Africa it is the unstructured, unmodified natural markers in the topography itself that are imbued with purpose and meaning and that provide an atectonic construct for belief systems. Natural phenomena, rationalized into a theogony subtle and barely discernible to the Western eye, are highly significant to the African mind. The atectonic environment is endowed with sacrality by virtue of man's conceptual ability to impose a metaphoric quality upon it. All aspects of both the natural and man-built environment may and should be viewed in the context of their aesthetic expression. The earth itself is a primary building resource in the West African savannah. Trees are scarce, the technological tool kit is only minimally adequate for the exploitation of metal and stone, and few surfaces-other than textiles and leather-are available for two-dimensional representation. The earth also posesses a sacred quality. Like Mother Earth in other cultures, it is the source of well-being, of prosperity, of fertility, and of the continuity of life. It is the abode of the ancestors and the past, which validate the existence of the present and the anticipation of the future. Thus, all things formed and shaped from the earth carry, in- herent in them, an expressive quality and a symbolic message. The choice of illustrations in this article is a beginning attempt to demon- strate this thesis. They range in a continuum from the minimal primordial form which estab- lishes man's place in the universe to a geometric construction which, by bringing into play the mastery of earthen technologies, reorders the universe, defies the laws of gravity, and generates the conscious articulation of enclosed space. Sedentary agricultural cultures in the savan- nah belt depend for their subsistence-and indeed the very continuity of their existence- on grain crops such as millet. Should crop failure occur in any one season, the future would be doomed. Hence, the meanings at- tached to agricultural activities and their suc- cess are unmatched. Almost all ritual behavior, with its attendant generation of emotional in- volvement, is linked in one way or another to the earth's fertility. The first, almost impercep- tible distinction between the natural environ- ment and its cultural modification occurs in the softly rounded conical mounds from which the millet seedlings sprout (Fig. 1) A metonym or sign of prosperity integral with the landscape itself, these mounds communicate the most basic aspiration. Their form and quantity are a material measure in a value system structured by subsistence. The very proliferation of mounds embodies an underlying moral principle. Quan- tity in any form is a measure of well-being and efficacy. The more times a religious formula is repeated, the more amulets one wears on one's body, the more times a particular ritual act is performed, the more ancestors one can enumerate, and the more children one has,</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 Cultivatedfields of millet extending outfrom a village center in northern Ghana. the greater chances of success in any endeavor. Quantity, transformed into aesthetic preference, finds expression in the art form. The domical mound suggests the source for the visual metaphor ubiquitous in the savannah landscape: the ancestral earthen pillar. As a theological core, the ancestral pillar embodies the most sacred and heavily tabooed concepts of traditional African belief systems. Like any great work of art, the ancestral pillar is a formal image that allows for varied but related interpretations without losing its identity. As a multi-valenced, multi-vocal image it concretizes human aspiration. Cosmologies and myths of origin of the autochthonous cultures revolve around a family- or kin-based center in the earth below foot. They commence with the primordial emergence of anthropomorphic ancestors from that center. The invocation of the ancestors has as its goal the assurance of prosperity, fertility, and pro- creation. The ancestors are the focus of ritual behavior, of prayer and sacrifice, and their very presence is communicated by the earthen pillar or shrine: it is the "house" of one's ancestors. In many instances, these societies are patrilineal and patrilocal, so it is the male ancestors who provide the anthropomorphic basis for the iconography. Representation of female ancestors is more closely approximated by the lower, domical form of the millet mound. In the savannah world of generalized do- mains, where random phenomena of the natural topography provide benchmarks in space, man first elaborates on these phenomena, leaving his imprint of symbolic action by way of the single, hand-shaped earthen pillar. The inte- gration of natural symbols such as a tree or a unique rock outcropping with the primary consecration and sacralization of space finds classic expression in a Dogon altar to the Creator God Amma (Fig. 2) The deliberate creation of a meaningful, discrete image in the Fig. 2 Man-made ancestral earthen pillar combines with a tamarind tree and a granitic outcropping to mark the sacred site of a shrine to the Creator God, Amma, among theDogon in Mali. Fig. 3 The dry-season garden planting pattern on the outskirts of Timbucktu, Mali. natural environment is the abstract counterpart to the concrete, technical world of human behavior. In contrast to those cultures whose cosmol- ogies seem to spring solely from the earth below, the Dogon, in addition, appear to struc- ture their territorial organization in accordance with a cosmology that attributes the birth of their universe to a spiral unfolding from a center consisting of three ritual fields. These three fields are also symbolic of the three founding ancestors of the Dogon clans. Fields for cultivation are laid out in spiral fashion from a conceptual center. Thus, the direct correspondence between the physical reality of the grid-like, banked-earth, dry-season gar- dens which spiral around a water source (itself a life-giver in the hot, dry, barren savannah climate) and the myth of primordial creation in the Dogon cosmogony is clearly expressed as a system of earthworks on the landscape (Fig. 3). (Although outside the particular focus of this essay, it should be noted that this same spatial organization appears to lie at the base of the entire repertoire of Dogon envi- ronmental arts.) The sustenance of life from one harvest season to the next depends not only on a successful crop but also on a storage system which will preserve the crop until the next Fall 1982 205</page><page sequence="3">year's harvest. Granaries, as the built counter- part to the earth's fertility, are viewed as a living resource; they are imbued with a life force by means of sacrifice and libation cere- monies. Their structural success depends as much on technological skill as on supranatural will. A full granary is a pregnant granary, the quintessential man-made symbol of fertility (Fig. 4). Among some peoples, the granaries are located deep within the recess of the courtyard interior of family compounds. Often, when the granary is communal, it stands free, in full view, as a public statement of the well-being of the whole community. Formed entirely of earth, often constructed in a traditional coil-pottery technique, these granaries are a vernacular response to the functional requisites of hydraulic design. The tension rings which bind them are located at points of critical stress, and the resultant forms are in many ways an indigenous predecessor to the western world's concrete and steel liquid storage tanks. The granary is an anthropomorphic metaphor opposite to the male ancestral pillar and often has female attributes applied to it in bas-relief. The symbolic unity of male and female is eloquently expressed in earthen Tayaba com- pounds, where the ancestral pillar, marking the center of human habitation and the abode of the ancestors, rises vertically from its con- ceptual source to support the granary above it at a less sacred level of space (Fig. 5). All the arts of Africa are enveloped in magic and ritual, and their creators-whether they be sculptors, blacksmiths, weavers, leather- workers, potters, or masons-are perceived to have supranatural powers. Those who work the earth are no exception; they, too, are considered to be endowed with magical powers and to possess secrets that enable them to achieve results.

The geneologies that validate the existence of specialized building castes in West Africa rest on a mythical ancestral foundation. In order to guarantee the success of the built earthen form-whether it be a monument to the ances- tors, a housing compound, or a granary-a number of propitiatory rites must be addressed to those ancestors whose abode one is tamper- ing with. The sacrality of the earth envelops those who work with it. Given the sacred nature of the earth and the ancestral presence in it, it is logical that those who dig the earth are also the grave diggers and the builders of mausolea and tombs. It is also logical that the tombs of the ancestors would express, in crystallized fashion, the rules and meanings which underlie the aesthetic of earthworks. They indeed do provide us with a paradigm for the anthropomorphic nature of African belief systems, for the transformation from atectonic to tectonic space, and for the geometrization of space to which the presence of Islamic and Western thought contributed over time. Traditionally, earthen-built housing, albeit sacred, was amorphous and kinetic, reflecting, like a sociogram, changing relationships in the domestic cycle of an extended family. The residential compound was also viewed in the context of a biological model. Various spaces within it were associated with parts of the human body: stomach, head, feet, and repro- ductive organs. Burial took place within the sacred boundary of the compound, and the ancestral abode was designated by assigned space or earthen marker, either in the center of the bounded residential space or at critical thresholds between inner and outer, sacred and profane, space. Centuries of Islamic presence in the midst of traditional savannah societies effected a number of changes. Some, barely perceptible, were easily absorbed into the traditional aes- thetic, but others involved a radical reorgani- zation of concepts of space and the emergence of new imageries. The shifts in the cosmology of ancestral centers caused by the introduction of Mecca and the ka'ba contributed to the shift from atectonic to tectonic space, and the shift in the abode of the divine from the earth below to the heavens above introduced a new ideal: verticality. Changes in socio-political structures during the age of medieval African empire introduced new aspirations: permanence and monumentality. Two examples of funerary earth- works illustrate the nature of these changes (Figs. 6 and 7). In the first example, the human presence of the ancestors continues to be communicated visually by a combination of symbolic and figural representation. Male and female statu- ary, molded from the earth, approach the abstraction of their neighbors, the ancestral pillars. Apparently, once a particular physical representation comes to be associated with a particular social or aesthetic context, any char- acteristic part of the gestalt can be abstracted into a metaphor. The process is perhaps equiv- alent to the way in which one element of a costume or uniform normally associated with a particular rite or status is often used as both metaphor and metonym. The funerary sculpture has been relocated in space immediately out- side the compound entrance, not only creating a second center in space but also introducing a model for public display which emphasizes visual communication. The traditionally oval grave has been articulated into a square. The location of the elements of human sculpture at its corners and along the bounding edges expresses a new concept of space. The altar, consisting of a forked post supporting a cala- bash in which medicines are housed and over which libations are performed, is located pre- cisely on an axis bisecting the square. Natural, random space has, through conscious human act and presence, been replaced by geometric space. In plan, the space defined by the earthen tomb is analogous to the prescribed form of a sahn, the courtyard of an Islamic place of worship. The altar is located in precisely the same place as a mibrab, the niche which indicates the direction of Muslim prayer. It is also directly opposite the stomach of the corpse, for which Islam prescribes a north-south di- rection. The body of the deceased should always face east, towards Mecca. The second example, the mausoleum of Askia Muhamed, the most renowned ruler of the medieval Songhay empire, expresses the integration of the traditional conical form with a mathematical construct whose number rela- tionships symbolize an Islamic ideal. The mausoleum is located precisely in the center of the sahn of a mosque, a placement in many ways analogous to the location of a traditional Fall 1982207</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 8 The Friday mosque atBobo Dioulasso, Haute Volta. Fig. 9 Approach to the eastern, mihrabfaqade of the Great Mosque at Djenne, Mali. ancestral pillar in the center of a residential courtyard. The four faces of the pyramid, the seven ramp-like platforms, and the three levels of vertical space correspond to a set of primary number relationships in Islamic cosmology. The wooden toron, or pickets, which project in apparently haphazard fashion from the tomb's tapering faces, are in part structural and in part functional. But primarily, they are symbolic. Embedded in the earth, they serve both to concentrate the lines of cracking which result from changing climatic conditions and to act as scaffolding for the requisite periodic resur- facing in mud. More important, they are a symbol of wisdom. Used in association with the Bambara initiatory komo society specifically dealing with the acquisition of human knowl- edge, the toro symbolizes germination, prolif- eration, and rebirth. The name sutoro, one of the four mothers who represent knowledge and enlightenment, alludes to the funerary custom of burying a branch of the toro (fig) tree with the dead, to represent rebirth. For similar reasons, these toron are also found on the mihrab and minaret faces of all Western Sudanese mosques. How, precisely when, and by whom this monumental agglomeration was assembled re- mains in the realm of speculation. The historical record makes reference to the large number of skilled masons whom Askia Muhamed him- self controlled. Indeed, the marshalling of a labor force large enough to create such a monument became possible only with the emergence of a centralized polity and imperial ambition. As a quintessential statement of estab- lishment architecture, this mausoleum fulfilled, in the African manner, the advice of the well- known fourteenth-century Muslim scholar Ibn Khaldun on the importance of monumentality in the process of Islamization and urbanization. The Dogon myth of the origin of architecture refers to great "teeth" which were placed for protective purposes around dwellings, in imita- tion of the termite mounds which abound in the savannah. In reality, these teeth are the very same conical earthen pillars which symbolically mark ancestral presence and provide security for man's habitat. It is not the formal earthwork but the symbolic presence of the ancestors that offers protection, just as the military aspects of early fortification networks elsewhere were mar- ginal to their symbolic function in providing psychological security. Mythical ancestors of the founding Dogon lineages are represented by earthen finials which are attached to and project above facades. In like manner, the symbolic representation of the ancestors con- tinues to constitute the core of the Western Sudanese architectural style (Fig. 8). In the configuration of spectacular earthen pillars which bound the courtyard sahn of the mosque at Bobo Dioulasso, Haute Volta, the pagan ancestors have been transformed into a new metaphor for piety and wisdom in the Islamic context. A new moral order now affords pro- tection to its adherents, but the iconography derives from a visual heritage which continues to depend upon the traditional mold of shaping the earth into an ancestral presence. New building technologies in earthen con- struction, notably cast-brick and masonry tech- niques, were effective handmaidens for the introduction of a new architectural imagery whose rationale rested on mathematical and geometric principles of Euclidian space. In contrast to tamped-earth and coil-pottery tech- niques, a discrete geometric unit, a cast brick, opened up revolutionary possibilities for re- sisting the laws of gravity. Unlike the tensile qualities of wood, earth possesses only com- pressive strength. To lift the earth up from its natural resting place is to separate it from its context and to deprive it of its strength. The challenge of human aspiration in the vertical dimension recalls the conquering efforts of Antaeus in lifting Hercules from the source of his strength, Mother Earth herself. The skilled use of masonry techniques not only permitted man to master height but also provided a new template whereby infinite multiplication could regiment and geometricize the ancestral pillar into the mihrab of the Great Mosque at Djenne, Mali, at the turn of this century (Fig. 9). Symmetry, balance, and proportion, integrated into a new aesthetic, enabled the earthen an- cestor to stand straight and tall, "like a man." The quintessential achievement of verticality in traditional African earthworks, however, 208 ArtJournal</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 10 Earthen minaret of the mosque atAgades, Niger. Fig. 11 Domed ceiling structure of the Imam's reception hall at Filingue, Niger. required the structural integration of wooden tensile members for its realization (Fig. 10). The minaret of the mosque at Agades, Niger, built well over a century ago, depends for its height on the combined use of earth and timber. The structural frame for the watch- tower-like pinnacle consists of an internal system of split palm timbers which spiral in step formation to create the seven levels of Islamic cosmological space. Earth and timber work together structurally, transforming the symbol of ancestry into a tapering, four-sided prism which rises above the topography of the natural domain in defiance of the laws of gravity. The ultimate mastery of enclosed space also required the integration of tensile members into the traditional earthworks (Fig. 11). Domed interior spaces of Central Sudanese mosques, reception chambers, and entrance halls depend upon the grid armature of a magic square spatial format. Enveloped in earth, this vegetal armature provides the resist- ance to horizontal stresses and the forces of gravity which traditional earthworks lack struc- turally. The creator-occupants of the nomadic Tuareg, Songhay, and Fulbe mat-frame tents which were the source for these subsequent, earthen-enveloped armatures were and are women. The female presence, requisite to the continuity of life, continues to be manifest in much the same way as it is in the granaries. Although the earthen envelope is applied by men, the final act which marks completion in the creation of these enclosed spaces is the insertion of ceramic plates at the ribbed inter- sections of the dome by women. In attempting to trace a continuum in which the symmetries (and asymmetries) of anthro- pomorphic space and the human body interface with topological space through the earthwork medium, we have presumed, along with many others, that man's existence is dependent upon the establishment of meaningful, coherent, en- vironmental images in space. In making this presumption, however, the absence of perma- nence as a requisite to existence in West Africa merits a particular caveat. Unmodified, earth is subject to the vicissitudes of climate. Unlike those arts of the earth created out of stone or man-modified materials, the earthen art form in Africa requires persistent human involvement for its formal continuity. Hence, such earth- works possess both a timeless and a kinetic quality. Attended by human agency, they are subject to continual change through the ritual acts of countless sequential and often anony- mous contributors. Unattended, they erode and crumble back to nature, leaving behind them only the remains of vaguely defined ar- chaeological tumuli as testimony to the tran- scendental existence of the human presence on this earth.
