<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cross species applicability of psychiatric diagnosis and treatment Sir,?Readers of Dr Linda R Montague's sensi? tive account of her rehabilitation of a depressed cat1 may be interested to know that the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders in dogs and cats now form an established branch of veterinary medicine, taught at both postgraduate and, in some veterinary schools, undergraduate level. Al? though they are more commonly termed be? havioural rather than psychiatric problems, they respond to a similar range of treatments: psycho tropic drugs, behaviour modification, and environ? mental management?although not, of course, psychotherapy.2 i Dr Montague implies that similar symptoms in humans and other species point to similar diagnoses. Sometimes this is indeed the case: cats and dogs can suffer from monosymptomatic phobias which, as in human beings, respond well to systematic desensitisation. More often, however, there is no parallel. Similar symptoms may be produced by different conditions?for example, a dog showing sudden, unpredictable aggression towards a family member is unlikely to be psy? chotic or to be abusing drugs. Such an attack is usually the result of its instinctive drive to be top of what it perceives to be the dominance hierarchy in the household. Conversely, a similar disorder may give rise to different symptoms. In dogs separation anxiety may be manifested by destructiveness, urination, or defecation in the owner's absence. Owners who do not realise this may interpret the dog's actions as naughtiness or a desire for revenge: they may punish the dog, thus setting up a vicious circle of increased stress and anxiety. A more widespread recognition of the existence of psychiatric syndromes in species other than humans is to be welcomed, but an unquestioning, anthropomorphic application of human psychiatry to other species can be harmfully misleading.
