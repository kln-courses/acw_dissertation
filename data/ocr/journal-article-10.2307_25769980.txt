<plain_text><page sequence="1">Max Ernst in Arizona Myth, mimesis, and the hysterical landscape SAMANTHA KAVKY Max Ernst arrived in New York on July 14, 1941, one of the many European artists seeking asylum in America during World War II.1 Visual documentation of this artistic exodus survives in several group photographs such as the group portrait taken at Peggy Guggenheim's New York home in 1941 (fig. 1). Ernst sits farthest left in the center row, his son Jimmy and Guggenheim behind him. Such group photos support the image of 1940s New York as an artistic melting pot in which oppositional strands of European modernism merge and are then transformed by young American artists into Abstract Expressionism. The melting pot myth elides the very real dislocation and alienation of these artists; a more suitable metaphor might be Ernst's definition of Surrealist collage as "the fortuitous encounter upon a non-suitable plane of mutually distant realities."2 This definition characterizes the Guggenheim photo in which artists representing antithetical movements sit side by side to form a community based on circumstance rather than affinity. If, as their fellow refugee anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss later wrote, "mythical thought always progresses from the awareness of oppositions toward their resolution," this photograph clearly partakes in historical myth making.3 Besides the forced juxtaposition of the European artists, the partial inclusion of Ernst's kachina doll at the far right indexes the cultural alienation, geographic dislocation, and mythic potential of the image. Ernst and his Surrealist colleagues shared a fascination with myth, and its centrality to their thought expanded noticeably during their years of exile in America. In this article I explore the myth-making strategies of Ernst as he struggled to adapt to a new environment and establish himself in America. Marshaling his impressive knowledge of psychoanalysis and contemporary anthropology and cultivating an avid interest in Native American art and culture, Ernst, upon his arrival in America, adopted the persona of a Native American shaman.4 As he developed this role, it characterized not only his public face, but also his work and life in his new surroundings. During the five years Ernst lived in New York City, he visited the American Southwest in 1941 with Peggy Guggenheim and again in the summer of 1943 with American painter Dorothea Tanning.5 In contradiction to I thank Elizabeth Legge, Christine Poggi, and Oliver Shell for their critical feedback and encouragement.

Ernst's adoption of cherished American archetypes, both the mystical native and the independent pioneer, serves to defy his status as a stateless refugee. As a German who fought in World War I, Ernst had been living illegally in France since 1922. In 1939 he was incarcerated as an enemy alien before escaping and receiving asylum in America, only to find himself again labeled as an enemy alien when America entered the war.9 By leaving the "melting pot" of New York and going west, Ernst staked his own claim to Americanness. For Ernst and his Surrealist colleagues, Native American art emerged from a universal "primitivism" that transcended national, racial, and ethnic boundaries.10 Aboriginal culture, authentically American and universally "primitive," provided the mythic language to "naturalize" Ernst's alien status.11 His engagement with Native American culture was not limited to collecting or formal borrowing. Ernst's shamanist persona facilitated a psychological reciprocity with the landscape of the American West. In this paper, I argue that Ernst appropriated the shaman's mythic ability to identify with the natural environment through mimetic performance, and that he conceived of this mimetic power as an alternative to the European artistic tradition of illusionistic reproduction and to western attitudes of mastery and control over the natural world. The power of mimesis to destabilize traditional hierarchies of self and other has been explored by Michael Taussig in his 1993 study of the dynamics of the mimetic faculty within the western history 9.

Taussig defines the mimetic faculty as "the nature that culture uses to create second nature, the faculty to copy, imitate, make models, explore difference, yield into and become Other."12 This functional aspect of mimesis resonates in Ernst's work not only in America, but also throughout his career. Totemic landscapes The Surrealists' belief in the therapeutic efficacy of myth owed a debt to the writings of Sigmund Freud, who revived ancient mythologies by awarding them modern psychological significance. Freud predicated his 1913 work Totem and Taboo on the atavistic presence of totemism within the modern unconscious and its recurring manifestations in myth and religion. During the late 1920s Ernst used this text to create his own totem, Loplop, a bird-like creature modeled on Freud's totem father.13 The lingering influence of Freud's work and enthusiasm for Native American art, particularly that of the Northwest Coast, informs many of the first landscapes Ernst paints in America. Obvious iconic and formal evocations of totemism infuse paintings such as Totem and Taboo and Day and Night, produced in 1941,14 These totemic elements reference the landscape and native culture of Ernst's new home, while revisiting themes central to his previous oeuvre. Emphasizing continuity, Ernst creates a body of work meant to transcend the dislocations and traumas of his recent history. He mythologizes his move to Arizona, imbuing it with psychic determinacy through an incident of "objective chance" and representing it through the apocalyptic vision of Europe after the Rain II (fig. 3). According to his son Jimmy, Ernst first set eyes on the landscape around Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1941, during a cross-country trip. Jimmy recalls: On a late afternoon we got out of the car to watch a gigantic rattlesnake crossing U.S. 66 just outside of Flagstaff, Arizona. As Max looked up at nearby San Francisco Peak, he blanched visibly, his face muscles tightened. [.. .] He was staring at the very same fantastic landscape that he had repeatedly painted in Ardeche, France, not very long ago, without knowing of its actual existence. [. ..] That one look was to change the future of his life in America.15 While certainly apocryphal, Jimmy's account perpetuates the myth of the psychological relationship that his father sought to establish with the American Southwestern landscape. Ernst experiences a moment of deja vu or Surrealist "objective chance," a concept theorized by Andre Breton in the 1930s to describe an event that takes on dramatic psychological significance by corresponding to, and thus conferring meaning on, a previous sign.16 Jimmy interprets Ernst's chance encounter as the rediscovery of a landscape already familiar through representation. In this scenario, both physical and painted landscapes serve as a simulacrum, exterior signs of the artist's interior compulsion.17 In truth, the similarity between Ernst's French landscapes of 1940 and American landscapes of 1941 is striking. Europe after the Rain II depicts the transformation of old to new world within one canvas, mapping Ernst's historical and mythological journey from Europe to America. Although he began the work before he fled France, he did not complete it until after his first visit to Arizona. He acknowledges this by inscribing the dates 1940-1942 on the canvas.

Is it primeval or post apocalyptic? Myth or science-fiction? The preposition "after" provides little help, since aside from affirming the image's place within a larger narrative, it still allows for three possible temporal readings: It rained, is raining, or will rain in Europe; this is what it looked/looks/will look like afterwards. Ernst adds a second temporal locator in the form of the roman numeral II, revealing the existence of Europe after the Rain /, created in 1933-1934. Considered together, allusions to World Wars I and II become unavoidable. Europe after the Rain I resembles a topographical map embellished with dotted lines marking travel routes or military strategies and as such, points to the specific characteristics of World War I: aerial reconnaissance, the lines of the Western front. The second Europe after the Rain shifts the viewer's perspective by ninety degrees, from the modernist vision of the aviator back to a traditional landscape orientation, more suggestive of the epic narrative of the refugee's flight. Contradictory indicators of timelessness and duration infuse Europe after the Rain II. The painting displays the process of its production on its surface and unfolds slowly for the viewer. Added to the many figurative signs of duration?erosion, calcification, architectural ruins, organic overgrowth?the vast amount of minutia demands a prolonged visual exploration leading to the discovery and recognition of apparently animate forms. The viewing experience echoes Ernst's method of creation, repeated in his discovery and recognition of the Southwestern landscape through objective chance. Ernst's decalcomania technique literally objectifies chance through the discovery of imagery in the random application of various colors across a canvas. After applying paint, Ernst either folds the canvas or presses it with a glass plate or a sheet of paper in order to generate a richly textured ground.18 This ground offers Ernst a receptive screen for the projection of his imaginative visions, hallucinations motivated by his desires and obsessions. The automatic aspects of the technique align it with his previous use of frottage and grattage, visual parallels to Surrealist automatic writing.19 Seeking to tap into the reservoir of his unconscious, Ernst consciously models his techniques on Freudian psychoanalytic theory. As he fixes his visions, covering over certain areas of the canvas, emphasizing and embellishing others, his creative process forms an analogy to the secondary revision at play in the recall of dreams. While the canvases created by this method might suggest actual landscapes, they emerge literally from a 18. Ernst demonstrates his decalcomania technique in Simone Arbois, "UneVisite a Max Ernst/' Paru 59 (April 1950):17-21. It was invented by Oscar Dominguez in 1935. 19.

Ernst's exploration of this technique in the landscapes before and after his journey to America accounts for much of their similarity. Decalcomania invites the viewer to share in the process of discovery. In the rock formations and vegetation, the viewer encounters the raw texture of the pressed paint and watches while faces and figures gradually emerge. In Europe after the Rain II, the viewer's attention also travels laterally across the horizontal canvas, as the leftward gaze of the figures encourages a right to left reading. The viewer travels with Ernst from 1940 to 1942, from the flood of Europe to the desert of Arizona. Most likely Ernst painted the left side of the canvas after his trip to the American West. This side differs markedly from the textured ground on the right, or east of the canvas. The right side consists of cooler hues and more chaotic textures. It appears damp, murky, and vegetal, as if a covering of moss and lichens had accumulated on rain-soaked wood. By contrast, the left of the canvas looks arid and rocky. The tones are warmer, containing golds and reds, the textures stratified and more organized, although evoking coral as much as desert rock. In Europe after the Rain II, multiple indicators of time expand and contract in a structural analogy to the Freudian unconscious. Perceived time collapses within a synchronic structure that includes the mythological past, historical present, and prophetic future. The title recalls the biblical flood, but the imagery evokes the classical myth of the Rape ofEuropa. On the European side of the canvas, at the center right, a ruined classical temple engulfs a massive bull and a woman's nude torso in rubble. Ernst superimposes biblical and mythological narratives in a process akin to Freudian condensation and displacement. Europe ravaged by the flood suggests Europa ravaged by the bull Zeus. The artist buries the aggressor, the god/bull, under ruins, as the myth itself lies buried in the layers of his unconscious. The survivor of this ruin, an imposing and regal bird-headed man, stands over the crushed bull. This figure can be identified as Loplop, the anthropomorphic avian creature that appears frequently throughout Ernst's oeuvre. In another article, I have identified Loplop as a totem figure based on Ernst's reading of Freud's Totem and Taboo. Freud defines a clan's totem as an animal protector revered as a primal ancestor or father.20 He argues that the relation of totemism to fundamental taboos such as patricide and incest hinges on the primal murder of the father by a horde of brothers over sexual access to the clan women. Collective guilt deifies the murdered father and establishes the resulting interdictions. As the artist's totem, Loplop originates in a symbolic family romance. He functions as the symptom of an oedipal rivalry, signifying the destructive, and destroyed, patriarchal figure. Loplop's companion in Ernst's psychological landscape, a female character referred to as "Perturbation, my sister," accompanies him in the painted landscape as well. These survivors rise out of the ruins of Europe and look towards the west. They function as both victims and potential castrators of patriarchal power. Ernst superimposes Freud's analysis of totemism upon biblical and classical myths of violently destructive father gods. The victims in this image are the sons and daughters of Europe, but also the Fatherland. In raping Europa, the father has in a sense raped himself, leaving nothing but a wreckage of cultural ruins. This abbreviated analysis of a complex image offers some sense of the extent to which Ernst projects his psychic life onto his landscapes. Europe after the Rain II presents differing visualizations of temporality; the measurable past of Ernst's personal history, from Europe in 1940 to America in 1942, and the unmeasurable, ever-present of his psyche, where the contradictions between multiple indicators can be suspended. The image frames history?not only Ernst's voyage from Old World to New, but also his trip across America and his experience of "objective chance" while in Arizona, and transforms these events into myth. Ernst's seamless translation of self and art from one world to another depends on the relationship, theorized by Freud as well as many others, between modern psychology and "primitive" magic. Ernst's supposed psychic anticipation of the Arizona landscape casts him in the role of a visionary seer, magician, or shaman, possibly represented by the bearded man who emerges from the upper-left rock formation and gazes back into the painting. Playing Indian Charles Henry Ford's View magazine, which published Soby's photograph, "Max Among Some of His Favorite Dolls," functioned as the first literary vehicle for the Surrealists in America and was instrumental in presenting the displaced Europeans to their new public. The Max Ernst issue includes photographs of the artist; reproductions of his works; as well as works by 20. Sigmund Freud, Totem and Taboo (1913), trans.

E., As told by himself," in a collaborative effort to introduce Ernst as a magician.21 In Breton's essay, "The Legendary Life of Max Ernst, preceded by a brief discussion on the need for a new myth," he compares Ernst to fellow Cologne native and noted alchemist, "the arch-sorcerer himself, the great Cornelius Agrippa."22 In a painting by Leonora Carrington, Max Ernst, the Bird Superior, a shaman strides across an ice floe in a fish tailed bird costume. The alternation between the roles of alchemist and shaman, evident throughout the journal, enacts another elision of Old World and New. Soby's photograph shares a page with a photograph taken by Berenice Abbott of Ernst sitting in an elaborately carved high-backed chair before a latticed window in Guggenheim's apartment. The dramatic lighting and dominant cross formed by the window conspire to picture Ernst as a Gothic mystic. Juxtaposed with the image of Ernst as a Native American shaman, we are led to believe that his visionary capacities transcend time and place. Ernst's literary contribution to the issue ranks as one of the most entertainingly fictitious autobiographical accounts offered by an artist. It begins: "The 2nd of April (1891) at 9:45 a.m. Max Ernst had his first contact with the sensible world, when he came out of the egg which his mother had laid in an eagle's nest and which the bird had brooded for several years."23 Evan Maurer has convincingly argued that Ernst modeled this autobiography on traditional elements of the shaman's early calling and initiation.24 He posits Ernst's awareness of a tradition in which an eagle fathered the first shaman, making the eagle the totemic ancestor of all shamans. It is also possible that Ernst was influenced by the Sun Chief \n which Don Talayesva, a member of the Sun Clan, has an eagle totem. In any case, Ernst transforms his totem Loplop into an eagle in his American autobiography, retaining its role as tribal ancestor and advisor. In the last line of his autobiography he concludes: "Now and then he consulted the eagle who had hatched the egg of his prenatal life. You may find the bird's advices in his work (1941). The bird followed the plane which brought Max to this country on the 14th of July and built his nest in a cloud on the East River." An essential component of the shaman's life is his initiation journey into the world of spirits and inner vision. Ernst's text follows this narrative structure by presenting his own life as a series of initiations including "First contact with nothingness," "First contact with hallucination," and "First contact with occult, magic and witchcraft powers." Other transformative events in shamanistic mythology may include entry into the forest, hallucinations, and, most significantly, a spiritual death and rebirth in which the shaman leaves his previous life and returns as a magician. Regarding his experience as a solider in World War I, Ernst writes: "Max Ernst died the 1 st of August 1914. He resuscitated the 11 th of November 1918 as a young man aspiring to become a magician and to find the myth of his time." While the childhood hallucinations, the forests and birds appear in his 1937 text "Au-dela de la peinture," the avian birth, series of initiations, death and rebirth, the eagle, and the references to myth are additions specific to the American text.25 Ernst significantly altered his constructed autobiography, adjusting his previous psychoanalytic model and superimposing the shaman's journey as a frame for the interpretation of his childhood memories and experiences. Ernst bestows significant value on childhood in his writings, images, and personality, even referring to his artistic methods as "child's play."26 It is worth noting that the caption accompanying Soby's photograph of Ernst and his kachinas defines them as dolls, and although they are ritual objects, their original function was to instruct children in religious culture. One could argue that Ernst's collecting instigates his own initiation, ostensibly into shamanism or Native American culture, 21. Stokes, "Magus in New York" (see note 4). 22.

This is not simply an image of a grown man playing with dolls or playing dress-up, but playing Indian. In his 1998 study Playing Indian, Philip J. Deloria offers a sociohistorical analysis of this popular American activity, demonstrating its recurring role in American identity construction. During the early twentieth century, Indian youth groups formed as a buffer against growing urbanization and emigration, celebrated the Indian as a natural and authentic American type.27 Recapitulation theorists located children and Indians on a shared stage of cultural development. Ernst, who had played Indian as a child in Germany, tapped into a powerful means to subvert his foreign ness.28 Central to Deloria's discussion of "playing Indian" is the concept of mimesis, not only as a factor in the non-native's imitation of the native, but as that aspect of native experience that the non-native desires: Primitives, imagined as being in close contact with nature, were thought to be able to mime the natural world more accurately than moderns. In their rites, celebrants did more than merely imitate in an offhand way. Their archaic mimetic skills were powerful and allowed them to become something Other?animals, gods, natural forces. Primitivist Indian play, grounded in ethnographic detail, resuscitated archaic imitational skills that were the special province of children. Children imitated the meanings locked into Indianness, one of which was the idea that a person could make significant connections with the world by mimicking it.29 Ernst's role-playing entails both a childhood regression and an appropriation of the awe-inspiring power of physical mimicry held by the Native American shaman. While in New York, Ernst prepared for his role by actively collecting and studying Native American art and culture. He joined Breton and Levi-Strauss in frequenting the Museum of American Indians on 155th Street and Julius Carlebach's shop on 3rd Avenue.30 He even purchased a six-foot Kwakiutl house pole, which traveled with him to Sedona and eventually back to France.31 However, his real performance took place on location in Sedona. In photograph after photograph, many taken by Lee Miller in 1946, Ernst enacts his new American identity. In some photographs he poses bare-chested and wild-haired with a native blanket over one arm, embedded in the landscape as if one with his surroundings (fig. 4). In others he even dons the ritual mask of a kachina spirit (fig. 5). Ernst attempted to live a native existence by acting it, surrounding his house with totemic objects and engaging in mimetic performance. Ironically, Ernst embraces the alterity of the Native American shaman to eclipse his "otherness" as a German. The nymph Echo Ernst's interest in Native American art, his role-playing as shaman, and his totemic landscapes obviously appear as direct responses to exile in America and significant departures from his previous work. Yet, as I have demonstrated, there are many strands of continuity, technical as well as thematic, between his previous art and work produced in America. One of the most prevalent and significant is the central role played by mimesis, which as a recurring theme, acts as one of several unifying concepts subtending Ernst's entire, highly diverse oeuvre. One could argue that mimetic performance and the desire for alterity function as integral aspects of the Surrealist enterprise from its inception. By tracing Ernst's mimetic imagery back to an earlier fascination with Freudian hysteria, I hope to position his American works within this broader interpretative context and also touch on the value of mimesis within Surrealist aesthetic philosophy. In their practice of automatic writing, the Surrealists sought to facilitate the ability of the conscious mind to mimic the workings of the unconscious. In Immaculate Conception of 1930, Breton and Paul Eluard perform psychic alterity as they simulate various mental illnesses through automatic writing. Among the range of mental disorders the Surrealists explored, hysteria received special interest, not only for its erotic subtext, but also because it epitomized the mimetic faculty. In general, the diagnosis of hysteria in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries resulted from the presence of a range of physical symptoms with no clear organic cause. The hysteric convincingly simulated, and truly suffered from, various imaginary ailments, confounding the distinctions 27. Philip J.

They sketch its history from antiquity to the present, lauding its protean defiance of easy categorization. They conclude by offering their own definition of hysteria, challenging its status as a pathological condition and claiming it as "a supreme means of expression/'34 In fact, Breton and Aragon suggest that hysteria manifests as a means to resist the very authority that attempts to define and cure it. Charcot, working in a positivist scientific tradition, viewed hysteria as a neurological disorder and attempted to disassociate it from its traditional association with 32.

For example, in his 1934 collage novel Une Semaine de bonte, he concludes a series of images featuring the engraved illustrations of Charcot's hysterical patients in "attitudes passionelles," with an image of a hysterical woman freed from her clinical context (fig. 6).39 Here, Ernst aptly expresses Breton's dictate that: "Beauty will be convulsive or will not be."40 In a psychoanalytic Figure 6.

For Ernst, these cultural figures, both engendered out of the trauma of war, are profoundly related in their presumed access to the unconscious and their shared talent for mimicry. The identifications made by Freud, and many early twentieth-century anthropologists, between modern mental illness and so-called primitive mentalities, offered Ernst a means to translate the Freudian-influenced iconography and formal methods of the 1920s and 1930s into a new thematic of shamanism and Native American myth. Ernst's close contact with Levi-Strauss during the early 1940s might have functioned as a catalyst. In Structural Anthropology, Levi-Strauss suggests that psychoanalysis constitutes a modern form of shamanism, both defined as therapeutic techniques invested in the interpretation of dreams and the articulation of myths.42 He even compares a shaman's treatment of a woman in difficult childbirth with the psychoanalyst's talking cure in the treatment of female hysterics. For Ernst, the shaman combines the roles of the hysteric and the analyst, because like the hysteric, the shaman displaces his ego through mimicry. By identifying himself with hysteria and shamanism, Ernst hoped to gain access to his own unconscious, or at least, authentically to mimic its workings through his art. While Ernst commences "playing Indian," his fellow Surrealist refugee, Breton, invents a new myth also based on mimesis. In June of 1942 Breton published "The Prolegomena to a Third Manifesto of Surrealism, or Else" in the first issue of the Surrealist journal VW43 Breton attempts to decenter human activity by proposing a new myth, that of "The Great Invisibles." He writes: "Man is perhaps not the center, the focus of the universe. One may go so far as to believe that there exist above him, on the animal level, beings whose behavior is as alien to him as his own must be to the may-fly or the whale/' Their invisibility would stem from a "type of camouflage which," he continues, "no matter how one imagines it, becomes plausible when one considers the theory of form and what has been discovered about mimetic animals." Breton's reference to mimetic animals traces his ideas directly back to a text by Roger Caillois, titled "Mimetisme et psychasthenie legendaire," published in the journal /Vf/nofaur in 1935.44 In this text, Caillois posits a fundamental correspondence between the biological camouflage of certain insects, animistic magic, and modern psychosis (albeit psychasthenia, rather than hysteria).45 He interprets psychasthenia or neurasthenia as a spatial confusion affecting the distinction between an individual and the surrounding environment that results in a type of dissolution, or loss of self. As opposed to an instinct for conservation, he terms this opposing tendency an "instinct of abandon" or "the inertia of the vital spirit."46 As a means of camouflage or assimilation, Breton's myth resonates as the wish fulfillment of the soldier or displaced refugee; as the desire for ego dissolution and inertia, it suggests a more traumatic disruption of psychic identity. The mimetic insects and foliage of Ernst's jungle paintings such as the Joy of Life or The Nymph Echo from 1936 appear to be direct responses to Caillois's 1935 text (fig. 7). In Ernst's jungles, insects imitate leaves in a mimetic confusion that wreaks havoc with biological order. Caillois rejects scientific explanations of utility, arguing that biological camouflage functions not as a survival instinct, but as an excess of nature. He offers evidence that mimetic duplication makes an animal more desirable for certain predators rather than less. Ernst's jungles indulge in this luxury of mimetic excess with no assurance of safety. However, he diverges from Caillois in one respect: Caillois argues that natural 129-146; "Surrealist as Religious Visionary: Max Ernst's Reve D'une Petite Fille Qui Voulut EntrerAu Carmel (1930)/' in The Fantastic in World Literature and the Arts, ed.

"The modern version of shamanistic technique called psychoanalysis thus derives its specific characteristics from the fact that in industrial civilization there is no longer any room for mythical time, except within man himself... psychoanalysis can draw confirmation of its validity,... by comparing its methods and goals with those of its precursors, the shamans and sorcerers," Levi-Strauss (see note 3), p. 204. Questioned if he and Ernst ever discussed shamanism or psychoanalysis, Levi-Strauss answered in the negative, but wrote that their conversations focused on topics related to American ethnology and American art.

Animals mimic plants, the animate pretending to be inanimate, in a loss of life that owes a debt to Freud's concept of the death drive. Ernst allows for more variation, depicting a reciprocal mimicry implying the ability to harness the opposite force, Eros, or the pleasure principle, as indicated in his title, The Joy of Life. Ernst names several of his mimetic orgies The Nymph Echo, the quintessential mimic who appears in Ovid's Metamorphoses. She also appears as an allegorical figure of nature in Ernst's autobiographic sketch, "Identite Instantanee," published in 1937. Describing the inherent contradictions of his personality, Ernst states: Regarding "nature" for example, one may discern in him two attitudes, in appearance irreconcilable: that of the god Ran and the man Rapou who possesses all the mysteries and realizes the playful pleasure in his union with her ("He marries nature, he pursues the nymph Echo/' they say) and that of a conscious and organized Prometheus, thief of fire who, guided by thought, persecutes her with an implacable hatred and grossly injures her.47 Ernst describes his identity as an amalgam. The simplest reading of Ernst's text places a psychic alliance of the chthonic, represented by the modern "primitive" and the ancient Greek wood deities, in opposition to Prometheus, the giver of fire. Prometheus functions as a sign of civilization, science, and destruction; he symbolizes the active author in Ernst's psyche, the father who cuts down trees.48 The nature trio relates to the artist-son, who desires to inhabit his unconscious, to lose his ego within nature. However, Ernst's love of complexity and contradiction obscures the clarity of his own division. Granted, Pan pursues the nymph Echo with desire for union, but when thwarted by her, he eventually has her torn apart. In a similar reversal, Prometheus's never-ending punishment associates him with the sacrificial son, as he is bound and devoured by the eagle, the totem father. The 47.

Ernst concludes: Nevertheless, these two attitudes (contradictory in appearance but in reality simply in a state of conflict) that he displays in nearly every domain are convulsively fused into one each time he comes face to face with a fact (such as a tree, a stone, an eye, etc.) and this union is brought about in the same way as that other: when one brings two distant realities together on an apparently antipathetic plane (that which in simple language is called "collage'') an exchange of energy transpires, provoked by this very meeting. This exchange, which might be a broad flowing stream or a shattering stroke of lightning and thunder, I am tempted to consider the equivalent of that which, in classical philosophy, is called identity. I conclude, in transposing the thought of Andre Breton, that IDENTITY WILL BE CONVULSIVE OR WILL NOT EXIST. According to Ernst, the conflicting components that make up identity fuse convulsively in the face of nature, in the same way elements of collage fuse on an alien plane. Signs for this convulsive fusion include flowing water and lightning, natural forces often representative of the unconscious or of inspiration, respectively. In Ernst's iconography, the watery unconscious can appear as a feminine space, the realm of the hysteric, while the bolt of lightning evokes the creative and destructive force of the male ego. The nymph Echo, the mythic nature deity, plays an important role in Ernst's notion of convulsive identity. As inherent mimics, she and the hysteric share a crucial common denominator. Thus if Ernst claims Ran and Papou as components of his psyche, and his jungles emerge from his own unconscious, they are ultimately self-portraits, projections of the artist's convulsive identity before nature. Mimetic landscapes Ernst's western landscapes continue his practice of self-projection, albeit a projection onto a real and experienced landscape rather than solely from his unconscious. Ernst elides this difference through his mythic first encounter (described by Jimmy Ernst) and its activation of the psychic mechanism of objective chance in the recognition of a landscape, which previously haunted his work. As with all his landscapes, those inspired by the Southwest function as self-portraits, mapping his identity with the land, and advancing his broad project of cultural assimilation through the medium of hysterical mimicry. A survey of these landscapes reveals a multitude of formal and iconographic indications of hysteria encoded within them. In previous works, Ernst often referenced the convulsions and tremors of the hysterical body by means of the cataclysmic forces of nature: floods, storms, earthquakes, volcanoes. In "Identite Instantanee," he describes his personality as a "very light earthquake," a phrase that appears as the title of many of his landscape paintings. Volcanoes, ubiquitous throughout his career, figure prominently in his Arizona landscapes. However, hysteria informs Ernst's western landscapes, not only through analogy to traces of convulsive natural forces, but also concretely, in the fantastic ability of the rock configurations to mimic organic forms. In these landscapes, mimesis generates a crisis of identity on three levels. First, Ernst's mimetic subject matter confounds scientific categories. Rocks, plants, animals all lose their identities and take on each other's qualities. Second, the decalcomania technique confuses traditional figure/ground relationships within the painting. Finally, the automatic technique Ernst employs to allow the unconscious to enter the artistic process evaporates the psychic demarcations of ego and complicates the distinction between the artist and his environment. In Ernst's jungle landscapes of the 1930s, mimetic activity resided in the plant and animal life, whereas in the landscapes produced through the use of decalcomania during the 1940s, both before and after his emigration to America, this mimetic faculty becomes a characteristic of the ground itself, literally and figuratively. In a compelling landscape of 1943, The Eye of Silence, strange geological and architectural formations suggest animate beings (fig. 8). Either the rocks metamorphose into living forms or creatures fossilize into rock. The artist as shaman cultivates an animistic worldview and by anthropomorphizing the land he literally animates it. As a seer, he brings forth hallucinatory imagery in the texture of squashed paint, confusing the spatial distinctions between figure and ground. The suggestive technique invites the viewer to participate in the process, possibly even challenging the distinctions between artist and viewer. Throughout the course of his career, Ernst often works in ongoing series of theme and variation based on the exploration of a particular technique, and/ or the recurrence of an obsessive image. While his experimentation with decalcomania subtends his landscapes of the early 1940s, so too does a set of repetitive themes. The mirror-like mountain lake bordered by a reclining female figure, which appears in the lower left of Europe after the Rain II, reappears in the lower right of the Eye of Silence. Ernst also maintains iconographic continuity between his mimetic jungles</page><page sequence="14">222 RES 57/58 SPRING/AUTUMN 2010 Figure 8.

For example, the captive woman in the background of The Nymph Echo, 1936, migrates into the Temptation of Saint Anthony 1945, indicating Ernst's erudite intertwining of themes (fig. 9). In "Mimetisme et psychasthenie legendaire," Caillois cites Gustave Flaubert's Tentation de Saint Antoine as a literary example of mimetic hallucination and the spatial dissolution of self.49 The work, although produced in response to a competition in which the temptation of St. Anthony was the given subject, also seems oddly prophetic one year prior to Ernst's own desert odyssey. The wonder of the Arizona landscape for Ernst was the discovery, not so much of a landscape he had previously imagined, but a landscape that appeared to engage in the same sort of mimesis that he had explored artistically for years. Ernst's first American landscapes still recall those produced in Europe, containing jungles, forests, cypress trees, mountain lakes, and swamps, but gradually the rock formations of the Arizona desert begin to emerge. During his years in the desert, Ernst executed many small landscapes in gouaches, including his series of tiny landscapes called Microbes, in which the textured surface of the medium and the landscape mimic each other. This seems to place Ernst in the position he claimed for himself in 1937, as a viewer at the birth of the work.50 His gouache technique differs slightly from his decalcomanias but still entails the exertion of pressure on wet pigments to generate automatic effects. The figure/ground dichotomy disappears not so much from painting an illustionistic ground over the literal ground, but from all-over compositions, and the dissolution of categories stems less from an intentional disordering of scientific classifications than from the medium's almost accidental resemblance to both desert rocks and coral. While obviously different in size, many of these landscapes resemble the contemporary works of the New York school with their all-over compositions and improvisational techniques. However, in later interviews Ernst always distinguished his work from Abstract Expressionism, or tachism, insisting on the necessity 49. Caillois (see note 45), p. 9. 50.

In 1967, when offered an analogy between a painting and a Rorschach test, Ernst states that "the same stain can in effect suggest, to two artists, two subjects and finally two completely different pictures, and each of these pictures reveals to us particular aspects of the interior world of the painter who created it/'51 This attitude may seem to contradict his earlier stance as passive observer, and points to the fragile position Ernst claims to inhabit as the unconscious author of his art. As pictures of the artist's unconscious, Ernst's Arizona landscapes often do evoke a state of nondifferentiation in which there seems to be no distinction between figure and ground, mass and space, or subjective and objective realms, but more often his automatic techniques are the starting point of a process of active interpretation culminating in imagery rich in symbolic association. Ernst's complex play between subject and object, artist and environment, semantic chaos and iconographic reference suggests an analogy to the active and passive duality inherent in the mimetic faculty. On the one hand, Ernst's effacement of self through automatism, chance, and passive hallucination recalls Caillois's definition of mimesis as a desire for the dissolution of the individual ego and its assimilation into the environment. However, Ernst departs from Caillois by imagining a more chiastic mimesis in which the inanimate can also become animate. He projects his psychic interiority on to the landscape and interprets the resulting forms. Rooted in "sympathetic magic," mimesis can represent a means of control over the environment, Taussig asserts, in which the shaman may "produce any effect desired by imitating it."52 As an interesting comparison, two years prior to Caillois's text, Walter Benjamin penned an essay titled "On the Mimetic Faculty."53 Benjamin regards the mimetic faculty as both a primitive compulsion for alterity and an ancient form of analogical understanding. This faculty, he believes, has decayed in modern humans except among children, but he posits that it lies at the origin of writing and language. He describes it as a nonsensuous, active, conceptual 51. Max Ernst, "Avec Edouard Roditi (1967)/' in Ventures (Raris: Gallimard, 1970). 52. Taussig (see note 12), p. 47. 53.

This contrasts with the more passive, sensuous desire to submit to nature and to lose oneself within it proposed by Caillois. Ernst combines the active, conceptual, and passive, sensuous components of mimesis. He projects his ego onto the environment, but the environment informs the artist in a sort of reciprocal mimicry. Taussig employs the term "mimetic excess" to describe a series of endless reflections confusing the distinctions between self and "other." In his discussion of western anthropology, he locates this destabilization in occurrences where the "other" mimics back, because mimesis grants "the copy the character and power of the original, the representation the power of the represented."54 Apropos Ernst's landscapes, mimetic excess implies a replacement of the traditional authority and mastery of mimetic representation in western art to a more dynamic reciprocity in which the artist cedes mastery and compromises ego integrity through endless mirroring. The concept of mirroring is actually endemic to the process of decalcomania, in which the squashing of paint on canvas, like printmaking, can entail mirror-like repetitions and reversals. For example, in two landscapes titled Inspired Hill, one dated 1949, the other 1950, the contours of the landscape are reversed (figs. 10 and 11). In another version titled Arizona Red (1951) Ernst again reverses the upper half of the original silhouette (fig. 12). Hysterical mimicry transgresses boundaries, the body mirroring the environment and responding to outside suggestion. In Ernst's landscapes the curves of the ground often reflect those of the female body. Ernst's second Inspired Hill glows red as if the female body previously located in the foreground has erupted, transforming the entire landscape into a lava-like womb. Taussig considers the womb "the mimetic organ par excellence," underscoring its reproductive capacity, as much as its traditional association with hysteria.55 His reference to "the pulsational landscape of the mother as the mimetic basis of signification itself," seems an apt description for Ernst's Inspired Hill, which seems to pulse and flow like a living organism.56 Yet, while this might suggest 54.

Like the body of the hysteric in response to suggestions, Ernst portrays the material body of the landscape as receptive to his hallucinatory projections. The sphinx reappears in Coloradeau de Meduse of 1953, as does Ernst's totemic bird (fig. 13). The title, Coloradeau de Meduse, an example of Freudian condensation, refers to the mythical Medusa, Gericault's famous painting The Raft of the Medusa, and Ernst's raft trip down the Colorado. The artist/viewer's gaze reverses Medusa's magic, transforming rock into living creatures. Ernst's painting denies the fixed boundaries of objects and substances. His river shares the red convolutions of the rocks, his rocks the flowing undulations of the river. Fish swim below and above, confusing river, rocks, and sky. It is a world unified through universal mimicry. In 1954 Ernst painted a work he called Ophelia (fig. 14). Visually, he almost seems to have embraced the immersive abstraction of color field painting. The title superimposes Shakespeare's mad virgin, a classic case of hysteria, onto a field of pure mimetic nondifferentiation. Stratified rock mimics the concentric ripples of the water in which Ophelia drowns, the figure itself melting into the undulating ground. The Southwest's intense dry heat engenders a hallucinatory mirage in which desert mimics sea, convulsing the landscape into a single fluid field. Each of these Arizona landscapes acts as a bridge between hysteric mimicry and shamanism. Ernst translates a victimized psychological response into a creative force that can attain spiritually transcendent heights. Even though Ophelia drowns rather than ascends, her drowning seems less a death than a spiritual rebirth. She takes the form of a bird, while the sun takes the shape of an egg. The bird merges completely with the woman, and she with the landscape. In the American Southwest, Ernst discovered a geographical place and a cultural figure that fulfilled the Surrealist desire for a reconciliation of oppositions.57 As a shaman, Ernst could 57. A survey of Breton's work during this period reveals many parallels between his thought and Ernst's. In the "Situation of Surrealism between the Two Wars/' an address given at Yale in 1942 and published in VVV, nos. 2-3 (1943), Breton calls for the destruction of "the old antinomies," enlisting the mentality of the mad, children, and primitives to lift the "barrier between the external and the internal world."

Institutionalized western oppositions could be convulsed?the sexual and the spiritual, the orgasmic and the ecstatic. But the artist recalls us from this cosmic orgy by means of a title, Ophelia, generating active interpretation, implying the reflection of the artist's psyche. Postscript Despite Ernst's ability to recreate himself and his art, he did not find success in America. In his autobiographical notes, Ernst describes the reaction to his work in 1942 as "press hostile or silent, public recalcitrant, sales none," and refers to subsequent American exhibitions as "complete failures."58 His celebrations of the Southwestern landscape did not resonate as such. Possibly, the presence of hysteria in Ernst's landscapes countered the prevailing American attitudes of the Southwest as being a healthy and masculine realm. Interestingly, one critic called Ernst's work "perverse, unhealthy, abnormal," and even the noted Ernst scholar Werner Spies refers to Ernst's American landscapes as "unhealthy, pitiless visions."59 After some travel back and forth, in 1956 he returned to France permanently. The reasons for his return to Europe were complex, including lack of patrons or supportive community, and U.S. government restrictions on new citizens.60 Ernst later wrote both positively and negatively about his years in America, but his attitude is expressed eloquently in his 1965 assemblage titled the Ascension of Mickey, in which the ascending being, no longer the female hysteric, is Disney's cartoon character mouse (fig. 15). While Mickey rises, the egg-like sun points downward to an earthbound kachina doll. Ernst seems to lament the usurpation of Native American art by pop culture. objective and subjective worlds appear again.
