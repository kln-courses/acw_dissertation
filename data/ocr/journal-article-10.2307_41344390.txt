SILBERGELD Animal models of human disease are useful in biomedical research for supporting studies of etiology and pathology and for advancing ther- apy. For the former purposes, development of human disease in a laboratory animal provides more opportunities for understanding mechanisms, pathophysiological progression, and interacting factors than are usually available under clinical conditions. For therapeutics, animal models provide test subjects for the application of novel phar- macotherapies. The ideal animal model for both these purposes would have three characteristics: 1 . The same agent that is suspected of producing disease in humans could be shown to produce dysfunction in the animal. 2. The dysfunction produced would reasonably resemble features of the clinical disease. 3 . Stages of the disease could be reliably distinguished and followed before onset of irreversible or lethal stages. All these conditions are rarely met in animal models. In general, it is usually necessary to modify one of the first two variables so that replication of exposure may be maintained at the expense of similarity of effect, or, alternatively, different agents may be used in order to produce similar effects. For example, in tests of chemical carcinogens or teratogens, it is usually intended to expose animals to the same compound by the same or similar route of exposure, although the effects (in terms of the site of tumorigenesis or type of structural defect) may vary greatly among species. This difference in effect does not Dr. Silbergeld is with the Environmental Defense Fund, 1616 P St., N.W., Washington, DC 20036. 26</page><page sequence="2">ANIMAL MODELS OF NEUROTOXIC DISEASES decrease the relevance or utility of the animal model for purposes of toxicology testing [1]. Alternatively, most animal models of human diseases such as par- kinsonism have emphasized similarities in neuropathological and neur- ochemical effects. For these effects, the selective neurotoxin 6- hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) has been widely used, yet 6-OHDA is not considered to be an etiologic factor in human parkinsonism [2] . It is rather rare to discover an agent such as methyl-4-phenyl-l ,2,5,6-tetra- hydropyridine (MPTP) as a cause of parkinsonism in humans [3]; the role of MPTP in idiopathic parkinsonism except in meperidine abusers is not yet known. Human neuropsychiatrie disorders present particular problems for the development of animal models since they involve, to a very great extent, the complex biological function of the human brain, human social experiences, and specifics of human intellectual/psychological development [4]. There are no obviously appropriate analogs for these phenomena in animals, particularly in laboratory animals reared for generations in socially stereotyped artificial conditions. The species and conditions that come closer to resembling the complexities of human psychosocial states- such as the resident primate colonies de- veloped at the University of Wisconsin and the Yerkes Primate Cen- ter-have the drawbacks of great expense for extensive neurotoxicolo- gical or neuropharmacological investigations [5]. Because of the relatively small numbers that can be used from such populations, it is difficult to develop large amounts of data, and to resolve problems of variability in results derived from small numbers. The diagnosis and evaluation of many human mental disorders de- pend greatly upon self-description and assessments requiring verbal responses by the subject. In clinical neurotoxicology, such techniques appear to be among the most sensitive and possibly most specific measures of early, low-dose effects of such agents as heavy metals, solvents, and carbon disulfide (see Baker and co-workers in this volume and [6]). However, researchers are not capable of discerning the inter- nal states of laboratory rodents, although interpretation of some types of learning paradigms can provide great insight, and certain schools of physiological psychology propose paradigms that explore aspects of mental states such as attention and consummately behavior [7]. 27</page><page sequence="3">ELLEN К. SILBER GELD Given these limits, it is likely that animal models of human mental disorders cannot be designed to produce anthropomorphic signs and syndromes in different species. In most instances these models are designed to follow more closely conditions of exposure to environmen- tal pollutants hypothesized to be etiologic factors. These issues have been extensively considered in a number of re- views (see, for instance, [8]). This paper is concerned with another issue: the use of animal models to develop preclinical markers of exposure and effects for neuropsychiatrie disorders associated with exposure to environmental pollutants. Development and use of markers in neuropsychiatrie disorders Markers are indicators of disease progression and, in toxicology, of internal dose and response. Markers range, as shown in Figure 1 , from indicators of exposure to indicators of effect. In addition, there are markers of susceptibility, or risk factors, which indicate the character- istics of the host or receptor that modulate internal dose (toxicokine- tics) and response. The growth of biomedical interest in markers re- flects a number of factors, among them growth of knowledge of the preclinical course of disease or intoxication, and successes in therapeu- tic intervention at early stages of pathophysiology. Markers of exposure In evaluating the role of environmental pollutants in mental disorder, it is important to be able to determine exposure. This may be done indirectly, as in occupational medicine, where work history and work- place measurements are often used to indicate exposure (see Landri- gan, this volume). Outside the work environment, this type of exposure assessment is less reliable, although detection of toxic chemicals in drinking water, household dust, or ambient air is usually considered evidence of likely exposure, and semiquantitative estimates are then developed on the basis of standard parameters of water intake, air volume, etc. In individual cases, however, more precise determination of dose is necessary. For this purpose, markers of exposure must be 28</page><page sequence="4">ANIMAL MODELS OF NEUROTOXIC DISEASES Markers for lead: exposure and effects.

Animal models can be used to provide the basic data for establishing exposure markers under conditions in which external or environmental exposure can be controlled and quantitated and various tissues or fluids can be sampled during or after exposure. All exposure markers reflect some degree of response by the indi- vidual organism to exposure. Even blood lead levels are influenced by hemoglobin concentrations, which can themselves be lowered by the effects of lead on heme and globin biosynthesis [9]. Nevertheless, internal markers that are relatively unaffected by biological response are frequently referred to as biological monitors. Biological monitoring of the central nervous system (CNS) is limited because of the relative inaccessibility of the CNS. In some instances, cerebrospinal fluid may be available for chemical analysis; but more frequently, inferences must be drawn on the basis of blood or urine 29</page><page sequence="5">ELLEN К.

These measurements of internal dose are remote from exposure at neuronal sites of action. Only under steady-state conditions or long-term exposure can it be assumed that there is a predictable relationship between blood and brain concentrations of a chemical. Distorting the relationship between blood and brain concentrations of a toxic substance are such factors as (1) the blood:brain barrier, which impedes the uptake of many xeno- biotics or synthetic environmental pollutants into the brain [10]; (2) the high concentration of lipids in the brain, which preferentially accumu- late lipophilic substances [11]; and (3) the slow removal of specifically bound substances owing to the relatively slow turnover rate of many macromolecules in the brain, particularly after early development [12,13].

Blood lead levels in neonatally exposed rats in early stages of exposure are higher and increase at a faster rate than do lead levels in brain tissue (Figure 2). After two weeks of exposure, the brain level rises more rapidly than brain lead levels (probably because of the peripheral "sink" for lead in bone) [14]. Figure 3 shows results of toxicokinetic clearance experiments with PCBs [15] . PCB levels in fat fall much more slowly than those in blood. In organic mercury exposure, elevated mercury concentrations persist much longer in the brain than in the blood (Figure 4) [16], partly because binding sites on enzymes, membranes, and other proteins turn over relatively slowly. Markers of internal dose in the central nervous system are difficult to achieve. In the case of metals, even the use of chelation challenge or provocative mobilization, when available, is unlikely to yield much 31</page><page sequence="7">ELLEN К.

Since most chelants do not cross the blood-brain barrier, they tend to draw only from larger pe- ripheral body stores. Recent developments in tomographic imaging, nuclear magnetic resonance, and other in situ analytic techniques may improve exposure assessment by permitting visualization of some neurotoxins, if they contain biologically rare elements (such as fluorine) or heavy metals. However, quantitation of these techniques is not yet available. A widespread and growing problem in interpreting biological mark- ers arises when toxic chemicals are broadly disseminated throughout the environment. As a consequence of unconstrained industrial and consumer use, many neurotoxins are found in blood, breast milk, and tissue samples of many persons who have not been specifically exposed to them. (See, for instance, the World Health Organization Global 32</page><page sequence="8">ANIMAL MODELS OF NEUROTOXIC DISEASES Environmental Monitoring Studies.) In such cases, markers of internal dose, if only qualitative in definition, may be insufficient to indicate specific exposure above the general level of environmental or dietary contamination. Markers of effect Markers of early neurotoxic effects present the most promising areas for preclinical research related to understanding environmental factors in human neuropsychiatrie disorders. In considering these markers, one must assume that neurotoxic injury proceeds from primary bio- chemical alteration, through reversible cellular injury, to irreversible cytotoxicity and permanent organic lesion. The purpose of developing markers of neurotoxic effect is to obtain reliable indicators of early- stage effects, related to biochemical and morphological alterations, that precede actual cell damage. Biochemical markers of nervous system function fall into two cate- gories: those that relate to general cell physiology and metabolism, and those that relate to biochemical pathways specialized in nerve cells. With respect to the first type of markers, nonspecific biochemical parameters may be used as markers of neurological function because of differences in cellular metabolism between nervous and nonneural cells. Neurons have very high requirements for oxygen and energy and consequently are very sensitive to anoxia [17], to metabolic poisons such as hydrogen sulfide [18], and to deprivation of glucose, such as insulin hypoglycemia [19]. There are also biochemical reactions specific to nerve cells, related to the synthesis and degradation of molecules that modulate cell-cell communication by means of altering cell membrane potential. These pathways - precursors, substrates, enzymes, cofactors, and products - are unique to, or are highly concentrated in, neurons. Even when the same product is present in neural and nonneural cells, different meta- bolic pathways may be involved in its regulation - for instance, mela- nin in the pigmented neurons of the basal ganglia is synthesized by pathways different from those in peripheral melanocytes [20]. However, most biochemical reactions in the CNS take place in a restricted space. Few indicators - substrates or metabolites - escape 33</page><page sequence="9">ELLEN К. SILBER GELD the confines of the synapse. For example, the neurotransmitter acetyl- choline is rapidly and completely hydrolyzed after release within the synapse by acetylcholinesterase, so that none of the released transmit- ter escapes the neuronal milieu [21]. Nevertheless, there are some precursors and metabolic products of neuromodulatory chemicals that can be measured in blood or urine. Experimental work has focused on the precursors and metabolites of the biogenic amines: tryptophan, tyrosine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), dihydroxyphenylace- tic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-methoxy,4-hydroxy- phenylglycol (MOPEG), vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA), and phenethy- lamine. There is an extensive literature on the relationship between levels of these compounds in brain and the activity of cells utilizing serotonin, dopamine, or norepinephrine as transmitters. The relationships between these substances appearing in blood or urine and the functional state of CNS neurotransmission can be deter- mined only through experimental studies. In animals, it is possible to undertake the necessary correlative studies to analyze neuronal activity along with the kinetics of precursor/product/metabolite relationships (see, for instance, the work of Walters &amp; Roth [22] on dopaminergic neurophysiology and neurochemistry). However, correlations between neurochemical markers and actual neurotoxicity, particularly in terms of predicting later overt disease, are uncertain. Studies have examined the relationship between transmitter metabolites and neuropsychiatrie disorders such as parkinsonism, schizophrenia, and manic-depressive illness [23-25]. At present, data do not permit the use of these mea- sures diagnostically; but they may, in some cases, be useful in refining classification of illness and in measuring pharmacotherapeutic re- sponse. Relatively few studies of this type have been undertaken in experi- mental studies of neurotoxins. An early study by Dugandzic and co- workers [26] reported increases in the urinary excretion of 5-HIAA in lead-exposed workers. As shown in Figure 5, studies of the effects of chronic lead exposure on levels of HVA in urine of children were undertaken after earlier studies in mice had demonstrated correlations between brain and urinary catecholamine metabolites [27]. These stud- ies reported increased levels of HVA in the brain and urine of exposed mice and in urine of exposed children.

Bars and shaded areas indicate means and standard deviations for HVA determinations in control chil- dren (for details, see [27]). catecholamine function are variable, possibly among brain regions [28] . However, the changes in metabolites that have been reported are consistent with increased turnover of transmitters and increased elec- trophysiological activity [29]. But the observation of parallel findings in brain and urine does not conclusively demonstrate that the CNS is either the origin of increased urinary HVA or the site of lead-induced alterations. There are significant extra-CNS sources of urinary HVA, and nonneural physiological processes affect the clearance and excre- tion of acidic metabolites. Nevertheless, in certain cases these 35</page><page sequence="11">ELLEN К. SILBER GEW measurements hold promise as preclinical indicators of neurotoxic damage. Other neurochemical markers have been little exploited in psychia- try or neurotoxicology. Some of these substances- such as 7-aminobu- tyric acid (GABA), glycine, aspartate, and glutamate- have major roles in intermediate metabolism that confound their use exclusively as markers of CNS neurotransmission [30]. It is not possible to infer a significant effect on nervous system function on the basis of even relatively great changes in circulating levels of these amino acids. Also, the amino acid transmitters appear to be subject to considerable conser- vation within the nervous system, so that released transmitters are subject to reuptake and reutilization for release [31]. This neurochemi- cal economy may make such pathways relatively resistant to the effects of these amino acids when administered peripherally (via diet) even in high doses- for example, recent studies on the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate (both licensed as food additives in the United States) have shown relatively little neurotoxic effect in adult rodents [32]. Neuropeptides and their fragments can be measured by radioim- munoassay in plasma, but there is little correlative research currently available to relate plasma levels to CNS function of peptidergic path- ways. However, since, in some cases, peripherally secreted peptides may affect the brain (for instance, cholecystokinin [CCK] and bombesin), levels of these compounds in plasma may have important effects on brain. Similarly, some of the gonadotropins of pituitary origin and the gonadal hormones are reported to have CNS actions (see the paper by Hruška in this volume). These substances would not, strictly speaking, be markers of neurotoxic effects, but would consti- tute actual effects of toxic exposure, indirectly mediated via other organs or systems, on the nervous system [33]. Research in this area may be very productive both of new markers and of refinements in our understanding of brain function in clinical studies. Other measures of brain metabolism are becoming available with advances in biomedical techniques. Studies of 2-deoxyglucose utiliza- tion and of the binding of appropriately tagged neurotransmitter recep- tor ligands permit in vivo study of brain function at the biochemical level. Little of the necessary investigation at the basic level has been done to determine the effects of "reference" neurotoxins - such as 36</page><page sequence="12">ANIMAL MODELS OF NEUROTOXIC DISEASES lead, mercury, or solvents- on these parameters, neuronal glucose metabolism, or receptor ligand binding. However, there are several reports of effects of metals on receptor binding in rodents [28], which would support measuring such effects by quantitative densitometry in order to support position emission tomography in humans. Such tech- niques, for studying cerebral blood flow, have been used to determine the effects of solvents in humans [34]. Markers of risk The final type of biological marker of relevance in determining the neurotoxic (and other) effects of environmental pollutants in humans is the marker of susceptibility, or indicator of host-related factors that may modulate both internal dose and response. There is considerable research on risk markers as indicators of predisposing factors for neuropsychiatrie disorders, such as plasma dopamine beta-hydroxylase or platelet monoamine oxidase [35,36]. There are no data on the rela- tionship between such preexisting variance in neurologic function and response to neurotoxicants. Certain conditions or exposures such as infection, alcoholism, mental disorder, or head injury are usually cause for excluding subjects from epidemiological studies. It would be inter- esting to study whether these and other conditions exacerbate or reduce the neurotoxic effects of toxin exposure. This is an area that could be explored by experimental research. Use of markers for studying progression of intoxication Markers of early toxic effects may be used to predict later, more serious, functional alterations in the progress of intoxication states. The distinction between such "preclinical" markers and actual toxicity or disease changes with developments in nosology and medical consen- sus. This is illustrated in the history of medical concepts of lead poison- ing [37]. Before 1960 it was widely held that only seizures and pro- found mental retardation constituted the neurotoxic, encephalopathic syndromes of lead poisoning. Other neuropsychiatrie effects, if noted, were classified as signs and symptoms. Over the next 20 years, neuro- behavioral disabilities and decreased intelligence were described, and 37</page><page sequence="13">ELLEN К. SILBER GELD are now considered to be diseases induced by lead in children. As a consequence, the definition of preclinical markers of lead toxicity has advanced into areas of cortical electroencephalography, evoked re- sponse, peripheral neurophysiology, and psychometric performance [38]. As seen in the example of lead, the definition of effect markers shifts in response to two factors: changing concepts concerning the accept- ability of subtle dysfunction, and increases in the power of earlier effects to predict later effects (i.e., the relation between "subclinical" and "clinical" manifestations). Animal models cannot provide much information relevant to the first factor, but can be valuable in determin- ing the second factor, the predictive relationships between early and late markers of effect. Predictability is based upon statistical associations and upon under- standing of mechanisms of action. For instance, experimental models of hexacarbon transport is a major mechanism of the toxic action of 2,5-hexanedione (the neurotoxic metabolite of hexacarbon solvents). It has been hypothesized that this metabolite may act by producing a pyrrole adduct [39] that may be measurable in urine. If so, this sub- stance could be used as a marker. Understanding mechanisms can increase the predictive value of al- ready identified markers by elucidating their role in pathophysiological processes. A recently proposed mechanism for understanding lead poisoning involves the hypothesis that the porphyrin precursor &lt;5- aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (whose levels are greatly elevated by lead) is neuroactive specifically on GABAergic neurons [28]. On this basis, the relatively early effects of lead exposure in increasing levels of this porphyrin precursor in many organs, including the brain, may be considered to predict neurotoxicity. This hypothesis enhances the value of measuring ALA (in urine or plasma of lead-exposed persons) as a marker of lead neurotoxicity, in addition to its well-established status as an indicator of lead effects on heme biosynthesis. Mechanistic studies of other putative neurotoxins need to be done in order to yield new markers or to support réévaluation of others. If animal models using the agent identified as causative in human disease can be developed, then markers of disease progression can be identified. Experimental research provides unique opportunities for 38</page><page sequence="14">ANIMAL MODEIS OF NEUROTOXIC DISEASES studying members of similarly exposed cohorts over time. Such studies may reveal early effect markers, which can be incorporated into sur- veillance of human populations. This may be important for toxicology in determining truly protective standards for occupational and environ- mental hazards. In other areas of biomedical research, these types of markers may provide signals for early therapeutic intervention. There is relatively little research in this area in neurotoxicology. An example from another area, neuroimmunology, demonstrates the types of markers it may be relevant to consider. Scrapie, one of the neurodegenerative, slowly progressing, viral diseases, can be pro- duced in hamsters by intracerebral injection of brain tissue from affect- ed sheep [40]. However, not all treated animals are infected successful- ly; and, in those that are, the progress of the disease is not readily detectable until the animal is near death, at which stage irreversible neuropathological damage has already occurred. A marker of success- ful inoculation and premorbid intoxication was needed to investigate early stages of the disease. Because the behavioral signs of late-stage intoxication resem- ble aspects of hyperactivity of serotonergic pathways, it was reasoned that a marker of early effects of scrapie infection might relate to serotonergic function. Two lines of investigation were undertaken, neurochemical and neurobehavioral. As shown in the table, both ap- proaches yielded markers of effect, in terms of significant alterations in levels of 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and in response to serotonergic drugs [40,4 1] . The neurobehavioral marker (response to 5-hydroxytryptophan [5- HTP] or quipazine) has advantages over neurochemical analyses in that infectious tissue from the inoculated animal does not have to be han- dled. Similar effect markers using neuropharmacological probes or chal- lenges have been used in experimental studies of estrogen treatment (see Hruška in this volume). Conclusions This paper has dealt with the use of animal models of neurotoxic disease for developing and validating markers of exposure and effect. In most of the examples cited, the animal models resembled human disease states in terms of exposure rather than effect. As indicated 39</page><page sequence="15">ELLEN К .

The search for homology of expression can, in most instances, be misleading and involve somewhat tortuous claims of similarity. Until there is good agreement on the relationship between certain well- described human mental illnesses and behavioral states in animals, this will not yield much helpful information. In the absence of such agree- ment, certain fundamental behavioral states in animals, such as loco- motor activity, active and passive avoidance, and simple maze learn- ing, are likely to be most useful for determining neurotoxic effects. Attempts to describe spontaneously elicited behaviors in rodents more comprehensively and quantitatively have been made on only a limited basis; better description of standard behaviors - e.g., exploration, catalepsy, and gait - can be developed to yield more information. These 40</page><page sequence="16">ANIMAL MODELS OF NEUROTOXIC DISEASES approaches have already demonstrated sensitivity for detecting early neurotoxic effects, as in our studies of the effects of estradiol and the artificial food color erythrosin В on response to cataleptogenic agents [42; DeRyck, Bradley, &amp; Silbergeld. In preparation] and the effects of manganese and kainic acid on gait and locomotion [43]. Finally, there is a need to increase communication between clinical and experimental toxicologists, so that clinical researchers can extract from the experimental literature the findings that are applicable as markers of exposure and effect, and experimental researchers can un- dertake studies that will provide information from animals that can also be explored in humans.
