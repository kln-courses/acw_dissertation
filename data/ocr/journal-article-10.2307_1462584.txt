<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of the American Academy of Religion, LI/4 The Great Epic of India as Religious Rhetoric: A Fresh Look at the Mahalbhflrata James L. FitzgeraldI In 1946 Stella Kramrisch published what has become a classic in the field of nonmodern Indian cultural studies, her two-volume presentation of the Hindu temple as an actual reproduction of the essential structure and substance of the universe and as a comprehensive locus for the various forms of intercourse between people and the gods. Gods reside in temples and play in and about them; they are present there to receive offerings of food, hymns of praise, and other outpourings of devotion from human beings and to return blessings and benefits to their devotees. Kramrisch explicated a langue of the Hindu temple which was reproduced in count- less inristances of parole of varying age, style, and size scattered throughout India. Perhaps there has been no single institution more centrally impor- tant to the religious praxis, feelings, and imaginative theoretical projections of Hindu people for at least the past fifteen hundred years. Though the comparison cannot be made strictly, the Mahabharata also existed in both a single, fixed, ideal form-an old Sanskrit Great Bhirata, which was committed to written form in the early centuries of the Christian era-and in numerous other versions-in Sanskrit and in the regional vernacular languages of India-and both forms of MahM- bharata pervaded all of India as did the temple. And like the temple, the epic was important to that congeries of religions we habitually refer to as Hinduism in a fundamental way, though of course the epic worked through a very different medium, conveying, at one of its levels, a par- ticular, verbally formulable, ideological message. But in spite of their very different realizations, the Great Bharata and the Hindu temple James L. Fitzgerald (Ph.D., Chicago) is Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. I This paper is based on the author's inaugural lecture in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. It constitutes an attempt to open up certain large themes interpreting the Mahabharata, and it is deliberately speculative and suggestive.</page><page sequence="2">612 Journal of the American Academy of Religion converged on that common ground which was and is the major locus of the religious activities and expressions of Hindu people, the materially and socially constituted world of everday life. In fact the Great Bhdrata was the first clear and sustained articulation of that locus in the complex, synthetic terms which underlie the Hindu religions. A sense of vastness is one of the basic characteristics of that locus, a full, densely thronged vastness, as evoked so well by that strangely thick and rounded spire of many Hindu temples-a mass which often seems to swell out as it tapers softly upward; a mass with its surface often crowded by a close-wrought geometric pattern, or thronged with figures, sometimes teeming with voluptuousness. The Maha-, or Great, Bharata, the "great epic of India"-the comprehensive and "augmented" version of the mythic-epic war between two branches of the preeminent royal family of ancient Northern India, the Bharatas-suggests a similar cos- mic density and vastness by its size, by the luxurious complexity of its plot, and by the mythic intention of its theme. The Great BhArata came to have 100,000 couplets in its written Sanskrit form; it teems with char- acters (each with several different names), and events proliferate, events which are often "thick" and "heavy" in their grotesqueness. Through the plethora of its words, actions, images, and feelings the Great Bhdirata has revealed, argued, exemplified, and inculcated a profound new vision of the cosmos and the place and value of the rightly ordered human society in that cosmos. Like the temple, the Great BhArata presented that cos- mos to the senses and imagination of its audience, in such a way that its members could envision themselves within it and intuit its structure or apprehend the movement across its time, and in such a way that they would know and feel their proper place, and so perform their proper actions in the cosmos. As did the temple, the Great Bhdirata functioned as the rhetoric of a manifold and rich religious system. The Great Bhairata presents a host of problems to Western readers who are concerned to understand the text in its cultural context. Its size and complexity make its narrative and intellectual continuities difficult to apprehend precisely. And as to its cultural context, the general histori- cal period in which the text was formed can be specified no more pre- cisely than as a span of seven hundred to nine hundred years. The text which we now have-a text resulting from a critical editorial process based on the entire extant tradition of Sanskrit manuscripts of the Great Bhilrata-certainly existed, as a fixed, written text, by A.D. 500. It is likely that it existed by A.D. 200 or A.D. 300. But the text is manifestly the product of a complex, polydynamic formative process, and we can- not separate all the different contributions to the text in any clear way and connect them to definite and datable social or cultural phenomena outside the text. The idea of our Great Bharata may go as far back as 200 B.C., or even 400 B.C., and parts of the epic narrative which forms</page><page sequence="3">Fitzgerald: Great Epic 613 the body of the Great Bhatrata may well be based on heroic cycles going back to 1000 B.C. (Biihler and Kirste; Hopkins, 386-402). The general period from 500 B.C. to A.D. 500 in Northern India was one of the most dynamic times of Indian history. It saw the rise and decline of two grand Indian empires-the Mauryan and the Gupta-and the invasion of Northern India from the Northwest by Greeks, Scythians, KuStnas, and Huns, all of whom exercised some degree of political control over signifi- cantly large parts of Northern India at one time or another during this time. Economic, political, and social infrastructures underwent dramatic changes in the course of this millenium. Perhaps most significant, cultur- ally, for the Brahmin elite of North India at that time was the rise of pow- erful religious groups which enjoyed a great deal of patronage from the newly emergent institutions controlling wealth and political power; reli- gions which denied the power of the ancient Vedic hymns and ancient sacrificial rituals of the Brahmins; religions which, at least in the case of Buddhism, recruited a significant part of their elite from good Brahmin families and which scattered the countryside with shrines and monasteries. Also, Buddhism was strongly endorsed by imperial edicts permanently inscribed on pillars erected throughout his empire by the third century B.C. Buddhist emperor Aioka, the emperor who was "free from grief" (a-4oka), because of his Buddhist religion. It was in the midst of this context, which presumably was fraught with provocation and challenge for many Brahmins (who were often affiliated with more simply organized tribal republics or kingdoms in the North Central heartland of India2), that the Great Bhirata emerged as a new kind of Brahmin text. The Great Bhdirata was the first serious reli- gious text of the Brahmin tradition which was not directly or indirectly a part of the ancient, primordial Vedas transmitted to the Aryan culture by the ancient seers.3 The Great Bhirata was a dramatic new religious beginning for the Brahmin tradition. But at the same time, it called upon that tradition and made use of it. As it presents itself, the Great Bhdrata has the same purposes and power which Brahmins had earlier ascribed to the Vedas; that is, it contains all knowledge necessary for the 2 An observation of fact I owe to Ronald Inden of the University of Chicago. ' This simplification is, of course, based on regarding the irauta, grhya, and dharma satras as extensions of the Vedic textual tradition. All conceptions of Veda(s), sruti, Vedic tradition, Vedism, and so on, whether the terms be Brahminic or Western, are generaliza- tions which obscure very substantial differences in religious sensibilities within the texts so designated, while they magnify and emphasize certain salient intentions seen to embrace the whole. What I am deliberately highlighting here is the distinction between "the Vedic corpus" as a particular, massively influential textual tradition and the Great Bharata of Vy.sa as a particular text which, though largely constructed from diverse traditional ele- ments, was deliberately conceived and promulgated for certain broad purposes, and which was commensurate in importance to the Vedic corpus.</page><page sequence="4">614 Journal of the American Academy of Religion social, material, and religious welfare of human beings. And like the four ancient Vedas, the power of its acoustic reality alone, that is, the power of its merely being recited, is potent, is capable of purifying the effects of one's evil actions and promoting one's material and bodily well-being. But the text does not resemble the hymns of the Veda at all; it is a narra- tive text which is replete with all manner of didactic wisdom. And it is a text which has, in its intention, and in fact, moved away from the social exclusivism and esotericism of the Vedic Brahmin tradition. The Great Bhdirata presents itself as a new Veda, a fifth Veda, the Veda for all members of society, for women and Sfodras as well as Brahmin, Ksatriya, and Vaisya men (Fitzgerald, forthcoming). The Great Bhdirata's strenuous comparison of itself to the ancient tra- dition of the Vedas underscores its distinctiveness with respect to it, a dis- tinctiveness which the text itself recognizes. Even within its assimilation of itself to the Vedas, the Great Bhdirata presents itself as initiating a distinct new textual tradition. The author of the Great Bharata was a new seer, the son and grandson of illustrious Vedic seers, who had not himself contrib- uted to the corpus of the Vedic hymns. This seer, Vyssa, had contributed to the Vedic tradition by dividing into four distinct Vedas what had been up to then the simple, unitary corpus of Vedic hymns (because humans had become too feeble mentally to comprehend the simple corpus). After doing this, Vydsa proceeded to compose many of the fundamental texts of Brah- minic Hinduism-the Great Bhdirata, the eighteen great collections of his- torical and religious lore which served, in many cases, as philosophic and ritual encyclopedias for different sectarian groups (the eighteen Great Purdnas), and, not the least by any means, the definitive hermeneutic guide to the Upanishads-the secret yogic teachings which constituted, for many, the culmination of the ancient Vedic tradition-(the Brahma, or VedA~nta, Sftras). Thus the seer Vyisa spans the gap between Vedic Brah- minism and Hindu Brahminism, and the Great Bhdirata was his first effort in the new direction. As I indicated above, the historical problems and structural complex- ity of the text make the Great Bhdirata a difficult and sometimes frustrat- ing text to deal with. It now appears likely that large parts of the text, if not all of it, arose within traditions of extemporaneous oral presentation (de Jong; O'Flaherty), and that the text we now have represents some type of fixed abstraction from one complex didactic and epic tradition, or from two or more such traditions. What intermediate stages of redaction the whole or parts of it passed through are matters for speculation alone, as are the questions of when, where, and by whom this was accomplished. The greater part of the Western scholarly tradition of Indology has had a difficult time appropriating the Great Bhiirata. Earlier (ca. 1880-1920) the basic tendency was to historicize any indication of heterogeneity in the text and search for the simple and primitive heroic epic which, most</page><page sequence="5">Fitzgerald: Great Epic 615 scholars thought, must have formed the core of the text; to locate the Bharata epic of the Bhdrata war within Vyisa's Great Bhdirata. A massive critical edition of the Sanskrit manuscript tradition was undertaken from within this analytic tradition. It was completed in 1966, after more than forty years of diligent work, but it failed to uncover the hoped for kernel. Only about one-eighth of the traditional Great Bharata was found not to be represented in all extant manuscripts of the Sanskrit text. Today we are in the midst of a resurgence of interest in the Great Bharata, and most good scholarship now being done on the text undertakes to understand that text which the tradition itself finalized and appropriated at least fifteen hundred years ago. That text is my own starting point, and I believe that if one will accept looser types of intellectual continuity than are found in genres of carefully elaborated discourse-such as certainly did develop in India, to a high degree-then it is possible to perceive clear lines of ideological continuity joining the mythic-epic narrative of the Great Bhdrata and the greater part of its didactic components (Pisani; L6vi). Given its vast size, its narra- tive complexity, and the probably incredibly complex process of develop- ment which produced it, there is actually an amazing degree of internal thematic consistency in the Great Bhdrata. At the same time, I am con- vinced that no single line of meaningful continuity will ever be located within the text that will comprehend and exhaust the whole of the Great Bhiirata, that will embrace every detail in a consistent way. Nonetheless, it is possible to trace a broad theme which functions to unite most of the text into a clearly identifiable ideological statement which makes good sense in the general cultural context I sketched earlier. As many Indians have said repeatedly, the center of this ideological continuity in the Great BhArata is the Bhagavad Gitai. The Gitdi explic- itly states an ethic for the proper conduct of life, such that the interests of both society and the individual person would be satisfied to the high- est degrees possible, and it reveals an ontology which articulates those interrelationships among persons, the world, and that which is of ulti- mate value and which makes this complex ethic possible and plausible. The mythic-epic Great Bhdzrata serves this ideology as a rhetoric by presenting dramatically the problems of action which the Gitil's ethic is primarily concerned to resolve, and by portraying with overwhelming emotional power the process of action necessary to reestablish in the world the order of human society which conforms to that ontology and forms the setting of that ethic. Furthermore, when its narrative has reached its rhetorical climax, with its audience completely drained and exhausted, the Great Bharata then relaxes and shifts to a rambling didactic mode and presents a host of ethical, religious, and philosophical teachings which generally support the central ideology in a loose way. This large stock of teachings is intended to serve as a revealed library of</page><page sequence="6">616 Journal of the American Academy of Religion ethics and religion in the new social and political order established through the events portrayed in the Great Bharata. Thus, at the highest level of generality, the Great Bhdrata is a powerfully dramatized and comprehensive revelation of the normative structure of human society and the account of how it was reestablished at the end of the last cosmic epoch and the beginning of the current one. I am sure most readers are familiar with the argument of the Bha- gavad GitM, but since this text does constitute the ideological center of the Great Bhdirata, it is necessary to restate the fundamental points of the argument in order to present its rhetorical vehicle. The primary ethical thrust of the GitOt is to revalorize the socially and materially constituted world as the most important locus for the most important religious endeavors of human beings. Using the narrative setting of the Great Bhdrata, the GitOi endorses and encourages action in the world, action proper to oneself in terms of one's place in the world, by rearticulating the nature and purpose of, and authority for, such action, and by assimilating such action to the religious perspective which had become preeminent in much of Indian religious thought by approxi- mately 300 B.C., the perspective of yoga. "Yoga" is one's perfection within oneself of a state of ultimate value which is potential within one- self through one's assiduous pursuit of some self-transformative method, that is, through some regular regimen or discipline. As part of the real- ization of that state of ultimate value, all varieties of Indian yoga, Bud- dhist, Jain, and Hindu, including the yoga advocated by the Bhagavad Gitd, ideally lead to escape (moksa) from the beginningless cycle of life, death, and transmigration to another life and death and transmigration again (sam.sidra), in which all conscious, living beings are caught-by reason of the self-perpetuating continuity of the actions all of them under- take and prosecute in their own interest-and which is replete with disappointment, frustration, alienation, and suffering. In many forms of Hindu yoga, escape from sams~ira is but the negative side of a single self- transformative process of which the positive side is a perfection of oneself which involves realization of one or another type of union with a postulated ultimate entity. The Gitd's main argument is that human beings can and should effect the yogic religious transformation of themselves into fully perfected beings, enjoying eternal union with the ultimate entity of all being, God, within the context of the normatively proper four-caste society, and through the activities ordained as proper for one as a member of one of the four general castes. The yoga advocated by the Giti! is called, with some irony, the karmayoga, the regimen which consists of doing one's proper action in one's proper social place, one's dharma. The irony stems from the fact that it is actions which perpetuate a person's existence in sam.sa-ra, and yet this yoga consists of actions. The affirmation of living in terms of</page><page sequence="7">Fitzgerald: Great Epic 617 one's proper social roles that the Gitt makes runs counter to the yogic ideals articulated from the seventh or eighth century B.C. onward by Brahmins, in some of the Upanishads, and by Buddhists and Jains (Jains were the first cousins of Buddhists in general social and institutional historical terms, though their ontology and yogic method were very different). These earlier yogas advocated renunciation of one's property and the social context which defined one's individual personality and roles in life. Striving for the state of ultimate perfection involved, in these yogas, a radical demotivation of action, of all action, to the highest degree possible (and for a Brahmin that would ultimately require for- saking the Vedic sacrificial action)-a demotivation of action which involved a radical depersonalization of the perceived world, a deperson- alization achieved through a thoroughly detached way of life and a meditative regimen which eventually brought the individual into experi- ential contact with a reality wholly different from the world of objects, concepts, feelings, impulses, and actions, all structured by one's own ego implicit at the center of one's normal experience. The Bhagavad GitOz accepted the basic psychology of these Upani- shadic and Buddhist self-transformative regimens. It too insisted that one must detach oneself from one's normal world of desires and actions in order to do away with the limited version of oneself and realize the state of ultimate perfection. But it argued that this transformation could and should occur primarily within the context of the social and material world, within the context of one's specific social and material reality as a Brahmin, Ksatriya, Vaisya, or Sfidra. According to the Gitil, the same kind of yogic self-perfection produced by earlier yogas was necessary for a person's ultimate satisfaction and fulfillment, but a person was also required to act and fulfill the obligations inherent in a particular place within the psycho-material cosmic unity (prakrti). According to the Gitt, a person was required to act and demotivate action at the same time. The Gitl argued this revolutionary ethical point on the basis of a revo- lutionary new ontology which revalorized the material world of ordinary experience that the earlier, simpler yogic philosophies had devalorized. The new ontology of the Gitil effectively replaced the older, impersonal notion of the ultimate reality as the eternal power-substance brahman with a personal deity, Visnu,4 who fulfilled the same cosmological functions 4 The Gita itself does not emphasize the identity of God as Visnu. In the Gita, the human Krishna simply speaks of himself as a uniquely transcendent personal being who has descended into the world in human form to revivify dharma (BhG 4.6-8). Only once in the Gitd does he call himself Visnu (BhG 10.21). Nonetheless, other parts of the Great Bharata assert that Krishna is Visnu, or Ndrdyana (another figure, whose background is obscure, which was synthesized into this early Vaisnava ideology as a form or aspect of the ultimate God), and these identifications are to be taken for granted when the Great Bharata is considered synchronously, as it must be in any effort to interpret it.</page><page sequence="8">618 Journal of the American Academy of Religion brahman had, but who did more, who was personally interested in the world which issued forth from part of himself (BhG 3.24; 4.7, 13), who was the source of the structure inherent in that world, dharma (BhG 4.13; 14.27), an order which made possible the ultimate welfare of all creatures within it (lokasamgraha, BhG 3.25). Within this new ontology, the entire world is part of God, including the bodies and psyches of all people, and the ultimate, unchanging, eternal part of all people, the ultimate self in each, is also God (BhG 4.35; 6.30; 7.4-5; 13.2; 14.3; 15.7, 12-15, 16-18; 18.61). And within the framework of this new ontology the yogic trans- formative process has as its ultimate end not the complete dissolution of the psychological self, leaving only the essence (atman) of oneself which is understood to be the pure, simple brahman, the impersonal, unqualified absolute, but a union with a personal God (BhG 4.9-10; 6.31, and passim), who is beyond brahman and has brahman as a part of himself. Concomi- tantly, the transformative process of the yoga can now be understood to be, and can be in fact, energized by loving participation in the reality of God (bhakti), a participation which can be realized meditatively, but which can also be cultivated through song, poetry, and ritualized worship of God in images, or simply through dedicating one's whole self to God in every act one does (BhG 2.66; 4.10; 6.47; 9.22-34). The transformative process need not be understood as the stilling of the actual psychological self until the culminating, blissful intuition of brahman occurs. This more arduous method does not fail to bring a person to the divine person ultimately, but it is unnecessarily difficult and based on an inadequate understanding of the nature of things (BhG 3.1-8; 12.2-11; 18.1-12). So, as one must neces- sarily act-one is always implicated in action, even if one thinks one is renouncing action-and as one is, with everyone else, a part of a world which contains within it divinely sanctioned norms which conduce to gen- eral warfare, so one ought to conform to that pattern of action proper to one's own self, that is, by acting according to one's own dharma (svadharma).5 A person's ultimate perfection involves a radical moral sep- aration from one's natural reality, but that disengagement must occur within the context of, and in part through, being who and what one is in the world. The Great Bhdrata, the new Veda, the fifth Veda, directed to all members of society, was constructed as an almost ideal rhetoric for the presentation and inculcation of this new theological ideology. The Great Bharata powerfully motivates and dramatizes the basic ethical dilemma addressed by the Gita and exemplifies the ethical model revealed in the Gita. Questions concerning the nature and value of human action 5 This is an interpretation of the argument of the greater part of the Giti's third chap- ter (BhG 3.1-35), which recurs in the fourth chapter when Krishna describes the nature and quality of his actions, encouraging humans to imitate him.</page><page sequence="9">Fitzgerald: Great Epic 619 generally are examined repeatedly in the course of the narrative. Critical examinations of the central action of the epic, the war, occur just prior to the joining of the battle and just after it, and provide definitive resolutions of the problem posed by the war. But more than this, the particular actions which are called into question in the Great Bhdrata, and then strongly endorsed and carried out, are just those actions which are required for the establishment of the social and political order required by the Gitd's ontology. The Great Bhdrata provided a narrative recreation of this founding process which enabled the Indian populace to work through imaginatively the complex problem of the nature of the world as a locus of religious activity at the levels of the person and society both. The narrative developed in the Great Bharata is not a simple epic story of challenge, heroes, conquest, and a new beginning. In fact, it is not a rousing tale of heroism and triumph at all. The Great Bhdrata provides a mythicized epic account of the reinstitution of the lost integ- rity of a proper, dharmic, society. In the central myth of the Great Bhdirata this reintegration is accomplished through the virtually absolute annihilation of the social stratum of the Ksatriyas (the warriors, princes, and kings, who are charged dharmically with defending society from outside attack and maintaining dharmic order within it). The Ksatriya stratum of society is presented as having fallen into a condition charac- terized by divisive rivalry and spontaneously arising strife, which condi- tion threatened the survival of all earthly society based on dharma. The central narrative of the Great Bharata recounts the progressive polariza- tion of the entire royal Ksatriya caste and the annihilation of it through the great war which stands at the center of the text. The last third of the text describes the installation of a virtuous new king to preside over the ideal order which was now possible. A massive portion of the text here repeats a great corpus of religious instructions which the new king received shortly after his installation as king. The Great Bharata's narrative is simplified, and the power with which it presents the central ideology is intensified, by the skillful use of a kind of extended synecdoche. The pernicious fragmentation of the Ksatriya order is presented in the Great Bhdirata primarily in terms of the dissolution and polarization of the preeminent royal family of the ancient Aryan heartland of North Central India, the Bharatas. That is, the general situation of division and rivalry among the Ksatriyas is pre- sented and magnified by being stated in terms which were truly visceral in the ancient Indian context-the disintegration of the fundamental unit of society, the extended patrilineal and patriarchal family, the kula. The split in the Bharata kula occurred between two sets of cous- ins ("brothers"), the five sons of Pandu and the one hundred sons of Dhrtarastra, who eventually fought over the ancestral Bhdrata kingdom. The five Pandavas were in fact demigods, having different gods as their</page><page sequence="10">620 Journal of the American Academy of Religion fathers, though they were recognized as the legitimate sons of the Bharata king Pandu, and their eldest, Yudhisthira was entitled to the throne. Through an intricate series of events the five Pandavas were temporarily "exiled" from their kingdom and the great war ensued when they returned from that exile and demanded the kingdom back. All the Ksatriyas of the earth are then allied to one Bhdrata phratry or the other. As I shall show later on, this confrontation is charged even more highly, as the noble elders of the Bharata realm were bound by Ksatriya conven- tions to defend the Bharata realm against the PNndavas (MBh 6.41). The war was grotesquely patricidal as well as fratricidal. The action of the war, and its aftermath, was directed throughout by God himself incar- nate as Krishna. The five Pandavas, who were Krishna's, initially unwit- ting, agents, survived the holocaust, and Yudhisthira, the physical son of the god Dharma, inaugurated the new version of the proper order at the beginning of the new age. The Gita's primary ethical theme of karmayoga is very effectively presented and encouraged by the Great Bharata. Twice, once explicitly and once implicitly, the theme is developed in dialectical tension with other strongly motivated ethical ideals; twice, that is, at two supremely critical points in the movement of the action, immediately prior to and just after the great war. In each case the general narrative structuring of the episode is highly skillful and sophisticated, and the parallelism and eventual practical convergence of these episodes in the karmayoga ethic works as a powerful device calling attention to and emphasizing the central importance of that theme. The Great Bharata divides roughly into thirds, with the account of the war occupying 45,000 lines between the narratives of the disintegra- tion of the family and the foundation of the new order. The passages mentioned above bracket the account of the war and constitute two critical examinations of its ethical status. The first episode is the Gita and it departs from the doubt of the warrior Arjuna, third oldest of the five PNndavas. Arjuna was the paramount warrior of the Ksatriya caste, and the transformation of him into a karmayogin warrior creates a shining exemplar of the new ideal. The physical son of the god Indra (the mighty warrior-king of the ancient Vedic gods), Arjuna had been outfit- ted and armed with marvelous celestial weapons by various other impor- tant gods of the cosmos. Arjuna had been formed as the most skillful and intense warrior on either of the opposed sides, and yet it was he who hesitated and raised a dharmic doubt at the last minute before the war. Arjuna hesitated because he now saw his elders, his kinsmen, and his friends arrayed on the other side of the field. But Arjuna went further and generalized his immediate emotional horror into the argument that polarization and war within the family entailed the destruction of the entire society based on dharma, the proper norms. Arjuna proposed to</page><page sequence="11">Fitzgerald: Great Epic 621 withdraw from the fight and allow the other side to keep the kingdom. It was in response to this doubt concerning the general validity of the grotesque and societally dangerous action at hand that the Bhaga- vad Gitd was preached to Arjuna by his cousin, brother-in-law, friend, advisor, and charioteer Krishna Vdsudeva, ostensibly a prince of the Western tribe of Yadava Vrsnis. Krishna preached to Arjuna the doctrine of karmayoga, explaining its internal logic and basis in the nature of things and its superiority to the more prevalent but naive, nontheistic versions of yoga. Krishna revealed to Arjuna gradually, that he, Krishna, was himself the eternal, absolute reality, lord (isvara) of the entire cos- mos; and, pointing to his own divine action, he set forth the value action can have for the welfare of God's creation, and argued that there is no contradiction between action and the essence of yoga, which is the renunciation of individual, personal, desire-based interest in one's action and its fruits. He told Arjuna that he was now incarnate in the world in order to revitalize dharma which was nearly exhausted once again, and he exhorted Arjuna to conform to his Ksatriya body and mind and fight the war; to pursue yogic perfection in the course of acting, by acting without any personal interest in the actions or their consequences. He represented himself to Arjuna as the terminus of Arjuna's yogic perfec- tion and the proper source of all his motivation, and he granted Arjuna a vision of one of his divine forms, as all-destroying, all-consuming Time, into whose mouth all the Ksatriyas of the world were rushing. Imitating God's action and assimilating himself to God in bhakti, Arjuna ought now to do his dharma, acting as Krishna's human instrument in the critical situation at hand. Arjuna adopted Krishna's perspective, fought ruthlessly in the war, and slew elders, kinsmen, and friends. Largely through his efforts, the PNngdavas won back their kingdom. In the course of the eighteen day battle hundreds of thousands of warriors were slaughtered, indeed all the Ksatriya warriors of the earth except the Pandava Bharatas were annihi- lated. The theme of Soka, the burning grief experienced by the partici- pants, becomes progressively more prominent in the Great Bharata's account as events lurch to their final spasmodic climax. The narrative of the war ends with a particularly grotesque and harrowing set of inci- dents which came near to extinguishing the continuity of even the Bha- rata lineage and Soka becomes the major topos of the Great Bharata's postwar narrative. In this morbid context the account of the war is fol- lowed by another searching examination of the validity of these deeds- this time by Arjuna's eldest brother, the paradigmatically righteous ruler Yudhisthira. Yudhisthira was so charged with burning grief, Soka, in the wake of the war that initially he refused to take over the newly acquired kingdom. He desired to renounce the throne which had been won in his name and turn it over to Arjuna, while he himself wished to retire into</page><page sequence="12">622 Journal of the American Academy of Religion the forest to expiate the evil of the war and pursue moksa by cultivating the intuition of brahman (MBh 12.7). Yudhisthira's brothers and their common wife Draupadi were as- tounded and enraged at his hypersensitivity, and the six of them debated the issue up and down (MBh 12.8-22). Against Yudhisthira's urge to withdraw, his brothers argued that it had been his proper duty to wage war, even against his kinsmen and elders; that he personally had re- sponsibilities to the inhabitants of the Bhdrata kingdom; and that he had best pursue his ultimate perfection in the context of royal administration. Thematically, this passage is not explicitly coincident with the Gitla. Explicit terms of the Gitd's karmayoga occur here, but only sporadically, and there is none of the Gitil's theistic ontology. Krishna is present during this debate, but remains aloof from the argument until the end, and while this passage is a skillfully and powerfully wrought episode of the Great Bhdrata, it is not as rhetorically sophisticated as the Gitdi. Eventually Krishna spoke and he too told Yudhisthira to take the kingdom and rule it. To Krishna's word Yudhisthira assented and he and his party proceeded into the Bhdrata capital, where Yudhisthira was joyously received by all the people and installed as the Bhdrata king. So, effectively, the Great Bharata is ideologically centered in the karmayoga theme. Though these two examinations of the war are not conducted in terms of the same particular doctrinal themes and argu- ments, they address the same practical issues and converge on the same practical resolution. Not even the grotesque nature of the actions re- quired at that juncture of time impedes the necessity that Arjuna and Yudhisthira fulfill their dharma. The quality of the actions in question hardly functions to recommend the karmayoga doctrine directly; rather, these actions pose a limiting case which powerfully demonstrates the absolute value of doing one's dharma. But the grotesque narrative of the Great Bhdrata is more than an example of problematic action exaggerated out of proportion to test the depth of the karmayoga ethic. It presents and argues a view of society rooted in the theistic and monistic ontology with which the Gita accom- panies its presentation of the karmayoga ethic. As I described earlier, the Great Bhdirata presents to its audience an exemplary account of the purging of the earth of a fractious and undisciplined Ksatriya class, replacing it with a single virtuous king, the dharmaraija, the dharma- king, and his semi-divine family (which presents an image of the har- moniously integrated, tripartite Aryan society [Dumezil: 1:101-2]). This story is focused and intensified by relating it in terms of the disintegra- tion and restoration of simplicity within the Bharata clan. The first third of the Great Bharata is devoted to narrating the development of the fatal polarization in the Bhdrata family and the extension of that polarity outward to embrace all the Ksatriyas of the</page><page sequence="13">Fitzgerald: Great Epic 623 earth, drawn from all their various kingdoms. The account begins by presenting the genealogy of the Bharatas, a line which, in the genera- tions just prior to the events in question, had had great difficulty in sus- taining intergenerational continuity. The Bharatas had been forced to resort to a quasi-levirate because of their incapacity to produce male offspring. And when, in the generation of one of the phratries party to the disintegration of the kula, one of the Bharatas (Dhrtardstra) did suc- ceed in procreation, it was only in an extraordinarily grotesque manner that had the disastrous consequence of producing one hundred brothers who were innately wicked and given to strife. On the other side of the family, in the same generation, P.ndu was effectively impotent, and through that breach his branch of the Bharata line was infused with divine substance. Five sons were born to Pindu's two wives, sons fa- thered by five different gods, Dharma, VAyu, Indra, and the two Aivins. The narrative next shifts to relating the manner in which the Bhd- rata family dissolved laterally. The fault lay primarily with the eldest of the hundred wicked cousins of the Pdndavas, Duryodhana (who incar- nated the demon Strife, Kali). As Pandu had been the Bharata king, so his eldest son, Yudhisthira, should succeed him. The account proceeds, detailing the selfish treachery and viciousness of the hundred cousins, who eventually succeeded in depriving Yudhisthira of his kingdom tem- porarily, by means of a wager in the context of a dicing match. The emphasis throughout is on the jealous rivalry and scheming of Duryo- dhana, and Ksatriya institutions generally are depicted as conducive to such divisiveness.6 6 Salient instances of this depiction of Ksatriya cultural institutions are: Drupada's dis- avowal of his childhood friendship with the Brahmin Drona after he, Drupada, became a king (MBh 1.122) and Drona's resort to armed assault to avenge the insult (MBh 1.128); the display of martial arts staged after the martial education of the Bharata boys, at which the fissure between the Pgndavas and the DhWrtar~stras was publicly evident (MBh 1.124-27); the svayamvaras (a svayamvara is the "choosing for herself" of a husband by a young woman from the group of eligible suitors gathered for her inspection) of the prin- cesses of KMil (MBh 1.96) and of Draupadi (MBh 1.176-81); Yudhisthira's Rajasuiya-both the fact of his conquering many other kings and the ceremony conducted to sanction and acknowledge his domination publicly and religiously (the ceremony gave rise to dissension as it was conducted [MBh 2.33-42] and led directly to the complete polarization of the Bharatas by inciting Duryodhana's envy [MBh 2.43ff.]); the dicing match proposed by Duryodhana-both in Yudhisthira's obligation to accept the challenge to the match and in the actual match, which, after much dissension, culminated in the "exile" of the Pandavas in the wilderness and the irremediable polarization of the clan. Contentious statements and fractious behavior and manifestations of envy and jealousy occur at numerous other points in the text as part of the narrative's direct line of movement or as an accompani- ment providing harmony to the main narrative line. One interesting instance of such secondary "sympathy" is the episode of the "cattle expedition" (MBh 3.226-28), in which Duryodhana unnecessarily stages a cattle drive in the wilderness near the site of the Pindava camp in exile with the sole motive of having the Pi.ndavas observe his splendor</page><page sequence="14">624 Journal of the American Academy of Religion The spiral culminated in the war which reduced the polarity to the simplicity of the Pandavas alone, with Yudhisthira as king of the entire earth. When the Pindavas sought to gain back control of the kingdom, after the temporary exile brought on by the lost wager, the hundred wicked cousins refused, and all the Ksatriyas of the earth came from their various kingdoms as allies of one or the other party. It was when these massive armies faced each other for the battle that Arjuna won- dered that a fight within the family spelled the destruction of the entire society. This account has necessarily been much too brief to impart any sense of the horror and Angst surrounding the presentation of this disintegra- tion in the Great Bharata. But the particular actions of the war itself and the manner in which the authors structured their account of the war reveal the depth of the authors' loathing for the old Ksatriya culture. They reveal how profound was the sense they had of the radical social and political transformation which was required. The Great Bharata structures its account of the eighteen-day battle in terms of the killing of four leaders of the army opposed to the Pan- davas. The first of these men led the opposition for ten days before being cut down, the second for five days, the third for two days, and the fourth for one-half of the eighteenth day, when the battle proper ended. The Great Bharata's account of the war is contained in four large books (followed by one short one, which presents the special climax of the war narrative, the grotesque night raid of AMvatthaman), and each of these four books is named for one of these leaders of the opposition and recounts the events that took place while he led the army. The remark- able and grotesque feature of this structuring of the battle narrative is that each of these four opposed general commanders was a kind of father to the Pandavas. With regard to three of them, the Pandavas had a deep-seated affection, which was reciprocated. As to the fourth, though the Pandavas were unaware of the fact, the Great Bharata's audience is aware that he is the first-born son of Kunti, the mother of Yudhisthira and Arjuna. In killing him Arjuna killed his eldest brother. This brother was the third in the series of four quasi-patricides. The first involved the pseudopatriarch of the entire Bharata clan, a man who had always been celibate, but who presided over the clan and was addressed affection- ately by all on both sides as "grandfather." The second was the man who had taught all the Bhdrata boys everything they knew of weapons and while he would be able to observe their misery and gloat. (This enterprise backfired on Duryodhana as it led to .his unexpected humiliation before the Pndavas.) The general inspiration to consider the Great Bharata's narrative in terms of the theme of social and political division and integration comes to me from the work of Professor J. C. Heester- man of Leiden (Heesterman, 1964).</page><page sequence="15">Fitzgerald: Great Epic 625 fighting, the guru whose favorite pupil had been Arjuna.7 The fourth was a maternal uncle of two of the PEndavas. All four of these eminent warriors were bound to fight in opposition to the P~nd.avas by reason of bonds of allegiance forming part of the Ksatriya culture (MBh 6.41). They all fought strenuously and hard against the Pandavas, in spite of the strong attachment which all, except the unrecognized elder brother, had for the Pandavas. So, not only were the Pandavas called upon to reduce the fractious Ksatriya society to simplicity by annihilating all members of it except themselves, they were required to accomplish this gruesome purge by brutally killing the noble and beloved patriarch, the preeminent Ksatriya warrior of the old order, their beloved teacher, the discarded premarital son of their mother, and their mother's brother. Furthermore, in order to kill the first three of these "fathers," the Pdindavas had to employ, and did so at the insistence of Krishna, tactics which were, in one instance, devious and dubious, and completely perfidious in the other two-perfidious, that is, from the perspective of the accepted Ksatriya conventions of "chivalry." Krishna's animus against the conventions of Ksatriya society was so deep and his determination to install a simple new political order in place of that society was so great that he enjoined the P~ndIavas to "fight dirty," and they did. Violating established Ksatriya conventions of warfare and exploiting the allegiance to these conventions on the part of Duryodhana and his party, the Pnindavas succeeded in purging the earth of the agonistic Ksatriya society. It seems plausible that this narrative of social and political transforma- tion, and the vision of the social and political order on which it is based, was related in the mind of the creator of the text to political realities in North- ern India in the period after the rise of the Mauryan empire. This vision can be seen as providing an early Brahminic Vaisnava ideological ground- ing for an empire-whether as an unfulfilled fantasy, an imaginative pro- jection intended to inspire such action, or a retrospective justification for something already accomplished or attempted; and again, whether or not it was ever actually used to provide such a grounding by an actual political power-the Sufigas, the Guptas, or some ambitious or merely fanciful petty king sometime in between. In any case, the type of political integra- tion and subordination required to produce a harmoniously disciplined society and imperial state certainly must not have come easy to the imagi- nation of the old political elites of Aryan society, which were fractious and agonistic (Heesterman); and the Great Bharata provides a forceful argu- ment for the necessity of such a transformation, while suggesting, through its overwhelmingly powerful narrative, that great social cost was involved. Thus, the four quasi-patricides are not merely hyperbole; occuring within the familial metaphor which constitutes the heart of the Great Bhdrata's 7 The Sanskrit word guru can also mean "father" or "parent."</page><page sequence="16">626 Journal of the American Academy of Religion narrative, these killings would seem to demonstrate to their audience that the required annihilation of the old order involves the awful sacrifice of something cherished, fundamental to, and formative of, oneself. But how could such a monstrous narrative truly be imagined to serve as the rhetorical vehicle for an understanding of the world, society, and human action? How possibly could the Great Bhiirata be seen as effec- tively recommending or encouraging anything? Well, the vision of the four-caste society, and indeed of the whole order of being, as harmoni- ously integrated by the dharma emanating from a divine intelligence and superintended by a virtuous dharmic king who has been guided and assisted by that all-powerful, all-knowing divine person is a vision which appealed to long-standing Indian hopes for order, tranquility, and cer- tainty in life, and called upon deeply entrenched sensibilities to powers beyond the human-divine powers-and unity of cosmological vision. That is the vision the Great Bhdirata presented, and it called upon these hopes and invoked the theme of divine power often in developing it. The indictment of the old order which the Great Bhdirata made is strongly stated, and is virtually unassailable because of the assignment of divinity to the Paindavas and the assimilation of their wicked cousins to demons. The figures of authority and nobility in the old order appear to be helpless in the face of the divisive evil-the power of each of them is compromised in one radical way or another. And when the new order is presented as deriving from, authorized by, and in fact founded by the powerful God Ndrdyana-Visnu, the eternal, ultimate, all-powerful prin- ciple of the entire world, the new order he initiates cannot be opposed. On the other hand, the vision of what was required to pass from the fractious society to the integrated society is horrifying, and the Great Bharata suffered a hard fate because of that. The Great Bharata has been well preserved in all the regions of India, but it has been cherished primarily for particular pieces which could be extracted from the whole-the Bhagavad Gita, legends and accounts of battles, religious and philosophical passages, individual stories. And the narrative has been very little represented in Indian visual arts in comparison with other narrative sources. Moreover, the Great Bhdirata, as the Great Bhlirata, is not generally read in the home by orthodox Hindu people-it is read in public settings by groups, but not by individuals or families in their homes. The Great Bhiirata as a whole is regarded as an unsettling and inauspicious text. The Great Bhdirata was, and still is, the "great" epic of India, but the premier epic of India since about A.D. 500 has been the Ramiayana, a much brighter and simpler rhetoric for the same general ideology advanced in the Great Bharata. The Raima-yana took this ideol- ogy and its realization in a social and political order for granted, and the basic argument of the text is concerned with the nurturing of the social, political, and religious sensibilities required to maintain this established</page><page sequence="17">Fitzgerald: Great Epic 627 order. The Great Bhairata had undertaken the more difficult arguments of articulating a positive new vision of the human order and its divine foundation and of depicting the transition between an earlier order of society and polity and one more consonant with this ideology. It ex- pended most of its narrative energy in articulating the problematic nature of the past order and detailing the grotesque transition to the new one. Once the argument of transition was formulated, appropriated by its audiences, and superseded in Indian civilization by the static, exem- plary vision of the Rdima~yana, the grotesque details of the Great BhA- rata's epic narrative gave rise to a cloud over the Great Bhdrata. To some extent the integral unity of the text was obscured and its compo- nent parts came to have as much or more vitality than the whole. But the text lived on in its parts and in its weakened whole and continued to function as the full, comprehensive statement of dharma and salutary wisdom it was designed to be, though the epic narrative of transition came to function largely as mere setting and exemplum for the ethical argument and an intricately fascinating and thrillingly entertaining tale. As I noted near the outset, the Great Bhiirata sees itself as a tran- scendently important, comprehensive presentation of all knowledge important for the welfare of human beings. What I have focused on here as the major themes of the text's central argument-anthropomorphic mono- theism, the karmayoga, and the narrative account of the critical historical events in which these two themes were actually revealed by God and appropriated by some of the human protagonists, which account also con- stitutes a dramatic exemplum for these two themes and for the transforma- tion of the political order into a state consonant with the monotheism-are but a part of the whole, the central supporting shaft, as it were. Scattered throughout the text are numerous didactic narratives and expositions examining dharmic questions and elaborating upon one theme or another (such as the preeminence of Brahmins, the value of truthfulness, the origin of death, and so on, as well as themes bearing directly on the major themes of the text-fundamental metaphysical questions, the ethical tension between renunciation and life in the social world, the true nature and proper practice of yoga), and these generally function rhetorically in simpler and more straightforwardly didactic ways. At this level of its real- ity the text does not seek to present a precise and consistent statement of an ideology, but rather to comprehend "everything of importance" and to serve as a "library" of revealed dharmic knowledge (MBh 12.54.27-31). These episodes function integrally with the central narrative of the text (Fitzgerald, in progress) to fulfill the major general goal of the Great Bh~irata, which was to present the true dharma in a compelling and com- prehensive way that would provide the whole Indian populace with that knowledge and overwhelm and transcend all previous significant ideolo- gies and didactic corpora of India.</page><page sequence="18">628 Journal of the American Academy of Religion The result was a vast, awe-inspiring monument carved in words, which provided much of the Indian populace with a new ideology that did in fact incorporate and transcend the earlier "this-worldly" ethic of Brahminic ritualism and the renunciatory thrust of Jainism, Buddhism, and Upanishadic Brahminism and with an authoritative new corpus of dharmic instructions which might well have had the effect of appearing to be truly comprehensive to the vast majority of people, who were not steeped in the texts of a religious tradition. The creators of the Great Bharata succeeded marvelously in offering a new Veda to the whole of the Indian populace. They could have found no more appropriate rhe- torical medium for an ideology which strongly valorizes the material and social worlds as emanating from and structured by God and as being the primary loci of the most important human endeavors than an imagina- tive presentation through a narrative with the grandeur, sweep, and density of heroic epic. The narrative of the Great Bharata is actually quite an abstract, mythicized epic with stereotypical characters, but its unfolding of a dense and complex series of interrelated events across time drew its audiences into a vision of the world and people in which people are to act within the social world in imitation of and within the broader action of God. These themes have lived a long life in the imagi- nation and action of many Indians since, and they are very much alive in India still today. The Great Bhirata was not uniquely responsible for the vitality and continuing vitality of these themes-much, if not all, of it was synthesized from preexisting elements; it merely addressed, seized upon, a number of deeply entrenched popular sensibilities; and many of its themes and thematic elements developed and ramified in numerous different ways in the centuries following its creation and promulgation. But it was the first extended and elaborate expression of them, and in many ways it has remained the grandest and most imposing verbal expression of them.</page><page sequence="19">Fitzgerald: Great Epic 629 REFERENCES8 Biihler, Georg, and Kirste, J. 1892 "Contributions to the History of the Mahabharata: Indian Studies No. II."
