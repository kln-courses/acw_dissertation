Legal traditions from  centuries ago demonstrate human attempts to address conflict with the  2 natural world in a systematic way.  Despite a sense of powerlessness to  prevent devastation and accidental fatalities from chaotic forces of nature,  ancient and modern societies alike have created intricate legal processes for  resolving tension with the environment. Why?  Historians often posit that early efforts to impose law on animals and  other natural objects, like trees, reflect a need in society to find closure after  3 catastrophe or to exact vengeance after wrongdoing.  Medieval deodand  law, inspired by ancient near-eastern traditions, demanded full trials and  4 executions for non-human things involved in the death of human beings.   These proceedings were conducted at the expense of the local community  and included funding court-appointed attorneys who advocated vehemently  5 on behalf of their non-human clients.  This effort to provide non-humans a  place in the legal system and impose a human concept of order on the  natural world has been considered primitive and infantile in the  6 philosophical development of the law.  Early twentieth century scholars  mocked these legal practices as futile pantomimes reflective of superstitious  7 cultures.  But despite the apparent absurdities of deodand practice, the                                                                                                                                    1.

Recent developments in environmental law have found fresh  motivation for humanity’s initiative to find a place for ecology in our legal  systems: the preservation of our home. Today, we just as often find  ourselves abusers of the natural world as victims of it. Our growing  understanding of human impact on the environment has led us to reevaluate  8 our relationship as humans with other living members of the community.   In the last fifty years, American courts have entertained a variety of  proposals from environmentalists on the best ways to recognize and protect  9 the welfare of the natural world in our legal system.  The conversation of  the last few decades, however, has shown little consensus over proper  methods of litigating environmental interests.   Numerous legal and philosophical issues exist in the debate over how  10 the law should address human conflict with the environment.  While an  understanding of our interdependent relationship with nature has grown,  legally complicated standing requirements remain problematic in  environmental litigation. Satisfactorily answering (1) “[w]hose interests are  injured by environmental harm?” and (2) “[w]ho may properly represent  this injury in court?” has not proven an easy task for environmentalists.11  The lack of successful litigation on behalf of natural habitats and their  members has driven the environmental agenda to focus not on the human  interests at stake in the loss of biodiversity, but on granting legal rights to  12 various non-human species.  Instead of emphasizing humanity’s benefits  and responsibility for ensuring protection of natural resources, the present  discourse has removed human interests from the preservation equation,  forcing the environmental movement into a legally untenable position.                                                                                                                                     8.

A correct  understanding of humanity’s relationship to the natural world underscores a  premise that has been present instinctively in societies across the world for  many centuries: humans are responsible for providing sustainable legal  protection to the environment. This article suggests that, in the wake of  current challenges with environmental standing and litigation, courts should  appoint local counsel to advocate for the protection of non-human members  of the environment based on the human interests at stake in the preservation  of the natural world. For centuries, communities were obligated to  participate in trials and provide legal representation for parties in the form  of court-appointed counsel. These practices accurately demonstrate that  proper legal treatment of the natural world is the concern of local  populations.   Although the recent ecological conversation has centered on rights for  natural objects and the idea that environmental interests should be separated  from human interests, these propositions have diluted the correct  understanding of environmental responsibility. We need not attempt to  divorce the interests of the environment from those of humanity, because  humanity is utterly dependent on the preservation of natural resources.  Instead of isolating environmental interests in the name of pursuing rights  for non-human objects, counsel should be appointed to advocate for the  injury caused to local citizens by loss of biodiversity in the affected area.  This approach toward environmental litigation is best, because (1) it  acknowledges the responsibility of the human community to care for the  environment based on a sense of order common in legal history, and (2) it  best satisfies modern standing requirements for litigation, enabling effective  and sustainable environmental protection for the community.  I. A HISTORIC LOOK AT LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR NON-HUMAN  OBJECTS: COMMUNITY RESPONSIBILITY  A. Deodand Practice  In 1522, Bartholomew Chassenée began preparing for a trial that would  13 define his career as an attorney and later a French jurist.  A complaint had  been filed with the bishop’s vicar.14 Chassenée had been appointed defense  counsel for a group of nefarious community members and was to appear in                                                                                                                                    13. EVANS, supra note 3, at 18.   14. Id.    </page> <page sequence="5"> 2016] Rats and Trees Need Lawyers Too 109  15 ecclesiastical court to plead their desperate case.  Under threat of  excommunication for having eaten the barley crop of the province, the rats  16 of Autun had been summoned to court.   17 On the first day, the rats did not appear in court.  Chassenée argued  that their citation was insufficient; it had not been posted in the surrounding  villages where the rats were known to roam, and they likely had not read  18 it.  Finding this an acceptable defense, the court ordered that citations be  19 sent to the neighboring towns, so that all the rats might be notified.  After  another default on the part of his clients, Chassenée insisted that the rats  20 could not make the journey to appear in court for the perils along the road.   Dogs and cats might devour them on the way, and the rats were not  required to appear in court if they could not do so without risking their  21 lives.    Strange as this legal proceeding may sound, granting court-appointed  representation to non-human parties on trial was once a commonplace  practice under the law of deodand. This practice required that chattels  convicted by a coroner’s jury of causing the death of a human being be  22 forfeited to the king.  The word deodand was created from the Latin phrase  deo dandum, meaning “to be given to God.”23 If the item that was found to  be deodand was unable to be physically taken, its value was to be paid to  24 the crown by the owners, or if they were indigent, by the community.   Theoretically, this payment was to be applied for some pious use for the  25 good of the town.  However, the process of trying and convicting a  deodand was not a mere formality or a means to an end for achieving valid                                                                                                                                    15.

See id. at 16 (describing a case in which a man was killed by his own cart, a deodand,  and the price was allotted to his children, not by being heirs to their father’s estate, but because they  were likely to be needy and such use of the funds was sufficiently pious); Pervukhin, supra note 22, at  237.    </page> <page sequence="6"> 110 VERMONT JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 18  forfeitures. If a specific animal was charged with the crime of injuring a  26 human, it was often imprisoned alongside criminal individuals  until tried  27 28 by a secular tribunal  and, if convicted, hanged.  If a threat existed to the  community at large, as in the case of the Autun rats, the proceedings were  29 conducted in ecclesiastical courts.  In these cases, the defendants were  often vermin or insects accused of depleting a food supply and were  30 summoned to court to prevent continued destruction.  In both situations,  defense counsel was appointed for the accused parties at the expense of the  31 town.    32 While deodand practice reached its height in the early 1600s,  laws and  legal processes for dealing with offending non-human objects occurred far  earlier. Under the Laws of Alfred the Great of Britain, written circa 900  A.D., a tree that fell on a man and killed him was to be cut down and given  33 to his family within thirty days of the accident.  This practice was known  as “noxal surrender” and was not meant to restore the value of the lost life,  34 but was considered a ransom for the evil done by the tree.  Turning over  the wrongdoing chattel to the injured party prevented further legal action  against the chattel’s owners, because the offending “agent” had been  35 surrendered.  This idea of enacting legal punishment on an offending  36 natural object also appears in India.  The Kukis believed that if a man fell  from a tree and died, the spirit of the tree had caused the event, and the  wood must be cut up and spread across the land before the wrong was  37 properly rectified.  The Athenians publicly condemned weapons that had                                                                                                                                    26.

In 1591, a Russian  tribunal banished a bell to Siberia for having been rung in announcement of  39 a political assassination.  In China as recently as 1888, idols and corpses  40 were tried and sentenced to decapitation.  In American tradition, ships at  sea robbed of their cargo by pirates were condemned and sold without the  owners’ consent because the proceedings were “against the vessel for an  offense committed by the vessel.”41   These roots and remnants of deodand practice undoubtedly seem  eccentric in a modern context. The idea of putting a non-human thing on  trial appears perhaps as ludicrous as imagining rats avoiding a court  summons for lack of posted notice. Nevertheless, the earnestness and  longevity of this type of proceeding warrants a closer look at the  implications of deodand. What is really going on in society behind the  apparent absurdity?  B. Implications of Deodand  Deodand tradition was influenced most likely by the biblical practice of  42 stoning oxen known to have gored men to death.  These Judeo-Christian  43 laws can be traced to the Noahic covenant,  but similar edicts can be found  44 in the Laws of Eshnunna and the Laws of Hammurabi,  indicating that  legal regulation of human conflict with nature was a community goal that  45 transcended religion and culture.  Over time, laws addressing non-human                                                                                                                                    38. EVANS, supra note 3, at 172; see also Hyde, supra note 4, at 696 (noting that the  Athenians had a distinct court, the Prytaneum, for trials of murder cases in which the murderer was  unknown or could not be found, an inanimate thing had caused the death, or an animal had caused the  death).   39.

This sense of vertical structure in creation—with humanity at  the pinnacle—was clearly sustained in Western development and reflected  50 in early legal procedures concerning non-human parties,  but perhaps with  surprising results. The precision and importance evident in deodand  proceedings reflect an understanding of our complex relationship with the  environment, and our duty as humans to ensure justice and peace in the  community. Because they recognized human beings as supreme caretakers  of our natural surroundings, early legal jurists placed the burden for  ensuring functional and sustainable relations with non-human things on  51 local governments and legal systems.    Early criminal prosecutions of non-human offenders clearly reflect a  52 desire for vengeance after catastrophe,  but other motivations are apparent.  The language of deodand law emphasized wrongdoing when the object in  question had “moved to the death” in causing the accident.53 For instance, it  might be relevant whether the inanimate object or animal had shifted on its  54 own, or whether it was stationary during the calamitous event.  Any  movement was considered evidence of malevolence for which the object  55 could be held accountable.  While this search for volition in non-human                                                                                                                                    46.

In an effort to acknowledge the value and interests  of the offender and ensure a just judicial process, non-human defendants  58 were afforded the protection of legal representation.  Pronouncing and  enacting punishment on non-human offenders was taken very seriously, and  59 vigilante justice on the environment was not tolerated.  It would have been  far easier and more economically efficient simply to kill offending non- human parties. Instead, non-human members of the environment were also  entitled to legal protection, despite having violated human interests.  A mutual concern for the interest of humans and non-humans is most  clearly demonstrated by medieval ecclesiastical proceedings. When a  complaint was filed, an investigator was sent to examine the alleged  damage, usually to land or crops, and defense counsel was appointed to  represent the non-humans’ interest in continuance of whatever action had  60 caused the disturbance.  Defense attorneys, like Chassenée, took their role  as advocates seriously, employing a variety of legal strategies to vindicate  61 their clients.  In 1338, a complaint was filed in the ecclesiastical court at  Kaltern, Italy, against a swarm of locusts that were devouring crops and  laying eggs in the ground, likely causing continuous agricultural  62 devastation.  In a rather lengthy and dramatic speech, the locusts’ attorney  argued that the insects were only acting as God intended them to behave,                                                                                                                                    56.

Similar arguments were made in defense of weevils, moles, slugs,  and a wide variety of unsavory members of the environment that were  64 considered a public nuisance.   The remedy for these actions if decided in favor of the plaintiffs, as in  the case of our locusts, was excommunication from the land in question by  65 a given date, on pain of being anathematized.  Such a sentence likely   66 seems as rational to us as it was effective in its day.  Some jurists,  including Chassenée, who later served on the judicial assembly of the  Parliament of Provence, speculated about the authority and success of such  environmental censures, questioning human capacity and correctness in  67 cursing natural beings.  This struggle to resolve practical and philosophical  flaws in environmental legal proceedings reflects early legal thinkers’  understanding that settling conflict with the natural world was a serious  responsibility of the human community. Despite imperfections in the  process, deodand law required court-appointed counsel to make a case for  the environmental interests at stake when a conflict arose between humans  and the natural world.   C. What Happened to Deodand?  Notwithstanding issues of practicality and efficacy, deodand practice  remained part of English law until 1846 when it was abolished by  68 Parliament.  Was it some revolution of thought that put an end to legally  processing crises with non-human material objects? Not quite. With the  coming of the railroad came an influx of accidental human deaths, and  69 railway cars proved too expensive to condemn and forfeit to the state.   Other advances in the technology and machinery of the Industrial  Revolution led to numerous inadvertent deaths, compensation for which  70 would have jeopardized the financial stability of manufacturing markets.                                                                                                                                     63.

State officials feared that  forcing railroad corporations to pay the price of their cars for each death  72 resulting from train wrecks would bankrupt the industry.  The economic  disruption that was sure to follow led to a prompt dismissal of the entire  73 deodand practice.  Legal representation and due process for non-human  objects languished in the shadow of industrialization and, almost at once,  74 society began to consider deodand practice an embarrassing past pursuit.   In their move to eradicate the deodand, members of Parliament criticized  the practice for its absurdity and argued that it should have been eliminated  75 long before.   Although the practice of deodand has been described as “a childish  disposition to punish irrational creatures and inanimate objects, which is  common to the infancy of individuals,”76 there are hidden merits of the  tradition. As long as law has existed, it has attempted to resolve human  77 conflict with the natural world in an orderly and just manner.  Historically,  this meant sincerely-conducted legal proceedings, trials, and court- 78 appointed counsel for non-human members of the environment.  By  79 funding court-appointed representation for the offender  and possibly the  80 price of the deodand if it were condemned,  the law recognized that  regulating conflict with the environment was the community’s  responsibility. These laws are best understood not as products of irrational  minds, but as communal efforts to restore order when an imbalance had                                                                                                                                   (stating that the explanation for the abolition of the deodand “obviously lies in the socio-economic  conditions, particularly with respect to the revolution in industry and technology early in the 19th  century”).   71.

MODERN LAWS OF NATURE: ENVIRONMENTAL STANDING IN THE  UNITED STATES  A. Ideological Shifts  After the abolition of the deodand, legal prosecution of non-human  83 objects dwindled in Western law.  Instead of reacting to catastrophic  events in nature, the law began to perceive and address threats to the  84 environment by protecting ecosystems and conserving natural resources.   Although Western law had regulated the community’s use of common  85 resources since at least 1016,  judicial opinions for these restrictions  predominantly discussed the state’s police power86 and sparsely recognized  87 the merits of preservation of the natural world.  By the mid-twentieth  century, however, an ideological shift began to take place in the federal  government’s approach to environmentalism. In passing the National  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA),  Congress officially recognized the “esthetic, ecological, educational,  historical, recreational, and scientific value” of wildlife and plants.88 Part of  this newfound appreciation for the natural world included efforts to grant  legal “personality” to things other than humans, much like what had been  89 done already for corporations.  Although animal-interest activists sought  greater protection in the form of legal rights for individuals and species of                                                                                                                                    81.

Christopher Stone first posed the question, “[s]hould trees have  standing?” when he argued that elements of inanimate nature should be  granted legal rights in order to sue on their own behalf through volunteer  91 representation.  It was this article that inspired Justice Douglas’s well- known dissent in Sierra Club v. Morton, in which he stated: “Contemporary  public concern for protecting nature’s ecological equilibrium should lead to  the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own  preservation.”92 The central theme of this argument was that natural objects  had the capacity for legal rights in much the same way as a corporation or  even a fetus does, and as such, they should be legally recognized without  93 being tied to the interest of any human person.  Although Stone’s  arguments for legal rights for trees have never found their way into a  majority opinion from the Court, the decades since Sierra Club have only  94 seen an increase in litigation regarding environmental issues.   Unfortunately, environmental plaintiffs have struggled to effectively  95 represent the interests of nonhumans.  However, despite progressively  stringent standing requirements, the mainstream environmental agenda has  adhered to Stone’s proposition of “rights for natural objects,” ironically  96 stunting enhanced legal protection for the natural world.                                                                                                                                         90.

Where Do We Stand?  The problem of standing is at the heart of resolving legal issues on  97 environmental harm.  The law has long recognized suits over injury to our  98 common natural surroundings through the public nuisance doctrine,  but  who can bring such a claim in court? Stone argued that courts should allow  organizations to apply to represent natural objects and be appointed as  99 guardians with the ability to bring suit.  This premise relied on the legal  recognition of injury to the environment without an individual human  100 asserting a claim of harm against a polluter or other such offender.  To  date, however, courts have refused to grant non-human members of the  environment standing to bring suit on their own behalf, even with the  101 presence of volunteer counsel.   Since the United States Supreme Court denied standing to the Sierra  Club—acting as a representative of the public to prevent environmental  destruction for the development of a ski resort—private parties have  attempted a variety of strategies to circumvent the lack of standing for  102 natural objects.  According to Sierra Club, among other standing  103 requirements, the party bringing suit must be among the injured.  This  showing of individual injury has proven to be the most difficult element for  104 environmental activists to show during the litigation process.  Although  some government policies include citizen-suit provisions allowing for  105 private parties to enforce environmental regulations,  individual suits have  106 not been very successful absent a strong showing of economic injury.                                                                                                                                      97.

Not necessarily. Shortly after  the Court denied standing to the Sierra Club, it found that a group of law  students, together with the Environmental Defense Fund, had standing to  sue the Interstate Commerce Commission for failure to prepare an  environmental impact statement mandated by the EPA for a rate increase of  107 railroad operations.  The plaintiffs argued that the cost of recycled  material would increase, and their enjoyment of local forests and streams  would be diminished by the destruction of natural resources from the non- 108 use of the more expensive recycled material.  The Court accepted this  showing of injury and specifically noted that courts should not deny  109 standing just because many people suffer the same injury.   In 1995, the Ninth Circuit found that a county had standing to allege a  procedural injury for the United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service’s failure to  110 prepare an environmental document according to NEPA standards.  The  court agreed with Douglas County that the county’s lands might be affected  by the supervision of the neighboring federal property, and thus, its  111 interests were in the recognized zone of concern for the environment.   Whether the issue in an environmental case appears to be procedural (such  as noncompliance with federal regulations regarding paperwork) or  substantive (such as a threat to a species), courts stress the importance of  112 actual use and the existence of a geographical nexus to the affected area.   It appears that the judicial system is prepared to grant standing to a wide  variety of potential plaintiffs bringing suits for environmental harm,                                                                                                                                   vicinity” of an affected area), and Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 564 (1992) (stating that the requirement  for imminent injury was not met because plaintiffs did not demonstrate any specific plans to return to  the land in question), with Bennet, 520 U.S. at 167–68 (1997) (explaining that standing was met by a  showing of economic injury from a change in maintenance of water reservoirs).   107.

A few courts have  even declined to challenge standing sua sponte when species of the  environment themselves were named as plaintiffs and defendants did not  113 raise the issue.  In other words, when humans bring a cause of action  based on injury to their local environmental communities, courts have  treated this close relationship to the affected area as substantial in granting  standing to sue. Individual parties who regularly interact with local  ecosystems most effectively prove injury sufficient to satisfy legal  requirements.   A desire to increase individual awareness and accountability for human  impacts on the environment also can be found in legislative policies. From  the citizen-suit provisions of the ESA and NEPA, to the passing of the  Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act, environmental concerns have become  increasingly prioritized. Federal protocols have not focused exclusively on  the plants and animals of the ground but have extended to the skies in  regulating pollution of the atmosphere through Tradable Emission  114 Permits.  Efforts to understand and ensure a plan for maintaining a  healthy, natural world are present on the international stage as well. The  United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization created a  controlled ecosystem study known as “Man in the Biosphere” to better  observe the role of human impact in ecology and to develop and improve  115 ecological sustainability options based on the data.  In 1992, the  Convention on Biological Diversity adopted the Biodiversity Treaty,  recognizing an international focus on conservation of natural resources and  116 preservation of balanced ecosystems as global goals.   Despite this growing global sentiment for ecological responsibility, a  tension exists in the current environmental conversation. Because finding  appropriate legal representation for the environment has proven difficult,  environmental theorists have fixated on the need to separate the interests of  non-humans in nature from humanity and grant them distinct recognition  under the law in the form of rights. But, the language in legal debates  between human interests and interests of natural objects often sounds                                                                                                                                    113. See, e.g., Mt. Graham Red Squirrel v. Madigan, 954 F.2d 1441, 1447–48 n.13 (9th Cir.  1992) (stating that the court is not considering the standing of the Mt.

It is not hard to imagine that in any case where the  interests of the environment are pitted against those of humanity, the latter  will trump the former almost without exception. So, what is the problem in  the current conversation about the place of the non-human members of the  environment in the law? Many environmentalists have focused their  agendas on achieving “legal rights” for natural objects and have neglected a  more important and more challenging dialogue, implicating the interests  117 and responsibilities of the human role in the natural community.   III. THE DANGER OF DIVORCING COMMUNITY INTERESTS  A. Philosophical Motivations  Distinctions in the law between “personhood” and “thinghood” can be  118 traced back to Roman and Greek jurisprudence.  Beings that lacked free  will were considered res and not personae, indicating their property status  119 in society.  Things considered property were incapable of possessing legal  120 rights.  Roman tradition further designated some things as res communes  (things owned in common), which included the air, the seas, and running  121 water.  The idea that the natural world existed as community property  prevailed in the development of common law regarding nature as existing  for the purpose of human use and therefore, subservient to humanity’s  122 interests.  Undoubtedly, this perception skewed the language of early  judicial opinions to spend more words explaining the concepts of  governmental regulation and police power doctrine than our                                                                                                                                    117. See Favre, supra note 8, at 507–08 (arguing that rights for animals and ecosystems will  provide sustainable protection for the environment); Wise, supra note 1, at 544 (arguing that denying  legal rights to non-human animals is part of a primitive hierarchical worldview that hinders the  development of the law); Cormac Cullinan, Do Humans Have Standing to Deny Trees Rights?, 11  BARRY L.

This  anthropocentric approach in law that regarded nature as a collection of  resources for human use and management became known as  124 conservationism.   It was in reaction to this human-centered tone of the law that early and  mid-twentieth century environmental writers, like Aldo Leopold and John  125 Muir, began to talk about the ethics of preservation.  Preservationists seek  to shape environmental law and policy around the idea of ecological  equality, believing that nature exists for its own sake and humans are not  126 inherently superior to other living things.  Although not necessarily  dominant, this perspective greatly influenced the tone of environmental  legal ethics in the latter half of the twentieth century and directed the  mainstream environmental movement away from a conglomerate  assessment of community interests when determining the value of natural  127 resources.   B. What’s Wrong with Rights?  Ever since Stone argued for legal rights in the form of personhood for  natural objects, environmentalists have attempted to assimilate plants and  animals with humanity in a way that echoes the bizarre  128 anthropomorphization of deodand practice.  Stone analogizes the denial of  legal rights for natural objects to the once-unrecognized legal personhood  129 of children, prisoners, women, and racial minorities.  Recently, a converse  approach to expanding legal personhood has been attempted by arguing that                                                                                                                                    123. See Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U.S. 519, 522 (1896) (concluding that the solution to the  issue “involves a consideration of the nature of the property in game and the authority which the state  had a right lawfully to exercise in relation thereto”).   124.

Arguments for granting personhood to non-human animals often take on an  urgent feel and deny the efficacy of alternative proposals for enhancing  131 legal protection of the environment.   This strain of discussion presents serious philosophical issues that  confuse an already tangled legal situation and distract from the proper focus  of environmental policy. Despite exhaustive lists of similar biological  132 functions,  it is by no means commonly recognized in law or philosophy  that animals are as autonomous as human beings and should, therefore, be  133 granted personhood.  In fact, humanity’s rationality has long been  134 considered the dividing factor between mankind and the rest of nature.    In an effort to obliterate the longstanding notion of hierarchy in the  natural world, proponents of rights for natural objects employ a Darwinian  135 cosmology that blurs the distinction between humanity and other species.   But if we accept Darwin’s position that the difference between the  rationality of humans and other species is “one of degree and not of  kind,”136 137 the debate will merely refocus on varying degrees of autonomy,   which perhaps adds more levels in the pyramid but does little to create a  horizontal cosmology. It is virtually impossible to argue that all living  things exist at one level of autonomy and deserve equal protection under the  law. The impulse to reject hierarchy in environmental dialogue has  extended as far as arguing that there is “a logical duty to limit human                                                                                                                                    130.

That impulse has also likened the human presence on earth to that of a  pathogen, which the planet will exterminate by raising temperatures beyond  139 hospitable levels unless we become more symbiotic.   In law, the push for rights for non-human objects does nothing to  advance the goal of finding a way to provide increased environmental  representation in litigation that is both functional and sustainable. Although  many have advocated that the environment should be granted personhood in  140 the same way the law was willing to recognize corporations,  it is because  141 corporations are institutions of people that they have legal personality.  It  has been proposed that natural objects should be given rights but perhaps  142 not to the extent of recognized human rights.  One does not have to  ponder the concept of “limited rights” for the environment for very long to  find that there is hardly an articulable conversation to be had on the subject.  Should a river be granted the right to flow but not to flood? Should courts  recognize a tree’s right to grow and not be cut down but only if it remains  healthy or does not pose a threat to a human dwelling? If a tree is granted  rights, will it not also incur prosecutable liabilities and perhaps return us to  143 absolute deodand practice of old?   This line of thinking not only quickly leads to, perhaps, insurmountable  144 legal problems  but also, sadly, has distractingly diverted the  environmental conversation since first proposed in 1972. Very few other  proposals have received significant attention from the environmental                                                                                                                                    138.

Most  disturbingly, in our efforts to find the correct legal place for non-human  members of the environment, we may have forgotten our own. In this  attempt to reorganize a natural order perceived by societies across the globe  and structured in their laws for thousands of years, we have neglected our  role as caretakers responsible for our surroundings and lost a proper  146 understanding of the value of our home.  To be a tree is not to be human,  but perhaps, it is still something to be a tree.  C. Restoring Humanity with Hierarchy  In 1998, Ann Carlson offered a fresh perspective on the issue of  147 environmental standing.  In contrast to the negative view of most  environmentalists concerning the heightened standing requirements in the  148 wake of court rulings since the 1970s,  Carlson argued that the stricter  regulations would provide unanticipated advantages for environmental  149 plaintiffs.  Specifically, Carlson believed that a standing requirement that  focused on human injury would lead plaintiffs to show why environmental  resources deserved protection and would expand consideration of who is  affected by the degradation of those resources, which would inspire greater  150 environmental protection in time.    Because the issue of standing is one of jurisdiction and may be raised at  151 any time, including by the court sua sponte,  environmental plaintiffs  often make a weak showing of injury at early trial stages in an attempt to                                                                                                                                    145. See id. at 577 (arguing, based on the Coase Theorem, that allowing individuals to  purchase rights to natural resources in a form of free market environmentalism would increase  environmental protection).   146.

Id. at 933–34 (noting that most commentators regard the increasingly strict standing  requirements since Sierra Club as “damaging to the environmental cause” and have sought “either to  eliminate the central standing requirement that environmental plaintiffs demonstrate ‘injury in fact,’ or  to render the requirement essentially meaningless”).   149.

Id. at 936 (“Stricter standing rules could even lead environmentalists to think  differently both about who is affected by the degradation of an environmental resource. . . .

This strategy of alleging  general and seemingly unsubstantiated harm has neither yielded favorable  153 litigation results  nor enhanced awareness of the common goal of  154 humanity to protect natural resources.  It is Carlson’s position that  environmental litigation and law would be greatly enhanced by “a stronger  focus on the human relationship with the environmental resource at  issue.”155 Because this interdependence has been largely ignored and legal  discussion of environmental protection so often has pitted the rights of  humans against the interests or “rights” of natural objects, it has been  argued that there is “no shared, positive understanding of the human  relationship to the natural world” in the environmental movement.156   It is clear that preservationists, who advocate for rights for the  environment, and conservationists, who focus on human interests at stake in  environmental litigation, share a common goal of enhancing legal  157 protection for the natural world.  Nevertheless, the philosophical  distinction between the two streams of thought may prove important for  158 understanding the power of the connection between humanity and nature.   If standing were granted to non-human objects to sue in their own capacity,  what need would there be to present testimony at trials of human reliance  on natural resources? Even the citizen-suit provisions of the Clean Water  Act and the ESA, heralded as profound developments in environmental law,  do not require such showing of the value of the natural resource in question,  159 provided some satisfactory measure of human harm has been shown.   Embracing an anthropocentric approach to standing in environmental law,  however, forces plaintiffs to examine and explain the injury borne by  160 specific communities or individuals in the degradation of our ecosystems.   It is almost impossible that these efforts would not raise widespread                                                                                                                                    152.

For example, in 1973, a group of citizens brought suit under the ESA to  stop the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from constructing a dam in the  Little Tennessee River because damming the water would totally destroy  161 the habitat of a local endangered species, the snail darter minnow.  The  case drew heavy criticism as an example of environmentalism gone wild,  immortalized under the slogan “fish bites dam.”162 When viewed from the  perspective of “minnow interests” versus “human interests,” undoubtedly, it  seems impossible to find those interests equal, if even comparable. Less  discussed in the discourse of those who followed the case, however, were  the interests of the families in the Tennessee Valley who depended on the  163 river for watering farms, fishing, or recreational and esthetic uses.   Because it served as both a feeder and food supply for many species, the  absence of the snail darter would have caused a severe crisis in the local  ecosystem, as had already happened in other parts of the Little Tennessee  164 River.    Although later superseded by a congressional bill exempting the TVA  project from the ESA, the Supreme Court affirmed the injunction  165 prohibiting construction of the dam.  Sadly, mainstream media chose to  ridicule the case and its outcome as extremist environmentalism instead of  emphasizing the importance of biodiversity in the local ecosystem and  explaining the potentially devastating effects on the river and the human  166 way of life dependent on it.  In order to combat such skeptical social  attitudes, litigators should present a more compelling legal and moral  narrative by highlighting human interests at stake in the preservation of the  natural world instead of downplaying humanity’s relationship to the  environment in favor of inflating the proposed interests of non-human  167 objects.   Even accepting that a human-centered approach to environmental  standing provides the best long-term perspective on legal representation for                                                                                                                                    161.

Perhaps it was once fathomed that the national  government in the form of the Department of Interior would be capable to  168 protect public lands.  But that has proven to be an impossible goal, as  shown by federal policies that include provisions for citizen suits regarding  169 violations of environmental regulations.  Yet, individual citizen suits have  had limited success and have often failed to show sufficient injury for  170 standing requirements.    These failures to find sufficient standing have caused environmentalists  to hone in on Stone’s suggestion that interested private parties should apply  171 to courts to be appointed legal guardians for natural resources.  He  suggested that there would be no shortage of organizations willing to play  such a role, referencing the Sierra Club, Environmental Defense Fund, and  172 Natural Resources Defense Counsel.  In seeking to represent  environmental interests, however, national establishments have often failed  173 to provide sufficient showing of injury in the aftermath of Sierra Club.   Perhaps the quest for appropriate legal representation of environmental  interests can be answered by asking whose interests are being represented.  Focusing on natural objects’ interests in existing has led to currently  unsolvable legal issues and seemingly irreconcilable philosophical disputes.  But there are also human interests at stake. Whose? Everyone’s.  IV. WHY LOCAL COURT-APPOINTED COUNSEL BEST SERVES  ENVIRONMENTALISM  A. What Deodand Got Right  It would seem that modern environmentalism has brought us almost full  circle to medieval deodand practice in our efforts to color Western law with  recognition of our responsibility to preserve the natural world. While the  practical implications of some of the more extreme of these proposals  (granting legal personhood to trees) may rightly give us pause; perhaps  there is a reason we find ourselves returning to courts to iron out our                                                                                                                                    168.

What does deodand practice tell us about  how humanity sought to resolve conflicts with non-human objects in our  surroundings historically? It was the responsibility of the community to  174 ensure order and justice in the local environment through legal processes.   Not only were trial practices and penalties for non-human offenders  mandated by the law, but communal funds paid for court-appointed counsel  to represent the interests of the human complainants and the non-human  175 defendants.  Non-human offenders in the environment were not to be  punished without proper presentations of evidence, fair trials, and  176 substantiated convictions.  Humans were not permitted to bypass legal  177 processes for resolving conflicts with the natural world,  and defense  attorneys performed their duty to represent their non-human clients  178 earnestly.  However oddly these practices played out, it is certain that they  were an attempt to ensure that conflicts between humans and the natural  world were addressed justly, procedurally, and according to the  requirements of the law that applied to the entire community. These legal  traditions were based on a hierarchical understanding of the natural  179 world,  which viewed humans as rationally supreme caretakers  responsible for providing sustainable protection to the interests of the entire  180 community.   It is not coincidence that today the actions brought by local  communities of affected areas accomplish more through litigation than the                                                                                                                                    174.

Both county prosecutors and groups of community members have  successfully met standing requirements when suing for environmental  harm. Procedurally, this reflects the preference for a geographical nexus to  the natural resource in question so often stressed in judicial opinions  discussing standing since the 1970s and present in ecclesiastical deodand  182 proceedings.    When human interests propose to alter the local ecosystem in an  irreversible way, a case should be made for the interests of communities  affected by the loss of biodiversity or degradation of natural resources.  Many federal regulations already require proponents of industrial  183 expansions to conduct studies on estimated ecological impacts.  The  results of these studies should be carefully considered and debated before  decisions to jeopardize or destroy wildlife habitats are made. In many cases,  once the ecological impacts are understood, it is likely that interested  parties will petition courts to grant standing to sue for the imminent harm.  Germany has embraced this outcome with its Verbandsklagerecht laws,  which grant standing to organizations who seek to promote nature  184 conservation for non-pecuniary purposes.  But, it should not be left up to  volunteer counsel or national organizations to represent the interests of the  community in preserving the natural environment in these situations.  Instead, courts should appoint local counsel to represent the human interests  at stake in the loss of or abuse to the natural resource in question.                                                                                                                                    181.

The California Water Code allows the state attorney general to petition a  court to impose civil liability on citizens who violate the code’s provisions  concerning pollution and unauthorized discharge into communal water  186 systems.  Similarly, some states have begun to facilitate the idea of  localized environmental litigation by creating trust funds for the benefit of  187 non-human legal representation.  Legal efforts like these, recognizing  community responsibility to ensure environmental protection, remain our  best hope for restoring a correct understanding of the role of humanity in  protecting the natural world and sustaining a thriving ecology.  B. Sustainable Legal Protection for the Environmental Community  Because we are currently experiencing an increase in environmental  litigation, it is crucial that we understand our role as protectors and careful  managers of the natural world and that this understanding manifests in our  legal systems. The goal of modern environmentalism should be to enhance  the most effective and sustainable legal representation for ecological  injuries. Despite the trend of current environmental conversation, it is in the  best interest of environmental plaintiffs to focus on human interests at stake  in the loss of biodiversity in our ecosystems rather than seek individual  188 redress for the interests of non-human parties.  For example, scientists  who study climate change have argued that increasing individual awareness  of human impacts on nature is the only viable option for ensuring clean-air  189 sustainability and reducing atmospheric pollution.

The environmental laws and academic  commentary of the last thirty years reflect this common conception. With few exceptions the  environmental laws enacted since the 1970s have directed command and control requirements at large  industrial sources of pollution. . . . We are polluters. Each of us. . . . Industrial sources continue to be  major sources of pollution, and other important pollution sources exist, but individuals are now the  largest remaining source of many pollutants.”) Debates over effective measures to combat climate  change have, until recently, centered on restrictions for large corporations and apparent mass polluters.

The interests at stake belong not only to the current members of the  community who avail themselves of the esthetic, ecological, educational,  historical, recreational, and scientific value of natural resources but also to  future inhabitants who one day would do the same. In the summer of 2015,  Pope Francis released his encyclical letter, Laudato Si’, which focused  190 exclusively on the moral imperative of environmentalism.  Pope Francis  describes the responsibility to ensure functional human interaction with the  natural world as one common to all people as members of the human  191 race.  Thousands of years have passed since the earliest societies  instituted laws regulating the relationship of humanity and our  surroundings, and still we are searching for the best processes to maintain  order and justice in our ecological communities. Perhaps it is currently even  more essential that we understand our role and responsibility in  guaranteeing legal protection to the environment because lately we have  found ourselves to be masters of the natural world, quite capable of its  subjugation and destruction, and not so often victims of it.   CONCLUSION  Far from being a novel concept, wildlife and biodiversity have long  been considered an indicator of society’s attentiveness to environmental  192 stability  and have been afforded legal processes and protections for  193 thousands of years.  By recognizing the value of non-human members of  the environment and the connectedness of human interests to natural  resources, we assume our responsibility to care for the natural world and  afford the collective community a place under the law. By allowing court- appointed counsel to represent the value and importance of the non-human  environment to humanity, we are essentially litigating for our own posterity                                                                                                                                    190 .

And in the  process, we cannot help but extend legal protection and generate concern  for the other non-human members of our environmental communities, as  has been the habit and goal of the law in countless cultures over the  centuries.
