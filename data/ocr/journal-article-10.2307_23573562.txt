<plain_text><page sequence="1">A New Appraisal of Late-Medieval Theology In this ecumenical age we have thankfully seen the passing of polemical bitterness from theological discussion. We no longer seek first points of attack, but point of agreement and ways of interpreting the tenets of our separated brethren in the best light. Now when Christians look at the causes of their divisions they are readier to say me a culpa — if not on their own account, at least on behalf of their predecessors. Self-criticism is a healthy occupation, for theologians as for others, and in the new eirenic climate there is an added incentive for a criticai reexamination of the historical roots of our present disagreements. There are some, however, who do not sufficiently distinguish here between the field of conduci or pastoral practice and that of theological doctrine. Because ali agree that in the pre-Reforma tion Church there were serious scandals and corruptions in Church discipline and practice, some take it for granted that there must have been widespread corruptions and grievous errors in the field of Catholic doctrine as well. There is a temptation in this to find too facile a solution to our present doctrinal divisions by seeking in the past for theological scapegoats upon whom both sides can jointly lay the blame, without sufficient investigation to see whether the proposed solution is supported by documentary evidence. An eirenically intended theory flows from a persuasive pen and is eagerly copied by others; it gains currency and vogue; a tendentious label is attached to some group of men or trend of ideas; and there are the makings of a legend, or at least of a misleading over-simplification, which may survive in general usage even when it has been discredited by criticai scrutiny of the his torical sources. A signal example of such an unfounded legend concerned the theology of the eucharistic sacrifice. Until recently it was con fidently asserted in some quarters that the late medieval doctrine</page><page sequence="2">734 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. of the Mass had been corrupted by monstrous errors, because of which the Protestant Reformers, in righteous and radicai reaction, had to reject the sacrifice of the Mass as understood by the Cath olic theologians of the day. This theory, and the circumstantial allegations with which it was supported, evaporate into thin air when critically examined in the light of the evidence, and happily there are signs that this particular legend is now disappearing from serious theological discussionl. But there are other fields of late medieval theology where the issue is not so clear, and there is considerable scope for more accurate research into the schools of this period. NOMINALISM AS A SCAPEGOAT The pre-Reformation nominalists have been singled out for the harshest criticism. Their theology is held to be largely to blame for the disruption of the unity of Christendom in the sixteenth century. Protestant authors have echoed Luther's fìerce denunciations of the scholasticism he knew in his youth. An Anglican author has asserted that « the deadlook between Catholics and Protestants on the theological Ievel has been mainly due to their common inheritance of uncriticized, but highly criticisable, assumptions and thought-forms from the most insidious and vi cious, with its barren and spectral extrinsicism, was the nomi nalist outlook which had come to dominate philosophy and the ology alike »2. Some Catholic writers, too, have accepted the theory that nominalism bears chief responsibility for the Reforma tion schism. The Protestant Reformers, it is suggested, carried 1 In particular, it was alleged that the Reformers rejected the Mass because one or other of the following gross errors was prevalent in the pre-Reformation Church : I) that the Mass was a new redemption inde pendent of the sacrifice of the cross, and was needed to atone for ali actual sins because Christ's sacrifice availed only for originai sin; II) that the eucharistic sacrifice was a work the priest performed by his own power and merit, and forgave sinners in a magical manner without need of faith, repentance or good dispositions on their part; III) that the Mass was a new daily mactation, causing Christ to suffer and be slain afresh at the aitar. These now discredited allegations and their origin, together with the real reasons for the Reformers' rejection of the Mass, are fully discussed in my Eucharistic Sacrifice and the Reformation, London and Westminster (Md.) 1960 (referred to in the following footnotes as E.S.R.). 2 E. L. Mascall, The Recovery of Unity, London 1958, p. 91.</page><page sequence="3">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 735 out their religious revolution partly in justifìable reaction against the corrupt and uncatholic doctrines of nominalist theology, partly because they themselves were unwitting victims of corrosive nomi nalist principles which they had imbibed from the contemporary schools and which seduced them into rejecting some traditional Catholic truths. Thomists of course (myself among them) find the nominalist outlook and system unsympathetic and unsatisfactory ; but for that very reason we should surely wish it to be fairly and seriously studied, and not caricatured. The odium theologicum can darken counsel, even at the level of scholarly discussion, and there is a tendency in some quarters to go to extrems in denigrating schools and opinions not in current favour. It is as true in the study of Christian thought as in other fields of scholarship that the liberal mind, in the truest and best sense, belongs not to those who are shrillest in denouncing minority or unfashionable opin ions, but to those who are able to judge calmly and generously even what is foreign to their own sympathies, who are able to appreciate the virtues and values, as well as the faults and weak nesses, of thinkers and trends of thought whose day seems past and whose popularity has waned. Nominalism, as a speculative system, has few defenders among Catholic theologians today; and ali agree that it had its defects, greater or less. Consequently those who cast about for a scape goat on which both Catholics and Protestants may jointly lay the blame for the rending of Christendom's unity in the sixteenth century see nominalism as apt for their purpose. No need, it would seem, for tedious sifting of evidence, for a protracted hearing or trial; let nominalism be impeached and condemned by common consent, in the name of ecumenical amity. To judge from the weight of opprobrium heaped upon the nominalists by certain writers, they were men who, having gained complete con trol of Catholic thought and teaching in the pre-Reformation age, proceeded to distort ali the doctrines of Christianity ; who forsook the Scriptures for mere human sophistries, turning away from the true Catholic tradition; men who preferred logie to meta physics and mere irrational fideism to theology; men, in fine, who undermined ali truth, human and divine, by a sceptical positivism. Unfortunately, the recent writers who have popularized these sweeping condemnations of late-medieval theology, and of nomi nalist theology in particular, have not based their strictures on</page><page sequence="4">736 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. firsthand study of the sources. Some have assumed that because there were recognizable defects in the Ockhamist speculations about individuai questions (in particular, about the process of justification), that therefore the nominalists must have fatally dis figured whatever dogmatic truth they touched. Others have un critica'ly accepted at their face value the polemical assertions of the sixteenth-century Reformers and their successors about the Catholic theology which they had rejected. A German Protestant historian has justly remarked : « For a knowledge of the theology and church life at the end of the middle ages, the writings of the Reformers can hardly be used even as secondary sources »s. A NEW MAJOR STUDY Ali the more timely, then, is the publication by a distinguish ed Protestant scholar of a new work of detailed research into the theological source documents of that period. It is The Harvest of Medieval Theology4, by Heiko Augustinus Oberman, who is Associate Professor of Church History at Harvard Divinity School and one of the Observers for the International Congregational Union at the Second Vatican Council. He has carried out a painstaking analysis of the theology of Gabriel Biel, one of the most influential figures in pre-Reformation nominalism, whose works were held in high esteem at the time. They were well known to Martin Luther and to many of the early Reformers, as well as to their Catholic opponents. The stature and prestige of Biel at the end of the fifteenth century can be judged from the fact that the Ockhamist nominalists at that time were often called simply « Gabrielists ». Although on certain cardinal points I must make reservations, this work is undoubtedly a major contribution to the study of late medieval thought, and is one which will have to be taken into account by ali scholars working in this fìeld. The author has submitted Biel's writings to a meticulous examination, including 3 Τ. Kolde, Die deutsche Augustinerkongregation, Gotha, 1879, ρ. VI ; cf.

He has accurately studied and summarized the facts ob Biel's curriculum vitae, and has taken care to place Biel's opinions in their theological and cultural setting. In his comments on the speculations and disputes of the pre-Reformation age, Dr Oberman shows a serene scholarly interest and much shrewd in sight. It is refreshing to find how consistently he examines his subject afresh, refusing to allow his judgement to be pre-condi tioned by the hitherto accepted clichés and generalizations, or by the prejudices either of Protestant or of Catholic critics of nominalism. In an epilogue to his book, entitled « The Catholicity of Nominalism », he is able to say : « Throughout this study we have had the opportunity to show that the often-asserted thesis of ' the disintegration of late-medieval thought ' proves to be un tenable. It is precisely to cali attention to this fact that we have chosen as our title 'The Harvest of Medieval Theology ' ». In the course of his researches Dr Oberman has cut through a thicket of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, and on sev eral important questions has ably vindicated Biel's theological con sistency and Catholic orthodoxy. Even though on certain other key questions his interpretation is less successful, high tribute must be paid to his objectivity and to his sincere endeavour to be just even where he disagrees. One instance of ' the way in which Biel's thought has been misjudged in the past by hostile critics can be seen in the inter pretation of his often-used distinction between the divine potentia absoluta and potentia ordinata. Some have supposed that this was a clever nominalist trick employed by Biel in order to put forward his own unorthodox views in the hypothetical sphere of what God might do, de potentia absoluta, while taking care to pay lip service to officiai teaching in what it laid down about God's dea'ings in the existing order, de potentia ordinata. Accord ing to this interpretation, « As a grudging concession to eccle siastical authority, every statement Biel would really like to make de potentia ordinata is made de potentia absoluta in order to evade and forestali inquisitorial interference ». Thus it is alleged by some critics that, « while nominalism erected two virtually in dependent and even mutually exclusive systems, one should take 3 — tGregorianum » XLVI (1965) Voi. XLVI.</page><page sequence="6">738 FRANCIS CLARKj S. I. the system de potentia absoluta as the only true measure of the theology of nominalism » 5. In a penetrating yet concise chapter Dr Oberman shows how foreign to Biel's real mind was such a Janus-faced theology. He brings out well Biel's prime concern for the historical events of revelation, and his insistence on the concrete situation of homo viator standing under God's mercy and justice. Biel's use of the distinction potentia ordinata and absoluta (which was not, of course, originated by him but had long been common in the schools), shows that he took it not merely as a philosophical canon to delimit the boundaries of faith from those of reason, but also as a means of expressing the sovereign freedom of God's merciful designs in the Christian economy of salvation. « Except for the events leading up to and connected with ' the last things the potentia ordinata is concerned with past events which shaped the present — creation, preserva tion, fall, and redemption. Explicit faith grasps the mean ing of these events and accepts them as meaningful. This explicit faith has as its object the order de potentia ordinata and can therefore be qualified as an historic-positive faith in the sense in which we speak of positive theology in con trast to speculative theology. ... It is important to note that the nominalistic emphasis on the truly historical nature of God's dealings with his creation postulates the unpredicta bility but not the arbitrariness of God's actions. The best illustration is perhaps to point out that in the tempus legis naturalis, the pre-mosaic period, God's actions in the tempus legis Moysis could not have been predicted by human reason, nor in this latter period the events of the tempus legis gratiae. Under the revealed and stable conditions of this last era, the viatores will live until the end of the world. » " Biel's preoccupation with God's potentia absoluta and ordi nata was, then, neither the subterfuge of a crypto-heretic nor the mere word-spinning of an over-subtle schoolman who had lost touch with reality in a cloud-land of artificial hypothesis; it was a framework of theological thought intended to show forth the inscrutable freedom and holiness of God's omnipotent will, and the wholly gratuitous condescension of his mercy in revealing 5 Oberman ρ. 31. 6 Ibid., ρ. 39-40.</page><page sequence="7">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 739 himself to his people and in saving them through Christ. As I have pointed out elsewhere 7, it is this that explains why the pre Reformation via moderna appealed to so many men of deeply religious mind, who would have been repelled if it had been no more than otiose philosophical theorizing or mere logicai juggling with terms and concepts. For men like John Gerson, Peter d'Ailly and Biel himself, the voluntaristic theodicy of the moderni was seen not as a retreat to arbitrariness and agnosticism in theology, but as an evangelical reaction against the influence in Christian thought of the necessitarian doctrine of Graeco-Arabian philos ophy, which would reduce the omnipotent God of revelation to a metaphysical principle, acting with inexorable necessity accord ing to an eternally determined pattern. They saw their movement as a reform of theology, in which the all-pervading norm was the revealed word of God, as authentically interpreted by the Fathers and the tradition of the teaching Church. THE ORTHODOXY OF GABRIEL BIEL It is failure to appreciate this primary framework of the thought of Gabriel Biel and his colleagues that has led later writers to misjudge the purpose of their metaphysical speculations and to suspect that they must have corrupted ali Catholic theology. Whatever may have been the philosophical weaknesses of nomi nalism, there can be no doubt of the wholehearted concern of Biel and the « Gabrielists » for orthodoxy in dogmatic theology ®. Throughout Dr Oberman's book there is convincing evidence of Biel's consistent and unreserved adherence to Catholic orthodoxy as the ruling principle of his theology. So too the author effec tively clears Biel from the accusations of moral positivism, and is able to conclude : « It is quite evident, therefore, that the often-repeated charges — despotism, decisionism, positivism, and ethical relativism — made against the ethics of nominalism, here represented in Biel's ethics, are absolutely without founda tion. No lines can be drawn easily from Biel to the Age of Reason, Deism, and Enlightenment ; Biel's God is not 7 E.S.R., chapter 14, especially ρ. 309-310. « E.S.R., ρ. 310-312.</page><page sequence="8">740 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. a deus otiosus, nor is naturai law for him merely the har mony of a mechanized cosmos. Furthermore, ali efforts to show in this connection that Gabrielistic nominalism is re sponsible for the ' disintegration of the Middle Ages ' must collapse in the face of the indisputable evidence of Biel's basic adherence to the general medieval concepì of the divine basis of naturai law ». 9 In a study of this nature it is almost inevitable that some parts should prove vulnerable to criticism. In limiting himself to a thorough-going exposition of Biel's theological ideas, with some comparative reference to the wider context of nominalist thought, Dr Oberman naturally cannot trace the parentage of ali the ideas he discusses. Consequently readers who are unfamiliar with the medieval theological background will not always be able to distinguish, on the one hand, the particular theories and at titudes which Biel derives from the system of the via moderna, and, on the other, the general patrimony of medieval Catholic theology which he faithfully hands on. Indeed, since for such readers this book may well be their first detailed acquaintance with pre-Reformation scholasticism, some may even form an exag gerated estimate of Biel's stature as a thinker and a theologian. Certainly the Tiibingen doctor was renowned in his age for the clarity and solidity of his teaching and methodology, but in sub stance his work was no more than an able and coherent com pendium of the traditional dogmas and a selection from the specu lative opinions of the chief schoolmen. He made no originai con tribution to theology. « Because Biel is a shrewd eclectic », wrote Mgr Ruch, « because he sets forth so well the ideas of others, we can say that we hear in him the voice of almost the whole of scholasticism »10. From Dr Oberman's sympathetic survey of a coherent teach ing which is ri eh with jewels of sacred wisdom, the impression could be gained that Biel was a theologian of the first rank; whereas the jewels were not of his own finding and cutting, but were well-known heirlooms, the common heritage of the Church. Biel has a truly Catholic sense of Scripture and patristic tradi tion, and his chief care in matters of faith is to determine what God has revealed. When he comes to the speculative elaboration 9 Oberman, ρ. 110. 10 Quoted in E.S.R., ρ. 82.</page><page sequence="9">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY ' 741 of revealed truth, he lays under contribution ali the main medieval schools : not only Ockhamism, the school of his predilection, but also Scotism, Thomism and Augustinianism, the collections of the canonists, and other similar works. In disputed speculative ques tione he usually favours the Scotist and Ockhamist positions rather than the Thomist; but he knows well and respects the great thir teenth century schoolmen, not only the Franciscan doctors, Alex ander of Hales and St Bonaventure, but also and especially St Thomas Aquinas. Within the pale of dogmatic orthodoxy there is, and has always been, a wide field for free discussion and theological speculati on. To speculate unprofitably, or to advance views which later doctrinal development will discredit, does not make a man a heretic. Like many other theologians before and afterwards, Biel and his colleagues put forward opinions and theories that have not stood the test of time. Solidly orthodox in his adherence to dogmatic truth and the teaching authority of the Church, Biel shared the intellectual shortcomings of his age, and especially of the nominalist philosophical method. In the light of later doc trinal development, some school opinions which in his age were stili theologically tenable, have been see'n to be inadequate and have been generally modified or abandoned. It is against this background of Biel's habitual orthodoxy and moderation that we must judge his opinions in that particular field where they are most criticized — namely, in his doctrine of justification and salvation. And this is one of the two cardinal questions on which, regretfully, I have to make my main adverse criticisms of Dr Oberman's otherwise valuable study. The sécond is in his treatment of Biel's Mariology, about which I must say more later. At these two « neuralgic points » the author's sym pathetic understanding of his subject falters and his conclusions fail, THE CHARGE OF PELAGIANISM Biel's doctrine on justification and salvation is discussed in three key chapters of the book : Chapter 5, « Man fallen and redeemed » ; Chapter 6, « The process of justification » ; and Chap ter 7, « Between hope and fear : the riddle of predestination ». Dr Oberman's general interpretation is forthright. « It is evi dent », he concludes, « that Biel's doctrine of justification is es</page><page sequence="10">742 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. sentially Pelagian » (p. 177). In many different passages he repeats and amplifies the same radicai criticism. Now I am not concerned to defend details of the nominalists' theory about the process of justifìcation, which, as J. Brinktrine says, « ist heute antiquiert ». What I do think requires closer examination is the assertion that is was in essentials equivalent to the Pelagian heresy. Dr Oberman nowhere defines what he means by « essentially Pelagian ». This is an emotive term, which had already been put to vigorous polemical use in the later Middle Ages. Thomas Bradwardine, for instance, ultra-Augustinian and rigidly predes tinarian in his own ideas on grace, considered that most of his contemporaries were « Pelagiani pestiferi ». Gregory of Rimini, another pessimist in his views on the intrinsic corruption of fal len nature, said more mildly that the doctrine held by « many modem authors » favoured Pelagian error. The Protestant Re formers, of course, commonly denounced their papist opponents as Pelagians. And the epithet « Pelagian », or « semi-Pelagian » was again freely bandied about as a term of abuse by some op ponents of the Jesuit theologians and their allies 'in the disputes de auxiliis at the turn of the 16th century, as well as by the Jansenists in the 17th and 18th centuries. Historically and theologically, the basic tenets of Pelagius and his followers, or at least of the Pelagian heresy as condemned by the Church, can be summarized under the following three propositions : 1) Adam's sin injured only himself, so that his posterity were not born in that state of alienation from God called originai sin. (2) It was accordingly possible for man, born as he was without originai sin or its innate consequences, to continue to live without sin by the naturai goodness and powers of his nature ; therefore « justifìcation » was not a process which must necessarily take place for man to be saved. 3) Eternai life was, consequently, open and due to man as a result of his naturai good strivings and merits; divine interior grace, though useful, was not necessary for the attainment of salvation. If one examines fairly (and indeed Dr Oberman himself amply provides the evidence for such an examination) the teach ing of Gabriel Biel on each of those basic points, it is clear that he cannot be accused of the Pelagian heresy, but rather that he expressly excludes it. The subtle medieval speculations — like the post-medieval and modem speculations — on the nature of</page><page sequence="11">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 743 originai sin, left much room for manoeuvre within the bounds of traditional orthodoxy. Biel's own teaching on this question is adequately analysed by Dr Oberman (Chapter 5, part 1) ; but from this very analysis it clearly appears that Biel must be ac quitted of any suspicion of siding with the Pelagians in denying the fact of originai sin and the consequent reality of man's aliena tion from God. In common with ali Catholic theologians, he accepts without question the necessity of justification for the viator by divine grace if he is to be saved. Indeed he is con stantly preoccupied, both in his scholastic works and in his ser mons, with this decisive event of justification, to which the con science of sinful man must be urgently directed. Far from neglecting the necessity of God's grace for salva tion, Biel makes this truth centrai in his theology. In the econ omy revea'ed by God, the bestowal of the habitus of divine grace is essential both for true merit and for salvation. If a man by any naturai strivings could produce justifying grace in himself, it would follow that he could be saved by his own mere naturai powers ; and this, Biel reminds his hearers, « is the error of Pelagius » : « Siquidem ex operibus nostris grafia adquiri non potest, sicut ceterae virtutes morales quae ex operibus moraliter bonis frequentatis in nobis naturaliter generantur,... [grafia] a solo Deo est, cum natura de nihilo nihil facere possit. Si denique ex creatura esse possit grafia, cum grafia illa sufficit ad salutem, posset aliqua creatura ex suis naturalibus salvari, illa scil. quae gratiam producere posset, quod est error Pelagli ».11 Dr Oberman reproduces this passage, as well as several others which show clearly enough how firmly and unambiguously Biel rejected the Pelagian heresy. Because it is a revealed truth that man cannot be justified before God without the gratuitous be stowal of this divine gift of grace, a fortiori he cannot reach eternai life without it. At the same time Biel gives due place to the complementary truth of Catholic faith, namely that be cause of God's grace the justified man can by his good works truly merit his eternai reward. Even here, however, he strongly 11 Sermones de festivifatibus Christi, 14 C; quoted by Oberman, p. 166, note 64.</page><page sequence="12">744 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. asserts the complete gratuity of the reward, depending on God's freely covenanted acceptance of man's good works. The just man's merits fall incomparably short of the eternai recompense, but they are nevertheless accepted and crowned by God in his sovereign bounty. In this the nominalists took a more restricted and severe view of human merits than the Thomists. In the Thomist doctrine there is a true intrinsic proportion and a kind of analogical condignity between the grace-informed acts of Christ's mystical members and the final glorious consummation which they merit. For Aquinas the good works of the just are so elevated and quasi-divinized by the grace of Christ that they bear an intrinsic relation to their reward in heavenly beatitude. For Biel this intrinsic proportion between the merits of the just and the heavenly reward necessarily fails; the gulf is spanned only by the generosity of the divine acceptance : that is, by the gracious decree by which, in the present economy of revelation, God has pledged himself to link human merits with the eternai reward : « Non requiritur ad praemium de condigno quod actus me riti secundum intrinsecam suam bonitatem sit condignus seu proportionatus tali praemio. Alioquin nullus actus tempo ralis esset aeterno condignus praemio. Sed illa condignitas attenditur in proposito ex divina acceptatione qua ab aeterno voluit actum sic ex grafia elicitum esse dignum tali praemio, incomparabiliter excedente actus bonitatem secundum se sine acceptatione divina consideratam. Et secundum haec verum est quod Deus semper praemiat ultra condignum.... Sic ergo patet quod debitum iusticiae in praemiando... [innititur] divinae ordinationi quae est quaedam promissio, sive conven tio et pactum ».12 If then one uses the term « Pelagian » in its proper histor ical and theological sense, it is evident that Biel cannot be con victed of teaching an « essentially Pelagian » doctrine of justifica tion, salvation and merit. And since Dr Oberman himself cites abundantly the evidence which aquits Biel of the Pelagian heresy, he cannot really intend to maintain that accusation.13 Rather, 112 II Sent. d. 27, qu. 1, art. 1, nota 3C; quoted by Oberman, p. 168, note 69. I have standardized the spelling 13 He does in fact soften it on p. 426, where he says that the nomi nalist doctrine is « at least semi-Pelagian ».</page><page sequence="13">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 745 it seems that he is using the term in a particular sense, according to systematic presuppositions which he has perhaps not sufficiently examined. He does, indeed, admit that Biel has a clear and sys tematic doctrine of iustificatio sola grafia; but this he dismisses as « a rational outer structure ». In « the message preached and taught by the Church », as evidenced especially in Biel's sermons, he considers that Biel's emphasis is on iustificatio solis operibus, and that this is the true « inner structure » of his theology of justification.li The same is alleged of Usingen, Biel's celebrated disciple and Luther's teacher. It is true that Usingen insists : « Righteousness and salvation are from God alone and are due to his grace alone and not to merit ». Such words will not satisfy Dr Oberman : « On closer consideration it becomes clear, however, that such passages refer only to what we have called the outer structure. Usingen distinguishes, as does Biel, between bo~ nitas and dignitas. As far as the dignitas is concerned, salvation is unmerited; but God has obliged himself to ac cept man's virtuous acts. Man provides the substructure, the substance of the act; its meritoriousness is a gift of God ».15 And so Dr Oberman concludes : « Usingen is a true disciple of Biel with respect to the doctrine of justification : seen from different vantage points, his doctrine is at once sola gratta and solis operibus. Its core and inner structure, however, is clearly Pelagian ».16 There appears to be some question-begging in the argument which leads to this conclusion. If one redefìnes Pela gianism, so that it means the free co-operation of the human will with grace, then Biel's theology and ali Catholic theology is Pelagian. It one takes it to be Pelagian to hold that even after the Fall man's nature remains capable of producing « the sub stance of an act » which is good in itself, then again not only nominalism but the officiai teaching of the Roman Catholic Church must be branded as Pelagian.17 But such tenets were not the *enets of Pelagius condemned by the Church in the fifth century; nor were they the tenets of the semi-Pelagians rejected by the 11 Oberman, ρ. 176-178. 15 Ibid., ρ. 179.

(second) provincial council of Orange in 529, whose canons were approved by Pope Boniface II. CONTROVERSIAL PRESUPPOSITIONS It is indeed legitimate to criticize the nominalist theory of justification and merit as artifìcially contrived, as an attempi to circumscribe the mysterious rea'ities of the supernatural life in categories which were too narrow, superficial and academic. But it is also necessary to distinguish between secondary objections, which may rightly be brought against defects in Biel's theories, and unfair accusations that he fell into heresy. Protestant con troverialists have always presented pre-Reformation theology as Pelagian, in order to justify Luther's radicai protest, but the time has come to look more carefully at the dogmatic presup positions behind such charges. A balanced judgement of Biel and his fellow schoolmen will take into account the shortcomings of their speculations about justification, and the defects of their terminology; but it would be quite unreal to fìnd in these the reason and justification for the radically new theology of the Reformation. None of the defects discernible in Biel's theories provoked the new doctrines which were to be basic in Luther's system — his conviction of the total depravity of fallen human nature and his revolutionary understanding of justification by faith alone. It is, of course, an old complaint against the Ockhamist nomina'ist schoolmen (as also against the Scotists and the Jesuit post-Reformation theologians) that they unduly exalted the powers of fallen human nature. In particular, it is their theorizing about the meritum de congruo of the yet unjustified sinner that has excited the sharpest criticism. In this discussion it is not the Pelagian heresy that is relevant, but the much milder error of those monks of southern Gaul and others in the 5th and 6th cen turies, who were later called the « semi-Pelagians ». These ac cepted without question the Church's condemnation of Pelagianism, and held the orthodox doctrine that without divine interior grace man could neither reach eternai life nor be justifìed. But in incautious reaction against what they regarded as the arbitrari ness attributed to God in the Augustinian teaching on predestina tion, they supposed that God looked for some previous stirrings</page><page sequence="15">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 747 of good on man's own part as a necessary condition for granting him the aids of divine grace and faith which would lead him on towards salvation. On such a theory, though grace was absolutely necessary for justification and salvation, the preparatory striving for the initium fidei, or the beginnings of that process which would cul minate eventually in justification, could be initiated by man's un aided free will. Indeed it was supposed that God had to wait for such a previous initiative on man's part before he could grant the first prompting of grace which would lead on to salvation. This theory was rejected by the Church inasmuch as it made some purely naturai good movement of man's free will the neces sary preliminary before God's salutary grace could come to his aid, and so compromised the revealed truth, attested so eloquently by St Paul, concerning the complete gratuity and primacy of God's merciful intervention to save sinful man. Although the theory of those Gaulish monks safeguarded the absolute necessity of grace for justification and salvation, and so avoided the Pela gian heresy, it was detective inasmuch as it postulated a necessary connection between the first gift of grace and some preceding naturai good works or merits of man. Not inappropriately, then, it was later called semi-Pelagian. When however those monks and others after them asserted that fallen man's free will remains capable in itself of naturally good operations, this was not a semi-Pelagian error, as the Prot estante and Tansenists would allege, but the reaffirmation of an important element of Catholic truth which a too rigid and pes simistic Augustinianism tended to obscure. Although they were in error about the initium fidei, they were not in error in their defence of man's moral responsibility and in their rejection of predestination to Hell. In these doctrines they were in harmony with the perennial belief of the Catholic Church, as witnessed to by the Council of Orange and by several later acts of the Church's magisterium. Election and predestination to fife are purely gratuitous, yet it is equally true that God's saving grace does not necessitate man's free will. Moreover it is not some antecedent and arbitrary rejection by the divine will, but man's own deserts and demerits which give the decisive reason for the eternai condemnation of the lost. « Quod autem quidam salvantur, sahantis est donum; quod autem quidam pereunt, pereuntium est</page><page sequence="16">748 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. meritum. »18 In Dr Oberman's criticisms of Biel's theology, one misses an awareness of the importance which these other truths must have for a balanced and traditional presentation of Catholic truth. He is alert to detect a taint of semi-Pelagianism in Biel's use of the traditional axiom, « Facienti quod in se est Deus non denegai gratiam » ; but he does not acknowledge or appreciate Biel's truly Catholic sense in defending the goodness of human nature and the freedom of man's will even under the primacy of God's saving grace, and in taking seriously the antecedent universality of God's salvific will. The later middle ages were in the main a time of optimism in Western thought. The Franciscan tradition in theology, es pecially in Scotism and in Ockhamist nominalism, stressed the nobility of created nature, and especially of human nature. We can see a secular counterpart of this in the contemporary re surgence of humanist-optimism in the early Renaissance. It was not Pelagianism but a positive Christian sense of the goodness of God's handiwork that inspired this Scotist axiom : « Ponenda est semper naturae nobilitas dutn τφη occurrit rei impossìbilitas » 19. But in reaction to this current of ideas, there was also a strain of exaggerated pessimism in later medieval theology, represented by individuale such as Marsilius of Inghen and in particular Gregory of Rimini, who was to be praised by Luther 20 for his extreme tenets about the corruption of fallen human nature and its powerlessness for any naturai good.21 Biel and the « Gabrie lists », who included Luther's teachers Jodocus Trutfetter and Bartholomew Arnoldi von Usingen, were of course firmly op posed to such heterodox pessimism, which in the following cen turies was again to be expressly rejected by the Catholic Church in her declarations against Baianist and Jansenists errors. 18 Council of Quiersy (A.

He did not allege that such naturally good actions had in themselves any salutary power or merit which could establish a claim in justice, either to eternai life or to the granting of the grace of conversion. What he did hold, and it is •something essentially different, is that God, from pure liber ality and not from any obligation in justice, chooses to bestovv grace on those who by their naturai powers « do what in them lies ». It was in this sense that he spoke of meritum de congruo preceding justification, and that he applied the axiom, « Fadenti quod in, se est Deus non denegai gratxam ». The nominalist theory about the dispositions for justification was controverted by those in the Thomist tradition and has progressively fallen from favour in Catholic theology, but it was not heretical. In deed substantially the same position (with more carefully elabo rated terminology) was defended by many of the Jesuit theol ogians in the great post-Reformation scholastic debates de auxiliis, and is stili defended with untainted orthodoxy by some today. The Molinists later worked out a more refìned terminology to express these ideas. Biel did not have the advantage of their distinction between negative and positive dispositions for receiving grace, nor of the various subtle subdivisions of the term « positive dispositions ».22 Lacking these terminological niceties, his expres sions about the facere quod in se est were, though never heretical, sometimes unsatisfactory by later standards. In safeguarding the doctrine of man's freedom and his naturai capacity for good, even after the Fall, the Scotist and nominalist schoolmen — like the Molinists later — rightly drew attention to the essential distinction between supernatural grace and man's own power to co-operate with grace. But because they tended to con ceive these as two concurrent but separate factors, working to gether to produce the salutary act under the primacy of grace, their theory is judged by many today as somewhat crude and unsatisfactory. The nominalist-Molinist mentality has generally waned, and the trend in modem Catholic theology is to return to 22 Cf. Η. Lance, De Gratta, Freiburg i. Br. 1929, p. 136-164.</page><page sequence="18">750 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. a deeper conception of the polarity between grace and nature, in which, while the essential distinction between the two is retained, they are not thought of as two separate compartments or con current factors, but as intrinsically inter-related in one concrete order of reality, the existential order in which redeemed man, called to a supernatural destiny, actually lives. That Biel and the pre-Reformation nominalists, like many other orthodox theologians before and afterwards, had a less in tegrated and a more artifìcially departmentalized conception of the interaction of grace and free will, did not make them Pe lagians. If it can be said of them, as it can be said of the Molinists a century later, that they tended to stress the con in the divine corycursus, rather than the prae in the divine praemotio, that does not make them heretics. Both aspects belong to the mystery of grace, and both must be safeguarded. In the theology of grace and nature there are two poles of unorthodox extremism, one on either side of the bread centrai field of orthodoxy. One excess is an undue exaltation of the power of man's free will to the neglect of his paramount need for grace; the other is an ultra-pessimism about the corruption of man's nature and a cor responding distortion in the concepì of grace as a necessitating force. Within the pale of orthodoxy there is liberty to incline either towards optimism or pessimism in this matter. And there is no doubt that Biel, while remaining substantially orthodox, inclined firmly towards optimism. It may be said that he veered ultra-pessimism about the corruption of man's nature and a cor dition of human nature after the Fall, on merit de congruo and on man's dispositions for grace; but he was always at pains to safeguard himself from overstepping the bounds of orthodoxy by his insistence that nothing man's naturai powers could do or merit was of any salutary avail in itself. That in fact it could be the prelude to grace was due to God's generosity alone, which was not due by any necessity but sovereignly free23. Moreover, though Biel holds that God normally wills to grant the first grace to those who « do what in them lies », he is careful to observe that God is not bound to await such a good movement of man's will before he can or will grant grace — an observation that once more separates Biel's position from the semi-Pelagian error. So Paul, at the very time he was persecuting Christians 23 I Seni. dist. 17, qu. 1 ; cf. E.S.R., p. 304, note 29.</page><page sequence="19">A NEW APPEAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 751 and was certainly far from the facere quod in se est, was given the sudden gift of saving grace24. God is sovereignly free and generous ; though he always in fact shows mercy to a man who is trying to find him, at times he shows even more sheer mercy to one, like Paul, who is stili opposing to him a rebellious will. Biel would have overstopped the mark and slipped into the semi-Pelagian error if he had held that man's facere quod in se est, and the meritum de congruo attaching to it, produced any kind of necessary exigence for supernatural reward, or any claim in justice to the subsequent bestowal of first grace. But he was explicitly careful to exclude such an opinion : « Meritum de congruo est actus libere elicitus, acceptatus ad aliquid retribuendum, non ex debito iustitiae sed ex sola acceptantis liberalitate. Et hoc meritum non coexigit aequa litatem dignitatis cum retributo, neque in operante, nec in opere, nec in retribuente. Potest enim praemians aliquid retribuere operanti intuitu alicuius actus alias non daturus, non tamen tamquam digno in se, nec ratione operis condigm, sed ex sua liberalitate etiam ei qui inimicus est »25. THE RIDDLE OF PREDESTINATION In the chapter which Dr Oberman devotes to « The Riddle of Predestination » we meet the same preconceptions as in the chapters dealing with justification, and the result is likewise dis appointing. He states his problem of interpretation thus : « Viewed in isolation there seem to be two mutually exclusive doctrines of predestination in Biel's theology. On the one hand there is what appears to be a doctrine of absolute pre destination ante praevisa merita, in the form thus in which Augustine, Thomas Bradwardine, and Gregory of Rimini understood predestination — God's unprecedented and un caused eternai decision with respect to the salvation of his 24 « Paulus a Domino percussus et illuminatus... » : one relevant text is quoted by Oberman, p. 190, note 12. The example of Paul was also to be a favourite one of the Molinists when they too defended themselves from the charge of semi-Pelagianism. They showed, by appealing to such an example, that their doctrine did not mean that man's facere quod in se est was a conditio sine qua non for the gift of grace. 23 II Sent. d. 27, qu. 1, art. l.nota 3; quoted by Oberman, p. 171, note 77.</page><page sequence="20">752 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. creation. On the other hand predestination seems often times to be understood as foreknowledge »26. Rejecting the interpretations of Viganus and other scholars, Dr Oberman solves his problem by deciding that despite some passages that seem to reaffirm an orthodox belief in predestination, Biel (like Ockham) holds what is really a Pelagian doctrine of justifìcation by works and predestination post praevisa merita. The whole discussion of this chapter is patchy and insufficiently based. The author's summaries and criticisms here repeatedly betray an unsure touch as he tries hard to stake out his thesis in the unfamiliar ground. He would have benefìted considerably from a detailed study of the de auxiliis controversy of the post Reformation era, for many of the ideas he discusses, and even the terms he borrows from later Catholic writers, were elaborated and searchingly discussed in that great debate. The problem of harmonizing the doctrine of predestination with belief in God's equity and in men's freedom and moral responsibility has always been and will remain a crux theologorum, and little has been ex plicitly defined by the Church about this mystery. Within the frontiers of orthodoxy much latitude is here allowable, as may be seen by comparing the theories of the Molinists and Congruists on one side with those of the Augustinians and Banezians on the other. Biel, writing at a time when the whole question had not yet been brought into subtle dispute and heated controversy, suc ceeded no better than others in his attempts to throw light on he mystery; yet his position, though inevitably inadequate, was reasonably coherent, not without theological insight and value, and certain'y not heretical. The assumption that clearly lies behind Dr Oberman's argu ment in his chapter on predestination is as follows : If only it can be shown that Biel, however much he may assert in words the absoluteness of the divine predestinatory decree, really holds a doctrine that is equivalent to predestination post praevisa me rita, then he is proved once more to have been an arrant Pelagian. Now the term post praevisa merita is not used by Biel, and Dr Oberman, while introducing it from later theological usage, a1so charges it with his own extreme interpretation when he ap plies it to Biel's teaching. A study of the de auxiliis controversy 26 Oberman, ρ. 187.</page><page sequence="21">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 753 and later Catholic theology would have shown him that post prae visa merita is not necessarily a Pelagian or heretical expression. It would however be more judicious to describe Biel's theory as one of predestination cum praevisis meritis. What is required to safeguard the scriptural doctrine of predestination is to hold that God is the first author and supreme master of the whole economy of salvation; that it is his eternai predilection for each and for ali who are saved that brings them securely and infal libly to their last end. Although, in Catholic teaching, there is no predestination to damnation except post praevisa demerita, that is, the first reason for reprobation is the freely chosen evil of the sinner himself, the converse is not true; what in our in adequate human language we cali predestination to life means that the primacy in salvation, from beginning to end, is in God's love. Some theological theories, such as the Banezian and the Augustinian, suppose that God exercises this primacy in salvation and infallibly achieves his purpose of predestination by means of some intrinsic influence or predetermining force by which he steers the sinner to conversion and the just to final perseverance, while not depriving them of personal free will in the process. Dr Oberman seems to suppose that unless one affirms the exis tence of such an intrinsic force or predetermining grace to bring the sinner to conversion one is a Pelagian. He suggests that because Biel does not postulate any such special intrinsic influence in the yet unjustified sinner (beyond the ordinary divine con cursus necessary to conserve the naturai being and operations of creatures27) he therefore stands convicted of a Pelagian rejection of predestination. But while a Catholic theologian must always safeguard the mysterious truth of the absolute primacy of God's love in bringing the elect to salvation, he is not obliged to postu late the existence of a special intrinsic force as the only means of ensuring that a man reaches his predestined end. The Mo linists of the post-Tridentine era, by appealing to the hypothesis of a divine scientia media concerning man's futurible choices, pro posed an ingenious solution which enabled them to hold that the infallibly efficacious execution of God's predestinating decrees is achieved not ab intrinseco, that is, by some special energy or supernatural influx inserted into man's free will, but ab ex 27 Biel calls this « generale Dei auxiHwm », « adiutorium Dei generale », or even « gratta Dei generalis » and « prima gratta concurrens » ; cf. Ober man, p. 138, note 59, and p. 139, note 61. 4 — « Gregorianum » XLVI (1965) Voi. XLVX.</page><page sequence="22">754 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. trinseco, that is, by the transcendent factor of God's antecedently omniscient and omnipotent control of the whole existential order in which man's responsibility operates. Accordingly thorough going Molinists were able to affirm boldly that predestination was post praevisa merita (i. e. merita futuribilia), and yet to remain staunchly orthodox in holding that the absolute primacy in the salvation of the elect belonged to God's eternai predilection, which had chosen to actuate, out of numberless alternatives, this par ticular existential order in which their merits could be crowned. In Biel's day, of course, the coherent and ingenious theory based on scientia media, as afterwards defended by the Molinists in the de auxiliis controversies, was not yet available. Yet in some significant respects the Ockhamist nominalists foreshadowed the position and outlook of the later Molinist school, whose debt to them is once more discernible here. For Biel, as for Molina, the absolute and infallible control by God of predestination and salvation comes not from any steering force or transient influx inserted into the created system, but from his antecedent and transcendent mastery of the whole existential order of creation. Like ali Catholic theologians, Biel held fìrmly to the need of the ever-present divine causality (auxilium generale) to maintain in being and in act ali created causality; and likewise he affirmed strongly as revealed truth the necessity of man's possessing the intrinsic habitus of sanctifying grace for the attaining of salva tion. But he saw neither of these two factors as a predetermining cause or means for the infallible execution of predestination. MYSTERY OF DIVINE TRANS CENDENCE For Biel and his school no « instants of reason » can be distinguished in God's merciful will, actuating this world order of grace and salvation. Predestination cannot mean that there is in God any succession or alteration, no process of weighing motives or being moved by varying counsels. He saves the sin ner by the transcendent and indivisible decree of his will, which in a mysterious manner blends into the whole economy of salva tion the merits of the elect. « Falsum est quod prius vult finem et post ordinata in finem, quia non est nisi unus actus divinae</page><page sequence="23">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 755 voluntatis »128 and there is the truth of faith : « Nihil in re extra Deum ponitur causa praedestinationis » ; on the other, the equally certain truth that in this order God achieves the salvation of the elect in such wise that it is the crowning of their merits, which depends on their free will : « Nulli adulto confertur vita aeterna nisi propter aliquid eius meritum. Omne autem meritum est in potestate merentis » 2e. Dr Oberman thinks that the Ockhamists' rejection of the Scotist « instante of reason », or successive order of deliberations and decisions in the divine counsel, removed an « insuperable wall of defense against the inroads of Pelagianism ». He asserts : « This rejection of an intrinsic order of decisions in God is the philosophical complement of the theological thesis of a predestina tion post praevisa merita »30. The assertion shows once more a simpliste understanding of the position of Biel and his school, whom Dr Oberman is resolved to convict of practically equating predestination with foreknowledge, and of thus making God sub ject to his creature's decision. But Biel and the other moderni were far from dissolving away the doctrine of predestination by reducing it to mere divine acquiescence in foreseen human free choices, and such a crass error is by no means the necessary result of rejecting the Scotist « instante of reason » in the divine counsel. Rather, it can be argued with more justice that the nominalists, by rejecting the anthropomorphism limpide in those « instants of reason », remitted the mystery of predestination and human moral responsibility to the sphere in which it properly belongs — to that of the divine transcendence. No temporal or logicai commensuration is possible between the ineffable and ab solute decree of God, actuating this world order from his eternai « Now », and the working out of that decree in the time and suc cession of created existence81. Dr Oberman refers to the nominalists' conception of « the ' dome », the sphere established by the potentia ordinata, excluding ali God's nonrealized possibilities »30 ; and he supposes that for 28 II Sent. d. 20, qu. 1, art. 1, nota 3; quoted by Oberman, p. 213, note 74. 29 Cf.

I. the nominalists the importance of this « dome » is to exalt the dignity and autonomy of human creatures, thus set free in a kind of Pelagian independence from the mastery of divine grace. But in fact it is in this « dome » of divine transcendence, in the creative fiat by which God actuates this particular world-order with ali it contains, in preference to ali the other « nonrealized possibilities », that Biel (like Molina after him) finds the secret of God's antecedent and infallible control of salvation and ali human destiny. The time may yet come when it will be generally acknowledged that, despite ali their shortcomings, the nominalist Molinist speculations on grace, free-will and predestination in the 14Λ to 17th centuries played a valuable part in keeping open this horizon of mystery, which a too-confìdent theology of physical predetermination would have closed. Thus although Biel's doctrine of predestination is laconic and jiot worked out in a full-length systematic treatise, one can see that Dr Oberman's analysis fails to do it justice, and that it is not the superficial aberration that he supposes. Biel does gen uinely hold an « absolute » doctrine of predestination, as Catholic faith requires; and at the same time he holds, without incon sistency, that God includes man's merits as factors concatenated into his scheme of predestination. It is because Dr Oberman attaches such importance to what he alleges to be Biel's « essentially Pelagian » doctrine of the pro cess of justification and salvation that I have considered it neces sary to dwell on this charge at some length. His book will un doubtedly influence future studies of date-medieval theology, and much of its influence will be useful and corrective. But on this question of pre-Reformation « Pelagianism », its influence will, unfortunately, be misleading. Moreover, building on his present conclusions, Dr Oberman promises us a subsequent study « to investigate the relation of nominalist theology to the beginnings of Reformation theology » 33. It is to be feared that this investiga tion too will be handicapped by the exaggerated extension which the author gives to the terms « Pelagian » and « semi-Pelagian », and which leads him to present Gabriel Biel, and with him many other Catholic theologians, as Pelagians. True, Biel's nominalism was only one among several currents in late-medieval theology, but it is one which is especially relevant to the discussion of the 33 Ibid., ρ. 328.</page><page sequence="25">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 757 background of Martin Luther's opinions, since it was the school the Reformer knew best. SUSPICIONS ABOUT MARIOLOGY My second main criticism concerns the section of the book in which Dr Oberman treats of Biel's Mariology. Here, despite his conscientious efforts to comprehend, the author signally fails. Perhaps this is because the subject has become such an emotive one in more recent times, especially with the vigorous develop ment of Catholic Mariological speculation since the middle of the 19* century. At any rate one feels that Dr Oberman is finding it difficult to maintain his dispassionate impartiality as he dis cusses it. One has the impression that the Problematik of the present day is being read back into the fifteenth century. It is signifìcant that the author makes repeated references to modem Mariological writings and later developments in Catholic belief and devotion. Since he assumes that later Roman Catholic Mari ology marks a serious aberration from sound Christian theology, he is intent on detecting evidence for the same aberration already present and operative in pre-Reformation theology. The corollary will follow that when Reformation theology separated from Roman Catholic theology this aberration was, at least implicitly, one of the vital matters at issue. It seems important in an historical study to keep these ques tions distinct. It is one question to ask whether the modem Catholic Mariology of the last hundred years or so is an aberrant development; it is another to ask whether Catholic Mariology was an important issue in the theological struggle of the 16th century and one of the causes of the Reformation; it is stili another to ask what the nominalist theologians of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and Gabriel Biel in particular, taught about the place of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Gpd's pian for the world. It is professedly this last question alone that falls within Dr Ober man's scope; but he has not been able to deal with it simply and squarely because he is ali the time preoccupied with the other questions belonging to later ages. He has approached Biel's Mariology with an attitude ' which I can only describe as one of suspecting the worst, and the result is that on many points he has</page><page sequence="26">758 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. simply misunderstood him, and misunderstood the matters under discussion. An example of this can be seen in the following allegation : « The high elevation of Mary as corredemptrix [the terra is in troduced by Dr Oberman, not taken from Biel] and even more as mediatrix introduces unadulterated docetic elements into Biel's conception of Christ »34. Again, we are told that there is « Pelagian Mariology » in Biel's sermons, on evidence which does not sub tsantiate the charge, and with a use of the term « Pelagian » which is farther than ever from the proper historical and theolog ical meaning of the name. Another example can be seen in the way one or two phrases jn Biel's sermons about the dignity of the Blessed Virgin are singled out and vested with a sinister significance. The impres sion is given that Biel (with Catholic medieval piety in general) is so eager to exalt Mary above ordinary mortals that he teaches some kind of quasi-divine pre-existence of the Mother of God from the beginning of the world, or even from eternity. We are told that in his sermons Biel, departing from the more cautious reticence of his academic works, « adds the further clarification that Mary's soul is created with sanctifying grace, not merely in the womb of Mother Ann but at the beginning of creation » (p. 296). In English, at any rate, these words seem obviously to suggest the notion of a supra-historical existence of Marys' soul from the beginning of the world 35. But the Latin text from Biel's sermons appended to substantiate this statement reads as follows : « Fuit quoque anima eius nedum in utero sed in creationis 34 Ibid., ρ. 319. In the same place we read : « There could hardly be a clearer instance of docetism than the statement : Christ is not fully man, but God-man ». Unfortunately the words of Biel here mistranslated as « fully man » are « purus homo » - « mere man ». 35 Similarly on p. 297 we are told: «Gregory [of Rimini] opts for an extinction of the fomes peccati [in Mary] at the moment of the first sanctification ; while Biel — though indecisive in the Collectoriwm — in his Marian sermons states that this sanctification took place at an even earlier time, at the moment of creation. » Confusion becomes wor.se con founded when we compare this with a sentence on page 296 : « The question whether the fomes peccati is totally extinguished or rather neutralized by an abundance of grace, and a second question whether this cleaning took place at the moment of animation before the birth of Mary — that is, the first sanctification, or passive conception — or at the moment of conception by the Holy Spirit — that is, the second sanctification or active conception, Biel does not want to answer in the Collectoriwm ». What an unprofìtable expenditure of paper and ink would be needed to clear up ali the misapprehensions suggested by those few lines !</page><page sequence="27">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 759 principio sanctificata per gratiam sibi concreatam ». From Biel's whole Mariological teaching and from the ordinary setting of the question in the medieval schools, there is no doubt what he means. He holds that Mary's soul was sanctified not merely (as many medieval doctors held) by grace bestowed upon her in her mother's womb at a moment subsequent to the first instant of her existence — that is to say, the instant when her soul was created and began to animate the matter of her body — but rather that it was sanctified in that very first instant of its exis tence, by grace « concreated » with it. Biel does not imagine that Mary's soul had pre-existed since the creation of the world, but his point is that sanctifying grace was hers not only at a sub sequent stage when she was already living in the womb, but by an endowment provided for her by God in creating her soul when her life began. In other words, he zealously defended· the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, and it is simply this that he is expressing in the sentence which Dr Oberman suspects. « In, creationis principio » here does not mean « from the beginning of the world », but « from the beginning of her creation ». Similar suspicione about a belief in Mary's pre-existence can be traced in other places. We get a hint of them on p. 294, where we are told that for Biel, « according to the argument of eternai predestination, she had always been the Mother of God ». In the text thus summarized Biel is explaining how Christ, as God, chose to preserve his Mother from any taint of sin antecedently to her conception, by an eternai decree. He does not say, how ever, « she had always been the Mother of God » ; but he says « from eternity she had been chosen to be Mother of God »36. MARY «ALMOST CONCREATRIX » ? At length Dr Oberman's suspicions come out into the open when he goes on to disclose how he understands Biel's doctrine of the « eternai predestination » of Mary. « In Biel's presenta tion », we are told, « it plays an important part in fusing her temporal and eternai relation to God » (p. 297-48). The tendency 36 « Nec impedit quod concepta nondum mater fuit quia quod nondum fuit in hibitione [?] semper fuit in aeterna praedestinationej nec enim temporaliter sed ab aeterno in matrem Dei electa est». Collectoriwm, lib. III, dist. 3, qu. 1, art. 2G.</page><page sequence="28">760 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. is to make Mary « almost Concreatrix » (p. 308). Since the proof of this assertion is taken from a passage in which Biel rejects the notion that Mary could be concreatrix, Dr Oberman's argument here is hard to follow. It is above ali the use of the Wisdom texts in Marian piety, in the tradition of St Bernard and the medieval Latin liturgy, that Dr Oberman produces as his trump card. Biel is here ex posed as guilty of the gross errors which later Protestant polemic would bring against Roman « Mariolatry ». The « influence of extensive sophia speculations » on Biel's Mariology is judged to be sinister. « The idea of the eternai wisdom », the author affirms, « seems to lift the Virgin Mary out of history and to make her so nearly coeternai with the Father that she, though not fully concreatrix and thus stili subordinate to the Father, becomes his assistant at creation » (p. 317-318). In support of this grave assertion a short excerpt from a sermon of Biel's is cited, in which occur the words : « Quia ad finem creationis cooperata est recte creatori astitisse dicitur ». Dr Oberman comments that from language such as this, suggesting that the prerogatives of the Holv Spirit, including « assistance at the creation », are attributed to Mary, « it is tempting to conclude that Biel presents here a new trinitarian doctrine : God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit have been changed into Father, Son and Mother » (p. 319). However, he goes on to note that in other places Biel avoids this gross heresy and uses the language of traditional ortho doxy. The unwary reader may well gather, nevertheless, that Biel was really capable of any theological enormity, since even in the paragraph in which Dr Oberman allows him some extenua tion, he explains : « The fact that Mary assumes some divine pre rogatives is clearly the result of Biel's dose identification [sic] of Mary with the second Person of the Trinity». Let us examine the incriminated passage from Biel's sermon on which such serious charges are based. Notwithstanding his clear and traditional orthodoxy in innumerable other places in his works about the Trinity, about the divine nature, about the in finite distance between Creator and creature, does he in this place contradict ali Catholic theology up to his day, and his own theology as a whole, by fading into the heresy of calling Mary « nearly coeternai with the Father » and « almost Concreatrix », and of making her « assume some divine prerogatives » ?</page><page sequence="29">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 761 A straightforward examination of the passage in its context shows that he does not. Biel is taking care to explain in a wholly orthodox sense the bold accommodation of certain Wisdom texts from the Old Testament to Mary, a poetic usage adopted in the llturgy and going back to St Bernard. It was clear that such texts as Proverbs 8,22 seq., required an explanatory gloss when applied to the Blessed Virgin : « Dominus possedit me in initio viarum suarum, antequam quidquam faceret a principio. Ab ae terno ordinata sum et ex antiquis antequam terra fieret... Quando praeparabat caelos, aderam ... Cum eo eram cuncta componens »S7. Biel proceeds, with typical medieval concordism, to provide a prudent and ingenious gloss in order to remove any suspicion of unorthodox meaning from the Marian accommodation of this passage. Mary could not of course have been a co-operator in the originai work of creation, he says, since she did not exist then : « Non ita quod ipsa fuerit concreatrix cum fuerant dispo sata a creaturae principio; non enim tunc erat in rerum natura». But because ali creation was made for the divine purpose, and this purpose finds its consummation in Christ, and because Mary by her fiat and her motherhood co-operated in the Incarnation of Christ, which is the « finis creationis », then she can in a true sense be said to have « assisted the Creator ». This is the harm less meaning of the phrase of Biel which Dr Oberman thinks so fraught with sinister implications : « Quia ad finem creationis cooperata est, recte creatori astitisse dicitur». Biel was in no way the initiator of the usage of accommo dating the Wisdom texts to Mary, and his references to this usage only serve to show his orthodox understanding of the place of Mary in God's pian. It is plain from his whole theology how completely alien it would be to his mind to attribute to a pure creature, Mary, any divine prerogatives ; or to confuse the worth of a creature, however much he extolled her privileges of grace and goodness, with the infinite, eternai and transcendent nature of God. That Dr Oberman repeatedly tries to find traces of such a confusion in Biel's words, and in each case signally misun 37 Similar borrowings were made from chapter 24 of Ecclesiasticus, where it is said of Wisdom : « Ego ex ore Altissimi prodivi primogenita ante omnem creaturam... Ab initio et ante saecula creata sum, et usque ad futurum saeculum non desinam, et in habitatione sancta coram ipso ministravi» (w. 5, 14).</page><page sequence="30">762 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. derstands them, seems to betray a latent « apperceptive » factor which conditions his approach to Catholic Mariology. It is with real regret that I have felt obliged to dwell so critically on certain sections of Dr Oberman's book, since, as I hope I have made clear, there is so much else to profit from and to praise in other sections. Since at so many points he has vindicated Biel from the unfair interpretations of earlier critics, it may web be that he may yet acknowledge that he himself has not done Biel justice in the matters Ί have indicated. He praises Otto Scheel's presentation of Biel's teaching on predestination as « the most reliable interpretation to date »38, but has failed to appreciate that Scheel's adverse judgement was coloured by the same kind of prejudices and misunderstandings that elsewhere he himself justly exposes in the case of other writers. Apart from the main criticisms already mentioned, I should add that I noted many further points of detail or of interpreta tion of texts which seemed to cali for correction or revision. For instance, in note 103 on page 223 the author has both omitted a line from the Tridentine decree and failed to identify who were the iactantes it was aimed at — that is, the Lutherans ! And why does that guid Scot, John Major of Haddington, appear on page 20 disguised as Johann Maior? Again, while Dr Oberman fairly recognizes that the caricature presented by B. J. Kidd of Biel's doctrine of the Mass « does not seem to portray the balance of Biel's position » (p. 279, note 116), he uncritically follows another author in attributing an unsound signifìcance to a phrase in which Biel says that the Mass has « similar » effects to the sacrifice of Calvary, instead of «the same» (ibid., note 117). I have shown elsewhere the orthodox sense in which Biel uses that phrase, and how he does in fact also say in a parallel pas sage, quite consistently, that the sacrifice of the Mass brings « the same » effects as the redemptive sacrifice of the cross.39 THEOLOGICAL LIBERTY VINDICATED However, it would be an uncongenial pursuit to multiply particular points of criticism. With ali due reservations made 38 Oberman, ρ. 196, note 21. 39 E.S.R., ρ. 313-318.</page><page sequence="31">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 763 on the key questions of grace and Mariology, one must stili acknowledge the very considerable merits of Dr Oberman's re search. On the general religious character of nominalism and on its place and influence in Catholic theology, it is naturally gratifying to mark a substantial agreement at many points be tween Dr Oberman's findings and my own study of that theo logical movement. Perhaps I may indicate this general area of agreement by quoting the words in which I summed up my own conclusions : « To suppose that the nominalists and moderni were scep tics and revolutionaries, engaged on undermining Catholic doctrine with a subversive positivism, is to form a quite false picture of the period preceding the Reformation... The picture of late-medieval theology as rotten with an all pervasive and ali-corrosive nominalism does not survive con frontation with the facts. Generalizations and sweeping censures are no substitute for examination of the writings and records of the age in question.... It is justifìcable to see in the system of the nominalists a decline from the heights of thirteenth-century scholasticism, and to conclude that some of their speculations provided a Springboard for certain Reformation doctrines ; but it is not possible to mamtain that they had captured and corrupted ali Catholic theology. Theirs was only one among rivai schools, and an examination of what they actually wrote and taught discredits the assumption that they must have fatally dis fìgured whatever dogmatic truth they touched. Pre-Reforma tion nominalism must be judged as it actually was, in the form which Luther knew, as in the teaching of such men as Biel, Trutfetter and von Usingen. The Reformers un doubtedly found more in Ockhamism that was apt for their purpose than in Thomism, but their title to originality is none the less intact; the change from the theology of Gabriel Biel to that of Martin Luther was not an evolution but a revolution. » 40 Limits of space preclude further comment here on Dr Ober man's interesting and though-provoking chapter on Biel's doctrine of Tradition, which he rightly sees as important for a fuller un derstanding of the Tridentine debates and decrees on that ques tion, and of later Catholic theological development. Chapter 10, « E.S.R., ρ. 307. 321-322.</page><page sequence="32">764 FRANCIS CLARK, S. I. on « Nominalistic Mysticism » must have special mention, for it contains much valuable matter. Here the author exposes as un tenable the hitherto common assumption that nominalism and mys ticism were incompatible, and that they represented two inde pendent and antagonistic currents in late medieval thought. Here too be corrects another often-repeated assertion, namely that the « acceptation » doctrine of the nominali sts was the forerunner of the Reformation doctrine of forensic justification. These pages (353-356) are particularly noteworthy, and the conclusion firmly emerges that the Scotists' and nominalists' doctrine of accepta tion « is not the exterior declaration or favor Dei of later Prot estant orthodoxy », and « can in no sense of the word be charac terized as forensic ». Much stili remains to be said about the theology of those who were called moderni in the age which preceded the Refor mation. The significance of their speculations was deeper than is often supposed; they were not mere word-spinners, but were concerned with the ultimate questions. The continuity of their ideas and arguments at the time of Trent and afterwards, espe cially in the vigorous new Jesuit schools of the post-Reformation era, has not yet been sufficiently studied. Dr Oberman has col lected a number of testimonies to show the high esteem in which Biel continued to be held in the century following his death. Among other evidence of this continuing influence one may note that the very first course of public lectures given by a theologian of the new Society of Jesus was on a text of Gabriel Biel. They were lectures given by James Lainez at the Sapienza in Rome, on Biel's Expositio Canonis Missae, the book which the young Martin Luther had read, as he related later, « with a bleeding heart », when he was preparing with great fervour for his priestly ordination and first celebration of Mass. 41 It may be that we shall yet see a return to favour of Biel and his fellow moderni, as they are progressively vindicated from misrepresentation, and as the deeper implications of some of their distinctive ideas are more fully recognized and seen to accord with some trends in present-day theological thought. For my part, though I find uncongenial the metaphysics and general theo logical speculations of the nominalists, I would stoutly defend 41 Luther, Tischreden, Weimar 1914, voi. HI, p. 192, no. 3146: cf. E.S.R., p. 82. 113.</page><page sequence="33">A NEW APPRAISAL OF LATE-MEDIEVAL THEOLOGY 765 their liberty, in the doctrinal context of their day, to propose and explore those ideas. It would be a sad day for the vitality and progress of theological science if minority schools, whether of Scotists, or Ockhamists, or Suarezians, or Augustinians, or Molinists, or others, were denied the right to express their par ticular insights and theories, or if they were refused a fair hear ing by being unfairly prejudged as unorthodox. Within the bounds of a common orthodoxy, these schools providentially serve as « opposition parties », as it were, in the debating chamber of Catholic theology; firmly loyal to the doctrines of the Church, they yet critically test and temper those views and theses which, though they may be held by the greater number of theologians, stili belong to the sphere of free debate. Even if their own theses on disputed questions are often judged to be less probable and are later abandoned as obsolete, they may serve at least to bring out some aspects of the truth which might otherwise be neglected, and to prevent Catholic theology from being mono polized by what may be merely the majority party of the day. A plurality of theological currents in the Church safeguards the freedom and flexibility of future theological development. As an eminent representative of one such minority party which served a providential purpose in the history of Ctaholic theology, Gabriel Biel is not merely an irrelevant figure from the past. Dr Ober man's study is a timely reminder of the relevance of Biel, and of others like him, in every age. In conclusion, mention must also be made here of another important publication concerning Biel, in which Dr Oberman has again taken a prominent part. Together with William J. Cour tenay, he has undertaken the very useful task of making available a new edition of Biel's Exposition of the Canon of the Mass.42 It includes a concise and informative introduction, criticai appa ratus, and footnotes giving Biel's source references. The edition will eventually be complete in four volumes, and will fili a long felt need. Francis Clark, S.
