<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Classical and Mythographic Sources of Pope's Dulness By THOMAS C. FAULKNER and RHONDA L. BLAIR THE GREAT MOTHER, or Magna Mater, is mentioned by Pope in the text and notes to the Dunciad no less than five times, yet no one has thus far explored the classical and mythographic sources of the goddess and her cult, an exploration which reveals a deeper relationship between the Magna Mater and Dulness than is at first apparent.1 Indeed, the bulk of past critical and scholarly work on the Dunciad has focused on the allusions to contemporary events and persons and the political and cultural climate. Even given Pope's erudition and extensive classical studies, these sources have been largely overlooked by critics (exceptions are acknowledged below). Without question, Pope's use of classical material and ancient wisdom hints at an overall deeper meaning of the Dunciad, for the Dunces themselves, generally ignorant of classical studies, will only be able to grasp the apparent satire. Their understanding of the Dunciad is destined from the beginning to be and to remain superficial. Pope's interweaving of various myths, allegories, historical accounts, and antiquarian findings related to the Magna Mater builds up both the complex figure of Dulness and the awful context of her empire. The synthesis is the final redaction of his imaginative blending of years of reading and study of the classics and his deep-rooted artistic beliefs and cultural values. And of course Pope's adaptation of such a wealth of myth is consistent with his adaptations of classical Greek, Roman, and Miltonic material; that he drew on a large and often confused body of information to shape Dulness is not at all incompatible with the richness of his allusions to the Aeneid, Apollo and Orpheus, or Paradise Lost. Aubrey Williams has very briefly touched upon the similarities between the Magna Mater and her cult and Dulness and the Dunces, but he stresses them within the overall context of the Aeneid, hence his emphasis on Venus, the mother of Aeneas.2 What Williams has not penetrated are the deeper relationships between the mythographic presentations of the Magna Mater and the history of her cult, both coming from sources I The Twickenham Edition of the Poems of Alexander Pope, gen. ed.

Furthermore, he implies that Pope makes significant use of the Magna Mater cult only in Book IV.3 What has not hitherto been noticed is that the composite figure of the Magna Mater, built up from many goddesses, not only forms the basis of Dulness and her "cult" but is alluded to throughout the four books of the Dunciad, and that this composite Dulness is extensively based on Renaissance and especially eighteenth-century mythographic works as well as classical sources. Pope's relation to and interest in Renaissance classicism has been dis- cussed by R. G. Petersen.4 He relates Pope's use of owls, laurel, ivy, and the presence of Apollo and the gaping serpent found in the opening motto from Ovid to the still-influential Renaissance humanism and its ideal conception and interpretation of the classical world. According to Petersen, Pope approached the classics "almost as a Renaissance man" and his use of the classical past fits "the tradition of Renaissance classi- cism rather than . . . the more modern scientific, archaeologizing, demythologizing study of Greece and Rome" characteristic of eighteenth- century scholarship.5 Such Renaissance mythographic works as Cesare Ripa's Iconologia (1593), which had been translated by Pierce Tempest in 1709, and those of Boccaccio, Gyraldus, and Cartari, are cited as examples of characteristic Renaissance allegorizing of mythology. Pope was certainly familiar with these sources and others, and their influence is evident in the Dunciad; to infer, however, as Petersen does, that he used these works with the same allegorizing intent as their authors is another matter. These Renaissance works, like the classical ones, often provided him with ideas, imagery, and contexts for inversion, but the influence of the eighteenth-century "demythologizing" writers is far stronger and provides a philosophical context for Pope's Dulness. It should not be forgotten that Pope's close friend Joseph Spence was working on Polymetis (1747), his "demythologized" account of the relationship between the works of the Roman poets and the remains of Roman art, and that he almost certainly discussed this work with Pope as early as the summer of 1739.6 In his Preface Spence discusses the faults of earlier writers who have attempted too vast a work, whereas he has limited himself to statuary in Italy.7 The authors of these "single and voluminous collections," which Spence disparages, include Graevius, 3Williams, p. 28. 4"Renaissance Classicism in Pope's Dunciad," Studies in English Literature, 15 (1975):431-445. 5Petersen, p. 432. 6Spence relates in his Observations, Anecdotes, and Characters of Books and Men Collected from Conver- sation, ed. James M. Osborn, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1966), p. 173 (No. 394), an incident in which he asked Pope's advice on the placing of prepositions at the end of a sentence. Osborn points out in his anno- tation to this anecdote that an earlier manuscript makes it clear that Spence was concerned with the writing of dialogues and that his Polymetis is referred to. 215</page><page sequence="4">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Gronovius, and Montfaucon, all authors with whom Pope was familiar.8 Another eighteenth-century commentator and compiler working in the same vein as the above writers is the Abbe Banier, whose "Fables of Ovid Explained" is cited in one of Warburton's notes to the Dunciad (1:37), and Pope wrote to Warburton saying that he was very pleased with this note on Proteus.9 Finally, Pope's admiration for Warburton's Divine Legation of Moses (1738-1741), containing a discussion of Oriental and Greek mysteries, is seen in his letters, where he writes to Warburton that he "travel[s] thro your book, as thro an Amazing Scene of ancient Egypt or Greece, struck with Veneration &amp; Wonder" and later expresses his pleasure upon reading Warburton 's "Dissertations on Hieroglyphicks. " 10 Pope was, then, certainly familiar with the tradition of Renaissance classicism, but he does not, as Petersen holds, follow its allegorizing tendencies, a tradition which is in fact opposed to that of the classical writers themselves, Pope's lifelong models." More specifically, Pope works in the modern eighteenth-century "scientific" tradition of classical scholarship, which does not exclude the "old wisdom." What Pope so firmly opposes is the abuse of scholarship. Like the perversions of and in the arts and sciences, the "new scholarship" Pope satirically exposes is the shoddy and superficial "scholarship" of the Dunces, totally lacking in wisdom. As Aubrey Williams points out, the Magna Mater has been histor- ically, and of course mythographically, confused, an important fact not only in understanding her relationship with the many goddesses and myths with which she has been connected, but also in reinforcing the idea of chaos which she embodies in the Dunciad. 12 This past historical confusion further strengthens the reality of the chaos of Pope's historical present. Although his picture is framed within an imaginative inter- 7Joseph Spence, Polymetis; or, An Enquiry concerning the Agreement between the Works of the Roman Poets, and the Remains of the Antient Artists.

(Leyden, 1694-99), and Johann Friedrich Gronovius, author of Thesaurus Graecarum Antiquitatum, 12 vols. (Leyden, 1697-1702), are mentioned by Pope in "An Essay on Homer," which precedes the text of his Iliad. Bernard de Montfaucon is mentioned in a letter from Pope to Caryll, dated Nov. 19 [17141, with reference to Montfaucon's book Le Comte de Gabalis (1670), in George Sherburn's edition of The Correspondence of Alexander Pope, 5 vols. (Oxford, 1956), 1:268 (hereafter cited as Pope's Correspondence). Since Pope was aware of Spence's work on Polymetis, which was extensively researched during the latter's three Grand Tours of 1713, 1737, and 1739, and since Spence was obviously well acquainted with Montfaucon's monumental L'Antiquite expliquee, et represent6e en figures, 5 vols. in 10 (Paris, 1719), which was translated by David Humphreys as Antiquity Explained and Represented in Sculptures, 5 vols. (London, 1721-22; rpt. New York, 1976), it is very unlikely that Pope was ignorant of this work. References to Montfaucon given in subsequent notes are to this translation. 216</page><page sequence="5">SOURCES OF POPE'S DULNESS twining of classical allusions, many of these are rooted in classical history. It should not be forgotten that the "demythologizing" study of antiquity included historical writing. Among prominent eighteenth-century classical historians was Pope's friend Nathaniel Hooke, who published Vol. I of his Roman History in 1738.'3 The importance of Pope's selection of the Magna Mater in relation to his own times and those of Augustus will be examined in the concluding section of this essay. The names Magna Mater (Mater Defum, Magna Mater Deorum) and Cybele have always been confused and used interchangeably from ancient times, and the Magna Mater has been identified with Berecyn- thia, Phrygia, Rhea, Ops, Tellus, Bona Dea, Dea Syria, the Idaea Mother, the Pessinuntian goddess, Dindymene, Isis, the elder Vesta, Ceres, Bellona, Diana of Ephesus, Flora, and Pales, and sometimes with Juno, Minerva, and Venus. This confusion began in antiquity, largely due to the absorption of one foreign deity into the figure and cult of another preexisting one, and was subsequently strengthened by myth- ographers. Alexander Ross, for example, describes Cybele and her cult in his Mystagogus Poeticus, or, The Muses Interpreter (1653) but calls her Rhea.'4 Such confusion offers countless possibilities for artistic development and expansion, and Pope not only took advantage of this situation but super- imposed other goddesses as well through associations of attributes or similarities of cults and myths; thus much of the richness of the Dunciad results not merely from simple allusions but from entire series of allusions, sometimes forming a very complex web of cross-associations- somewhat in the manner of a chain reaction. The basic prototype of ' Fables of Ovid Explained" refers to Ovidd's Metamorphoses . . . with Historical Explications of the Fables . . . by the Abbot Banier (Amsterdam, 1732), which gives the Latin text facing the English trans- lation by Dryden, Addison, Garth, and others. There is also a brief discussion of Proteus which is similar to that in the note cited by Warburton in Banier's La Mythologie et les fables expliqudes par I'histoire, 3 vols. (Paris, 1738-40), which was translated anonymously as Mythology and Fables of the Ancients, Explain 'dfrom History, 4 vols. (London, 1739-40; rpt. New York, 1976). Pope's knowledge of this latter work may be assumed from his familiarity with Banier's "Fables of Ovid Explained." Sutherland has acknowledged the importance of Mythology and Fables of the Ancients in his note to 1:37. References to Banier given in subsequent notes are to the translation of this latter work. Sutherland quotes an undated letter from Pope to Warburton in his note to 1:37; Sherburn dates the letter (British Library MS. Egerton 1946) as [Nov. 6, 1742] in Pope's Correspondence, 4:425.

III and IV after Hooke's death, in 1764 and 1771, respectively.

Moreover, the female personages which figure in the Dunciad have their counterparts within the complex figure of Dulness. Cybele is primarily associated with eunuch priests, frenetic dancing, wailing, and the noise of clashing cymbals and the tympanum. She is usually represented iconographically as a robust woman sitting in her lion-drawn chariot or on a throne, wearing a turreted crown to show that she is the protectress of cities, with a tympanum in one hand and either a pine-tree branch or a scepter in the other, but sometimes a large key or pitcherlike vase is present. To this basic representation other attributes are added or subtracted; Montfaucon, for example, pictures sculptures in which she is wearing a laurel crown as well as the turreted one and carries a caduceus, symbol of Mercury, and others where she is riding on a lion or standing upright without any other attributes but the turreted crown and a pitcher.15 The main source for the accounts of the origin of her cult with which Pope was undoubtedly familiar, those by William King, Bernard de Montfaucon, and the Abbe Banier, is Diodorus Siculus.16 In these accounts Cybele, the daughter of a Phrygian king, is left to die on top of Mt. Cybele (hence her name). However, she is nursed by wild animals and subsequently rescued by local shepherds. She grows up, wise and beautiful, and falls in love with a shepherd, Attys, who is killed by her father after the reunion of the king with his daughter. At this, Cybele runs madly through the countryside, shrieking and beating a tympanum. While she is absent, the Phrygians are struck by a plague, and their oracle requires them, in order to expiate their offense, to disinter Attys and worship Cybele with annual games and festivals in her honor. Another story, recounted by Ovid, King, and Banier, describes how Cybele, now an aged goddess, has a priest named Attys who castrates himself behind a pine tree after having broken the vow of chastity made to her. When he dies from his self-inflicted wounds, she changes him into such a tree. Subsequently, the pine tree becomes sacred to Cybele."7 15Montfaucon, Pi. 4, Fig. 4; P1. 1, Fig. 13; P1. 1, Fig. 3, respectively.

He ignores her, even though she is a goddess, and agrees to marry the daughter of Midas, king of Pessinus. On learning of this engagement, the enraged and slighted Cybele breaks open the city gates with her army, makes a general havoc of the city, and finally castrates Attys when she finds him hiding behind a pine tree.18 Pope uses the Cybele and Attys myths in the Dunciad, and his allusions to Cybele and Attys provide good examples of his subtle blending of mythology with the overt, contemporary subject matter of the poem. In this blending he intentionally confuses the mythological material to suit his satiric purpose. The aged Cybele in love with the young Attys is trans- formed into the aged Dulness in love with the "lively," if not youthful, Cibber: Dulness with transport eyes the lively Dunce, Remembring she herself was Pertness once. (1:111-112) But an even more subtle allusion to the Attys myth is found in Book IV, where Pope satirizes the young Dunces and their Grand Tours of Europe (11. 293-326). Here Pope first ironically compares the typical young rake, who intrepidly travels over land and sea, to Aeneas, and then alludes to Catullus' version of the Attys myth. Catullus begins his poem about Attys by describing the swift sea journey which carries Attys from Rome to Phrygia. On entering the dark and shadowy forest of the goddess Cybele, he is struck with madness and castrates himself.19 Pope alludes to this version in the following lines, ostensibly about the Grand Tour: Where, eas'd of Fleets, the Adriatic main Wafts the smooth Eunuch and enamour'd swain. (4:309-310) Pope has here fused the shepherd Attys with the newly made eunuch of Catullus' poem. By reversing the order (Attys was a shepherd before becoming a eunuch) and by joining the eunuch and swain by a coordi- nating conjunction, Pope introduces a great amount of subtlety and ambi- guity: the two may be separate persons or the same one. For the reader who is aware of the ways in which Pope blends mythology with the surface events and people of the Dunciad, these allusions to Attys and Cybele add new dimensions-sterility and madness, cruelty and darkness-to Cibber and Dulness. I8Banier, 2:560-561, citing Arnobius. Montfaucon mentions a very similar story but provides no discussion. l9Catullus 63. 1-6. 221</page><page sequence="10">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Pope's manner of employing the Attys myth is similar to the ways in which he emphasizes the close relationship between the Magna Mater and his own Dulness. The Magna Mater or Cybele, the Mother of the Gods and of all nature itself, is explicitly identified as Pope's main personage in the opening line of the Dunciad, "The Mighty Mother" (1:1), and in the Dunces' appeal to Dulness, "Great Queen, and common Mother of us all!" (4:404). And although the Magna Mater is an earth goddess, her origin was in the sky: she fell to earth in the form of a black meteoric stone near Pessinus (in Asia Minor) around the sixth century B.C.20 This stone or "statue" was later moved to a large temple built in her honor at Pergamum, and a replica of this shapeless, or, in some accounts, blocklike, stone was paraded by her priests in religious processions throughout the region. With the spread of her cult, these pro- cessions took place in Phrygia, Syria, Greece, and finally in Rome itself. Indeed, her name, Cybele in Greek and Cybebe in Latin, is thought to derive from cubus (cube); other possible etymologies include Semitic and Greek roots referring to mountains and caves."i She is thus a fitting proto- type of Dulness, mother of blockheads and inhabitants of caves and grottoes. It is highly probable that Pope's reference to "Jove's block" at the end of Book I alludes to this stone image of the Magna Mater, who in the form of Dulness will devour the world, just as the stork did the frogs in Aesop's fable, to which Pope's lines directly refer: So when Jove's block descended from on high (As sings thy great forefather Ogilby) Loud thunder to its bottom shook the bog, And the hoarse nation croak'd, "God save King Log!" (1:327-330) In the following four sections of the essay, the relationship between other goddesses identified with the Magna Mater and Dulness is examined. The discussion is organized around the passages or images in the Dunciad which allude to one or more of these goddesses; hence the mention of a given goddess in several places. This procedure clearly reveals how Pope expands the meaning of a passage through a wide spec- trum of classical references, as of course occurs in the passage just dis- cussed, where the image of a devouring monarch is suggested by the use of the particular fable. 2(Grant Showerman, "The Great Mother of the Gods," Bulletin of the University of Wisconsin, Philology and Literature Series, 1, No. 3 (Madison, 1901), p. 226.

Ceres' large figure is symbolic of fruitful nature, and Pope's allusion to her as part of his composite Dulness is thus ironic. But Hecate's immense size is consistent with the immensity of evil and darkness associated with her, and by alluding to Hecate, Pope draws this darkness into the already dark world of the Dunciad. Dulness, like the Magna Mater, wears long robes and veils, and when seen "tinsel'd o'er in robes of varying hues" (1:81) she could be mistaken for Isis or Hecate.22 Pope suggests the presence of Isis in the pun, "nor wert thou, Isis! wanting to the day" (4:193), which of course directly alludes to Oxford University. But the goddess Isis is present throughout the Dunciad. Another obvious allusion to her occurs later in Book IV when the "Egyptian" Dunce, Mummius, is seen "Rattling an ancient Sistrum at his head" (1. 374). The sistrum is of course a primary attribute of Isis and was sounded by her worshippers in the celebration of her rites. Dulness' veils, of either fog (1:262) or cloth (4:336), link her to the veil- wearing goddesses: Nox; Death (when female); Vesta; and Diana of Ephesus, another nurturing maternal deity who is especially suggested by Dulness' epithet "nursing Mother" since this Diana is represented with a multitude of breasts.23 As he had with Ceres, Pope introduces irony by employing the epithet and the allusion to Diana of Ephesus. In contrast to the allusiveness of the references to these goddesses, Pope makes explicit the link between Berecynthia and Dulness: As Berecynthia, while her offspring vye In homage to the Mother of the sky, Surveys around her, in the blest abode, An hundred sons, and ev'ry son a God: Not with less glory mighty Dulness crown'd, Shall take thro' Grub-street her triumphant round; And her Parnassus glancing o'er at once, Behold an hundred sons, and each a Dunce. (3:131-138) Since "Berecynthian goddess" is sometimes used in place of the name Cybele or Magna Mater, Pope's comparison of Dulness to Berecynthia is equal to a comparison with the Magna Mater herself. This identification of Dulness with Berecynthia is further strengthened by the line referring to the Dunces, "A hundred head of Aristotle's friends" (4:192). Pope's reference to Berecynthia as "Mother of the sky," is, moreover, unusual; 22Apuleius The Golden Ass 11. 3. 23Montfaucon, 1:96-99; Banier, 1:222-224. Isis is also represented in a similar manner in Montfaucon, 2:175-176, 178. 225</page><page sequence="14">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Ovid describes her as descending from the sky in her lion-drawn chariot when her pines on Mt. Ida were burning, but this is an isolated account.24 Berecynthia does not have an epithet concerning the sky; rather Pope's addition here functions as a reference to the Magna Mater's origin in a falling meteoric stone. Pope's providing a "China Jordan" (2:165) or chamber pot as one of the prizes given by Dulness to the winner of the pissing contest is not without an iconographical parallel either. Cybele, as seen above, is some- times shown holding a pitcher or vase, but this feature is particularly characteristic of Ceres, Isis, and Vesta.25 Ceres, for example, is described as pouring water over the earth in order to fructify it.26 But whereas Ceres' pitcher is used in a life-giving act, Dulness'jordan is destined only for excrement. Indeed, Pope presents the goddess in the act of pouring at the beginning of the Dunciad. Say how the Goddess bade Britannia sleep, And pour'd her Spirit o'er the land and deep. (1:7-8) Thus the Dunciad opens with the foreshadowing of its apocalyptic ending: Dulness will pour from her excremental pitcher "'Till drown'd was Sense, and Shame, and Right, and Wrong-" (4:625), until "Universal Darkness buries All" (4:656). Dulness' "sacred Dome" (1:265) is symbolic not of the rotundity of the earth, as are Cybele's and Vesta's domed temples, but of her all- encompassing power of fog and darkness. The "black grottos" (2:98) of Dulness also suggest the caves and grottoes of Cybele, where she was worshiped, as well as in round temples.27 But the grottoes of Dulness are associated with the underwater caverns of the mud-nymphs (Merdamante is important here, since her name means "excrement-loving") and with the sewers, protected by Cloacina: Dulness' rites are not only performed in the misty darkness of caves, but with her votaries surrounded by excrement. Pope alludes to the Bona Dea, another earth goddess identified with the Magna Mater, in Book II of the Dunciad. Dulness is obviously the very antithesis of a "good goddess," and a comparison between these two is even more ironic than that between a benevolent earth goddess and one 24George Sandys, Ovid's Metamorphosis Englished, Mythologiz 'd, and Represented in Figures: An Essay to the Translation of Virgil's Aeneis (Oxford, 1632; rpt.

Pope first inverts the exclu- siveness and secrecy of the Bona Dea's ceremonies into the inclusiveness and exhibitionism of the cult and rites of Dulness. He then takes advan- tage of certain aspects of the Bona Dea's cult which are related to that of Dulness: the Bona Dea was worshiped at night, and when she was identi- fied with the old Roman goddess Maia, she was worshiped on May Day. Likewise, Dulness cherishes the night and honors the location of former May Day celebrations by holding her sacred games there: Amid that area wide they [Dunces] took their stand, Where the tall may-pole once o'er-look'd the Strand; But now (so ANNE and Piety ordain) A Church collects the saints of Drury-lane. (2:27-30) The conversion of the maypole site into a Christian church suits Pope's satiric and ironic purpose, most pointedly in the transformation of the Drury-Lane harlots into "the saints of Drury-lane." But in a much narrower sense the Dunces, as priests of one of the most primitive of pagan cults, dominate the area of former pagan worship which the Church now occupies, thus restoring the "church" to their paganism. Finally, Dulness is waging a frontal attack on civilization, aided by her "army" of Dunces, and it is not surprising to see many similarities between her cult and that of Bellona, goddess of war. Moreover, Bellona is sometimes confused with the Magna Mater and not simply associated with Mars. There is hardly any difference, in fact, between her priests, Fanatici, and the Galli of the Magna Mater. The Fanatici delight in noise and noisy processions, practice self-laceration, prophesy, and are usually led by one or more eunuchs.28 Juvenal paints a vivid picture of Bellona and the Fanatici: Bellona's Priests, an Eunuch at their Head, About the Streets a mad Procession lead; The Venerable Guelding, large, and high, O're-looks the Herd of his inferiour Fry. His awkward Clergy-Men about him prance; And beat the Timbrels to their Mystick Dance. Through yce they beat, and plunge into the Stream, If so the God has warn'd 'em in a Dream. Weak in their Limbs, but in Devotion strong, On their bare Hands and Feet they crawl along; 28Montf'aucon, 2:50, 165. 227</page><page sequence="16">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY A whole Fields length, the Laughter of the Throng.29 Dryden's translation here is remarkably close in spirit to Pope's herd of Dunces, who either "prance" or "crawl" through the Dunciad-at least when they are not asleep. The significant role played by sexual corruption in the Dunciad has been discussed by Patricia Meyer Spacks in An Argument of Images.30 There is certainly no lack of explicit references to sexual debauchery and excess, from the abortions surrounding the "creative" Cibber in Book I (11. 120-122) and the mud-nymphs' polluted "bower of bliss" (2:332-336), to the "sons of sons of sons of whores" in Book IV (1. 332). But Pope has made the theme of sexual licentiousness implicit simply through his choice of the Magna Mater as the prototype of Dulness. The rites of the Magna Mater or Cybele were infamous for their licentiousness, but they were by no means the most extravagant.3" Banier describes the rites of Cotytto, the "Goddess of Debauchery," whose presence is also implicit in Pope's composite Dulness: "they [Cotytto's priests] must have carried Debauchery very far, since Juvenal, who paints them to the Life with one Stroke, says, they tired out their Goddess Cotytto, though she was the Goddess of Lewdness."32 These priests, Baptae, were looked upon as very vile men, noted for their uncontrolled, obscene rites in honor of Cotytto. The obscenity of Cotytto's cult is seen in the unnatural sexual activity of Dulness' cult, from the unnatural coupling of literary genres (1: 69-70), the "insect lust" of the Dunces (4:415), and the allusion to homosexuality in the line "Behold yon Pair, in strict embraces join'd" (3:179), to the incestuous birth of Dulness herself, who is the "Daughter of Chaos and eternal Night" (1:12). Hesiod's and most other accounts give Night as the daughter of Chaos, and Pope expands on the implicit incestuous origin of his goddess through her own incestuous relationship with her sons, the Dunces (4:19-20, 71-84).33 Even the presence of so many asses adds to the sexual imagery, since they were thought by the ancients to be especially lustful animals and are often associated with the cult of Bacchus.34 The presence of Silenus (4:491ff), whose ass interrupted an 29'"The Satires of DecimusJuniusjuvenalis," the Sixth Satire, ll. 658-663, 675-679, in The Poems of John Dryden, ed.

Immediately following Dulness' anointing of Cibber, her bird, "(a monster of a fowl, / Something betwixt a Heideggre and owl,)" (1:289-290), miraculously lights on Cibber's head. As a sacred bird, the owl is as fitting an attribute of Dulness as of Nox and Hecate. Besides the common association of owls with night, Ross in his Mystagogus Poeticus says that originally the owl was an incestuous woman who for punishment was changed by Minerva into that bird.36 Since Dulness is herself an incestuous woman, it is no wonder that she is particularly fond of the owl, nor that the Dunces, with their incestuous relationship with Dulness, are referred to as owls (3:166). Sleep is an important aspect of Dulness' empire, as is evident through- out the Dunciad, particularly as seen in the sleeping contest. If the literary works of the Dunces are not sufficient to induce sleep, Dulness has a ready supply of opium. And for the Dunce who is gifted with sleep- inspiring talent a wreath of poppies, like Shadwell's (3:22), is waiting. The poppy wreath is also a symbol of Nox (and of Sleep himself) but is often associated with Ceres, because of her sleeplessness after the abduction of her daughter.37 With sleep come dreams and visions: Nox is followed by "darkling dreams"; Isis is especially noted for the dreams of prophecy which she sends her priests and initiates; and a temple was built expressly to "Hecate, who presides over Dreams."38 Indeed, Dulness follows the practice of Isis in sending the vision of her future empire to Settle, who in turn reveals it to Cibber (3:43ff). And like Hecate, Dulness watches over her sleeping followers, who, satiated after the day's festivities, "Yet eat, in dreams, the custard of the day" (1:92). If the Dunces' gluttony is insufficient at City feasts during their waking hours, Dulness-and Night-will insure that their consumption increases in their dreams. Finally, Dulness' "healing mist" (1:174), the "forms in clouds, or visions of the night" (2:112) which she conjures up, and her mild, creeping vapors (4:615) all serve to link her with the dream-related goddesses and strengthen, of course, her preference for caverns and grottoes, where mist and vapors are naturally found. :35Ovid Fasti 6. 319-348. 36Ross, pp. 322-323. 370vid Fasti 4. 551-552; Met. 11. 605-607; Banier, 1:264, 3:67. 388Ovid Fasti 4. 662; Apuleius 11. 15-16, 21-22; Banier, 1:345, 4:245. 229</page><page sequence="18">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Moreover, Pope clearly equates Dulness with Nox in Book I: Here pleas'd behold her mighty wings out-spread To hatch a new Saturnian age of Lead. (11. 27-28) In alluding to the image of the primitive egg in the Orphic myth of creation, the "mighty wings" can only refer to "black-winged Night" who, without a mate, laid the egg from which Eros-the principle of love and father of all the immortal gods-emerged.39 But love is not born in the Dunciad. Pope's inversion of the nativity of Eros into the birth of the Age of Lead is perfectly consistent with the Dunces' sexual debauchery: whoring is the norm; true love is dead. And the wings with which Dulness will gather again her "fav'rite Isle, long sever'd from her reign" (3:125) are also the wings of Death: the sleep Dulness wishes for Britannia is the sleep of death, the final all-burying darkness. The long black robe or veil usually worn by Nox, in addition to her wings, is common to the personification of evil things in Renaissance iconography. In his description of the personification of "Obstinacy," for example, Cesare Ripa uses much of the same imagery as does Pope: Obstinacy is A Woman all in black; her Head surrounded with a Cloud; holding an Ass's Head with both her Hands. Black denotes Obstinacy, because it will take no other Colour; so an opiniona- tive Man will never be beat out of his Error. The Clouds denote the short-sight of the obstinate, that makes them so stiff, that they will look no farther. The Ass shews that gross Ignorance is the Mother of it.40 It may not seem logical that Nox is part of the composite Dulness, since she is her mother, but this sort of confusion is exactly what is found in the mythographers; Montfaucon himself complains of such contradictions, saying "we must not require bare Possibility, much less Probability, in the Accounts of these Things. "41 But since Pope's creation is an artistic one and since Dulness connotes darkness, chaos, and death, the presence of Nox and even the older Chaos is not incompatible with his total design, and her presence adds to the complex web of allusions and imagery. Indeed King, Montfaucon, and Banier quote Orpheus' description of Nox as "Mother of the Gods and Men," also an epithet of the Magna Mater. 42 39Aristophanes The Birds 693-702.

Pope parallels the procession of Dunces on their way to the site of the mud-diving contest, with a "large tribute of dead dogs" (2:272) rolling toward the Thames; at their turn, the Dunces plunge like a "desp'rate pack" and bob up and down like "puppies in the mud" (2:305, 308). The priests that howl and the dogs that bark at the arrival of Hecate are not very different from the Dunces: "Ralph to Cynthia howls" (3: 165) refers not merely to the moon, but also to Hecate, who was sometimes confused with Diana Luna; and as Trivia or Diana Hecate, she is sometimes called Cynthia.43 The dog imagery also relates rabid madness, induced by the "Dog-star's unpropitious ray" (4:9), thieves and scavengers, circus performances, cynic philosophers who care for no one, and sacrifices (of dogs' entrails) to the malignant goddess Robigo or Mildew." Hecate adds, too, the dimension of the infernal regions to the general darkness and death pervading the Dunciad. Regarded as an enchantress and sorcerer, Hecate is suggested by the magic associated with Cybele's cult (see below) and by that practiced by the Dunces, who use excrement as "magic juices" (2:104). Dulness gives a "magic gift" to Curll, whereby "Cook shall be Prior, and Concanen, Swift" (2:138), so that the Dunces will be able to boast of their "Garth and Addison" (2:140). Sandys, in his Ovid's Metamorphosis (1626), attributes "Charmes, and Magick Arts" to Hecate; he also mentions that "baneful weeds" and "poys'nous weeds" are associated with her.45 This is recalled in the Dunciad when the Dunces are shown crowned with "weeds and shells" (4:398)-thus extending the range and complexity of allusion far beyond the obvious attack on ignorant dilettantism in natural history. Dragons are usually said to pull Hecate's chariot, and Settle prophesies a similar vehicle for Cibber: "On grinning dragons thou shalt mount the wind" (3:268)-yet once more taking the range of allusion beyond the trivial and contemporary allusion to Settle's "Dragon of green leather of his own invention" which Pope gleefully points to in his note to the Dunciad Variorum (3:281). But there are still more allusions to Hecate: as Trivia (an obvious pun by Pope) she presides over streets and ways, where the procession of Dulness takes place. In a description of her feasts, King 42King, p. 199; Montfaucon, 1:227; Banier, 2:429. 43Ross, p. 152; Lucian The Lover of Lies, or, The Doubter 22; John Gay uses the name Cynthia interchangeably with Trivia in his Trivia (1716), 3:1-4, a poem criticized byJames Ralph. Pope is here not only characterizing Ralph as a mad dog howling at the moon but is also referring to Ralph's "howling criticism" of Gay's work. 44James Hall, Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art (London, 1974), p. 105; J.

For the former Reasons she was esteemed the Protectress of Vagabonds and Debtors.46 Finally, Hecate's daughter, Circe, is present in the Dunciad to work reverse magic, and Cloacina both brings in sewer imagery-another dark, underground region-and parallels the figure of Corina, a harpy- like woman. And with Eliza Haywood, "yon Juno of majestic size, / With cow-like udders, and with ox-like eyes" (2:163-164), the prize for the winner of the pissing contest, and her "Two babes of love close clinging to her waist" (2:158), Pope iconographically alludes to the figures of Nox, Sleep, and Death. An often-encountered description of Nox is that of a statue posed in a manner similar to that of Eliza: King, for example, observes that amongst the Eleans there was a Temple with the Statue of a Woman, that held two Boys asleep, in the right Hand a white one, and in the Left a black, having both of them their Legs distorted; the Inscription purported, that one of them was Sleep, the other Death, and the Female that nourished them was Night.47 It has already been clearly established that the attributes of these pagan goddesses are interrelated with the rites and forms of worship performed by their priests and consequently with the general character and reputation of their cults. With the exception of Nox and Hecate, all of the goddesses whom Pope incorporates into his composite figure of Dulness had cults and priests.48 Just as Dulness is an amalgam of many goddesses and their attributes, so, too, her cult and her priests, the Dunces, are based on a variety of pejorative descriptions of the cults of goddesses and their priests given by classical writers and later mythographers. The Galli, mendicant priests of Cybele, were eunuchs. Castration was part of the initiation ceremonies into her cult. Their name derives from the River Gallus, whose waters were said to induce madness and frenzy.49 46King, pp. 92-93. 47King, p. 200; Banier, 3:99. 48King, p. 200, describes Nox as "a most rigid Deity" unmoved by prayers; hence there is no need for priests or ceremonies. Hecate, like the other infernal deities, has no formal cult; it is only when she is taken as (Hecate) Trivia or as Diana Trivia that she is mentioned as being worshiped. 49Ovid Fasti 4. 361-366. 233</page><page sequence="22">I W9~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 7 DIANA OF EPHESUS; HER TURRETED CROWN, VEIL, AND LIONS LINK HER WITH CYBELE, WHILE LOTUS FLOWERS (BOTTOM OF COLUMNS) SHOW CONFUSION WITH ISIS.

The chief priest, the Archi- gallus, wore the same bonnet and a long purple mantle. Not only were the initiation ceremonies accompanied by ecstatic dancing, the clashing of cymbals, and the beating of the tympanum, but the Magna Mater's processions through towns or about the countryside, for which the Galli placed her statue upon an ass and led it about, were also accompanied by great noise. Her priests, in procession and while celebrating the mysterious rites, slashed their arms and whipped each other's backs with knives and swords. Her sacrifices, always held secretly, were held to be obscene, even orgiastic, in nature. Classical writers looked upon the cult as generally offensive and lewd, and described the sexless priests as tricksters, vagabonds, and swindlers. Although the cult of the Magna Mater was the only one in Rome that the State allowed to collect money for its support, the manner of collection was frequently described as trickery or theft, for purely personal gain.50 Priestesses are rarely men- tioned, but Montfaucon briefly mentions an archpriestess.5' Finally, just as the Magna Mater is confused with other goddesses, so, too, are her priests: they are termed Galli in most accounts, but are also called Cory- bantes, Cabir, Idaei Dactili, Curetes, and Telchines-sometimes by several names in one account. In discussing the Corybantes, for example, Banier implies that at least two of these names are interchangeable: As for the Corybantes, these were Priests of Cybele, who in the Mysteries of that Goddess leap'd and danced about her, and made a wild kind of Noise with their Arms. . . . The Worship of Cybele became famous, especially in Phrygia; her Festivals there were solemnized with great Uproar: The Priests rrmaking a Din of their Tabrets to resound, and striking their Bucklers with Spears, danced and made several strange Contorsions with their Heads and whole Body, whence they got the Name of Corybantes: With these they mingled S[h]rieks and Howlings to deplore the Death of Atys, to whose Punishment those wretched Priests volun- tarily submitted. They were called Galli, and the High Priest Archigallus.52 As for the Telchines, King states that they "were reported to have been Magicians, able to transform themselves into divers Shapes, and to raise Winds and Tempests at their Pleasure, others thought them Daemons presiding over the Winds.' 53 Lucretius describes the procession of the "Great Mother of the Gods" and gives her priests the names "Galli," and "Curetes" (their Greek name), while Statius, one of Pope's favorite 50Montfaucon, 1:5-6, 2:8-10, the "Law of the Twelve Tablets." 51Montfaucon, 2:10-11. 52Banier, 2:560-563. 53King, pp. 24-25; see also Ovid Met. 7. 365. 235</page><page sequence="24">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY authors, says of them, "like the Berecynthian mother, while she bids the Curetes leap in excited dance around the infant Thunderer; their cymbals clash in emulous frenzy, but Ide resounds with his loud wailings."54 From just these few writers' and compilers' accounts of Cybele-Magna Mater and her priests, many similarities are readily seen between them and Dulness and the Dunces. The first and most obvious parallel exists between the eunuch priests of the Magna Mater and the intellectual ''eunuchs" who serve Dulness. But although the Dunces are incapable of producing literary and scholarly works, they are quite capable of producing noise; consequently the Galli echo in the Dunciad's cacophony. Dulness herself enjoins her "Galli" to learn "the wond'rous pow'r of Noise" (2:222): To move, to raise, to ravish ev'ry heart, With Shakespeare's nature, or with Johnson's art, Let others aim: 'Tis yours to shake the soul With Thunder rumbling from the mustard bowl, With horns and trumpets now to madness swell, Now sink in sorrows with a tolling bell; Such happy arts attention can command, When fancy flags, and sense is at a stand. Improve we these. Three Cat-calls be the bribe Of him, whose chatt'ring shames the Monkey tribe: And his this Drum, whose hoarse heroic base Drowns the loud clarion of the braying Ass.' (2:223-234) So swells each wind-pipe; Ass intones to Ass, Harmonic twang! of leather, horn, and brass; Such as from lab'ring lungs th' Enthusiast blows, High Sound, attemp'red to the vocal nose; Or such as bellow from the deep Divine. (2:253-257) The prominence of asses in the Dunciad, for example, in the passage quoted above, recalls that in the processions of the cult of the Magna Mater, her blocklike statue was carried upon an ass-just as the owl sits upon the many books weighing down the ass in the frontispiece to the Dunciad Variorum.55 Pope's visual description of the Dunces is also drawn 54Lucretius De Rer. Nat. 2. 598-660 (See also Homeric Hymns 14; Ovid Fasti 4. 179-192, 201-210); Statius, trans. J. H. Mozley, Loeb Classical Library, 2 vols. (London, 1928), Thebaid 4. 782-785. Here Statius identifies Cybele with Rhea; cf. Achilleid 1. 827-832. Lucian gives a similar description of Rhea but with the Corybantes in The Dance 8, and he applies part or all of this description to the Galli and the Corybantes (who dance on Cybele's mountain) in The Goddess of Syria 15, 27, 44, 50-54, and Gout 30, respectively. 236</page><page sequence="25">SOURCES OF POPE'S DULNESS in terms similar to those used by classical writers in describing the priests of the Magna Mater in performance of their grotesque rites and especially when in procession, escorting the ass bearing the blocklike image of their goddess. Pope's picture portrays the Dunces as "an endless band" (2:19), A motley mixture! in long wigs, in bags, In silks, in crapes, in Garters, and in rags. (2:21-22) This description of the fantastic costumes of the fops, dandies, and vaga- bonds alludes to the Roman Saturnalia, the festival in which the partici- pants specially dressed in various attires unlike those of their real stations in society. Such allusions to the Saturnalia, celebrating of course the reign of Saturn, reinforce the Dunciad's major theme: the return to leaden times. Another reference to this Roman festival is found in Settle's prophetic picture of the Britain to come: Behold yon' Isle, by Palmers, Pilgrims trod, Men bearded, bald, cowl'd, uncowl'd, shod, unshod, Peel'd, patch'd, and pyebald, linsey-wolsey brothers, Grave Mummers! sleeveless some, and shirtless others. (3:113-116) Additionally, the phrase "a gay embroider'd race" (4:275), used by Pope to describe a tribe of rakes and fops, alludes to the robes of the newly initiated priests of Isis.56 And even the long mantles of the Galli drape the Dunces-as seen, for example, in the long robe of Smedley, who is described as "The rev'rend Flamen in his lengthen'd dress" (2:354). Pope's detailing of the traits of the Dunces, especially their interest in gaming, trickery, and magic also has its origin in the practices of the Galli. Cibber's gambling habits are alluded to in Book I, where he is despairing because of "an ill Run at Play" (1. 113). He sinks to an even lower point and "Blasphem'd his Gods, the Dice, and damn'd his Fate" (1:116). But gaming is not confined to the impoverished haunts of ordinary Dunces, for "Gaming and Grub-street skulk behind the King" (1:310). Duncelike debauchery is present at Court in the form of the "Hazard Table" found "wherever the Court resides."57 And Annius' "prayer" characterizes his "brazen, brainless brothers": 55Apparently no one has pointed out the similarity between Lucian's description of his carrying the heavy statue of the Dea Syria on his back while in his metamorphosed state of an ass (Lucius, or, The Ass 41) and the frontispiece of the Dunciad Variorum (1729). Lucian explains that he could be changed back into a man by eating roses.

(4:355-356) Like the Telchines and the Galli, who were often accused of using magic and charms, the Dunces are enamored of magic. After giving advice to his "sons," Settle mentions the "charms" that please the goddess and her priests, and on turning aside, he sees the sudden appearance of a "sable Sorc'rer" (3:229, 233). He then tells of the "magic charms" of Dulness, sent by her angel to cover "all unclassic ground," while "New wizards" are seen to rise (3:257-258, 266).58 As the catalog of the similarities of Dulness' Dunces to the Magna Mater's Galli lengthens, it becomes apparent that mythographic descrip- tions of the latter are quite applicable to the former. Montfaucon, for example, writes of the Galli that they "were generally infamous Villains, who abused the Simplicity of the common People" and that they were sometimes "detected in several abominable Crimes. 59 For Lucian, the Galli are "mountebanks" and "effeminate fellows" who beg alms and steal whenever they can get away with it, and Banier, citing Firmicus, writes that the Corybantes-Cabiri honored murder in their mysteries, concluding that "Whoever . . . has a Mind to shed the Blood of his Brother, may participate in the Mysteries of the Corybantes. "60 So, too, Pope's Dunces are prepared to participate even in such excesses.

(2:355-358)61 Montfaucon sums up nicely what the general opinion of the Galli seems to have been, an opinion very similar to that of Pope regarding the Dunces, who "provoke" their own "Glory, and Gain" (2:33): the Galli were not Priests of Cybele: They were indeed, says [M. Vandale], People consecrated to the Great Mother; but they were Ramblers, Cheats, who went from Town to Town, playing upon Cymbals and Crotala, who carry'd about Images of the Syrian Goddess, to impose upon poor People and get Alms, which turn'd to their Profit.

Be that as it will, these Galli, who carry'd about the Mother of the Gods to get Alms, were wicked Vagabonds; and as part of their Trade was singing Verses over all the Country, by this means, says Plutarch, (Moral. 407) they rendered Poetry very despicable. These People, says he, deliver'd Oracles; some extempore, others by Lots thrown into certain Books; they sold them to servants and silly Women; and this Sort of People were charm'd with these Oracles in Verse and Rhime. These Wizards, says he, destroy'd the true Oracles pronounc'd from the Tripod .62 Plutarch's denunciation of the "poetic" Galli applies perfectly to the equally "poetic" Dunces, who worship the "false Apollo." They have destroyed the sacred tripod of the true Apollo, just as they have polluted his Castalian springs and defamed all Parnassus .63 Attys, the consort of Cybele, and the Archigallus, her high priest, have their counterparts in the Dunciad. As seen earlier, Cibber stands in relation to Dulness as Attys does to Cybele; in at least one account, indeed, Attys is taken for the son of Cybele. Thus Attys as son; beloved "swain"; and unchaste priest is transformed into Cibber the son; Cibber the swain (see above, p. 221); Cibber the newly initiated priest (1: 273ff), over whose "anointed head" Dulness pours the "sacred Opium" (1:287-288); and Cibber the unchaste priest, whose "chastity" is lost to Dulness herself (4:20). In fact the phrase "Our Midas sits Lord Chancellor of Plays!" (3:324), which Settle uses to describe him, strengthens Cibber's role as son (since in some accounts Midas is identi- fied as Cybele's son) as well as pointing to the ass imagery which pervades the poem.64 The Dunces are in fact little Midases in their "scarlet hats" (2:14)-the kind of hat Midas wore to hide his asses' ears, as told by Ovid: "He strives to cover such a foule defame: / And with a red Tiara hides his shame."65 62 Montfaucon, 2:9. 63Petersen, p. 440, uses the epithet "the false Apollo" for the Dunces' god. With the motto from Ovid which opens the Dunciad as his point of departure, Petersen discusses the thread of Apollonian imagery which runs through the poem. This "active Apollonian presence" (p. 435) is introduced by the motto, he maintains, supporting his argument by citing Renaissance mythographies. Apollo as the god of music and poetry, healing, justice, and generally a harmonious world order is, of course, a fitting divinity to stand with Pope against Dulness. The Dunces, too, worship Apollo (3:224) but, Petersen says, "they have repeatedly rejected him and profaned his symbols and rites" (p. 440). This profanation of Apollo culminates with the crowning of Cibber as the Dunces' Apollo. Thus the Dunces worship the "false Apollo" because they have continually profaned the true. 64Banier, 2:403; cf. Hyginus Fabulae 191. Pope's familiarity with Hyginus' Fabulae is evident from his many references to it in his Odyssey. 65Sandys, Ovid's Met. 1. 182-183. Sandys explains the "Tiara" as "An ornament for the head, worne of old by the Easterne Princes, much like a Turkish Turbant." 239</page><page sequence="28">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Settle hails Cibber as "our own true Phoebus" (3:323), but he is actually the "false Apollo," and this identification establishes another link with the Attys myth. Montfaucon states that Attys was taken by some to mean the Sun, a comparison with Apollo which only serves to show how very inferior a figure the frenetic Attys makes when placed beside the dignified Parnassian.66 With the emergence of Cibber-Attys as the Dunces' Apollo, the values of darkness, discord, physical weakness and illness, false judgment, deceit, and false poetry are preferred to the values of the true Apollo: light, harmony, strength and healing, fair judgment, truth, and true poetry. Cibber's identification with Midas is sufficient to indicate his blindness and inability to recognize the true Apollo. But Pope removes all doubt of Cibber's being the "false Apollo," and his use of the Attys myth is certainly one of the richest in associations. Attys is of course mentioned explicitly by Pope in reference to inauthentic ancient coins (4:363), and the "Syrian Prince(s)" in the lines which follow (4:368, 375) refers either to coins or medals, as explained in the notes to these lines by Pope and Warburton. Since the mythic Attys is described as Syrian, Lydian, or Phrygian by birth, Pope is able here to veil a very real presence and connection with the Magna Mater beneath the surface of false coins.67 Moreover, it is not coincidental that Attys should be mentioned at this point. As usual, Pope is well aware of the layers of association with which he is working: the links between the Attys, follower of the Magna Mater-Dulness and worshipper of false values; the Attys of false coins; and the Cibber-Attys, the false Apollo, all are based on falsehood, deceit, and the perversion of values. Although Pope is probably referring to Walpole as the "High Priest of Dulness"-the "Magus" and "Wizzard Old"-who in Book IV will initiate the assembly of Dunces into the goddess' "greater Mysteries" (4:517n), Walpole is not really convincing as a high priest or Archigallus. Rather, it is Settle, the spiritual "Father" of the Dunces, who occupies the role of the Archigallus of the Magna Mater-Dulness. His paternal counsel (especially in 3:213-224) is very much like that which an Archi- gallus might have given to his newly initiated Galli, and his prophecy of their future "blessed" empire is quite similar to that given by the high priest of Isis to Lucius in The Golden Ass.68 Settle's prophecy (3:236-240) does not, however, echo the illumination of Isis' divine presence, but rather the reenactment of Ovid's battle of the Giants (who have one 66Montfaucon, 1:10. 67Montfaucon, 1:10, taken from Lucian.

In the Second Satire, Juvenal observes that You will hear [at her ceremonies] all the foul talk and squeaking tones of Cybele; a gray-haired frenzied old man presides over the rites; he is a rare and notable master of mighty gluttony, and should be hired to teach it. But why wait any longer when it were time in Phrygian fashion to lop off the superfluous flesh?70 Pope's parody of the Epic Games in Book II contains important allusions to the games and festivals of the Magna Mater, the Saturnalia, and the initiation feast of Ceres, and to an inverted image of Orpheus. The Magna Mater's festival and games, the Megalesia or Megalesian Days, were, according to Ovid, the first of the year.71 A chariot race was part of the Megalesia (satirized by Juvenal) but the festival which certainly must have stirred Pope's imagination is the Hilaria or "Festival of Joy. "72 The name itself and its attendant merriment is reflected in the Dunciad's tickling contest, but the essence of the festival is expressed in the processions of strangely attired and "fantastic crown'd" Dunces, a feature held in common with the Saturnalia.73 Due to the fact that it was celebrated at the time of the vernal equinox (in March), when the lengthening hours of sunlight begin to exceed those of night, the festival was associated with Attys the Sun, which for Pope serves as another precedent for the Dunces' worship of the "false Apollo" and the profaning of the true one. There is also a similarity between a practice in the Hilaria and the Dunces' offering of gifts to Dulness ("Each with some wond'rous gift approach'd the Pow'r" [4:399]), for Banier speaks of the celebrants carrying in procession whatever they had that was "fine or curious" in their houses.74 But one of the more significant relationships 69Sandys, Ovid's Met. 1. 151-155: And that the Heavens their safety might suspect, The Gyants now coelestiall Thrones affect; Who to the skies congested mountains reare, Then Jove with thunder did Olympus teare; Steepe Pelion from under Ossa thrown.

Lucian's account of the Saturnalia is clearly one of Pope's sources for the contests of the Dunces. According to Lucian, the Saturnalia marks the time of the year, December, when Cronos (Saturn) returns to earth for a reign of seven days; drinking, shouting, and dice games are freely encour- aged, and Saturn too takes part. Servants and their masters change places, the latter waiting on and serving the former. As Saturn tells his priest, he himself is allowed to "sing stark naked, clap and shake, and sometimes even get pushed head-first into cold water with my face smeared with soot. "76 And the "laws for banquets" set the bathing time after the "nuts and gaming" of the feast.77 By mentioning the month of December ("In cold December fragrant chaplets blow, / And heavy harvests nod beneath the snow" [1:77-78]), Pope utilizes the allusion to the Saturnalia to reinforce his satire on incongruities in the literary productions of the Dunces.78 The pissing contest particularly alludes to the initiation feast of Ceres, as described by Banier, and other aspects of this feast are reflected throughout the games.79 The initiation into Ceres' mysteries lasted nine days and included a procession of female initiates carrying small boxes of cakes, wool, pomegranates, and poppies. "Loud Exclamations of Joy and Dancing" accompanied the parading of the statue of a young man, brought beforehand from Eleusis to Athens, followed by gymnastic games the next day. The last day was consecrated to the filling of two vessels with sacred water and when these were later emptied, to the accompani- ment of priestly incantations, the earth was believed to be supplicated for rain and fertility and "that Day was termed Plemechoe', a Word importing an earthen Vessel flat at Bottom. " However, the most important allusion suggested by the pissing contest is to Roman and early Christian representations of Orpheus as a fountain ornament. Martial writes that "one can see on the Esquiline, after cross- ing the Subura, Orpheus wet with spray at the crown of the drenched 75Showerman, p. 279, citing Ovid Fasti 4. 339ff; Lucretius De Rer.

'80 This allusion to the "drenching of Orpheus" is of especial significance in relation to the recent recognition of the role of Orpheus in the poem. In "Orpheus and the Dunciad's Narrator," John V. Regan discusses the similarities between the bard and the poem's narrator.81 In particular, he finds that the death of Orpheus at the hands of the frenzied Thracian women is similar to the situation of the Dunciad's narrator. He points out that Orpheus' song-which had previously tamed wild beasts and ushered in civilized behavior generally-was stifled by the wild enthu- siasm of the Bacchanals. Regan cites Ovid's account of Orpheus' death, which is of especial importance, for the murderous women are described as "howling Bacchanals" accompanied by the clamor of "Berecynthian shalmes. "82 The Bacchanals are essentially the same as the followers of the Magna Mater: their object is to destroy poetry and harmony and to restore chaos. In the light, therefore, of the Apollonian and Orphic imagery and allusions already recognized in the Dunciad, the implicit allusion to Orpheus' fountain statue in the pissing contest renders poig- nantly ironic the libations the Dunces pay to the legendary bard and to poetry in general. Four lines of the Dunciad which have remained obscure, although their source in, and parody of, Virgil have been noted by both Pope and Sutherland, not only provide additional evidence of the presence of the Magna Mater, but reveal the relationship of this body of myth to the basic theme of Pope's work. They occur in the long prayer consecrating the votive offering of his works which Cibber offers up to Dulness: Yet sure had Heav'n decreed to save the State, Heav'n had decreed these works a longer date. Could Troy be sav'd by any single hand, This grey-goose weapon must have made her stand. (1:195-198) As Aubrey Williams points out, Pope has made the translatio theme quite clear by following the basic structure of the Aeneid, with the transfer of the Trojan empire to Rome. But by incorporating the cult of the Magna Mater, he adds the dimension of the transfer of a debauched "empire" to 8OToynbee, p. 290, translates these lines from Martial Epigrams 10. 19. 6-8. 8lEighteenth-Century Studies, 9 (1975), 87-101. 82Sandys, Ovid's Met. 11. 16-17: Of Berecynthian shalmes, clapt hands, loud cryes, Drummes, howling Bacchanals, with frantick sound.

Contrary to Williams' thesis, Pope is not simply inverting the Aeneid's translatio theme; he is artistically molding a new myth which incorporates actual Roman history. As has already been established, the Magna Mater's statue was nothing but a black stone which fell to the earth near Pessinus; her origin is thus Asiatic. From the Aeneid it is learned that she desired to accompany the Trojans on their journey to Italy after the fall of Troy, but it was not yet the fated time for her to leave Mt. Ida.83 The propitious time did come in 205-204 B.C., during the Second Punic War. On consulting the Sibyl- line Books, the Romans learned that they would always stay free from foreign invasion and conquest if they would bring the Magna Mater to Rome, and further inquiry of the Delphic oracle confirmed this.84 Thus "Heav'n decreed" to save the Roman state, and the "single hand" was that of the Magna Mater. An embassy was sent to effect the transfer, and the Magna Mater began her Roman residency in 204 B.C. Subsequently, a temple dedicated to her on the Palatine was opened in 191 B.C.85 Her cult, and those of most other mother goddesses, was accepted by the populace after modifications were made to suit their Roman-less frenetic -temperament. Even so, the upper classes were horrified at the cult's excesses. Nevertheless, the cult remained entrenched, though always under State control, and was among the last to give way to Christian domination in Italy.86 The fact that the cult of the Magna Mater was a major one of several externa sacra is also important; the other major externum sacrum was the Thracian cult of Bacchus, a cult which entered Rome clandestinely, engendered vast immorality, and culminated in the 185 B.C. Bacchanalia where the debauchery was so great, even among the Roman nobility, that the State suppressed the cult, and throughout Italy priests and priestesses were arrested.87 Thus, the allusions to the cult of Bacchus in the Dunciad- ivy, asses, Silenus, wine, and sexual debauchery-form a parallel with those to the cult of the Magna Mater and reinforce the excesses of the latter through their association. Indeed, the comparison of the two cults not only reveals their similarities, but throws their differences into sharper relief: the intoxication of wine inherent in the cult of Bacchus is far less horrifying than the intoxication of blood found in the cult of the Magna Mater. 83Virgil Aeneid 9. 80ff; Ovid Fasti 4. 251-254. 84Showerman, p. 225.

But not quite "finally" banished: for after a period of evolution in the Christian West, including the Renaissance of learning and art, the pagan cult has returned in full power for its reestablishment in England. The Dunces belong to such a primitive "cult": they have reverted to object animism, dark and unreasoning rites, and general debauchery. Western values are hopelessly dying. Pope's choice of this myth is also consistent with his view of Augustus, for the latter was by no means unimportant in regard to the life of the Magna Mater's cult during his reign.88 Augustus was especially inter- ested in reviving and purifying the religious cults in an effort to curb moral decay, hoping thus to unite morality and religion. He also wished to unify the old Roman cults with their superimposed Greek elements. He revived rites where they had fallen into disuse, and restored and rebuilt about eighty temples. The Magna Mater's temple was one of these, but Augustus' motive was to Romanize-that is, to civilize-the cult. About this time, too, Augustus selected Apollo as his patron deity and had a new temple built and dedicated to Apollo. Horace began composing odes in Apollo's honor and in them linked Apollo's name with Augustus. Concomitant with this revival went deliberate suppression of the Oriental-enthusiastic-ele- ments and cults. For example, the Isis cult, whose Egyptian origin associ- ated her with Antony and Cleopatra, was suppressed. As Cyril Bailey explains, The Augustan religious revival was not merely an attempt to re-establish the Old Roman religion in its Graeco-Roman anthropomorphic dress, but on its negative 88The status of the Magna Mater and her cult under Augustus has been disputed by classical scholars and archaeologists. However, the simplistic opinions that "the poets of the Golden Age were kindly disposed towards the Goddess" and that "in the national religious reformation of Augustus the cult of Cybele was no alien intruder; she belonged to the ancient heritage," most recently stated by Maarten J. Vermaseren in Cybele and Attis. the Myth and the Cult (London, 1977), p. 86, do not stand up under searching analysis. As G. Karl Galinsky points out, interest in Asiatic cults was increasing under Augustus for political reasons: to bolster the national consciousness quickened by the Aeneid's celebration of the Trojan translatio and to further Roman pretensions to the Hellenistic East. Moreover, Galinsky says, "once her great eastern opponents had been overcome, the usefulness of the legend for political and cultural objectives of the state was exhausted." And he further observes that "in the case of the Magna Mater, the Roman nobility in fact was appalled by the cult as such, demonstratively ignored it, and treated the appeals of Asian cities in the name of Cybele and her priests with an attitude of reserve bordering on rejection"; see Aeneas, Sicily, and Rome (Princeton, 1969), pp. 187-188. 245</page><page sequence="34">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY side an exclusion of the new emotional cults. This is clear not merely from their total omission from his scheme, but from acts of explicit suppression.89 Even in his literary taste, Augustus reveals his anti-Asiatic feelings, for example, in asking if one would rather imitate the "Asiatic orators," who were associated with a meaningless and verbose style, than Annius Cimber or Veranius Flaccus and the Attic school of oratory, which stressed careful simplicity.90 Pope's ideal of an Augustan Age has thus been destroyed by the transfer of the empire of Dulness to England. Politically this translatio was achieved by the Hanoverian succession and culturally through the agency of the Dunces-the hack writers and journalists supported by the new bourgeois reign and the ever-increasing influence of the commercial social and economic class. Instead of a new and hoped-for golden Saturnian Age in England, the Age of Lead begins; instead of an emperor like Augustus, King Cibber and George II appear. Thus, the cult of the Magna Mater, like the Aeneid, provides Pope with a basic foundation to support literary and political allusions to his own time. By taking the Magna Mater and the various associated goddesses identified with her as the prototype of his own "Magna Mater," Pope has rendered Dulness larger and more terrible than she may at first appear. 89Bailey, p. 189. 9OSuetonius The Deified Augustus 86. 3. 246</page></plain_text>
