BRIDGET KENNEDY BALINT-Hildebert of Lavardin's 'Liber de queri- monia' in its cultural context T HE Liber de querimonia et conflictu animae et corporis by Hilde- bert of Lavardin (1056-1133) is a text that raises more questions than it answers. In this dissertation I trace the origins of those questions and their status in intellectual discourse at the turn of the twelfth cen- tury. By presenting the Liber de querimonia as a forward-looking tex- tual experiment, I hope to reveal a lesser-known facet of Hildebert's intellectual engagement with his times. The Liber de querimonia (DeQ) is a dialogue between Anima, representing the soul, and "Hildebert," representing the body, framed as a vision experienced by Hildebert the bishop. The DeQ is constructed as a prosimetrum, with ten alternating sections of prose and verse, which allow the author to demonstrate his considerable literary skills while addressing the question of whether the body or the soul is responsible for a person's sin. It is an innovative and unique piece of writing from around the year 1100, showing stylistic traits that would become part of the common literary topography of the twelfth century, for example, the use of allegorical personifications to address philosophical questions, and, on a smaller scale, a predilection for antithesis and paradox. The form and matter of the DeQ are the result of a confluence of a number of different cultural currents. In order to gain an understanding of the sources and destinations of these currents, and just how they function in the DeQ, I examine the text from four different points of view. First, I consider ideas about the body and the soul in the medieval West before the great wave of Latin translations of Aristotle, and how Hildebert struggles with their implicit paradoxes. The tools at his disposal for considering questions of body and soul, the arts of language, are controversial at the time he is writ- ing; the changing nature of education in the late eleventh century, and the various ways Hildebert uses the arts of the trivium in the DeQ make</page><page sequence="2">490 Summaries of Dissertations up the second chapter. In the third chapter, I examine how a small ques- tion of grammatical propriety-gender-is made to echo much larger hierarchical social structures. Using gender as a way of explaining the relationship between the body and the soul thus provides the DeQ with a solid but problematic metaphorical support structure. Finally, I distin- guish a number of different types of writing that lend their characteris- tics to the DeQ, what Hildebert's use of these other genres signifies, and how a reader's knowledge of other texts would shape his expecta- tions of and reaction to the DeQ, taking into consideration the manuscript evidence for its reception. I append my own translation of the Latin text based on the recent edition by Peter Orth (Hildeberts Prosimetrum De Querimonia und die Gedichte eines Anonymus, Vienna: Osterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2000). Degree in Medieval Latin 2002 KEVIN FRANCIS DALY-Citizens, Soldiers, and Citizen-Soldiers in Attic Garrisons in the Fourth to the Second Centuries BCE T HIS dissertation examines the epigraphic documents of military bodies stationed at the garrisons of Attica from the fourth to the second centuries BCE. Five chapters make up the work. Chapter 1 sets the geographical and chronological limits of the work and briefly reviews previous scholarly research on the garrisons and the garrison soldiers. Of primary interest to past researchers has been the precise juridical status of the men stationed at Attic forts. Many have found that through constant contact the civic distinction between Athenian soldiers and foreigners slowly broke down. In part, this dissertation attempts to test that notion. Chapter 2 consists of a corpus of the texts, a critical apparatus, and a translation for each garrison document. Where autopsy was possible, an epigraphic commentary has also been included. To some degree this chapter may stand alone as a corpus of garrison texts. Chapter 3 gathers the terms by which the soldiers have named themselves in the documents and gives a historical analysis of those terms. Chapter 4 reconstructs what life at the forts would have been like. Particular topics discussed are defensive duties, pay, housing, leisure activities, and the practice of political assembly. The final chap- ter, Chapter 5, reassesses previous scholarship. In the end, the lines of distinction between Athenian and non-Athenian prove to have been</page><page sequence="3">Summaries of Dissertations 491 quite strong, despite constant interaction. While there is no doubt that interdependence between groups was the norm, the Athenians had no difficulty telling who was local citizen, who was soldier, and who was citizen-soldier. Degree in Classical Philology 2001 CASEY Du--) Homeric Variations on a Lament by Briseis T HIS dissertation examines the figure of Briseis in the Iliad as an example of the traditional artistry enabled by a highly complex and self-contained oral poetic system. Through a close reading of Homeric passages pertaining to Briseis I show how the Iliad refers to expanded and alternative traditions about Briseis even while asserting its own version of her story. Reconstructing the force of Briseis' char- acter from a diachronic perspective, I argue that in some Aeolic epic traditions Briseis once had a story that was well-known, involving the sack of her city and capture by Achilles. Briseis' lament for Patroclus in Iliad 19 hints at the role she once had in the larger epic tradition. It seems likely that there were at least two variations on her story, because of the two-fold pattern she fulfills in ancient references. In one variation she is a wife whose husband is killed by Achilles in the sack of his city; in another she is an unmarried girl, the daughter of a king, whose father is killed when Achilles captures her town. Our Iliad alludes to multiple variations on these two basic themes. Briseis' lament is a compressed retelling of her life story that also maintains a meaningful relationship with the Iliad as a whole. A close analysis of Briseis' song reveals a complex web of meaning through substitution as the poetry connects Briseis with the other women of the Iliad, including Chryseis, Helen, and Andromache. I analyze both these timeless substitutions as well as the personal associations in the figure of Briseis, in order to demon- strate her powerful role in the structure and poetics of the Iliad. I rely on a variety of sources, including internal evidence of the Iliad, the scholia to the Iliad, the extant fragments of the Epic Cycle and the sum- maries of Proclus, later fictional accounts of the Trojan War, and repre- sentations on vases. Throughout, I use the figure of Briseis as an exam- ple of the empirical reality of the system demonstrated by Milman</page><page sequence="4">492 Summaries of Dissertations Parry and Albert Lord in their studies of Homer as traditional oral poetry. Degree in Classical Philology 2001 MARY EBBOTT-Imagining Illegitimacy in Archaic and Classical Greek Poetry T HIS study is an investigation of metaphors of illegitimacy in archaic and classical Greek poetry and in particular of the way in which the nothos ("illegitimate child") is imagined in detailed narra- tives. These narratives present a complex portrayal of illegitimacy, and decoding the conceptualization of the nothos reveals cultural assump- tions behind these representations and allows for a better understanding of the texts within which they operate. My approach considers metaphor as an interaction between terms. As an interaction, metaphor creates meaning in its context by seeing one thing in terms of another. I argue that metaphors (especially their visual aspects) that are used in poetic narratives about nothoi can help us decipher some of the many associations of this complex status-that is, how the metaphors con- nected with nothoi shape the very concept of illegitimacy. Metaphors of illegitimacy in this study include: a shadowy quality, exemplified by the term skotios; non-citizen statuses such as foreigners, slaves, archers, women, and young children; images of sterility, such as mules; and counterfeit coins. These metaphors appear in narratives in the works of Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Theognis, Herodotus, Strabo, Apol- lodoros, and Pindar. This imagery in context suggests several underly- ing principles. One such principle is an ideology of marriage as a cul- tural control of the "natural" desires of women. Anxiety over determin- ing paternity appears in the association of nothoi and deception. The mother's possible deception is ascribed to the child, who is suspect in all things once he is suspect in birth. Nothoi are represented as particu- larly identified with their mothers. This feminization imparts to them the same lack of public visibility and agency as that of women. Nothoi can thus be imagined to remain perpetually underage and analogous to statuses that are secondary to the citizen. The portrayal of nothoi as boys who never grow up reveals the conflation of citizen status and the definition of manhood. Although the exclusion of nothoi from the polis in these narratives prompts questions concerning the possible waste of</page><page sequence="5">Summaries of Dissertations 493 their potential value, the texts may also reinforce the cultural impera- tives of determining and controlling legitimacy. Degree in Classical Philology 2001 JUDSON SPENCER HERRMAN--After the Fall: The Funeral Orations of Demosthenes and Hypereides THROUGHOUT the 5th and 4th centuries BC, at the close of each campaign season the Athenian state honored its dead in a public burial ceremony, choosing a prominent orator to give the keynote address. Two of those orations, those of the orators Demos- thenes and Hypereides, are the subject of After the fall: the funeral ora- tions of Demosthenes and Hypereides, a thesis written by Judson Spencer Herrman under the direction of Albert Henrichs. The work is written in the format of a critical edition with translation and commen- tary. The textual edition is based on a fresh collation of the papyrus that provides the sole basis for Hypereides' speech and four of the most important Byzantine manuscripts of Demosthenes. This is the first edi- tion of Demosthenes' speech to report accurately the readings of the manuscripts with respect to prose rhythm. The Hypereides edition is the first to conform to editorial conventions which are now standard for papyrological texts, and the critical apparatus contains more informa- tion about the suggestions of earlier scholars than can be found in exist- ing editions. The commentary focuses on literary and historical issues. It considers the position these two orations hold within the epitaphic genre and also demonstrates their significance as sources of historical information for the last days of classical Athens. In contrast to the other surviving funeral orations, the speeches of Demosthenes and Hyperei- des were delivered much in the form which survives. The authenticity of these two funeral orations makes their study crucial for an under- standing of the epitaphic genre. Unlike the other orations, these two speeches are detailed sources for the history of their period. They were delivered at two of the most important junctures in 4th century Athe- nian history: the tragic defeat by Philip at Chaeronea in 338 and the Lamian War, which finally brought Athens and the rest of Greece under Macedonian control in 322.

Allegorical interpretation has its origins in the conventions of traditional mythical poetry and the inductive character of Greek reli- gious thought. Hindering perception of this is the assumption that alle- gory is the result of a crisis in Greek theology occasioned by the rise of a new scientific rationality. However, all of the elements of allegorical interpretation are already present in archaic poetry, and above all a con- sciousness that anthropomorphic language about the gods is symbolic, and identification of gods with natural and psychological forces. The pre-Platonic history of allegory culminates in the Derveni Papyrus, in which it is clear that allegory is a part of a single enterprise with theol- ogy, religion, and cosmology. The dissertation argues that Plato is not simply opposed to allegorical interpretation of myth, but that his reac- tion to it is essentially ambivalent. On the one hand, his epistemology is fundamentally anti-authoritarian, insofar as nothing that one receives from an authority is considered ipso facto authoritative, so that the intellectual and moral authority of the mythical tradition carries little weight with him, and using allegory as a technique to understand myth would be in vain. On the other hand, he recognizes and uses myth's power to communicate what cannot be known, and also to illustrate what one comes to know through the conversion of one's soul to the philosophical ascent. Lucretius shares Plato's ambivalence. There is a deep underlying sympathy between the two philosophers, through a diametric and explicit opposition of the latter's materialist Epicure- anism to the former's idealism, in their criticism of the mythical-reli- gious tradition's claims to authority. We shall see that Lucretius tries to do Plato one better, to turn Plato against Plato, by becoming the very poet whom Plato's Socrates would be compelled by his argument to allow into his mythical city, and allegory is integral to this project.
