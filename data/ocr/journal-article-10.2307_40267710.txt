Unnatural Voices is the first sustained study of outrageous, impossible, experimental and eccentric narrative point-of-view in modern and contemporary fiction. With chapters on second person ("you") narration, narration in the first person plural ("we"), multiperson narration, unreliable or absent narrators, narration in drama, narrators that refuse the distinction between historical and implied author, and narratives that insist on the perme- able quality of this distinction, the book effectively identifies and describes a range of dis- tinctive and unusual narrative strategies from the nouveau roman to magical realism. Richardson's scope is impressively global, and the book is very effective in drawing to- gether a variety of works that evince interesting and unusual narrating agents and strate- gies, essentially defining a tradition of extreme narration that traverses late modernism, the avant garde, and postmodernism while concurrently identifying some intriguing precursors to this tradition in nineteenth and early twentieth-century fiction. Foregrounding this tra- dition serves an additional purpose: Richardson's argument for the revision of traditional narrative theory beyond the foundational oppositions of first and third person or homo- and heterodiegesis. Because this book pursues two goals at once - it delineates a tradition of extreme narration and engages with the field of narrative theory - its best moments occur when its two objectives work together. Within the realm of second-person narration, for example, Richardson identifies three distinct modes: the standard mode, in which "you" designates both narrator and protagonist ("You are at a nightclub talking to a girl with a shaved head"); the hypothetical mode which, like a user's manual, takes the form of a series of imperatives ("Begin by meeting him in a class, in a bar, at a rummage sale"); and the auto- telic mode, in which the "you" implicates the reader as well as the narratee ("You are about to begin reading Italo Calvino's new novel, If on a winter's night a traveler") (qtd. in Richardson 23, 29, 31). Identifying these categories and distinguishing between them en- ables Richardson to describe a range of narrative effects as self oscillates toward and away from other and the reader is interpellated into the diegesis - a move that will lead him, in the book's penultimate.chapter, to argue for the inclusion of historical authors and actual readers as referential entities, essentially expanding the time-honored model of the narrative transaction that distinguishes historical author and reader from those implied by the literary text. More often, though, the book attests to the structuralist origins of classical narratology, as taxonomies are defined and refined at the expense of demonstrating how these categories and types of narrative facilitate new readings of canonical texts or illuminate the impor- tance of less familiar ones. There are, of course, some exceptions: the discussion of first- person plural narration in Conrad's The Nigger of the "Narcissus" (1897) and of second- person narration in Mclnerney's Bright Lights, Big City (1984) offer some fine insights into the construction and dissolution of community and intersecting levels of alienation in these texts. But precisely because the range of this book is so wide, one would like to see novels like Sunetra Gupta's The Glassblower's Breath (1993), Nuruddin Farah's Maps (1986), or Carlos Fuentes's Aura (1962) treated to similarly illuminating analyses. When Richardson</page><page sequence="2">NAOMI MANDEL | UNUSUAL TECHNIQUES 321 does advance thematic links between narrative voice and text, his conclusions are rela- tively unoriginal: "we" narration "valorize[s] collective identity" (50), for example, whereas "multiperson narration" can "reproduce . . . the jagged fissures within a single subjectivity" (67). Given that Richardson rightly rejects the idea that "there is a simple pro- gressive or conservative 'essence' to any particular [narrative] technique" (73), one would expect his approach to provide something other than the somewhat unimaginative revela- tion that narrative techniques mimetically reflect the social and psychic realities they thematically convey. And herein lies one of this volume's main weaknesses: the prominence it accords mimetic conventions, which seem to be postulated merely for the purpose of being demolished. As a result, and despite Richardson's investment in "the neglected twentieth-century tradition of non- and anti-mimetic fiction" (14), this book seems to be a case-study in what James Phelan has called "the interpretive habit to preserve the mimetic" (28). The investment in mimesis takes several forms, one of which is the aforementioned tendency to read narrative tech- niques mimetically. More problematic is its extension into Richardson's characterization of the field, which he describes as "typically based on the mimesis of actual speech situa- tions" (5) - a somewhat skewed version, advanced, it seemsy to lend credence to his call to abandon "narratological models that are solely based on mimetic works" (138). The origin of this version is (Patrick O'Neill's paraphrase of) Wolfgang Kayser's 1954 definition of the narrator as "someone" who "tells a story," and his assertion that "the death of the narrator is the death of the novel" (qtd. in O'Neill 76; Richardson 1, 86). Richardson, like O'Neill, evokes Kayser's statement solely to discount it; unlike O'Neill, Richardson treats this statement as typical of "the implicit mimetic presuppositions of conventional notions of the narrator" (86) against which his argument is leveled - hardly an accurate description of this diverse and capacious area of study, but one that serves the rhetorical purpose of justifying the book's argument that "one can no longer presume the existence of a real hu- man or a human-like narrator standing above and beyond the discourse" (134). As a result, and despite Richardson's suggestion that the relation of his argument to mimetic theories is supplemental rather than antithetical (138), the prevailing model of narrative theory in this book remains Kayser's discredited one: rigidly predicated on realism ("centered on story- telling situations in real life" [3]) and myopically anthropomorphic: "all current theories of the narrator" presuppose "the principle of an autonomous, individual consciousness" (95). This conceptual rigidity extends to an investment in firm distinctions and dichotomies that may account for some of the book's puzzling omissions. The genre of autofiction (a nar- rative technique that deliberately combines the fictional and the autobiographical) is not mentioned; prominent contemporary authors like Michel Houllebecq, Frédéric Beigbeder, Hervé Guibert, and Bret Easton Ellis are also absent, though their work would seem to be directly relevant to Richardson's argument for permeable boundaries between homo- and heterodiegesis, and their popularity (or notoriety) would seem to confirm his suggestion that much can be gained by not insisting on the distinction between historical and implied author. Granted, Richardson is interested in narrative strategies that are "only possible in ... a work of fiction" (102) or "impossible outside of fiction" (105). But this fic- tion/ nonfiction dichotomy sits oddly with the book's conclusion, which urges narrative theory to reject "firm distinctions, binary oppositions, fixed hierarchies, or impermeable categories" (139); the general methodology also sits oddly with this conclusion, as "natural narrative" (19, 28, 37, 139) is opposed to the "unnatural voices" in the book. In general,</page><page sequence="3">322 NOVEL I SUMMER 2007 fiction, the human, and the normal, like the mimetic; are firmly distinguished from those nar- rative techniques that subvert, diverge from, or otherwise trouble them - an implicit reification of the "dyadic" quality of "traditional . . . theories of narration point of view" (18) that the book argues against. The book also left me wishing for a more explicit account of its relation to the corpus it examines. It is not dear why a chapter is devoted to drama (106-13) but film and music are treated so cursorily (118-19). A fleeting discussion of forgery and ghostwriting (116-17) left me wondering about other genres like literary nonfiction, literary journalism, and postmodern texts like D.M. Thomas's The White Hotel (1981) that challenge the distinction between fiction and history. I also wanted more explicit engagement with the term "ex- treme," which seemed to promise a contribution to the emerging tradition of extreme contem- porary fiction (which has attracted the attention of scholars like Bruno Blanckeman and Mario Perniola), but which is used adjectivally throughout this study. Of course, a study that leaves its reader wanting more confirms the importance of its subject. But the success of this study is mitigated by some mystifying absences and omissions. Why does a discussion of the interlocutor - narration in the form of answers to questions posed by "a disembodied . . . voice" (79) - focus on the "Ithaca" episode of Ulysses but omit an important play on this form in David Foster Wallace's Brief Interviews with Hideous Men (1999)? The appended bibliography of "We" narratives (141-42) is useful, but why does it omit Elfride Jelinek's Lust (1989), Jim Crace's The Gift of Stones (1988) and T.C. Boyle's "Greasy Lake" (1985)? But the most mystifying absence from this study is any reference to James Olney's magis- terial Memory &amp; Narrative: The Weave of Life Writing (1998). The similarity between the two books is striking, particularly their treatment of pronominal perspective as an oppor- tunity to explore how narrative engages and transforms the relation of self to itself and its world. Olney's attention to "pronouns, their use and abuse, their referential capacity and incapacity" (229) is closely echoed by Richardson's focus on "the nature and function of the narrating pronoun" (101). Both authors are reflecting, in these passages, on Samuel Beckett, and Beckett is central - thematically and structurally - for each. Olney stages a three-way conversation between Beckett, Augustine and Rousseau; for Richardson, Beckett functions as a unifying presence, a paradigm of the narrative strategies explored, and each chapter refers to at least one Beckett text. Though Olney's context is not, of course, limited to the twentieth century, many of the twentieth-century authors he does discuss (Gertrude Stein, Maxine Hong Kingston, Richard Wright, Christa Wolf, Mary McCarthy, Nathalie Sarraute, and Virginia Woolf) also appear in Richardson's study. But the absence of Memory and Narrative from Unnatural Voices goes beyond the coincidence of authors dis- cussed. Precisely because the disintegration of grammatical and psychic subjectivity is approached, by Olney, with a philosophical inflection, Memory and Narrative models an engagement with this material that avoids Richardson's relatively sterile insistence that a single, realistic, self-consistent narrating consciousness be abandoned, and offers an ac- count of multiplicity that need not be predicated on an assumed opposition to realism, co- herence, or the natural. Some attention to this important precursor might have enabled a richer and more nuanced encounter with the phenomenon of extreme narration, and helped Unnatural Voices articulate a more productive engagement with an important and intriguing body of work.
