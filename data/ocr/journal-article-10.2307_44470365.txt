ABSTRACT During the early period of space-suit glove development, heavy reliance was placed on military high-altitude-aircraft full-pressure- suit technology. This status was typical of Project Mercury and early in the Gemini Program. Longer space flights and the advent of extravehicular (EV) operations required drastic improvements in the areas of comfort and mobility, and the incorporation of an EV-hazards protective coverlayer. The current advanced glove designs represent a series of evolutionary engineering efforts aimed at systematically improving higher operating pressure EV glove performance capabilities. The key glove performance issue becomes one of finding the proper balance between the basic protective requirements (i.e., EV environmental hazards) and the performance requirements of the functional glove assembly. Glove design complexity increases with the differential pressure between the glove and the vacuum of space and with the EV activity mobility task requirements. Current space-suit glove design activities associated with the development of candidate higher operating pressure (57.2 kN/m2 (8.3 psi)) glove assemblies are described. THE HUMAN HAND can be regarded as one of the major determining factors of human evolution. Coupled with the human brain and binocular vision, the hand enabled man to make and use tools and to explore, manipulate, and change his physical environment. Basic nude hand functional operations include grasping (prehen- sion), finger/thumb opposition, wrist articula- tion, and tactile feedback. The hand is both a powerful and a delicate mechanism as well as a sensory system through which information is received and transmitted (Figure 1). The challenge presented to glove designers is to preserve and maintain the unique func- tional aspects of the hand while at the same time providing adequate physical protection capabilities. Extravehicular activity (EVA) gloves are the hand protection worn by astro- nauts as part of their space suits when working outside the spacecraft. The EVA gloves must provide hand protection to maintain space-suit oxygen pressure, to enable the astronaut to perform useful hand functions, and to protect against extravehicular (EV) environmental hazards. These requirements constitute capabilities for pressure retention, for load- bearing capacity (man- induced loads and pressure loads), and for thermal, meteoroid/ debris, chemical propellant, abrasion, and puncture protection. Space-suit glove assembly development, starting with Project Mercury, has progressed to the current status as a result of the changing goals and design philosophies of each unique manned spacecraft mission (Figure 2). During the early period of space-suit glove development, heavy reliance was placed on military high-altitude-aircraft full-pressure- suit technology. This status was typical of Project Mercury and early in the Gemini Program.

Longer space flights and the advent of EVA operations required drastic improvements in the areas of comfort and mobility, and the incorporation of an EV-hazards protective coverlayer. Early EVA gloves remained clumsy, fatiguing, and uncomfortable and were the single most limiting factor in manned EVA performance (Figure 3). The current advanced glove designs being developed for the Space Station Program represent a series of evolutionary engineering efforts aimed at systematically improving higher operating pressure (57.2 kN/m2 (8.3 psi)) EVA glove performance capabilities. The key glove performance issue becomes one of finding the proper balance between the basic protective requirements (EV environmental hazards) and the performance requirements of the functional glove assembly. Gloved-hand productivity for EVA requires a high degree of mobility, comfort, and tactility as well as safety assurance. Glove design complexity increases with the differential pressure between the glove and the vacuum of space and with the EV mobility task requirements. BACKGROUND In the pursuit of space exploration and space commercialization, the most important mission priority is often to put hands at work in the space environment to accomplish critical tasks. Space Station activities in the 1990fs will require extensive EVA's, as many as 1000 to 2000 man-hours per year. In terms of enabling the hand to perform as a useful "end-effector" in the alien space environment, development of a functional glove must provide the following specific mobility performance capabilities: • Grasping (prehension) - Metacarpal flexion/extension - Individual finger/thumb flexion/extension • Finger/thumb opposition - Individual finger/thumb motions Fig. 3 - Gemini and Apollo gloves 1.652</page><page sequence="3">881102 • Wrist articulation - Flexion/extension - Abduction/adduction • Tactile feedback - Function of hand sensory nerve endings Through NASA-sponsored and NASA-funded advanced EVA glove development efforts over the years, various glove mobility joint systems have been established to satisfy these performance requirements. Currently, a number of acceptable higher operating pressure (57.2 kN/m2 (8.3 psi)), low- torque-joint design approaches exist for finger application. These include both woven link-net cord systems and gathered/tucked fabric patterned systems. Critical to the operational performance characteristics of the finger joint systems are the location, the size, and the integration of the axial restraint lines, as well as the construction features of both the woven link-net cord system and the gathered/tucked fabric pleats. Next to finger mobility in importance and probably the most critical joint area of a higher operating pressure EVA glove for overall functional performance application is the metacarpal joint. The incorporation of this mobility system feature in an EVA glove should provide finger grasp (prehension) and extension capabilities with relatively low-torque forces required by the gloved hand. This capability in turn will reduce hand fatigue over extensive EVA periods, an important consideration for a Space Station 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) glove supporting numerous planned EVA operations. The design of a metacarpal joint system (coupled with finger flexion/extension) should allow for a range of 30° to 45° of motion (Figure 4). Material expansion at the dorsal (knuckle) portion of the metacarpal joint should be compensated for at the palmar (i.e., compression) side of the hand. The metacarpal design should enable full grasp of an object by the gloved hand when pressurized. Fig. 4 - Metacarpal joint example showing flexure Finally, EVA glove wrist joint design concepts should include consideration of the fact that normal wrist (nude hand) functions such as flexion/extension and abduction/ adduction occur over a fairly short pivot range. The low- torque wrist joint concept that closely approaches this pivot range and that has been integrated into both of the 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) EVA glove configurations to be discussed in this paper is the rolling convo- lute system. In addition to being capable of providing the basic hand mobility performance require- ments, the design, development, and construc- tion of an EVA glove assembly configuration is influenced and complicated by a variety of additional factors including pressure effects, EV-hazards protection layup, hand sizing characteristics, and fabrication and manufac- turing considerations. A brief description of these factors follows. PALM BALLOONING CONSIDERATIONS - When an EVA glove is pressurized, the basic hand (palm) portion of the glove tends to change from an oval to a circular shape. Unless properly controlled, the "ballooning" condition will directly affect the astronauta grasp capa- bility and tactile sensation of EVA handholds and tools. Based on past subjective evaluation experiences, it is doubtful whether a totally rigid palm shell approach to control glove ballooning would be acceptable to a user. The approach used in the current 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) glove assemblies incorporates a combina- tion of hard and soft element features to provide pressurized growth control while enabling adequate grip and tactile sensation. THERMAL MICR0METE0R0ID GARMENT COVERLAYER - The addition of a thermal micrometeoroid garment (TMG) cover layer over the pressure- retention portion of an EVA glove tends to compromise basic glove mobility /torque performance as well as tactility features. Experience has shown that as much as 15 % reduction of the basic pressurized performance capability of the glove can be attributed to the TMG. Since there will always be a systems tradeoff between providing adequate EV-hazards protection and providing adequate mobility performance, reducing the bulk buildup of the TMG and improved tailoring and fitting of the TMG to the basic pressure glove will help to enhance mobility/tactility features. SIZING CONSIDERATIONS - The actual fit of the EVA glove to the individual hand anthro- pometry of the astronaut is extremely critical. For optimum fit, comfort, and performance of required complex mobility functions and based on the wide range of hand anthropometry bivariations, experience dictates that glove design should be based on a custom-fitting rather than a standard-sizing approach. The capability to adjust the length of individual fingers should also be incorporated to enable performing fine adjustments. 1.653</page><page sequence="4">FABRICATION CONSIDERATIONS - In the past, alterations, design shortcuts, or changes to a successful functional mockup glove mobility design feature were sometimes implemented in order to simplify and improve production unit manufacturability of the end- item. These changes usually were made to reduce production time and man-hour costs associated with glove fabrication but often resulted in compromising performance. Since the EVA gloves are critical mobility performing end-effectors, tradeoffs of fabrication cost considerations with mobility capability compromises should be made in favor of performance (i.e., capability vs. cost to build) . MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY - Basic mobility concepts incorporating stable, constant-volume, low-torque mobility joint systems have been designed and built for use in 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) space-suit large- joint systems (i.e., shoulder, elbow, waist, hip, knee, and ankle areas). Few of the successful large design elements employed in the basic space-suit torso mobility systems, however, are readily adaptable to glove design because of the following factors. • Small size of glove mobility elements involved • Complex mobility requirements of the glove • Proximity of the fingers, the thumb, and the metacarpal mobility joint areas Ideally, the need exists for miniaturization of mechanical elements for effective application to glove mobility design features without compromising fit, comfort, or performance. To satisfy the previously mentioned EVA glove mobility performance requirements and design considerations, the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) has sponsored two separate, independent glove development efforts. The following discussion identifies the basic design approaches and the resulting configurations of the latest 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) EVA gloves being developed under JSC contracts by both the David Clark Co., Worcester, Massachusetts, and ILC/Dover, Inc., Frederica, Delaware. DISCUSSION Currently, both the David Clark Co. (D.C.C.) and ILC/Dover are active in the design and manufacture of aerospace crew equipment. The D.C.C, experience dates back to early World War II, when D.C.C, helped to pioneer the design and manufacture of anti-g suits. Postwar activities by D.C.C, included g-suit development and the design and manufacture of both partial-pressure and full-pressure suits including the first Gemini EVA suit. Likewise, ILC/Dover 's experience base extends over the past 20 years of space activities from the Apollo through the Space Shuttle Programs. During that period, ILC/Dover has developed and fabricated a variety of EVA space-suit assem- blies in support of Apollo, Skylab, and Space Shuttle EVA operations. The design approaches used by both D.C.C, and ILC/Dover for the development of 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) EVA gloves is based to a large degree on their respective full-pressure-suit experience backgrounds. D.C.C. GLOVE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES STANDARD PRESSURE GLOVES - To satisfy both comfort and mobility performance requirements in some of the D.C.C. 's early pressure suits, Mr. David Clark conceived of and invented a method for manufacturing a unique material which has come to be known as link-net. Link- net is similar in structure to the common chain link fence material (Figure 5), the difference being that link-net is made from a flexible braided cord rather than a rigid material. Thus, each link-net cord is free to flex and slide through each stitch or interconnection. Link-net is used in lieu of conventional woven fabrics for two basic reasons: (1) its unique capability to conform to body contours when unpressurized or unloaded and thereby to provide a high degree of comfort, and (2) its capability to provide a high degree of mobility, both unpressurized and pressurized, through a shifting or movement of the link-net material . Another useful feature of link-net material is its capability to be collapsed and elongated, particularly along an axial load restraint line. This feature facilitates the making of relatively simple sizing (length) Fig. 5 - Link-net 1.654</page><page sequence="5">881102 adjustments with cylindrical or conical elements (i.e., legs, fingers). Virtually all the D.C.C, standard, high- altitude-aircraft operational (full and partial) pressure gloves employ conventional woven fabrics for the structural/restraint layer in the fingers and hand areas, whereas link-net is used only in the wrist to provide conformai comfort and universal mobility for that joint. Long-term unpressurized-wear comfort has been a primary design goal with pressurized finger mobility somewhat a secon- dary issue. Since most pressure suits used in aircraft are emergency backup systems (to cock- pit pressurization systems) and are thereby normally used in the unpressurized suit mode, their pressurized performance requirements are less demanding than those of a system where pressurization is the primary operational mode (i.e., space-based EVA). The degree of standard full-pressure-glove mobility performance degradation associated with emergency suit pressurization in an aircraft cockpit setting has been considered acceptable and has not warranted the development of more complex and costly glove designs. DEVELOPMENT OF D.C.C. ELEVATED-PRESSURE GLOVE - Based on a review of NASA's 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) glove requirements, D.C.C, designers felt that the desirable characteristics for a higher operating pressure glove were similar in many regards to the unique characteristics offered by link-net construction. Thus, for the first time, link-net was applied not only to the wrist, but also to the fingers and thumb area of full-pressure gloves. This application permitted the introduction of adjustable-length fingers by integrating adjustable axial restraint lines on the sides of each finger, much the same as has been done for many years with link-net legs on full-pressure suits. This single feature (adjustable-length fingers) is considered a significant advancement in glove fit/performance in that a nearly perfect finger length fit is critical to pressurized- glove hand performance. Furthermore, it simplified the need for custom-patterned glove fingers. Additionally, the introduction of link-net material in the finger and thumb areas provided a high degree of pressurized-finger mobility while maintaining good hand comfort. A series of phased 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) glove development activities was pursued over the past few years to investigate various mobility joint element features. Phase I (1981-82) - D.C.C.'s first pair of 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) gloves (Phase I) incor- porated adjustable-length link-net fingers, a conventional flat-patterned, woven-fabric palmar/back-of-hand element with a single palm- restraint bar and a link-net wrist element restrained lengthwise by multiaxis gimbal rings designed to provide a "universal" wrist joint. Although this "soft" glove was very comfortable and had improved mobility (compared to the baseline Shuttle glove), two shortcomings were evident: (1) the lack of a metacarpal joint Fig. 6 - D.C.C. Phase I 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) glove impeded finger mobility and (2) the link-net wrist element was inherently unstable when sized and adjusted for the lowest possible (joint) torque. The link-net fingers/thumb performed very well, as did the wrist gimbal rings. Being mostly all soft and conformai, the glove was judged to be very comfortable (Figure 6). Phase II (1983-84) - D.C.C.'s Phase II follow-on glove effoht concentrated on develop- ing a sliding-cord, soft metacarpal joint and improving the wrist element through the elimi- nation of link-net and the incorporation of a dual-gimbal-ring-restrained toroidal convolute element. In addition, different braided cords (Teflon, Nomex, and Kevlar) were evaluated as alternate candidate link-net materials for the fingers and thumb (Figure 7). During manned evaluations, the results showed some improve- ment in all areas. Performance of the Teflon link-net fingers was superior to that of other materials in terms of torque; however, the improvements in the metacarpal and wrist areas were judged to be only minimal. To achieve the desired improved performance characteristics, it became apparent that significant design innovations would have to be incorporated in the wrist area and the metacarpal joint area. Phase III (1985-86) - D.C.C. 's Phase III glove development activities placed emphasis on the design of finger metacarpal and wrist joint 1.655</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 7 - D.C.C. Phase II 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) glove systems. Prototype configurations of rolling convolute joints evolved from this effort for application to both the metacarpal area and the wrist joint element of the glove. The rolling convolute wrist joint was highly effective in achieving a natural wrist motion and range with corresponding little torque force required for operation. The rolling convolute metacarpal joint also dramatically reduced hand torque required for grasping operations. Although the reduction in required torque resulted in reduced hand fatigue, the tradeoff penalty for the prototype version of the rolling convolute metacarpal hardware components was that the glove palm area became less soft and was perceived as being less comfortable. Two basic glove configurations were designed and fabricated during the Phase III development activities (Figure 8). Phase III-A Configuration - The Phase III- A (rolling convolute) wrist joint employed a gimballed exoskeleton composed of four machined aluminum rings, sized so as to nest, with plain bearing pivots located to provide a total mobility range of approximately 90° for flexion/extension and 45° for adduction/ abduction. The largest ring served as the (sealed) interface with the glove connecting ring/bearing, and was designed to bias the glove 10° in the flexion direction, since this position was thought to be more neutral for a relaxed wrist joint. The smallest ring served as the interface with the fabric (hand) portion of the glove. The soft rolling convolute element of the Phase III-A wrist joint consisted of a 0.13-mm (5 mil) thick urethane film pressure bladder, supported and restrained by a cylindrically woven and shaped Dacron fabric element, which was furnished (through NASA) by Albany International, Dedham, Massachusetts. Because of coating breakdown during mobility endurance cycle testing, the success of attempts to coat various fabric elements with a urethane film and eliminate the need for a separate gas- containing layer was limited. Phase III-A wrist joint mobility (range and torque) performance proved to be very promising. Pivot bearing wear and aluminum ring distortion during overpressure testing at 144.8 kN/m2 (21 psig) were noted as short- comings during testing and evaluation of the Phase III-A gloves. Suited evaluation of the gloves also revealed that the 10° flexion bias caused some skin contact with the hard wrist joint at the back of the hand during joint extension, resulting in some discomfort. The Phase III-A (rolling convolute) meta- carpal joint employed an exoskeleton composed of two stainless steel rings, shaped to fit the human hand in the metacarpal area and sized so as to nest with minimal bulk. Plain bearing pivots were located at each end, adjacent to the index and little fingers. Pivot placement proved to be critical to proper balancing of the metacarpal rings for neutral (unbiased) joint mobility. The soft, fabric hand and finger portions of the glove were integrated directly with the steel metacarpal rings, with the pivot bearings providing the necessary structural link. The soft rolling convolute element of the Phase III-A metacarpal joint consisted of a Fig. 8 - D.C.C. Phase III-A and III-B 57.2- kN/m2 (8.3 psi) gloves 1.656</page><page sequence="7">881102 0.25-mm (10 mil) thick urethane film, which served as a self-restrained gas container. Although it was recognized that such an element would require a (fabric) restraint when used during EVA, a restraint was not incorporated during design development, because of the very small (pressure) loads encountered in the metacarpal rolling convolute. Further, the absence of a restraint fabric in this area greatly facilitated the frequent assembly, disassembly, and modifications required throughout the design development of this most complex mobility joint system. Phase III -A metacarpal joint mobility (range and torque) performance proved to be very good. Suited evaluation of the Phase I I I -A gloves revealed interference in handtool coupling caused by tool standoff associated with the rigid, shaped metacarpal rings in the palm. Further, ring sizing and placement proved to be very critical to comfort as well as performance. The Phase I I I -A fingers were essentially the same as the Phase II test bed glove fingers (Teflon link-net), which performed well. Phase III - B Configuration - The Phase III -B gloves differ from the Phase III -A gloves in three major ways: (1) miniature needle bearings replaced plain bearings in the metacarpal joint to further reduce torque and increase cycle life, (2) the 10° flexion bias designed into the wrist joint was changed to 5° to reduce hardware contact with the back of the hand during wrist extension, and (3) the fingers were fabricated using conventional tucked fabric instead of link-net for comparison purposes. Adjustable axial load restraint cords were employed so as to retain the desirable finger length sizing feature first introduced with the link-net fingers. Another minor change involved reshaping of the (Phase III-B) metacarpal rings, to reduce work tool standoff, by making the rings slightly less concave in the palm area. Thus, some tradeoff of good hand-glove coupling in favor of better tool-glove coupling was determined to be both desirable and acceptable. The suited evaluations of the Phase III-B gloves resulted in three revelations. First, the rolling convolute wrist joint is clearly the design of choice for that joint. Some minor adjustments (including the elimination of any flexion bias) are necessary in order to optimize performance, but these focus mostly on improving reliability and maintainability. Second, the rolling convolute metacarpal joint design clearly offers the lowest torque, but is sizing critical and reduces handtool coupling performance. Both shortcomings are considered manageable and there is still some promise for improvement. However, the placement of two (caging) rigid elements between the hand and any work tool which must be grasped will preclude achieving ideal handtool coupling. Thus, this (Phase III-B) glove evaluation suggested two follow-on courses of action: (1) further refinement of the rolling convolute metacarpal joint and (2) further development of a "soft" metacarpal joint. This dual-design approach would offer options to an EVA crew- member, who could select the glove design which best fit him/her and the EVA tasks to be per- formed. For example, assembling 5- to 10-cm (2 to 4 in.) diameter Space Station structures requires different hand/glove dexterity than that required during retrieval/servicing of a satellite, wherein relatively small switches/ connectors must be manipulated. Third, Phase III-B tucked fabric finger objective testing indicated performance which was generally comparable to the link-net fingers. However, subjective evaluation favored the link-net fingers, which tend to bend in a more conformai manner and, thus, feel more natural. Tucked fabric fingers are made of conventional woven fabric which is gathered or tucked in the desired joint areas and then stitched to retain the gathering. These fabric gatherings are the high-load areas under pressure and, thus, become initial flexure points during any bending action. In addition, during test and evaluation activities, it was determined that pressurized- glove joint mobility force measurement methods, particularly for the fingers, are less than precise and, thus, not 100$ repeatable or reliable as absolute objective data. Objective testing is done by manual bending of the joint being tested through a determined mobility range, via external force application, in conjunction with a force measurement device. This application of (point loaded) external force, although useful for comparative purposes, is considered nonrepresentative of actual user- applied forces. Consequently, pressurized-glove mobility joint "objective" performance data must be evaluated cautiously. Subjective evaluation of pressurized-glove performance, while being worn with a properly fitted space suit, and in performing typical (or specific) EVA tasks in a simulated weightless environment, remains the best method for determining glove performance. Phase IV (1987-88) - Two glove configura- tions are being developed concurrently under the Phase IV effort and are again identified as "A" and "B" configurations. The current D.C.C. Phase IV glove development effort is concen- trating on improving both the metacarpal and wrist convolute joint assemblies principally through adjustments in hardware size, shape, and integration design. In addition, an all "soft" design approach is being investigated through the application of a link-net metacarpal joint system to eliminate bulky hardware in the palm area of the glove and to enhance grasping capability. Efforts are also being directed towards improving gas container (bladder) performance and are being focused on comfort, tear resistance, resistance to hydrolysis, and improved durability. A polycarbonate-based Polyurethane compound formulated by the D.C.C, has shown significant promise. Phase IV-A Configuration - The Phase IV- A glove configuration (Figure 9) is a further 1.657</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 9 - D.C.C. Phase IV-A 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) test bed glove design refinement of the basic Phase III gloves. The Phase IV-A wrist joint has been structurally enhanced to reduce ring deflection through the use of stainless steel in lieu of aluminum for the exoskeletal rolling convolute rings. The wrist flexion bias design used with the previous Phase III gloves was eliminated. Further, the smallest diameter ring has been redesigned to simplify glove disassembly/reassembly at the hand-wrist interface. This redesign feature provides glove modularity and improves maintain- ability. The Phase IV-A metacarpal joint has been reshaped to further reduce tool standoff by making the rings less concave than those of the Phase III -B joint in the palm area. Further, a woven-fabric restraint has been added to support the metacarpal rolling convolute bladder in order to improve its durability/reliability. The Phase IV-A fingers are essentially the same as those for the Phase II test bed and the Phase I I I -A gloves (Teflon link-net), but have slightly reduced diameters. Results of a com- parative force evaluation of identical fingers made from both Teflon and Spectra (polyethylene) braided cords favored Teflon on the basis of having slightly less torque. Phase IV-B Configuration - The Phase IV-B glove configuration includes an all-soft finger metacarpal joint, fabricated with link-net. The remainder of the glove is identical to the Phase IV-A configuration. Theoretically, it is felt that the soft metacarpal joint offers better glove-tool coupling and comfort, albeit with some tradeoff in joint mobility range and torque performance. Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment Coverglove - In addition to the development of the structural and restraint elements of the 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) glove as well as improvements to the gas- retention bladder, the D.C.C. Phase IV glove contains improvements to the TMG coverglove. This has been an ongoing effort throughout the series of glove development phases with the pri- mary objective of reducing excessive TMG bulk. Unfortunately, some TMG bulk is inevitable in order to satisfy the thermal and micro- meteoroid protection requirements. However, some of the bulk has been reduced through the use of different materials and patterning, particularly in the palm and fingertip area. The principal gains to be made here are in grasping and tactile/sensory feedback perform- ance. A variety of palm surface material tex- tures and patterning have been and will continue to be evaluated to determine which will provide optimum performance, not only in space but also in the weightless environment training facility ( WETF ) water tank, where most EVA training takes place. ILC/DOVER GLOVE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES In support of NASA's 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) glove requirements, the design goals of the ILC/Dover higher operating pressure EVA glove configuration emphasized improving glove performance mobility in grasping, finger/thumb opposition, wrist articulation, and tactile feedback. The design features can be divided into five different concept areas: (1) finger mobility, (2) palm control development, (3) thumb metacarpal, (4) wrist joint, and (5) TMG coverglove. Each concept area, together with corresponding design approach and results, is described herein (Figure 10). Fig. 10 - ILC 57 .2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) demonstrator glove configuration (two-view drawing) 1.658</page><page sequence="9">881102 FINGER MOBILITY - The ILC glove finger design is based on a tucked fabric pattern design which custom places and anatomically simulates the crewmember's fingers. The goals in this finger design were to reduce bulk and to custom align finger joints. The difficulties in designing custom patterns are twofold: obtaining accurate dimensions from the intricately contoured and dynamic hand shape, and then applying these dimensions to the creation of two-dimensional patterns. This objective was accomplished by creating various hand casts in different positions including flexed, extended, and a neutral working position. Using these three hand mold configura- tions, differences in surface areas of the fully flexed and fully extended molds determine the minimum amount of excess fabric required to accommodate normal flexion. The molds allowed minimum easement in the finger circumferences while still enabling donning of the glove without difficulty. The different hand molds have also allowed patterning of the fabric elements to achieve the most efficient finger flexion. The molds show each individual's phalange joint inter- section and allows custom placing of the tucked fabric pleats. The resulting design controls minimum easement and excess bladder length to maximize joint flexion and thereby to optimize finger torque, range, and comfort. Placement of axial load restraint lines is critical in space-suit design for minimum torque and maximum range. Results of several finger joint studies have shown that the optimum axial restraint placement is identical to the lateral line of the finger. This result corresponds to an equal amount of fabric on the back and front of the fingers. The current Space Shuttle restraint incorporates a finger adjustment capability for slight finger length adjustments required because of growth and elongation from use. This adjustment capability in the Space Shuttle glove is achieved by a cord encased in a tunnel within the seam allowance. This tunnel causes the seam allowance to be much wider than required for structural integrity and greatly contributes to bulk between the fingers. The advanced 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) restraint also incorporates a finger adjustment capability. A hand-stitched tunnel on the seam allowance is used to reduce the seam allowance and thus the bulk between the fingers. See Figure 11 for a comparison between the Space Shuttle glove fingers and the new, advanced 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) glove fingers. A final design feature of the advanced finger configuration lies in the development of an integral all-fabric fingertip, which is again custom patterned from individual hand molds. The all-fabric fingertip has improved tactility over the existing Space Shuttle glove knit fingercap, and its more anthropomorphic shape reduces fingertip pressure points. Pressure on the fingertips causes severe Fig. 11 - All-fabric patterned fingertip fatigue as well as thumb and finger numbing; numbness is attributed to nerve compression caused by pressure on the fingertips. The improved fingertip shape has improved glove performance by providing good tactility without concentrated tip pressure. Overall, the new 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) fingertip design improves finger conformity at operating pressure by reducing all unnecessary easement needed for donning and by anthropo- morphically placing it in the proper relation- ship with the hand. PALM CONTROL DEVELOPMENT - The performance of all EVA gloves centers around the crew- member's ability to grasp and manipulate tools or objects. A critical factor in accomplishing this objective is the capability of the glove to conform to the palm. Ballooning of the palm area of a pressurized glove not only interferes with tactility and grasp retention, but also increases fatigue by reducing the tactile feed- back needed to regulate the force required to grasp and hold an object. The ILC has incor- porated two independent design features to maintain palm control and optimize glove performance. These two design elements are a palm bar and a segmented palm assembly. The palm bar used in the 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) glove is a stainless steel, heat-treated bar in an adjustable tunnel strap. This bar provides contour to the upper palm surface and 1.659</page><page sequence="10">acts as a breakline for metacarpal flexion. The bar is custom formed to the curvature of the crewmember's hand and is adjustable by means of a strap and buckle arrangement for easy donning. To extend the conformai palm control into the concave portion of the hand, ILC has incorporated a segmented palm assembly. This segmented palm assembly is fabricated from hard titanium epoxy segments with angled sides and contoured top and bottom surfaces which do not flex during motion. The segments are attached to Kevlar fabric and create a specific conform- ing contour to the hand's surface. Because of the angles and curvature of the assembly, pressure from the inside of the glove will not allow the restraint to balloon. However, pressure from the outside of the glove, such as force from grasping an object, can be trans- mitted to the hand and thus can provide tactile feedback (Figure 12). The palm conformity in the 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) glove is provided by the combination of the palm bar and the segmented palm assembly and enables crewmembers to grasp and manipulate tools and objects with reduced hand fatigue, increased comfort, and improved tactil ity. THUMB METACARPAL - The 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) glove thumb metacarpal joint has proven to be a significant design challenge, primarily because of the extreme range of motion in the thumb joint, the location of the center of thumb rotation, and the limited space available for hard mechanical elements. In addition, there is a high risk of inducing fatigue and discomfort in the tissue of the thumb surrounding the metacarpal joint. In order to adequately accommodate the thumb, ILC chose to design and develop a "soft" link-net thumb metacarpal joint. All design efforts were directed at maximizing the thumb- to-finger opposition and comfort and at improving grasp retention.

A low-elongation and high-strength cord (Spectra 1000 polyethylene) is used to fabricate the link-net and a Teflon fabric liner is used to reduce cord frictional torque. The link-net covers only the lower thumb metacarpal surface area. Placement of this metacarpal portion of the thumb is most critical in obtaining optimum thumb perform- ance. The tucked fabric finger design is used in the upper thumb to maximize upper thumb tactility and performance (Figure 13). Overall, the link-net thumb metacarpal has resulted in an omnidirectional thumb joint with relatively low torque. The design allows the thumb to be pressed against the palm of the hand, a simple movement not possible to do in the current Space Shuttle space-suit glove. WRIST JOINT - Through a series of previous development activities, it was determined that an oval rolling convolute wrist design provides low-torque flexion/extension, abduction/ adduction, and rotational movement comparable to the nude hand. The rolling convolute wrist design is based on the constant-volume principle for design of pressure-suit joints. 1.660</page><page sequence="11">The principle is that when one side of a joint compresses, the opposite side expands in an equal amount and thus keeps the volume ideally constant with little expended effort. The operational range of a rolling convolute hard-element wrist design is criti- cally dependent upon the alignment of the crew- member with respect to hardware pivot points. Ideally, all the rolling convolute wrist pivots should be aligned with the crewmember's wrist pivot. This ideal situation is impossible because of the inability to mechanically design all three wrist pivots at one center point. Optimizing glove wrist placement is dependent upon the most functional location for pivot point intersection. It was determined that a deviation from the optimum location as small as 0.32 cm (1/8 in.) can result in crewmember contact interference with the wrist rings. The ILC oval rolling convolute wrist design incorporates two rolling convolute rings for flexion/extension in order to increase range without impacting comfort. Each of the flexion/extension rings moves only half the distance that one ring would move, and will not intersect the crewmember's arm or wrist as a single wrist ring would. Because of the much smaller range of motion that is needed for this mode of operation (Figure 14), the wrist incor- porates only one abduction/adduction ring. Overall, the rolling convolute wrist provides a low-torque, comfortable wrist design which provides natural motions in all directions. THERMAL MICROMETEOROID GARMENT COVERGLOVE - The ILC approach to the TMG was to design the mobility joint features and attachment method so as to prevent any restriction in glove performance capability and to maximize grasp retention. Emphasis was placed on a conformai design with minimum bulk. The advanced TMG glove is a varying multi- layer garment to optimize hand mobility, abra- -BLADDER | ^INSULATION DIPPED FINGERCAP SHUTTLE FINGERCAP SHUTTLE TMG 8.3 PSI DEMONSTRATOR GLOVE TMG Fig. 15 - Thermal micrometeoroid garment coverglove sion resistance, and thermal protection. The fingertip, the finger back, the finger front/ palm, and the gauntlet all have different functions which justify their different construction. In the finger area, emphasis was on reduc- ing the bulk between the fingers and providing tactility in the fingertip area. The fingertip design uses a new dipped room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone procedure to elimi- nate the thickness of seam and cap interfaces while enhancing tactility and providing thermal protection. The back of the finger uses Teflon fabric for abrasion protection and aluminized Mylar film for thermal protection. The gauntlet also uses aluminized Mylar film as thermal protection and Teflon fabric for abrasion resistance and durability. Tests were performed to minimize the abrasion-resistant silicone coating (RTV 157) in the palm area. Overall, the TMG coverglove design is basically an upscaled pattern replicate of the restraint layer. The TMG, the glove restraint layer, and the bladder are integrated and evaluated as a total system in order to optimize glove shape and to minimize bulk. Reduced TMG bulk, along with improved integration techniques, provides enhanced glove performance through improved mobility, grasp retention, and tactility (Figure 15). FLEXION/EXTENSION RINGS CONVOLUTE PARTIAL SECTION ADDUCTION/ABDUCTION RING SIDE VIEW 30° FLEXION SHOWN Fig. 14 - Oval rolling convolute wrist</page><page sequence="12">SUMMARY The conducting at JSC of a comprehensive series of both unmanned and manned test and evaluation activities is planned upon receipt of the latest 57.2-kN/m2 (8.3 psi) EVA glove engineering prototype models. Unmanned torque and mobility range measurements will be taken for the finger, the metacarpal, and the wrist joint areas of the respective glove configura- tions. Manned testing and evaluation activi- ties will also be conducted using a laboratory glove box facility prior to the performance of space-suit exercises in the WETF simulating actual EVA structural assembly tasks. Recent evaluations of prototype models of both the D.C.C, and the ILC/Dover glove config- urations have shown significant and continued progressive improvement over the baseline Space Shuttle EVA glove. Design iterations are in progress to evolve a highly acceptable metacar- pal joint element. Although each new design iteration has produced at least a modest performance improvement, it is questionable whether a "standard glove design" will best fit all crewmembers and best perform all EVA tasks. Experience with crewmembers indicates that normal variations in individual anthropometry, strength, conditioning, pain and fatigue threshold, motivation, and physical approaches to an EVA work situation may dictate that more than one glove configuration would be func- tionally acceptable. Custom fitting of gloves to the crewmember's hand has also been shown to significantly improve performance capabilities. It is anticipated that several glove design features will evolve from the current development efforts which will offer additional technology "mix and match" options. These options should enable the design of an advanced EVA glove best suited to the individual during any particular EVA. Final EVA glove configu- ration performance capabilities will always be judged and based on user acceptance. The glove development activities identi- fied in this paper are believed to offer the most promise not only for ensuring that EVA crewmembers have the best possible performing gloves for use in the Space Station Program, but for serving as a technology base for future lunar and martian surface activities. 1.662</page></plain_text>
