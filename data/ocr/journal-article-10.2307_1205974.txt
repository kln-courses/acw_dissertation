<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEUTSCH, NATHANIEL. The Gnostic Imagination: Gnosticism, Mandaeism, and Merka- bah Mysticism. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1995. x+163 pp. $58.25 (cloth). This careful and lucid study examines the nature of early Jewish esotericism through a reevaluation of its relation to Gnostic sources. In five concise chapters, Deutsch not only familiarizes the reader with the debate about the historical rela- tion between these traditions but also connects such debate to broader discussions of mysticism and myth, scriptural exegesis, and visionary experience. Through a judicious use of quotation Deutsch allows these debates to unfold; and rather than hobble together some artificial consensus, he lets the differences remain, stimulating both historical and phenomenological reassessments. Chapter 1, "The Problem," starts by reviewing the work of Gershom Scholem; this is an economical and logical choice with which to begin the inquiry, given that Scholem is the preeminent figure in the twentieth-century study of Jewish mysticism and that virtually all subsequent work draws on his ideas. While reser- vations about Scholem's theses have already been voiced, most notably by Moshe Idel, Scholem's influence has continued to dominate the discourse. Given that Scholem revised his ideas, occasionally even reversing himself, the Sixth Interna- tional Conference on the History of Jewish Mysticism took as its task a rethinking of Scholem's positions. This resulted in an exemplary collection of essays, Gershom Scholems "Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism," 50 Years After (Tiibingen, 1993); Deutsch's monograph is a fine complement to both book and task. Deutsch sets out to demonstrate that "Scholem actually articulated a variety of complimentary, competing, and, even, contradictory views on Gnosticism and Merkabah mysti- cism" (p. 2). Moreover, Deutsch addresses what is often overlooked in discussions of Scholem's work, namely that "Scholem seemed to waver between historical and phenomenological explanations for parallels between Gnosticism and the Kabbalah" (p. 11). In the remainder of the book Deutsch proceeds to sort out both Scholem's positions and readings in subsequent scholarship. Chapter 2, "Defining Gnosticism and Merkabah Mysticism," takes up specific points in the comparison ofJewish and Gnostic sources, questioning the adequacy 307</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion of received criteria. In so doing, Deutsch shows that the scholarly discourse is composed of a range of unspoken assumptions, in which scholars have not fully defined their terms; instead, they have relied on accepted usages or tacitly in- voked a consensus which has since been challenged. This retrospective enables us to see how an academic discourse shifts, sweeping away some pieces of evi- dence while leaving monolithic constructs such as "normative Judaism" or "Gnos- ticism" itself, littorally stranded. Chapter 3, "Scripture and Exegesis," deals with the midrashic element in these respective traditions; instructive is Deutsch's syn- opsis of recent critiques of Scholem's dichotimization of mystical experience and interpretation (p. 63-67). Chapter 4, "Cosmology and Ascent," continues to inter- rogate purported parallels by looking at select motif-complexes, such as the en- thronement or the angelification that transforms the mystic during his heavenly ascent. Chapter 5, "Theology," opens with the bugbear of dualism and its theoretical incompatibility with monotheism. Demiurgic traditions usher into the debate Shiur Qomah sources, which claim to reveal the gigantic measurements of a di- vine anthropos. Here, Deutsch is particularly incisive, correcting those interpre- tations that apologetically press the Shiur Qomah into the service of some (unat- tested) apophatic theology. Instead, Deutsch rightly depicts these Shiur Qomah traditions as a bold anthropomorphism stemming from mythological conceptions of the imago dei (pp. 144-45). Focusing first on traditions concerning the hy- postatic face (pp. 99-111) and then considering traditions of the hypostatic phal- lus (pp. 111-27), Deutsch builds off the work of David Halperin and Elliot Wolf- son in discussing the sexual symbolism of Merkabah texts. The deft treatment these motifs receive here helps further to establish the connections extending from esotericism to eroticism. Once Deutsch turns his attention to these configu- rations of anthropomorphic imagery, he begins to engage the primary materials more directly and to venture some original readings of his own. In part, his con- tribution lies in bringing Mandaean sources to bear on these motifs in an attempt to correlate terms. Drawing mostly on the work of Edith Drower, and acknowl- edging the important researches of Kurt Rudolph and Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley, Deutsch uses the Mandaean materials to explicate the sexual content of this imag- ery. In his opinion, "Mandaean sources sometimes preserve originally Jewish tra- ditions in their most extreme form" (p. 153). Given the benign neglect of Man- daeism in recent scholarship, this aspect of Deutsch's work is all the more commendable. A meticulous bibliography undergirds this well-formulated and often insightful study. Deutsch has thoroughly yet succinctly examined a topic well worth revis- iting. Future discussions will perforce make ample use of this book. GREGORY SPINNER, Tulane University.</page></plain_text>
