<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LANGUAGE OF HORSE RACING G. CLARK CUMMINGS New York City HORSE RACING is one of the oldest and most popular American sports; it is also an industry and a gambling medium of considerable magnitude. Despite this, the language of horse racing has been almost ignored by students of speech. Significantly, the only treatment of horse racing in American Speech appears to be Thornton, 'O Tempora, O Nomina!"' which briefly discusses horses' names. A further indication of the philological neglect of horse racing is the recent appearance of front-runner, and front running in 'Among the New Words,' in American Speech.2 Actually, both terms (with the antonyms stretch- runner and stretch running) have been a part of horse-racing speech for some 3 years. Mencken has largely neglected the language of horse racing. The American Language (4th ed.; 1936) and Supplement One (1945) contain almost nothing. Supplement Two (1948) treats horse racing in only two particulars: at pages 593-94 horses' names are considered, and at pages 768-70 there is a collection of some of the slang of 'Racetrack Followers.' There are two glossaries dealing to some extent with horse-racing speech: the Turf Dictionary for Racing Fans4 and Maurer, The Argot of the Racetrack.5 Both however, are largely concerned with race-track slang and with the language of off-track betting, two subjects which, because of space limitations, will be largely untreated herein. The aim of this article is to do no more than suggest the salient aspects of the language of horse racing. It is the hope of the author, who is an amateur in both philology and horse racing, thereby to provoke more intensive analyses by persons having a professional background in one, if not both, of these fields. The term horse race will be used herein in what is probably its common meaning: a contest over a flat area between horses with riders on their backs. Such a definition excludes jumping races, which are either steeplechase or hurdle races, depending on the nature of the obstacles. It also excludes what is generally called a harness race or trotting race, that is, a contest between horses pulling a vehicle and driver. (In point of fact, a 'trotting race' may, technically, 1.

C., 1951.</page><page sequence="2">18 AMERICAN SPEECH require the horses either to trot [left front and right rear feet moving together] or to pace [front and rear feet of the same side moving together].) Legislators commonly have occasion to distinguish between the various types of racing, and in New York State, by Section 7501 of the Unconsolidated Laws, there is a differentiation between 'trotting, running [and] steeplechase' race meetings. Recently the term fiat race has gained currency as an antonym of harness race.6 Historically, however, this is illogical since fiat race has heretofore been used to distinguish the ordinary horse race (which is run 'on the flat') from the jumping variety. A more logical contrast between a horse race and a harness race is sometimes made by referring to the former as a running race or, oc- casionally, as a saddle race. Finally, the two basic types of races are commonly distinguished by reference to the breed of the horses involved. A horse race is a contest between thoroughbreds, and horse racing is therefore referred to as thoroughbred racing. A harness race, however, is a contest between standard- breds, although such animals are more often called simply trotters. A 'thorough- bred' is thus, biologically speaking, a distinct breed. It is not simply a horse which has been thoroughly bred and the blood lines of which are, therefore, pure. In view of the antiquity of horse racing relative to harness racing, it seems likely that this use of thoroughbred arose because running horses were originally the only English horses which were thoroughly bred. Racing's use of the term thoroughbred contrasts with the prevailing (though not universal) terminology used in respect of other species of animals. A dog, for instance, regardless of its breed, if it is scientifically bred (and is therefore technically a 'purebred') will often be referred to as a thoroughbred. The term blooded also has a specialized meaning among most horsemen and denotes no breed but the thoroughbred. Thus a leading trade publication of thoroughbred racing is The Blood-Horse. Any nonthoroughbred, regardless of the purity of its pedigree, is a cold-blooded horse. Horse-racing language is, in many respects, highly technical. Indicative of this is the fact that the word horse is itself a term of art. The word is, of course, used by the layman without regard to the age or sex of the animal, but among horsemen a horse, technically, is a male over four years of age. For simplicity, Rule 151 of the 1954 Rules of the New York State Racing Commission (here- after referred to as R.) provides that horse is used therein to include 'mare, gelding, colt and filly.' A female over four is a mare; and at four or under a male is a colt and a female is a filly. This contrasts with ordinary speech in which colt refers to any young horse. Racing uses the following self- explanatory terms to describe the successive stages of an animal's life prior to 6. See, for example, the New York Herald Tribune, Dec. Iz, 1953, P. z2/3, 4.</page><page sequence="3">THE LANGUAGE OF HORSE RACING 19 its becoming a colt or filly: foal, weanling, and yearling. Parenthetically, it is to be noted that irrespective of its size, breed, or age, a work horse connected with racing is called a pony; and often the term stable pony or lead pony is used. A race horse reaches maturity at approximately four years of age, and animals under that age are sometimes called younger horses in contrast to older horses. A horse two years of age (the earliest at which it may commence racing) is often called, at least by sports writers, a juvenile. Less commonly, a three-year-old is termed a sophomore. In Berrey and Van den Bark, The American Thesaurus of Slang,7 it is said that an 'aged' horse is one more than six years old, but this term seems to be used mainly in respect of breeds other than the thoroughbred. When a thoroughbred is being referred to in a breeding rather than a racing context the male is usually referred to as a stallion, although mare (occasionally brood mare) continues to be used to describe the female. (A male animal which has been sexually altered, i.e., castrated, is a gelding, and one which is unaltered is referred to as entire.) The stallion and mare which are a horse's parents are, respectively, its sire and dam. Foals are referred to as the progeny or offspring. The progeny of the sire are its get, and the progeny of the mare are its produce. A thoroughbred's ancestry is stated in a distinctive manner. For instance, the 1952 Kentucky Derby winner, Hill Gail, is described, in terms of its breeding, as 'by Bull Lea out of [or 'from'] Jane Gail by Blenheim II.' This means that Hill Gail's sire was Bull Lea, its dam was Jane Gail, and Jane Gail's sire was Blenheim II. Because the sequence is always the same, pedigree is often stated with 'by' and 'out of' replaced by dashes. The importance which is attached to male ancestry is emphasized by the occasional omission of the mare's name. Thus, Hill Gail is sometimes described as 'by Bull Lea out of a Blenheim II mare.' Paradoxically, consanguinity is traced through the dam. For example, two colts having only a common sire are, technically, unrelated, but two colts having only a common dam are half brothers. Two colts having both parents in common are full brothers. R. I69 provides for identification of the breeder of a horse. This is done without reference to ownership at the time of mating: the breeder is the owner of the dam at the time of foaling, that is, the birth of the foal. Consistently, it is provided in R. 152 that a horse is bred at the place of foaling. All such defini- tions have a practical importance. For example, at times a prize is given to the breeder as well as to the owner of the winning horse. Also in certain races 7. New York, 1942.</page><page sequence="4">20 AMERICAN SPEECH eligibility is restricted to horses bred within the state where the race is held. Such horses are often called homebreds, although the term is used more often to refer to horses which an owner has bred in contrast to those which he has acquired from other breeders. The terminology used to describe the various types of races is technical also. Races are commonly classified according to whether or not the owners of the contesting horses are required to pay what is, in effect, an entry fee. If this requirement exists the race may be a sweepstakes because the owner of the winning horse, in addition to receiving the prize offered by the race-track management, literally sweeps the stakes (the entry fees) put up by the other owners. If no prize is offered by the management (and if the race has not been 'advertised') the race is, by R. I58, a private sweepstakes. No race, however, is a sweepstakes if it is an overnight race. The latter, by R. I6o, is a contest in which the entries close 'seventy-two hours (exclusive of Sundays), or less before the time set for the first race of the day on which such race is to be run.'8 Generally a sweepstakes is called simply a stakes (or stake) race. In most other races participation is not conditional on the payment of an entry fee, and the winner receives only the prize given by the management. Any such race is, strictly speaking, a purse (R. I56), but nonstakes contests are usually referred to as ordinary races. A horse of sufficient ability to compete in stakes races is referred to as a stakes (or stake) horse. There appears to be no well- accepted antonym, although not uncommonly the term plater is used, pre- sumably a carry-over from an era when the prize in a nonstakes race was plate. Dowst, in his Win, Place and Show,9 says that plater is an abbreviation of selling plater. The latter term was formerly used to describe horses capable of competing only in selling races, a type of event roughly comparable to the mod- em claiming race. Plater seems to be a mildly derisive term in England as well as in the United States.1o In this country at least, a blacksmith is also some- times called a plater." This is because the shoes worn by a thoroughbred are racing plates. 8. In still other ways racing terminology is as perverse as in its use of the term overnight. For instance, before a race a jockey weighs out and after a race he weighs in. Equally confusing is racing's use of off to mean 'over.' To say that the time in which a race was run was 'one second off the track record' means that the race took one second longer than record time. Often horse-racing speech, while entirely clear, employs an odd turn of phrase of which the following is illustrative: 'The Lawrence Realization . .. was not run for in 1911...'

See, for example, Thayer, August in Saratoga (New York, 1937), p. 28.</page><page sequence="5">THE LANGUAGE OF HORSE RACING 21 Races may be classified according to their requirements respecting the weight which the horses are to carry. There are, oversimplifying somewhat, three principal types: weight for age (or scale weight) races, handicaps, and allowance races. In the first type, weight is assigned on a basis such as the 'Scale of Weights' which appears in R. 267, which takes into consideration not only the age of the horse (in months) but the distance of the race. In a handicap each horse carries an amount of weight which reflects the race- track management's estimate of the horse's ability. In an allowance race a basic weight is established for the race which is subject to automatic increase or decrease for each horse according to its racing record. Apart from certain so- called classics (which are mainly for three-year-olds and are weight for age races) the handicaps attract the best horses. A horse which characteristically runs in such races is frequently called a handicapper, and the term allowance horse is occasionally used to describe a horse which commonly competes in allowance events rather than in handicaps. The term handicapper is also used to mean the race-track employee who determines the weight to be carried by the horses in a handicap. Additionally, handicapper may mean a person who, by an analysis of the horses' comparative merits, attempts to select the winner of a race either for his own betting guidance or for the purpose of selling his selections. Still another criterion according to which races are classified is whether or not they contain a claiming feature. In a claiming race (often called a claimer) each horse may be claimed (i.e., purchased) for the particular sum specified for that race. Such contests naturally attract the poorest horses, and horses which compete only in such races are called claiming horses or claimers. Races may also be classified by reference to their distance. In general, a short race is a sprint, and a long race is a route, and a horse favoring one type of race is therefore either a sprinter or a router. There seems to be no agreement as to the precise limits of the two types of races. For instance, Dowst defines a route as any distance in excess of a mile,'2 whereas Kling in How I Pick Winners treats a mile race as a route.'3 Newborn in If You're Going to Play the Races uses the term middle distance runner to describe a horse which runs best at distances between seven eighths of a mile and a mile and a quarter.14 Although the foregoing, speaking loosely, constitutes the basic language of horse racing, a few additional terms may appropriately be mentioned at this point. Commonly, a race will be for maidens, which means that only horses which have never won a race may enter. Consistently, The Blood-Horse, in each issue's listing of the horses which have won for the first time, says that 12. Op. cit., p. 7I. 13. New York, I948, p. I56. 14. Cleveland, I949, p. 6z.</page><page sequence="6">22 AMERICAN SPEECH they 'broke their maiden.' A similar figure of speech is sometimes used in reference to a jockey's first victory. The term match or match race in common acceptance encompasses any specially arranged two-horse race. R. "59, however, applies the term to such a race only when the track management has added 'no money or other prize.' The term walkover has been adopted as a metaphor in general speech to signify any easy victory. R. 173, however, uses walkover in a different sense, that is, 'when two horses in entirely different interests do not run for a race.' Horses not in 'entirely different interests' are those which have the same owner or, under some circumstances, the same trainer. Such horses constitute an entry, and the owner of an entry may in any race declare to win with only one of the horses. The simple verb to declare, however, has a quite different meaning. It is used in the sense of 'declare out' and means, in effect, to withdraw a horse from a race within the time permitted. A withdrawal after the specified time usually may be made only by scratching, which requires the consent of the manage- ment. Scratch literally describes the result of the withdrawal, since the horse's name must be 'scratched' from the already printed program. Scratch sheet is now synonymous with tip sheet, but its original purpose was, in part, to indicate which of the horses listed in the program had been scratched. The DA men- tions to scratch only in the sense of removing a person's name from a ballot. The OED, however, suggests a racing as well as a political meaning. Next in importance to the rudiments of horse racing speech are a number of comparative terms used to indicate minute differences with precision. The difference in almost any race between the winner and most of the other horses is extraordinarily slight, and consideration must therefore be given in racing horses or in betting on them to all conceivably relevant factors. A paramount concern, for instance, is the state of the track. The following hier- archy of terms is used to describe track condition: fast, good, slow, sloppy, muddy, and heavy. Such differences are, of course, entirely a result of weather, and are so slight that changes may occur during the course of a single racing day. On September 3, 1950, the New York Times gave the following de- scription of Aqueduct for the preceding day: 'Track good for first two races, slow for third, good for fourth, sloppy thereafter.'1" Inevitably, direct attention is paid to meteorological details. For instance, the Morning Telegraph for October 1o, 195o described the preceding day's weather at Bowie in this fashion: 'Weather showery for first four races; raining thereafter."' Horses I5. P. 23. i6. P. 22.</page><page sequence="7">THE LANGUAGE OF HORSE RACING 23 having a special talent for racing on off tracks, that is, tracks which are not fast, are called mudders. Evidence in American Speech indicates that mudder is coming into use in other sports.1 While, in racing, a mudder is usually a horse which performs well only on an off track, the term is occasionally applied to a horse which is able to race well irrespective of the condition of the track. Mudders are subdivided into three categories: superior, good, and fair. As this categorization suggests, horse racing, unlike most sports, is cautious with its superlatives. Not uncommonly a particular year will be said to have produced no great horse. A horse with a seemingly excellent racing background will be described as good; and a horse the record of which, to the uninitiated, would seem good will be described as useful. A year in which a great horse appears is thereafter often mentioned by reference to such horse. Among horsemen Citation's year, for instance, is a working synonym for 1948. In evaluating a horse's performance, particularly in winning a race, the amount of effort expended relative to the horse's potential is important. The following hierarchy, which describes four recognized types of racing finish, approaches the matter from such a standpoint: driving, ridden out, easily, and handily. Comparable terms are used in reference to performance in training, as well as the following additional expressions: all out, eased up, and breezing. Newborn anylyzes certain of the training phrases: 'Driving [is] the horse being under urgency,' . ... 'handily is the horse being permitted largely to suit himself for speed; breezing is the horse being under restraint.'1s 'Breezing,' in the racing sense, is a brisk (although far from 'driving') pace, and presumably is so denominated because such a speed is breeze-making. (The expression to win in a breeze has come to be used in general speech to refer to any easy victory.) Occasionally, a horse which is being given a 'breezing' in training will wear a light blanket, and for that reason be said to be breezed under wraps. From this appears to have come the popular expression under wraps, referring to a reservation or concealment of full strength. A horse's performance may also be related to the amount of pressure (i.e., competition from other horses) involved. The following terms, designating degrees of pressure, are used: severe, stern, snug, steady, continued, extended, and mild. Not all these words, however, have a precise meaning. Linguistic precision of an entirely different character may be found in the description of horse colors. For example, a color which might appear to be simply brown may actually be dark brown, brown, bay, or chestnut. The differ- ence between these shades is often entirely technical. For example, a bay's 17. XXVIII (1953), 49- I8. Op. cit., p. 46.</page><page sequence="8">24 AMERICAN SPEECH dark mane and tail distinguish it from a chestnut. A remarkably precise set of terms is used to describe the relative amount of white marking on a horse's face. The American Racing Manual gives definitions of the following: star, blaze, strip, stripe, and snip."9 Certain of these terms, however, according to The Racing Calendar, are used somewhat differently in 'describing a thorough- bred for Jockey Club registration.'20 White hairs on the legs are often de- scribed by reference to their upper limits: white heels, white coronets, or white pasterns. A white stocking extends to the knee or hock; a white foot is one whose hoof, as well as the hairs near it, is white.21 Horse racing in its present form can be traced at least as far back as seventeenth-century England. The linguistic evidence of this origin is plentiful. In fact, in certain ways the language of American horse racing is still a con- scious English imitation. Thus, in both countries the governing body consists of approximately fifty men called the Jockey Club. (In the United States the clubhouse is simply a superior location for which a higher admission price is charged. Originally, in England at least, it appears to have been the area reserved for members of the Jockey Club.) The jockey clubs of both countries publish a Racing Calendar, and maintain breeding records in a Stud Book. In England the Derby and the Oaks (the first named after the Earl of Derby and the second after his Epsom residence) are the outstanding races for three- year-old colts and fillies, respectively. Similarly, in this country a derby (e.g., the Kentucky Derby) is for three-year-old colts, and an oaks (e.g., the Coaching Club American Oaks) is for three-year-old fillies. In England the three outstanding races for three-year-olds (the Derby, the St. Leger, and the Two Thousand Guineas) constitute the Triple Crown; and in the United States the same term is used to comprehend three of our outstanding races for three-year-olds, the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes. An English antecedent has been sought for our practice of calling a groom a guinea. This is said by Parker in The ABC of Horse Racing to have originated in the custom of past centuries of rewarding the groom of a winning horse with a gold guinea.22 Mankiewicz, in the novel See How They Run, offers a variant of this explanation by suggesting that a groom's pay was a guinea a day.23 The latter, however, is unrealistic since the pay of stable help has always been unimpressive. Actually, the term, in America at least, may conceivably have 19. New York, 1948, P 447- zo. LXI (1954), 406. 21. Blanche, Off to the Races (New York, i947), p. 45. 2 2. New York, 1947, P. 2 o. 23. New York, 1951, p. 37.</page><page sequence="9">THE LANGUAGE OF HORSE RACING 25 had a quite different origin. Most grooms are Negroes, and the DA indicates that since at least 1789, a Negro has sometimes been referred to as a Guinea Negro. No attempt will be made herein at an extensive exploration of the difference between English and American horse-racing language. In general, however, it would seem that (apart, of course, from slang) there is considerable simi- larity despite the physical differences in racing that have developed in the two countries during the last century. One basic departure in American termi- nology is the tendency to refer to the racing area as the track in contrast to the English course. This difference may stem from the fact that in America races are run over a generally elliptical area with a dirt surface, whereas in England they are run on turf (i.e., grass) over an area which may not only be any one of a variety of shapes, but may also be up- and downhill. Track was, however, in use in this country during the period when English racing and ours were, physically, almost identical. The 1796 promotional literature for a pro- posed racing area in Bath, New York, used the terms race course and race track interchangeably.24 Occasionally the term course is used in the United States at the present time. For instance, off-track betting is sometimes referred to as off-course betting, perhaps, unconsciously, because such betting is lawful in England. The word turf has continued to be used in certain contexts in the United States. R. 195 provides for the punishment of 'improper turf practices.' Because English courses have a variety of shapes a straightaway is described by the OED as 'a race course without turn or curve.' In the United States, however, while the term sometimes has this meaning, it more often connotes the portion of the track after the last turn, the so-called home stretch in contrast to the back stretch. The noun tout appears to be one of the few racing terms which have start- lingly different meanings in England and in the United States. Here it is a term of derogation and refers to an individual who sells worthless betting advice. In England, however, a tout's function is to obtain (either for an employer or for sale to the public) data which is not generally available on the competing horses. Both the OED and the DA include tout only as a verb. Proof of the antiquity of racing in the United States is found in the use of the furlong for measurements. For example, three quarters of a mile-a common racing distance-is almost always referred to as six furlongs. In- consistently, however, the poles marking the distance to the finish line are designated by eighths of a mile. The last such marker, for instance, is called the eighth (rather than the furlong) pole. 24. As quoted in the Horseman's Journal, Nov. 1950, pp. 38, 62.</page><page sequence="10">26 AMERICAN SPEECH The height of a horse is measured in hands: a hand is four inches, and measurement is from the ground to the animal's withers. Distances between horses are expressed in lengths, and a horse leading its nearest competitor by more than a length is said to have a daylight lead. For distances less than a length a system has evolved using neck, head, and nose. Newborn asserts that all three terms have precise meanings: 'four noses equal a head, two heads equal a neck, and two necks equal a half length.'25 Laymen, of course, use these terms indiscriminately and will say that a horse won by a neck, head, or nose to describe any race which was extremely close. In this country a bet on a horse to win (rather than to finish second or third) is said to be on the nose. This slang expression is singularly appropriate since R. 207 provides: 'A camera . . . shall be used to make a photograph or photographs of the horses at the finish to assist the Placing Judges in determining their positions as exclusively indicated by their noses.' A race in which there is a tie for first place is referred to as a dead heat. This appears to reflect a much older era when a race often consisted of several heats, with the winner being the first horse to win, say, more than one heat. (A race consisting of only one 'heat' seems to have been called a dash irre- spective of its length.)26 A modern use of heat which is even stranger from a historical standpoint is found in such present-day phrases as a dead heat for second or third. Certain terms in horse-racing language indicate the physical changes which the sport has undergone in the United States in relatively recent years. At the present time horses start a race from a mechanical gate. Yet their order in the gate is referred to as post position and the starting time of a race is referred to as post time. Both phrases reflect a period when races were started simply by having the horses walk together past a post. An interim development resulted in races commencing from a barrier, which generally consisted of a webbing which was pulled up to signal the start. Barrier has continued to be used to describe the modern starting gate. Still another anachronism is the use of winner's circle to describe the enclosure to which the winning horse is taken after a race. Only at Saratoga (America's oldest race track) is there a literal circle for the winner. At other tracks the enclosure is not only differently shaped but is used for a variety of additional purposes. A horse is said to finish out of the money if it is not one of the first three. Whatever may have been the situation originally, the expression is no longer strictly accurate since almost all races now have a fourth prize. Betting, 25. Op. cit., p. 2o. 26. Cf. Creckmore, Racing Calendar, 1867-z869 (New York, I9go), passim.</page><page sequence="11">THE LANGUAGE OF HORSE RACING 27 however, continues to be restricted to the first, second, and third positions, which are referred to as win, place, and show, respectively. The OED points out that to place, technically, means 'to state the place or position [of a horse, etc.] . . . usually done officially of the first three only.' R. 2 11 uses to place in this sense. The origin of show seems obscure: it appears in neither the DAE nor DA. The English do not use the term and, more logically, employ place to cover both second and third. An also ran is a horse which does not finish among the first three, but in general speech the phrase seems to be applied to all contestants but the winner. From the spectator's standpoint one of the most important changes in horse racing in recent decades has been the supplanting of the bookmaker by the pari-mutuel method of betting. Presumably, pari-mutuel means literally 'among ourselves,' and is thus an appropriate description of a betting system in which the bookmaker is eliminated. It has been suggested, however, that the pari is a corruption of Paris where the mutuel system of betting seems to have originated." Support for this etymology is found in the program for the races held in the spring of 1875 at Pimlico, Maryland: 'Pools on the improved Paris mutual plan will be sold ...'28 The pari-mutuels appear to have been responsible for introducing the term breakage into general speech. For simplicity, winning bets are paid only to the nearest nickel or dime. The odd pennies constitute the breakage and are re- tained by the race track unless required to be turned over to the government. In New York State the word is, technically, breaks,"2 but this seems to have little popular acceptance. Breakage should not be confused with change, a term which in horse racing means fractional time. Thus, a race which was run in one minute, twelve and three-fifths seconds may be said to have been run in '1.12 and change.' In a variety of ways language which originated with the bookmaker has continued in use in the present pari-mutuel era. Chalk player is an outstanding example. The term describes a person who bets only on the favorite, that is, the horse with the lowest odds. It appears to have come into use because the odds were quoted by each bookmaker in chalk on his blackboard. The term overlay originally described the situation which existed if a book- maker laid odds which, viewed objectively, were too high. At the present time overlay is used to describe odds meeting this test which appear in the pari- mutuel machine. Most often odds are considered an overlay if they are higher 27. Day and Barber, Racing Almanac (New York, 1953), p. 149. 28. As quoted in Palmer, This Was Racing (New York, 1953), p. 2zo3. 29. Unconsolidated Laws, Section 7568-I.</page><page sequence="12">28 AMERICAN SPEECH than the odds quoted in the so-called morning line. The latter term is a mis- nomer which may also antedate the introduction of pari-mutuel betting. Presently the morning line, which is a statement of probable pari-mutuel odds, is furnished each afternoon at the start of the racing program. The expression may be simply a reflection of the fact that the odds were prepared by the track management in the morning, but it seems more likely to have originated in the bookmaker's practice of quoting odds (and taking bets thereon) in the forenoon as well as at the time of the race. The windows where pari-mutuel bets are made are sometimes called the betting circle. This term obviously, however, was a literal description of the betting area only in the time of the bookmaker. A primary advantage of the pari-mutuels is that operations are largely mechanized. But until recently the daily double (a single bet on the first two races) had to be operated manually. This was done by printing in advance tickets representing the possible combinations, which were then put in racks for sale by track employees. A purchase by a single bettor of every possible combination was described as buying the rack. This term continues in use at the present even though, with complete mechanization, the racks are no longer used. As is true of most sports writing, the prose style employed to describe horse racing ranges from the imaginative to the hackneyed.30 To the outsider, however, its uniqueness may lie in its largely anthropomorphic approach. From the horseman's viewpoint the result of a race is only secondarily at- tributable to the jockey, trainer, or owner. A race is primarily the horse's responsibility, so to speak, and a winning performance merits the same praise as would be given to a human athlete. Two quotations from the Daily Racing Form are illustrative: lamarelic ... displayed courage in fighting for the leadership. Mack's First ... came gamely through the stretch.3' A poor performance by a horse is on occasion accepted matter-of-factly. Often, however, failure is attributed solely to the horse's disposition. To quote 30. The following illustrate the more graphic type of reporting: 'Petit Bleu had some early foot.' Daily Racing Form, Sept. 7, 1950, p. 4- 'No Parking ... moved menacingly on the turn but hung in the drive.' Ibid., p. 8. As in all sports writing a heavy clich6 content results from the striving for synonyms. For instance, instead of simply stating that a particular person is the jockey, it will be said that he is 'up,' 'aboard,' 'in the saddle,' 'in the irons' or 'astride,' or that he has 'the mount' or 'the leg up.' 3I.
