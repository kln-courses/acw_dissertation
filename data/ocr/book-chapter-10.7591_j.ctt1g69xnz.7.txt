Nietzsche sums up one aspect of the com- plicated, often tortured relationship between the artist and modern  society when he writes: "That is an artist as 1 love artists, modest in  his needs; he really wants only two things, his bread and his art- panem et Circen."l The meaning of the aphorism depends on the  understanding that the society of bread and circuses, as Nietzsche  knew from his own experience, did not aHow artists to enjoy their  bread and art without paying dearly. Central to Nietzsche' s philoso- phy, moreover, is the paradox that the seeming progress of society  reaHy signifies its decadence, a parado x that is also basic to the "dec- adent movement" of artists and poets. "Nothing avails: one must go  forward-step by step further into decadence (that is my definition of  modern 'progress'). "2 Here is the fórmula of aH decadent avant-gardes  and modernist classicisms in the arts, as also of aH decadent "trans- valuations of values" in philosophy. "'Progress' is merely a modern  idea, that is, a false idea" (571). The discoveries of the philosopher and  the innovations of the avant-garde artist take on the appearance of  delvings in a charnel house, using aH the latest equipment. "H is a  painful, horrible spectacle that has dawned on me," writes Nietzsche  in The Anti-Christ. "1 have drawn back the curtain from the corrup- tían of mano ... 1 understand corruption ... in the sense of dec- adence: it is my contention that aH the values in which mankind now  sums up its supreme desiderata are decadence-values" (572). For  Nietzsche, there are always new frontiers to cross, new boundaries to  violate, even of disease. The "progress"-that is, "decadence"-of  modern society forces the artist and philosopher of genius to be also  "progressive," avant-garde, modernist-that is, "decadent."  The first modern versions of negative classicism were the declara- tions of decadence issued by Théophile Gautier and his Bohemian  contemporaries in the 1830S; these were the deliberate antitheses of  bourgeois assertions of progress through industry. The Chevalier d' Al- bert in Gautier's Mademoíselle de Maupin (1835) set the pattern by  likening both his ennui and his pleasures to those of the Roman em- perors: ''Thy gilded house, O Nero! is but a filthy stable beside the  1.

My eircuses are  bloodier and more roaring," and so forth. 3 N evertheless, says d' Al- bert, "nothing 1 ean do has the least attraetion for me." His mock  distress points toward that hedonistie, solipsistie, "deeadent" lifestyle  that is both celebrated and satirized in later fiction: for example, in  Joris-Karl Huysmans's A Rebours, Walter Pater's Marius the Epí- curean, and Osear Wilde's Picture of Dorían Gray.  "We are all emperors of the Lower Empire," said Théophile de  Ferriere, also in 1835. "For are we not in deeadenee?"4 Sinee the  1830S deeadent artists and poets have thought of themselves as fonn- ing an avant-garde of esthetie modernism in the midst of historieal  baeksliding, hastening the downfall of a moribund soeiety by pushing  art beyond the limits of bourgeois toleranee. This esthetic deeadence  contrasted a perversely ideal antiquity-Rome or Byzantium both as  the capital of all pleasure and as neeropolis, the ultimate dead end of  history-to the sterility of industrial modernity. Rome or Byzantium  eould be at onee utopia and dystopia, a model of deeadent behavior to  be admired and imitated but also an exemplar of imperial hubris and  futility-the ironie mirror of the decadents' own bourgeois, indus- trial, imperial soeiety whieh, they declared, was rapidly becoming  another tottering empire like the one that had fallen. They eon- demned the deeadence of their times; they also paraded the dee- adenee of their own art works and lifestyles. The famous first line of  Paul Verlaine's  "Langueur" sums up this delicious eontradietion,  shared by many of the artists and writers who shaped artistic modern- ism in opposition to industrial modernism: "Je suis l'Empire a la fin de  la déeadenee" (1 am the Empire at the end of the decadence).  The ehief faetors that the deeadent movement reaeted against were  progress in the guise of industrialization and the failures and inconsis- tenCÍes that plagued democratization. In Franee, decadent posturing  was inspired partly by the declines and falls that followed the revolu- tions of 1789, 1830, and 1848: the democratie promise of 1789 snuffed  out by Napoleonic imperialism and the Bourbon Restoration; the  3.

Even more devastating  was the "debacle" of the Franco-Prussian vVar followed by the bloody  suppression of the Paris Commune in 1871, which Gustave Flaubert,  for one, saw as an unmitigated catastrophe and the end of French  civilization: "What barbarism! What a disaster! I was hardly a progres- sive and a humanitarian in the past. Nevertheless, I had my illusions!  And I did not believe that I would see the end of the world. But this is  it. We are witnessing the end of the latin world. ",5  Al't er the setbacks suffered by the democratic movements through- out the nineteenth century, many artists and intellectuals adopted  pessimistic, cynical, often reactionary positions. Toward the end of  Emile Zola's Germinal (1885), Etienne Lantier, who has gone through  the hell of a miner' s life and who has seen the innocent "savagery" of  the working class crushed by the "cannibalism" of the bourgeoisie,  continues to dream of liberation. Etienne imagines the proletariat as  the fittest species, overcoming a decadent bourgeoisie (Marxism for  Etienne and perhaps also for Zola is a branch of social Darwinism). In  the same passage, he also imagines the future revolution in terms of a  Roman analogy:  For if one class had to be devoured, surely the people, vigorous and  young, must devour the effete and luxury-loving bourgeoisie? A new  society needed new blood. In this expectation of a new invasion of  barbarians regenerating the decayed nations of the old world, he  rediscovered his absolute faith in a coming revolution, and this time  it would be the real one, whose fires would cast their red glare over  the end of this epoch even as the rising sun was now drenching the  sky in blood. (;  Etienne marches off into the bloody sunrise of the Paris Commune of  1871.  Zola could not have given his novel a more pessimistic conclusion.  Marx viewed the Paris Commune as the harbinger of the final revolu- 5. Gustave Flaubert quoted hy Swart, The Sense of Decadence in Nineteenth·  Century France, p. 124.  6. Emile Zola, Germinal, tr.

But, closer  to Flaubert, Zola interprets the Commune and its aftermath as one  more inevitable disaster for the unfit masses, visited upon them by the  fitter bourgeoisie and the extremely fit Prussians. In Germinal, aH the  revolutionary efforts of the miners end in calamity. The novel reaches  a climax in the desperate machine-breaking riot that also breaks the  back of the strike. The sabotage of the Le Voreux mine by the anar- chist Souvarine kills only miners. Etienne himself emerges from the  ordeal of being buried alive a white-haired skeleton. When he  marches off fuH of hope toward the bloody "debacle" of 1871, he  leaves nothing but disaster in his wake and is headed only toward a  still greater catastrophe.  The entire Rougon-Macquart series of novels, anatomizing life un- der the Second Empire, points deterministically toward the catastro- phes of 1870-71. Zola's naturalism, supposedly applying the latest,  most progressive "experimental" methods to the novel, explores the  decadence of France after 1848 through the disasters and degenera- tions visited upon his characters. Even the more successful side of the  family tree, the Rougons, eventually produces imbeciles and de- formed specimens. The counterfeit imperialism of Napoleon III also  represents a degenerate falling away from that of the first Napoleon.  No wonder that Max Nordau, in his massive exposé of the corruption  of his times, Degeneration (1893), ineludes Zola and other "realists"  alongside esthetes, impressionists, and symbolists as exemplars of  decay. The anatomist of decadence turns out himself to be decadent:  Zola "constantly practices ... that atavistic anthropomorphism and  symbolism ... which is found among savages ... and among the  whole category of degenerates .... Machines are horrible monsters  dreaming of destruction; the streets of Paris open the jaws of Moloch  to devour the human masses; a magasin de modes is an alarming,  supernaturally powerful being."7 There is much truth in Nordau's  assessment. But by identifying the critique of decadence with dec- adence itself, Nordau adopts a line of argument that ought to condemn  his own treatise as an example of degeneracy. More to the point,  despite his superficial antagonism to art-for-art's sake, Zola approxi- mates the many "decadent" poets and symbolists who are Nordau's  7.

Dissecting the decadence of his society, Zola was frequently at- tacked by other anatomists of decay. "Zolaism is a disease. It is a study  of the putrid .... No one can read Zola without moral contamina- tion."8 Condemnations of the "leprous character" and "sheer beastli- ness" of Zola' s novels became rampant in the British press in the late  1880s, at the time of the Vizetelly censorship trial. When the matter of  Victor Vizetelly' s English translations of Zola came befo re Parliament  in 1888, an M.P. wondered: "Were they to stand still while the coun- try was wholly corrupted by literature of this kind? Were they to wait  until the moral fibre of the English race was eaten out, as that of the  French was almost? Look what such literature had done for France. It  overspread that country like a torrent, and its poi son was destroying  the whole nationallife. France, to-day, was rapidly approaching the  condition of Rome in the time of the Caesars."9 This was to attribute,  of course, great corruptive if not constructive power to literature, a  belief that "decadent" writers were quite willing to encourage by  making style their sovereign value, even while they disengaged them- selves as completely as possible from social responsibility. The argu- ments against Zola, moreover, follow the general pattern of arguments  against mass culture as corruptive and decadent. The same M.P. had  no difficulty in associating Zola with the literary "garbage on which  the children of London fed ... the penny dreadful and the penny  novelette." This literature of the masses is poisoning the entire na- tionallife; it constitutes a "terrible pestilence ... spreading through- . out the country."  The association of literary naturalism with negative classicism and  also with the decadent movement is not fortuitous. Both Huysmans,  whose A Rebours served as the pattern book and "breviary" for the  decadent movement, and George Moore, the only British novelist  who tried to be faithful to Zola' s naturalism, began as imitators of Zola  and ended by adopting decadent poses and styles.

"10  And a number of other writers, Flaubert prominent among them,  combine naturalistic and decadent traits.  With his hatred of things utilitarian, industrial, and bourgeois,  Flaubert may be taken as representative of the decadent movement  in France. The opposite of Homais, that smug, detestably progressive  apothecary and citoyen who ironically wins the medal of the Legion of  Honor at the end of Madame Bovary, is perhaps Heliogabalus. The  sadistic, antique splendors of Salammb6 are as inimical to bourgeois,  industrial values as the clichés of Bouvard et Pécuchet are ironically  expressive of them. And Flaubert has his cult of N ero, as Oscar Wilde  and the fin de siecle decadents have theirs of Domitian, Salome, and  Byzantium. Flaubert cultivates "the love of things Roman branching  out into all madnesses, expanding into alllubricities, by turn Egyptian  under Antony, Asiatic at Naples with Nero, Indian with Heliogabalus,  Sicilian, Tartar and Byzantine under Theodorus, and always mingling  sorne blood with its roses, and always displaying its red flesh under  the arcade of its grand circus where the lions roared, where the hippo- potamuses swam, where the Christians died."l1  At the same time that Flaubert exemplifies many of the themes and  attitudes of the decadent movement, he also points toward that ex- treme development of realism which Zola called naturalismo He de- nied being a realist, and would also have denied being a decadent, a  naturalist, or anything el se programmatic. But Salammb6 reveals the  axis along which naturalism and the decadent movement are joined.  Flaubert' s agonizingly precise realistic techniques are lavished upon a  story that is essentially nihilistic. Salammb6 comes close to fulfilling  Flaubert's ambition to write "a book about nothing, a book without  external attachments, which would hold together by itself through the  10.

"12 Just as much as Zola in Germinal,  Flaubert is dealing with a historical cul-de-sac. The sadistic triumphs  and lapidary splendors of Carthage lead nowhere but to treachery and  destruction, the decimation of the barbarians who seem at least to  embody some wild freedom, and the torture and death of Matho by  the entire "civilized" population of the capital. AIso, of course, Car- thage itself is doomed to destruction in an even more ruinous and final  way than Rome. Rome at least, as Sainte-Beuve declared, points to- ward "the whole future of civilization"; but Carthage is only a nec- ropolis, devoid of hopeo  Flaubert's Carthage represents in extreme form the futility, cruel- ty, and desolation of all empires; the entire history of civilization takes  on the aspect of a death factory. Salammb8 belongs partly to the  memento mori genre exemplified by Constantin Fran&lt;;ois Volney's  Ruins; Flaubert populates the ruins with a horde of cruel, exotic  ghosts. But as Georg Lukács suggests in The Historícal Novel (1962),  Salammb8 resolutely refuses to be a political statement or to point a  finger out of the past at the crimes of the presento The historical dead  end of Carthage is mirrored in the total disjunction between  Flaubert's narrative and immediate social concerns: the novelist re- fuses to judge; the work of art exists in a state of hermetic splendor;  the supreme value is style. Flaubert's is the stance of the decadent  practitioner of art-for-art' s sake, although the stance itself is in an  important way political: a decadent estheticism, by which art no long- er connects with anything but art, is obviously antithetical to anything  like mass art, anything manufactured for consumption by the masses.  Salammb8 is thus an implicit condemnation of the decadent, bour- geois, industrial society that casts the arts into the outer darkness of a  modish alienation. Only across the barricade of Flaubert's  deliberate  isolation can Hamilcar' s prophecy of the downfall of Carthage, for  example, be read as pointing also to modern France: "You willlose  your ships, your lands, your chariots, your hanging beds, the slaves  who rub your feet! Jackals will lie down in your palaces, the plough  will turn up your graves. Nothing will remain but the eagles' cry and  heaps of ruins. You will fall, Carthage!"13  12.

Lukács argues that Salammbó's  "frozen, lunar landscape of archaeological precision" betrays a false  "modernization of history"; a dead Carthage is made to stand in the  place of a dying modernity. Lukács finds the result not far removed  from naturalism: "Only in Flaubert's imagination does Mátho embody  ancient love. In reality, he is a prophetic model of the decadent  drunkards and madmen of Zola."14 The treacheries, triumphs, and  disasters of the Carthaginians are no different in kind from those of  modern France. History is both static and endlessly repetitious for  Flaubert, because human nature never progresses. Flaubert' s fre- quent descriptions of jewels and precious metals as features of  clothing and architecture, the ornaments of a cruelly static necropolis  petrified in the sands of the past, are also suggestive of the way history  always works: imperializing civilization seems inevitably to transform  the raw materials of humanity into piles of useless wealth, and then  again into piles of bones and ruins. Like the golden bird in Yeats' s  Byzantium poems, the lapidary brilliance of Carthage seems to exist  outside of time, beyond "the fury and the mire" ofhistory. But where- as Yeats's Byzantium represents at least the mirage of eternality, the  chief god of Flaubert's Carthage is Moloch the Devourer, to whom  belongs "men's existence, their very flesh," and to whom frequent  sacrifice must be made "to still his fury." Flaubert might just as well  have said that Mammon is the chief god of his fellow Parisians; in  L'education sentimentale, we are told that after the revolution of 1848,  despite "the most humanitarian legislation ever passed in France ...  property was raised to the level of Religion and became indis- tinguishable from God. "15  From the outset the decadent movement was profoundly anti- bourgeois, anti-industrial, and also antidemocratic. The antithesis of a  genuine work of art is whatever can be understood and consumed by  "the public," "the masses," "the canaille."

"l6 History has been a  declension from the days when heroic artists could forge their will  against the unwitting mediocrity of the mas ses down to modern times,  when the bourgeoisie with their factories and their profit mongering  have made the pursuit of the beautiful nearly impossible:  The world was flooded with all that was beautiful, until there arose a  new class, who discovered the cheap, and foresaw fortune in the  facture of the sham.  Then sprang into existence the tawdry, the common, the geegaw.  The taste of the tradesman supplanted the science of the artist,  and what was born of the mil!ion went back to them, and charmed  them, for it was after their own heart; and the great and the smal!,  the statesman and the slave, took to themselves the abomination that  was tendered, and preferred it~and have lived with it ever since!  And the artist's occupation was gone, and the manufacturer and  the huckster took his place. 17  This is the central myth of the esthetic decadents, expressed in one  form or another in aH of their manifestoes and works of arto It foHows  that a novel like Salammbó stands as a deliberate if implicit protest  against any idea of art as a utilitarian or profitable or progressive or  industrial activity. Like many later modernist artists and writers, the  decadents aimed to produce works of art that were completely anti- thetical to mass culture, or to whatever seemed vulgar and cheap  enough to be appreciated by the bourgeoisie and the masses below  them.  If Salammhó is attached to the present only by indirection, Huys- mans' s A Rehours is very much a novel about contemporary dec- adence: the decline and faH of Des Esseintes, victim of urban-indus- trial malaise, ennui, and syphilis, reflects in miniature the fate of  modern civilization. The decadent hero suffers from "that peculiar  malady which ravages effete, enfeebled races." Des Esseintes repre- sents a morihund aristocracy, which there is no hope of reviving: "The  decayed nohility was done for; the aristocracy had sunk into imhecility  or depravity.

"18 Huysmans' s language is unmistakably both Darwinian  and Zolaesque; he applies an evolutionary but degenerative determin- ism to entire classes and societies. Huysmans did not leave naturalism  behind to write decadent "breviaries"; rather, he found the theme of  decadence ready-made in Zola and the Concourt brothers and applied  it to the upper end of the social register. A Rebours portrays the other  side of the landscape of social disaster depicted in Germinal: both Des  Esseintes and Etienne Lantier, both aristocracy and working class, are  doomed at least metaphorically to be eaten alive by the fittest species,  the bourgeoisie. "What point of contact," Des Esseintes wonders,  "could there possibly be between him and that bourgeois class which  had gradually climbed to the top, taking advantage of every disaster to  fill its pickets, stirring up every sort of trouble to command respect for  its countless crimes and thefts?" The commercialism of the bour- geoisie devours everything that stands in its way, like the cannibal god  of capital in Germinal. "Overbearing and underhand in behavior, base  and cowardly in character, [the bourgeoisie] ruthlessly shot down its  perennial and essential dupe, the mob, which it had previously un- muzzled and sent flying at the throats of the old castes." The impact  on culture ofbourgeois domination and crassness, needless to say, has  heen catastrophic: "the suppression of all intelligence, the negation of  all honesty, the destruction of all art" (218). Des Esseintes's attempt to  create a sanctuary of esthetic sensation, walled off from the cultural  depredations of the bourgeoisie, prefigures the pattern of many later  attacks upon mass culture as sham, disease, or commercial cannibal- ism, an apocalyptic category of decline and fallo  In an important way, however, Des Esseintes does not merely  despair of the future; he delights masochistically in his own deteriora- tion and in the idea of the ultimate downfall of society at large. In- spired by reading Dickens, Des Esseintes conjures up a vision of  London and even sets off on a trip to visit it, though he gets no farther  than Paris. His London vis ion is replete with dockside scenes, street  traffic, fog, the roar and bustle ofbusiness and industry, and it ends on  18. Joris-Karl Huysmans, Agaínst Nature, tr.

Here is the atavistic world of Germinal, in which "machines are horri- ble monsters dreaming of destruction," but viewed through an opera  glass of esthetic sensation.  The same sense of perverse enjoyment characterizes the theme of  negative classicism in Huysmans's story. Des Esseintes's evocations of  the crepuscular style of Latin decadence, which lead him to recount  the decline and fall of ancient civilization, are high on his list of  pleasures. He is especially fond of Petronius's Satyricon, which he  reads as a "realistic novel, [a] slice cut from Roman life in the raw"; of  Claudian, who "caUs Antiquity back to life" while "the Western Em- pire crumble[s] to its ruin aU about him"; and ofTertuUian, that sine  qua non of negative classicism, who "had gone on calmly writing his  sermons ... while the Roman Empire tottered" (45). Not that Des  Esseintes pays heed to the content of the gloomy African's sermons:  while TertuUian was preaching "carnal abstinence, frugality of diet,  sobriety of dress . . . Elagabalus was treading in silver dust and sand  of gold, his head crowned with a tiara and his clothes studded with  jewels, working at women' s tasks in the midst of his eunuchs, calling  himself Empress and bedding every night with a new Emperor,  picked for choice from among his barbers, scullions, and charioteers."  Des Esseintes, we are told, delights in this contrast, but of course it is  Heliogabalus upon whom he models his own behavior. Even more  than the behavior of perverse emperors, however, it is the literary  style of the Roman decadence that Des Esseintes admires. He is  enamored of "that special gamy flavour which in the fourth century- and even more in the foUowing centuries-the odour of Christianity  was to give to the pagan tongue as it decomposed like venison, drop- ping to pieces at the same time as the civilization of the Ancient  World, falling apart while the Empires succumbed to the barbarian  onslaught and the accumulated pus of ages" (46).  Des Esseintes's  fondness for decadent Latin is anything but pedan- tic. Far from a quiet rummaging among old books, his account of  linguistic decadence leads to passages ofbloodthirsty, apocalyptic lyri- cism, reaching a crescendo in this evocation of the barbarian in- vasions:  </page> <page sequence="13"> Some Nineteenth-Century Themes 125  On the banks of the Danube, thousands of men wrapped in ratskin  cloaks and mounted on little horses, hideous Tartars with enormous  heads, flat noses, hairless, jaundiced faces, and chins furrowed with  gashes and scars, rode hell-for-Ieather into the territories of the  Lower Empire, sweeping all before them in their whirlwind ad- vanee. . . . Civilization disappeared in the dust of their horses'  hooves, in the smoke of the fires they kindled. Darkness fell upon  the world and the peoples trembled in consternation as they listened  to the dreadful tornado pass by with a sound like thunder. The horde  of Huns swept over Europe .... The earth, gorged "with blood,  looked like a sea of crimson frath; two hundred thousand corpses  barred the way and broke the impetus of the invading avalanche  which, turned fram its path, felllike a thunderbolt on Italy, whose  ruined cities burned like blazing hay-ricks. [49)  If Zola had written a novel about the fall of the Roman Empire, it  would have sounded like this. In any case, Des Esseintes's love of  decadence clearly also involves a love of barbarism and scenes of  destruction. Huysmans leads us on an ironic path fram his protago- nist' s fastidious and eccentric bibliophile tastes to images of the  smashing of civilizations. What is the connection between the two?  Perhaps only the meanderings of Des Esseintes' s depraved imagina- tion. But the very insistence on style as the supreme value seems to  lead to scenes of desolation; it functions like a kind of vampirism,  leaving the world symbolically incoherent, ravaged, falling into ruins.  The emphasis on style is evident in every important decadent man- ifesto. The decadents were far fram being linguistic purists, however,  seeking to prap up a tottering civilization by improving its rhetoric.  The styles they valued most were themselves supposedly diseased,  corrupt. Their classicism was primarily negative; their avant-garde  modernism resuscitated the writers of a twilight age. In his preface to  Les fleurs du mal, Gautier defines Baudelaire's "style of decadence"  as "nothing other than art reaching the point of extreme maturity  determined by the oblique suns of aging civilizations: a style inge- nious, complicated, knowing, full of nuances and affectations.

Gautíer quotes a statement that  Baudelaire attached to a Latin poem in Les fleurs du mal: "Does it not  seem . . . that the language of the final Latín decadence-supreme  sigh of a robust person already transformed and prepared for the life of  the spirit-is singularly able to express the passion which the modern  poetic world understands and feels?" Out of their impotenee and rage  in the faee of bourgeois hegemony, decadent writers sought their  revenge by declaring style, that seel11ingly least powerfúl value, to he  their private monopoly, off limits to the bourgeoisie. Style was a  mystery beyond the ken of ordinary mortals. The effect of so treating  it, however, was like removing, at least in imagination, the keystone  from the grand arch of civilization. Here was a whole generation of  writers who l11ight have be en singing the praises of the Freneh Seeond  Empire or of the British Empire, but who declared instead that those  empires were doomed. They even seemed to be hastening decline  and fa11 by imitating the decadent Romans and by cultivating linguistic  eorruptions and eeeentricities, like magical incantatíons against the  powers-that-be. And one and a11 they subscribed to the heresy that  modern society was not following the path of progress, but its  opposite.  II  Just as much as the failures and disillusionments attendant upon  democratization, industrialization was a cause of dismay for many  nineteenth-century artists and intelleetuals. The idea that machinery  is destructive of art and culture arose with the factory system. The fú11  history of how artists have responded to the threats of specific new  machine techniques-steam printing and linotyping, lithography,  photography, the telegraph and telephone, radio, cinema, televi- sion-has yet to be written, but it would deal with everything that we  now categorize as mass media. Flaubert again can serve as an exam- pIe: "Let us cry against imitation silk, desk chairs, economy kitchens,  take materials, fake luxury, fake pride. Industrialism has developed  the ugly to gigantic proportions .... The department store has ren- dered true luxury difficult ... we have a11 become fakers and char- latans ....

"20 The equation of machinery with  degeneration rather than with progress, paradoxically central to many  versions of literary and artistic modernism, was in part a defensive  reaction to the displacement of traditional arts and crafts by methods  ofmechanical reproduction. 21 Zola's naturalism also shows the indus- trial present as retrograde, brutal, destructive of humane values and  of the masses who, though inevitably the victims ofhistory, still some- times exhibit tragic or heroic qualities. Both the decadent movement  and naturalism are anti-industrial, and the former at least is thor- oughly antidemocratic as well: no good is to be expected either from  mass production or from the masses, the two main ingredients in the  modern idea of mass culture.  George Moore, that Irish-Parisian mimic of a11late-nineteenth-cen- tury fads and isms, including both naturalism and decadence, can  condemn the degeneracy of modern industrial society in one passage  and invoke the macabre splendors of fa11ing Rome in the next. In his  Confessions of a Young Man (1888), Moore writes: "Oh, for the si- lence of marble courts, for the shadow of great pillars, for gold, for  reticulated canopies of lilies; to see the great gladiators pass, to hear  them cry the famous 'Ave Caesar,' to hold the thumb down, to see the  blood flow, to fi11 the languid hours with the agonies of poisoned  slaves! Oh, for excess, for crime!"22 No doubt this is the decadent  movement at its most jejune, but the same double purpose occurs in  the other celebrators of Roman degeneracy, from Gautier and  Flaubert to Huysmans and Wilde. As antique decadence is praised, so  modern decadence, supposedly caused by industrialization and de- mocratization, is condemned. "The world is dying of machinery," says  Moore; "that is the great disease, that is the plague that will sweep  away and destroy civilization; man will have to rise against it sooner or  later." Moore is perhaps echoing William Morris when he adds: "1 say  the great and the reasonable revolution will be when mankind rises in  revolt, and smashes the machinery and restores the handicrafts" (113).

"A Machine is not aMan nor a  Work of Art," wrote Wi11iam Blake; "it is destructive of Humanity &amp;  of Art."23 As early as 1804, Blake condemned England's "dark satanic  mi11s" for destroying the original Eden or Jerusalem of "England's  green and pleasant land," while in 1829 Robert Southey could write  that "everything connected with manufactures presents ... features  of unqualified deformity." Like Blake' s, Southey' s rejection of the  factories was as much esthetic as economic and humanitarian. Samuel  Taylor Coleridge also thought that industrialism, at least if a110wed to  regulate itself according to the self-justifying laws of political econo- my, was amenace to culture and to "human personality." Spinning an  archaeological fantasy, Coleridge said of the new science of economics  that "it would dig up the charcoal foundations of the temple of  Ephesus to bum as fuel for a steam-engine. "24  In France, a similar hostility toward industrialism appears at least  by the 1830S. Long before Baudelaire attacked "the fanaticism of  utensils," Stendhal decried "industrialism, second cousin to charlata- nism"; Sainte-Beuve anatomized the "industrialization of literature";  and Balzac's Illusions perdues (1837-43) exposed the destructive ef- fects of commercial and industrial techniques on poetry.

Three decades into the nineteenth century,  Thomas Carlyle penned his first accounts of how "the huge demon of  Mechanism" was calling forth "whole multitudes of workmen" who  needed somehow to be "organized" and led by some principIe higher  than "Mammonism." The protagonists ofCarlyle's French Revalution,  Chartism, and Past and Present are the industrialized masses, looking  for upper-class he roes and leaders. In Chartism, Carlyle applies a  Roman analogy to the industrial scene of 1839, suggesting that new  chieftains must arise to lead the new barbarian hordes abroad-thus  anticipating by nearly a century Spengler's and Ortega's identifica- tions of "masses" with "barbarism." "Now once more, as at the end of  the Roman Empire, a most confused epoch and yet one of the great- est, the Teutonic Countries find themselves too full. On a certain  western rim of our small Europe, there are more men than were  expected. "26 Where, then, Carlyle asks, are the new "Hengsts and  Alarics ... who, when their home is grown too narrow, will enlist  and, like fire-pillars, guide onwards those superfluous masses of in- domitable living Valour; equipped, not now with the battle-axe and  war chariot, but with the steam-engine and ploughshare?"  Just as much as the doctrine of "hero worship," such a solution to  the Malthusian problem of "superfluous masses" makes Carlyle sound  like a precursor of fascism, as H. C. Grierson and others have claimed  him to be. The equation may be anachronistic, but it is still true that  the Malthusian image of"masses," associated with industrial regimen- tation and unemployment, became tragically linked to rationalizations  not just for emigration but also for imperialistic expansion, as in this  1904 German call for Lebensraum:  A people needs Iand for its activities, Iand for its nourishment. No  people needs it as much as the German people which is increasing so  rapidly and whose old boundaries have become dangerously narrow.  If we do not soon acquire new territories, we are moving towards a  frightful catastrophe .... Once more, as 2000 years ago when the  Cimbri and the Teutons were hammering at the gates of Rome,  26.

Malthusianism may seem unrelated to the concerns of the decadent  movement. Germinal, however, with its blunt depiction of the sex  lives of the proletariat, "germinating" children to add to the "super- fluous masses," is very much a Malthusian novel. And, though in  reverse, so is A Rebours: Des Esseintes represents the sexual dead  end of the aristocracy, its failure to match the other classes in re- producing its own kind. In his influential tract on decadence, Essais  de psychologie contemporaine (1880-83), Paul Bourget defines a soci- ety on the wane as one "which produces too large a number of in di- viduals who are unsuited to the labours of the common life." These are  the masses of the unemployed and the poorly employed, everyone  from paupers and miners on strike to decadent poets like Baudelaire  and depraved aristocrats like Des Esseintes, whom Bourget sees as  visited by the same deadly and insatiable craving for sensation which  plagued Nero and Heliogabalus. According to Bourget:  A society should be like an organismo Like an organism, in fact, it  may be resolved into a federation of smaller organisms, which may  themselves be resolved into a federation of cells. The individual is  the social cell. In order that the organism should perform its func- tions with energy it is necessary that the organisms composing it  should perform their functions with energy, but with a subordinated  energy .... If the energy of the cells becomes independent, the  lesser organisms will likewise cease to subordinate their energy to  27. Quoted in Louis Synder, ed., The Imperialism Reader (Princeton: Van  Nostrand, 1962), p. 89.  </page> <page sequence="19"> Some Nineteenth-Century Themes  the total energy and the anarchy which is established constitutes the  decadence of the whole. 28  Bourget offers an early, Darwinian and Malthusian version of the  theory of the atomization that takes place in a mass society. The same  "law" which governs the disintegration of the social organism, more- over, also governs the disintegration of language: "A style of dec- adence is one in which the unity of the book is decomposed to give  place to the independence of the page, in which the page is decom- posed to give place to the independence of the phrase, and the phrase  to give place to the independence of the word." Such was the style of  the writers of the Latin decadence; and such is the style of the dec- adent writers of modern Europe. In The Case ofWagner, Nietzsche  paraphrases this passage from Bourget and conc1udes that decadence  appears "every time there is an anarchy of atoms. "29  The Malthusian side of Bourget's theory, according to which a de- c1ining society throws up superfluous individuals, seems to conflict  with an exactly contrary idea: that a state of decadence arises from a  weakening of the sexual impulse and consequently from under- rather  than from over-population. This is Huysmans's version of the dec- adence of the aristocracy. In its later stages, according to Bourget,  "Roman society failed to produce enough children; it therefore could  no longer put enough soldiers in the neldo The citizens ceased to care  for the routines of parentage" (27). Bourget goes on to defend dec- adence, partly in these terms: if the members of a declining society  "are poor reproducers offuture generations," they may turn instead to  the reproduction of an "abundance" of "nne sensations" and "rarened  sentiments . . . sterilised but renned." By implication, the problem  of overpopulation or of the production of superfluous masses is here  taken out of the hands of the effete, dec1ining civilization and attached  instead to the image ofbarbarian hordes.

In contrast to the romantics and decadents, the first political econo- mists equate machinery with progress. But whereas they might be  expected to show how the masses can gradually be transformed into a  prosperous, democratic public through industrial expansion, they not  only rationalize the existing distribution of property but also fail to  show conclusively how capitalism can cure poverty. Indeed, Thomas  Malthus and David Ricardo seem to prove that the progress of society  does not mean and perhaps can never mean progress for the poor.  Malthus's Essay on Population (1798) negates all prospects for the  betterment of "the lower orders" through "systems of equality" and  through schemes of government relief like the poor laws. 30 U nless  "checked" by "moral restraint," population will always outgrow sub- sistence only to be checked in harsher ways by warfare, disease, or  famine. At the same time, as Ricardo shows even more clearly than  Malthus, industrial expansion will not necessarily help the poor ei- ther. To Malthus's theory of overpopulation, Ricardo adds the prob- lem of technological unemployment. Together, they suggest that even  under the best industrial conditions there will be unemployment, or,  to use Malthus's phrase, a "redundant population": "the poor ye shall  always have with you." No wonder that Carlyle calls the "science" of  bourgeois progress "dismal." At the heart of bustling rationalizations  of industrialism and free trade looms up the specter of "the masses" as  "redundant population," ominous, haggard, a hideous "swann" cast- ing its pall over England' s green and pleasant land.  Just as much as against machinery and "the factory system," the  first romantics set themselves against Malthusianism. As early as  1803, Southey writes that Malthus's Essay has become "the political  bible of the rich, the selfish, and the sensual. "31 He sees at least dimly  30. Thomas Malthus, Essay an the Principal af PapuZatian, 2 vols. (London: Every- man's Library, 1932). Malthus also has his version of the decline and fall of empires.  Rome's fall was due to moral degeneracy including a failure to attend to agriculture.  "The pernicious custom of importing great quantities of corn to distribute, gratuitously  among the people," Malthus says, "had given it [agriculture? the Empire?] a blow  from which it never afterwards recovered" (1: 149). Like all forms of relief to the poor,  the bread side of the bread and circuses policy Malthus regards as ruinous. Asevere  moralist, he does not mention circuses.  31. Robert Southey quoted by Harold A. Bonar, Hungry Generations (New York:  King's Crown, 1955), p. 69·  </page> <page sequence="21"> Some Nineteenth-Century Themes 133  the main fallacy in Malthus's  argument, which is that poverty ante- dates overpopulation and is the result of preexisting arrangements of  property and power, not of "imprudence." Wordsworth, Coleridge,  Byron, Hazlitt, Shelley, and Carlyle also lash out against "sophisms  like those of Mr. Malthus," which according to Shelley are "calculated  to lull the oppressors of mankind into a security of everlasting tri- umph."32 There was in fact a torrent of anti-Malthusian literature  written between 1820 and 1850, much of it summarized in Harold  Bonar's able study Hungry Generations, which takes its title from  Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale":  Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!  No hungry generations tread thee down- an allusion that suggests the extent to which romanticism and the new  political economy were incompatible with each other, but that also  suggests how much both groups of intellectuals, the romantics and the  economists, are troubled by the Malthusian specter of a "redundant  population" of the unemployed, uprooted poor.  Keats' s lines point to the dilemma that other writers and artists- John Ruskin, William Morris, Leo Tolstoy-explore more thoroughly  later in the century: the difficulty or perhaps impossibility of fulfilling  cultural ideals in the midst of injustice, poverty, class conflict, and  industrial regimentation and squalor. Even those intellectuals who  most vigorously deny the validity of Malthus' s arguments of course do  not deny the existence of alienated masses of the dispossessed and  disfranchised. But often the romantics are thrown back upon solutions  to "the social question" which are not far from those advocated by  Malthus. In The Excursion, for example, Wordsworth rejects Malthus  but lamely recommends emigration as a cure for overpopulation. Brit- ain should "cast off / her swarms" by shipping them overseas. 33 Simi- larly, Carlyle rains down wrath on Malthus, whom he accuses of  wanting to murder the poor (like "Marcus," the author of the notori- ous Book of Murder-a nineteenth-century "Modest Proposa!"). But  Carlyle also adopts the language of "swarms" and "masses" and a  32. Shelley, preface to The Revolt of Islam.  33.

It is obviously on the idea of the masses as alienated- "superfluous," unemployed or employed only as the tools of other  people' s tools-that Marxism is grounded. Industrialization devours  the old class alignments and the natural environment as well, convert- ing the potentially democratic "people" into rich and poor, and de- humanizing both classes in the process-"people" become capital and  labor, owners and masses. Abstract or mechanical money relations- Carlyle' s "cash nexus"-in urban industrial centers take the place of  older, local, perhaps simpler and perhaps kindlier relations in natural  or rural settings. The peasantry, wrenched from the land by the en- closure movement, by overpopulation, and by both aristocratic and  bourgeois greed, is converted into a new and dangerous sort of indus- trial cannon fodder. The new factories spew out commodities, includ- ing the "most wretched of commodities," the proletariat. Marx sum- marizes: "The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of  Modern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential prod- uct."34 Thus the bourgeoisie manufactures its own undoing, "the  masses" who, "crowded into the factory, are organized like soldiers."  "The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the  ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself. But not only has  the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has  also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons- the modern working class-the proletarians" (340).  Throughout their writings, Marx and Engels often liken the masses  to slaves and sometimes to barbarians on the Roman model; for Marx  and Engels too, it appears, "the tradition of all the dead generations  weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living." Spartacus ranks  high on the list of Marxist saints, and "barbarism" is cherished both  for its destructive and for its rejuvenative powers. In one of Engels's  last essays, moreover, the revolutionary masses are not just the de- stroyers of an old civilization, but the founders of a new one:  34.

It  undermined religion and al! the foundations of the state; it flatly  denied that Caesar's  law was the supreme law; it was without a  fatherland, was international; it spread over al! countries of the em- pire, from Gaul to Asia, and beyond the frontiers of the empire. It  had long carried on seditious activities in secret, underground; for a  considerable time, however, it had felt itself strong enough to come  out into the open. This party of overthrow was known by the name of  Christians. 35  No doubt Marx would have approved ofEngels's Roman analogy only  in the sense that communism seeks to realize in this life the ideals  of  freedom and equality disembodied and inverted in Christian eschatol- ogy. The promise of religion becomes the promise of the liberation  and humanization of the masses, their "de-reification," but outside  the churches, without benefit of clergy, who cannot accept the trans- mutation of theological illusions into materialistic goals. In much the  same way, whatever is valid-that is, aiming toward the construction  of a just society-in the culture of the past will remain valid, although  outside the elitist institutions and without benefit of clerisy or of the  critics, artists, and professors who insist that the class culture to which  they are devoted is all-sufficing or that it can resolve the injustices of a  class-divided society.36 To Marx and Engels, the choice was clear:  "either barbarism or socialism." Citing Engels as the source of this  phrase, Rosa Luxemburg could write in the midst of World War I:  This world war means a reversion to barbarismo The triumph of  imperialism leads to the destruction of culture, sporadical!y during a  modern war, and forever, if the period of world wars that has just  begun is al!owed to take its damnable course to the last ultimate  consequence. Thus we stand today, as Friedrich Engels proph- esied . . . before the awful proposition: either the triumph of impe- rialism and the destruction of al! culture, and, as in ancient Rome,  depopulation, desolation, degeneration, a vast cemetery; or, the  victory of socialism, that is, the conscious struggle of the interna- tional proletariat against imperialism, against its methods, against  35.

This is the dilemma of world history, its inevitable choice,  whose scales are trembling in the balance awaiting the decision of  the proletariat. 37  From Luxemburg's perspective, imperialism and war are the worst,  last results of the failure to organize the "superfluous masses" through  socialismo From the perspective of the decadent movement, imperial- ism and the masses may seem like social problems to be resolutely  ignored, but it is clear that a vis ion similar to Luxemburg's underlies  all decadent invocations of Roman imperialism and barbarian inva- sions. Empire is the state of society before the final collapse, at the  edge of the precipice, of barbarism, of the new Dark Age.  iii  Ten years before the start of World War 1, in terms like Luxem- burg' s, Anatole Franee declared: "Imperialism is the most reeent form  of barbarism, the end of the line for civilization. 1 do not distinguish  between the two terms-imperialism and barbarism-for they mean  the same thing. "38 When Franee wrote, however, the paradoxieal  equation ofbarbarism with empire was less familiar than the view that  overseas expansion eoupled with industrial growth was leading to the  gradual elimination of "barbarism" and "savagery" and to the installa- tion of "eivilization" around the world. From the perspective of the  defenders of empire, the "barbarians" waiting to be transformed into  their better selves might be the industrial masses, but were also and  more obviously the "eoloured," "inferior" raees in Afriea and Asia- the "new-caught, sullen peoples, / Half devil and half child," as Kip- ling ealled them. The rhetorie of a civilizing mission and "the white  man' s burden" was the basie stuff not only of imperialist or "jingoist"  journalism, but also of mueh literature written from about 1880 down  to World War 1, the same period in whieh the deeadent movement  reaehed its peak. The languages of jingoism and of deeadence, the  praise of empires and the prophecies of their doom, are the contrary  37. Rosa Luxemburg, "The Junius Pamphlet" (1916), in Rosa Luxemburg Speaks,  ed.

Of the British writers who defended empire. none was more promi- nent than Kipling, who was, as George Olwe11 put it, "the prophet of  British imperialism in its expansionist phase. ";39 Kipling' s reputation  has inevitably been bound up with his position as an imperial pro- pagandist, with critics taking sides in a dispute more ideological than  esthetic. In an early attack on Kipling as "the voice of the hooligan,"  Robert Buchanan writes: "There is a universal scramble for plunder,  for excitement, for amusement, for speculation, al1(l, aboye it a11, the  flag of a Hooligan Imperialism is raised, with the proclamation that it  is the sole mission of Anglo-Saxon England, forgetful of the task of  keeping its own drains in order, to expand and extend its boundaries  indefinitely, and, again in the name of the Christianity it has prac- tica11y abandoned, to conquer and inherit the earth." 40 As in the days  of ancient Rome, Buchanan thinks, the upper classes are bribing the  working class with the cheap stuff of a "spectacular" patriotism, to  which Kipling is contributing: "The mob, promised a merry time by  the governing classes, just as the old Roman mob was deluded by  bread and pageants-panem et circenses-dances merrily to patriotic  war-tunes, while that modern monstrosity and anachronism, the con- servative working man, exchanges his birthright of freedom and free  thought for a pat on the head from any little rump-fed lord that steps  his way and spouts the platitudes of cockney patriotism" (235).  Buchanan offers us Juvenal redone into Victorian English. That Kip- ling is a defender of British imperialism is obvious, but his "hooliga- nism" is partly qualified by the fact that much of his propaganda  takes the form of warnings to deal with empire responsibly, in the  spirit of civilizing rather than exploiting: imperialists must "take up  the white man' s burden." This is the message underlying Kipling' s  own frequent comparisons of British with Roman imperialism, where  the Roman decline serves as warning-for example, in the Roman  Wa11 stories in Puck of Pook's Hill.  39.

Especially in his African  stories, based on his experiences in the Belgian Congo in 1890, Con- rad appears to condemn civilization as skin-deep, a rapacious fraud.  The two European traders in "An Outpost of Progress, " Kayerts and  Carlier, go mad in the jungle and destroy each other over a bit of  sugar. Conrad tells us that these specimens of civilization "could only  live on condition of being machines." They are mass men, whom  civilization has protected and programmed and whom the wilderness  has "liberated" to the horror of their own nothingness. The story  clearly implies that between civilizabon and the savagery that wor- ships fetishes and practices cannibalism there is little to choose. Simi- larly, in ''rhe Heart of Darkness," the metamorphosis of Kurtz sug- gests that civilizabon is merely a veneer and that its vaunted superior- ity to savagery is a sham, like the lie that Marlow tells Kurtz' s  "intended" at the end of the story.  Rather than as indictments of imperialism in general, however,  Conrad' s African stories should perhaps be more narrowly interpreted  as reflecting his Congo experiences. It is not clear, for example, that  what he says in "The Heart of Darkness" about the Eldorado Explor- ing Expedition Cto tear treasure out of the bowels of the land was  their desire, with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there is  in burglars breaking into a safe") is aimed at a larger target than King  Leopold Irs  murderous central African venture, which was a scandal  to both the friends and the enemies of European expansiono 41 What is  clear is that Conrad gene rally thinks of British as superior to other  European imperialisms. When Marlow describes the African map in  the company office in Brussels, "marked with all the colours of a  rainbow," he says: ''rhere was a vast amount of red-good to see at  any time, because one knows that sorne real work is done in there," in  contrast to all the other colors, including yellow for the Belgian Con- go, "dead in the center." Conrad's tale tells us something of the  "horror" that goes on in the yellow part of the map, equating imperial- ist rapacity with the "unspeakable rites" practiced by Kurtz.  Idol worship is the common denominator uniting Europeans and  41. Joseph Conrad, ''The Heart of Darkness," in Youth and Two Other Stories,  ~lalay Edition (Carden City, N.

Not only is Kurtz worshiped as  an idol, but he indulges in his own worshi~r, what amounts to the  same thing, in his own self-aggrandizement and the sacrifice of other  lives to it. The "pilgrims" at the trading station worship ivory, money,  advancement, and also Kurtz's reputation. And Kurtz's "intended"  back in Europe worships her heroic image of Kurtz as civilizer. Even  Marlow is not immune from fetishism, sitting cross-Iegged on deck  like a Buddha as he expresses his own worship of Kurtz as a superior  person able to confront "the horror" within us aH. Of imperialism in  general, Marlow thinks quite cynicaHy: "The conquest of the earth,  which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different  complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty  thing when you look into it too much." But he adds: "What redeems it  is the idea only." A moral purpose, progress, a civilizing mission- these, presumably, can justify imperialismo Marlow-Conrad does not  rest content with this justification, however; he equates the belief in a  redeeming idea also with idol worship: "An idea at the back of it"  justifies imperialism, but is also "something you can set up, and bow  down before, and offer a sacrifice too . . ."  This passage, which both gives and takes away one of the two  justifications for imperialism that Marlow offers, comes at the end of  an extended comparison between Roman and British imperialism, in  which Marlow accuses the Romans of operating only by "brute force"  and "robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and  men going at it blind," although he adds: "as is very proper for those  who tackle a darkness." The British, however, are saved from being  no better than the Romans by "efficiency-the devotion to efficien- cy"-or does "devotion" suggest idol worship again? In any case,  "efficiency" is the secondjustification for empire which Marlow offers.  But his account leaves it far from clear that things are very much  better now than when the Romans conquered Britain. "And this also,"  Marlow begins his tale, "has been one of the dark places  on the  earth." Thus it was when the Romans arrived, conquering, looting,  murdering. Now "darkness" seems to be restricted to "the Dark Con- tinent," and more especiaHy to the yeHow, blue, and green parts of  the map; but the meaning of Kurtz' s regression and of Marlow' s He to  his "intended" is also to generalize darkness, to show that "this"- England, anywhere-is still "one of the dark places on the earth."  It is obviously harder to see Conrad as an imperiaHst than to see  </page> <page sequence="28"> BREAD AND CIRCUSES  Kipling as the poet of empire. What unites them perhaps more than  any degree of political agreement are the patterns of social and psy- chological regression in their stories. Despite their more strident pa- trio tic emphases, many of Kipling' s tales-"The Mark of the Beast,"  "Namgay Doola," "Without Benefit of Clergy," even Kim, to name  just a few--describe the shedding of civilization by Europeans rather  than the civilizing ofIndians. It would be difficult to find in Kipling an  example of a successfully Europeanized Indian; the movement seems  all in the other direction. Even his best moral specimens, like those in  "William the Conqueror," seem almost to be pushing duty and work  as a way of avoiding the temptations of "going native." Kim cannot  make up his mind whether to be white or to go native, but the  attractions are clearly on the native side. And a story such as "The  Man Who Would Be King" seems almost a parable against imperial- ism, warning of inevitable downfall to those who invade primitive  societies and meddle with their customs. The characters in Conrad' s  Mrican tales also undergo obvious, self-destructive regressions, simi- lar to the experience of lycanthropy in Kipling' s "The Mark of the  Beast." In Conrad's  oriental tales, the regressions are less severe and  often beneficial, even salvations from the frequently false values of  civilization, as in Lord Jim's version of going native in Patusan. These  regressive patterns involve the perception (quite conscious on Con- rad' s part, probably less so on Kipling' s) of the cold, destructive emp- tiness at the heart of empires both ancient and modern, and of the  secret attractions of decadence and barbarismo  The problems of mass production and of alienated masses were both  reflected in the largerpatterns of European imperialismo Empire and  industry were linked by economic expansion and the competition for  cheap labor, new resources, and new markets. Empire and the  emergence of the masses were linked by the same forces, together  with the population explosion, which seemed to be producing new,  mostly internal "barbarian" hordes and creating pressure for  Lebensraum. The Marxism that accused bourgeois society of dec- adence argued that modern imperialism is the final stage of "monopo- ly" or "late" capitalism, the prelude to the ultimate revolutionary  upheaval. The height of the decadent movement in fin de siecle Eu- rope also saw the zenith of imperialist expansion in the "scramble for  Mrica" and for large parts of Asia; there followed the Spanish-Ameri- can War, the Boer War, the Russo-Japanese War, and World War 1.  </page> <page sequence="29"> Some Nineteenth-Century Themes  Imperialists from Sir John R. Seeley down to Mussolini and Hitler  invoked the glory rather than the decline of Rome. In The Expansion  01 England (1883), Seeley remarks that there is a crucial "difference  between the Roman Empire and other Empires founded on conquest,  [which] arises from the superiority in civilisation of the conquerors to  the conquered."42 Many empires have been forged by barbarian war- lords such as Genghis Khan, but the Roman Empire was the work of a  highly civilized society. "The domination of Rome over the western  races was the empire of civilization over barbarismo Among the Gauls  and Iberians Rome stood as a beacon-light" (192). Seeley believes that  the British Empire embodies the same qualities that had dis- tinguished the Roman, for it too is the bearer of light to the dark  place s of the earth. Nor was the advance in civilization of the subject  peoples the only benefit claimed for empire. As late as 1941, Baron  Hailey could assert that "the privileges which the Roman Empire held  out to its subject peoples were the guarantee of peace, and participa- tion in a system of law," and that along with these boons the British  Empire also offered eventual independence to its colonies. This is  the same as arguing that subjugation now wiH mean freedom later- after the subject peoples have been "improved." Hailey thus ex- pressed the reality of the decline and faH of the British Empire, a fact  by 1941, in the most positive terms possible. 43  In contrast to Hailey, those who defended empire in the second half  of the nineteenth century often did so in improbable Virgilian terms,  as imperium sine fine dedi (empire without end). Of course Rome' s faH  posed difficulties, but these could be offset by arguing that the British  (or French or German) Empire had a moral or divine mission that  would ensure its survival. According to Lord Curzon, empires feH  only when they lost sight of their ideals. If the British maintained their  "faithful attachment to the acquisitions of [their] forefathers," and if  they kept their "national character ... high and undefiled," they  would never experience the fate of lesser empires. 44 Other imperial- ists acknowledged the inevitability of decline and fall, often explaining  42.

From ahout 1870  down to World War 1, social Darwinists like Ernst Haeckel and Karl  Pearson defended empire on the "scientific" grounds of racial superi- ority and "survival of the fittest." Paradoxically, however, racist theo- ries of empire lend themselves more easily to ideas of decadence than  of progress, as in Joseph de Gobineau' s Essai sur l'inégalité des mees  hwnaines (1853). Starting from the assumption of apure race in the  past-"the Aryan myth," fór example-racist theories arrive easily at  the idea of corruption by miscegenation in the presento Unless stan- dards of racial purity can be strictly enfórced, the course of history is  inevitably downward. Commenting O!1 the relation of this pattern to  imperialism, Hannah Arendt quotes Gohineau's first sentence: 'The  faH of civilization is the most striking and, at the same time, the most  obscure of aH phenomena ofhistory." Gobineau, Arendt remarks, was  "fascinated by the faH and hardly interested in the rise of civ- ilizations."4 .5  In what may be the most thorough application of Roman paraHels to  the British Empire, Greater Rome and Greater Britain (1912), Sir  Charles P. Lucas writes:  ~lanual labour among thc Romans was, under the Republie and at  the beginning of the Empire, almost exclusively slave labour. ...  The Roman plebs, who demanded panem et circenses, did not ap- parently consist of wage earners. They wcre rather a privileged class  of unemploycd, who looked to the Statc and to the conquests made  by thc State to keep them fed and amused. This fact, that manual  labour was in the main slave labour, accounts for thc absence of any  definite labour movement 01' labour problems in the Roman  Empire. 46  That modern mass movements like trade unionism, strikes, and social- ism were missing from Roman history, Lucas thinks, makes the Brit- ish record much preferable-labor is now "free" to express itself- though he does not approve of trade unionism, strikes, and socialismo  Perhaps because ofhis conservative attitudes, Lucas is cited by Lenin  45.

"47 But if Lenin disapproved of pro-em- pire Roman analogizing, he was nevertheless influenced by the chief  British opponent of imperialism, J. A. Hobson, though Hobson also  has much to say about Roman parallels: "Whether we regard Imperi- alism [as a general historical pattern] or as confined to the policy of  Great Britain," Hobson writes, "we find much that is closely analo- gous to the Imperialism of Rome."48  Rather than Roman glory, of course, Hobson in Imperialism (1902)  stresses decline and fallo Referring to the wild celebration after one of  the key battles of the Boer War, which he felt had been turned into a  series of "spectacular" events by the sensation-mongering press, Hob- son declares that "panem et circenses interpreted into English means  cheap booze and Mafficking" (101). He adds: "Popular education,  instead of serving as a defense, is an incitement towards Imperialism;  it has opened up a panorama of vulgar pride and crude sensationalism  to a great inert mass who see current history and the tangled maze of  world movements with dim, bewildered eyes, and are the inevitable  dupes of the able organized interests who can lure, or scare, or drive  them into any convenient course." Thus through the press and the  schools the "glories" of empire and of nationalist warfare were helping  to fill in the content of the new, raw, industrialized mass culture,  closing the vicious circle that joins the production of alienated masses  to the pursuit of expansionist foreign policies.  Though Hobson stops short of Marxism, his analysis does not differ  substantially from Lenin's. The two chief economic causes of empire  Hobson sees as underconsumption in home markets and a conspiracy  of big businessmen, bankers, and financiers in search of foreign mar- kets and resources. A similar pattern of "parasitism" or economic  vampirism by a wealthy, nonlaboring class explains the downfall of  47- V. 1.

"This is the largest, plainest instance history presents of the  social parasitic process by which a moneyed interest within the State,  usurping the reins of government, makes for imperial expansion in  order to fasten economic suckers into foreign bodies so as to drain  them of their wealth in order to support domestic luxury" (367). Hob- son adds: "The new Imperialism differs in no vital point from this old  example." Applying social Darwinist metaphors in reverse, he con- eludes: "The laws which, operative throughout nature, doom the par- asite to atrophy, decay, and final extinction, are not evaded by nations  any more than by individual organisms" (367). Hobson is especially  good at demolishing the ideological rationalizations for "parasitism"  provided by social Darwinists such as Karl Pearson: "The notion of the  world as a cock-pit of nations in which round after round shall elimi- nate feebler fighters and leave in the end one nation, the most effi- cient, to lord it on the dung-hill, has no scientific validity. Invoked to  support the elaims of militant nationalism, it begins by ignoring the  very nature and purposes of national life," which are to provide se- curity through cooperation and law and order for individual develop- ment (188-89). The surest way for an empire to fall, says Hobson, is to  nurture "the habit of economic parasitism" manifest in the bread and  circuses syndrome. 49 The inevitable result must be the overwhelming  of the parasitic civilization by the barbarians whom it exeludes  (193-94). Lenin's chief difference from Hobson, whom he considers a  shrewd but incomplete "petit bourgeois" theorist, líes in Lenin's be- lief that it will take much more to stop imperialist expansion than  curing "underconsumption" at home. From Lenin's standpoint, iInpe- rialism is precisely capitalism in the midst of its death throes, from  which there can be no escape.  iv  The controversies over imperialism, socialism, and decadence  formed the intellectual context of the arts and crafts movement associ- ated with William Morris, who combined Marxism with elements of a  decadent romanticismo As Morris's biographer E. P. Thompson notes,  49. Hobson uses the metaphor of the "arena" of competition or conflict throughout  Imperialism to describe social Darwinist doctrine, perhaps echoing Thomas Huxley's  criticism of the "gladiatorial theory of existence" in Evolution and Ethics.  </page> <page sequence="33"> Sorne Nineteenth-Century Thernes 145  imperialism is what "brought him to Socialismo "so Morris' s definition  of imperialism is close to Hobson' s and Lenin's : "It is simply the agony  of capitalism driven by a force it cannot resist to seek for new and ever  new markets at any price and any risk. "SI The rapacity and violence of  imperialism destroys more peaceful, "savage" and "barbarian" social  and cultural patterns throughout the world. The process of exploita- tion turns "fairly happy barbarians into very miserable half-civilized  people surrounded by a fringe of exploiters and middle-men varied in  nation but of one religion-'Take care of Number One'" (384-85).  Morris condemns jingoism and the idea of Britain' s civilizing mission  as sheer hypocrisy. The "barbarians" needing to be "civilized" may be  primitive peoples, but Morris is just as ready to turn the former word  into a charge against his own countrymen: "Strange that the new  Attila, the new Genghis Khan, the modern seo urge of God, should be  destined to stalk through the world in the gentlemanly broadcloth of a  Quaker manufacturer!" (719). Like Marx and Engels before and Lenin  after him, Morris sees imperialism as the last phase of capitalism, its  final desperate search for new sources of profit and new solutions to its  periodic crises. It is a method of imposing "civilization"-that is,  exploitation-at the end of a bayonet, and it is sure to end in a  worldwide "doom of Blood and Iron" (720).  Morris arrived at his Marxist views by an apparently circuitous  path. In common with the romantics and decadents who also deplored  bourgeois industrialism, Morris' s earliest concerns were esthetic, not  political. His intellectual lineage runs back through the Pre-Rapha- elite Brotherhood to the Gothic revival in architecture, which es- pecially through the proselytizing of A. W. N. Pugin pointed the way  to John Ruskin' s theory of Gothic. In his True Principles of Pointed or  Christian Architecture (1841), Pugin rejects industrial techniques al- most wholesale. He cries out against "those inexhaustible mines of  bad taste, Birmingham and Sheffield," and he lambastes modern in- dustrial design generally under the sarcastic epithet "Sheffield eter- nal. "S2 Industrialism is the main antithesis in Pugin' s thinking to the  50. E. P. Thompson, William Morris: Romantic to Revolutionary (New York: Pan- theon, 1977), p. 631.  51.

For Pugin, Gothic  is Christian, and therefore perfect, art and architecture.  Though Ruskin did not fo11ow Pugin to the letter, both Pugin' s  insistence that Gothic is the one true style and his hatred of industrial- ism reappear in Modern Painters (1843-60), The Seven Lamps of  Architecture (1849), and The Stones of Venice (1851-53). In these  works, Ruskin agrees with Pugin that machine production itself is  fraudulent or inauthentic, especia11y when applied to the arts. Here is  Pugin on cast-iron ornamentation, foreshadowing Ruskin: "Cast-iron  is a deception; it is seldom or never left as iron. It is disguised by  paint, either as stone, wood, or marble. This is a mere trick, and the  severity of Christian or Pointed Architecture is utterly opposed to a11  deception" (True Principies, p. 30). Similarly, in Seven Lamps, Ruskin  dedaims against what he ca11s "architectural deceits." There are three  kinds of such fraudulence, the last of which is "operative deceit," by  which he means "the use of cast or machine-made ornaments of any  kind." "There are two reasons, both weighty, against [operative de- ceit]; one, that a11 cast and machine work is had, as work; the other,  that it is dishonest. ".53  In this sort of argument, machine production and the devaluation or  cheapening and democratizing of symhols go hand in hand, as in  Flaubert' s tirade against industrialized life. Pugin and Ruskin point  directly to two of the principal associations of industrialized mass  culture with decadence: handwork is perceived as intrinsica11y more  valuable and "honest" than machine work; and the virtua11y endless  replication and dissemination of objects made possible by machinery  seems to destroy their esthetic value by destroying their economic  value. The latter is not an argument actua11y presented hy Pugin and  Ruskin, though it isimplicit in many of their assertions, as also in the  attacks on machinery and on mass-produced goods made hy Carlyle,  Baudelaire, Flauhert, and many other nineteenth-century inte11ec- tuals and artists. They are especia11y disturbed by what they perceive  as the misuse of machinery to imitate, and consequently cheapen, the  forms of the pasto Pugin and Ruskin themselves, however, seek to  resuscitate these forms in authentic, non industrial ways: not dassical,  53.

Central to Ruskin' s social criticism are his identifications of art with  freedom and of industrial techniques with slavery. Ruskin sees in  machine production a rebirth of the system of "servile ornament" that  characterizes the architecture of the ancient slave civilizations. The  very perfection of antique architecture and sculpture reveals their  roots in slavery. The classical slave laborer could execute only the  finite and therefore perfectible designs imposed upon him by his  masters. "But in the medieval, or especially Christian, system of  ornament, this slavery is done away with altogether; Christianity hav- ing recognized, in small things as well as great, the individual value of  every sou1. ".54 For this reason especially, "Gothic is not only the best,  but the only rational architecture" (X:Z1Z). Unfortunately, history  moved on from the Middle Ages to the corruptions of the Renais- sanee, of whieh the fate of Venice is emblematic; Ruskin invokes  biblical terms in his descriptions of its eclipse: "That aneient curse was  upon her, the curse ofthe Cities ofthe Plain, 'Pride, fulness ofbread,  and abundance of idleness.' By the inner burning ofher own passions,  as fatal as the fiery rain of Gomorrah, she was consumed from her  place among the nations; and her ashes are choking the channels of the  dead, salt sea" (XI: 195). So fell Venice, that focal point of the clash  between barbarism and classical civilization which Ruskin views as  itself a kind of artistic mausoleum "charged with embayed fragments  of the Roman wreck" (IX:38). But the downfall ofVenice is, of course,  not attributable to mechanization; Ruskin thinks it was due rather to  the two apparently opposite eorruptions of secularization and Roman  Catholicism.  For Ruskin the course of both social and cultural history has de- clined from the age of Gothic to the nadir of the industrial present,  with its new system of slavery and esthetic degradation based on  machinery. Ruskin' s powers as a prophet of nearly biblical eloquence  are greatest when he focuses on machinery and its effeets: "Alas! if  read rightly, these [mechanical] perfectnesses are signs of a slavery in  our England a thousand times more bitter and more degrading than  that of the scourged African, or helot Greek" (x: 193). He declares that  54. John Ruskin, The Stones of Venice, Works, x, 189-9°.  </page> <page sequence="36"> BREAD AND CIRCUSES  to purchase and enjoy machine-made artifacts is to perpetuate a sys- tem that degrades "the operative into a machine"; "every young lady,  therefore, who buys glass beads is engaged in the slave-trade" (X: 197).  Once again, what seems to be progress proves to be decadence.  Ruskin sees with great clarity and bitterness how the division of labor  dehumanizes and creates revolutionary discontent: "The great cry  that rises from aH our manufacturing cities, louder than their furnace  blast, is aH in very deed for this,-that we manufacture everything  there except men" (X: 196). Instead of discovering in modern industrial  techniques a new esthetic discipline and a promise of socialliberation,  Ruskin sees in them at best mere utilitarian expediency and at worst a  regression to slavery on the antique model, aH the more apparent  from the very "perfectness" of mass-produced artifacts. Perfection  means the substitution of mechanical for spiritual ends; it is always a  symptom of slavery, whether ancient or moderno The exactness of  execution of Greek architecture, Ruskin thinks, is a symptom of the  "degradation" of the workman: Egyptian or Ninevite work is freer,  but medieval work is the only truly free work of the past. Because  "there is perpetual change both in design and in execution" in Gothic  architecture, "the workman must be altogether set free" (X:204-S).  Of course such a diagnostic method is much too simplistic; Ruskin's  claim that the Greek worker was less free than the Egyptian or the  Ninevite is nonsense. But Ruskin points ahead to arguments like those  in Oswald Spengler's Man and Technics (1931) and Friedrich Jünger's  The Failure of Technology (1949), where the antithesis between art  and machinery, genuine culture and anything mass-produced, is  maintained just as rigidly as in The Stones of Venice. 55 And Roman  55. Both Spengler's and Jünger's essays offer versions of negative classicism. Like  Volney musing upon the ruin s of the past, the prophets of the demise of machine  civilization muse upon the ruin s of the future. "The earth-spanning power of technol- ogy is of an ephemeral kind," writes Jünger. "Everywhere it is threatened by decay,  given over to decay, and decay follows upon its heels all the more insistently and  closely, the faster it marches on towards new triumphs" (The Failure of Technology  [Chicago: Henry Regnery, 1956 (1949)], pp. 26-27). Jünger thinks that, though "the  technical organization ofImperial Rome cannot be compared to ours, ... imperialism  and the formation of the masses go hand in hand," and he invokes "bread and circuses"  to prove his point (pp. 158-60). Similarly, Spengler decries the subversion of spir- ituality, art, and culture by the utilitarian and industrial partly in these terms: "Jt is the  panem et circenses of the giant city of the late periods that is presenting itself" (Man  and Technics, tr. Charles Atkinson [London: George Allen and Unwin, 1932 (1931)],  p.6).  </page> <page sequence="37"> Some Nineteenth-Century Themes 149  analogies are never far from his thinking, just as they form an impor- tant element in the anti-industrial theories of the esthetic decadents  and of both the right and the left today:  Now, you are to remember that all these vilenesses had taken pos- session of the civilized world under the Roman Empire, just as they  have done at this present time. The forms of Scorn, Disobedience,  Cowardice, Lust, and Infidelity correspond in the c10sest manner, in  the temper of the Romans in their last decline, with those man- ifested among ourselves at this day; what cure may be done on  ourselves remains for us and our children to feel, and already it is  becoming sharp. [XX:3S8]  As a Gothicist rather than a Hellenic classicist, Ruskin, like Thomas  Carlyle before him, sees a possible salvation for corrupt civilization in  a return of the barbarians, for "the cure of the Roman degeneracy was  in the descent upon them of the Northern tribes, some to slay and  so me to govern, some to reinhabit; all of them alike gifted with a new  terrific force of will and passion, and a fertility of savage blood which  was again to give ltaly suck from the teat of the wolf" (XX:3S8-S9)'  In The House of the Wolfings (1888), Ruskin's disciple William  Morris portrays a courageous barbarian tribe defending its forest  homeland against the rapacious tyranny of Rome. "Now the name of  this House was the Wolfings, and they bore a Wolf on their banners,  and their warriors were marked on the breast with the image of the  Wolf, that they might be known for what they were if they fell in  battle."·56 Morris perhaps has in mind the triumph of Hermann over  the Roman army in the Battle ofTeutoberger Forest, an event dear to  the hearts of German volkísch nationalists from Friedrich Jahn  through Richard Wagner down to the Nazis, and celebrated in that  nineteenth-century bestseller Felix Dahn's Kampf um Rom (1867).  Certain it is that Morris' s version of the Gothic revival often goes  beyond the polite if vaguely decadent re-creations of Dante, Chaucer,  and Arthurian legend associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood  and with much ofhis own artwork. In Sigurd the Volsung, The House  of the W olfings, The Roots of the M ountains, and his Icelandic transla- tions, Morris seeks to re-create barbarian vigor and freedom and to  uphold barbarism at least by analogy as an alternative to "this filth of  56. William Morris, The House ofthe Wolfings, in Collected Works, 24 vols., ed.  May Morris (London: Longmans, Creen, 1912), XIV, 5.  </page> <page sequence="38"> BREAD AND CIRCUSES  civilization." And throughout Morris' s writings, the Romans "are a  most evil folk," as a Wolfing warrior puts it (46).  According to Carl Schorske, "Wagner and Morris both quested for  the future in the relics of the past. ".57 Though The House of the  Wolfings and his other Teutonic romances are Wagnerian botb in  their operatic qualities and in their celebration of antique, mythic  virtues, Morris is not inventing or echoing a racist version of history.  For him, the analogy is not between barbarism and Aryan racial supe- riority, but between barbarism and the industrial proletariat. And  Rome for Morris is not parallel to a decadent because racially impure  Europe as it had been for Gobineau; Rome is instead parallel to the  tyranny of industrial capitalism and modern imperialism. 5S Like Rus- kin and Carlyle, Morris interprets the overthrow of Rome by the  barbarians as a necessary purgation and renewal of a decadent world  ("and so Rome feH and Europe rose, and the hope of the world was  born again"); it is this interpretation that underlies The House of the  Wolfings. In contrast to most late nineteenth-century fictional ac- counts of the triumph of barbarism and religion over the Roman Em- pire-Quo Vadis (1897) and Ben-Hur (1899), for example-Morris  ignores religion and sentimentalizes barbarism instead. Therefore, "to  those that have hearts to understand," the fall of Rome "is a parable oi'  the days to come; of the change in store for us hidden in the breast of  the Barbarism of civilisation-the Proletariat. "59  The great, heroic, bloody war waged by the Wolfings against the  Romans, mirroring a dim, precivilized, preimperialized past, is one of  Morris' s many adumbrations of the longed-for revolution, the es- chatological Judgment Day battle or Ragnarok of the communist fu- ture. AH of Morris' s art, even when it seems most vapidly escapist,  involves a search fór what is least civilized, most vigorously primitive,  or at any rate most distant from or defiant of modern industrial and  imperialist society. His is a utopian primitivism that seeks to tran- scend the features ofboth positive and negative classicism, but that in  doing so itself acquires the features of decadent escapism.  57.

"61 Given this twin  motivation, Morris' s Pre-Raphaelitism, his Icelandic translations, his  prose romances and fantasies, and his work in the anti-industrial arts  and crafts movement, of which he was a founder and leader, can aH be  seen as consistent with his esthetic version of Marxism. As does Marx,  however, Morris holds an ambivalent attitude toward machinery-an  attitude more ambivalent than many of his anti-industrial and anti- bourgeois pronouncements suggest. Machinery for Morris promises  freedom and leisure, even though under capitalism it only adds to the  oppression of the masses. 62 Machine technology has a shadowy role to  play even in the pastoral utopia of News ¡rom Nowhere, which Morris  wrote in conscious opposition to the industrial regimentation idealized  by Edward BeHamy in Looking Backward. It appeared to Morris that  machinery could help people achieve the utopia of popular art by  shortening labor time, but he did not see-as do Lewis Mumford and  Susan Sontag, for example-an esthetic potential in machinery  itself. 63  The arts and crafts movement, however, was deliberately anti- mechanistic, setting handcrafted artifacts in contrast to machine-made  goods. Its ultimate goal was to transform aH workers into artists and aH  labor into esthetically pleasing experience. Like Ruskin, Morris iden- tifies freedom with esthetic fulfillment; the utopia that ought to foHow  the coming revolution would mean the reign of "popular art," by  60.

The exploration of the impersonal (and trans-personal) in  contemporary art is the new classicism."  </page> <page sequence="40"> BREAD AND CIRCUSES  which Morris means something like mass culture humanized or de- reified. To a defender of technical expertise and "the instinct of work- manship" like Thorstein Veblen, the arts and crafts movement looked  silly and sentimental. The "visible imperfections" of "handwrought  goods" are considered "honorific," Veblen writes, at least according to  the "barbarian" scale of values of "the leisure class." Ruskin and  Morris have exalted "the defective" and defended "crudity and  wasted efI"ort."64 Veblen detects in the arts and crafts movement ele- ments of snobbery that would hardly seem to fit such a dedicated  socialist as Morris, were it not for the fact that Morris himself criticizes  his esthetic endeavors on the grounds of their elitist nature. "What  business have we to do with art unless all can share it?"65 Sharing  many of the values of the esthetic decadents, Morris stands their  antidemocratic attitudes upside down and arrives at the ideal of the  complete democratization of the arts. He wanted to be an artist for the  masses, but he knew he was an artist only for the few, and he thought  this would always be the case under capitalismo Given this theoretical  predicament, even his praise of barbarism looks like the last refine- ment of a decadent age, the longing for a rejuvenation that seems both  impossibly remote and historically inevitable, close at hand.  In The Pilgrims of Hope, like Germinal published in 1885, Morris  interprets the Paris Commune in Marxist terms as a tragic defeat for  the revolution. The crushing of the Commune was the apotheosis of  the tyranny of industrial capitalism over the enslaved masses. But the  revolution would come, even against the war machine of the bour- geoisie, which in Morris's poem mows down the heroic workers. The  sunrise for both Marx and Morris, as also for Etienne Lantier, would  be bloodred. After the W olfings and their Gothic allies have beaten  back the Romans in one of their engagements, Morris' s noble barbar- ians sing their victory song:  Now hearken and hear  Of the day-dawn of fear,  And how up rose the sun  64.

All night lay a-hiding,  Our anger abiding,  Dark down in the wood  The sharp seekers of blood.  Like the Wolfings' weapons ("sharp seekers ofblood"), the machinery  ofWestern civilization, based on capitalist wage slavery and the com- petition for empire, has produced more than one sort of Gothic revival  in the twentieth century.  "In my country there are no gods left," says the Cappodocian in  Osear Wilde's Salomé. "The Romans have driven them out." For the  decadent writers and artists of the nineteenth century, the imperial  powers-that-be had also driven out art, the possibility of the beautiful,  and genuine culture, replacing them with the sham goods of indus- trialized mass culture. For Marxists and radicals like Morris, the  charges against "the Romans" went further: their form of civilization  meant slavery, their vaunted progress was nothing more than an un- mitigated catastrophe. Perhaps it would make sense to speak of "dec- adence" wherever the longing for "barbarism" arises, and vice versa.  In an essay on "barbarism" and "decadence" in the work of three  modernist poets (C. P. Cavafy, Valery Bryusov, and W. B. Yeats),  Renato Poggioli contends that these concepts have an affinity for each  other. He suggests that they are sadomasochistic antonyms which  imply the goals of an exhausted civilization, a civilization that yearns  for endings, for destruction and peace, for suicide and new life. "Dec- adence may well be another name for civilization' s self-betrayal," says  Poggioli, "a truth more or less knowingly reflected in many literary  documents of our time. "66 Morris and Wilde would have agreed with  this assessment; so would Verlaine, whose self-identification with dec- adence ineludes a glowing report on the barbarians:  Je suis J'Empire a la fin de la décadence,  Qui regarde passer les grands Barbares blancs. 67  66.
