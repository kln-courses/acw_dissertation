<plain_text><page sequence="1">T. W. Adorno And The Dilemma of Bourgeois Philosophy BY SUSAN F. BUCK-MORSS I. The Concrete Particular Philosophy, in view of the present historical situation, has its true interest where Hegel, at one with tradition, registered his disinterest: with the non-conceptual, the singular and the particular; with that which since Plato has been dismissed as transitory and insignificant, and upon which Hegel hung the label of "lazy existence." 1 If, in his inaugural address, Adorno was not yet attempting a systematic eduction of a materialist logic out of the ruins of idealism, he nonetheless made it clear that the problem of "Die Aktualität der Philosophie" could not be detached from the history of philosophy. He began by summarizing briefly the problems encountered by current philosophic schools, and concluded: I have discussed the most recent history of philosophy not for a general intellectual history {geisteswissenschaftliche) orientation, but because only out of the historical entanglement of questions and answers does the question of philosophy's actuality emerge precisely. 2 Adorno's point was that his program for "the dissolution of that which has long been termed philosophy"3 (i.e., bourgeois idealism) was not an arbitrary choice of subjective fancy, but that it emerged out of the "demands of the philosophic material in its present stage of development." "Actuality" meant: 1 Adorno, Negative Dialektik, pp. 17-18 (trans, mine). 2 Adorno, "Die Aktualität der Philosophie" (1931), G S 1, p. 331. 3 Adorno, "Die Aktualität der Philosophie" (1931), GS 1, p. 339.</page><page sequence="2">T.

The question is in no way rhetorical, but should be taken very literally. Every philosophy which today does not depend on the security of current intellectual and social conditions, but instead upon truth, sees itself facing the problem of a liquidation of philosophy.4 Adorno used terms of natural decay in his speech to describe idealist concepts and tenets of philosophy, treating them like material objects with a life and a death of their own, and thereby conveying their historical character, that is, their transit or iness.5 He argued, in critical reference to Heidegger's then-popular ontology of Being6: "The idea of 4 Ibid., p. 331. Cf.: "Its [philosophy's] task would be to inquire whether and how there can still be a philosophy at all, now that Hegel's has fallen. . . ." (Adorno, Negative Dialectics, p. 4.) 5 Cf. Chapter III. In Negative Dialectics, Adorno expressed the same notion of the historical obsolescence of philosophic phenomena, but his metaphor was socially more concrete than the image of organic nature: "The introverted thought architect dwells behind the moon that is taken over by extroverted technicians. The conceptual shells that were to house the whole, according to philosophic custom, have in view of the immense expansion of society and of the strides made by positive natural science come to seem like relics of a simple barter economy amidst the late stage of industrial capitalism." {Ibid., p. 3.) 6 Adorno's inaugural address can be interpreted as a counter-program to Heidegger's whose Sein und Zeit, published in 1927, was extremely influential within faculty circles at the Frankfurt university. Indeed, the entire corpus of Adorno's writings can be read fruitfully as a critical response to Heidegger, all the more effective, the more unspoken his intent and indirect his attack. (Hence, Adorno's book expressly devoted to attacking Heidegger, Jargon der Eigentlichkeit (1964), is one of his least satisfying compared, for example, to his study of Kierkegaard ( 1 933) which challenges Heidegger indirectly by challenging his existentialist heritage.) A detailed comparison of Adorno and Heidegger awaits a competent scholar. We can here only suggest points at which their thought converged (although in non-identical configurations). Like Adorno, Heidegger was convinced that present philosophers had to radically rethink the fundamentals of their discipline. But to Heidegger this meant establishing a new ontology of man's existence, whereas Adorno, criticizing the ideological affirmation of the social status quo inherent in all ontology, saw "radical" philosophy in terms of the critical negation of the existing idealism. Against the ontological categories of "Being," "thrownness," and "historicity," Adorno insisted on the historical specificity of men's (not "man's") condition. Both were strongly influenced by Husserl, both agreed that subject and object were necessarily related (Husserl had argued that thought was always thought-of-something, and Adorno agreed, while Heidegger spoke in terms of man's Being {Dasein) as always being-in-the-world); but Heidegger simply posited this relation as immediately given in experience, while Adorno demonstrated their mediated relationship through the experience of dialectical argumentation. Both wanted to establish a concrete, "materialist" analysis of phenomena, a</page><page sequence="3">78 SUSAN F. BUCK-MORSS being has grown feeble in philosophy; it is not more than an empty formal principle whose archaic value helps to adorn any contents whatever."7 And he used language decay to describe what he saw as the crux of philosophy's present difficulties, the dissolution of the premise of identity between subject and object, considered by bourgeois idealism to be the prerequisite for knowledge of truth which, it assumed, was necessarily both absolute and total: "The adequacy of thought and being as totality . . . has decomposed. . . ."8 The autonome ratio - that was the thesis of all idealist systems - was supposed to be capable of developing the concept of reality, and all reality, from out of itself. This thesis has disintegrated.9 Horkheimer, in the more pedestrian, less metaphoric language of Ideologiekritik, described the death of the identity principle upon which bourgeois metaphysics had been founded in terms of a change in the social relations of production: The idea of unbroken harmony between reality and reason belongs to the liberalist phase. It corresponds to a social economy marked by a plurality of individual entrepreneurs. 10 The correspondence had historical validity. The building of great metaphysical systems did in fact coincide with the pre-1848 period of bourgeois liberalism, before the events of that year placed the bourgeoisie on the defensive. No longer advocates of revolution, they phenomenological hermeneutics of the profane world, but to Heidegger this meant unveiling a general, "essential" truth out of the particulars of man's lived existence, whereas Adorno wanted to expose within the particular the general structure of a historically developed society. "Materialist" to Heidegger meant relating particulars to the ontological categories of Being; to Adorno it meant relating them to Marxian categories of society. Heidegger internalized the Hegelian dialectic of Being and non- Being, conceiving it in terms of man's being-to-death, while Adorno saw it in terms of the relationship between subject and object. Both men were critics of mass culture and technological society. But Heidegger saw the Angst which men suffered as an existential, ontological condition, demanding that man transform himself; Adorno insisted on the transformation of society. As the latter wrote Benjamin, "The goal of the revolution is the elimination of anxiety {Angst)" (letter, Adorno to Benjamin, 18 March 1936, in Adorno, Ueber Walter Benjamin, p. 132.) Indeed, the fact that Heidegger could endorse the young Marx's treatment of alienation (see Heidegger's "Letter on Humanism," 1947) was reason enough for Adorno's suspicion of Marxist humanism. 7 Adorno, "Die Aktualität der Philosophie" (1931), GS 1, p. 325. « wia. 9 ibid., p. 326. 10 Horkheimer, "Materialism and Metaphysics" (1933), Critical Theory, p. 12.</page><page sequence="4">T.

Since the 1860's, the slogan "Back to Kant" 1 1 articulated the disillusionment among philosophers with all metaphysics. Yet Neo-Kantianism, the product of new historical conditions, never really did go "back." Whereas Kant's critique of metaphysics had been radical in its social implications, these new Kantians turned critical reason into an ideology of resignation, a positivism that was really defeatism, the passive acceptance of the world in its given form. According to Adorno, concurrent with the growing "crisis of idealism" the "given" world of the bourgeois social order became increasingly difficult to justify. 12 As reason and reality lost touch with each other outside of philosophy, they lost touch within philosophy as well, and the relationship of subject and object became the most urgent technical problem confronting modern philosophy, threatening, in fact, its very existence. Adorno claimed that no matter what their class allegiance, philosophers could not avoid acknowledging this problem if they heeded the philosophic material itself,13 even if their adherence to idealist premises prevented them from resolving the issue. For it didn't occur to them that the subject-object relationship could be philosophically grounded in the very non-identity which appeared so problematic. Contemporary bourgeois philosophers felt instead compelled to opt for either (formal, absolute) reason or (historical, relative) reality as the foundation of theory. On the one hand, the Marburg Neo-Kantians held on to the idealist concept of Reason as universal, but paid dearly for this by sacrificing (historical and social) content: [The Marburg School] renounces every right over reality and withdraws into a formal region in which every determination of content is condemned to virtually the farthest point of an unending process.14 11 The phrase was first used by Otto Liebmann in 1865. 12 Lukács had already brought this idea into connection with the theme of decay in History and Class Consciousness. He wrote with reference to the "crisis in culture": "This ideological crisis is an unfailing sign of decay. The bourgeoisie has already been thrown on the defensive; however aggressive its weapons may be, it is fighting for self- preservation. Its power to dominate has vanished beyond recall." (Georg Lukács, History and Class Consciousness, trans. Rodney Livingstone [Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1971], p. 67.) 13 "... for the truth content of a problem is in principle different from the historical and psychological conditions out of which it grows." (Adorno, "Die Aktualität der Philosophie" [1931], GS 1, p. 337.) Hence Ideologiekritik was only the impetus of philosophic criticism and not its culmination. 14 Ibid., p. 326.</page><page sequence="5">80 SUSAN F. BUCK-MORSS At the opposite pole, Lebensphilosophie, by accepting the historical relativity of truth, as well as the necessity of philosophy's dealing with empirical content (lived experience), . . .has admittedly maintained contact with reality, but in so doing has lost every claim to make sense out of the empirical world which presses in upon it. . . .15 Edmund Husserl, whom Adorno considered the most progressive of current bourgeois philosophers, tried to hold onto both Reason and reality. Phenomenology was a stubborn attempt to reach knowledge of the object, the "things themselves" ("zw den Sachen" was HusserFs slogan) without letting go of the traditional idealist concept of Reason as universal and absolute. 16 Husserl failed, but according to Adorno, his failure was precisely his success, for it brought the dilemmas and inner antagonisms of idealist philosophy to their fullest articulation.17 Protesting abstract formalism, Husserl maintained that knowledge was always knowledge of something, yet at the same time he shied away from empirical existence because, as transient and contingent, it could not afford a base for absolute knowledge. He therefore tried to distinguish between the material, "natural" object and its presence within thought, hoping to establish a transcendental realm of thought-objects which could be analysed by pure logic uncontaminated by empirical heterogeneity. He used the following example : When I think of the apple tree in the garden, the object of my thought, while particular, is not the same as the actual, "natural" tree. The latter can be "bracketed out" in phenomenological analysis, because even if it burns up, the "meaning" of the tree remains as the "intention" of my thinking act. 18 Adorno had already protested against this distinction in his thesis for Cornelius in 1924, arguing the empiricist position that the fact that the real tree could burn was precisely the point - "particular things can burn up"19: the meaning of the tree, the truth that it could change, resided in just that heterogeneity which Husserl had tried to eliminate. It is important to realize that what was being debated as a philosophic problem was of more than scholastic concern. At stake was the very 15 Ibid. 16 As Adorno described it in Negative Dialektik, paraphrasing the English adage, Husserl "wanted to eat his cake and have it too."

For if reality could not be brought into identity with universal, rational concepts, as idealists since Kant had claimed, then it threatened to splinter into a profusion of particulars which confronted men and women as opaque and inexplicable. These intractable, ineluctable "things," which Hegel, from the macroscopic perspective of a rational totality, had been able to dismiss as "lazy existence," suddenly lost their easy familiarity and loomed upon the human horizon as alien and threatening, the source of overwhelming anxiety. Testifying to the historical specificity of this experience of anxiety was its frequent recurrence as a theme in the literature of the twenties and thirties.20 It was perhaps nowhere more vividly expressed than in Jean-Paul Sartre's novel Nausea (1938). His description of a chestnut tree in the park (it might just as well have been in Husserl's garden), which he experienced as a totally "unintentional" object, with none of its material contingency bracketed out, merits quoting: The roots of the chestnut tree were sunk in the ground just under my bench. I couldn't remember it was a root any more. The words had vanished and with them the significance of things, their methods of use, and the feeble points of reference which men have traced in their surface. I was sitting, stooping forward, head bowed, alone in front of this black, knotty mass, entirely beastly, which frightened me. . . . And then all of a sudden, there it was, clear as day: existence had suddenly unveiled itself. It had lost the harmless look of an abstract category: it was the very paste of things, this root was kneaded into existence. . . . All these objects * how can I explain? They inconvenienced me; I would have liked them to exist less strongly, more dryly, in a more abstract way, with more reserve. The chestnut tree pressed itself against my eyes. . . . In the way: it was the only relationship I could establish between these trees, these gates, these stones. In vain I tried to count the chestnut trees, to locate them by their relationship to the Velleda, to compare their height with the height of the plane trees: each of them escaped the relationship in which I tried to enclose it, isolated itself, and overflowed.21 Adorno, whose high regard for Sartre the artist was not extended to 20 It is perhaps significant that what Kant had called the "scandal" instigated by Hume's attack on reason did not evoke a similar Angst as did the threat to reason of the early twentieth century. *Ellipsis, Sartre's. 21 Jean-Paul Sartre, Nausea, trans.

BUCK-MORSS Sartre the philosopher,22 might have recognized the validity of this description, but not the philosophic conclusions which Sartre drew from it. The latter argued that the impossibility of subsuming particular phenomena under general, abstract categories was proof that existence was absurd.23 To Adorno it proved only the absurdity of the whole classificatory process, and the equation of such pidgeon-holing with knowledge. In his 1931 speech he stated: If philosophy must learn to renounce the question of totality, then it implies that it must learn to do without the symbolic function, in which for a long time, at least in idealism, the particular appeared to represent the general. . . .24 This philosophic mandate was in agreement with Sartre's experiential observation. But where Adorno felt existentialism (as well as phenomenology and Lebensphilosophie) made its mistake was in accepting "natural" phenomena as "given" immediately in experience. Hegel had already demonstrated the illusory nature of such attempts at "concreteness" in the opening pages of The Phenomenology of Mind, arguing that the immediately given "this," "here" was in fact the most abstract. Adorno made use of Hegel's argument (although he couched it in the language of Walter Benjamin) in his critique of the founder of modern existentialism, Soren Kierkegaard: It may be said that abstraction is the seal of mythical thinking. The ambiguity of the guilty connection with nature, whereby everything communicates with everything without differentiation, knows no true concretion. Here the name of the created things are confused, and in their place remains the blind matter or the empty sign. The wide-spread custom of ascribing to mythic - archaic - thought the highest degree of concreteness, due to the conceptually immediate perception of the "this-here," leads to error.25 22 "[Sartre's] plays disavow the philosophy with whose theses they deal." (Adorno, Negative Dialectics, p. 50.) 23 "The word absurdity is coming to life under my pen. . . .And without formulating anything clearly, I understood that I had found the key to Existence, the key to my Nauseas, to my own life. In fact, all that I could grasp beyond that returns to this fundamental absurdity [T] he world of explanations and reasons is not the world of existence. A circle is not absurd, it is clearly explained by the rotation of a straight segment around one of its extremities. But neither does a circle exist. This root, on the other hand, existed in such a way that I could not explain it. "(Sartre, Nausea, p. 129.) 24 Adorno, "Die Aktualität der Philosophie" (1931), GS 1, p. 336. 25 Theodor W.

Adorno and the Dilemma of Bourgeois Philosophy 83 For Adorno, "concreteness" necessitated grounding the particular in its dialectical, mediated relationship to the totality. The object was thus more than itself, and knowledge of it was more than the tautological A- A. But only by the mediation of conceptual reflection could this relationship be understood, precisely because it was not immediately "given" in experience. Of course, the "totality" which Adorno had in mind was not that of Hegel's closed metaphysical system, but the Marxian meaning of the total socio-economic structure of relations which characterized the bourgeois order.26 Abstracted from this whole, looked at as an isolated, "natural" entity, the object "congeals. . . into a fetish which merely encloses itself all the more deeply within its existence."27 The fallacy of existentialism and (Husserl's)28 phenomenology was that by stopping with the immediately given object, they did not see past this fetish-like appearance, whose reified form Lukács had analysed as "second nature."29 (Both Sartre's and Husserl's blindness to the social nature of objects was clear from the start in their very choice of a tree, a "first nature" object, to illustrate the essence of the cognitive problematic.) But (as might be anticipated with Adorno's penchant for juxtaposing opposite positions) there was another side of the issue as well. If the existentialist view needed the corrective of dialectical mediation, then dialectics, in turn, in abandoning closed, metaphysical systems, needed to confront the particular phenomena of everyday life, Hegel's "lazy existence," to which Lebensphilosophie and existentialism had justly drawn philosophic attention. Wrote Adorno, philosophy . . .cannot commit itself to the big questions, the size of which once 26 "For Hegel, the totality was the totality of reason, a closed ontological system, finally identical with the rational system of history. Hegel's dialectical process was thus a universal ontological one in which history was patterned on the metaphysical process of being. Marx, on the other hand, detached dialectic from this ontological base. . . . The totality that the Marxian dialectic gets to is the totality of class society, and the negativity that underlies its contradictions and shapes its every content is the negativity of class relations." (Herbert Marcuse, Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory 2nd ed., enl., [New York: The Humanities Press, 1954], p. 314.) 27 Adorno, Kierkegaard (1933), p. 142. 28 Heidegger's phenomenological approach was to simply ignore the fetish character of objects as commodities. He spoke of things as if their use value was still intact, rather than, as Marx (and Adorno) insisted, having been superceded by the abstract, exchange value characteristic of bourgeois commodities. (See Martin Heidegger, Sein und Zeit [1927], 9th ed., unchanged [Tubingen: Niemeyer Verlag, 1960], pp. 68-69. 29 See Chapter III of my forthcoming book on Adorno.</page><page sequence="9">84 SUSAN F. BUCK-MORSS hoped to guarantee the totality, whereas today between the wide meshes of the big questions, interpretation slips away.30 What distinguished Adorno's approach was not only his assertion of the dialectical relation between the particular and the general, but also the direction in which his thought moved in the process of dialectical cognition. Instead of proceeding outward from the particular to the totality (as had Hegel), Adorno moved inward, finding the general within the particular, and indeed, within the "atypical," the insignificant, the extreme. At the crossroads of two seemingly contradictory positions, insisting on the dialectical relationship of the phenomenon to the totality and, at the same time, on the necessity for microcosmic analysis, Adorno grounded his concept of the "concrete particular." There can be no doubt that it was Walter Benjamin who convinced Adorno of the validity of this approach. Although the rejection of wholistic theories and respect for the individual and particular was a common theme among the diverse early influences on Adorno,31 no one, in his opinion, had made this concern more methodologically fruitful than Benjamin. All those who knew Benjamin were impressed by his acute sensitivity for the "minutiae," (das Kleinste), the seemingly insignificant detail. Ernst Bloch wrote: 30 Adorno, "Die Aktualität der Philosophie" (1931), GS 1, p. 336. Cf: "The objective worth of those themes [of Western metaphysics] is indeed inescapable in philosophy, but neither can we rely on our ability to cope with the great topics. We must be so wary of the beaten tracks of philosophical reflection that our emphatic interest will seek refuge in ephemeral objects not yet overdetermined by intentions." (Adorno, Negative Dialectics, p. 17) 3 1 Cornelius had argued that the phenomena could never be entirely known but remained "always partly alien to us." (Hans Cornelius, Grundlagen der Erkenntnistheorie: Transcendentale Systematik, 2nd. ed. [Munich: Ernst Reinhardt, 1926], p. 261. Cf.: "No object is wholly known. . . ." [Adorno, Negative Dialectics, p. 14].) Ernst Simmel, comparing philosophy to Einstein's new physics, observed: "The totality of truth is perhaps as little true as the totality of matter is heavy." ("Ausspruche" of Simmel, collected by Ernst Bloch, Buch des Dankes an Georg Simmel, ed. Kurt Gassen and Michael Landmann [Berlin: Duncker und Humblot, 1958], p. 251. Cf.: "The totality is the untrue." [Theodor W. Adorno, Minima Moralia (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1969), p. 57].) Arnold Schonberg, arguing against theoretical systems of composition, wrote: ". . .laws of nature know no exceptions: theories of art are founded above all on exceptions." (Arnold Schonberg, Harmonielehre [Vienna: Universal- Edition, 1922], p. 6.) Horkheimer's rejection of Hegel's identity of history and Truth because of the suffering of particular individuals has already been discussed in Chapter 111 of my book.</page><page sequence="10">T. W. Adorno and the Dilemma of Bourgeois Philosophy 85 Benjamin had something, which Lukács so frightfully lacked;32 he had an extraordinary eye. . . for the unusual and unschematic, the disruptive, individual being (Einzelsein) which doesn't fit into the mold 33 Benjamin's "microscopic gaze," as Adorno often called it, through which the most common objects appeared remarkable, was a uniquely personal characteristic, but it was more. As a tool for philosophic cognition, it provided a means for making the very particularity of the object release a significance which dissolved its reified appearance and revealed it to be more than a mere tautology, more than simply identical with itself. At the same time, the knowledge it released remained bound to the particular, rather than sacrificing material specificity by moving to a level of abstract, ahistorical generalization.34 In order to clarify precisely what was unique about Benjamin's approach, it will be helpful to draw a comparison. In his inaugural address, Adorno made critical reference to Georg Simmel because of the "irrationalistic" and "psychologistic" orientation of his Lebensphilosophie.15 Yet on several other occasions, he acknowledged Simmel as a precursor of his own intellectual circle.36 Significantly, Simmel also focussed his analytic eye on particular phenomena, and 32 When Lukács analysed the structure of bourgeois theory and found within it the commodity-structure of the social totality, he provided the model for Adorno's own efforts to find the general within the particular; but the difference lay precisely here, in Lukács' impatience with details and his unmistakable preference for totalistic vision. Cf., e.g., his statement: "The greater the distance from pure immediacy [,] the larger the net encompassing the 'relations,' and the more complete the integration of the 'objects' within the system of relations, the sooner change will cease to be impenetrable and catastrophic, the sooner it will become comprehensible. "(Lukács, History and Class Consciousness, p. 154.) 33 Ernst Bloch, "Erinnerung," in Theodor W. Adorno et al., Heber Walter Benjamin (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1968), p. 17. Bloch recalled: "He was capable of asking something like this - it was the first question he posed to my then- fiancee - we saw him wistful, so to say, on the Kurfurstendamm [in Berlin] - wandering with lowered head - and she, the then-fiancee Karola, who was seeing him for the first time, and had heard through me so much about him, she asked him what he was thinking about and he answered: 'My dear, has the sickly appearance of Marzipan figures ever occurred to you?'" {Ibid., p. 18.) 34 Cf.: "We are not to philosophize about concrete things; we are to philosophize, rather, out of these things." (Adorno, Negative Dialectics, p. 33.) 35 Adorno, "Die Aktualität der Philosophie" (1931), GS 1, p. 326. 36 Ernst Bloch knew Simmel personally and provided a sympathetic channel through which Adorno was exposed to his thought. Adorno recognized his debt to Simmel in a lecture delivered in New York, 19 April 1940. (Theodor W. Adorno, "Ueber das Problem der individuellen Kausalität bei Simmel" [Frankfurt am Main: Adorno Estate, unpubl,.]) See also Idem, Negative Dialectics, p. 13; also the essay cited in the following footnote.</page><page sequence="11">86 SUSAN F. BUCK-MORSS also had a gift for interpreting the minutiae of existence.37 Lukács, who had studied with Simmel in Berlin before the war, described his former teacher by referring to . . .the lightening-like grasp and the strikingly meaningful expressions of as yet undiscovered philosophic evidence, the ability to view the smallest and most inessential appearances of everyday life so intensively sub specie philosophae, that they become transparent, revealing behind their transparency a relational pattern of eternal philosophic meaning.38 The above description is remarkably similar to Bloch's of Benjamin, except for the word "eternal." That this one exception, however, provides the key to the critical difference in their respective methods of dealing with the "particular," is apparent in the following illustration. Simmel's short essay, "Sociology of mealtime," was an interpretation of this common human activity inspired by an insight into the essential paradox of meals: what all men shared in common, "that they must eat and drink," was at the same time the most individualistic, ego-centered activity: [W]hat I think I can let others know, what I see I can let them see, what I speak can be heard by hundreds - but what the individual person eats can under no circumstances be eaten by another.39 Precisely this fact, he argued, provided the key to interpreting the social rituals surrounding meals. Regularity of time and place, the use of 37 "Georg Simmel. . .was surely the first, despite all his psychological idealism, to accomplish that return to concrete objects. . . .If at one time our reaction against Simmel was especially strong, then only because that with which he enticed us with the one hand, he held back from us with the other."(Theodor W. Adorno, "Henkel, Krug and frühe Erfahrung," Ernst Block zu Ehren: Beitrage zu seinem Werk, ed. S. Unsels [Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1966], pp. 11-12. On another occasion Adorno noted that Benjamin's efforts were related to Simmel's: ". . . to lead philosophy out of the 'ice-deserts of abstraction' and to bring thoughts into concrete historical images." (Adorno, Ueber Walter Benjamin, p. 38.) 38 Georg Lukács, "Georg Simmel," orginally published in Pester Lloyd, October 2, 1918, reprinted in Buch des Dankes an Georg Simmel, p. 172. In Lukács' pre-Marxist book of essays, Die Seelen und die Formen (Berlin: Ego Fleischel &amp; Co., 1911), some of this same concern for particularity was evident, but later, under the influence of Hegel, Lukács' thinking took on a wholistic orientation. In other ways, however, Lukács remained indebted to Simmel. For example, it was Simmel who deplored the ossified cultural forms and saw them as the source of modern man's alienation, the same position which underlay Lukács' concept of "second nature." 39 Georg Simmel, "Soziologie der Mahlzeit, "Bruche und Tür (Stuttgart: K.

Benjamin was able to educe a meaning which was more than tautological, which transcended the immediately "given" objects without transcending their particularity. The uncleared dinner table does not bear witness to some general principle concerning the nature of society; but it might indeed reveal the nature of that particular society whose members have left their traces behind them in the dining room.45 40 Ibid., pp. 245-50. 41 Walter Benjamin, "Einbahnstrasse" (1928), Gesammelte Schriften, eds.

In 1934 he published a book of aphorisms which also interpreted the social significance of everyday phenomena. One aphorism criticized the pseudo-fraternal spirit of New Year's Eve parties at hotels or nightclubs, which made it appear that "the differences between people, above all between poor and rich, are harmless." But that spirit was exposed as ideology by the gesture of a working girl who spilled wine on her dress:</page><page sequence="13">88 SUSAN F. BUCK-MORSS It should be noted that microscopic analysis was an early characteristic in Benjamin's writings, pre-dating his move to Marxism, at a time when he was influenced by German Romantic theories of literary criticism (especially Novalis and Schlegel),46 and by the Kabbalah, the tradition of the Jewish mysticism to which Gershom Scholem had introduced Benjamin in the 1910's. An outline of this method in its pre-Marxist form was provided by Benjamin in Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels (1927) where he applied it to the task of literary criticism.47 Here the phenomena were historical texts rather than natural objects : the "idea" of Baroque tragic drama was "decoded" out of the arrangement, not of dishes and cups, but of the extreme and often contradictory elements which the texts of these dramas contained. It was as a method of textual analysis (but placed within the frame of Marxist theory) that Benjamin's approach appeared to Adorno as such a potentially fruitful tool for his own project, the liquidation of idealism. A microscopic analysis which could identify the general (i.e., the bourgeois social structure) within the particular (the details of bourgeois philosophic texts), could indicate more than the social function of ideas (Ideologiekritik); it promised to make possible statements of objective truth, albeit historically specific. Rather than simply demonstrating the ideological implications of philosophic schools, the way in which general positions (positivism, irrationalism, and the like) acted as supports to the status quo, this method took Adorno deep into the particulars of the philosophic texts so that the very words and their arrangements, apparently insignificant details, became meaningful, releasing a significance not even intended by the author. Indeed "unintentional truth" was precisely the object of Adorno's critical "While her face beamed with enthusiasm, reflecting the general gaiety, her hands proceeded with unconscious haste to remove the stain. This isolated hand betrayed the whole festive communality." (Max Horkheimer, Dämmerung [1934], p. 15.) Horkheimer's concern with the way a specific act reflected the particular class structure of society separated him too from Simmel. But despite important similarities with Benjamin, Horkheimer's approach was not identical: whereas he used gestures and details of behavior symbolically to illustrate social injustice by concrete example, Benjamin approached the detail as a mystery containing the general in a way that had to be deciphered: natural objects needed to be "brought to speech" inductively, by means of critical interpretation. Adorno referred to "a certain broadness of interpretation" in Horkheimer's Dämmerung which at first "annoyed me in certain aphorisms"; but when he read the finished book he could "almost completely identify with it - so completely that it is difficult for me to point to differences."

Adorno and the Dilemma of Bourgeois Philosophy 89 inquiry. But before examining more closely this idea of unintentional truth (which was also Benjamin's originally), it may be helpful by way of summary to make explicit the aspects of "non-identity" contained within the concept of the "concrete particular." The particular was not "a case of the general"; it could not be identified by placing it within a general category, for its significance lay in its contingency rather than its universality.48 Further (and this was what separated the theory from nominalism), the particular was not identical to itself. It was more than the tautological "rose is a rose" because of its mediated relationship to society.49 Like Leibniz's monads,50 each particular was unique, yet each contained a picture of the whole, an "image of the world,"51 which within a Marxist frame meant an image of the bourgeois social structure. And (against Leibniz52), because this general social reality was also not absolute, but a particular moment within the social totality,53 instead of being ontologically and eternally valid, it was itself "sedimented history."54 There was also a Utopian dimension to non-identity as it related to the 48 Cf.: "It is not up to philosophy to exhaust things according to scientific usage, to reduce the phenomena to a minimum of propositions. . . .Instead, in philosophy we literally seek to immerse ourselves in things that are heterogeneous. . . without placing those things in prefabricated categories." (Adorno, Negative Dialectics, p. 13.) That the particular could not even be adequately comprehended as a case of the concept is illustrated in my Chapter III: a natural object was not only natural, but historical; a historical phenomenon was not merely history but material nature. (Cf.: ". . .objects do not go into their concepts without leaving a remainder " [Ibid., p. 5.]) 49 One is reminded of Marx's comment that a Negro was a Negro; only under certain social conditions did he become a slave. 50 Leibniz challenged the principle of identity as it applied to the issue of universais and the problem of the identity of indiscernables. In his Monadology he wrote: "It is necessary, indeed, that each monad be different from every other. For there are never in nature two beings which are exactly alike and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference " (Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, "Die Monadologie," Hauptschriften zur Grundlegung der Philosophie, ed. Ernst Cassirer [Leipzig, 1906], vol. 2, pp. 436-437. 5 1 "The idea is a monad. That means in brief, every idea contains an image of the world." (Walter Benjamin, Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels, ed. Rolf Tiedemann [Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp Taschenbuch Verlag, 1972], p. 32.) 52 Leibniz's monadology was atomistic in that each monad remained "without windows," isolated from the others. Adorno claimed that it "contains the model for the individualistic concept of the concrete human being in bourgeois society." ([Theodor W. Adorno], "Individuum," in Institut fur Sozialforschung, Soziologische Exkurse [vol. 4 of Frankfurter Beiträge zur Soziologie, eds. Theodor W. Adorno and Walter Dirks] [Franfurt am Main: Europäische Verlagsanstalt, 1956], p. 4L) 53 Cf.: "What dissolves the fetish [i.e., the "given object"] is the insight that things are not simply so and not otherwise, that they have come to be under certain conditions."

The transitoriness of particulars was the promise of a different future, while their small size, their elusiveness to categorization implied a defiance of the very social structure they expressed. Reading the non-identity of the particular as a promise of utopia was an idea Adorno took from Ernst Bloch.55 Insisting on recognition of the "not-yet-existing" (Nochnicht-seiende),56 Bloch grounded hope for the future in those non-identical "traces" (Spuren)51 of utopia already experienced within the present. In his inaugural lecture, Adorno echoed this thought: ". . .only in traces (Spuren) and ruins" was there "hope of ever coming across genuine and just reality."58 That the locus of Utopian hope was in the small things, in details which slipped out of the conceptual net, was an idea Adorno had already expressed in his philosophy of music, and it remained important in his aesthetic theory. As he wrote in 1928 in regard to Schubert's music: But change succeeds only in the smallest thing. Where the scale is large, death dominates.59 II. Unintentional Truth Interpretation of the unintentional through a juxtaposition of the analytically isolated elements, and illumination of the real by the power of such interpretation: that is the program of every authentically materialist knowledge; . . .60 Crucial to "negative dialectics" was not only the object's non-identity with itself, but its non-identity with the knowing subject, the mind and its logical processes. In Adorno's inaugural lecture, this level of non- identity found expression in the term "unintentional truth" and 55 "While he [Bloch] pursued the historico-philosophic character of utopia materialistically in the illusion-less struggle for the fundamental necessities of life, he searched for the 'traces' of utopia, of finite redemption shining into [the present], in the smallest features of. . .reality. . . ." (Theodor W. Adorno, "Für Ernst Bloch," Westküste, [27 November 1942]. Auß au- Rekonstruktion 8, 48 [27 November 1942], p. 17.) 56 Bloch introduced this term in Geist der Utopie (1923). 57 In 1930, Bloch published a book which described these "traces" in aphoristic fragments.

Adorno and the Dilemma of Bourgeois Philosophy 91 Adorno's choice of words was not without significance. At the time, Horkheimer and his colleagues at the Institute were also insisting that subject and object were not identical.61 But the notion of "the unintentional" said more. If the Institute's Ideologiekritik essays exposed the untruth of identity (of the Hegelian claim that the real was rational), Adorno was stating the converse as well: non-identity was the locus of truth.62 In the strange and singular theory of cognition which Benjamin outlined in his Trauerspiel book63 (which brushed up against materialism far more intimately than its own, Kabbalist-inspired author first intended) the idea of the "unintentional" played a central role: Truth never enters into a relation, and particularly not an intentional one. The object of knowledge as something determined within conceptual intention is not truth. Truth, built out of ideas [rather than appearing within them], is unintentional Being. The procedure which adequately conforms to it is therefore not an intending within the knowing process, but an entering into [truth] and disappearing. Truth is the death of intention.64 Benjamin's argument was a critical reversal of the "doctrine of intentionality" which, formulated by the medieval Scholastic Duns Scotus, had been revived by Franz Brentano 65 and incorporated into the phenomenology of his pupil, Edmund Husserl. We are back in Husserl's garden. For the purpose of the doctrine of intentionality was to distinguish empirical objects (e.g., the actually existing apple tree) from intentional objects (the tree as it existed in the thought of it) whose objectivity did not reside in empirical existence. (That such "objects" as unicorns or mermaids could be thought about was seen to demonstrate the necessity of this distinction.) What appealed to Husserl, of course, was that this doctrine could be used to justify his "bracketing out" process: if judgments of truth could be made about objects whether or not they actually existed, then phenomenology could avoid resting its case on the shakey, uncertain ground of empirical 61 Cf., e.g. Horkheimer, "Hegel und das Problem der Metaphysik" (1932); Herbert Marcuse, "The Concept of Essence" (1936), Negations: Essays in Critical Theory, trans. Jeremy J. Shapiro (Boston: Beacon Press, 1968), pp. 43-87. 62 Cf.: ". . .the concept of ideology makes sense only in relation to the truth or untruth of what it refers to."

BUCK-MORSS beings - just those concrete, transitory particulars which Adorno and Benjamin considered crucial. Benjamin's rejection of intentionality may have had its source in a mystical impulse; yet it converged with materialism in its claim that the object was the source of truth.66 The subject needed to go to the object, to enter into it, whereas to stop short at the "thought objects" was to discover nothing more than the subject's own reflection as "intention." Benjamin had not so much proven the unintentionality of truth as asserted it in the Trauerspiel study. Later, Adorno, in his lengthy study on Husserl, would demonstrate how Husserl's method led him unavoidably back into the circle of idealism which he had tried to escape, and use this criticism to validate his own, materialist premise of unintentionality. 67 It should be noted that this notion was "materialist" not so much in the Marxian sense as in the simpler sense of pre-Kantian empiricism.68 Except, it was even more extreme: Adorno insisted that philosophy recognize not only natural objects as "matter," but geistige phenomena as well (including Husserl's notion of "thought objects"). The "material" of ideas, theories, concepts, of novels and musical compositions, like physical matter, lived, grew old and decayed. Not even the products of thought, then, were mere subjectivity, and this meant that they, too, were the locus of "unintentional truth." Describing phenomena as if they had a life of their own,69 as if they expressed a truth of which their human creator was unaware, was a unique feature of Benjamin's writings. It was a kind of anthropomorphism, a modern expression of the archaic, which surfaced in Adorno's works as well. But rather than robbing nature of its otherness by identifying it with the subject, this anthropomorphism had the inverse effect of increasing the non-identity, the strangeness of the object. Benjamin called this strangeness "aura."70 66 It was the meaning of what Adorno in Negative Dialectics called the "Vorrang des Objects" (trans, "preponderance of the object"). (See Adorno, Negative Dialectics, pp. 182-186.) 67 Cf. Adorno, Metakritik der Erkenntnistheorie, Gs 5, pp. 7-245. 68 This was, of course, just the point on which Adorno's early mentor, Hans Cornelius, had "fallen behind Kant." (See my chapter I.) 69 "The idea of life and afterlife in a work of art should be regarded with an entirely unmetaphorical objectivity. Even in times of narrowly prejudiced thought there was an inkling that life was not limited to organic corporeality." (Walter Benjamin, "The Task of the Translator" [1923] Illuminations, ed. and introd. Hannah Arendt, trans. Harry Zohn [New York: Schocken Books, 1969], p. 71.) 70 In Dialektik der Aufklärung (first published in 1947) Adorno wrote that the archaic origin of "aura" was the "mana" of natural objects whereby primitive men</page><page sequence="18">T. W. Adorno and the Dilemma of Bourgeois Philosophy 93 It was a notion Bertolt Brecht found intolerable. Commenting on Benjamin's 1934 essay, "Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit" (ironically precisely the essay which Adorno for other reasons criticized as too Brechtian71) in his diary, published only recently, Brecht wrote: Benjamin is here he says: when you feel a gaze directed to you, even behind your back, you return it (!). the expectation that what you look at looks back at you, provides the aura, the latter is supposed to be in decay in recent times, together with the cultic. b[enjamin] discovered this through the analysis of film, where aura disintegrates because of the reproductability of artworks, it is all mysticism mysticism, in a posture opposed to mysticism, it is in such a form that the materialistic concept of history is adopted ! it is rather ghastly.72 Mysticism, indeed; but perhaps not such bad materialism as Brecht assumed. In analysing geistige phenomena, such anthropomorphism could have the effect of intensifying materialist awareness rather than attenuating it. In fact, it was precisely this orientation of Benjamin and Adorno which distinguished their method from the bourgeois approach to Geisteswissenschaft. The latter found its most conscious articulation in the writings of Wilhelm Dilthey. Once again, a comparison is instructive. Like Adorno, Dilthey was concerned with concrete, historically particular phenomena73 whose structural forms bore the acknowledged the objects1 otherness. Mana was the source of both terror and sacredness. "When the tree is no longer approached merely as tree, but as evidence for an Other, as the location of mana, language expresses the contradiction that something is itself and at the same time something other than itself, identical and not identical." That Adorno's conception of the object had more in common with this view of the tree, than with Husserl's of his apple tree, is clear. (Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, Dialectic of Enlightenment, trans. John Cumming [New York: Herder and Herder, 1972], p. 15.) 71 Adorno criticized this essay because of Benjamin's affirmation of popular art, in which the "aura" disappeared and the art object became a political medium. After reading the essay, Adorno wrote Benjamin that he felt his task was "to hold your arm stiff until the Brechtian sun once again sinks into exotic waters. "(Letter, Adorno to Benjamin, 18 March 1936, in Ueber Walter Benjamin, p. 134.) 72 Bertolt Brecht: Arbeitsjournal, ed. Werner Hecht, vol. 1: 1938-1942 (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1973), p. 16. (Entry is from July 25, 1938.) 73 One of Husserl's motives for attempting to establish phenomenology as a "pure" and "scientific" method was to fight the kind of relativism which, as he was well aware, had caused such trouble for Dilthey because he had acknowledged historical particularity. (Nonetheless, Husserl late in life began to see validity in Dilthey's concept of Leben, and worked with it in his own theoretical writings.)</page><page sequence="19">94 SUSAN F. BUCK-MORSS imprint of a specific social era. Cultural "objects" - texts, documents, artworks, and the like - demanded interpretation, and, according to Dilthey, this interpretive, hermeneutic approach was what distinguished the method of Geisteswissenschaft from that of the natural sciences. Adorno made a similar distinction between philosophy and science in his inaugural lecture : "Plainly stated : the idea of science is research; that of philosophy is interpretation."74 But despite the fact that Adorno's negative dialectics was clearly a hermeneutic procedure, it diverged radically from Dilthey's hermeneutics, and the notion of "unintentionality" provides the key to that difference: Dilthey treated geistige phenemona as psychological expressions; his aim in interpreting them was to recapture the original subjective meaning, the original intention behind the written word or other form of cultural expression.75 In contrast, Adorno wanted to know what the cultural objects were saying despite their creators' intent: ". . .ascribed to the basic assumptions of philosophic interpretation" was "construction out of small, unintentional elements"76 within geistige phenomena. For Dilthey, it was the artist which hermeneutics tried to understand; for Adorno it was the artwork. Benjamin's study of Goethe's novel, Die Wahlverwandtschaften (Elective Affinities), written in 1921-22, before he met Adorno, had protested the Diltheyian approach to literary history. He argued that the truth of the novel depended neither on the interpreter's ability to empathetically identify with the sentiments expressed in the novel, 77 nor 74 Adorno, "Die Aktualität der Philosophie (1931), GS 1, p. 334. 75 Dilthey's stress on intentional meaning led his theory into an irreconcilable paradox: If the goal of interpreting historical texts was reliving through empathetic understanding the psychological experiences of past eras, then implied was the assumption of an ahistorical similarity of subjects, a universal core of human nature which cancelled out the very historical particularity which had been the raison d'etre of a geisteswissenschaftliche method in the first place. The Diltheyian interpreter re- experienced himself; he could understand only his own likeness, and hence his knowledge could disclose nothing new. As Rolf Tiedemann has written: ". . .thus the Diltheyian historian acknowledges in history only what extends into the present, which is an 'expression' of his own 'life,' and thereby accessible to his 'understanding.'" (Rolf Tiedemann, Studien zur Philosophie Walter Benjamins, p. 115.) Dilthey became caught in a circle of psychological subjectivism, while historical relativism threatened all judgments concerning reality external to the subject. But when the non-identity between written word and subjective intent was recognized, and when the former rather than the latter became the focus of interpretation, historical phenomena with no eternal meaning but instead a life and death of their own, then the whole Diltheyian difficulty was avoided (cf. Chapter III). 76 Adorno, "Die Aktualität der Philosophie" (1931), GS 1, p. 336. 77 Cf.

Adorno and the Dilemma of Bourgeois Philosophy 95 with the author's intent:78 instead, truth lay within the novel itself. This truth was not immune to history, and perception of it was in fact enhanced by the temporal distance separating the interpreter from his object. 79 Adorno's early experience with the reproduction of music, his awareness of the difficulties in trying to recapture the truth of a past composition within a present interpretation, had led him to the same conclusion. 80 For a part of the problem was that, as he later expressed it : "great works can be recognized in the difference between that which stands out in them and their own intention."81 But not until Benjamin and Adorno articulated the problem within the frame of a Marxist theory of society did they name the source of the "unintentional" elements: the socio-economic structure mediated all geistige production and hence expressed itself within cultural artifacts alongside (and often in contradiction to) the subjective intention of their creators. Geistige phenomena were therefore not exhausted by an analysis of subjective psychology. But they were also not reduceable to the substructure alone, as the "copy theory" of orthodox Marxism maintained. Against both psychological and economic reductionism, Benjamin argued : The question is namely: if the substructure determines the superstructure to a certain degree, its thought and experience material, yet this determination is not one of simple copying or reflection, how is it then - totally apart from the question of its causal origins - to be characterized ? As its expression {Ausdruck). The superstructure is the expression of the substructure. The economic conditions under which society exists come to expression in the superstructure. 82 Once again, a literal affinity with the language of Diltheyian 78 "Wanting to make the Wahlverwandtschaften accessible to understanding by means of the author's own words is a misplaced effort. They are precisely suited for barring criticism from access. . . [The reason lies] in the tendency to leave unnoticed all that which the author's own explanation disavows." {Ibid., p. 275.) 79 For Benjamin, the truth content of an artwork was not identical to its substantive content: "For, in separating within the work, they [Wahrheitsgehalt and Sachgehalt] decide the question of its immorality. In this sense, the history of the works prepares their critique, the power of which is thus increased by historical distance." (ibid., pp. 255-256.) 80 Cf. my Chapter III. 81 Theodor W.

BUCK-MORSS hermeneutics illuminates the non-identity of the two positions. For Dilthey, cultural phenomena were "expressions" (Ausdrucke) of "life," the articulation of conscious reflection upon past experience. But if that phenomena "expressed" was the objective social structure, and this occurred despite conscious intent, then the focus of interpretation shifted to the opposite (the objective, materialist) pole. Hence, for example, art was interpreted ". . . as a medium of the unconscious history-writing of society."83 It was this aspect of "unintentional truth," of course, which enabled Adorno to argue that the artist could best serve society by ignoring politics and concentrating on his material, just as it allowed him to call Schonberg's music revolutionary in not just a cultural but a political, Marxian sense, despite Schonberg's own lack of sympathy for Marxism. Unlike more orthodox Marxists, Adorno could maintain that bourgeois art, and also bourgeois philosophy, were not simply ideology, and that they should thus be interpreted as more than false consciousness.84 Ideology was exposed by demonstrating the historical character of premises which were accepted as "second nature;" to quote Lukács: "What philosophy does not find problematic."85 But the truth content of bourgeois thought lay in the opposite direction, in the "breaks" (Bruche) in its logic, the gaps of its systematic unity. Indeed, because truth revealed itself in the non-identity between psychological intent and its concrete objectification, the bourgeois thinker was most likely to express truth when he felt himself farthest away. Paradoxically, then, his theory gained in truth in proportion to its admission of failure, for this failure bore witness to a reality whose real contradictions could not be resolved on the level of thought alone. The bourgeois thinker expressed truth in spite of himself; or, rather, like Freudian slips of the tongue, truth surfaced in the inconsistencies of his theory, now more than ever, because of philosophy's "disintegration." Here was an important corollary to the principle of 83 [Adorno], "Kunst und Musiksoziologie," Soziologische Exkurse, p. 93. 84 A comparison with Lukács on this point is illuminating. Lukács condemned late bourgeois philosophy almost in toto as ideology (see Georg Lukács, Die Zerstörung der Vernunft: Der Weg des Irrationalismus von Schelling zu Hitler [Berlin: Aufbau Verlag, 1953].) Yet he considered art another matter. With his preference for classical aesthetics, he continued to praise writers like Shakespeare, Balzac and Thomas Mann, whose objectivity enabled them to capture social truth in their works despite their lack of radical political consciousness. What allowed him to make an exception of certain bourgeois artists was far less his Marxist theory than a residual romantic concept of the artist as capable of immediate intuitions of truth. In contrast, Adorno's opposition, whether or not it was more "Marxist," was at least more consistent. 85 Lukács, History and Class Consciousness, p. 122.</page><page sequence="22">T. W. Adorno and the Dilemma of Bourgeois Philosophy 97 unintentional truth, one which was specifically Adorno's contribution. 86 Ever since his first exposure to philosophy, when at age sixteen he read Kant's Critique of Pure Reason together with Kracauer on Sunday afternoons, he had been struck by the significance of logical breaks : If later, in regard to the traditional philosophic texts, I not so much let myself be impressed by their unity and systematic coherence as I concerned myself with the play of opposing and conflicting forces which goes on under the surface of every self-contained theoretical position, and which codified philosophy sometimes accounts for as force-fields, then it was certainly Kracauer who gave me the idea. He made the Critique of Pure Reason present to me not simply as a system of transcendental idealism. Much more, he showed me ... how the most eloquent parts of the work are the wounds which the conflict in the theory leaves behind. 87 The fractures, the ambiguities and contradictions, were the philosophic details upon which Adorno focussed his interpretive efforts. Although Adorno was convinced that truth lay in the object, not in the mind which strove to know it in thought, even there it was not intentional. "Given" reality was not somehow in accord with divine intention, or with that of Hegel's absolute Reason : "... it is not the task of philosophy to portray reality as meaningful in a positive sense and to justify it."88 Philosophy . . .does all the more justice to the materialistic procedure, the more it distances itself from every "meaning" of its objects and the less it relates itself to an implicit, quasi-religious meaning. 89 Adorno agreed with Goethe who cautioned : "Do not look behind the phenomena; they themselves are the truth."90 Yet in their mere "givenness" they were as absurd as Sartre's anguished hero had 86 However, the theme of ruptures and breaks occurs in Benjamin's early writings as well: first, in the sense that reality is brüchig, and forms no harmonious totality; second in his notion of the rupture between the truth ( Wahrheitsgehalt) and substance (Sachgehalt) of a work of art occurring with the historical passage of time.

Instead, he saw them as necessary co-determinates: neither mind nor matter could dominate the other as a philosophic first principle. Truth resided in the object, but it did not lie ready at hand; the material object needed the rational subject in order to release the truth which it contained. 91 Positivism and existentialism converged in their passive acceptance of the object as given.
