This book represents a valiant and stimulating attempt to extract a consistent story from the archaeological and linguistic facts of Aegean prehistory before the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age about 2000 B. C. The author's claims are modest, - that he is just as it were stopping to glance round him and survey the scene at a time when the body of scientific material is always rapidly increasing and opening the way to new per spectives. The book was originally intended as the first part of a work which would include the later Bronze Age (Minoan and Mycenaean) cultures. But the publication of the second part has been delayed until it is possible to assess the results of the decipherment by Ventris of the Linear B script, which Schachermeyr himself explicitly accepts as Greek. The basic theme is the elucidating of the original Mediterranean* elements, which eventually in fusion with later intrusive Indo-European elements, led to the development of Greek civilization. In fact the book is largely crystalised round two main ideas upon which Schachermeyr has already done much work: (A) Comparison of the pottery shapes and decoration of the earliest peasant cultures of the Aegean and East Europe with those of the Near East as evidence for a spread of peoples and civili zation from East to West; (B) Evidence for a language complex which corresponds to this complex of early cultures in the Aegean-Anatolian area. (A) The idea that the earliest Neolithic culture was introduced to the Aegean in the first instance by immigrants from the East is not new and might be considered as orthodox nowadays. The general resemblances in pottery and other aspects of civilization between the Aegean Neolithic cultures and the early cultures of the Near East have been recognized by many scholars as Schachermeyr emphasises. Various scholars have even compared specific vase types etc. from the Near East with equivalents from the Aegean and Balkan areas, as Jirku, Die ?ltere Kupfer-Steinzeit Pal?stinas und der bandkeramische Kulturkreis (1941), and Woolley (Liverpool Annais 10, 1923, 36 f, cf. Pendlebury, Archaeology of Crete, 1939, 42) for the Cretan Neolithic. Schachermeyr is however the first to attempt large-scale comparisons in a systematic manner. He claims that nearly the whole range of vase forms of the Aegean Neolithic can be derived from prototypes in Cilicia and North Mesopotamia. In emphasising the relative importance of shape as</page><page sequence="2">512 S. Hood: Schachermeyr, Die ?ltesten Kulturen Griechenlands opposed to decoration as a basis for pottery comparisons S. is surely right. But while admitting the general resemblances between early Aegean/ Balkan and Near Eastern pottery, it may perhaps be open to doubt whe ther a system of detailed comparisons of the kind which S. makes between individual vase shapes and elements of decoration, isolated from their context and considered apart from the general background of the particul ar culture to which they belong, really helps to increase our knowledge. There is a danger that this kind of selection may give a false impression of precise connections and stimulate a degree of speculative theorizing that is far beyond what the facts will bear. But it is only fair to say that S. himself frankly admits such dangers, and is extremely tentative and mo derate, always willing to allow other possibilities, in advancing his own ideas. Moreover this criticism does not apply for instance to his comparison between the Dhimini culture pottery, and that from the cultures of the B?kk, Theiss and Westsiebenb?rgen region (Mitt, der Anthr. Gesell schaft Wien 81-82, 1953, 1 f)- The parallels here (although mostly of decoration not shape!) are reasonably convincing by their number and many points of detailed resemblance. Moreover the things compared are one specific and clearly characterized culture on the one hand, and a group of closely related cultures in a contiguous geographical area on the other. The comparisons here in fact have a definition of character that makes them interesting (regardless of what interpretation, e. g. trade influences, migrations, coincidence, may be put upon them). (B) At the end of the book (Part 4, esp. ch. 27) S. develops his concept of an c Aegean5 language complex. The area of the 'Aegean5 language closely corresponds to that covered by the earliest Neolithic peasant cultures arriv ing from the East, i. e. Anatolia and the Aegean with Lower Italy and the Balkans. Our knowledge of it is reconstructed from place-names (including mountain, river and island names) with evidently non-Indo European stems and endings, notably the suffixes in ndjt(h) and s(s), of which S. gives useful distribution maps. With such proper names may be connected various words of a similar appearance and apparently non Indo-European origin surviving in later Greek. S. rejects the views of Brandenstein attributing the introduction of such place-names and words to an Indo-European people entering Greece about 1200 B.C. Dating. Schachermeyr agrees with M atz and Milojcic in following a clow chronology* for the beginning of Troy I about 2700 B. C, against the 3200 B. C. proposed by Biegen and (formerly!) Weinberg. He makes the beginning of Early Minoan I, Early Helladic I and Troy I roughly correspond in time (although E.M. I would begin slightly before E.H. I), and equate with the Early Bronze Age 'Anatolian Culture' in Cilicia. In the light of the recent (1954) excavations by Milojcic in Thessaly, S. has now placed the whole course, beginning and end, of the Dhimini culture back in the Neolithic before the start of Early Helladic and Troy I. Part 1 ch. 4 gives an excellent review of the development of early civilization in the Near East. The earliest cultures here S. regards as representing parallel aspects of the same general tendency operating throughout a wide area in which comparable conditions prevailed. Thus the art of making pottery might well have originated independently in Mesopotamia and North Africa; the earliest clay vases from the two regions certainly</page><page sequence="3">S. Hood: Schachermeyr, Die ?ltesten Kulturen Griechenlands 513 show quite different traditions. The S amarra and Tal Halaf pottery of the c Middle Chalcolithic' developed in Mesopotamia from the earliest primitive local painted ware, and was not imported from Iran. There is a great deal about the 'Matriarchal Principle' in the early Near East and its survival in the Aegean area and Anatolia. S. has the concept of a single great culture-province with its centre of influence in the East, stretching from the Mersin-Malatya area of East Anatolia across to the Aegean, South Italy and the Balkans, from the 5th to the beginning of the 3rd millenium B. C. Parallel with this diffusion from the Near East was a second movement of diffusion but on a much smaller scale from Egypt and North Africa to Crete, Spain and Italy. S. ad mits the possibility of a third wave of diffusion from Mesopotamia and Iran over the plains of Central Asia and South Russia, and suggests that the earliest pottery (Erteb?lle) of the Baltic area may be due to influences from this quarter. Ch. 5. S. inclines to emphasise the importance of the land route across Anatolia (as opposed to the sea-route along the South Anatolian coast) as the way by which immi grants drifted* to the Aegean from the Near East in the first instance. The rarity of finds of early painted pottery from Anatolia is admittedly a difficulty; although S.'s first wave of immigrants have unpainted pottery of a proto-Sesklo type (A 2 ware with fingernail etc. decoration) as found by Milojcic in the lowest levels at Otzaki Magu?a in Thessaly; and painted pottery has been found at Kaymak Tepe on the west coast of Anatolia, and in small quantities by Mellaart on a few sites in the Konya plain (Anatolian Studies 4, 1954, i86f, which S. cites). S. admits however that the sea-route may have played a more important role in introducing the later waves of influence from the Near East which helped to effect the transition from his 'Proto-Sesklo* to the Sesklo culture. Trade may have been largely responsible for the spread of these later influences and would find the sea-route convenient. S. suggests that imported patterned textiles may have helped in spreading a fashion for pottery with painted decoration in Greece. Ch. 6. S. notes the importance of the Ionian Islands as a centre exporting flint to the rest of Greece in Neolithic times. Ch. 7. S. thinks that the Cretan Neolithic pottery shows influences from the Sesklo culture and from Egypt and the Levant. He claims that the earliest A 2 ware of the Sesklo culture is also found in Crete, and believes that Epi-palaeolithic hunters may have existed in Crete before the arrival of Neolithic immi grants. In Part 2 S. describes the Boian and Bandkeramik cultures that were developed on the northern fringe of the Sesklo area under Sesklo influence but not by immigrants from the East. S. accepts the C. 14 dating for the earliest phases of the Bandkeramik cul ture about 4200/4000 B. C, which agrees with his belief in a very early beginning for the drift of culture from the Near East. Ch. 10. S. emphasises how new vase types coming into fashion in the Near East spread to the Aegean and the Balkans, and suggests that one important factor in spreading fashions may have been imported metal vases, when these began to be made in the Near East and Anatolia. At first however (in the Sesklo period for instance) it was only the shape and not the surface finish of such metal vases that was imitated. Ch. il. S. agrees with the general view that the spiral motive of decoration spread from Central Europe to the Aegean area, and thence eventually to Egypt and the Near East. He accepts Milojci?'s division of the Starcevo culture into three successive phases, the last (III) characterised by spiral decoration. S. isolates a variety of pottery, found by him in quantities at Galepsos and known from other sites in Chalkidike and Thrace, and distinguished from Dhimini wrare with which it is more or less contemporary by having spiral decoration but no maeanders. This he thinks may reflect a subsidiary migration from the North about the time of the great Dhimini invasion. The latter he brings from Hungary (Biikk, Theiss and Westsiebenb?rgen area). The Dhimini people may have introduced the Megaron type house, though Megaron houses are admittedly found in the Near East and might have reached the Aegean from there direct. S. rejects the view that the Megaron buildings at Dhimini and Sesklo really belong* to a Bronze Age phase after the Dhimini culture. He emphasises the Sesklo 33 Gnomon 19s 7</page><page sequence="4">514 S- Hood: Schachermeyr, Die ?ltesten Kulturen Griechenlands element in the Dhimini pottery, reflecting a co-existence of the Dhimini people with the earlier inhabitants. Ch. 12. S. postulates a very early development of metal working and of metal vase making in Anatolia. (This he suggests may be one reason why the potters of Anatolia were apparently less interested than those of Cilicia, Mesopotamia and Greece, in having painted decoration on their vases!) Even in the Sesklo period pottery imitations of metal vase shapes began to be made in the Aegean. The black polished ware of the late Neolithic is metal imitating in the strongest sense, with an attempt to reproduce not only the shape but also the finish of metal ware, cf. the Uruk wares of the East; although (156) S. inclines to attribute both the changes in shape and the development of mono chrome wares in the Uruk period as much to the introduction of the fast potters' wheel as to imitation of metal vases. S. endorses the concept of Milojcic of a T-horizon' at the end of the Neolithic period (after the end of Sesklo and Dhimini) characterised by black-burnished ware. This corre sponds with the red pattern-burnished ware from some of the Aegean islands, and with Early Minoan I in Crete. The Vinca culture belongs to this horizon, and was introduced from the south probably by an invasion from Anatolia through Thrace and Macedonia. S. tentatively suggests that the black-burnished ware was brought to Thessaly and Greece by a secondary invasion of the same people who had first made their way to Vinca. The Rachmani culture of the T-horizon reflects one of several smaller invasions from the north at this time. Possibly Indo-European speaking people were involved in the Rachmani invasion. Ch. 13. S. thinks that the islands of the Cyclades must have been occupied by Neo lithic settlers from the East as early as the time of the Sesklo culture. He postulates some sort of Sesklo-like culture which may have preceeded the Pelos culture, but of which no trace has yet been found. He suggests that the Pelos culture was introduced from the Near East via Anatolia. The pyxis shape however may have been a local Cycladic invention. Syros ware with its spiral decoration S. believes must reflect strong influences from the Bandkeramik-type cultures of the Dalmatian area, and even in the light of discoveries on the island of Hvar (L?sina) on the Dalmatian coast may have been brought by immigrants by sea from that region. S. conceives that there was a great wave of metal vase influence at the end of the T-period. The red burnished pottery which now became the fashion was imitating the surface of copper ware. To the list of metal objects from a Neolithic context in the Aegean (273 note in) add the flat axe from an Upper Neolithic house at Knossos (Evans, Palace of Minos 2, fig. 3 f). Ch. 16. In discussing Troy S. notes that the fast potters' wheel was being used there (Troy lib) earlier than anywhere else in the Aegean area. Ch. 17. The appearance of fortifications in the Cyclades and in Early Helladic Greece S. regards as a sign of in fluence from the Troad. Actual immigration from the Troad brought a Troy I?II type culture into Macedonia and Chalkidike. Ch. 19. S. gives a good account of the Early Helladic civilisation. At first the Early Helladic culture (E. H. I) was confined to Central Greece (Argolis, Attica and Boeotia). Later (E. H. II) there was a great expansion of population, reflected in the larger number and increased size of the settlements. This expansion may have been helped by fresh immigrations from Anatolia, whence the original Early Helladic culture derived. The decline in the production of anthropomorphic figurines may have been partly due to the importing of marble figurines from the Cyclades. The re-appearance of painted decora tion on pottery at the end of the Early Helladic period (E. H. Ill) reflects the recovery of the potter's art from the over-riding influence of metal work. S. emphasises that Crete and the mainland of Greece in the Early Bronze Age (Early Helladic and Early Minoan) belonged to the same cultural complex, although it is often impossible to say in which direction influences ran. Ch. 20. S. discusses the problem of whether the Battle-Axe folk, presumably Indo European speakers, had already penetrated the Aegean area before the end of the Early</page><page sequence="5">R. Syme: Reidinger, Die Statthalter Pannoniens 515 Helladic period. He is inclined to accept the views of Fuchs about the influence of the Battle Axe culture on mature Early Helladic pottery (E. H. II), while admitting the pos sibility that many types of vases and elements of decoration may have travelled from the Aegean to the north. On the whole he thinks that the Battle Axe folk may have begun to penetrate the middle and south of Greece in a small way during Early Helladic times, although actual Greek speaking peoples first invaded Greece in large numbers only at the end of E. H. III. But already in the Early Bronze Age Greek speaking people may have penetrated into Macedonia and the Troad, and may even perhaps have percolated into parts of Greece. But not all Battle Axe folk were necessarily Greek speakers, and the Battle Axe folk who in the Early Bronze Age entered Macedonia and the Troad may well have been the ancestors of the later Luvians, Hittites and Thracians. Ch. 21. S. emphasises the great diversity in the pottery of the earliest Bronze Age (E. M. I) in Crete, reflecting possible immigrations from the Cyclades, Anatolia and the Levant, Egypt and North Africa. In E. M. Ill the spiral was introduced from the north, and more especially from the Cyclades. The maeander pattern, which is apparently lacking in the Cyclades, may however reflect influences direct from the Balkans, and such Balkan influences may also be responsible for the tendency towards polychrome decoration on pottery which begins at the end of E. M. III. Ch. 22. S. ends Part 3 with a chapter on Megalithic building, and suggests that the fashion of constructing round houses spread from North Africa to the Aegean, where it was virtually confined to graves and chieftains' houses like the great 'Round House' at Tiryns. The Early Minoan round graves (tholos tombs) of the Messara were probably introduced by immigrants from North Africa. S. does not touch upon the vexed question of the way in which the Messara round graves were roofed, but by implication he regards the later tholos tomb of Mainland Greece and Crete as a development from the Mega lithic round building idea.
