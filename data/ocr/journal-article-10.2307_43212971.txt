Meta-narratives, essential for the construction of national identities, tend to be rooted in traumatic events that involve large-scale force and violence. The construction and maintenance of a national meta-narrative is a political process involving many actors, both domestic and international. These actors, or 'agents of memory', as they have been called in studies of collective memory and transitional justice (Aguilar 1999), play numerous roles in society. Besides the primary struggle to define what happened (establish 'truth') during traumatic periods of the past, they seek to honor victims and identify perpetrators. At the same time, they engage in battles with those 'agents' who wish to silence the discussion of the past or propose alternative narratives. Agents of memory thus aim to establish a relationship between their understanding of the past and political future -oriented nation -building projects (Jelin 2003). Recent collective memory studies tend to acknowledge the role of gender in the process of constructing a national meta-narrative. Feminist writers describe a bipolar gender system of givers and takers. According to this understanding, men are assigned a more important role in narrating, interpreting, and collecting factual knowledge about the national past than women, who focus instead on private family stories. Men are seen to act as 'them e-givers' (that is, as the primary agents of memory), who Correspondence to: Dovilé Budryté, Georgia Gwinnett College, Lawrence ville, GA 30043, USA.

Women, on the other hand, are likely to be preoccupied with stories associated with their families; thus, they are likely to act as 4 theme -takers' , or secondary agents of memory. In other words, men tend to serve as the makers of a 'collective encyclopedia' , and women are likely to be charged with the role of creating and preserving 'family albums' (Lenz &amp; Bjerg 2007, p. 39). The existence of such a gendered system means that men and women have different possibilities for identification in narratives of collective memory, in which warriors and resistance fighters are usually men, while women play supporting roles of helpers associated with the sphere of the home (Ibid, p. 40). This paper attempts to question and deconstruct the dichotomy between 'theme- givers' and 'theme- takers', highlighting the interdependent relationship between writing a 'collective encyclopedia' and preserving 'family albums'. I will do so by analyzing a particular group of agents of memory in Lithuania, namely female former deportees, who entered politics after 1991 in order to ensure that their experience of trauma remained a substantial part of the meta-narrative of the Lithuanian nation state. By focusing on female politicians who share the experience of having been deported during the Soviet period, I intend to shed light on the public roles, personal narratives and strategies of women agents of memory in a post-Soviet context. How likely are women agents of memory to communicate their individual trauma publicly in order to influence collective memory and obtain political power? More precisely, how likely are women agents of memory to use certain rhetorical strategies, for example, portraying themselves in public as a victim, something that is commonly associated with weakness? What do they think about the institutionalized images of their traumatic past (e.g., commemoration rituals, films, history textbooks or monuments)? How do they use popular metaphors and recognizable themes to support their own narrative and political goals? These are the questions that will be addressed in this study, focusing on a group of Lithuanian female politicians who have a background of deportation and trauma. Target Group and Methods of Analysis This study focuses on the narratives of women who have experienced the trauma of deportation and who have decided not to surrender their voice, but to bring their traumatic experiences into the political discourse of their country. The interviews were read and analyzed against the backdrop of a more extensive study that was carried out in Lithuania in 2000-2003 and involved 1,598 participants who had experienced deportation and /or political repression in the past. The authors of this study analyzed the psychology of the victims of political violence by documenting the various long-term effects of this violence and the coping strategies that the victims used in order to deal with them (Gailiené &amp; Kazlauskas 2005; Kazlauskas 2006). They identified 'political participation' and 'political beliefs' as two key 'protective factors' that helped the victims of political violence to deal with their traumatic past (Gailiené &amp; Kazlauskas 2005, p. 99).</page><page sequence="3">WOMEN 'AGENTS OF MEMORY' IN POST-SOVIET LITHUANIA 333 Taking this study as an empirical point of departure, in the summer of 2008 I carried out in-depth, semi -structured interviews with three former deportees who had served as members of parliament in the 2004-2008 Lithuanian Seimas (Parliament) and who had been re-elected for another term in 2008: Vincé Vaidevuté Margevičiené and Vida Marija Cigrejiené of the ruling Homeland Union- Christian Democrat coalition, and Dalia Teišerskyté of the Liberals.1 These women can be described as agents of memory, that is political activists who themselves are likely to have experienced significant trauma in the past and who are interested in empowering other victims of political repression and perpetuating collective memory. They are the only women members of the Lithuanian Seimas who have personally experienced deportation. Moreover, to obtain a more nuanced and richer picture of women acting as agents of memory, I also interviewed several active members of organizations who are familiar with and supportive of the three members of parliament identified above. This study features a joint interview with two sisters, Zinaida Jakimavičiené and Julija Péžaité, who are members of Laptevieciai , an organization made up of survivors from the labor camps to which they were deported on the Laptev Sea.2 I begin with an overview of possible roles /influences played by the agents of memory. I then present the results of my analysis, which is embedded in a broader discussion addressing the applicability of gender perspectives to the study of memory politics in general and the agents of memory approach in the Baltic context in particular. History and Politics of Memory in Post-Soviet Lithuania Lithuania's national meta-narrative draws heavily on interpretations of Soviet-era deportations and repressions, which are widely described as 'genocide'. According to this narrative, during the Soviet occupation, the nation was 'dead' (as it was going through the 'Soviet genocide', as well as other traumas related to the loss of sovereignty). Only the political and social transitions in the late 1980s and early 1990s brought the nation back to 'life' and thus provided opportunities for exploring the past. During the late 1 980s and early 1 990s (a period known in Lithuania as Atgimimas, 'national rebirth') several forms of political and cultural memory were created which drew heavily on particular practices of transmission, such as state -sponsored rituals and commemorations of the days when mass deportations had taken place. The written and spoken stories of the victims of deportation and political repression became an important source supporting these forms of collective remembering and memory construction. Yet, at the same time, and quite paradoxically, institutionalized political narratives of state continuity and social victimization under foreign occupation made it necessary regularly to revise and re-interpret the experiences of the victims of Soviet-era political repression. One reason for this paradox is that political democratization created openings for international interventions (for example, by Western emigré Lithuanians and international Jewish groups) and alternative interpretations of the</page><page sequence="4">334 JOURNAL OF BALTIC STUDIES past. It became clear that there was more than one past to be addressed, and that it was very difficult to create one logical, coherent meta-narrative that would be acceptable and emotionally appealing to very different groups. This is especially true regarding the 'Soviet genocide' paradigm and the Holocaust. The restoration of justice was extremely difficult in post-Soviet Lithuania. In 1990 Lithuania adopted a law rehabilitating people who had been victims of political repression under the Soviet regime. According to this law, people who had participated in the Holocaust could not be rehabilitated. State institutions were weak after regaining independence and it was difficult to get reliable archival information. The international community voiced concern about the rehabilitation of Nazi collaborators. Reacting to these concerns, the Lithuanian government refused to rehabilitate approximately 700 of the applicants and allowed some overseas organizations access to the archives. This slowed down the process of rehabilitation and prompted a debate about the complex relationship between the Nazi and Soviet occupations (Eidintas 2002, pp. 360-366; Volertas 1998). During the past 20 years similar highly emotional public debates - about the post-war resistance (many resistance fighters and their families were deported), restitution, the hardships experienced by deportees in the places of deportation, and nostalgia for the Soviet regime - have challenged the leading meta-narrative about the 'Soviet genocide' and other criminal acts committed by the Soviet regime (see for example, Budryté 2005, pp. 179-96). This is when the experiences and accounts of the victims were re-visited. In addition, similar 'battles over memory' have created opportunities for the empowerment of agents of memory. These actors are likely to feel a strong 'duty of memory', a term coined by Paul Ricoeur (2004, p. 89) to describe the commitment which agents of memory make to other victims of political repression to preserve their version of memory. The Agents of Memory and Their Strategies As the literature that explores the strategic politics of collective memory suggests, agents of memory are likely to associate themselves with active social and political groups, who may or may not be in opposition to the ruling regime. Working with these groups, the agents of memory are likely to 'promote particular versions of the past' (Wustenberg 2005, p. 4) and view the construction of a national meta-narrative as crucial battlefields of politics (Jelin 2003). Presumably, one of the reasons why agents of memory become involved in social and political activism in the first place is to obtain greater currency for their version of memory. This is especially true if their version of memory is in opposition to the dominant, state -supported one. If, however, a group's version of memory does not contradict the dominant one, then the agents of memory can choose to 'feed' the leading discourse and thus continue to legitimize it. Such groups may strive for what Ricoeur (2004, p. 85) has referred to as 'a formidable pact (...) between remembrance, memorization, and commemoration'. In addition to pursuing the noble 'duty of memory', agents of memory often have more practical, down-to-earth goals, such as raising money to</page><page sequence="5">WOMEN 'AGENTS OF MEMORY' IN POST-SOVIET LITHUANIA 335 help those who have experienced a similar fate and supporting legislation to pursue the interests of their particular social and political groups (Aguilar 1999, p. 89). Successful agents of memory are likely to be able to appeal to the public and to create functioning social networks. They are likely to employ strategies commonly used by civic and political activists, such as trying to obtain widespread and favorable media coverage of their activities, attracting prominent individuals to their cause, and collecting funds from rank-and-file members (Jelin 2003; Wustenberg 2005). Theoretically, the use of such strategies raises questions about the temptations to ' abuse ' memory for political means. Questions about the potential abuse of the status of victims can be raised. 4 To have been a victim gives you the right to complain, to protest, and to make demands', as Tzvetan Todorov (1995, p. 56) has pointed out. Todorov s insight highlights one important characteristic of memory politics (defined as expressions of political activism shaping collective memory): a strong emotional component. Agents of memory have to be willing to get engaged in what can be described as 'emotional' and even sometimes ' irrational' politics. This observation suggests the applicability of gender perspectives focusing on the study of emotion and trauma to the study of traumatic collective memory in general and the agents of memory in particular. The Gender of Memory: Women and Traumatic Memory in Baltic studies Several previous studies analyzing collective traumatic memory in the Baltic states during the Soviet period have explored the role of women and gender. A gender lens has been applied several times to study the experiences of Baltic women deported to Siberia. Carrying Linda's Stones , an anthology of the life stories of five Estonian women who were deported to Siberia attempts to show 'the results of centuries of foreign invasions and the resulting rule over a small nation' (Lie et al. 2007, p. 20). In this case, the editors give the following reasons for applying a gender perspective to study traumatic memories: 'We have chosen to focus on women because the majority of life stories written about World War II and its aftermath were published by men who often have a different perspective .... Women's and men's lives differed considerably during this period. Women's stories not only concentrate on themselves, but on broader family relations' (Lie et al. 2007, pp. 20-21). A collection of biographical essays compiled by Ona Voveriené (2005) embraces a similar essentialist perspective on gender, setting out to tell the story of 'the most famous Lithuanian women who suffered a tragic fate' (Voveriené 2005, p. 5). Hinrikus and Koresaar (2005, pp. 22-23) outlined several other reasons why there is a need to apply a gender perspective to the study of traumatic memory in the Baltics in general, and to the narratives of the survivors in particular. Gender-sensitive perspectives compel researchers to pay attention to women's bodies and women's issues, such as infertility, single motherhood, and the death of children, issues that tend to be omitted from mainstream historical perspectives. Thus, gender perspectives help to produce a more nuanced understanding of life histories written</page><page sequence="6">336 JOURNAL OF BALTIC STUDIES by the former deportees, and thereby enrich the study of social ('collected') and cultural memory. Stories told by women and analyzed from a gender perspective not only enrich national meta-narratives, they can transform these national meta-narrati ves as well. In her analysis of Dalia Grinkeviciûté's Lietuviai prie Laptevii jūros (Lithuanians by the Laptev Sea), which is probably the best-known Lithuanian deportation story, Violeta Davoliutè (2005, p. 52) suggests that Grinkeviciûtè put forward two competing visions: 'a collective narrative of national liberation, and an equally heroic narrative of individual resistance' . For Davoliutè, this book, which was of crucial importance during the period of national rebirth in Lithuania, represents a perspective which is fundamentally different from 'the irredentist, ethnocentric historical consciousness' usually associated with deportee memoirs in Lithuania. Similarly, Renata Bernotiené's Tremtinès Onos istorija (The Story of Ona, a Deportee), an account of the experiences of the author's grandmother which became quite popular in Lithuania last year, abandons the heroic 'fighting and suffering' narrative typical of the post-war period for a more individual, moving and personal narrative, thus decentralizing traumatic history. In Baltic studies, gender perspectives have been applied, by and large, to interpret the memoirs of deportees. Analyzing the strategies and experiences of the former deportees as agents with power to shape political community challenges the reification of the category of 'women survivors' as voiceless victims, thus resisting the temptation to essentialize women's experiences. As a matter of fact, studies of gendered memory suggest that there is an undeniable temptation to essentialize women's experiences and portray them as victims because, in the words of Ronit Lentin, 'Women are strategically positioned as carriers of the collective's honor and shame...'. At the same time, 'Women survivors embody and symbolize the collective and carry greater responsibility for transgressing group boundaries, both symbolically and materially' (Lentin 2006, p. 473). Being associated with the 'collective' (i.e., the nation) suggests that there may be a strong rational incentive for successful agents of memory to use 'victimized womanhood' to gain political capital as well as to pursue laudable political goals. However, other incentives, such as gaining recognition for a certain version of a meta-narrative and /or pursuing group interests, may be equally strong. The Interviews The MPs Vincè Vaidevutè Margevicienè, Vida Marija Cigrejiené and Dalia Teišerskyté are among the most influential agents of memory in post-Soviet Lithuania. They are also high-profile politicians who have gained considerable influence in the current political climate, which is dominated by the conservatives. Margevicienè is a leading conservative politician and 'heir' to Povilas Jakučionis, a former Chairman of the Political Prisoners, a political party made up of former deportees and political prisoners.3 Born in 1949 in Irkutsk, Siberia, she resettled to Lithuania in 1960. She started her political career in the local government in Kaunas in 1995 and was elected to parliament in 2004. Before starting her career in politics, Margevicienè worked</page><page sequence="7">WOMEN 'AGENTS OF MEMORY' IN POST-SOVIET LITHUANIA 337 as a medical doctor. Cigrejienè 's biography is somewhat similar. Like Margevičiené, she worked as a medical doctor in Soviet Lithuania, is a conservative politician and was elected to parliament in 2004. Cigrejienè was born in 1936 in Kaunas, and was deported to Siberia (to Barnaul) in 1941, returning to Lithuania in 1948. Thus, she spent considerably less time in exile than Margevičiené. Born in 1944, Teišerskyté was deported relatively late to Irkutsk (1953), during one of the last waves of deportation. She returned to Lithuania in 1962. Her formal education is in journalism. Teišerskyté was politically active during the period of national rebirth in the late 1 980s and early 1990s. She started her political career earlier than either Margevičiené or Cigrejienè and was elected to parliament already in 2000. Differently from Margevičiené and Cigrejienè, she is not a member of Homeland Union. Since 1999 she has chosen to associate herself with the Liberals, which tends to embrace libertarian political ideology. The interviews conducted with these women members of parliament and the members of Laptevieciai were based on two main themes: (1) their traumatic experiences and the ways in which they remember them, and (2) their views of the institutionalized portrayal of the traumatic aspects of the Soviet past, especially the mass deportations that took place under Stalin. In the case of the MPs, I was also interested in the reasons why they decided to enter politics, as well as in their political actions as agents of memory, including the aspect of duty discussed before. In the case of the members of Laptevieciai , I also tried to find out about their views on Lithuania's political elite, including the leading agents of memory. During the interviews, I attempted to exercise minimum control over the responses; my goal was to get the women 4 to open up and express themselves in their own terms, and at their own pace' (Bernard 1995, p. 209). In the interviews all five women acknowledged a relationship between their experience of past trauma and their decisions to become politically active. Admittedly, there were significant differences in the ways in which the role of the past was described. The sections that follow will highlight the main common themes of the interviews, capture the most common images that the former deportees use to describe the experience of exile and homeland, document their views about the leading national meta- narrative about collective trauma, as well as attempt to delineate the relationship between individual memories and political activism. Remembering the Trauma of Exile: Siberia as a Source of Empowerment In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the avalanche of memoirs of former deportees and victims of political repression created a meta-narrative of the 'fighting and suffering' nation. According to this meta-narrative, the experience of deportation to Siberia was equal to the 'death' of the nation, an act of genocide, an attempt by the colonial power (the USSR) to eradicate rebellious 'elements' (for example, the members of the intelligentsia in the Baltic nations). My joint interview with Zinaida</page><page sequence="8">338 JOURNAL OF BALTIC STUDIES Jakimavičiené and Jūlija Péžaité about their traumatic experiences is an example of how this narrative is reflected in individual stories: Zinaida : [Beginning] in June 1941, sometime in late June, we were transported for almost three months. Many different means of transportation were used. Julija : We were transported by the Angara river ... it is difficult to remember all these rivers . . . We found ourselves in Altai, close to the river Ob. Zinaida : Oh . . . how many children died there, how many children! Julija : Let me show you the pictures of dead children . . . Almost half of all children [deported from Lithuania] died there, in Altai . . . These photographs are very rare; of course, it was difficult to take pictures in Siberia. Zinaida : You know, the remaining photographs are only of the daughter of General Raštikis. Everyone respected Raštikis so much, so we tried to have an honorable funeral for his daughter. Later, no one would care. Children kept dying. At the same time, men were separated from women. Women were left alone with little children - young, beautiful women with children. [Zinaida showed me a photograph of some undernourished children.] The children are dying of hunger. Several points made by the former deportees, such as the separation of the women from the men and the large number of children who died, were used as evidence to make the case that the Soviet deportations of 1941 should be described as 'genocide' against the Lithuanian nation. In this context, Zinaida s and Jūlijas stories followed the structure of the political meta-narrative created during the years of the national rebirth. Later, to re -iterate the point that it was difficult to keep their individual memories straight, Julija started referring to Dalia Grinkeviciûtè's iconic memoir Lietuviai prie Laptevii jüros (Lithuanians by the Laptev Sea). 'Our experiences were described very effectively by Grinkeviciûté. There is little that we can add to her story. The dark and the cold . . . the Arctic night . . . windows made of ice . . . being isolated from the rest of the world/ Interestingly, the narratives of the agents of memory use a different image of Siberia. This experience is the foundation of strength, of empowerment; it's the reason why the agents of memory are able to be brave and tell the truth in different circumstances. This perspective on Siberia as a source of empowerment is probably best seen in Dalia Teišerskytés narrative: We were deported during the last wave of deportations, in 1953, before the death of Stalin. This time, we were deported not in cattle cars, but together with criminals. So my trip to Siberia was a journey together with criminals - visits to many prisons - Chelyabinsk, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, and so on. We were transported to the prisons, then we would stay in one place [close to the prisons] for up to ten days, and then we would go on. The final destination was Mezhdugranka village in Irkutsk region. There were four of us: three small</page><page sequence="9">WOMEN 'AGENTS OF MEMORY' IN POST-SOVIET LITHUANIA 339 children and a grandmother. I was only eight. We were not even going to school yet. (...) I grew up in that village, cutting wood in the forest during the summer and during the winter. We worked on making a road. We called it ledyanka , ťthe ice road'. The road was long, about twenty or thirty kilometers. The tractor would drop you off, and your job was to make sure that the ledyanka was as smooth as a mirror. This was my job: to stay in the cold by myself and keep that road smooth. According to Teišerskyté, her experiences in Siberia helped her to develop what she called sibirietiškas durnumas , 'Siberian craziness', which allowed her to become involved in dangerous anti -Soviet activities later on. As a journalism student at Vilnius University, she, together with other 'daring women from Kaunas', listened to her journalism professors talk about the Chronicle of the Catholic Church of Lithuania , an underground publication, and 'true' Lithuanian history. In 1988-1990, during the initial years of the national rebirth, her Siberian craziness inspired Teišerskyté to organize exhibitions of experimental art in Kaunas and to found a theater company that put on politically daring fashion shows and spoken word performances. The fashion shows were politically daring because the models wore clothes made of bright red, yellow and green materials - the colors of the Lithuanian national flag. Similarly, Margevičiené 's narrative depicts the Siberian experience as a source of empowerment, as something that 'made her tough'. Several times during my interview with her, Margevičiené repeated that she had been born in a train on the way to Siberia in 1949, her pregnant mother having been deported together with her father who was a famous Lithuanian doctor. Margevičiené 's narrative highlighted both the freedom as well as the many material challenges in Siberia: We, children, had a lot of freedom in Siberia. No one could supervise us closely. Our mother worked all day long. We somehow knew that we would have to bring some coal to keep the family warm at night. (...) Little potatoes were especially tasty. I can also remember this huge dill, like trees in Siberia, as well as pickles. Since water was cold in the barracks, sometimes we had to use a spade to take the pickles out of the frozen water. This life appeared to be 'normal' to us. We did not know a different life . . . Ice, or more specifically an icy street, is a recurring metaphor in Margevičiené 's narrative as well: This memory is from the time when I was twelve. I remember eight barracks. There was a huge pile of dirt in front of these barracks. During the winter, this dirt was frozen. Close to it there was a water pump, and we all got water from that pump. Thus, during the wintertime, this area was very smooth . . . This location was known as pereulok khrustalnji , 'crystal street'. We all knew that we lived in the neighborhood known as 'crystal street'. To me, two words, khrustalnyi and Khrushchev, will always remain related. [It was during Khrushchev's time in office that Margevičiené and her family were allowed to return to Lithuania.] My mother used to tell me 'always remember where you have lived, on what</page><page sequence="10">340 JOURNAL OF BALTIC STUDIES street'. And she used to tell me 'sometime in the future, your biography will have the following entry, 'a crystal street' and no one will have to know that it was a pile of dirt. Although Margeviciené's narrative is not as explicit about her experience in exile serving as a source of empowerment, the 'crystal street' metaphor allows her to transform her experience of oppression and humiliation into something that could potentially be a source of pride. The Siberia experience made her want to succeed in her educational pursuits later in her life, when she returned to Soviet Lithuania: 'of course, it was very difficult [in Soviet Lithuania]. However, I was fully convinced that I had no other choice but to study and try to enter the university. Simply put, there was no other option'. Having lived on 'a crystal street' helped her to develop this sense of duty and determination. Cigrejienè's narrative is concise and much less emotional that those presented by Margevičiené and Teiserskytè: Yes, we [my family and I] were deported as well, and the trip to Siberia was unbearably long . . . We were dropped off in the barracks. From what I understand, our mother had a very hard time bringing us up at that time. (...) We were not allowed to take anything with us. We were deported from Alytus. My mother was able to take her golden watch with her, and later she was able to sell her golden watch for a bucket of potatoes. We were able to survive because of these potatoes, you know. The land was very fertile. We were able to survive by sharing the potatoes. (...) There were approximately forty people in our village, most died. Maybe between eight and twelve survived. I do not remember exactly at this point . . . My mother worked on different projects. All the time, we were afraid to be deported to the Laptev Sea, you know. But fate was good to us. We were never deported to the Laptev Sea. It is probably because my father was a literate, and he continued to write letters to different important government authorities . . . As a child, I was very aggressive. (...) The local residents thought that we were bandits. I wanted to strangle those little Russians . . . Yes, they thought that these evil Lithuanians were killing their animals. For example, if a cow died, then the local residents would look for a needle in its stomach, thinking that the Lithuanians must have put one there. This is how it was, you know. Perhaps this Russian experience made my character stronger. I have experienced many difficulties in my life. This made me persevere in my life . . . [After returning to Lithuania,] I graduated from a secondary school in Utena, learned to speak Lithuanian very well, graduated with a gold medal from high school, then I was able to enter the medical college. Of course, I hid some biographical details . . . [such as being related to Adolfas Sapoka, a prominent Lithuanian historian]. No one was able to hurt me in my life. I continued to go forward, you know (...) When times were hard, I remembered children dying, and how their little bodies were thrown out of the windows [of the trains]. This is a vague memory - little bodies being thrown out of the windows . . . But somehow, in the end, we were able to become hardcore patriots.</page><page sequence="11">WOMEN 'AGENTS OF MEMORY' IN POST-SOVIET LITHUANIA 341 Images of Lithuania: Dark and Unwelcoming Compared to Siberia V For agents of memory, becoming a 'hardcore patriot', to use Cigrejiené's phrase, did not automatically translate into an unconditional love of Lithuania. Their narratives point to another common theme: although it was possible to be fiercely patriotic in exile in Siberia - much more so, in fact, than in Soviet Lithuania - they were tempted to escape from their 'real' homeland after returning from exile. This was true both during Soviet times, after they had returned from Siberia, and during post- Soviet times, after Lithuania had regained its independence. During Soviet times, according to the interviewees, many social interactions in Lithuania were poisoned by the knowledge that they were different, somewhat lesser human beings than those who had not been deported. Marge vičiené s narrative is very critical of Lithuania, both Soviet and post-Soviet. She emphasizes how much she learned about Lithuania and its culture while in exile: I had books (...) about Lithuania. I learned to read the poems of Brazdžionis [a patriotic Lithuanian poet] first, and only later did I learn how to cross myself. I knew all of the poems written by Brazdžionis by heart. Every evening started out like this: remembering that the Nemunas [the main river in Lithuania] was the father of the rivers, that [in Kaunas] there was a beautiful state theater and a house for officers [Marge vičiené 's father was a military officer] (...) My mother had a beautiful voice, and she sang excerpts from operas. When Marge vičiené was able to return to Lithuania and see her 'real' homeland, however, she was bitterly disappointed: If you had lived close to the Angara [a river in Siberia] when you saw the Nemunas, ťthe father of the rivers', you would have experienced a shock (...) I realized that this 'father of the rivers', the Nemunas, was dirty. The houses and buildings around it were so shabby. Later, as we came closer to the state theater, the building was so small. It was nothing compared to the house of culture in the city of Tcherenkov, where I had lived in Siberia! Teišerskyté describes an extremely strong, overwhelming feeling of patriotism experienced in Siberia: I remember when a priest came to Siberia for the very first time and held mass. We removed the walls inside of our barracks so that everyone could participate in the mass. This was after Stalin's death. I was chosen to read the poem 'Kur upés teka' (Where Rivers Flow, a well-known patriotic Lithuanian poem). And I fainted - fainted from being overwhelmed by very strong emotions. Only now am I beginning to understand why I fainted. It was because everyone else had put so much faith in me. It was because I had been trusted to read a Lithuanian poem close to the altar. This was too much for me to deal with. Both Marge vičiené and Teišerskyté have somewhat idealized, positive images of Siberia. Teišerskyté told us that in Siberia she was forced to work in a group with men.</page><page sequence="12">342 JOURNAL OF BALTIC STUDIES I was fourteen, but I used to tell people that I was eighteen because I was ashamed of my age. Anything could have happened. They [the men] were drinking, cursing, messing around with the other women. But me, I was known as the 'little angel'. I felt safe there . . . After returning to Soviet Lithuania, Teiserskytè lost this sense of security. For whatever reasons, she felt a strong urge to join the police and somehow 'redeem the sins' of 'the traitors', her parents. Teiserskytè explained that she ended up going to a police station in Kaunas and telling the police that she wanted to become an informant. The police officers, however, thought that she was not suited for the job, and told her to go home. Marge vičiené also explained that she felt strangely out of place in Soviet Lithuania. During their first week in Lithuania, she and one of her friends, also a former deportee, decided that they had to return to Siberia. They took the first bus that they could find. Unfortunately, the driver asked them who they were and where they were going. Of course, this was the end of their adventure, as they ended up in a police station and were later returned to their parents. 'My mother was happy to be back in Lithuania, but that was not the way I felt'. Interestingly, the former deportees Zinaida Jakimavičiené and Julija Péžaité communicated similarly dark images of Soviet Lithuania: Zinaida : There was nothing great about coming back to Soviet Lithuania. It was difficult to obtain a residence permit. Without one, it was difficult to find employment. We were luckier than our father who had to stay five more years in exile . . . Julija : When our father returned to Lithuania, he had a nervous breakdown. He had to spend time in the hospital. There, he discussed politics with someone. When he was leaving the hospital, this Russian [the man with whom he had discussed politics] showed him a 'red ticket' [indicating that he was a police informant]. For our father, this meant that he would be arrested again. Zinaida : For our father, this meant that he was going to lose his house again, that all of his family members were going to be beggars once again. He simply could not take it; he left us in the evening and jumped from a bridge. This is what happened. Julija : Yes, our father lasted for only one year in Soviet Lithuania . . . We started to work. This helped us to survive and believe in life. Zinaida mentioned a private gathering during Soviet times that commemorated their experience of being deported: In 1981 it was the fortieth anniversary of [our] deportation. We had a big house, so we invited people from all over Lithuania. We had a celebration. We invited a musician, and he played for us. Vaitkevičius [the musician] came, and played the accordion for us. We danced. We remembered those times. First we stood up and sang the national anthem of Lithuania. Vaitkevičius was worried: 'Dear god, what will happen now'. He thought that we would all get arrested. We told him not to worry. We are all deportees here. Who could betray us?</page><page sequence="13">WOMEN 'AGENTS OF MEMORY' IN POST-SOVIET LITHUANIA 343 She, as well as the other interviewees, could only share their memories of deportation publicly during the period of national revival. In Soviet Lithuania the low socio-economic status of the former deportees and discrimination against them in social relations were constant reminders of the years spent in forced exile. Margevicienè described the humiliation that she experienced after her return to Soviet Lithuania. To many people, we [the former deportees] were awful, since we wore shabby clothes, were constantly hungry, barefoot, and were always in need of something. We had to get public assistance. After twelve years, we came back [from Siberia] with nothing. Margevicienè explained that she will never forget one of the most humiliating experiences of her life, which took place in middle school. One of her well-to-do classmates invited her and her cousin to a beautiful house in Antakalnis, a Vilnius district that in Soviet times was inhabited by the intelligentsia. They were led into a room with some parrots and were offered some walnuts to snack on. Margevicienè and her cousin, however, noticed a dish with sunflower seeds and started eating them instead. The parents of her classmate were horrified. They reported her to her teacher, complaining that she was not well-behaved. Unfortunately, she and her cousin had developed a taste for sunflower seeds - parrot food - during their time in Siberia. Margevicienè remembers that her teachers in Vilnius wanted to send her to a special school to 'tame' her, but her mother resisted. Clearly, Margevicienè cannot forget the humiliation that she experienced in her childhood, and she compares this with the way former deportees and political prisoners are treated in Lithuania today. Society continues to treat us differently. 'Who are these people? What do they want? Why are they making all these unreasonable demands? Why do they want to outlaw Soviet symbols? What is all this? ( . . . )' We have returned home. We are in our own land. But, for whatever reason, we are not given the right to live in a 'normal' way. She pointed out that it is difficult for the victims of political repression to get affordable mental healthcare, and that they are shunned in capitalist democratic society which is preoccupied with consumption and pleasure. Yes, we need young, good looking and energetic people. But what is the fault of those people who came back [from deportation] as invalids? Look at me . . . Why do I have to cry when I remember all this? [starts to cry] Her status as someone who had to be supported by the state during Soviet times was especially humiliating for her: 'The thieves (the Soviet authorities) decided that I needed public assistance'. Margevicienè tried to describe what many former deportees feel when they have to ask for support from the state, such as pensions. Their possessions were taken away by the Soviet authorities, and now in their old age, they are reduced to asking the government for help. Although social and welfare programs for the victims of political repression are limited, even the existing ones do not receive the wholehearted support from the</page><page sequence="14">344 JOURNAL OF BALTIC STUDIES public. For example, in April of 2008, Aušra Maldeikiené, a popular journalist and social critic, published an article titled 'Is it worth it to make suffering into banal gain?' (Maldeikiené 2008). In this article Maldeikiené pointed out that, during the three years that her father spent in exile Siberia (1953-1956), he was able to do quite well financially. He made enough money so that after he returned to Lithuania he was able to build a house in Palanga, a resort on the Baltic Sea. The article suggested that some former deportees are interested in using their status as victims of political repression to obtain economic benefits from the state. Maldeikiené s article was published shortly before my interview with Marge vičiené, and it was clear that she was hurt by it. In addition, all five women lamented the lack of knowledge in modern Lithuania about the post-war period, such as the partisan war that took place against the Soviet Union from 1945 to 1953. In the words of Margevičiené: Our children still learn about post-war history from their grandmothers, not from [their teachers in] school. Their grandmothers will die soon, what will happen then? We will be stuck with Marija Melnik [who was a famous Soviet partisan who fought against the Germans in Lithuania during World War II. Margevičiené deliberately avoided using the Lithuanian version of her name, which is Melnikaité, thus showing her contempt toward her]. Everyone knows who she is. But . . . how many people know anything about a real woman partisan? Could people identify at least one Lithuanian woman partisan, like they could Marija Melnik? Margevičiené and Cigrejiené expressed concern that the exact number of deportees is still unknown and that the official sources (including publications issued by state -supported history institutes) seem to be interested in reporting numbers that many believe are too low. According to Cigrejiené, the state is definitely not going 'in the right direction' to preserve the traumatic memory of deportations: We have still not been told the correct number of [people who were deported in] the 1941 wave of deportation. Sometimes they say that 8,000 people were deported, sometimes twelve, sometimes ten. Where is the truth? During this wave, one quarter of those deported were children, younger than sixteen. This was a real tragedy. The Duty of Memory? Margevičiené s feelings of alienation in Soviet and post-Soviet Lithuania, neither of which fully embraced or welcomed former deportees and political prisoners, is shared by the Laptevietès Zinaida Jakimavičiené and Julija Péžaité, as well as other agents of memory. Aigi Rahi-Tamm (2008, p. 71) describes a similar phenomenon in post-Soviet Estonia: the victims of political repression and their family members think that their history does not receive enough public attention. Does this realization inspire political activism, including the 'duty of memory', that is, a desire to try to represent the interests of those who have shared a similar</page><page sequence="15">WOMEN 'AGENTS OF MEMORY* IN POST-SOVIET LITHUANIA 345 fate? The agents of memory that I interviewed were not entirely comfortable boasting about their entry into local and especially national politics as well as their successful political careers. This may be explained by the fact that pursuing a political career in post-Soviet Lithuania is still associated with personal gain. All of them tried to suggest that their entry into politics and their associations with former deportees and political prisoners was something 'natural', something that 'had to happen'. According to Margevicienè, she simply 'happened to live' close to the place where the former deportees had their club. Margevicienè told them that she was also a former deportee and this fact helped her to gain acceptance. Flying to Irkutsk to help recover the bones of those who had perished in Siberia provided an opportunity for her to get to know other former deportees. The personal relationships that she developed as a result of these contacts helped her to get elected to the local government in Kaunas and later to enter parliament. In her own words, 'I have always been part of the union of deportees and political prisoners. I have never left it'. Cigrejiené 's narrative is very similar. She asserts that she has also been associated with the former deportees 'since time immemorial', asking us to take her life story and life experiences into account. 'I am a deportee. I am a patriot from Kaunas. That is all. This is why I decided to associate myself with the deportees.' According to Cigrejiené, there is little material gain from her involvement in politics; but 'being able to communicate with people who experienced a similar fate, to share your memories, is crucially important'. She admits that she cannot really agree with all of the views and positions supported by the political movement of the former deportees - their radical and uncompromising stance toward Russia being a prime example. However, she did acknowledge her duty to listen to them and, if possible, to help them using her political power. According to Cigrejiené, What other political party can a former deportee choose? I have researched this political party for more than two years (...) whether this political party lives up to my ideals ... If I chose a different political party, then I would feel like I am betraying my homeland, my deportees, you know. Teiserskytè 's path to politics was a bit more complex. Furthermore, unlike Cigrejiené and Margevicienè, she has never fully associated herself with Homeland Union, the party favored by many former deportees and political prisoners. She argued that her political activism can be traced back to the time when she put on a fashion show using the Lithuanian national colors for the outfits. In addition, Teiserskytè highlighted her fascination with the libertarian ideas that were introduced into Lithuania at the time of the national rebirth. 'I never dreamt about going into politics (...) I wanted to succeed in my own business, in my own area of expertise.' Yet, at the same time, according to Teiserskytè, her previous experiences, including forced exile, made it necessary for her to work together with the forces on the political right: 'It's just part of who I am'. Zinaida and Julija also argued that it was 'natural' for them to get involved in politics at the time of Lithuania's national rebirth and to become active among the conservatives, especially after their trips to Siberia to retrieve the bones of deceased family members. According to Zinaida,</page><page sequence="16">346 JOURNAL OF BALTIC STUDIES In 1989 we were not politically active yet. Nevertheless, we went to the North. In 1 989 we spent a whole month in the same area - in the places to which we had been deported. We were looking for our yurt. (...) couldn't find it. We still do not understand how we survived ... No clean water . . . diseases . . . When Atflimimas (national rebirth) came, we were all extremely happy. We attended the many public gatherings . . . listened to the speeches. We could not tear ourselves away from the radio, from the TV. Those days were all so intense . . . We tried to do our regular jobs, such as working in stores, but, at the same time, although we did not assume leadership roles, we tried to be present everywhere . . . Now we consistently support the conservatives. It is very clear to us whom to support . . . We don't really care much about the political parties, we merely want to support Lithuania. Unlike Zinaida and Julija, Cigrejiené, Teišerskyté and Marge vičiené have developed their own strategies to shape the national meta-narrative. Teiserskytè gives speeches on public holidays, such as on 14 June, the Day of Sorrow and Hope, which commemorates the day when the first mass deportations were carried out by the Soviets in 1941 . Her most recent speech, delivered in the Lithuanian Seimas on 14 June 2008, focused on one message: modern Lithuanian society should not forget the past. 'What remains is history as well as memory/ She related how her sister had seen a classmate getting water from a well, both before being deported to Siberia and after her sister had escaped. With this image she emphasized continuity, despite the fact that deportation had radically altered the course of her life and that of many others. Teišerskyté made many references to 'Siberia's natural beauty', thereby appealing to the Lithuanian preoccupation with landscapes and nature. In addition, she used a metaphor that is now an integral part of Lithuania's cultural memory - 'the land of eternal winter'. 'Thousands of graves remain in the land of eternal winter. This soil feeds Siberian birch trees and cedars, mushrooms and vigorous currant shrubs.' Teišerskyté suggested that she started a new life when she came back to Lithuania: 'I came back to Lithuania when I was eighteen. I can say confidently now that I am still very young because I was born when I was eighteen'. At the same time, she made it clear that she cannot escape the past: 'There [in Siberia] is my father's grave. Unfortunately, I do not know exactly where it is, because common graves were used. Later these areas became places where new houses were built'. In several places, Teišerskyté let the audience know that she is 'tough' and has gone through a lot, for example, when she described her long days of work on the road of ice. She concluded with a powerful message for the future: Let's forgive, revive, love, build new homes, raise children, tend gardens, sing, and say nice things to each other! But let's not forget because history will not forgive us. The souls of those who died, were killed, shot or tortured, will not be able to forgive as well. In contrast to Teišerskyté 's lofty rhetoric, Cigrejiené portrays herself as a pragmatic agent of memory, keen to support legislation and policies that would improve the socio-economic status of the victims of political repression. In her laconic style she described her strategies: 'Yes, I try to participate in all of these</page><page sequence="17">WOMEN 'AGENTS OF MEMORY' IN POST-SOVIET LITHUANIA 347 commemorative events . . . the Day of Sorrow and Hope, and so on. Recently I proposed a bill to make sure that the former deportees and political prisoners have pensions'. Proposing this bill in the summer of 2008 took some courage because it was in April of that same year that Aušra Maldeikienè published her article 'Is it worth it to make suffering into banal gain?' Margevicienè 's strategies are more similar to those embraced by Teiserskytè. She is known for her unorthodox ideas about how to commemorate past injustices. For example, she proposed that the Lithuanian Seimas meet on 22 May 2008 at 4:00a.m., the day and time when thousands of Lithuanians were deported during Operation Vesna in 1948. Her proposal was rejected by the other members of parliament. Margevicienè responded to this rejection by asking rhetorically: 'Why not? Why can't our MPs get together at this time for a meeting? There won't be any traffic jams. Why can't our MPs get together for a meeting at the same time when our nation experienced deportations?' (Végelytè 2008, p. 3). Her proposal did receive the support, however, of many former deportees and political prisoners who got together for a public demonstration at 6:00a.m. Many candles were lit to remember those who did not return from Siberia. Although Margevicienè 's proposal was described as 'unreasonable', its form resembles the provocative campaigns that women's rights groups have used to try to highlight issues that do not get a lot of attention in society, such as violence against women. Perhaps this proposal could be described as an example of 'irrational' politics, but, at the same time, it could be seen as a rational move to try to maintain the support of the victims of political repression and to maintain the status of an agent of memory. Conclusion: Common Traits in the Portraits of Women Agents of Memory This paper attempted to present a collective portrait of three 'agents of memory' and contrast their stories with those commonly encountered with less politically active women. Drawing on a series of semi -structured interviews, it outlined the main themes put forward in these relatively 'untamed' narratives recounting the experience of exile. I tried to illustrate how individual memories of trauma (mass deportations) can be transformed into collective (social and political) memory as well as present a portrait of the leading agents of memory in a post-transitional society primarily interested in pleasure and consumption. I focused on three leading agents of memory who have chosen not to hide their individual memories of past trauma, but instead to try to communicate trauma publicly as well as to express solidarity with those who have experienced a similar fate. Both the leading agents of memory as well as the less politically active women expressed their dissatisfaction with the current official strategies to commemorate the trauma of the past, thus suggesting their willingness to be committed to alternative ways to change the national meta-narrative. The detachment of the majority of the public from the traumatic events of the post-war period, the lack of interest in finding out the 'truth' about the deportations, as well as the lack of respect for the former</page><page sequence="18">348 JOURNAL OF BALTIC STUDIES deportees and victims of political repression were noted by all interviewees. In addition, one common theme was a strong 'duty of memory'. This concept is alien (and potentially lethal) to instrumentalist approaches to collective memory which analyze agents of memory with an implicit assumption that political actors are likely to use and abuse memory politics. Consistent with this line of reasoning, focusing on women agents of memory as well as the gendered nature of memory (the narratives tend to focus on the deaths of children and the experiences of family members instead of the suffering of a collective - i.e. the nation) helps to highlight several hypotheses previously articulated in feminist research on memory outside the Baltic context. Specifically, consistent with Lentin's (2006) conclusions, this article suggests that understanding the narratives of women agents of memory underscores the different experiences of women; however, these narratives do not challenge the sovereign power (that is, the independent Lithuanian state) nor do they try to undermine the patriarchal social order. All but one of the interviewees (Dalia Teišerskyté) tried to downplay the role of gender in politics and asked why my project focused specifically on women and their experiences. At the same time, some memory strategies employed in the public sphere (for example, Margevičiené 's attempt to create a commemoration with shared suffering) suggest the use of unorthodox ('feminine'?) political methods. Perhaps the most emancipatory aspect of the presented narratives is the attempt to conceptualize the experience of exile as a source of empowerment at the individual level. However, even though they explore ways to make Lithuanian society pay more attention to the stories of the victims of political repression, the agents of memory do not have enough political muscle to successfully challenge the image of a nation as 'a suffering and fighting' hero with anthropomorphic traits. Thus, their impact is likely to be limited. Notes 1 All of these interviews were conducted in the Lithuanian Seimas (parliament) in Vilnius. The interview with Dalia Teišerskyté took place on 20 May 2008, the interview with Vincé Vaidevuté Margevičiené on 17 June 2008, and the interview with Vida Marija Cigrejienè on 19 June 2008. I would like to thank the journalist Ingrida Végelyté for helping to arrange and conduct the interviews with Margevičiené, Teišerskyté and Cigrejienè. All interviews were carried out in Lithuanian and subsequently translated by the author. 2 The interview with Zinaida Jakimavičiené and Julija Péžaité took place in their home in Vilnius on 20 June 2008. I would like to thank the journalist Inga Junčiené for helping to arrange the interviews. 3 This party, which became part of the ruling Homeland Union- Christian Democrat coalition in 2008, claims to have approximately 40,000 supporters in Lithuania (most, if not all, of them are former deportees /political prisoners or their relatives).</page><page sequence="19">WOMEN 'AGENTS OF MEMORY' IN POST-SOVIET LITHUANIA 349 References Aguilar, P.
