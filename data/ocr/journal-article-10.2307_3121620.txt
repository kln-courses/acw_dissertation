A NEW LOOK AT PIAGET'S THEORY OF CHILDHOOD ARTIFICIALISM AS RELATED TO RELIGIOUS EDUCATION by ELIZABETH ASHTON, School of Education, University of Durham 1. CHILDREN'S CONCEPT FORMATION Quite recently, I paused to give some attention to nine year-old children's art work which was prominently displayed in the form of a frieze and labelled 'God and His Messengers'. The scene was of heaven with God depicted as an old man sitting among the clouds dressed in a long white robe, surrounded by angels playing harps before the gates of heaven. Examined as a piece of children's art work, the frieze was impressive. Certainly, it was carefully put together and the figures neatly painted and attractive to look at. Why, then, did I feel at the time ultimately compelled to use the word 'superficial' when describing it? The most obvious conclusion is that the naive anthropomorphic images displayed in the frieze are ones to be expected from children of such a young age all of whom think of God as some kind of father figure 'up' in heaven. These expectations of children's concept formation have deep roots in Western thought. The more honest thinkers have admitted their uncertainty as to whether children are able to understand material which is beyond their experience. For example, Rousseau is quoted (in Darling, 1985, p. 20) as observing: Sometimes I say children are incapable of reasoning. Sometimes I say they reason cleverly. I must admit that my words are often contradictory, but I do not think there is any contradiction in my ideas. Darling goes on to express Rousseau's view that, while children can understand only what is experienced, they can think with some modicum of success even of non-experienced phenomena. 164</page><page sequence="2">INTERPRETING CHILDREN'S IDEAS Writing two centuries later, and echoing Rousseau's sentiments that the child 'should remain in complete ignorance of those ideas beyond his grasp' (Darling, 1985, p. 21), Goldman (1984) suggested that Biblical material, because of its mostly abstract nature, should be withheld from children until the stage was reached biologically when their abstract reasoning could develop. Because Goldman's claims were backed solidly by the psychology of Piaget, educators of the sixties and seventies were quick to adopt them. After all, they seemed to be grounded in a logical, scientific framework. 2. CHILDREN'S CAPACITY FOR ABSTRACT THOUGHT However, examination of some examples of the primary source material which forms the foundations for Piaget's theory of child development, indicates that pre-school children are possessed of the capacity for abstract thought. Petrovich (1988), for instance, writes: Contrary to Piaget's argument that artificialism is a sui generis childhood phenomenon, because young children cannot conceive of an alternative source of natural objects, the hypothesis advanced in this thesis is that children's judgements about the origin of natural objects reflect an early interest in metaphysical issues. In addition, if one listens to the dialogue of young children at play, it is common for individuals themselves to be symbols of adults whom they are imitating. Thus, a four year-old may be a symbol of mother whilst, in another situation, a young child may represent a whole nation at war! The scientific background of Piaget may be constantly perceived in his writings. Minney (1985, p. 251) has pointed out Piaget's emphasis on biological maturity, but his neglect of environmental and cultural factors when studying child development. And to these omissions, one could add his neglect to take into account the tremendous creative and imaginative capacity with which most young children are possessed. As Petrovich states: Piaget's genetic psychology ought to be more realistically assessed as a theory of limited scope. The development and nature of metaphysical thought cannot be accommodated within its funda- mental tenets. Consequently, researchers of cognitive development ought to be open to alternative theoretical frameworks (1988, p. 346). As early as 1910, Dewey made the following statement in support of young children's ability for reflective thought: 165 @ Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="3">INTERPRETING CHILDREN'S IDEAS At present the notion is current that childhood is almost entirely unreflective - a period of mere sensory, motor and memory development, while adolescence suddenly brings the manifestation of thought and reason ... ... Adolescence is not, however, a synonym for magic ... thinking begins as soon as the baby who has lost the ball that he is playing with begins to foresee the possibility of something not yet existing ... its recovery (1910, p. 65). This enormous creative potential is what is being demonstrated in the replies given to Piaget when he questioned young children about natural phenomena such as clouds and the sun. Piaget's error was his failure to perceive the nature of the children's creative ideas which he mistakenly took to be statements which could be scientifically analysed. This point may be demonstrated by analysis of conversations which he reports as they were being conducted between himself and children (Piaget, 1930, p. 75). What is important to note is the way in which Piaget proceeds, and the type of questions he continually asks: Grand (6) Why does the sun move along? To keep us warm. Is the sun alive? Yes, because it moves along. And the moon, how does it move along? It's God - It's God that does it. Caud (9) Does the sun move or not? It moves by itself. Can it move as fast as it likes? No. Why? It's God. Can the sun see the daylight? Yes, of course it can, as it gives us light. It hides to make the light. (The same explanation is given for the moon - it doesn't come out during the day because during the day the sun comes out). Could the sun not move along by itself, without God? Yes, if it wanted to. Piaget's analyses this conversation as follows: 166 @ Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="4">INTERPRETING CHILDREN'S IDEAS In a word, sun and moon move of their own free will, but their advance is controlled for moral reasons by God or by man (1985, p. 163). Perhaps Piaget was speculating upon whether or not children were able to arrive at scientific explanations for the movements of celestial bodies? It is obvious, however, that a child of six would have to be remarkably scientifically literate to give answers to such questions that would satisfy a scientific mind. This criticism, but from a purely theological standpoint, has also been made of the questioning techniques of Goldman (see Watson, 1987, p. 106). Goldman questioned young children about such Biblical narratives as Moses and the Burning Bush, the Red Sea Crossing and the Temptations of Jesus. But, as Watson, argues: It would need an exceptional theological maturity in a child or adolescent to point out to the questioner that he could not really give any answer to this kind of question in the terms in which it is asked and with all the assumptions it seems to make. If asked a question, most young children will attempt to provide an answer; they may speculate, or even fantasize, before offering an imaginative response, not because they believe what they are saying is literally true, but because fantasy and creative thought is uppermost in their minds and it is natural to them to respond in this way. This creative capacity is illustrated in the following extract which, again, derives from Piaget (1930, p. 75): Nai (412) When you go for a walk in the evening, does the moon stay still? It comes with me, it follows us. Can the moon go where it likes, or is there something that makes it move along? It's me, when I walk. Piaget's analysis suggests that this conversation illustrates the transition of one phase of development to the next, which proceeds imperceptibility. That is, the moon, as described in the earlier part of the discussion, has a mind of its own, whilst later it is under the power of the child himself. It is interesting to compare the child's statements with the following: The rising moon was now displaying her horns for the sixth time, and still the outcome of the struggle hung in the balance (Ovid, pub. 1985, p. 179). 167 ? Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="5">INTERPRETING CHILDREN'S IDEAS If this piece of writing was analysed according to Piaget's Intellectual Stages Theory, Ovid would have been classified as being in Stage One! Of course, as everyone knows Ovid was writing creatively, and the powerful imagery which he used is what gives power to it. In a similar way, there is great creative potential in the mind of the young child who is able to imagine himself in charge of the movements of the moon. There is then no indication in the comments of Piaget of the child's immensely creative thinking: that the moon was with him, and under his control could have provided the adult listener with wonderful opportunities for expanding the child's imaginative capacity and language facility. Regarding religious education, the moon could have been used as a symbol of transcedence which interacted with human beings here on earth. It is possible that this, in fact, is what the child had in mind, but because of limited language facility was unable to express his ideas. It is this mode of thinking within which Wordsworth was operating when he wrote his poem 'The Idiot Boy' which depicts the power of the moon as bringing about a magical cure for a sick person, even though the boy never managed to reach the doctor. Piaget uses these two comments from five year-old children to illustrate the first stage of his theory concerning the content of children's thinking: The clouds do not fall down: Grim (5) ... because they hold, they stick, because God is there and takes hold of it. Stei (5) ... because they stay ... God wants them to stay (Piaget, 1930, p. 74) Because the children are unable to offer scientific explanations, they use their creative ability to offer imaginative ones; knowledge of such scientific terms as 'evaporation' and 'condensation' are alien to their ideas because of lack of scientific knowledge and understanding, but in a creative, theological sense they were probably expressing what was and is true. What Piagetian psychology fails to recognize is the extent to which young children strive to offer answers, even in circumstances when they could not possibly be in positions to provide scientifically accurate information by way of a response. It is this creative energy for imaginative thought that religious education should be attempting to harness in order to help the child develop his/her powers of reflective thought. Petrovich adds weight to this prescription in her observation that: 168 ( Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="6">INTERPRETING CHILDREN'S IDEAS ... there seems to be a congitive disposition towards metaphysics which is manifested in the need for completeness of explanation. The child seems to behave as an empirical metaphysician ... The fact that children postulate some mechanism rather than refusing to speculate about possible causes supports the views mentioned earlier that the belief in causal determinism is a fundamental principle of causal reasoning. This is in agreement with Kant's emphasis on the subjective necessity for our cognition to postulate a transcendent cause. In other words, when the child is asked to answer a question that has no known empirical answer, he is apparently prepared to transcend the empirical realm and postulate a cause in order to have the question answered. Such postulates are plausible, coherent, and permit inferences, all of which criteria apply to both preschool children and adults when examined under the same conditions (1989, p. 341). 3. EDUCATION AND CREATIVE THINKING A while ago I heard the following conversation between two very young sisters whose father had died tragically a week or two earlier. Their mother, it should be noted, had told them their father was in heaven with God. Nicola (4) Last night I was in heaven with our daddy, and God. Claire (7) No, you weren't. You couldn't get up that far. Nicola Yes, I was. My daddy let down a big rope and he pulled me up. This conversation illustrates the points which have been made. Nicola's experience is treated with scorn by her elder sister, Claire. This was not a result of being at a more advanced stage because of being biologically the elder (which would have been the Piagetian analysis), but rather because she was secretly jealous, or even afraid, that her young sister had seen their late father whilst she herself had not. This is why she emphatically denied the experience. Nicola, arguing for herself, and for the validity of her experience, but being unable to factually prove what had happened, may be seen to be fantasizing, or exercising her creative powers to convince her sister of the truth of what she was describing. Children regularly engage in such speculative thought. The following extracts from writing recently done for me by nine year-olds are examples of how their thought patterns revolve: I am puzzled about what will happen when I die. Will I go to heaven or to the devil or will it be automatically the end? I'm 169 ? Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="7">INTERPRETING CHILDREN'S IDEAS puzzled that when I go to sleep I seem to wake up straight away. I wonder about when you die. People say you have a new life but not on earth. I am puzzled when I fall asleep for a few minutes and it has really been for hours. I wonder what happens when you are asleep - what makes you sleepy and what happens to your brain. How do you wake up? What happens when you die? Is there another life after death and if there is what is it like? The point which it is important to make here is that such speculation about life and death issues is not confined to childhood. On the contrary, it constantly engages the mind of adults, not least that of Saint Paul. It was, after all, his creative, spiritual insight which caused him to write the following lines: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for a trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. (1 Corinthians 15, v 51/2.) As Saint Paul recognized, questions concerning life and death represent a great mystery. Perhaps human beings become spiritually dead once speculative thought ceases. Such is the depth of thinking which underlies the comments made by the three children in their writing, rather than being definable merely within a stage of intellectual growth. It is easy to pass over such statements and conversations of children, dismissing them as thoughts typical of childhood, and indeed equally easy to reinforce their imaginative capacity as being something which is believed to be literally true. Education should enable children not to correct their ideas with scientific explanations, but to explore their creative thoughts by helping them apply the ideas symbolically to their own experiences and to those of other people. Watson (1987) has described imagination in these terms: A creative circle needs to be formed in which the passive element of experience, allied with the motivational power of imagination to see possibilities is corrected or reinforced by intellectual reasoning (1987, p. 136) Science is itself creative, depending upon the power to 'see possibilities', to refine processes and to create through interpretation. 170 ? Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="8">INTERPRETING CHILDREN'S IDEAS 4. RELIGIOUS EDUCATION AND CREATIVITY In religious education it is essential that children are helped to see their ideas creatively, rather than remaining in a set mould without any way forward being suggested. This is why the following criticism was made of work such as the frieze which I described in the opening lines of this article: I recently heard a group of nine year-olds talk with some sophistication about rockets and computers and yet they were quite content to draw crude pictures of God as an old man in the skies. No wonder such absurd notions promote the belief that religion has been replaced by science. How can we expect children or adults to think straight about religion on the basis of such ignorance? (Watson, 1987, p. 107) Young children, when thinking creatively, know when they are being imaginative. If their capacities for reflective thinking are to deepen, the elements of imaginative thought should be given full recognition and their thought processes encouraged to speculate further by increased reflection. To return to my original subject, the frieze of 'God and His Messengers'. I suggest that underlying this exercise was the Piagetian assumption that nine year-olds were incapable of producing anything more profound, not having yet proceeded beyond the stage of Concrete Operations. This assumption has tended to let children's ideas remain undeveloped beyond those found in such speeches as that of Nicola quoted above. What is so unacceptable is the commonly found attitude among children towards spiritual questions when they have learnt a little about scientific explanations of the universe: People say when you die you go to heaven, but I don't think so. If you get burnt when you die, you are just a cinder, and when you are buried you rot away and just bones are left (eleven year old). This child's potential for creative thought has remained un- developed and the problem of religious literalism has taken its place. Both God and death itself remain confined to spatial regions. A 'scientific' frame of reference dominates and holds sway. How much more stimulating is the writing of the five year-old who wrote for Piaget: The sun stays away up there because it wants to give us light. Its God that makes it stay up. It doesn't want to come down. It is used to staying in the sky (Piaget, 1930, p. 107). 171 ) Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="9">INTERPRETING CHILDREN'S IDEAS The possibilities of increasing children's capacity for reflective thinking here are immense. Creative work about light and darkness, based upon the experiences of the child and applied explicitly to religious ideas should introduce the popular metaphor of God being Light. To restrict children's ideas within developmental stages is to confine their creative thinking to the rubbish tip, where as best such ideas are examples of amusing childhood novelties, to be discarded upon maturity. The dangers of failing to develop children's creative potential by leaving it to disappear, or to force it into dormancy has been expressed thus: At the present time there is much concern about the lack of response of young people to religious education, or to the spiritual aspects of life ... this situation surely makes the welfare of young people more threatened in the western world than it can ever have been in any other society (Plunkett, 1990, p. 93). It should not be beyond the educational system to stimulate the creative potential of young children to the extent that firm foundations are laid for informed opinion about religion to be possible. It is necessary to stimulate creative thought from the early days of schooling, building upon the young child's rich creative potential. What are worthy of display and admiration are examples of children's work which demonstrate how their creativity has been used to develop their understanding of what is meant by transcendence. Perhaps Nicola was aware of her own transcendence when she felt close to her father. Such experiences defy straight description, being beyond the powers of expression in any medium, by either child or adult. Teachers need to be constantly alert nevertheless, and ready to respond to opportunities to help children refine their ideas and to help them forward in their thinking. In conclusion, I quote from the writing of an eleven year-old who was writing about his experience when watching an eclipse and which he had found to be spiritually exciting: There was a total eclipse of the moon and I felt I had to go to the field to see it. I stayed by myself and yet I was not by myself. I went home feeling really happy. REFERENCES DARLING, J. (1985) Understanding and Religion - Rousseau's 'Emile'.
