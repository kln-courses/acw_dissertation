<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIII.-NEW BOOKS Senvse-Perception and Matter: a Critical Analysis of C. D. Broad's Theory of Perception. By MARTIN LEAN. Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1953. Pp. 217. 21s. MR. LEAN'S purpose in this book is both narrower and wider than its title would suggest. It is narrower in being very much less than a critical analysis of Broad's theory of perception. Apart from some fleeting references to Scientific Thought, the detailed investigation relates entirelv to selected paragraphs of chapter iv of The Mind and its Place in Nature. A generous estimate, giving the fullest allowance for repetition and divagations, would put this at about a tenth of Broad's published work on perception. It is wider in that Mr. Lean intends by his examination of Broad to undermine the entire sense-datum theory. Broad is, for two reasons, a bad choice for an undertaking of this variety. In the first place, his work on perception is more remarkable for comprehensiveness than originality, so that an exposition, to be of any value, must cover his output as a whole. Secondly, the fundamental positions, which it is Mr. Lean's wider purpose to criticise, are less argued for by Broad than by any comparable philosopher (e.g. Russell, Moore, Price, Ayer). What is more, the truth of the sense-datum theory is assumed in the use to which he puts his technical terminology of 'objective constituents ' and so forth. Mr. Lean is aware of this but takes no steps to supplement the doctrines he criticises with the familiar enough arguments for them, which Broad clearly thought adequately secure to be taken for granted. This weakness is emphasised by the fact that Mr. Lean is, via Professor Bouwsma, an admirer of Moore and this, not unprecedentedly, takes the form of an imitation of Moore's literary mannerisms; artificial naivete, reiteration, italics and all. This inflationary technique enables Mr. Lean to spread his material through a two-hundred page book without making any very obvious effort to elicit and understand the reasons for the deviations from ordinary language of the doctrines under discussion. With some solemnity he reveals as the occult source of the sense-datum theorist's dilemma of Humean scepticism and Lockean paradox the fact that " Dr. Broad implicitly regards the ' objective constituent ' as a kind of photographic image which literally has these properties and qualities in the same sense that physical objects do " (p. 206). Since Broad takes considerable pains to prove the doctrine caricatured here it is hardly a triumph of discovery, one does not need an X-ray camera to examine the condition of the skin. Mr. Lean's dialectical resources are somewhat exiguous. Amid a certain amount of rhetoric about the absurdity of the doctrines he is criticising, he relies heavily on the argument that we all know perfectly well what ordinary statements mean and on the polarity argument, that, for example, since we can use the pair ' veridical-delusive ' perfectly well in ordinary life, nothing can follow from the fact that veridical and delusive perceptions are not internally distinguishable. This classing together of veridical and delusive perceptions is Mr. Leall's principal object of criticism throughout the book. A number of argu- ments are brought against it to the effect that it entails the falsity of 546</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS 547 things we know for certain. The force of this rests on a confusion between an expression's being usable or meaningful and the correctness of a type of verbally expressed analysis of its use. This is, in effect, to equate 'common sense ' with naive realism, an intriguing affinity with those well-known absurdity-mongers Hume and Russell. No argument is brought against the contrary view, of, for example, Moore and Schlick, that the sense-datum theory is perfectly compatible with common beliefs. In the introduction Mr. Lean says that Broad is concerned with pseudo- problems, that the dilemma of scepticism and paradox is generated by the sense-datum terminology which has none of the neutrality with which it is credited. The view that ordinary perceptual statements 'mis- represent' the situations they are used to describe is repudiated on the ground that these statements mean just what they were coined to mean. In chapter i the protest against classifying veridical and delusive percep- tions together is made. Philosophers infer that the same sort of entities are to be found in both because the same sort of claim is made in both. Why not class delusive perceptions with reports of one's states of mind instead of with veridical perceptions ? He makes some penetrating criticisms of Broad's conception of sensations, which might have been, but are not, employed against the problematic classification. In chapter ii an argument of Broad's that we cannot really perceive objects since we never perceive their whole spatial, temporal and qualitative extent is efficiently refuted. Mr. Lean shows that the argument is superfluous anyway, since it follows from Broad's definition of what we are directly aware of that it could never be even a part of an object. In chapter iii Broad's view that the world of objects is a hypothetical construction is rejected on the ground that physical objects are that by contrast with which entities are described as hypothetical. Mr. Lean says that Broad does not realise that to replace 'seeing a physical object ' by 'having a succession of visual experiences' is a purely notational manoeuvre. " We may translate freely between " these ways of speaking (p. 104). The polarity argument is reintroduced to deny Broad's contention that, while delusiveness can be, veridicalness can not be conclusively estab- lished. It is held also to show that it is impossible that there should be no physical objects at all and, again, that physical objects should never be identical with the objective constituents of perceptual situations. In chapter iv theories asserting such objective constituents to be literally parts of physical objects (a hope already proved forlorn) are considered. -On this view either objective constituents must appear, like objects, as sometimes other than they are or physical objects must be very different from what we normally take them to be. Mr. Lean sees such doctrines as misleading ways of expressing the truisms that objects present vary- ing appearances and that these variations depend on the condition of observation. In so far as these facts are puzzling they can be perfectly satisfactorily explained by physical optics. Mr. Lean makes the interest- ing point that the variations in the appearances objects present are much exaggerated by philosophers. In chapter v Broad's view that the causally necessary and sufficient condition of objective constituents are located in and around the observer's head (the 'region of projection') is examined. A physical object is a necessary condition of a veridical perception and, therefore, the state of the region of projection cannot be sufficient. The argument (Russell's favourite) that the object and what we actually observe must be different since the velocity of light is finite</page><page sequence="3">548 NEW BOOKS is refuted by the consideration that the simultaneity implied by the common-sense view is too coarse-grained a notion to be incompatible with the minute lapses of time involved in the perception of all but very remote objects. In chapter vi the examples which Broad sees as justi- fying the inference from " this looks " to " something is " are held to fail in view of their being explainable by optics. The so-called ' scientific' theory that objects really have no secondary qualities is briefly but effectively exploded. Broad's view that we can fail to notice some properties of sensa is shown to.involve an insoluble problem Tibout the criterion of a sensum's identity. The fact that very few perceptions are delusive is held to be a reductio ad absurdum of the view that sensa are never identical with objects. This view is also held to be a hypothesis which is unconfirmable in principle since, according to it, we can never observe anything but sensa. The sense-datum theory, which treats all perceptions as if they were hallucinatory, is said to arise from an illegiti- mate transfer of the substance-quality way of speaking from the domain of veridical to that of delusive perception. To Mr. Lean's five principal arguments against the classification together of veridical and delusive perceptions there seem to be insuperable objections. (i) That we can distinguish between them by further inspection would not be denied by most philosophers, the point is that this distinction is not internal but depends on the relations obtaining between a given perception and others, actual or possible. (ii) We can- not 'translate freely' between the experience- and object-notations, inferences from experiences to objects are only valid under certain limiting conditions which philosophers have seen it as their business to specify. (iii) The 'hypothesis' that sensa and objects are different is untestable, but this is not surprising, for, to the sense-datum theorist it is not a hypothesis, any more than the assertion that blushing and embar- rassment are different, but a necessary truth. (iv) That there are few delusive perceptions is no reductio ad absurdum of the sense-datum theory; as long as there are any at all, the conditions obtain for making the crucial classification. (v) To apply the substance-quality way of speaking to delusive perceptions is not an illegitimate move. Unless something more is meant than the employment of both referring and classificatory words in their description, and nothing more is suggested, such a procedure is essential for any description whatever. As for subsidiary topics: Mr. Lean's view that ordinary language cannot misrepresent what it describes misses Broad's point which is that it naturally suggests a type of analysis which is mistaken, but not that it is meaningless. The argument that the world of objects cannot be a hypothesis ignores the fact that objects are contrasted in this respect 'with sense-data. The view that veridicalness cannot be established as conclusively as delusiveness could be defended on the ground of the implicit generality of the former notion. While one unfavourable con- comitant establishes delusiveness, an infinity of favourable ones is required for veridicalness. This is, I think, a mistaken view, but Mr. Lean's reasoning does not show it to be so. His reference to optics is simple ignoratio elenchi. Philosophers have not set out to explasin the appear- ances an object presents but to interpret it in terms of them, to elucidate the logical, not the causal, relations between objects and appearances. Mr. Lean's argument against Broad's theory of the causation of sense-data is irrelevant. He is concerned with the causes of veridical perceptions, Broad with those of perceptions in general.</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS 54-9 There is a rather high proportion of misprints bu-t the only place where the text has gone seriously adrift is in the second sentence on page 164, where even the most sympathetic attempt at reconstruction must be highly speculative. There is no section 4 to chapter ii; it should, I imagine, come before the final paragraph on page 67. A. M. QUINTON. Readings in Ethical Theory. Selected and Edited by WILFRID SELLARS and JOHN HOSPERS. Appleton-Century-Crofts Inc.: New York, 1952. Pp. x + 707. THIS is a companion volume to Feigl and Sellars' Readings in Philosophical Analysis, intended to be used as a source-book in courses and seminars; but a comparison between the two volumes can hardly fail to be un- flattering to Readings in Ethical Theory. This is not because the authors have selected less wisely; on this score I have only two criticisms to make, and these are valid only from the point of view of a British reader. Rather more than half the volume consists of excerpts from books that are in print and in standard use over here, and I think that the available space might have been better used. Moreover, the method of extract- ing chapters sometimes does scant justice to the authors; no one, for example, would get the impression that Sidgwick was a considerable philosopher from reading chapter 3 of the Methods of Ethics in isolation. Secondly, the proportion of space (about three quarters) devoted to British authors seems to me excessive. It may have been difficult to discover work of sufficient merit in American periodicals; but I find the Americans more interesting, if only because they are less dominated by the dogma I refer to below. The unsatisfactory character of the book is a reflection of the unsatis- factory state of the subject. Logic and Epistemology, with which the earlier volume was concerned, have always been regarded as professional, academic subjects, and rightly. But the great philosophers of the past who are known outside the philosophy departments of universities are known primarily as moralists. For every one layman who has read or been influenced by Plato's Sophist there must be a hundred who have read or been influenced by the Republic; the moral and political theories of Hobbes and Locke are widely known; their metaphysical and logical theories not so widely. The reason is that morals and politics are more interesting and important to the layman than logic, metaphysics and epistemology. But this is only true of the moral and political philosophy of the past. Briefly, these philosophers tried to do three separate, but related things. As 'philosophers' they contemplated the rich variety of human nature and experience; as moralists they offered us ideals or rules to live by, and as logicians they tried to make clear the logic of practical discourse, the language that we use in deciding, choosing, ex- horting, advising, praising, commending and so on. They told us about wisdom, courage, temperance, justice, liberality, love and friendship, ambition and covetousness and even about the minor virtues, vices and motives such as wit, boorishness and the desire to please. In so doing they exhibited their wisdom or their folly; they stuck their necks out. About fifty years ago the axe descended. All moral philosophy was said to " rest on a mistake "; almost all philosophers were said to commit something called the 'Naturalistic Fallacy '. It is no more clear to me</page><page sequence="5">550 NEW BOOKS than it is to Mr. Frankena what this fallacy is or whether there is such a fallacy; and I am confident that, if it exists, it is a venial sin which could be removed where it occurs by a little judicious re-writing of the philosophical classics which would leave their main teaching intact. Since this time both the aims and the materials of the moral philosopher have been narrowed down. The first task has been rejected as ' belong- ing to psychology' or as treating of what is 'merely empirical' (as if we could know what men ought to do without knowiing what men are !), and the second is implicitly rejected on the ground that, once the logical confusions and mistakes of the older philosophers have been cleared away, we just know what we ought to do and how we ought to live. (I suspect that the Protestant doctrine that it is easy to know what we ought to do because it is all there for us in the vernacular Bible is among the intellectual ancestors of intuitionism.) There remains the logical task; and here it is the materials that have been narrowed. 'Good', 'Right' and 'Ought' are the only concepts to be examined, and even these are torn from the context of actual human behaviour in which alone they have life. As far as 'good' is concerned, there are only three questions: " What is Goodness ? ", " What does the word 'good' mean?" and "What things are good?" The first two can be answered so shortly that it is surprising that some 400 pages can be devoted to the answers in what is only a selection of the best writing. The answer is that Goodness is a simple, non-natural quality of which 'good ' is the name. As to the third question, no such simple answer is possible; but then, none is needed, since we just see, it is just obvious what is good. It is only fairly recently that philosophers have come to see why this thesis is at once so barren and so impregnable. The question whether goodness is a quality or not (which the intuitionists did not see to be logically prior to the question whether it is a simple or a complex quality) is a logical question, and, as such, cannot be answered by anything akin to 'looking'. And the question whether we know what is good, right or obligatory by means of a special faculty called 'intuition' is also a veiled question about the logic of ethical sentences. It is not a question about the existence of a faculty, but a question about the logical status of these sentences. Are they used for reporting or describing a special kind of data or not ? In this connexion I regret the absence of Mr. Holloway's Ethical Qualities and of Mr. Hart's Knowledge by Acquaintance which, although it is not about ethics, has an important moral for the moralist. Mr. Aiken is, I think, rightly persuaded " that exclusive pre-occupation with the definitions of such individual words as 'good', 'right' and 'duty' is largely responsible for the barrenness and triviality of so many recent works in ethical theory ". But it is Mr. Strawson's Ethical Intuitionism which shows both what is wrong and how it can be put right. For he shows how justice can be done to the core of the anti- naturalist case (which is, I take it, that moral sentences have special roles which cannot be identified with the roles of other sentences and cannot, therefore be translated into other sentences) without " supplementing the facts with a fairy-tale ". Of the section on the Emotive Theory I can only say, somewhat can- tankerously, that in my opinion these matters were better discussed by Hume and Price than by their twentieth-century followers. The last section is devoted to Moral Freedom, Guilt and Responsibility. Mr. H. D. Lewis rightly draws attention to the facts that these concepts</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS 551 have been unduly neglected in recent writing and that no discussion of other ethical subjects, particularly obligation, is complete without them. But when he speaks of the problem of freedom or the problem of guilt it is difficult to understand what, for him, the problem is. The traditional problem of freewill was that of reconciling the belief that all events are 'determined' with the belief that human actions are free. Many attempts, of which those of Mr. A. K. Stout and Mr. Stevenson are included in the volume, have been made to solve this problem by showing that the two beliefs are not, after all, incompatible. I doubt if anyone would regard any of these attempts as wholely satisfactory and for philosophers who take this line many problems remain. But Mr. Lewis is convinced both that freedom and determinism are incompatible and that men are free. How, then, can he have a problem ? Mr. Lewis has much that is interesting to say on guilt; but his treat- ment seems to me darkened by an implicit adherence to the dogmas of the intuitionists. This comes out in his rejection of the view that " a fully satisfactory account of guilt can be given in purely psychological terms " and his complaint that psychological and theological treatments ignore the " properly ethical features " of the problem. But what pre- cisely does a psychologist's account of guilt necessarily leave out ? Such accounts might be criticised in two ways: (a) as being over-simple, omitting important psychological facts or even false. Mr. Lewis does criticise Freud in this way; but it is only in passing and is not his main criticism. (b) We might condemn the psychologist for not telling us under what conditions we ought to hold a man guilty or for not explaining to us the logical connexions between 'free', 'guilty', 'responsible' and so on, as these terms are actually used. But this would only be to criticise him for not sticking to his last, for not being a moralist or logician. Lewis' main criticism seems to rest on a confusion between these two. The psychologist's descriptions are, it seems, necessarily incomplete, as descriptions, because they omit all reference to the moral facts. And this presupposes the standard intuitionist view that the role of moral language is to describe special moral facts and qualities that exist over and above or alongside of the 'empirical' and 'natural' facts. What it is to feel guilty is something that we all know; the minute description and explanation of this feeling are psychologists' tasks; but what it is to be guilty, to deserve blame is not to be discovered by intro- spection and not a psychologist's question. Mr. Paul seems to understand more clearly just why " the question -cannot be finally settled by recourse to the psychologist alone ". It is because the question is not, " What does the psychologist mean when the psychologist thinks of guilt ? ", but " What do we mean when we think of guilt ? " But his paper is all too short; it is more a sign-post towards the light than a beacon itself. In the same section Mr. Hospers forces the philosopher to make up his mind what attitude he is to adopt towards the findings of psycho-analysis, if he does not, ostrich-like, reject them as false. To summarise his position, we must conclude: (a) that in the case of neurotics, the feeling that a man has that he is deliberating and freely deciding what to do is an illusion; for, no matter what goes on in his conscious mind, the out- come has already been decided by the forces that are working out their drama in his unconscious mind. The case-histories he cites are full of anthropomorphic metaphor; and it is surely here that the philosopher with his special understanding of the role of different types of expression,</page><page sequence="7">552 NEW BOOKS descriptions, explanations, analogies, metaphors and so on, could help the psychologist; the broad facts are beyond dispute. The shoe begins to pinch when we are forced to conclude (b) that no sharp line can be drawn between the neurotic and the normal man and (c) that the most rational decisions of the most healthy man may be 'determined' in the same sense that those of the neurotic are determined. These facts do give rise to philosophical problems. For we should normally take as the standard case of a 'free ' choice that in which a normal, healthy man arrives at a decision in a calm, reflective frame of mind and decides to do something, not merely after, but because of the reasons that he has weighed and found good. And we should say that his decision was not really free, but only seemed to be, if we discovered that it depended on unconscious factors of which he was not aware. Mr. Hospers recognizes that, if the psychologists are right, we have two courses open to us. (1) We could retain our old criterion of freedom and say that " a person is free only to the extent that his acts are not un- consciously determined at all ". If we do this, we must go on to say that very few (perhaps none) of the acts we thought free were really free at all. The denotation of 'free act' will become much restricted or vanish altogether. This will, in turn, entail certain changes in our moral thinking. We must, for example, either go on to say blame is seldom (or never) justified or that freedom is no longer a necessary condition of just blame. (2) We could retain the denotation of 'free act' and alter its con- notation. In this case we shall say that " a person's freedom is present in inverse proportion to his neuroticism; in other words, the more his acts are determined by a malevolent unconscious, the less free he is ". It is, of course, difficult to say just what 'malevolent' means here, and Mr. Hospers does not make the mistake of trying to define it. The concept of 'good health ' is not an unworkable one in spite of the fact that no definition could be given of it that was not platitudinous or circular. What is important here is to see that this is a philosophical issue, to be settled, not by assuming that we have a clear idea of what 'free' means and introspecting to discover whether we are free or not, but by con- sidering the rival advantages of adjusting our old concepts to new em- pirical knowledge in two different ways. For my part, I should unLesi- tatingly choose the second course. It seems to me to do little violence to the connotation of 'free', which already allows for the fact that the normal man is free when he thinks he is, while the neurotic is not, and for the fact that, whatever libertarians may say, we do not always allow a man's act to have been unfree if we discover a subconscious motive for it. We are accustomed to changes in the connotations of words (for example, 'heat' and 'energy '), as knowledge increases and to disputes about connotation (e.g. of 'just') between philosophers who would, by and large, agree on the denotation; and the logical liaisons between ' free', ' rational ' and ' responsible ' will remain much what they always were. Others may prefer the more Spinozistic alternative that freedom, as we understand it, is an illusion; but in any case the facts are what they are; why then should we desire to be deceived ? P. H.

SINCE 1935, when Professor Lukasiewicz produced his article 'Zur Geschichte der Aussagenlogik' in Erkenntnis, vol. 5, it has been fairly well known that the Stoics had a system of logic which can be described as a version of the calculus of propositions, though it is a theory of in- ference schemata rather than a theory in which tautologies are derived from other tautologies by the principle of detachment. But until recently there has been no detailed attempt to reconstruct the system. This is not surprising; for the task requires not only a close study of a great many small references scattered through a multitude of ancient authors, most of them hostile, but also an understanding of the various problems involved in formulating a system of logic. When he produced his Ancient Formal Logic Father Bochenski- acknowledged the help he had received from Mr. Benson Mates's unpublished doctoral dissertation on the Logic of the Old Stoa, and it is satisfactory that this has now been printed. AIr. Mates has done his work admirably, and his monograph is likely to remain for a long time the best account of a very interesting chapter in the history of logic. The main divisions of the book are concerned with the Stoic doctrines about (a) signs, (b) propositions, truth, and necessity, (c) propositional connectives, and (d) arguments. But there is also an introduction on the sources and the nature of the problem, and a concluding summary of the evaluations of Stoic logic by historians of philosophy. In addition to the usual bibliography there are two valuable appendi(es, one a series of translations from the most important texts (37 pages in all), and the other a glossary of the Greek words used as technical terms in Stoic logic. In his account of the theory of signs Mr. Mates makes an interesting com- parison between the Stoic oiuatv' evov and Frege's Sinn, and in several other places he finds modern parallels, but in general he avoids the tempta- tion to praise the Stoics with exclamation marks for thinking what we have just thought ourselves. In particular, he does not obscure the peculiarities of the Stoic treatment of propositional connectives by using modern symbolism where it is inappropriate. It would be impossible within the space of a review to summarize Mr. Mates's account of the Stoic achievement for those who have read nothing about it, and I shall, therefore, content myself with mentioning a -few points of special interest in his exposition. Two which seem to me to be excellent are his explanation of what Diodorus (the Megarian) said about conditionals and his emendation of the texts in which the principle of conditionalization is attributed to the Stoics. Both have been treated by him already in articles. On the first point I think he shows conclu- sively that Diodorus did not maintain a theory of strict implication but advanced a queer theory of his own which depends on talking of state- ments as true at some times and false at others. And on the second he shows very convincingly how the texts could have been corrupted. I do not feel so confident, however, about his statement that the five aVavTO86WKTOr attributed to Chrysippus by many ancient authors are not so called because they are the basic patterns from which others may be derived. In this connexion he rightly draws attention to the fact that our best authority, Sextus Empiricus (Adv. Math. viii, 228-229), speaks of deri- vative patterns as non-simple acvaro'aEuK-rot. But most of the contexts</page><page sequence="9">554 NEW BOOKS in which the word is used support the natural interpretation, and he admits that he cannot offer a satisfactory explanation for the Stoic use of the word, which he translates by 'undemonstrated' instead of the usual 'indemonstrable'. Perhaps the source of the trouble is a change of usage. As he remarks, there was apparently some confusion about implication in later Stoic doctrine, and it is at least possible that the word avairO 'cwrot started as a technical term of Chrysippus for his five basic patterns of inference but came to be used in a wider sense after his time. Mr. Mates says correctly that we have no direct evidence for the use of the principle of conditionalization in the proof of derivative schemata. But it seems to me clear that without it Chrysippus could not have obtained the results he is said to have obtained, in particular the pattern later called the consequentia mirabilis. And if we suppose that he did take this course, we can understand easily what otherwise seems very puzzling indeed, namely, why he included among his indemonstrables the schema 'Not both the first and the second; but the first; therefore not the second'. He thought that every inference must have at least two premisses, and so for him the conditionalization of the simplest inference must always yield a statement in which the antecedent is a conjunction of two propositions. But for the purpose of new inference such a con- ditional statement would be useful only as the leading premiss in an argument according to his second indemonstrable (i.e. the pattern later called modus tollendo tollens), where the conclusion would be of the form 'Not both the first and the second'. If this conclusion were to be used in turn as a leadina premiss in further argument, it would be necessary to include among the basic patterns that mentioned above. When I read the article in which Mr. Mates first drew attention to the fact that the Stoics were acquainted with the principle of conditionalization, I tried to construct some derivations in which conditionalizations of the in- demonstrables were admitted as supplementary premisses for arguments in accordance with the indemonstrables, and after playing the game for a little while I had the impression that this was an interesting new way of doing propositional logic. It is perhaps too much to hope that we shall ever find statements of the two missing O4ipara (i.e. principles for the analysis of complex arguments) or any other direct help in reconstruction of the procedure Chrysippus followed in proving the host of theorems with which he is credited by Cicero, but we should be better able to judge the value of our guesses if we could find records of some more theorems, even without their proofs. This is not beyond the bounds of possibility. For apart from later Greek works such as the commentaries on Aristotle and the writings of the Fathers of the Church, there are Arabic texts on philosophy which may still yield new material. Meanwhile in Mr. Mates's book we have a very well documented survey of all the available evidence. WILLIAM KNEALE. Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science. By A. C. CROMBIE. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953. Pp. xii + 370. 35s. DR. CROMBIE has done us a real service. Mediaeval philosophy has for too long been a stamping-ground for theologians, and this has led to the neglect of the epistemology and natural philosophy of the period. No one could suppose that Descartes and Newton, Galileo, Locke and Leibniz</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS 555 were really-after the Greeks-' the first that ever, burst into that silent sea'; but there has been no satisfactory survey of the preceding period to show exactly how the philosophical ground was prepared in which their work germinated. Mediaeval science has not, of course, been neglected; but, as Dr. Crombie remarks, " the most striking changes [in science] are nearly always brought about by new conceptions of scientific procedure ", and the development of these conceptions, which had a dominant influence on European philosophy as well as science, has not been widely understood. In an earlier book, Augustine to Galileo (1952), Dr. Crombie provided an excellent historical survey of the period. Now he follows it up by a detailed and fascinating study of the crucial transitions. Robert Grosseteste of Lincoln (d. 1253) is a key-figure in this develop- ment. The recent rediscovery of Aristotle's writings on natural philo- sophy and scientific method, notably of the Posterior Analytics, was the stimulus of his work; his eminent position in the University of Oxford, of which he was one of the earliest Chancellors (from 1214), gave him an unusual influence; and he made the most of both. Through his disciples at Oxford, of whom Roger Bacon is the best-remembered, he created a tradition of teaching and investigation whose continuation Dr. Crombie traces without difficulty down to Newton's time. Through his connexions with Paris he was, at the least, a strong influence on Albertus Magnus, from whom sprang the corresponding tradition on the Continent. It is the great merit of Dr. Crombie's book that he lets the facts about the period speak for themselves. Though he has a thesis to establish, namely, that the work of Grosseteste's Oxford school " in fact marks the beginning of the modern tradition of experimental science ", he does not harp on it. Nor does he need to, for the evidence he can produce is impressive. Some may not feel that it is conclusive: even on his own evidence one does not find single-minded reliance on the experimental method before the seventeenth century, and much of Grosseteste's Metaphysics of Light is decidedly odd-for him and some of his followers, " the physical science of optics became a method of arriving at a sort of analogical knowledge of spiritual reality and truth ". Certain important conclusions, however, Crombie establishes past question: for instance, the continuity of optics from Aristotle, Euclid and Ptolemy through Grosseteste, Witelo and Theodoric of Freiburg to Descartes, Snell and Newton. Newton was thus only the latest in a long series of philosophers to experiment on, and theorise about, the production of the rainbow. Descartes and Kepler likewise are not idly labelled 'neo-Platonists ', for their views on the role of mathematics in natural philosophy have a clearly visible ancestry: Crombie does well to remind us how far the problem of universals and the doctrine of 'forms ' have always been bound up with the question, how tensed, temporal, 'transitory ' facts could be explained in terms of tenseless, timeless, ' eternal ' mathematical principles. In all this the influence of the Posterior Analytics is evident. Mediaeval studies in the logic of science commonly took the form of commentaries on this work, and it is exciting to find what good use Grosseteste makes of it-especially of Aristotle's distinction between ro' to-rt and ro 0d7, that is, between explanation and demonstration, between 'the reason ' and 'the fact '. One only regrets that Crombie does not allow himself to be more adventurous in his translating, for some of Grosseteste's most penetrating insights are blunted in the process. To give one instance: it is only too easy to forget that the heart of a science lies not in its</page><page sequence="11">556 NEW BOOKS mathematical part so much as in the use of this mathematics to explain observable or demonstrable phenomena-so that "the physics is not in the formulae '. This I take to be what Grosseteste is reminding us in the passage quoted here (p. 93) in the words, " For this reason mathe- maticians very often know the reason for a conclusion of an inferior science, but they do not know the fact, because they do not know the cause of the conclusion in itself but in the universal and from the mathematical aspect ". Surely one could give a more forcible idea of Grosseteste's sense without departing too far from a word-for-word trans- lation ? I suggest, for instance: " Mathematicians as a result are often able to explain a discovery in one of the physical sciences, while yet being unable to demonstrate the phenomenon, since they do not know the physical conditions necessary for its occurrence, understanding it rather from the theoretival and mathematical points of view alone." - Still, one thing in this admirable book raises serious philosophical difficulties: see, e.g., the concluding paragraph of all. Dr. Crombie, having traced the transformation of Grosseteste's ideas into the 'mathe- matical and experimental philosophy' of the Newtonians, adds: "A scientific theory, then, tells us no more than it appears to tell us about the experimental facts, namely that they can be related in a particular manner. It can provide no grounds for the belief that the entities postulated for the purposes of the theory actually exist. So, whether or not science makes metaphysical assumptions, a scientific theory has no metaphysical implications . . . ." Now it is true that for modern scientists gravity, force, atoms and the like are no longer thought of as Aristotelian 'substantial forms' with a grand Ontological status. But why should plain, down-to-earth existence be limited to such 'forms' ? Scientists certainly claim the right to distinguish, on experimental not metaphysical grounds, between those theoretical entities which actually exist and those which are only fictions. It is true, too, that the philo- sophical implications of scientific theories are often exaggerated; but one can hardly allow what Crombie ends by claiming, viz. that meta- physics, ethics, aesthetics and theology alike are immune in principle from any such influence. STEPHEN TOULMIN. Social Psychology. By Professor W. J. H. SPROTT. Methuen. 20s. THIS book has an introduction and three main sections. The first section is headed " The study of groups ", and deals with subjects such as crowds, leadership, and public opinion. The second, " The individual and society ", is concerned chiefly with the social and cultural influences at work in the development of personality. The third, " Applications ", examines briefly how the techniques of social psychology have been used in-industry, in medicine, and in the study of delinquency. A large amount of evidence has been collected-the index contains the names of about 320 investigators-and Professor Sprott's own assessments and comments are incisive and exactly to the point. Of the many inter- esting lines of investigation only a few can be touched on here. One of the most important is that which combines anthropological research with psycho-analytic theory. The book lays stress on the recent tendency to reject the Freudian doctrine of universally existing " instincts ", and to move towards the view which, in its extreme form, holds that " the</page><page sequence="12">NEW B300KS 557 organism itself, conscious and unconscious, ego, super-ego, and all, are what they are because of the cultures in whieh they have developed " (p. xi). It may well-be that the father of the family was a far more formidable figure in central Europe in Freud's early days than he is in our own com- munity at present; and it is possible, as has been suggested by the anthro- pologists, that at least some features of the so-called " Oedipus situation ", are not universal, but are the product of the way of life in particular communities. The social importance of psycho-analytic theory is brought out in a number of other ways. Professor Sprott notes, for instance, how " undercurrents of desire and guilt " influence our attitude towards the punishment of lawbreakers, and how people oppose the systematic study of delinquency and continue to demand severe but useless penalties with an irrationality which certainly needs explaining. The contributions of Marx (pp. 204-211) are discussed more briefly than those of Freud, but in a thoroughly interesting way. " The method of child-training is bound to condition what one might call the specific quality of the society. And, per contra, the economically conditioned factors will clearly influence the methods of child-training. There is in fact a complex interaction through- out. One cannot say that capitalism causes children to be brought up in a certain way, but one can say that the way in which they have tradi- tionally been brought up will condition the 'quality ' of the capitalism, while the individualistic ethic of capitalism may have its effect in stressing competition as an instrument of training " (p. 210). Among other points of partictular interest may be mentioned: (1) The emphasis which Professor Sprott lays, in the study of delinquency, on individual case histories. " Broad statistical research . . . is of limited value unless it is combined with an enquiry into the way in which the factors which are brought out by large scale study affect the individual victim " (p. 256). (2) The influence of " stereotypes ". There is a tend- ency for all of us to have a fixed mould or " stereotype " into which certain characters are fitted, " Thus all Jews are wily, all natives are 'like chil- dren ', all Scotsmen are dour, all Chinese inscrutable and, in some circles, all nonconformist grocers put sand in the sugar " (p. 97). These stereo- types are strengthened by cartoons and other means. Many are of a pejorative kind, e.g. " business man " in left wing circles. (3) The intro- duction of fictitious nationalities in an attitude research test. " At one university the Chinese and Arabs were thought less well of than the Pireneans and Danireans, but rather better liked than the Wallonians " (pp. 106-107). (4) Finally, a single sentence on intelligence disposes of about half a century of muddle. " The question 'What is intelligence ? ' is a misleading one because it implies that intelligence is a thing like the liver or the pineal gland " (p. 138). There are no fixed criteria for deciding what is a helpful " model " Professor Sprott makes free use of this somewhat overworked word-nor for recognising interesting discoveries; and it is difficult in a book of this sort to know what to discuss and what to exclude. Some experiments have all the fagade of scientific respectability, graphs, statistical tables, control groups, expensive recording apparatus, and so on, and yet are almost useless, while, on the other hand, at least one revolutionary theory, psycho-analysis, has no such paraphernalia, and even appears to contradict the laws of logic. Possibly Professor Sprott has erred on the side of generosity in what he has included. Lewin's " topological psychology ", for instance, with its formidable symbolism, receives kinder treatment than the present reviewer would be disposed to give it. But even here</page><page sequence="13">558 NEW BOOXS Professor Sprott is under no illusions. " The real defect is that from the symbols one can infer nothing that cannot be inferred from verbal de- scriptions " (p. 34). He is suitably scathing, too, about the measurement of players' pulse rates during a game of poker, and he quotes without comment the finding that " small-town preachers (weigh) on the average 17 lb. less ... than bishops " (p. 82). About the book as a whole there is one main difficulty. It may perhaps be doubted if Professor Sprott has given adequate justification for sup- posing that " social psychology ". constitutes a single " subject " at all. The introduction attempts to distinguish it both from general psychology and from sociology, but it cannot be said that either distinction is really convincing. The shop labelled " social psychology " sells a remarkable miscellany of goods; and, despite the excellence of Professor Sprott's stocktaking, it is questionable if all these goods should have gone into the same department. The psychologist is by now a prosperous merchant, and he is clearly too well stocked to put all his goods in one shop; but no one, it seems, has made any adequate legislation about how many shops he owns, nor about how his goods can be most conveniently divided among his shops. There are psychologies labelled, for instance, "general ", social ", " experimental '', " educational ", " physiological ", and "child-"; but they are certainly not mutually exclusive, and they qualify the word " psychology " in different ways. If social psychology is a single subject, the contributors to it are a curiously mixed bunch, and include, inter alios, Marx, Freud, Malinowski, Bartlett, Hitler, and Gallup. No one can study social psychology in Professor Sprott's sense without being well versed in other forms of psychology. On the other hand a psychologist interested in the social aspects of intelligence testing (such as Sir Cyril Burt), or in the relevance of psycho-analytic theory to education (such as the late Susan Isaacs) would almost certainly regard it as a waste of time to take part in the administration of questionnaires of the Gallup variety. Yet all these investigations, it seems, are to be classed together as " social psychology ". Admittedly they all deal with what might be called " social situations" ; but such a classification cuts through the middle of perception, intelligence testing, and psycho-analysis, and unites the work of Burt and Isaacs with the Gallup poll. The text itself has few misprints-" motion " in bold type for " emo- tion " on p. 136 is perhaps the most serious-but the index, footnotes, and references have been produced in surprisingly slipshod fashion. Thurstone, Gallup, and Healy sometimes have their names misspelt, Trotter appears as " Tritter " and Pear as " Pea ", Jung is given the wrong initials, Popper's book is referred to as " Open and Closed Societies and their Enemies ", Krech and Crutchfield's book is given several variant titles, the second footnote on p. 173 is meaningless as it stands, and the author himself appears on the title-page as " Professor of Philosophy" and on the paper cover as " Professor of Psychology ". Few readers, however, will question the merits of the book itself; and even those who are not convinced that social psychology has been estab- lished as a genuine science will be fully appreciative of Professor Sprott's achievement. T. R. MILES.</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS 559 La Philosophie de Virginia Woolf. By MAXIME CHASTAING. Presses Universitaires de France, 1951. Pp. 196. Price 500 fr. A NOVEL may, in its own way, communicate a metaphysical view. If it does so, but not in its own way, it is an artistic failure. The philosophy must be consumed in the novel. Mr. Chastaing proposes for himself a double aim: first, that of illustrating, from the work of Virginia Woolf, 'the metaphysical function of the novel'; second, that of philosophical exegesis of these particular novels. So his book is a contribution to the philosophy of art, and to the history of philosophy. It is careful, sensi- tive and sympathetic; it is well written and, on the whole, lucid; and as a literary study of the technique of the novels, even to their punctua- tion, it could scarcely be improved upon. In very bare outline, the argument goes somewhat as follows. In general, description aims at objectivity. Thus, whoever sees a thing necessarily sees it from a point of view, and the point of view he is at determines how it looks to him. But when he tells what he sees, he often uses words which could truthfully be used by another, seeing the thing from a different point of view. (The differences in the way the thing looks should not be thought of as just those due to perspective, in the narrow sense; but also as those which result from the partial con- cealment of the thing by something else; or from the fact that the spectator has been crying, or has the flu.) Furthermore, events in which a number of people are involved may be recounted as if by none of them; as by the biographer, the historian or the recording angel; and this may be so even if the account includes a description of how the events seemed to the participants. Both levels of objectivity characterise the tradi- tional novel. If one asks where, in the space in which the characters move, the novelist is located, no answer is possible; while the characters themselves are on the whole reported as seeing things in the light of common day. Virginia Woolf, in the more original of her novels, takes two steps away from objectivity. First, there is no absolute author's viewpoint: she forgoes the right to be everywhere on her scene, which is also the right to be nowhere in particular. Second-and without this, the first step would simply be the formal trick of a detective novel, of Wilkie Collins or of Browning-the vision of each character is not the objective vision of the active man, but the impressionist vision of the passive, self-conscious spectator. So her novels have the perspective which in ordinary communication is discounted; and it is the perspective, now of one, now of another, of the characters. If the loss of the ordinary vision were total, it would not matter. The solipsist would not describe himself as one. But the loss is necessarily incomplete. This, and its consequences, are illustrated in a small way by the thought that the impressionist picture can be truthfully conveyed only by shock and paradox: the woman seen in the looking-glass is decapitated by its frame. The effect of the perspective vision is like the effect of bombs. 'Sacs, tiroirs, volets, gueules de metro mettent im- pitoyablement a mort des phenomenes.' Other consequences follow. One is the sense of isolation: 'Virginia Woolf, quand elle m'engage dans les 6 perspectives des Vagues, v6rifie les theories des ames- sans portes ni fenetres'. Another is ' l'egalite des objets': all things, seen in the mirror of the mind, assume an equal status. Another is the loss of one's cown identity: ('Pour etre moi, dit Bernard, j'ai besoin de l'eclairage que dispensent les yeux d'autrui '); and the punishment for this dependence:</page><page sequence="15">560 NEW BOOKS Ce qu'ils sont pour les autres les chatie d'avoir voulu 'tre par les autres.' In general, the penalties are: momentariness, chance, absence of design, incoherence; anxiety and absurdity. The novels 'nous sensibilisent a notre monde incoherent'. The way of return to the normal vision is that of action, of work. It is when we'are idle, doing nothing, that we move and mutilate the landscape, and need recognition by others in order to be ourselves. The characters of the novels are spectators, and the whole body of work deserves the title of the last book-Between the Acts., 'Le principe de Perspective exige . . . l'inaction de ceux qui le verifient.' Mr. Chastaing accordingly finds a pragmatic refutation of the philosophy expressed by the novels in the act of their composition by the novelist. The novels possess the form and harmony they deny. The writer, in the act of writing them, shows herself free from that malady contracted from idleness and fear, the purely receptive, reflective consciousness, which has the atomistic and solipsist vision. Mr. Chastaing even gets home to a theological con- clusion; but here, in spite of six views of Percival-Parsifal and one view through Lucy Swithin, one feels that the perspective is his own. Mr. Chastaing places Virginia Woolf where she, no doubt, belongs: in the British empiricist tradition. It is of parts of the metaphysics of Berkeley and Hume that he finds a partial psychological verification in her novels. Yet he also uses the word 'monad' often, and not inappro- priately. Less appropriate seem to me the echoes of contemporary French philosophy. It will be seen that he stresses the losses, rather than the gains, of the perspective vision; and that the way of return he proposes is more exalted and more arduous than Hume's. P. F. STRAWSON. The Sensory Order. An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical Psychology. By F. A. HAYEK. With an Introduction by HEINRICH KLUVER. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1952. Pp. xxii + 209. 18s. PROFESSOR HAYEK explains that the theme of this book was conceived over thirty years ago. The psychology of that period was still largely concerned with the derivation of other psychological processes from sensations, and he, like many others since, was reacting against it. The very title of the book, however, suggests that he is not altogether free from the older tradition. It would better read 'The Perceptual Order', for his concern is not to describe our sensations, but to show how the structure of the phenomenal environment, the way in which we perceive things, corresponds to the structure of events in the organism which perceives it, but not always to the structure of the world as revealed by physics. Roughly, he tries to show that our attribution of properties to things is a result of a classification; we cannot say that a thing has a given property until we have classified it with other things. Much of the middle part of the book gives an account of the sort of mechanism which could carry out various complex types of classification, based ultimately upon the relative frequency with which an impulse set up in the nervous system by a stimulus occurs together with other impulses or with what Professor Hayek calls their 'following'. Much of this account is, I fear, general and even obscure. The language in which it is formulated is not always happy. Despite initial qualifications, Professor Hayek insists on</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS 561 talking of some nervous processes as symbols for or representatives of other processes when he should be concerned with mechanism alone. The theory is of itself, I think, plausible, though it under-emphasises the part played by our interests and needs in coming to ascribe properties to things. We do not always or even generally make all the discriminations of which we are physically capable. I think too, that his appeal to the James- Lange theory of the emotions and Berkeley's theory of space-perception for corroboration is of doubtful value. There are also greater differences between his view and that of the Gestaltists than he allows. The main defects of the book derive from the use of the term 'sensory'. Earlier psychologists such as Mach did talk of sensory elements, confusing sensation and perception. But it is not enough just to deny the existence of such. Professor Hayek's procedure makes him draw certain para- doxical conclusions, e.g. that perception and sensation are similar or the same (Section 3.76) and that we have pre-sensory experience (5.1 ff.). The latter phrase suggests that we have some form of experience different from and more elementary than sensations, but what he means is that we need experience in classifying things in order to perceive them as possess- ing properties. Again, in section 6.37 he says, " The qualities which we attribute to the experienced objects are strictly speaking not properties of that object at all, but a set of relations by which our nervous system classifies them . . ." (cf. too, 1.17, " Much that we believe to know about the external world is, in fact, knowledge about ourselves "). The objec- tive properties of things are those revealed by physics, though he states elsewhere that this is not to say that these are more real. This surely shows an undue respect for physics, and no reason is given why on this account we should be held to be talking of the actual properties of things even here. We have to accept some standard of what it is to attribute a property to something but there is no reason to prefer physics to common-sense in this respect. There is a concluding chapter on philosophical consequences, in which the relevance of the preceding discussion to a variety of philosophical topics is described. But should a scientific theory have such conse- quences ? I think that Professor Hayek has not taken sufficiently seri- ously his statement (1.16, 1.18) that psychology must concern itself with cases where what we claim to see does not correspond to what is to be seen; in consequence he has slipred over into talking epistemology. Indeed his arguments against phenomenalism are largely independent of his initial theory. His epistemology is idealist in character. Having taken science as that which provides true knowledge, he suggests that it is so because it provides the most coherent picture of the world. Indeed he maintains that it aims at a state in which all knowledge is based on tautologies (8.24). It is this, too, which makes him stress so much the fact that it is impossible to explain human activity in every detail. For, to do so we should have to give the relations ketween the organism and everything else, which we could not do unless we were, so to speak, out- side and above it all. But this is a metaphysical puzzle, not a serious problem for science, where the possibility of treating systems as isolable is taken for granted. Professor Hayek also thinks that this point has some bearing on the question of the freedom of the will, but this is scarcely to be claimed with any justification. Where it does not delve into metaphysics, the book raises many interesting questions and the theory that it puts forward is suggestive. It is marred by a partial retention of the tradition from which it seeks 36</page><page sequence="17">562 NEW BOOKS to free us. If ' perceptual ' were written for ' sensory ' throughout it might be much more satisfactory; for in that case it would not be necessary to say anything about sensation. As it is, many paradoxical things are said about it. There is a useful bibliography, but I have noticed many cases in which the dates of references given in footnotes do not correspond to the dates given in the bibliography, and I suspect that there are other inaccuracies in the bibliography itself. D. W. HAMLYN. Butler's Moral Philosophy. By AUSTIN DUNCAN-JONES. Penguin Books, Ltd., 1952. Pp. 192. THERE is no such thing as elementary moral philosophy; hence there is much to be said for introducing the uninitiated by expounding to them the work of a classical author. This is Professor Duncan-Jones's aim in Butler's Moral Philosophy. His book is a good introduction to moral philosophy, an excellent one to Butler. Professor Duncan-Jones's style is c'ear, unassuming-it exhibits a modern preference for the degagA- and economical. He shows a sympathetic appreciation of Butler as a man, clergyman, apologist, and philosopher, but there is much acute, though not captious, criticism of his argument. Though Professor Duncan-Jones professes-it is nowadays almost de rigueur-to be interested in logic, not in morals, and, unplausibly claims that this was Butler's main preoccupation, he is -not lacking in insight and good sense even when he writes on the more specifically moral problems. Since expressions of agreement are usually otiose, what follows may make the extent of my divergence from Professor Duncan-Jones seem greater than it is. He mentions, as one of Butler's reasons for his view that benevolence and self-love coincide, that public passions exist and are strong enough to give pleasure which self-love should not neglect. He forgets, however, to emphasise Butler's view that many passions (e.g. desire of esteem) whose objects (or objectives) are not the good of others nevertheless, thanks to a benevolent providence, prompt their possessors to perform actions which bring this about-a view which, through Adam Smith, became part of the foundation of nineteenth century laissez faire economics. Benevolence is not, according to Professor Duncan-Jones, a 'general ' passion for the good of others, but a ' continuant ' (not, surely, in W. E. Johnson's sense) passion, which may manifest itself in many different ways, e.g. in friendship, paternal or filial affection. Hence the existence of the latter does prove the existence in some degree of the former, whereas Professor Broad argues that it does not. He might have added that benevolence in the sense of a desire for the happiness of others without distinction of persons is, as Hume pointed out, too weak to provide much pleasure for self-love. Professor Duncan-Jones attributes to Butler an 'objectivist ' theory of conscience, according to which its main function is to discern duties which exist prior to all will-and presumably to all thought and feeling -whatever. There is no doubt that Butler generally speaks in this way, but his theory is less unequivocal than Professor Duncan-Jones indicates. Butler sometimes speaks as if conscience creates rather than discovers obligations; as if it is, rather than discerns, what is authoritative; as if the rule of right were within us, rather than the power of recognizing it; as if conscience promulgated, rather than 'intuited', the rules on</page><page sequence="18">NEW BOOKS 563 which we ought to act. If conscience recognizes independently existing obligations, little more can be made of Butler's view, that the virtuous action is proportionate to the most authoritative part of our nature, than Professor Broad's interpretation, that the right action is the action which the ideally good man (i.e. the man who always acts rightly) would do; personally, I think Butler was trying to say something more informative than this. Butler occasionally speaks as if God caused certain actions to be duties by directing our consciences to approve of them. On an 'objectivist' theory of conscience, this would imply that God either prevents our consciences from discerning obligations which we do have, or causes them to seem to discern obligations which we do not have. Professor Duncan-Jones argues, rightly, that Butler's view that con- science and self-love coincide does not mean that they are identical, and that conscience, not self-love, is supreme. However, on the one hand he only considers one of the passages where Butler seems to depart from that view, and, on the other, is unduly worried by the fact that Butler was prepared to maintain that, if an action is a duty, this is itself a conclusive reason for doing it, and at the same time to give, as a further reason, that it is also in our interest. That a conclusive reason has been given for an action does not logically prevent us from giving a further reason for it, nor make the previous reason any less conclusive, and, since human beings are in part irrational, reasons more than conclusive may be neces- sary to get them to perform an action they dislike. The question whether conscience or self-love should be followed if they conffict is not for Butler, as Professor Duncan-Jones suggests it is, an academic one; Butler recognizes that duty often conflicts with what men erroneously suppose to be their interest. A discussion (difficult for the layman to follow) of the freedom of the will seemed to me to be marred by the intrusion of 'free to do A' in the sense of 'not morally obliged not to do A', since philosophers who have discussed the subject have not held that the will either was or was not free in this sense. In a discussion of the view that our duties may be traced up to bene- volence or the want of it (here 'benevolence' does seem to mean a generalised desire for other people's happiness) Professor Duncan-Jones sometimes speaks as if utilitarianism (which both he and Butler errone- ously identify with that view) is more rational and economical than intuitionism. Intuitionism in the sense in which it is opposed to utili- tarianism, however, does not necessarily maintain that moral truths are known by intuition, and utilitarians may, and Sidgwick, for example, -did, hold that their principle is known by intuition. Utilitarianism is only necessarily more economical than intuitionism in that it admits fewer ultimate principles intuited, not in that it dispenses with intuition while 'intuitionism' does not. Professor Duncan-Jones, in an excellent chapter entitled 'God in Butler's Ethics', seems to me to be wrong in attributing to Butler the view that all our passions have good objects. Perhaps Butler holds that many passions are good, not in the sense that their objects are good, but only in the sense that, though their objects are morally indifferent, the effects of satisfying them are generally good. Professor Duncan-Jones's discussion of naturalism contains a frequently propounded definition of naturalism which would make non-naturalism a tautology from which nothing material about the nature of ethical judgments would follow. That obligation-bearing qualities are distinct</page><page sequence="19">564 NEW BOOKS from obligations is a truism which the naturalist need not deny; in calling a quality 'obligation-bearing' we already imply that it is not itself an obligation. Nor does the falsity of naturalism follow from the further tautologies that 'rightness and wrongness do not resolve them- selves into tests of rightness and wrongness', or, as some philosophers put it, that a moral conclusion does not follow from non-moral premises. Such ways of refuting naturalism could seem plausible only to a philo- sopher already convinced on other grounds that naturalism was false. This last chapter, 'Some Ultimate Problems of Ethics', seemed to me to presuppose too much previou's knowledge of moral philosophy. A book designed to be an introduction to this subject should contain some guide to further reading. Professor Duncan-Jones's book promises well for the Pelican Philosophy series, and it is to be hoped that it will be followed by more like it. J. HARRISON. The Works of Aristotle Translated into English. Under the editorship of SIR DAVID Ross. Volume XII: Select Fragments. Oxford, at the Clarendon Press, 1952. Pp. xii + 162. 15s. SIR DAVID Ross took leave of the Oxford Translation of Aristotle in 1931, with the completion of Volume III; and it then consisted of eleven volumes. What there is both of introduction and of conclusion to the series is still to be found in Volume III. But in 1952, twenty-one years later, he added the present Volume XII, consisting of Select Fragments. He does not explicitly say, either on the title-page or elsewhere, who selected these fragments or who translated them. His Preface fairly definitely implies that he himself selected them, but implies nothing about who translated them. It seems clear, however, that he is also the author of all the translations except probably the two translations from the Arabic mentioned below. After an introduction of six pages on the lost works of Aristotle, the translations begin with six pages of fragments about the general nature of Aristotle's dialogues. These passages make so clear what Aristotle meant by 'exoteric' that one wonders how it was ever misunderstood. Then follow about a hundred pages of translations of fragments of eighteen dialogues. Four of these dialogues are represented substantially enough to give some impression of their nature, namely Symposium, Eudemus or on Soul, Protrepticus, and On Philosophy. The texts here translated include nearly all those given by Rose for the dialogues in his editions of the fragments. In several cases, however, Sir David Ross -has made the fragment much larger than Rose made it, following the suggestions of subsequent scholars including Jaeger and Walzer. He has added two fragments from the Arabic recently brought to light by Walzer. He does not say who put these Arabic fragments into English. One of them is exactly Walzer's English translation as given in his original publication of the fragment, except that 'and what is generated from it ' has been omitted after ' the essence of love ', and that in the two strings of nouns Walzer's ' and 's have been changed into commas. The other I can only guess to be Sir David's translation of Walzer's Italian translation of the original (for in this case Walzer published his discovery in an Italian journal). Then follow twelve pages of translations of fragments from five 'logical works'. The most substantially represented is the On Contraries.</page><page sequence="20">NEW BOOKS 565 The last section of the text consists of thirty-six pages of translations of fragments of five 'philosophical works', of which three are substan- tially represented, namely On the Good, On fdeas, and On the Pythagoreans. Though the passages translated nearly all correspond to something in Rose, many of them are far longer in Ross than they were in Rose, in accordance with the views of Jaeger and Wilpert that Rose missed a great deal of the Aristotelian matter embedded in the books he excerpted for these works. No translation is given of any fragment assignable to Aristotle's works in rhetoric or poetics or physics or zoology or history, or to his speeches or letters or verse. Sir David seems to have intended to benefit only 'philosophers' in the contemporary narrow sense of the word. There are, however, persons who are eager to know about this or that 'non- philosophical' part of Aristotle's great work, and are unable to use the Greek text. I am sorry they are not catered for. I am especially sorry that the fragments of letters and verse were not translated. The translations are followed by a list of authors quoted, a table corre- lating Rose's numberings with the pages of the translation, a biblio- graphy of modern works on the fragments, and a short index giving eight modern names, about a hundred ancient names, and thirty-two topics. Certain improvements could easily be made in a reprinting. (1) It would be good to have a table of the twelve volumes of the Oxford Translation printed in the text, and not merely on the wrapper as here. (The misprint on the wrapper concerning Volume XI should be corrected.) (2) The names of ancient authors and works should be fully spelled out at least once in the book, preferably in the list of authors quoted. Even the classical scholar may have to think for a considerable while before realizing what the following means: 'AUG. C. Iul. Pel.' (p. 41). The nonclassicist will probably never get it at all, and yet he may well want to look up a translation of the whole work from which the fragment is taken. (P. 4 'DIOG. Oen.' is a misprint for 'DIOG. OEN.'.) (3) More details should be given about Rose's editions of the fragments. We learn from the Preface that Rose published a Teubner edition. We learn from page xii that he published a Berlin edition and a Leipzig edition. We learn from the bibliography, page 156, that he published editions in 1863, in 1870, and in 1886. But we must go to a library to discover how to correlate these pieces of information, for no places of publication are given in the bibliography. RICHARD ROBINSON. Roger Bacon and his search for a Universal Science. By STEWART C. EASTON. New York: Columbia University Press; Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1952. Pp. viii + 255. 25s. ONE of the most striking features of scientific writings in the whole period of 'the origins of modern science', from the twelfth to the seventeenth century, is the strong element of propaganda they nearly always contain for a new method. This is natural enough: new forms of inquiry brought genuinely new problems of method; these had to be justified and know- ledge of them spread. Most readers will be familiar with the flavour of Francis Bacon's and Descartes' propaganda, and here another character- istic ingredient should be noted: they give an interpretation of the history of science up to their time which carried with it a formula for future</page><page sequence="21">566 NEW BOOKS advance; their accounts of a desirable scientific method were largely an elaboration of this formula. Some four centuries earlier, Roger Bacon had made a somewhat similar use of history: " we of later ages should supply what the ancients lacked since we have entered into their labours . . . we should add to their works but bend their labours to our own ends ", as he put it in his Opus Maius, i; and all his most important writings were an elaboration of a methodological formula, addressed to the Pope, as the head of Christendom, " in the form of a plea for the study of science " (Opus Tertium, vi), for getting scientific knowledge that would be both enlightening and useful. c Roger Bacon's position in the history of historical opinion is complicated by the fact that he himself became a counter in the game of legend and propaganda. In the sixteenth century, the English mathematicians, Dr. John Dee and Leonard and Thomas Digges, collected manuscripts of his writings and regarded their own work of scientific reform as an attempt to raise the level of English science to something like that at which Bacon and the generation of two after him had left it. The dramatist Greene, perhaps guying Marlowe's Faustus, made Bacon an attractive and highly intelligent magician, an Oxford don bristling with amiable common sense. In the seventeenth century he got a kind couplet in Hudibras: Yet none a deeper knowledge boasted Since old Hodg Bacon and Bob Grosted. A century later, in Joseph Priestley's History and Present State of Dis- coveries relating to Vision, Light, and Colours (1772), he had become isolated from his age as a beacon of science in a fog of ignorant superstition. Emil Charles completed this piece of nonsense in 1861 by making Roger Bacon into a nineteenth-century positivist and a " martyr of science ", in a work that otherwise was the first serious study of Bacon's life. More recent studies of Bacon, principally by Little, Thorndike, Carton, Steele (who was responsible for the edition of his unpublished writings undertaken by the Oxford University Press), and Vanderwalle have placed him in truer perspective in the landscape of a vastly increased general knowledgfe of medieval thought, and in 1950 Fr. T. Crowley produced the first adequate biography in his Roger Bacon, The problem of the soul in his philosophical commentaries (Louvain and Dublin, 1950). Dr. Easton explains in his preface that Fr. Crowley's book appeared after his own had been completed; their agreement in most essentials is the more impressive. Dr. Easton's biography is both readable and learned. He makes com- petent use of the available evidence, including the probable chronology of Bacon's writings, to build up a picture of the main stages in his life and in the development of his intellectual interests. The edition of Bacon's Quaestiones on Aristotle's Physics, published by Steele and Delorme in 1935, enables him to show how the papal ban on Aristotle's natural philosophy and metaphysics in Paris allowed Oxford to gain the lead in these subjects while Bacon was taking his Arts course there. Dr. Easton argues that Bacon was invited to Paris to teach them shortly after 1240, when the ban ceased to be effective, and gives an interesting analysis of the lectures, including what looks like a piece of teasing of the serious young professor by hiis lively students. About 1247, Bacon's views underwent a radical change and about the same time he returned to England. Dr. Easton attributes this change to his reading of the Secretum Secretorum, an Arabic work believed in the thirteenth century to have been written by Aristotle for Alexander, telling him how universal knowledge had once been</page><page sequence="22">NEW BOOKS 567 revealed to the Sonis of Seth. The Secret of Secrets, of which a new trans- lation was completed in 1243, offered a vision of a'universal science that would place in the hands of Christian philosophers the key not only to all rational wisdom, but also the means of using scientific knowledge as an instrument of power: by means of a stone they could learn to cure diseases and prolong life; they would be able to construct giant burning mirrors and other machines to defeat the enemies of Christendom in the field. Dr. Easton sees the whole of the rest of Bacon's life-his work on languages, mathematics, optics, astronomy, the calendar, astrology, alchemy, medi- cine-as dedicated to the fulfilment of this vision of a universal science indispensable both in its own right and as a handmaid to theology. While agreeing in the main with Dr. Easton's characterisation of Bacon's view of the ultimate purpose of natural science, it seems to me that, by giving a unique role to the Secret of Secrets as Bacon's chief inspiration, he does less than justice to Bacon's view of the more immediate methods and purposes of mathematics and experiment, and underestimates a very different source of inspiration, Robert Grosseteste, to whose influence Bacon's change of view about 1247 can with much probability be attributed. I have dealt with these matters in detail elsewhere. Grosseteste spent most of his adult life in positions of responsibility, both as a teacher and an administrator, and he wrote with the moderation of one who can recog- nise the possible; Bacon never held any position of responsibility and his speculations on the ultimate uses to which science could be put were often wildly impractical. But of the methods of scientific inquiry, and especially of the use of experiment and mathematics, both had a similar, and an essentially practical appreciation. Bacon extended Grosseteste's work on a number of problems and his contributions were well-conceived, systematic and accurate. Especially noteworthy is his work on the calendar, the rainbow, and types of reflecting and refracting surfaces, some of the last of which he suggested could be used to correct defective vision. Dr. Easton has not in this book analysed Bacon's work as a scientist, which perhaps explains his preoccupation with him as a sort of superior magician who really wanted to be a theologian and his overlooking of Bacon as a man who made real contributions to the problems of science and of the logic of science and who was as such quite at home in his age. It is a pity also that Dr. Easton has chosen to write so much of the story in terms of a particuilar psychological interpretation of Bacon as a theologian manque. Nevertheless this is a book that will be read with profit and pleasure by everyone interested in Roger Bacon and in medieval thought. There are a few misprints: on p. 8 "Chapter X " should be " Chapter IX"; and on pp. 67, 86, 97 and 111 the numbering of sections has been bungled. A. C. CROMBIE. The Logic of Liberty. By M. POLYANI. Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1951. Pp. 200. 15s. IT seems as if the fashionable way of bringing old topics like " God ", " personality ' and " liberty " to the notice of the public is to insert the word " logic" somewhere in the title. Certainly there seems little other reason, except alliterative attractiveness, for the title of this miscellaneous collection of essays around the topic of liberty. Nevertheless this book, has some interesting and important things to say about two central</page><page sequence="23">568 NEW BOOKS topics-the presuppositions of scientific activity and the concept of organisation. Professor Polyani, in defending the traditional view of science as the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake against those who would plan it or make it subservient to utilitarian purposes, maintains that it has a " fiduciary" basis. The scientist is " committed " to his beliefs. By such beliefs he seems to mean not so much the norms implicit in scientific procedure (e.g. take careful account of contrary instances, consider the argument of a rival rather than his personal or social idiosyncracies, etc.) but particular assumptions put forward in scientific theories, which are shared by a scientific community. He quotes, apparentlywith approval, the restrictive attitude of scientists to hypnotism and extrasensory perception, and gives examples of actual experiments which, though seeming to be bona fide, have been ignored by scientists because they are so obviously contrary to existing assumptions. Scientists, he maintains, are com- mitted to their own orthodoxy. Professor Polyani is horrified at the case of Lysenko and the dictation of scientific beliefs by state officials; but he seems to think that the only effective safeguard against state dictation lies in the constricting orthodoxy of the scientific elite. But this, surely, is a confusion which is the result of his failure to distinguish the different senses in which science can have a " fiduciary " basis. The Lysenko case was a departure from the scientific tradition not because it involved the scientifically heterodox hypothesis of environmentalism but because it involved a radical departure from the procedures by means of which assumptions, however orthodox or heterodox, are dealt with. The intrusion of the state into the discussion was a breach of procedure-a large-scale intrusion of extra-scientific interests into deciding between two hypotheses. The author's confusion of orthodoxy in respect of assumptions with orthodoxy in respect of procedures is dangerous as well as misleading; for it encourages the tyranny of fashions which many would regard as one of the less desirable aspects of the scientific com- munity. He does, however, seem to suggest that it is the normative beliefs implicit in the procedures of science which must not be given up when he maintains that we must defend our orthodoxies not simply because they are orthodoxies but because they are also true. He wants to show that " freedom of thought is rendered pointless and must disappear, where reason and morality are deprived of their status as a force in their own right " (p. 107). He therefore attacks the rationalist tradition which culminated in the positivists, who preached scientism but systematically undermined the moral values which science presupposes and without which it cannot stand up to the state. John Locke appears as one of the main villains in this alleged erosion of reason and morality and is criticized for his advocacy of toleration on the grounds that religious beliefs are indemonstrable and therefore not suitable criteria for persecution. Apply the criterion of demonstrability to moral beliefs also, says Professor Polyani, and the logical outcome is ethical nihilism. But he overlooks Locke's laboured and insistent distinctions between inward faith and outward action and between speculative and practical opinions; he woefully mispresents Locke's account of morality and neglects his dis- tinction between morality and legality on which the Second Treatise turns. He even " forgets " to mention that Locke thought that Catholics and Mohammedans, as well as atheists, should not be tolerated because of their social unreliability ! These points of details, like the dismissal of</page><page sequence="24">NEW BOOKS 569 Kant's views in one sentence, may seem to be rather trivial; but they are characteristic of the author's sorties into history and philosophical exegesis. Positivism needs to be attacked and exposed; the moral assumptions implicit in scientific method need to be stressed. But it is a pity that this could not have been done without recourse to so many dubious interpretations. The other thesis of the book is an attack on the suggestion, once current even in this country, that science should be planned. Professor Polyani tries to show the inefficiency, indeed the impossibility, of such an attempt by distinguishing two types of order-" corporate order " which is centrally imposed by a planner who supervises and directs operations of people right down to the bottom of a hierarchical structure, and " spon- taneous order " which comes about by the mutual adjustment of parts within some kind of a system without central direction. Suppose that a weight was attached to a system of flexible and interconnected struts and the task was to calculate what would happen to them all individually. The problem might be tackled by simultaneous equations provided that there were not too many variables. This would be the centralist's procedure. It would, however, have to be succeeded by the method of successive approximation if the variables increased. The displacement at the centre next to the weight would have to be calculated; then the dis- placement at the next centre due to the displacement at the first centre. And so on. With a very large number of centres the only feasible method would be to place a calculator at each centre and calculate the displace- ment at each centre on the basis of reports from calculators at other centres. By this method the total distortion could be calculated without anyone at the centre having this explicit task. This model is then trans- ferred to the social field to show how certain social tasks can only be carried out by adopting a polycentric procedure. Just as our muscles undergo countless co-ordinated adjustments in order that the equilibrium of the sitting posture can be preserved, so a body of scientists can main- tain a kind of order by adjusting themselves to each other's discoveries while pursuing their own interests. This sort of order, he maintains, can never be imposed from the centre. Only routine tasks and technological projects are susceptible to central direction, not " polycentric " activities like those of science, the common law, and economic activity. By means of these " ideal types " of spontaneous and corporate order Professor Polyani is able to comfort scientists, judges and business men by showing the impossibility as well as the undesirability of planning their activities. But the reader is rather sceptical when he learns that economic planners in the main chant incantations over the impossible. Are not these " ideal types " presented in too stark a contrast ? Are there not homeostatic systems with a hierarchical structure and systems with central direction without the man at the centre planning and super- vising all the activities of those below him in the hierarchy ? Do not those who have contact with concrete pieces of planning say that in fact most problems are concerned with lines of responsibility and delegation of decision making ? How many people who advocate " planning " really envisage a " corporate order " as depicted by Professor Polyani ? Should not he take samples of other associations like schools, churches, clubs, families, and so on, which are social groups with social tasks in a sense in which science, economic activity, and the common law are not, and see how his analysis fits a wider range of social tasks ? For the reader cannot help reflecting that Professor Polyani has used his physical</page><page sequence="25">570 NEW BOOKS -models to give a persuasive definition of " planning " and has selected those social tasks which obviously cannot be " planned " in the sense ,defined. " The Logic of Liberty " contains many other stimulating discussions -on such topics as professionalism and acquisitiveness, profits and poly- centricity, the positivist theory of society, Marxism, Soviet Economic planning, social determinism, and the Lysenko case. These discussions ,are worked loosely into the general themes of the commitment of the .scientist and the virtues of polycentricity. Indeed the book itself, being mainly a series of ad hoc articles occasioned by what other scientists have done and said, seems to exemplify in itself some kind of spontaneous ,order rather than a coherent structure imposed on material. R. PETERS. The Place of Hooker in the History of Thought. By PETER MUNZ. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd., 1952. Pp. x + 217. 18s. THE Reformation in England had settled little by the rejection of the authority of the Pope. Two great problems remained unsolved. The first was the nature of the Church: was it still the old Church funda- mentally unchanged, or was it a new Church requiring a new structure ? The second was the relation of Church and State: were they one, or were they separate and autonomous ? These were the problems faced by Richard Hooker at the close of the sixteenth century and which he attempted to solve in the Laws of Ecclesitastical Polity. Hooker was a conservative by nature, looking to the past in his attempt to save the Church and the Tudor State from the innovations demanded by the Puritans. Philosophically Hooker was a rationalist in the Thomistic-Aristotelian tradition, and the case that he made against the Puritans' replacement of reason with bibliolatry was powerful philo- sophically. Those very Puritans, however, found it completely irrelevant, and Hooker was unsuccessful in stemming the tide of Puritanism. As an apologist for the Tudor State he was also unsuccessful because of the compromises into which he was forced in striving to reconcile his dominant Thomism with the naturalistic trends of the political thinking of Marsilius of Padua. Yet if the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity was a failure in the realm of controversy, it was a glorious failure and a landmark in intel- lectual history. Mr. Munz's study of Hooker is highly instructive and suggestive. He has convincingly shown how Hooker turned to the right men for the right reasons; he has also shown that these very tools adopted by Hooker made a consistent solution impossible. This is the paradox of Hooker: that he re-lived in his own thinking several irreconcilable medieval phitosophies. Whether Hooker, however, was fully aware of the basic inconsistencies in his thought and whether because of this realization he failed to publish all eight books of his great work are questions that remain unresolved. In a short study ranging back and forth through the centuries, the historian is frequently driven to simplification and sometimes to over- simplification. Thus Mr. Munz generalizes overmuch concerning the consistency of schools of, thought-Aristotelianism, Augustinianism, Averroism, Thomism-rather than dealing with not so consistent indivi- dual thinkers. Likewise he tends to oversimplify Puritanism, treating it</page><page sequence="26">NEW BOOKS 571 for what it surely was not, a single and complete set of religious beliefs. Mr. Munz is perhaps least convincing when he argues that Hooker had a historical sense, that " on the grounds of medieval rationalism one could arrive at a historical sense ". One is perplexed, for example, to find Hooker's appeal to the " sana mens " of all men treated as induction. If this thesis is to receive serious consideration, it will need to be expanded into something more than a brief three-page appendix. Mr. Munz is to be congratulated upon his notable success in breaking down the barriers so frequently to be found between philosophy and history. Studies of this nature are useful to both philosopher and historian; they are coming to hold an increasingly important place in the learned world. E. C. MOSSNER. English Law and the Moral Law. By A. L. GOODHART, K.B.E., Q.C. London: Stevens &amp; Sons, 1953. Pp. x + 151. 12s. 6d. IN his Hamlyn lectures Dr. Goodhart reconsiders the relation between " law in general ", " State law " and " moral law ". Law in general, he argues, consists of rules of conduct recognised as obligatory. State, international, moral and religious law are subdivisions of law in general. Coercion is neither the mark of law in general nor of State law; otherwise we could not distinguish law from banditry, or democracy from despotism. State law differs from moral law in that it binds members of a given society rather than men in general. The rules of State law are those recognised by judges. Recognition depends on a sense of moral obligation, and if that is lacking, the rules cease to bind; hence " disbelief in the existence of international law may destroy its very existence ". The differences between what are ordinarily and henceforth called law and morals are therefore narrower that is usually supposed. In considering Goodhart's argument a number of questions must be distinguished. From what motives do people obey the law ? Is there a moral duty, in general, to obey and law and if so, why ? What are the necessary conditions for a legal system to exist ? For a rule of a given system to be valid ? Do the necessary conditions for a valid rule of English law include a moral requirement ? How do morals influence the making and interpretation of law ? As Goodhart says, fear of coercion is only one of several possible motives for obeying the law. Again, the duty to obey depends on the moral notion of reciprocity and is based on " reason ", not coercion. Goodhart also denies that sanction or coercion is part of the definition of law. Would it be acceptable to say that one of the necessary conditions for the existence of a legal system is regulated coercion, while another is that judges recognise one or more ultimate rules from which all others derive their validity ? Again, rules of constitutional, international or indeed domestic law may be incorporated in a system such as English law without a sanction being provided for the breach of each rule; to this extent, Goodhart's criticism of Kelsen's view that each rule of a system requires a sanction, is justified. But is the system as a whole law unless backed by coercion ? For State law, at least, Goodhart half admits that it is not, when he describes a State as a society organised for the primary purpose of keeping physical order. Goodhart further argues that in English law there are limitations on the legislative power of Parliament which are " part of the British</page><page sequence="27">572 NEW BOOKS constitutional law ". But " the courts cannot enforce these principles as they can . . . in the United States ". So the limitations, not being recognised by English judges, are presumably binding not as law in the ordinary sense but as conventions or moral rules, and in " British consti- tutional law " " law " must mean Goodhart's " law in general ". The moral may be that the difference between democracy and despotism is not a legal question. Interesting instances are cited of the influence of moral ideas on various branches of English law. It is refreshing to find moral liability distiriguished from fault. I am morally bound to compensate you if my children demolish your hothouse, however little I may be at fault. Whether law should follow morals so far is, no doubt, debatable. A. M. HoNORE. Two Commandments. Bv CARL JORGENSEN, translated by PETER HARDT. Copenhagen: Ejnar Munksgaard, 1950. Pp. 254. Dan. Cr. 14.50. THIS is the work of a Danish amateur philosopher, not to be confused with the Danish philosopher, J. J(Irgensen, whose name will be familiar to readers of MIND. Carl J/)rgensen's aim in this book is to establish a practical science of ethics. He thinks this can ke done, consistently with allowing full freedom of choice on matters of fundamental moral value, provided two principles are accepted. These are: that one should promote what one holds to be good, and counter what one holds to be evil. Ethics then becomes the study of the means whereby one may best encompass these two ends. But the difficulty throughout is clear. While the content provided for this science consists of genuine knowledge, it is always knowledge provided by some other practical science, such as medicine, economics, dietetics, etc. This is unavoidable. Ethics, on this view, would at best be a digest of all the practical sciences, all unified under a misleading name. Nevertheless, the work has philosophical interest if it is regarded, not as an attempt to establish a science of ethics, but as an unwittingf analysis of the ethical presuprositions underlying the development of the existing practical sciences. So regarded, it has some novel and useful things to say, and one cannot but regret that the author himself did not wittingly formulate his task in this way. W. J. REES.
