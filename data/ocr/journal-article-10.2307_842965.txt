Introduction This is, primarily, a study of certain forms of diminution as found in the system of functional tonality. Its sources of in- spiration are the above quotations and Mozart's piano sonatas. *3 The specific concern here is with the pursuit and possible elucidation of two related problems: (1) the critical problems of relating Mozart's compositional procedures to certain eight- eenth- century notions of organic form, particularly as revealed in Goethe's concept of Steigerung, and (2) the technical problem of demonstrating that the capacity of a few simple and typical</page><page sequence="3">167 musical shapes to contribute to the control of varying time- spans of a composition is a significant, though of course not unique, feature in the creation of organic form, as that term is construed by musicians. A word of caution here: The word "shape" is used in its literal sense, as the suggestion of a form created by the actual or implied directions of certain tones. Since I consider shape to be intuitively anterior to function, I will accordingly be talking about shape as such, and not about the function of shape. If this point of view is not held in mind, one could easily misinterpret the intention of the analysis. In order to make the range of application of Steigerung as broad as possible, reference is made to types of shapes that look in- nocuous in their simplicity, but, precisely because of this, turn out to be effective inhibiting agents with regard to diminu- tional options. It can be hoped that lengthy argument about the compatibility of Mozart and Goethe would be unnecessary here; nevertheless, a brief explanation of the choice of this pairing (rather than, for example, a Beethoven - Goethe pairing), and of the choice of the piano sonatas, will provide some introductory remarks. We sometimes have to be reminded that Goethe was only seven years older than Mozart; more commonly known is Goethe's appreciation of Mozart's music, as is evidenced, for example, in this conversation with Eckermann, dated March 11, 1832: . . . Let any man just try. . .to create one work worthy to be set beside those. .. of Mozart or Raphael or Shakespeare ! I well know that these three noble figures by no means stand alone, and that in every branch of art there are numberless outstanding minds whose work has reached no lesser heights thantheirs. But insofar as they equalled them ingreatness, then they excelled common human nature in equal measure and were as divinely gifted as those three. *4 In a letter to Schiller, Goethe wrote, "Your hopes for opera are richly fulfilled in Don Giovanni"; Goethe, in addition, would have selected Mozart, had he lived longer, as the only com- poser able to successfully transform Faust into an opera. *5 Don Giovanni is again mentioned by Goethe in an interesting remark about the nature of composition: [Composition] is a very subversive word, for which we have the French to thank, but from which we should endeavor to free ourselves as quickly as possible. How can one say that Mozart composed Don Giovanni! 'Composition' - as if</page><page sequence="4">168 it were a piece of pastry, a mixture of eggs, flour, and sugar! It is, [rather], a mental creation, a single [effusion] penetrating the individual component as well as the whole, whereby the creator in no way proceeds by arbitrary ex- peritmentation and patching together, but is enjoined by the demonic spirit of his genius, which holds him in its power, to do what must necessarily be done. *6 But both men's preoccupation with morphology and morphologi- cal processes, at a time when problems of form were at least as important to their culture as they are to contemporary art- ists and scientists, is, of course, their most obvious and sig- nificant common element. The choice of the piano sonatas was made for at least two rea- sons: (1) they represent a challenge to any analyst, when he might more easily use Mozart's six "Haydn" quartets as models for the particular ideas to be pursued here; (2) and they rep- resent, to the analyst as well as to the reader, a unified genre as well as a convenient source of reference. Space does not permit, nor does the argument call for, intensive inquiry into all the sonatas. I will first present a few brief examples from various sonata movements before going into some detail, using larger excerpts. II. The Concept of Steigerung A rather thorough treatment of Goethe's concept of Steigerung is to be found in Elizabeth Wilkinson's article, "Tasso - ein Gesteigerter Werther' in the Light of Goethe's Principle of 'Steigerung'". *7 Her collocation of the many ways in which Goethe has used this word will prove quite useful here. In general, the word Steigerung signifies an intensification of those internal features of an organism which tend to give it its individuality. However anthropomorphic this may sound, it involves a recognition on the part of the organism of its own internal norms, and an endeavor to allow these norms to per- meate and to enhance its every aspect. Wilkinson writes that "it is a question of avoiding arbitrary combinations, of knowing the difference between seeing order and imposing order". *8 For our purposes, this means that a "gesteigerte" composition will reveal orderings and relations of an internal sort, as op- posed to orderings sometimes projected into a composition by the analyst. We are not saying that the latter sort of orderings are not useful, but only that such projections seem to belong</page><page sequence="5">169 to a different aesthetic concept. The facet of "internalness", as it related to Steigerung, was applied by Goethe to his own behavior and to human behavior in general: The earlier a man realized that there is a craft or an art that can help him systematically to enhance his natural dis- positions, the happier he is; whatever he receives from outside, does no harm to his innate individuality. . . . I have nothing more pressing to do than to enhance as much as possible that which is and remains in me, and to distil my peculiarities. *9 (Norbert Guterman) And in a similar vein: But now yet another [Goethe] is here, who always asks, what will be thought of what he has created ? Because his efforts always ascend a step higher, because he seeks no Ideal, but rather, by struggle and by sport, will allow his feelings to develop to [their utmost] capacity. *10 Steigerung is, therefore, involved with questions of how one may realize inborn potentialities and develop characteristics that are increasingly differentiated. For Goethe, this involves an oupward progression manifesting itself in a polarity of op- posing forces.*1 1 In this respect, his use of the word kohobieren (see footnote 9) is quite interesting. It is a word of Arabic origin, apparently used in alchemy in connectionwith processes of distillation, or refining essences: It will be recalled that Goethe formulated a theory to explain why a plant produced leaves that steadily progressed from simple to more complex forms and why the more delicate sepals and petals were formed only subsequently. He postu- lated that in the process of growth the juices in the plant vessels grew more and more refined, and that these more highly specialized saps were the cause for the formation of the more complex appendages, such as flower and fruit. This hypothesis is of revolutionary importance, for it em- bodies the concept that plant metabolism gives rise to chem- ical substances that reach the places where the appendages are to be formed, and there decisively influence organic structure. . . . In the formulation of such views on the physiology of plant growth, Goethe anticipated problems that were to engage attention only about a hundred years later. *12 Indeed, it appears only too easy to bring Goethe up to date by</page><page sequence="6">170 comparing his writings with those of twentieth-century (if not contemporary) writings in biology. We choose Leo Leob's The Biological Basis of Individuality (1945) as a representative sample of the latter. In distinguishing two types of individual- ity, Loeb writes: The first is the mosaic type which represents the sum of the particular organ and tissue characteristics (organ and tissue differentials) which determine structure, metabolism, motor and psychical activities and the component parts of which differ in different individuals. These multiple char- acteristics are combined into a composite or mosaic which is peculiar to each individual. The second type of individuality which may be designated as the essential individuality is characterized by the presence of a chemical factor - the individuality differential - which is common to the different organs and tissues of each indi- vidual and which differs from the corresponding chemical characteristics of the organs and tissues of every other in- dividual. This concept emphasizes the oneness of the indi- vidual which depends upon the presence of a common and unique factor in all of his essential parts. *13 The term kohobieren, as part of the concept of Steigerung, is used by Goethe to describe, by analogy to bio-chemical pro- cesses, the refinement of one's individuality, the process of concentrating the very elements which comprise one's own uniqueness. Indeed, the activity of analogical thinking is a fundamental feature of Goethe's mental processes. During the years when Goethe was writing his novel, Elective Affinities, he was at the same time in full pursuit of his scientific studies. The title of the novel is in fact a reflection of these studies, and is borrowed from the well-known chemical affinity of sul- furic acid for lime. Goethe uses analogy quite self-consciously: Analogical thinking need not be criticized; analogy has this advantage, that it does not delimit or in any sense [repre- sent] finality; against this, induction is pernicious. . . .*14 By now it should be clear that this paper, likewise, is pro- ceeding analogically, as indeed it must, if the concept of Steigerung is to be fully apprehended and significantly applied. But, it might well be asked, what has all this to do with music ? Apparently, Patricia Carpenter thinks that biological processes have a lot to do with music; in her article on "The Musical Ob- ject", she writes that</page><page sequence="7">171 It is fruitful to look at the emergence of the musical object by analogy to genetic development - i. e., as an increasing differentiation of parts of the organism, on the one hand, and as an increasing hierarchization and subordination of the parts to the whole, on the other - because the analogy illuminates in a broad way perceptual problems that this particular kind of form presents in music. *15 More specifically, the operations of Steigerung will be seen to provide the focus, the raison d'etre, for the analyses. The latter will be involved with demonstrating three things: (1) that the diminution can be charged with significance in proportion to the kind and number of relationships it forms with events on larger time-spans; (2) that the diminution can, accordingly, participate in the sometimes unique and unexpected behavior of larger events, and (3) that the diminution is an integral part of the compositional strategy of controlled variation. Under- lying this demonstration are the following assumptions: (1) that significant elements common to both small and large designs can indeed be found; (2) that the process of controlled variation may take place on only one level, or on fewer than all levels; (3) that this process carries within itself a tendency to persist in a finite number of forms - for present purposes, quite a small number; (4) that the larger the time-span of a shape, the more eidetic the shape becomes; and (5) that however many varying time-spans are involved, they are not to be understood as derived from each other according to some externally im- posed norm, but rather as derived from the eidetic norm itself. Some discussion of these assumptions seems necessary for a further elucidation of Steigerung. The first assumption has to do with the possibility of forming relationships either with different time-spans but on the same structural level, or with the elements located on various struc- tural levels. The notion of figure and background naturally comes to mind, on which subject the philosopher Alphonso Lingis writes: We thus come to understand that the high-noon visibility of evidence is not possible without the latency of the background. This is not simply the negative and privative contingency that but one object at a time would fill with plenary presence the limited diaphragm of a consciousness factically finite. It is that the figure owes not only its relief but its very iden- tity to the occulation of the background. . . . The particu- lar is from the first open to the system, open upon system; involvement is its constitutive characteristic. Heidegger</page><page sequence="8">172 thus discovers a sort of radiation of things, which are there only by referring beyond themselves. The background is the very spread of their dimensionality, their involvement, their signifyingness. *16 The second and third assumptions relate to Steigerung via its complement, described by Goethe as Polarit'it. Steigerung and Polarit'it became, for Goethe, the "two great driving wheels of all nature". *17 The polarity principle, among other things, imposes certain stringencies on Steigerung. If left to itself, the latter would produce unceasing change and variety. What is therefore needed is the interaction of Steigerung with the Spezificationstrieb (tendency toward specificity). This activity is to be understood as the complement of Steigerung; together, they bring about stable and memorable forms, rather than a chaos of arbitrarily and infinitely shaped matter. For Goethe, change is meaningless without the contrary tendency of per- sistence in specific forms; this is brought out in his "Problem und Erwiderung" (1823): The idea of metamorphosis is one of the most venerable, but at the same time one of the most dangerous, gifts from above. It leads into formlessness, disorganizing and de- stroying consciousness. It is like a centrifugal force and would lose itself in infinity were it not for a counter-force: I mean the tendency toward specificity, the tenacious, con- stancy-seeking faculty, [contained] in everything that has ever come into being. This is a centripetal force, against the deepest foundations of which no externality can prevail. *18 Elsewhere in his Morphologie, Goethe writes that the organi- zation of the more advanced plants is "not a continuous, in- finite repetition of unchanged sameness"; that, in contradis- tinction to such open-ended repetition, there is suggested "the possibility of a closed form* by means of "refined organiza- tion, successively organized refinement". *19 Indeed, the more incomplete the creation, the more are its parts equivalent or similar to one another, and the more they are similar to the whole. But in the more complete work, the parts will be dissimilar. In the former case, the parts more or less resemble the whole, while in the latter, the parts do not. The more similar the parts are to one another, the less they can be subordinated. Subordination of parts signifies a complete creation. *20 Here, Goethe is apparently attempting to form a criterion of</page><page sequence="9">173 varying organizational levels, a hierarchy in which advanced forms of organic life are composed of individual parts which have specific duties, which are irreplaceable, and which are non- transplantable. Such is the result of the "tendency toward specificity", a concept which, like Goethe's extension of the word kohobieren, has not become obsolete. Referring again to the Biological Basis of Individuality, Loeb writes: Parallel to the increase in the extent of organ and tissue differentiation, with advancing regeneration there is a de- crease in transplantability. The earlier, less differentiated embryonal and regenerating tissues are still more plastic and adaptible to environmental factors than the farther ad- vanced stages, in which the organ and tissue differentials are more fixed and in which there is a greater tendency on the part of organs and tissues to develop by means of self- differentiation. In higher organisms the ability to produce new organs during regeneration is lost. There is again, therefore, noticeable here a relation between the differen- tiation and fixity of organs and tissue differentials and the increasing refinement of organismal differentials, both of these processes leading to a greater immutability and fixity of the organism as a whole. *21 Finally, the fourth and fifth assumptions recall Goethe's pre- occupation with archetypes (in reference to the organic world) and with the Urphlinamenon (as applied to the inorganic world). One of his most famous aphorisms states that "the highest thing would be to realize that everything factual is already the- ory. *22 In his Problem of Knowledge, Cassirer writes that there prevails in [Goethe's] writings a relationship of the "particular" to the "universal" such as can hardly be found elsewhere in the history of philosophy or of natural science . . . . The particular and the universal are not only in- timately connected but. . . they interpenetrate one another. The "factual" and the "theoretical" were not opposite poles to him. *23 When I say that the larger the time-span of a shape becomes, the more the shape becomes eidetic, I mean that the shape is transformed from an object of sense to an object of imagina- tion. Both kinds of objects exist, both can be experienced, but each has its own mode of existence, and its own link-up with experience. This seems to be one of the stumbling blocks of much of the criticism directed against Schenker's Ursatz. Even if the Ursatz were to be audible - and I am not saying that it</page><page sequence="10">174 can never be - I am not sure that it was meant to be audible. If it is meant as anything, it is as an eidetic structure, whose function, as with Goethe's Urphtnomenon, is to "illuminate more plainly everything individual in the phenomenon, and make it more understandable". *24 With the archetypes and the Ur- phanomenon, Goethe sought the thread "along which we grope our way through the labyrinth of living shapes". *25 III. Steigerung as Individuation Perhaps the most striking contemporary analogy to Steigerung and the Spezificationstrieb can be found in Langer's concepts of individuation and involvement. As associated with Steigerung, individuation emphasizes its functional rather than substantive category; that is, individuation, like Steigerung, is a process that has both direction and intensity. *26 Wilkinson implies basically the same thing: The emphasis of the individuation process. . . is on the re- lation between nature and nurture, between the unconscious activity of an organism containing the law of its development within itself and the conscious fostering of this development in accordance with that law. *27 Recalling Loeb's "individual differential", it appears that Steigerung and individuation are interchangeable terms em- bracing both the activity and the result of differentiation, re- finement, enhancement, intensification, and specialization. Steigerung, thus defined as individuation, consists in the "in- creasing subordination of all the parts of a work to its dominant intention" *28; it seems to describe the process of elaboration and refinement of the smallest detail, "so that the finest nuance has its specialized and unalterable function in the organization of the whole". *29 Individuation, as a primarily biological con- cept, can be analogically extended to the products of human creativity and can thereby throw light on the organization of their internal relations. It need only be added here that, while Steigerung canplay a significant role in the creation of organic form, it certainly is not the only standard of judgment we have available to us. The presence or absence of Steigerung dem- onstrates nothing about a composition's "value". Applied too self-consciously, the principle can even result in a mechanical and boring product. In other words, the work still must be interpreted by methods appropriate to musical analysis and criticism. IfSteigerung, in itself, cannot compel admiration, neither should it seek to impose itself as a criterion of value,</page><page sequence="11">175 or to violate the responses which, in any case, are already there. Inother words, Steigerung cannot create the experience, but it can help to order it and to communicate it. In such a role, it can lead to understanding, both of the composition and of oneself, but it need not, and should not, lead to proof. The composition is its own proof, and its own justification. IV. The Application of Steigerung By way of opening this analytical section, acknowledgement should be made of previous studies which were considered rel- evant here. Although these studies do not mention Steigerung, they share, hopefully, a common motivation withthis discourse. First mention should be given to Schenker's Der freie Satz and Das Meisterwerk in der Musik. In Das Wesen des musik- alischen Kunstwerks, Oswald Jonas points out several instances of "individuated" figures and diminutions by Mozart. Allen Forte's The Compositional Matrix has proven useful here as well as on other occasions. An interesting but sometimes problematic essay, "Harmonisch - melodische Modelle bei Mozart", by Hermann Beck, can be found in the Mozart Jahr- buch, 1967. Finally, in the interests of promoting a reasonable amount of uniformity, the analytical symbols used here have basically the same meaning as those found in the appendix to Salzer and Mitchell's The Music Forum, Volume 1 (1967). The procedure for the following pages will be as follows: shorter examples will be presented first, while the last part of the analyses focuses in more detail on larger time-spans. Thus I will not be considering the sonatas in the order in which they may have been composed. Excerpts from the following sonatas will be examined, in this order: K. 284, K. 545, K. 279, K. 283, K. 533, and K. 570. A. Sonata in D, K. 284, First Movement In Example 1, the diminution which I consider to be part of a "gesteigerte" process is presented under a bracket. The de- scending, stepwise shape is a condensation of the larger shape spanning measures 22 to 25 (Example 2). This span seems to stand out from the context - to be individuated - by its accom- panying line of linear sixths. What we see here are not chords which have a harmonic function, but rather, the whole texture has a morphological function: to descend. And the diminution of Example 1 certainly has a share in this function. The feel- ing of descent in all voice parts and on at least two levels is</page><page sequence="12">176 EXAMPLE 1 m 25 2</page><page sequence="13">177 enhanced by the fact that this phrase (and its repetition) are set off from preceding and succeeding events by a dynamic change (piano), and by the other fact that up until measure 22, functional harmony makes a strong contribution to the some- what operatic style of the opening measures. This style is picked up again after the linear sixths make their exit in meas- ure 29. Paradoxically, it may often be the case that the unique- ness of just such phrases as the two in measures 22 and 29 will provide some perceptual clues to the more normative Ur- linie, which, in this case, also happens to be a descending fifth. This opening example, then, typifies a situation whereby a dialectic of norm versus individual is established. In this case, a quite normative diminution shares in the uniqueness of a certain phrase by virtue of an identity of shape; the uniqueness of the phrase is then understood in the context of the normative background. In short, one perceives the interplay of Steigerung and Polaritft. B. Sonata in C, K. 545, Second Movement The passages selected here are notable for the sixth-spans occurring at different levels and in different voice parts. With- in the context of the movement, the sixth-spans are unique in- asmuch as they are to be found only in the bass in measures 41 to 42, and in the upper voice of measures 45 to 48. If one con- siders the essence of the sixth-span to be that of "sixthness", it can be seen that the shape of the diminutions frequentlypar- takes of this essence (Example 3). C. Sonata in C, K. 279, Third Movement The eighth-notes in the first measure of this movement are, in themselves, innocuous enough. One must turn to the events beginning in measure 77 to understahd how the diminution be- comes individuated, and how its relation to the motive is en- hanced (Examples 4 and 5). Each of the original eighth-notes in the bass of measure 1 is now expanded in time; and they participate in an approach to the recapitulation in a quite orig- inal manner. The traditional emphasis on the dominant is lack- ing; Mozart chooses instead to use register placement as a means of associating the longer span with the diminution of measure 1, as well as of creating a false recapitulation in measures 85 and 86. D. Sonata in G, K. 283, First Movement Space permits discussion of only one of the many interesting</page><page sequence="14">178 EXAMPLE 3 F i m. 4 -A I p L-. 6m A Ilc,-o :a- . ? ' ' , "'rFM Rol-', ; r Pir</page><page sequence="15">179 morphological structures to be encountered in this movement: that of the fourth-span. It makes its initial appearance in measure 16, participating in a rhythmic-melodic drive to re- gain d2 in measure 22 (Example 6). This appearance of the fourth-span is particularly obtrusive here; it has a rougher quality, perhaps due to the octave doublings, and the contrast between sound and silence seems more pronounced than in the opening motive (Example 7). This is no doubt because the eighth-note rests cut into the upward thrust of the diminution itself. I feel that this brief description of musical "facts" is necessary in order to point up the relation between the diminu- tion under discussion and the process of Steigerung. The re- lation of the diminution of the fourth-span to a larger line in this sonata is different from the relations considered in the three preceding sonatas. Here, it is the diminution itself which seems to be subject to the influence of Steigerung. In view of the above description of the diminution, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that it contributes to a textural and rhythmical event of an individuated kind. It finds its more stable form, however, in the fourth-span traversing measures 62 to 68 (Ex- ample 8). In contrast to the diminution, this line does not pro- ject itself from its context; it rides comfortably on a dominant prolongation and prepares smoothly for the recapitulation. E. Sonata in F, K. 533, Second Movement In this movement, attention will be focused primarily on the relationship between large time-spans in the development and diminutional figures in the exposition. Two such figures will be considered: they appear as Examples 9a and 9b. In order to follow the normal sequence of events in the development, however, I will discuss Example 9b first. Its form is, quite simply, that of an ascending minor 2nd followed, usually, by a descending 4th. Its augmentation in time is shared by both lower and upper voices over measures 47 to 55 of the develop- ment (Example 10). Once again, it is the large time-span, rather than the diminution, which seems to be individuated: in order to perceive the degree of individuation, one must con- sider the transparency of the texture of these measures, the frequently wide separation of the outer voices, and the rhyth- mically halting effect produced by alternation of diminutions and quarter-notes. The shape in Example 9a, although also presented as a de- scending figure, is subsequently related to a larger, ascending line in the development (Example 11). It is not altogether be- side the point to mention that the development, 26 measures</page><page sequence="16">180 EXAMPLE 6 nJ * 7 1 . " 8 9I- p ' f F.. - ' " O b. ,0</page><page sequence="17">131 long, is symmetrically divided by the change of direction in- itiated in measure 60. It is of further interest to hypothesize that this large descending-ascending shape spanning the whole development is an extension in musical space and time of the first three tones of the opening motive: B6-A-Bb. But what is indubitable is the flavor of individuality in these measures. The whole development exemplifies a type of unity which Goethe describes as not merely the re-union of disparate and polar elements, but one in which "the disparate parts intensify, and through the relationships of the intensified parts, can generate something different, unexpected, and more significant". *30 Recall, too, Loeb's description of the "individuality differen- tial", a concept emphasizing "the oneness of the individual which depends upon the presence of a common and unique fac- tor in all of its essential parts". (see Reference 13). F. Sonata in F, K. 570, First Movement As a final example of the process of Steigerung, the first move- ment of this sonata suggests interesting relationships not only among various time-spans, but also between the concepts of ordinality and cardinality. Fortunately, these relationships can be described concurrently. In this movement, Mozart seems to be matching the cardinal expression "6", as it is as- signed to both a specific diminution and a specific key area, to the ordinal expression `6th", which refers to a particular intervallic span. Example 12 cites three representative diminutions (from mea- sures 35, 44, and 77 of the exposition) which use scale degree 6 (of F) as an upper auxiliary. The use of the upper auxiliary on the level of the diminution is continued in the development, where, in addition, the cardinal 6 is transformed into an auxil- iary chord in measure 124 (Example 13) and into important key areas (D6 major and G minor), which stand symmetrically re- lated to B6 via a 6-relation: D6 B6 G 6 6 (This is all made quite audible by the use of B6 as an upper auxiliary within the key area of Db, and by the use of G as an upper auxiliary within the tonality of Bb.) This interpretation seems to be called for by the "gesteigerte" quality of the de- velopment, which resists meaningful harmonic analysis by means of a more conventional branching and nesting scheme.</page><page sequence="18">;II ra _J n (.

(dfi LL c c, (d~</page><page sequence="19">183 EXAMPLE 12 b. . . 13 ?EI -.M filoa~m Gy w F F -</page><page sequence="20">184 Finally, the significance of the ordinality of 6 is enhanced by its relation to the unfolding of 6ths in varying time-spans over the course of measures 101 and 133. Considering such factors as texture, register shifts, sequences, phrasing, and ultimate dominant prolongation, it can be seen how this large span, un- folding a 3rd from d1 to b6 1, may be subdivided into two smaller ones, from measures 101 to 116, and 117 to 133, respectively. The former is sketched in Example 14. Observe the various occurrences of 6ths here: (1) the upper voice motion from d3 to f2 (measures 103 to 105); (2) the resolution of this interval to c2 - eL1 (measures 109 to 110); (3) the relation between the 6th-ness of the diminutions and the prominent 6ths of the main motive; and (4) the imitation in the bass, measures 111 to 113, of (1) above. Register changes are primarily responsible for the sense of individuationhere; Mozart departs from the regis- trally significant d2 in measure 100, and regains this register only with the equally significant db2 in measure 126. Register changes inthis section also tend to aurally differentiate it from the succeeding one of measures 117 to 133, which is presented in Example 15. The upper voice line (from measure 117) continues the descend- ing motion in a much smoother fashion, but its very smooth- ness tends to cover a small but important nuance. In measures 123 and 124, the contrapuntal sequence of 10 - 7 is broken by an apparent resolution of eb1 to dl. But since the true resolu- tion involves eb2, measure 123, and d62, measure 126, the voice-leading seems to turn back upon itself with the move from d1 to e - f2. In other words, the apparent resolution of ebL to d1 in measures 123 to 124, together with the upper voice motion of e2 - f2, suggests an event of a somewhat parentheti- cal character, enhanced perhaps by the recurrence of register shift precisely at this moment. For this reason, the overall shape of the melodic span of measures 117 to 132, while ul- timately revealing a 6th (ab2 - c2), is not a mere augmentation of the 6th-shapes of the diminutions observed herein, but con- tains, as an essential component of the rhetoric of this passage, the subtly individuated moment described above. (The connec- tion of c to bb 1 is indicated, traditionally, with a slur, rather than continuing the middleground beam which belongs, in this case, only to the last part of the development section.) This final example illustrates, perhaps more unequivocally than the preceding ones, the underlying premise of this article, and one which I pointed out in its opening page: that of the primacy of shape over function. In contemplating Example 15, one should especially bear this point of view in mind. Thus I</page><page sequence="21">185 attach more significance to the pervasive descending 6th-shapes than to the fact that, from the point of view of traditional har- mony, the second note in each of these shapes is the one which is functional. The situation in measure 123 is easily explained: the first tone (F) is locally significant as the initial member of the 6th-shape, while the second tone (E6) is melodically sig- nificant over the whole span (indicated by the long beam). Sim- ilarly, while G6 is an important member of the 6th-shapes in measures 126 and 128, I do not consider that its presence cre- ates a change of harmony. I do consider, however, the primacy of shape to be integral to the idea of Steigerung. V. Conclusion The procedure used here calls to mind these words of Boulez: The consequences of which we can have an intuition are really perceived through study of the morphological struc- tures, to begin with; then one enlarges that first plane to encompass the whole structure; then, studying the mode of the begetting of these various planes of the structure, their interrelationships - that is, in gradually generalizing step by step - one may come to describe what, properly speak- ing, makes up the course of the work. *31 I have tried to concentrate here on Steigerung as a formative process of a special sort: a process which not only relates the small to the large, but the unique to the normative. I have all along, then, and inescapably, been talking about the rhythm of form (if rhythm is understood in Dewey's sense as ordered variation of change). This is ultimately what Steigerung and Polaritat, or individuation and involvement, are all about. Goethe writes about the idea of disparateness enhancing unity, and the relation between differentiated parts and a "complete" composition. Steigerung should, accordingly, be ineffective in compositions where contrast of various sorts is minimal, where there is, in other words, a less noticeable dialectic be- tween divisiveness and unity. Perhaps this is why we like Mo- zart's sonatas for different reasons than why we like Bach's English Suites. But this only reminds us of something men- tioned earlier: that Steigerung is only one of many possible aesthetic constituents of organic form in tonal music.</page><page sequence="22">186 EXAMPLE 14 15 3F S 7 o 7 o iL , . - . ,o L A p F:FFFF FF il</page><page sequence="23">187 REFER E N C E S 1 Nichts ist der Natur gemisser, als das sie das, was sie im Ganzen intention- iert, durch das Einzelnste in Wirksamkeit setzt.

Wie kann man sagen, Mozart habe seinen 'Don Juan" komponiert! "Komposition" - als ob es ein Stiick Kuchen. . . wire, das man aus Eiern, Mehl und Zucker zusammen- rihrt! - Eine geistige Schopfung ist es, das Einzelne wie das Ganze aus einem Geiste und Guss und von dem Hauche eines Lebens durchdrungen, wobei der produzierende keineswegs versuchte und stiickelte und nach Willkiir verfuhr, sondern wobei der dimonische Geist seines Genies ihn in der Gewalt hatte, so dass es ausfiihren musste, was jener gebot.
