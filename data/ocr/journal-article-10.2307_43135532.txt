Kankpeyeng xJL 7 'Jú Abstract The archaeology of Ghana north of 10 degrees remains little known , thus between 2004 and 2009 archaeological research was completed in the Tong Hills , the home of the Talensi ethno-linguistic group. An overview of the research is presented here with especial emphasis placed on the ceramic traditions and chronology. These are contextualised within the archaeology of the wider region of northern Ghana. Résumé L'archéologie de Ghana au-delà de 10° N reste mécon- nue, c 'est pourquoi une recherche archéologique a été menée entre 2004 et 2009 dans les collines Tong, la ré- gion du groupe ethno-linguistique Talensi. C'est une vue d'ensemble de cette recherche qui est présentée ici avec un intérêt particulier pour les traditions céramiques et la chronologie. Celles-ci sont replacées dans le contexte plus large de l 'archéologie du nord du Ghana.

Introduction The Tong Hills are a small range of hills of ca 4 km north-south by 3 km east-west located in the Upper East Region of northern Ghana (Fig. 1 ) and are inhabited by the Talensi ethno-linguistic group. The ceramic data discussed here was generated as part of a research project, "The Archaeology of Ritual, Shrines and Sac- rifice in Northern Ghana" (Insoll 2007, 2008a, 2008b, 2010a; Insoll et al. 2009). This is a collaborative re- search project between the Universities of Manchester and Ghana. The aims of the project are various and include exploring the material culture, definitions and archaeological signatures of religious phenomena such as earth and ancestral cults, and recording the material- ity of shrines of various types. A further focus of the research has been establishing a basic chronology and pottery sequence for the Tong Hills, and the discus- sion presented in this article derives from this aspect of the project. This is important, as to date no Iron Age ceramic sequences have been published from north of 10 degrees in Ghana, the primary focus of this discus- sion, besides a partial assemblage from Yikpabongo in Northern Region (see Anquandah 1998: 101-114). No archaeological research had been completed in the Tong Hills until the start of the current project in 2004, but the Talensi had been the focus of extensive anthropological research completed by Meyer Fortes (Fortes 1945, 1949). Fortes was implicitly linked with structural functionalist approaches within anthropol- ogy, the correlates of which included, for instance, a lack of interest in material culture, and ahistoricism (Fardon 2005: 74-75; Insoll 2010b: 572). Conversely, political structures and kinship were given especial research focus. The current research thus serves to at- tempt, in a small way, to redress the "imbalance" noted by Rowlands (2007 : 66), in that we know "virtually nothing in fine-grain detail of the archaeology of vast tracts of west central Africa" that formed the ethno- graphic "backbone for British structural functionalist anthropology". To a lesser extent ethnoarchaeological (Gabrilopoulos 1995; Gabrilopóulos et al. 2002), and historical (Allman &amp; Parker 2005) research had also been completed in the Tong Hills, focusing on, respec- tively, house construction (see also Eyifa 2007), and the history of a major earth Shrine, Tongnaab. The Talensi are subsistence agriculturalists who speak Talen, a Gur language of the Oti-Volta group (Naden 1988: 12). Talensi society is divided into two main groups of clans, the Namoos who live at the base of the Hills in the vicinity of the town of Tongo, and the Hill Talis (Fortes 1945). The Talis are according to oral tradition the autochthonous inhabitants of the region (Fortes 1987: 43) and said to have 'sprung from the earth itself'. This is a reference to their role as ritual custodians of the earth, and thus they constitute the earth priest clans. In contrast the Namoos, again according to oral tradition, are credited with bringing the institution of chieftainship to the Talis via their an- cestor Musuor (Fortes 1950: 245-246). The Namoos trace their origins to Mamprugu, an area (and kingdom) associated with the Mamprusi ethno-linguistic group, some 30 km southeast of the Tong Hills. When the crea- tion of the Talensi occurred is difficult to reconstruct and archaeology has not contributed to this. Settlement chronologies have been reconstructed, but they do not provide any information on migration history and eth- nogenesis. Fortes (1987: 43) suggests that the immigra- tion from Mamprugu occurred some fourteen to fifteen generations ago from a base line of the 1930s^40s (the era of his research). This would suggest a possible pe- riod of approximately 300 years, giving a conjectural date of ca 1650 (Insoll 2006: 225). The archaeology of northern Ghana The Iron Age archaeology of northern Ghana gener- ally remains unknown with comparatively little re- search completed in the relevant Upper East, Upper West and Northern administrative regions (Stahl 1994; Insoll 2008a). A similar situation exists in southern and southwestern Burkina Faso (Madiega &amp; Nao 2003) that shares contiguous ethno-linguistic groups as with the Lobi and Dagarti in the Upper West Region and the Kasena in the Upper East Region. This is unfortunate, for to better understand both the archaeology and ceram- ics of northern Ghana it is necessary to also look beyond the modern national boundaries. As Craven (2008: 3) notes with reference to modern potting traditions, these "in northern Ghana form a continuum with those across the borders into Burkina Faso to the west and north, Ivory coast to the west and Togo to the east". There is, for example, an absence of corroborative archaeology in the Mamprugu region, owing to a lack of research on the Iron Age. Instead, focus has been placed upon the Late Stone Age that is so far unrep- resented in the Tong Hills (e.g. Casey 2000; Watson 2008). The research on the Iron Age that was completed under the auspices of the Gambaga Archaeological Re- search Project has only been described in brief. Kense (1992: 153) refers to the sites of Gambaga andNalerigu (Fig. 7), the former linked with the Namoos, as not much older than the mid-second millennium AD. One site, Abangoyiri, is described as dated to the twelfth century AD (ibid.). This was on the trade route leading down the Gambaga Escarpment to the River Volta and thus in the direction of the Tong Hills. Its date and func- tion make it of significant importance for comparative purposes but the absence of publication precludes its effective utilisation in discussion. 16 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (1), 2011</page><page sequence="3">The Iron Age Ceramics from the Tong Hills Fig. 1. The locations in northern Ghana of the main archaeological sites discussed (redrawn from Kankpeyeng &amp; Nkumbaan 2009: 194). In general, based on available data, occupation in northern Ghana in the first through mid-second mil- lennia AD, the period represented by the Tong Hills sequence (see below), appears to have been widely scattered. In the far west, Saako (2009) has investi- gated the site of Birifoh-Sila Yiri where he excavated a sequence of plastered floors and potsherd pavements (Fig. /), the remains of a compound, as well as a burial covered with potsherds that he suggests on the basis of ethnographic data was of a female. The site and se- quence remains undated but Saako (2009: xix) consid- ers that "the settlement probably dates to between the 6th and 1 1th centuries AD, a date inferred from similar features and ceramics found in other West African sites". It is noteworthy that Birifoh, though neglected archaeologically, was another of the Northern Ghana foci of extensive formative British anthropological research, in this instance by Jack Goody (e.g. Goody 1962, 1967). Other archaeological research in northern Ghana has been focused on material of later date, and is thus beyond the comparative scope of the Tong Hills se- quence that finishes in ca AD 1500 (discussed below). For example, Nkumbaan (2008) has completed re- search on the archaeology of nineteenth century slav- ery at Kasana, 16 km northeast of Tumu in the Upper West Region. Excavations were completed in the mar- ket square and the slave master's quarters. Similarly Swanepoel (2008) has examined historical archaeology and geography in Sisalaland, 60 km south of Tumu with a particular focus on the village of Dolbizan and Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (1), 2011 17</page><page sequence="4">T. Insoll et al. its nineteenth century predecessor hilltop refuge settle- ment of Yalingbong. Further to the west in the Upper West Region Kankpeyeng (2003) has investigated the Kantosi settlement site of Kpaliworgu that has a recon- structed occupation sequence from the mid-seventeenth century to abandonment ca 1900. Aside from the Tong Hills project, the most sig- nificant research focused upon the period before 1800 that has been completed in northern Ghana has been in Koma Land. This archaeological region covers an area of approximately 100 x 100 km within the basins of the Kulpawn and Sisili rivers (Fig. 1). Excavations were first completed in the mid 1 980s by Anquandah ( 1 987, 1 998) at the site of Yikpabongo in Koma Land, and renewed research has taken place since 2006 (Kankpeyeng &amp; Nkumbaan 2009). Initially the mounds at Yikpabongo were interpreted as burial mounds and dated to between caAD 1200 to 1800 (Anquandah 1998: 103-109). This has now been revised with the mounds interpreted as possibly being the remains of shrines (Kankpeyeng &amp; Nkumbaan 2009: 201), perhaps functioning in the con- text of healing (Kankpeyeng et al. in press), and dated to between the sixth and early fourteenth centuries (ibid.). Yikpabongo and other Koma Land sites are famous for the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic clay figurines re- covered in large numbers from them (Anquandah 1998; Insoll &amp; Kankpeyeng in press). These are unique finds in northern Ghana, absent elsewhere in the region. The archaeology of the Tong Hills Field surrey Field survey of the Tong Hills has been completed (Insoll et al. 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008) indicating that it was an intensively occupied area that has had a retrac- tion of settlement in the present. This is clearly indi- cated by sites on the flanks of the Hills as at Sumpelalak in Sameet section and on the eastern edge of the hilltop plateau as in the Tambog and Gundari sections where abandoned agricultural terracing and compounds have been recorded (Insoll et al. 2005, 2006, manuscript in preparation [1]) (Fig. 2). It is likely that soil erosion and land degradation were major factors contributing to this process of site abandonment that occurred, according to local inhabitants, up until the 1980s. At present further settlement retraction is not taking place and the plateau at the centre of the Hills is extensively occupied and divided into seven sections (Fig. 3). The excavations , site chronologies , and the implications for the ceramics Subsequent to the surveys, excavations were also com- pleted at various locations on the Hills and at its south- eastern foot. Twenty excavation units of varying sizes were completed; six in abandoned compounds and Fig. 2.

The majority of the units were trial excavations of 2 X 2 m size that produced little material. Hence the focus of the discussion is upon eight larger units excavated at three sites, the Nyoo Earth Shrine, an abandoned compound at Touwang, and at the iron- working site of Zandoya (Fig. 2). The site dates cluster into two periods with little overlap and these dates are underscored by differences in the pottery. It is evident from the dates obtained that the chronology at Nyoo, and those from Zandoya and Touwang differ (Tab. 1). The latter two are best treated together as their ceramics are similar. Overall, the ceramic chronologies are for Nyoo, the second Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (1), 2011 19</page><page sequence="6">T. Insoll et al.

The shallow depth of the archaeological deposits at all the sites indicated no chronological phasing within. The absence of any tobacco pipes would concur with the reconstructed site chronologies as tobacco smoking has been suggested as being introduced to northern Ghana in the early to mid seventeenth century (Shinnie &amp; Kense 1989: 159). The Nyoo Shrine The Nyoo earth shrine is a large 'sacred grove' and an active ritual centre in the southeast of the Tong Hills (Insoll 2007). It is almost entirely covered with ar- chaeological remains that form three distinct zones. First, an area some 200 m north to south formed of stone arrangements and spreads of pottery. Second, slightly to the north, an area of standing stones produced from vari- ous rock types including Leocratic and Bongo granites and meta-chert (Baneong-Yakubo 2006). These stand on average 60-80 cm above ground and 143 whole and fragmentary examples were recorded. The third area in the Nyoo shrine is the contemporary place of sacrifice and lacked visible archaeology (Insoll et al. 2009). NYOO 05 and 06 (A). A test pit of 1 .5 x 1 .5 m (NYOO 05 [A]) was excavated in 2005 in the area of stone ar- rangements and this was extended into a unit (NY OO 06 [A]) of 8 x 4 m in 2006 (N10°40.310' W000°48.392'). Seven stone arrangements were delimited surrounded by shallow archaeological deposits, predominantly of potsherds, of 15-20" cm depth (Fig. 4). The pot layer would seem to have been deposited after the stone ar- rangements were laid (Insoll et al. 2009: 48). An OSL date was obtained from the pot filled layer (Tab. 1). There are no contemporary analogues for this pot depo- sition, or for their association with stone arrangements, and the interpretation of their function is returned to below. The latter were almost entirely formed of a sin- gle layer of stones between 16 and 51 in number and removal of one of these (SA 1) and excavation below to the orange brown natural gravel at a depth of 45 cm produced very little material in comparison to the infill between them. The function of the stone arrangements is unknown. Based on analogy with the use of similar stone settings today it is possible that chiefs, elders and priests used them as meeting or assembly places (Insoll 2009). Again based on ethnographic analogy they might also provide an insight into past movement, perform- ance, and associated ritual action, through being used to structure movement, conceivably dance (ibid.). NYOO 05 and 06 (B). A second test pit of 1 x 1 m (NYOO 05 [A]) was excavated in the area of standing stones and this was extended into a unit of 6 x 4 m (NYOO 06 [B]) (N10°40.328' W000°48.398'). Twelve clusters of either paired or single standing stones were within the unit boundaries. A shallow layer of 7-8 cm maximum depth from surface, containing potsherds, iron bracelets and points, and stone grinders or rubbers, was present (Insoll et al. 2007: 52). Subsequently, thirteen complete and one partially complete pot were recorded in situ below, slightly adjacent, and approxi- mately north, of the standing stones at a depth of be- tween 12-23.5 cm (Fig. 5). These were left in situ , as the local community did not want them disturbed. An OSL date (X2846) was obtained from below one of the pots (Tab. 1). The complete vessels included nine flared mouth bowls, one spherical or flared mouth bowl (the presence of a potsherd lid made precise identifica- tion impossible), two short collar necked jars and one hemispherical bowl (Insoll et al. 2009: 55-56). Three further pots were removed before their contextual as- sociation with the standing stones had become clear and these comprised a hemispherical bowl, flared mouth bowl, and spherical bowl. No archaeological material was recovered from below a depth of 40 cm and an OSL date (X2847) was obtained from the base of the deposits (Tab. 1). Standing stones are not now erected and their function is unknown, but it was suggested by Talensi elders that the pots might have been associated with ancestral veneration (Insoll et al. 2009). Zandoya Zandoya, meaning "take your throwing stick", seem- ingly a reference to preparation for war (Insoll et al. 2008: 13), is situated to the southeast of the Tong Hills on its lowest slopes in the vicinity of the contemporary village of Yinduri. The site is composed of various 20 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (1), 2011</page><page sequence="7">The Iron Age Ceramics from the Tong Hills Fig. 4.

Three units were excavated. ZAN 08 (A). A2 X 2 m unit was excavated on the southern side of the quartz mound (N10°39.387' W000°49.155'). The quartz flakes had been deliberately deposited. Along with slag, potsherds, and other materials, they formed a densely packed deposit until 21-30 cm below the sur- face (ZAN 08 [A] 5) when their frequency declined.

This mound of material had been constructed over a stone platform, part of which was exposed during the excavations. Several large potsherds were recorded on top of this platform that had been compressed down and crushed in situ (Fig. 7). An OSL date was obtained from this deposit (Tab. 1). The whole mound was surrounded or edged with, on the surface, large boulders, and be- low a tightly compressed mass of rock and potsherds forming almost a dry-stone wall. Natural gravel was recorded at a variable depth of 1 5^0 cm, allowing for the slope of the mound (Fig. 8). ZAN 08 (B). This unit of 2 x 2 m was placed in the settlement area (N10°39.795' W000°49.159'). The ar- chaeological deposits were again comparatively shal- low reaching a maximum depth of 40-50 cm before the natural orange gravel and granite bedrock was reached (Fig. 9).

The pots recorded included a vessel analogous with a kpolung vessel used today for straining or steaming dawadawa (African locust bean; Parida biglobosa ) pods. This had been interred upside down and slightly above it were seven collar neck jars of various sizes, one flared mouth bowl, one spherical bowl and one spherical jar (Fig. 10). OSL dates were obtained both from the matrix surrounding the kpolung pot (ZAN 08 [B] 1 8) and from the base of the layer containing the other complete pots (ZAN 08 [B] 4) (Tab. 1). ZAN 08 (C). A test pit of 1 x 1 m was excavated in a slag mound at the southern end of the site (N 1 0°39.773 ' W000°49.164'). The initial deposits to a depth of ca 5 cm were composed of a compacted slag and potsherd crust as the soil had been washed out.

At a depth of between 25-26 cm a pit was encountered on the western side of the unit, with natural granite bed- rock reached at a depth of 38-44 cm (Fig. 11). An OSL date was obtained from the pit deposits (Tab. 1 ). Touwang Three units were excavated in an area of abandoned settlement at Touwang in Tamboog section at the north- eastern end of the Tong Hills (Fig. 12).

It is also an area with extensive complexes of (undated) refuge caves and rock shelters that are probably linked with historical narratives of disruption and insecurity associated with slave-raiding, warfare and colonial mili- tary action {e.g. Allman &amp; Parker 2005: 63-65) in the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. TOU 08 (A). A 4 X 3 m unit was excavated in what was in- terpreted as part of a collapsed earthen house (N 1 0°40.949' W000°48.235'). The interior of the house was filled with hard daub deposits that gave way to friable grit filled matrix beneath. The depth of the archaeological deposits varied between 5 cm outside the structure to 45 cm at the base of a test pit in the interior of the house (Insoll et al. manuscript in preparation [1]). A single young adult inhumation, placed in a horizontal crouched position, with the face to the east, gender unclear, was recorded in the entrance to the house {Fig. 13). This seemed to be con- temporary with the structure though a distinct grave cut was difficult to discern. An OSL date was obtained from next to the thighbone of the skeleton {Tab. 1). TOU 08 (C). Unit TOU 08 (B) was not excavated, hence its absence in the site code sequence. TOU 08 C, a unit of ca 1.5 m x 50 cm, was excavated in a dense concen- tration of potsherds in a cleft underneath a large Bongo granite boulder (co-ordinates as TOU 08 [A]) {Fig. 14). 26 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (1), 2011</page><page sequence="13">The Iron Age Ceramics from the Tong Hills Fig. 15. Features exposed, TOU 08 (D). The layering of the sherds and their deliberate hiding in a concealed location would seem to indicate that this was a disposal context for medicine pots (Kobina Tendaan pers. comm. 19/3/08; Insoll in press). The pot deposits were approximately 30 cm deep and an OSL date was obtained from a depth of 20 cm {Tab. 1). TOU 08 (D). This was a unit of 2 x 2 m placed to in- vestigate a small schist standing stone of ca 40 cm total length (N10°40.921' W000°48.247'). The maximum depth of the archaeological deposits was 16-22 cm (Fig. 75).The presence of the standing stone was inter- preted by Talensi informants as functioning as a marker where something of value (not found or surviving) had been hidden (Insoll et al. 2008: 17). Ceramics methodology Owing to the ubiquity of ceramics and comparative ab- sence of other materials, emphasis was placed on their recording. This was especially significant considering the absence of prior research across northern Ghana as previously described.

All potsherds were ini- tially sorted according to size and those under 2 cm were removed, counted, and discarded (Tab. 2). Sherds over 2 cm in size were separated into rim and body sherds. Rim sherds were examined individually for vessel form, rim morphology, rim diameter, body thickness and fab- ric, and decoration. Body sherds were divided into deco- rated and undecorated and the undecorated body sherds were checked for fabric, counted, and bagged. Decorated body sherds were separated according to decorative techniques and this and the fabrics recorded. Variable quantities of body sherds were eroded which limited the information they provided and these along with uneroded plain sherds were recorded as "indistinct/plain" (2006) or "undiagnostic" (2008). Ceri Ashley established the initial ceramic typology in 2006 (Ashley 2006), and this was subsequently expanded and refined. All the ceramic material is now stored in the Upper East Regional Mu- seum, Bolgatanga, Ghana. Decorative techniques Eight decorative techniques were represented in the ce- ramics assemblage. The decorative techniques present in the Nyoo assemblage were Twisted String Rou- lette (TGR) and Knotted Strip Roulette (KPR), Cord Wrapped Stick (CWS), Incised, Cord Impressed, and Embossed. Two additional decorative techniques were represented in the Zandoya and Touwang assemblages, Burnished, and Red Slipped. Twisted String Roulette (TGR) Examination of large vessels where the angle/orientation of the roulette pattern was evident, i.e. as horizontal or diagonal in relation to the vessel shape, indicated that a small finely twisted string was being used to produce the very thin and regularly linear string impressed roulette classified as TGR following Soper (1985: 35). It could be used in conjunction with KPR, CWS, as an all over decorative technique on its own, in bands on its own, within incised bands, in bands with comb impressed decoration, in herringbone patterns, and in herringbone patterns along with incision (Figs. 16, 7 7 and 18).

Knotted Strip Roulette (KPR) Again following Soper (1985: 37), decoration with more angular oblique parallel lines of roulette impres- sions was defined as Knotted Strip Roulette (KPR). It is also equivalent to the Braided Strip Roulette defined by Haour et al. (2010). It could be used in conjunction with TGR, as an all over decorative tech- nique on its own, in bands on its own, within incised bands, and in herringbone patterns (Figs. 16, 17 and 19). Cord Wrapped Stick Roulette (CWS) This decorative technique differed from TGR and KPR/ Braided Strip Roulette and was defined on the basis 28 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (1), 2011 - NYOO 06 (B) 5 [A4] - NYOO 06 (B) 5 [B3] V 1 WWm NYOO 06 (B) 5 [A4] NYOO 06 (B) 5 [B3] Flared mouth bowl - Short collar neck jar - ▼ TGR &amp; Embossed TGR, Embossed appliqué &amp; incisions crm " NYOO 05 (A) 3 [3] Collar neck jar - Allover TGR 5cm U 5cm 5cm NYOO 05 (A) 3 [6] NYOO 06 (B) 5 [A3] . .......

It was recorded at Nyoo (A and B) and at Zandoya (A and C) but not at Touwang. CWS decoration was composed of impressed horizontal lines (Fig. 16) or horizontal lines and crescents (Figs. 20 and 21) usually on the shoulder. CWS was found associated with herringbone TGR (NYOO 06 [B] 4 [D5] [16]), TGR and embossed decoration (NYOO 05 [A] 8), and incised decoration (NYOO 06 [B] 4). Incised Incision was found used on its own or in combination with TGR and KPR to form defined bands of the lat- ter (Fig. 19). Where used on its own the predominant pattern was of a chevron design (Fig. 16). The tools used to produce the incisions are not known but in one instance fingernails had been utilised to create vertical impressions (Figs. 21 and 22). On two examples from NYOO (B) it was difficult to differentiate incision from cord impression (e.g. NYOO 06 [B] A3 [3]). Comb impressed Rectangular or square comb impressions of between less than 1 mm and 2 mm size were recorded at all sites, though were rare at NYOO (B) (see below). This was used in various ways and could be found on the rim and body, rim, body, or neck alone. As single or multiple lines of impressions in horizontal or geomet- ric patterns formed of comb impressed bands (TOU 08 [A] 1), or dragged to form a zig-zag effect (Fig. 21). Comb impression was also utilised on appliqué clay cords applied to the neck of some vessels (ZAN 08 [B] 5), or used in conjunction with incision (Figs. 21 and 23), TGR at Zandoya (ZAN 08 [B] 4) and Touwang (TOU 08 (A) 9) but not at Nyoo, and KPR (NYOO 06 [A] 5 [A7]). Embossed Limited quantities of sherds were decorated with four sub-categories of embossed clay decorations always in association with other decorative techniques (Figs. 16, Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (1), 2011 29</page><page sequence="16">T. Insoll et al. Fig. 21. Decorative techniques and vessel types. 19 and 21). Hence it has not been treated as a separate category in the quantitative analysis. Single circular dots (Fig. 19), double or multiple dots (Fig. 16 ), elon- gated rounded shapes (ZAN 08 [B] 4), or as embossed appliqué clay cord with comb impression, indents, or incisions (Fig. 21). Burnished A burnished surface was created using the colour of the underlying fabric. Three colours of burnished pot were recorded, black (TOU 08 [A] 6), dark and light brown as interior burnish (TOU 08 [A] 3 and ZAN 08 [A] 4), and red (ZAN 08 [A] 2) again as an interior burnish. The latter was difficult to differentiate from red slip. No other decorative techniques were recorded with burnishing except for all over comb impression on the un-burnished exterior of the vessel with the red burnished interior. Red slipped A thin red slip was recorded applied on both interior and exterior (ZAN 08 [A] 2) or interior alone (TOU 08 [A] 4), and in association with incised decoration (TOU 08 [C] 2), TGR (ZAN 08 [A] 4), and TGR and incised decoration (ZAN 08 [C] 3). Quantitative analysis has, for ease of reference, been split into rims and rims and body sherds in re- gard to decorative techniques (Tab. 3) but the latter are the focus of interpretation here (Tad. 4). Three main decorative techniques dominate the assemblages, TGR, KPR, and to a lesser extent comb impression. All over TGR decoration is the most common deco- rative technique, especially at NYOO (A), 35.7 % and NYOO (B), 41 %, but less frequent at Zandoya (18.8 %) and Touwang (14.8 %). Similar patterning is evident for the combinations and varieties of TGR 30 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (1), 2011 5cm ~5cm "" ^Cm 5cm ZAN 08(B) 16 [1] ZAN 08 (A) 4 [5] ZAN 08(B) 4 [2] ZAN 08 (A) 3 [6] Spherical jar, R2 - R4- Collar neck jar, R7 - Comb impressed Comb impressed Comb impressed Embossed appliqué strip // 5cm """" f 5cm ZAN 08 (A) 4 [4] ZAN 08(B) 8 [1] TOU 08(D) 2 [1] R3 - Spherical jar, R1 2 - Pedestal base - 5cm Incised with fingernail TGR, embossed, incised Incised NYOO 06 (A) 5 (A8.2) Perforated base - Comb impressed 2s ) 5cm 5cm - 5cm ZAN 08 (A) 4 [1] NYOO 06 (B) 4 [C6] ZAN 08 (A) 4 [3] Pedestal base - Short collar neck jar - Steaming/smoking vessel, 56a - Incised, comb impressed CWS TGR, embossed, incised</page><page sequence="17">The Iron Age Ceramics from the Tong Hills Fig. 22.

The frequency of comb impression as a decorative tech- nique is generally lower, but was higher at Touwang (5.8 %) than at Zandoya (2 %), and very low at NYOO (A), 0.2 % and NYOO (B), 0.0 %. Other decorative tech- niques are only represented in very small quantities with, for example, burnishing only present at Zandoya (0.0 %) and Touwang (0.2 %), as was red slipping at 0.4 % and 0.7 % respectively at these sites. Rim types and diameters Three categories of rim types were identified, Rounded, Over-hanging, and Squared {Fig. 24). These rim types were present at all the sites. The most common rim type was the Rounded rims, followed by the Squared rims at Zandoya and Nyoo, and Over-hanging rims at Zandoya {Tab. 5). Rounded rims Twelve sub-categories of Rounded rim were identified (Fig. 24). Of these R1 was most common at NYOO (A) at 26.6 %, R7 at NYOO (B) at 30.8 %, and R3 at both Zandoya (28.9 %) and Touwang (33.3 %). Over-hanging rims Six sub-categories of Over-hanging rim were identified (Fig. 24). All sites vary as to which sub-category domi- nated; Sub-category Ol dominated at all sites; NYOO (A), 41.7 %, NYOO (B), 75 %, Zandoya (50 %), and Touwang (82.6 %). Squared rims Eleven sub-categories of Squared rim were identified (Fig. 24). S 1 at NYOO (A) at 3 1 .3 %, S6 at NYOO (B) at 23.8 %, S2 at Zandoya at 45.7 %, and S5 at Touwang at 30.8 %. Rim diameters ranged in size between 3 and 56 cm, and there was a significant difference in rim diameters evident at the different sites. At NYOO (A) and (B), when combined, rim diameters of greater than 15 cm constituted 80.6 % of the total rim assemblage, and individually were 79.8 % at NYOO (A) and 83.4 % at NYOO (B). In comparison, at Zandoya these were 10.3 % and at Touwang no sherds of a larger rim diam- eter than 14 cm were recorded. The possible functional implications of this difference are discussed below. Vessel forms Initially in the 2006 season, an attempt was made to link all the rim sherds to the eight complete vessel types identified (Fig. 25). This was subsequently abandoned in the 2008 season owing to reservations about recon- structing vessel form from small rim fragments that often lacked the shoulder, or shoulder and body. Hence 32 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (1), 2011</page><page sequence="19">The Iron Age Ceramics from the Tong Hills Fig. 25. Vessel forms. making comparisons based on the presence or absence of vessel forms between the NYOO (A) and (B), and Zandoya and Touwang assemblages is not particularly meaningful and thus was omitted from the quantitative analysis. Five pedestal bases were also found (NYOO [A] = 2; Touwang = 1 ; Zandoya = 2), and two other base fragments (NY 00 [A] = 1 ; Zandoya = 1), it is not known which vessel form they were linked with. Flared mouth bowl The body of this vessel is spherical/rounded but at the neck the rim flares out to give a slightly S-shaped profile (Figs. 16 and 25). Hemispherical bowl This is a bowl with a large open neck and with a hemi- spherical profile and a rounded base (Figs. 16 and 25). Restricted mouth bowl The lower part of the body is similar to the hemispheri- cal bowl but the neck is much more restricted (Figs. 16 and 25). Carinated bowl This is a very rare vessel form being confined to a single example (NYOO 05 [A] 2). It has a keel-shaped body with an over-hanging rim of 16 cm diameter and based on its rarity it is possible that it is an experiment, or a deviation from a restricted mouth bowl (Fig. 25). Spherical bowl The body shape of this bowl is similar to the flared mouth bowl but lacks the latter having a simpler slight- ly in-turned rim (Figs. 16 and 25). Collar neck jar This vessel form is defined by the neck which forms a distinct collar between the body and rim. This can be relatively short (NY OO 06 [B] 4 [C6]) or of a longer length (ZAN 08 [B] 4 [2]; Figs. 16, 20 and 25). Everted neck jar This is another rare vessel form with four examples identified (three from NYOO 06 [A] 5, one from ZAN 08 [C] 3). It is characterised by a sharply everted neck (Fig. 25). Spherical jar This is a vessel form only identified in the assemblages from ZAN 08 (B) and ZAN 08 (C). It is characterised by a spherical body and a relatively small rim diameter with R12 type rims predominating at five out of 10 examples recorded (Figs. 20 and 25). Fabrics, pot manufacture , and pétrographie analysis Fabric colour was found to be very variable and no attempt was made to standardise fabric colour descrip- tion, for example with a Munsell Soil Colour Chart, as the range of variation seen in the fabric colours when wet and then when dry rendered this largely worthless (Insoll 1996: 111). Fabrics have been divided into three categories, fine, medium, and coarse. Fabric type has been defined on the basis of temper type and frequency (here meaning any non-plastic inclusions). Fine is defined as containing inclusions of sand (i.e. quartz), grit (all other non-plastics) or, rarely, organic material of less than 0.5 mm in size. Medium is defined as containing inclusions of 0.5-2 mm, and coarse as containing inclusions of over 2 mm. The dominant fabric type that constituted the majority of the assem- blage was from a mixed oxidised/unoxidised firing environment creating a varied orange brown to black colour. Notable was the high quantity of opaque white quartz inclusions (ea 1-2 mm) and occasional larger pink- white quartzite granules (ca 1-3 mm) and ferrous red inclusions (ca 2 mm). This suggests the utilisation of similar raw materials and tempering procedures, but with some micro-variation evident (e.g. the ferrous and quartzite inclusions [Fraser &amp; Gibbs 2010]). The manufacturing technique employed to produce the pots could not be discerned for most examples ow- ing to abrasion on the interior of the vessels and manu- facturing marks, if any, being obscured by decoration or finishing on the exterior. Where it was identifiable, for example, on a Flared Mouth Bowl decorated with TGR and incision (ZAN 08 (C) 3 [4]) coil forming was evident through the marks left by smoothing out the coils on the interior (Fig. 26). Nine sherds from Nyoo (NY OO 06 [A] = 7 from excavations, 1 surface collection (S/C); NYOO 06 [B] = 1) were thin-sectioned and their petrography analysed by SEM (Fraser &amp; Gibbs 2010; Tab 6). This indicated that they shared a fine-grained clay matrix and con- tained non-plastic inclusions, primarily mineral grains Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (1), 2011 33 ) Flared mouth bowl M ' J Ě ' Collar neck jar 1^) Restricted mouth bowl Everted neck jar Carinated bowl Spherical bowl ■ ' Spherical jar J Hermispherical bowl J</page><page sequence="20">T. Insoll et al. Fig. 26. Coil forming marks on interior of a flared mouth bowl (ZAN 08 (C) 3 [4]). with quartz and plagioclase found in all samples. Less frequent inclusions were organics (seed or bone), pos- sibly slag, and argillaceous materials. The latter may be fragments of crushed pottery (grog - Fig. 27), as well as natural clay pellets (Fraser &amp; Gibbs 2010: 36). Eight of the nine samples analysed can be sorted into a broad pétrographie group characterized by the pres- ence of typically sub-angular to sub-rounded poorly sorted quartz, generally less than 2 mm in size. The exception is NYOO 06 (A)5 (A3) that has a smaller amount of larger sub-angular quartz grains and a clear bimodal distribution throughout the matrix of very small quartz grains (-1/1 6th mm). The poor sorting and non-angular grain shape of most of the inclusions suggests they were not added as intentional temper by the potter and instead a clay source with abundant mineral inclusions exploited. It is also possible that the low quantities of non-mineral inclusions were intro- duced unintentionally into the clay during processing. The exception being NYOO 06 (A)5 (A3) (Fraser &amp; Gibbs 2010: 39, 44). Discussion: the Tong Hills ceramics in regional context As previously stated, comparative material from north- ern Ghana is scarce (Insoll 2008a: 87-88), but the situation has improved slightly since the late 1980s when Shinnie &amp; Kense (1989: 56) noted that only three sites had been excavated in the whole northern half of the country. The limitations of the data available on the assemblages of Iron Age ceramics recovered from excavations completed during the Gambaga Archaeo- logical Research Project have been outlined. Kense (1992: 151) observes that overall the pottery of the post-Kintampo period is "not characterized by any clearly diagnostic styles" (ibid. : 1 50), and that little pot- tery was painted in contrast to the ceramics from sites such as Daboya in the Gonja area of Northern Region (see below). This would accord with the Tong Hills assemblage where it is also absent. The ceramics from Nalerigu and Gambaga are described as decorated with punctations, incisions and stamped impressions (Kense 1992: 150), but no other information is provided. Daboya on the west bank of the White Volta River is situated approximately 160 km southwest of the Tong Hills (Fig. 1). It is an important site for ceramic comparison in northern Ghana because of its lengthy chronology from ca 2000 BC to AD 1925. Similarities between the Tong Hills and Daboya ceramics exist in relation to Daboya ceramic tradition IV, Family A and Family B, dated respectively to AD 700-1200 and AD 1000-1800 (Shinnie &amp; Kense 1989: 71). Decoratively, this is evident with, for instance, the Tradition IV A2 wares and their use of incision and roulette decoration that is very similar to the KPR and incised decorated wares recorded at Nyoo. Whilst Tradition IV B3 ped- estal bases (ibid.: 106) with their comb decoration are identical to material from Touwang and Zandoya, as is the use of red slip (ibid. : 93) with or without other decoration. There are also similarities in rim form evi- dent in comparable Squared rim forms, for example, type S4 (Fig. 24) and Tradition IV B5 (Shinnie &amp; Kense 1989: 117), and in the Rounded rim forms present, as with Tradition IV B4 (ibid.: 107, top), or in what Site Code Sherd Type Vessel Form Rim I^pe Decoration NYOO 06 (A) 5 (A7) Rim Flared mouth bowl S6a Alternating KPR and TGR, embossed NYOO 06 (B) 5 (A5) Rim Restricted mouth bowl S7 TGR, embossed NYOO 06 (A) 5 (Al) Rim Collar neck jar Ol KPR, incised, embossed, TGR NYOO 06 (A) 5 (A6) Pedestal base NK Comb impressed NYOO 06 (A) 5 (A3) Rim Flared mouth bowl R3 KPR, embossed NYOO 06 (A) 5 (A7) Rim Flared mouth bowl 02 TGR NYOO 06 (A) S/C Body NK KPR bands, embossed, incised NYOO 06 (A) 5 (A7) Rim Restricted mouth bowl S6a KPR bands, incised, embossed NYOO 06 (A) 5 (C6) Rim Collar neck jar 03 Comb impressed Tab. 6.

Example of a void around grog in sample NYOO 06 [A] 5 [A7] (ppl, field of view 4 mm; photo. S. Fraser). would be defined as Over-hanging rim forms in the Tong Hills assemblage and Tradition IV A3 (Shinnie &amp; Kense 1989: 97). Distinct differences also exist as in the absence of goblet type footed cups in the Tong Hills assemblages and of the so-called Silima wares, pottery with red painted lines on a burnished and light col- oured background and dated to AD 1300-1850 (ibid.: 112-113,72-73). It is unlikely that these ceramic parallels are rep- resentative of contacts between the Tong Hills and Daboya. However, trade routes existed in the nineteenth century between the Mossi town of Tiebele in Burkina Faso, via Baare, a main market of the Talensi near Tongo (Garrard 1986: 137), and on to the south to Dagomba and Gonja (Insoll 2003). Daboya also has northern Mande centred traditions of origin (Stahl 1994: 90; Insoll 2003: 339) presumably maintained via routes through northern Ghana. Today extensive ritual communication is maintained between Dagomba and to a lesser extent Gonja and the Tong Hills. This is linked with client-patron shrine relationships initi- ated through the process of shrine franchising from the Tongnaab shrine (Allman &amp; Parker 2005; Insoll 2006). Ceramics are not utilised in this process, but it is linked with stone, medicinal substances and animal parts (Insoll in press). The ceramics from Birifoh-Sila Yiri in Upper West Region are described as decorated with roulette, rou- lette and incision, and roulette and grooving (Saako 2009: 76). Some parallels in rim form and decoration are evident with the assemblage from the Tong Hills. The ceramics from Birifoh need further analysis but the sherds illustrated and described as having an everted rim (ibid.: Ill), and decorated with KPR/ Braided Strip Roulette, besides precise decorative parallels, are what would be described as Rounded and Over-hanging rim types in the Tong Hills typology. Saa- ko suggests a date of the sixth to eleventh centuries for Birifoh (see above), but it is essentially undated. The contextual use of ceramics differs from that of the Tong Hills. At Birifoh, potsherd pave- ments were recorded, and potsherds were used to cover a burial. The deposition of potsherds around the stòne arrangements in NYOO (A) cannot be described as a potsherd pavement, as the arrangements are too irregular (Insoll 2010c), and the single inhumation recorded at TOU 08 (A) lacked associated ceramics. Yikpabongo in Komaland also pro- vides a significant point of comparison because of similarities in chronology (see above), and geographical proximity. Yikpabongo is 120 km west of the Tong Hills. Similarities in forms exist in the pedestal bases, and hemispherical and flared mouth bowls recorded in Yikpabongo (Anquandah 1998: 105), and in the use of TGR and KPR/Braided Strip Roulette, and incision (ibid.: 108-109). However, differences also exist as in the absence in the Tong Hills of tripod or "three-footed bowls" found at Yikpabongo and interpreted as for ritual purposes (Kankpeyeng &amp; Nkumbaan 2009: 201). A 3 x 2 m test pit was also ex- cavated by one of the authors (TI) under the auspices of Kankpeyeng 's 'Koma Land Research Project' in Yikpabongo in January 2010. Initial recording and sort- ing of the ceramics recovered also indicated differences with the Tong Hills assemblages, as in the much greater use of red slip as a sole decorative technique. Ethnographic data is of little use in interpreting the ceramics from the Tong Hills for pots are now little used outside of ritual contexts by the Talensi, having been replaced by plastic and metal alternatives. This is a pattern observed elsewhere in Africa, as by Ntole (1996: 139) in Mbala contexts in the Congo, and by Hardin (1996: 40) in the Kono area of eastern Sierra Leone. The pots that are used today by the Talensi are produced in the village of Zaare 3 km north of Bolga- tanga and bought from Bolgatanga market 17 km north of the Tong Hills (Eyifa 2007: 85). Some comparative data exists on ceramic production, use, and meaning amongst neighbouring ethno-linguistic groups (e.g. Roy 1987; Smith 1989; Apentiik 1997; Mather 1999) but seeking contemporary ethnographic parallels for the archaeological ceramics from the Tong Hills is also somewhat flawed. The Nyoo ceramics are not Talensi pots - the oral tradition clearly indicates this Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (1), 2011 35</page><page sequence="22">T. Insoll et al. through reference to the incomer Namoos and the au- tochthonous Talis - the Talensi did not exist 1000 years ago, and ethnicity in northern Ghana was and to a certain extent still is fluid (Lentz 2000; Allman &amp; Parker 2005). Priddy (1970: 3) collected useful data on pottery production and trade in northern Ghana in the early 1970s and notes that "the general opinion is that the Tallensi do not make pots". However, she describes pot production by two women in Namoos Talensi com- munities near Tongo at Bagung and Sakpar below the Tong Hills. In both instances the clay is described as coming from the immediate vicinity of the village, but at Sakpar it was mixed with clay from Winkogo 6.5 km west, as otherwise it was too weak for potting. Pot- sherd grog, saringyiek , was added, the pots were coil formed, and decorated with "twisted cord roulette", and "grooves" (incisions) done with the edge of a pebble (Bagung) and the edge of a broken piece of calabash (Sakpar). At Sakpar a red slip was also added to some pots for decoration, made from mixing local brown clay with water (Priddy 1970: 3-4). Eyifa (2007: 85) notes that in the Tong Hills there is an absence of good clay sources. A more recent survey of pots and potting in northern Ghana by Craven (2008) has indicated the further impoverishment of these traditions over the past 40 years. Interpreting the precise function of the ceramics is not possible because of the weakness of ethnographic analogy over such a period of time and a lack of data on Talensi pot use. It can, nonetheless, be suggested that the ceramic functions would have been various based on the range of rim diameters and forms represented and on the different contexts and site types in which they were found. These could have included storage, cooking, serving, eating, drinking, ritual, and medicinal preparation. The presence of only seven recognisable base fragments suggests the vast majority of vessels were round bottomed. Based on similarities between the Tong Hills ves- sel forms and those illustrated in a table of vessel forms collected from northern Ghana by Craven in 1964 and prepared by Priddy (1964) it can be suggested that vessels with a pedestal base, even if the precise form is not known, could have been used for liquids and solids storage, Flared Mouth Bowls for cooking, Hemispheri- cal Bowls for cooking and eating, and Collar Neck jars for storage. Smaller vessels such as the series of complete vessels recovered from NYOO 06 (B) could have been used as personal vessels for liquid consump- tion. The presence of several fragments from smoking, steaming or straining vessels, for example ZAN 08 (A) 4 [3], suggests processing of foodstuffs via proc- esses analogous to those used today, for example, for processing dawadawa pods as previously mentioned, or for smoking meat (see Eyifa 2007: 104). A functional difference can perhaps also be sug- gested between the Nyoo, and the Touwang and Zan- doya assemblages. The significant differences in rim di- ameter size evident at NYOO (A) and (B) and Zandoya and Touwang might substantiate such a difference with the dominance of larger vessel sizes at Nyoo under- standable within a ritual/feasting context. Burnishing and red-slipping are also absent at Nyoo, this might not only be explicable by differences in chronology but could, in part, be due to the different functions of the site, 'ritual' as opposed to domestic (Touwang), and domestic and industrial (Zandoya). Crossland (1989: 58-50 cited in Lawerh 2010: 94-95) describes both burnishing and red slipping as methods for increasing the imperviousness of vessels. This might have been a factor of importance in a domestic and industrial setting where pots were used on an everyday basis in contrast to the pots from Nyoo that seem to have served differ- ent functions perhaps connected in NYOO (A) with feasting, and NYOO (B) with ancestral veneration. Conclusions The analysis described here comprises the first pub- lished ceramics assemblage from the Upper East Re- gion of Ghana. The period represented by the Tong Hills sequence from the second half of the first millen- nium through to the mid-second millennium AD is one of significant importance in West Africa. This begins with the period of nascent state building further to the north in Mali and Mauritania, as with the Kingdom of Ghana (Insoll 2003), and ends with the apogee of the great West African empires (ibid.) and the realignment of trade to the south, to the Akan polity of the forest (McCaskie 2003), and ultimately to the Atlantic coast following European contacts (Stahl 1994; DeCorse 2001). The Tong Hills were always on the historical periphery, perhaps acephalous in political structure, as they were until recently, certainly outside written history and with meagre oral traditions (Allman &amp; Parker 2005). However, the far north of Ghana was not immune from wider events, as the representation of horsemen in the corpus of ceramic figurines at Yikpabongo in Koma Land (e.g. Anquandah 1998: 80-81) might indicate. The region was a focus of slave raiding in the nineteenth century (Garrard 1986; An- quandah 1998: 34-36), and the figurines are perhaps testimony to earlier slave raiding in possibly depicting horsemen from the north. In the nineteenth century slave raiding also directly affected the Tong Hills. The numerous caves and rock shelters recorded that were 36 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 9 (1), 2011</page><page sequence="23">The Iron Age Ceramics from the Tong Hills used as hiding places, as at Buure, on the Hills south of Bonchiig (Insoll et al ., manuscript in preparation [1]) indicate the increased use of the Hills as a refuge in this period according to local narratives. Projecting such interpretations back in time is unwise, though it is probable that the Tong Hills, ris- ing as they do in an otherwise largely undifferentiated plain until the Gambaga Escarpment is reached, were always the focus of ritual attention, settlement, and probably refuge. In order to understand these processes more fully further archaeological research is needed in the far north of Ghana to provide comparative material and to establish a viable regional chronology. Current research at Yikpabongo in the Northern Region ( e.g. Kankpeyeng &amp; Nkumbaan 2009) will be useful in this respect, but undertaking research in the settlements that now form the regional capital of Bolgatanga and its important surrounding potting villages, such as Zaare, should be a priority. This, allied with an expanded programme of pétrographie analysis should enable a better understanding of ceramics trade, sources, and chronology to be reconstructed.
