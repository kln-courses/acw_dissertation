(a study in pure and applied botany)." Memoirs of the Department of Agri- culture in India. Botanical Series, 13, 93 pp. and 8 plates. The memoir contains a full description of this troublesome weed and of several series of experiments conducted with a view to establishing some standard method for its eradication. The plant has several interesting features. Its rate of seed production is fairly high but germination is erratic. It survives chiefly by the production of underground tuber-forming rhizomes, some of which are positively geotropic and may reach a depth of 2-5 feet. Extensive experiments were undertaken to determine the viability of the tubers under varying external conditions. The authors consider that the features in the life cycle which lend themselves to attack are the inability of the plant to flourish in a close community, e.g. in a thick growth of Saun hemp, and the fact that the tubers usually fail to survive after a fortnight at 400 C.-the temperature of the upper soil during the hot season. The description of the work is very full and the experimental data are given in great- perhaps too great-detail. The outlook of the writers on the plant's life is extremely anthropomorphic, thus a deep-seated tuber is described as "concentrating all its powers in making one supreme attempt to get to the surface and, not wasting material on several ascending organs." Economically the work achieves its object, scientifically it opens up a host of semi- physiological problems which bid fair to be of great interest-e.g. the reaction of the external conditions on the plant's physiological processes, causing some rhizomes to be positively geotropic; or again the reason why one bud develops from a deep-seated tuber and several from one which is more superficially situated. It is to be hoped that the authors may find opportunity for the further autecological investigation of the species. S. M. W.</page></plain_text>
