In becoming further and further involved with technology in our daily pursuits, we are flooded with choices for adopting unfamiliar, yet potentially sig- nificant, computerized tools into our dance experience. Exploring the ways in which we interact and invent becomes the material of which dances are made. If there is an offen- sive or daunting aspect of the technological, perhaps it reflects a confrontation with our- selves about what is in our control and what is not. Again, we have circled back to the issue of technique. We all have some experiences of, or ideas about, what a technique class is. But what about a technique class that incorporates an interactive system? Such a system could cap- ture movement by video camera and move- ment processor connected to a music syn- thesizer while displaying images of the danc- ers. Furthermore, what if such a class were synchronously linked with a dance class at a remote location with the same equipment installed? A dance studio that utilizes an ex- panding array of technologies in an effort to deliver dance technique classes may even- tually affect the conceptual framework of the art form. When we teach or learn on the Internet, there is a tremendous potential to grasp knowledge and ideas about the world. Us- ing collaborative online methods, learners re- spond to ideas and communicate in funda- mental ways: sensing and feeling through words, images and actions sent by others, we begin to understand how dance relates to other cultural elements both locally and glo- bally. In my effort to understand the kind of cohesion and transparency necessary to use computer technology more effectively, I fa- vor exploration and discourse. Indeed, my relationship with computer-mediated com- munication is a gateway to creative work, a process countering the notion that technol- ogy is a force for disembodiment.

Expression, Rhythm and Dance: A Response to Gregory Scott In his spirited and densely argued article, "Banes and Carroll on Defining Dance," Gregory Scott presents a very detailed series of criticisms of our earlier piece called "Working and Dancing," which itself was a criticism of Monroe Beardsley's "What is Going on in a Dance?" (1). Scott's reopen- ing of a debate from nearly two decades ago is very welcome, since it allows us to revisit an important discussion concerning the na- ture of dance, a discussion that has been ne- glected in recent years. In "Working and Dancing," we disputed what we took to be Beardsley's theory of dance-that a superfluity of expressiveness, discerned through a contrast with its practi- cal functions, marks a movement as a dance movement. We argued that superfluity of expressiveness, so construed, was neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition of dance. We challenged the claim that it was a neces- sary condition by recalling attention to the genre of task dances, using Yvonne Rainer's Room Service as our leading example. This Dance Research Journal 30/1 (Spring 1998) 15</page><page sequence="2">seemed appropriate, since task dances do not engage in movement qualities that exceed the practical functions of the relevant movement. Moreover, we spent a substantial portion of our article proleptically defending our counterexample to Beardsley's theory by advancing reasons why such cases should not be disallowed on the grounds that Room Ser- vice and similar task dances are not really dance, and, therefore, not genuine coun- terexamples to a theory like Beardsley's. Thus, in a way, our essay also turned into a brief for counting task dances as instances of dance proper. Scott believes that we misinterpreted Beardsley, and that, once Beardsley's theory is correctly formulated, it can be defended against many of our objections. Furthermore, Scott questions our use of Room Service as a legitimate counterexample. Specifically, he maintains that the reasons we provide in be- half of Room Service and similar task dances fail to show that they are dances, and he sug- gests that since they aren't really dances, they cannot be invoked against Beardsley's theory. Indeed, Scott spends almost twice as much space in attempting to show that Room Ser- vice is not a dance, at least given our account of it, than he does in reformulating Beardsley's theory. In what follows we will address the adequacy of Scott's reformula- tion of Beardsley's theory and then go on to examine his discussion of Room Service. Beardsley Scott thinks we misinterpreted Beardsley's theory and that, once it is reformulated, the theory will appear more powerful than we alleged. We disagree with both points. We think that Scott has misinterpreted Beardsley and that, in any case, the theory he offers in its stead is false. First let's look at the issue of misinter- pretation. We think Beardsley maintains that superfluity of expressiveness is the mark of dance. This is what he says in the last line of his article (Beardsley, 643). Scott claims that Beardsley's theory really states that dance is a sequence of motions intended to give pleasure through either rhythm or expressive- ness (Scott, 8). Since Beardsley does not say this anywhere in his essay, this is an inter- pretation on Scott's part. It adds both the in- tention to give pleasure and the feature of rhythm to Beardsley's account. The way that Scott reaches this extrapo- lation is by considering what Beardsley says about St. Augustine's theory of dance. Beardsley discusses St. Augustine twice in his essay, noting that Augustine takes rhythm for the purpose of pleasure as the mark of dance. But, on both occasions, Beardsley re- jects Augustine's theory. Scott, we surmise, thinks that Beardsley did not spurn Augustine's theory entirely, but only thought that it was incomplete. Something needed to be added, namely expressiveness. But Beardsley explicitly blocks this option. He writes: We can state St. Augustine's pro- posal in what seems to be its most plausible form: When a motion, or sequence of motions, does not gen- erate practical actions, and is in- tended to give pleasure through the perception of rhythmic order, it is dance. But even at its best the pro- posal will not serve. Perhaps if we were to add a suitable insistence on expressiveness as another source of pleasure, we would come close to an adequate characterization of dance as art. But I assume that we do not wish to limit our concept of dance in this way. (Beardsley, 642) Thus, Beardsley clearly forgoes the kind of theory that Scott attributes to him. In con- trast, we took Beardsley to be denying Augustine's theory and proposing an alter- native one solely in terms of the superfluity of expressiveness. This is how Beardsley concludes his essay. And this is why we think 16 Dance Research Journal 30/1 (Spring 1998)</page><page sequence="3">that our interpretation portrays Beardsley better than Scott's does. On the other hand, rather than arguing at length about who, if anyone, got Beardsley right, a more interesting question is whether the Scott-Beardsley (or the Scott) theory of dance is a good one. We think that it is not. Scott-or (according to Scott) Scott and Beardsley-hold(s) that dance is a sequence of movements intended to give pleasure through either rhythm or expressiveness. This is certainly inadequate. Much theatrical movement will satisfy this putative defini- tion. Large melodramatic gestures intended to give pleasure through exaggerated expressivity are frequent in the tradition of stage drama, but they are not dance. Cring- ing heroines and sneering, lowering villains are not dancers, but they aspire to and often succeed in delivering pleasure through pro- nounced movement qualities. This, of course, is also a problem for Beardsley's theory, on our formulation. Much theatrical gesticulation satisfies the require- ment of a superfluity of expressiveness with- out counting as dance. Often theatrical ges- ture is large in order to be legible in vast au- ditoriums, but the welcome superfluity of expression it acquires thereby does not make it dance. Beardsley's theory, in either our in- terpretation or Scott's, fails to differentiate dance from a great many instances of theat- rical acting-a major failing, since one sup- poses that a major desideratum of a defini- tion of dance is to discriminate it from its near neighbor, theater. Likewise, theatrical acting can be rhyth- mic for the intended purpose of imparting pleasure. An actor can nod her head, strut or saw the air to the tempo of a poetic mono- logue, but this is not dance. So the theory, whether or not it is Beardsley's, once again is unable to differentiate dance from various types of theatrical acting. Indeed, the theory will not be able to cut the difference between dance and a great deal of preaching where the ministers gesticulate rhythmically in time with their sermons in part to please their con- gregations. The preceding examples show that the Scott-Beardsley theory does not afford jointly sufficient conditions for dance. But since Scott agrees that our earlier article, for dif- ferent reasons, showed that Beardsley did not succeed in providing such conditions, maybe we should not belabor the point (2). Never- theless, we still wonder whether the indi- vidual components of the Scott-Beardsley theory are each supposed to be at least nec- essary conditions for dance. On the Scott-Beardsley theory, it appears to be a necessary condition of dance that the relevant movement be undertaken with the intention to deliver pleasure. If this proposal is meant to encompass nontheatrical danc- ing, this seems unlikely. Neither marathon dancing nor Native American war dances, for example, are intended to promote pleasure. But perhaps we should restrict our atten- tion to theatrical dancing. Yet there will still be a problem here. The notion that theater or art in general is intended to give pleasure or delight-that that is a defining feature of art-is not seriously defended for any other artform. Why should it be a requirement for dance? Indeed, it is doubtful that any artform was ever exclusively devoted to producing pleasure (at least "pleasure" in any ordinary sense of the term). And, anyway, much dance aims at engendering other sorts of experi- ences in audiences. Pearl Primus's Strange Fruit, a dance about a lynching, is intended to produce dis- comfort (as is much modem art). Similarly, Mary Wigman's Totenmal, Charles Weidman's Atavisms, Martha Graham's Night Journey, and Kinder, Kuche, und Kirche by the Nature Friends Dance Group aspire to promote reactions hardly describ- able as pleasureable. And, more recently, Merce Cunningham's Winterbranch, Eleo Pomare's Junkie (part of Blues for the Jungle), Daniel Nagrin'sPeloponnesian War, Pina Bausch's Rite of Spring, and Bill T. Dance Research Journal 30/1 (Spring 1998) 17</page><page sequence="4">Jones's Still/Here are not about engendering pleasure. This is not to deny that all these works have perfectly legitimate artistic, the- atrical, and choreographic purposes. But they are purposes not unambiguously character- ized as imparting pleasure. Like artists in every other arena, choreographers need not aim at promoting pleasure. And, therefore, the intention to provide pleasure is not a nec- essary condition of dance. Scott does not say that rhythm is a neces- sary condition for dance. Rather, he appears to offer us a disjunctive requirement: that dance movement be intended to deliver plea- sure through either rhythm or expression. But not all dance movement is rhythmic; nor is it expressive. Much dance movement, such as contact improvisation, is not necessarily rhythmic outright. Moreover, looking at the tradition, a great deal of dance movement is too flowing or legato to be rhythmic, such as Isadora Duncan's attempts to illustrate melody. Perhaps, in response, Scott will say that, when married to music, dance move- ment, becomes rhythmic. But then the rhy- thm is in the music and not in the movement as his theory requires. As is well known to film directors, the addition of a musical soundtrack will imbue almost any movment with some rhythm. But here the rhythmic properties of the movement are parasitic upon the accompaniment and not intrinsic to the movement. That is, much dance movement is not intrinsically rhythmic, but if it appears so, it does so only by dint of the music. Arguably, Doris Humphrey's Water Study lacks rhythm, as does much of Cunningham's Torse (3). The same may be said of Vaslav Nijinsky's Afternoon of a Faun, to Debussy's fluid music; the chore- ographer, according to Marie Rambert, in- structed his dancers to walk "not strictly to the music, but rather loosely as though walk- ing 'through' the music" (4). Likewise, there is traditional dance movement that may es- chew rhythm in favor of pantomimic and dramatic effects. So rhythm is not a necessary condition of dance movement, even if one only sur- veys the canon of ballet and modern dance. And if one goes further afield and counte- nances examples from postmodern dance, the case is even less convincing. And, of course, dance movement may not be expressive-where expression in- volves the projection of anthropomorphic qualities. It may simply be beautiful or for- mally arresting. So dance movement need not be expressive either. And since traditional dance movement may be beautiful or for- mally arresting without being rhythmic, it is not a necessary condition of dance movement that it be either rhythmic or expressive. Thus, we reject the Scott-Beardsley theory of dance on the grounds that it provides neither nec- essary nor sufficient conditions for dance. Scott challenges one of the counter-ex- amples that we used in "Working and Danc- ing" against the sufficiency of Beardsley's notion of a superfluity of expressiveness (Scott, 10). We imagined a group of sugar- cane cutters in Cuba who raise their machetes rhythmically and higher than necessary, thereby expressing patriotic zeal. Scott thinks that this kind of example will be blocked, once the intention to give pleasure is restored to Beardsley's theory. However, this move is easily outflanked. Just imagine additionally that Fidel Castro is present and that the cane cutters intend to give him pleasure by their demonstration of enthusiasm. This does not make their activity dance. Moreover, cases like this are not necessary to show what is wrong with Beardsley's theory, even as am- plified by Scott, since, as we have shown, the Scott-Beardsley theory is not sufficient for discriminating dance from a great deal of theatrical acting. Scott also tries to save Beardsley's no- tion of superfluity of expression by alleging that it is some kind of special sufficient con- dition-one that only takes hold once some other conditions are met (such as the inten- tion to impart pleasure through movement) 18 Dance Research Journal 30/1 (Spring 1998)</page><page sequence="5">(Scott, 10). But as we have already seen in the preceding paragraph, not only can our objection be adjusted to meet this sugges- tion, but this maneuver will not handle the much deeper objection that much theatrical gesture would count as dance even on this construal. Scott seems of mixed minds about whether we succeeded in showing that su- perfluity of expression is not a sufficient con- dition for dance-sometimes agreeing with us (Scott, 9), but also resisting this conclu- sion (Scott, 10). Nevertheless, he is con- vinced that we have failed to show that su- perfluity of expression is not a necessary condition for dance, arguing that our counterexample, Room Service, is woefully inconclusive, since, he argues, the reasons we give for believing it to be a dance are all mis- guided. Thus, we turn to Scott's discussion of our claims for Room Service. Room Service We think that Room Service and other task dances are instances of dance proper, and that this calls into question Beardsley's assertion that "if, in other words, there is more zest, vigor, fluency, expansiveness, or stateliness than appears necessary for practical purposes, there is an overflow or superfluity of expres- siveness to mark it as belonging to its own domain of dance" (Beardsley, 643). For, if a task dance is performed correctly, it will not display qualities over and above what ap- pears necessary to discharge the practical purposes of the relevant movement. Task dances are predicated upon drawing the audience's attention to the practical intel- ligence of the human body (Carroll and Banes, 645). They achieve this end by defamiliarizing ordinary work movements, like carrying a mattress, in such a way that spectators attend to generally neglected prop- erties of ordinary movement-such as its practical intelligence. This is a matter of mak- ing movement properties, albeit practical ones, perceptible (Carroll and Banes, 645). Another way of putting this is to say that task dances make the movement properties of practical tasks objects of contemplation for their own sake. No other artform-nei- ther theater nor performance art-takes the contemplation of movement for its own sake as one of its central, animating preoccupa- tions. This surely supplies us with a prima facie reason to classify task dances, like Room Service, as dance. One of Scott's worries about our use of Room Service is that he conjectures that, by contextualizing mattress-moving on stage, the work acquires expressive qualities, thereby satisfying Beardsley's definition (Scott, 9). We agree that framing is crucial here. But we see no reason to suppose that framing results in expressiveness, let alone a superfluity thereof. Framing is relevant to giving the mat- tress-moving art status. By defamiliarizing the activity, it becomes an object of close scrutiny for its own sake; various of its typi- cally ignored qualities become objects of appreciative inspection of the sort that some theorists call aesthetic contemplation. More- over, we are disposed to regard this as a rea- son for categorizing Room Service as dance, since dance is the artform that, among other things, is by nature devoted to foregrounding movements and their qualities for their own sake. But this movement is not expressive- it does not project anthropomorphic proper- ties or a surfeit of them. The work, like many other task dances, would be self-defeating if it did. Nor do we see any reason to suppose that it is the act of framing itself that imbues the movement with expressive qualities. The framing is important, but not in the way Scott suggests. It is, as noted, an ingredient in se- curing the art status and the dance status of the piece. But it does not infect the work with expressive properties in the way philosophers and aestheticians, like Beardsley, standardly use that concept. It makes the practical, workerly qualities of the work salient for Dance Research Journal 30/1 (Spring 1998) 19</page><page sequence="6">their own sake. But these properties are not expressive properties; one might even call them nonexpressive properties. Thus, Scott is right in pointing to the importance of fram- ing and recontextualization for dances like Room Service, but he gives absolutely no reason for us to imagine that that importance involves or adds expressivity. Scott's main line of attack with respect to Room Service is to undermine what he alleges to be our four criteria of dance. There is something grossly misleading about Scott's use of the word "criteria." We nowhere talk of proposing criteria in accordance with which Room Service would count as dance. We only propose a number of reasons to be weighed in concert against cashiering Room Service and other task dances from the or- der of Terpsichore. A great deal hinges on the distinction between criteria and reasons. "Criteria" is a piece of philosophical jargon that means "de- fining features." By alleging that we ad- vanced criteria for counting Room Service as dance, Scott implies that we were defend- ing something like our own theoretical defi- nition of dance against Beardsley's. But we had no theory of dance-only reasons to object to Beardsley's theory and reasons to be considered conjunctively for counting Room Service and the like as legitimate counterexamples to Beardsley. One does not need a theory to refute a theory. We gave what we thought were some good reasons to take Room Service seriously. Scott counterattacks by rejecting our "crite- ria" (his word), as if we had a theory. But we advanced no theory, only reasons, the accu- mulation of which collectively, we thought, might incline readers against rejecting ex- amples like Room Service out of hand. We suspect that, as his title indicates, Scott be- lieves that we were defining dance, and he rejects our reasons as if they constituted a definition. But we think that this treats our remarks as being of the wrong logical order which, in turn, leads Scott to reject our rea- sons as if they were intended as invoking defining features of dance. He says of our various points that they are not, on their own, conclusive. And they are not, if one expects criteria, rather than merely good reasons that, when added together, support an all-things- considered judgment. Scott thus easily shows that we don't have a definition of dance in the form of criteria, but we are not convinced that we do not have compelling enough rea- sons to make a prima facie case for task dances like Room Service. But, be that as it may, what are Scott's objections? One reason we give for considering a task dance like Room Service to be dance is that it is generated by the right kind of theory. Arthur Danto has argued that artworks are enfranchised by art theories (5). He has main- tained that theoretical enfranchisement is a necessary condition of art. We do not go so far; nevertheless, we do think that theoreti- cal enfranchisement is a typically recurring feature of modern art. We further argue that works like Room Service were generated by theories of dance that paralleled the enfranchising theories of visual artists like Jasper Johns, Robert Morris, Andy Warhol, and Robert Rauschenberg. Whereas such visual artists were involved in the artistic enfranchisement of ordinary objects, postmodern choreogra- phers like Rainer and Steve Paxton were in- volved in the artistic enfranchisement of or- dinary movement, such as mattress-moving and walking. Moreover, if the work of Johns et al. are considered visual art in large mea- sure due to their relation to the relevant en- franchising theories, then that seems to us to be a good reason to treat the parallel cases of task dances, like Room Service, in the same way. The relevant theories with respect to fine art were publicized in artists' manifestos, in- terviews, and art criticism, all of which made reference to the history of painting and sculp- ture. The relevant theories with respect to 20 Dance Research Journal 30/1 (Spring 1998)</page><page sequence="7">dance appeared in choreographers' manifes- tos, interviews, and dance criticism, and made reference to the history of dance. If the relevant theories with respect to fine art are part of what accounts for the fine art status of works like Brillo Boxes, then parity of reasoning, it seems to us, suggests that we should come to the same (inductive) conclu- sion with respect to Room Service and com- parable task dances. Scott wants to know why these Dantoesque considerations lead us to catego- rize Room Service as dance, rather than merely as art, perhaps as a form of drama (Scott, 12). The reason is simple. The theo- ries have their provenance in the dance world; they refer to dance history, including allu- sions to the dance theories and practices (for example, those of Louis Horst, John Martin, Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, and so on) they hope to supersede; and, finally, they are preoccupied with foregrounding ordinary movement where movement is prima facie in the domain of the art of dance specifically, not art in general or drama or even perfor- mance art. Scott points out that this doesn't necessarily show that Room Service is dance. That might be an objection logically if we were arguing that theoretical enfranchise- ment was a criterion of dance-a defining feature-but we were not. On the other hand, theoretical enfran- chisement is a typically recurring, integral feature of avant-garde artforms other than dance, so it seems reasonable to believe that it is relevant in the assessment of the status of avant-garde dance candidates. Scott points out that many do not accept the relevant en- franchising theories and that the theories may be flawed in several respects. However, the point is that these dances correlate with recognizable danceworld theories, and not that everyone accepts them or that they are perfectly acceptable. After all, it is not the case that everyone accepts the parallel artworld theories, but their relation to theo- ries enfranchises them nonetheless. A second reason we give on behalf of Room Service and comparable task dances is that they are linked genetically to the evolv- ing history of dance. Here, we had in mind that task dances are the result of reactions against historical dance practices and their subtending theories. Rainer was arguing against the tendency to, in her view, cloak movement in modern dance metaphor and expressivity. Thus, she was working in the discursive framework of dance history, con- cerned with the naturally occurring choreo- graphic question of how to render movement. That was Rainer's real genesis-a dance- world genesis, concerned with danceworld positions about the issue of the appropriate choreographic stance toward movement. Room Service originated in a danceworld debate concerned with a danceworld issue, which it addressed by means of movement. What else would it be but dance? Scott suggests that it might be perfor- mance art or that it might be a kinesiological study. There are problems with both of these options. First, let's consider the possibility that Room Service is performance art (a term, by the way, which only became common in the seventies). Scott points to the history of Futurist and Bauhaus performance and indi- cates that Room Service might belong to that tradition rather than to dance. This raises a number of issues. To begin with, there is a logical problem with Scott's argument. Since performance art is often taken by people like RoseLee Goldberg (whom Scott cites with approval) to include dance, it does not fol- low from the assertion that Room Service is performance art that it is not dance. It is a non sequitur to suppose it does. Addition- ally, performance art is not generically con- cerned with movement and its qualities. Per- haps only the part of performance art that already overlaps with dance is so centrally concerned. Moreover, Rainer's work did not as a matter of historical fact originate in Futurist or Bauhaus experimentation, nor was it in- Dance Research Journal 30/1 (Spring 1998) 21</page><page sequence="8">spired by them. Rather, it emerged as a reac- tion to the danceworld theories and practices of people like Graham and Humphrey. That Scott thinks that he can cook up a tradition for Rainer indicates that he is thinking in terms of mere resemblances a la Morris Weitz and not real genetic linkages-real histori- cal influences and reactions. Rainer is not descended from the Futurists, but from mod- ern dance, to which she stands as Electra (6). For similar reasons, Scott's suggestion that Room Service and other task dances are kinesological studies misses its mark. Again, the first reason is logical. The line between kinesological studies and dance is not so clear. Delsarte deportment exercises, German physical culture drills, and Anna Halprin's modifications of Margaret H'Doubler's ki- nesiological investigations have all been prof- fered as dance in the twentieth century, while some early ballet may be little more than deportment exercises for French noblemen. That is, some so-called kinesiological stud- ies may be a subcategory of dance. Thus, arguing that Room Service and other task dances are kinsiological studies would not entail that they are not dance. And, in any case, Rainer herself was not working in the tradition of kinesiology, but in the tradition of dance. Scott cannot place her in any tradition he wants on the basis of some glancing perceptual analogies with the work of Muybridge. What tradition Rainer belongs in is a matter of historical fact-a matter of what conceptual frameworks she accessed, what debates she actually entered, her in- tended audiences, her actual audiences (she was reviewed in dance columns, albeit some- times unfavorably, but not by science maga- zines), and so on. And in this respect, all the evidence points toward dance proper, rather than kinesiology, as Rainer's actual tradition. Scott also proposes that Room Service and similar task dances may not be dance, but cultural diatribe or cultural criticism or the progeny thereof (Scott, 15). Anything but dance! But why would showing that Room Service was also any of these preclude its being dance? Scott calls our third "criterion" for dance historical narrative. Actually, this is only an explication of the previous notion of genetic linkages, insofar as genetic linkages-such as lines of influence-are represented by his- torical narratives. We regard it as a good reason to take Room Service as dance that it can be situ- ated as an intelligible episode in the narra- tive of twentieth-century dance. Scott alleges that this is circular, but he overlooks the fact that circularity is a flaw in definitions, and narratives are not definitions (7). Many his- torical entities, like nations and even biologi- cal species, are not identified by means of definitions, but by histories, histories that trace lineages of descent from earlier ac- knowledged examples of a class to new can- didates. Since we work from acknowledged forebears in our narratives, the issue of cir- cularity does not arise. Additionally, we believe that historical narratives supply us with our best means for classifying avant-garde art and dance cor- rectly. Thus, if we are able to connect Room Service to the history of dance, we have good reason to classify it as dance. Scott says that there are no ways to establish that such nar- ratives are satisfactory (Scott, 16). But that simply cannot be right. Genuine historical narratives must be true to the historical record. Surely we can determine whether a putative historical narrative accords with the known facts. Also, Scott pays scant attention to what we believe comprises an adequate historical narrative of the sort we have in mind (8). On our view, an adequate historical narrative of this sort tracks the artist's actual conception of the choice situation in which she finds her- self-her assessment of the situation, her conception of what needs to be done, her view of the options available for doing it, and so on (9). Moreover, considerations like these lead 22 Dance Research Journal 30/1 (Spring 1998)</page><page sequence="9">us to deny that an adequate historical narra- tive of what Rainer was actually doing can connect Room Service to the tradition of drama, performance art, or Muybridgean ki- nesiological studies. We would not deny that Rainer was influenced by Duchamp, but she applied Duchamp's insights to the world of movement, the domain of dance. No other historical account of what she was doing, we believe, explains all the facts as well as the one that connects her with the history of dance (10). Lastly, Scott cites our observation that another reason for taking Room Service as a dance is that it emblematizes the spirit of its times, something that people always say about central cases in the dance canon. Scott says that this is "not enough" (Scott, 18). And, of course, he's right, especially if he understands emblematization to be a crite- rion of dance. It is far too broad for that. But we don't say it is a criterion, but only one more reason that, when added to all the rest adduced so far, provides evidence in favor of counting Room Service as dance. Moreover, there are other reasons for counting Room Service as dance besides the ones discussed so far. These include the fol- lowing: after more than thirty-five years, task dances are still performed; they are taught in choreography classes; they have influenced the course of postmodern dance, giving rise to movements such as contact improvisation and choreographers like Johanna Boyce and Elizabeth Streb; they are discussed by dance critics and have a place in dance history books, dictionaries, and encyclopedias; they are analyzed at dance conferences; they have been funded by agencies under the advice of expert dance panels; they are recon- structed at dance festivals; they figure recur- rently in sophisticated debates about the con- tested boundaries of dance. Thus, they not only emerged from dance history, but they have become part of dance history, part of the legacy of late twentieth-century dance to the future. They are standing the test of time, at least in terms of respectable danceworld opinion, by which we mean not simply a handful of elite critics, but inter- ested young dancers, dance teachers, cura- tors, festival organizers, and curious, often appreciative, audiences. Unlike Scott, we take danceworld prac- titioners to be reliable indicators of what falls into the scope of dance. We are less inter- ested in legislating what should count as dance according to a theory, but regard our task as that of tracking what informed prac- titioners do. From this perspective, we think that we have good reasons to suppose that Room Service and comparable task perfor- mances are examples of dance. On the other hand, we fear that Scott's objections to these cases, which are sometimes based on their lack of rhythm and expression (Scott, 12), might simply be a matter of begging the question in favor of his own (or maybe Beardsley's) theory of dance (11).

However, it should be pointed out that one way of reading the concluding sentence of Beardsley's essay is to understand it as providing only a sufficient condition for dance. That is, once pared down, the sentence appears to say "If x possesses a superfluity of expressiveness, then x is a dance movement." But if Beardsley is really only advancing a sufficient condition for dance, and Scott thinks that we've blocked that, then, as they say, the jig is up (perhaps before it begins). 3. Of course, whether one thinks that these two dances substitute flow or pictorialism for rhythm depends on how one defines rhythm in dance, which so far Scott has not indicated. Moreover, if Scott does define rhythm, he must be careful not to define it too broadly, lest all movement fall into the category of dance. 4. Marie Rambert, Quicksilver (London: Macmillan, 1972), 62. 5. Arthur Danto, The Transfiguration of the Commonplace (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1981). 6. Similarly, in a later part of the article, Scott tries to imagine an artistic tradition for Van Gogh's mutilation of his own ear. But unless Van Gogh was working within the conceptual frameworks of these traditions in such a way that they had actual, material influence on what he did, we would not be willing to grant that he was working in the relevant traditions. 7. This is explained at greater length in Noel Carroll, "Historical Narratives and the Philosophy of Art," Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 51/3 (1993): 313-326. 8. For detailed exposition of our view of this kind of narrative, see: Noel Carroll, "Historical Narratives and the Philosophy of Art," and Noel Carroll, "Identifying Art," in Institutions of Art, ed. Robert Yanal (University Park, PA: Penn State University Press, 1993), 3-38. 9. Moreover, this is not simply a matter of taking Rainer's pronouncements about what she's done at face value. That Rainer said so would not be enough to count Room Service as dance. Rather, we would want to ask whether what she said struck us as reasonable within the artworld and danceworld contexts in which she operated, given her beliefs and motives, supposing them to be informed and situationally intelligible. The choreographer cannot make her work dance by fiat. On the other hand, we need not ignore what the choreographer says, since it may give us insight into her beliefs, desires, and intentions where those factors, among others, are relevant to determining which action the agent performed. That is, what Rainer thought she was doing, rather than what she might merely say she was doing, is what is important, where her thinking can also be shown to be embedded, well-motivated, and shaped by an intelligible danceworld problematic. 10. On page 17, Scott indicates that he is skeptical about our faith in narration as crucial to classification. He signals a preference for definitions in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. He claims that the necessary-and-sufficient-condition approach is the tested one, while the narrational approach is not. Perhaps a few comments are worth making here. First, though we have no objection to the use of this sort of analysis in some cases, it is not clear that it is the only option in all cases. For example, consider the causal theory of meaning in philosophy and prototype theory in psychology. Moreover, for some purposes, the method is not so much tested as contested. In biology, for instance, cladistic speciation is determined by narratives of descent, not by necessary and sufficient conditions. Similarly, on our view, narration may be a superior method for classifying dance than definitions employing necessary and sufficient conditions which, when stated, as in the Scott-Beardsley theory, in terms of perceptual properties like expression and rhythm, may close the concept in a way that is ultimately question-begging. 11.
