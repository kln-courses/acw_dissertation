Young children also love to explore the motion of objects - they watch tossed balls, observe objects rolling down ramps, and are mesmerized by spinning tops. Yet it can be challenging to integrate these two loves, stories and exploring motion, in one lesson. Furthermore, while children are fascinated with motion, describing motion and change in position as a result of motion involves using challenging scientific practices. In this article, we describe a learning experience that follows an alternate approach to integrating science and liter- acy. The learning experience was designed for kinder- garten through second-grade students participating in an enrichment program conducted by teacher educa- tion students. Use Your Imagination Integrating science and literacy often leads teachers to focus on expository or procedural texts. Since science knowledge is often communicated through exposi- tory text, it is natural and reasonable integrate these texts into science lessons. Learning to read expository texts, which have been shown to be infrequently used in elementary classrooms (Duke 2000), is important in science learning. However, because narratives are fa- miliar and commonly used in elementary classrooms, we wondered whether they might be useful to children when learning science concepts. For example, a prac- tice called embodied imagining has been employed to help older children learn to describe phenomena (War- ren, et al. 2001). Embodied imagining is an approach that encourages children to imagine how phenomena occur and embody - act out - those phenomena. Chil- dren might imagine and even experience being on a ramp, then imagine being an object on that ramp, ex- perience the pull of gravity causing them to increase in speed as they run down the ramp, and finally, imagine being an object under similar forces. Through this ac- tivity, learners identify and imagine the elements or ac- tors, causal factors, sequences of events, and outcomes in situations. We were inspired by this idea, recogniz- ing that narratives include similar features, and sought to apply the concept to another type of learning expe- rience. One reason for this is that narratives are dif- ferent and encourage different kinds of thinking about relationships between causal factors and sequences of events. Within the storyline of a narrative, events hap- pen and often the causes of those events are included or implied. For example, in the classic version of The Three Little Pigs, the first pig builds a house of straw. A reader must infer that such a structure is relative- 46 Science and Children</page><page sequence="2">Summary of activities in 5E lesson.

When the wolf blows on the house, there is enough force to knock the house down. Throughout a narrative, a reader must use knowledge, as well as imagine fictional contexts, to make inferences about the causes and effects of events in the narrative. Giv- en this thinking about imagining and narratives, we thought using a narrative might encourage children to use their imaginations in learning to describe motion. Similarly, because narratives involve sequences of events, we speculated that a narrative might be effec- tive in challenging children to pay attention to change in position of objects. The National Science Education Standards (NRC 1996) recommends that children in kindergarten to grade 4 learn to describe the motion of an object. Concerning the disciplinary core idea of mo- tion and stability: forces and interactions, A Framework for K-12 Science Education suggests that by the end of grade 2, students should understand that "pushing or pulling on an object can change the speed or direction of its motion and can start or stop it" (NRC 2011). There are two important dimensions in describing motion: objects change relative position and changes in position occur during a period of time. Choosing the Text In selecting a book that matched well with some of the challenges children face in describing motion in terms of change in position over time, we needed a clear and simple story involving a sequence of events that por- trays motion. We discovered the book Changes , Chang- es by Pat Hutchins (1987), a fantastical, wordless pic- ture book in which toys become animated and go on a short adventure. The images on each page undergo sequential changes as blocks, pattern blocks, and other October 2012 47</page><page sequence="3">¡2" g!

Using narratives in science learning does require us to think carefully about the content of the story and whether the story presents inaccurate science content or could potentially cause children to create incorrect ideas. In this example, the anthropomorphism of toys could contribute to children anthropomorphizing inanimate objects. Similarly, we know of many picture books that include scientific errors. Yet, these potential pitfalls are also opportunities for science learning. Teachers can fa- cilitate discussions with students to identify and clarify misunderstandings. Furthermore, the books present opportunities for children to apply science knowledge to demonstrate understandings. Teaching the Lesson We conducted this lesson according to the 5 E instruc- tional model. See Table 1 (p. 47) for an overview. For the Engage portion of the lesson, the teacher began with a prereading discussion. She asked students about the title and cover of the book to encourage the students to predict what the book might be about. She also asked students to describe the cover illustration. Once the stu- dents were engaged through discussing predictions, the teacher moved on to explore the first couple of pages of the story. The teacher encouraged students' explorations by asking questions like, "What is different?" and "How is it different?" Initially children struggled to describe specific changes in each new image; yet it seemed that they easily visualized the overall changes in the images, seeing that on each page a new illustration was formed. Students did focus on changes in position of individual objects to create new illustrations. For example, the children could describe that in the new image, the ve- hicle now "had cannons." But the children struggled to clearly describe a change in relative position of a block or toy that occurred to make the new image. The children's focus on global differences seems similar to describing motion as fast or slow. A description that focuses on categorical and global aspects of motion is quite different than a description that attends to details and continuous, changing aspects of motion. Recognizing that students were not using motion verbs such as shift, flip, slide , or rotate to describe changes, the teacher explained these terms and how students could use these verbs to help describe motion. The teacher modeled her observations of changes in the illustrations, using the motion verbs and then asked questions to scaffold students' descriptions of motions. She focused students' attention by highlighting and ad- dressing individual block changes instead of the change in the entire picture. For example, the teacher pointed out, discussed, and defined how different blocks were ar- ranged to make an image. Then she was able to emphasize the changes in position of specific blocks from picture to picture, the relative position, and how the changes made new images. Based on this example, she had the children collectively generate a definition of change of position. The teacher and students agreed that change of position needed to describe how an object moved as compared with other objects. Then children were asked to describe changes in position of individual blocks from page to page. The children caught onto the idea quickly and began using motion verbs such as shift, flip, and rotate to describe change of position of individual blocks. In order to challenge students to elaborate on their new ideas about describing change in position and also evaluate how well children had learned to describe changes in position, the final activity required children to use pattern blocks to create and transform images. After discussing appropriate uses of the pattern blocks, children created images with pattern blocks and drew pictures on a worksheet to replicate the images. Next, each child transformed the original image into a new image by moving the pattern blocks. Each child wrote descriptions of changes in position of individual blocks in his or her image using motion verbs to create a new image (also drawn). Finally, each child shared his or her initial image with a partner. Then the child attempted to describe to his or her partner how to transform the original image using vocal commands that specifically described changes in position, such as "I have an orange square that slides two lengths to the right" or "I have a green triangle on top of a red square. Then, the green triangle rotates to the side of the red square." The activity required children to ap- ply their new motion vocabulary to describe changes to a partner. Children's written work was collected and as- sessed to determine whether each child could accurately use terms like flip, slide , or rotate to describe changes in position. 48 Science and Children</page><page sequence="4">Storybook Science The Moral of the Story Is... We believe this lesson highlights a number of potential benefits from expanding our notions of science and lit- eracy integration. First, a narrative text helped provoke children to think about science disciplinary core ideas. Second, the nature of the book (being a wordless picture book) invited discussion. Additionally, since there were no words, the teacher and students needed to discuss the images and changes in the images in order to infer a story. Such language-rich discussions can be structured to use scientific vocabulary. The wordless nature of this book is beneficial to developing multiple science skills, including making inferences and using observations and evidence to make claims. While this article focuses on use of picture books with young children, it is possible to imagine modifying this approach for teaching older students. For example, teachers might use books by authors like David Weisner or Chris Van Allsburg (see NSTA Connection for titles by these authors) with older children to engage their imaginations and challenge them to think about science concepts. Alternatively, we can imagine challenging older students to apply science knowledge to critically examine other texts like chapter books or even genres like graphic novels. The point is that the imaginative nature of narratives can engage children to connect imaginative thinking with learning science concepts. To use this approach requires engaging with texts from the perspective that texts can do more than deliver content or stories. Learning experiences can use texts as objects to be examined and questioned, using the same strategies used to ask questions of the natural world. This reflects ideas shared by Froschauer (2011) who suggests that teachers should develop clear purposes for text use in science learning. She challenges us to consider that the genre of the text is not the issue, rather the issue is thinking about how a text might support the science learning that we want for children. Ultimately, we agree and believe that learning science concepts, using stories as tools in learning, and activating imagi- nations can be effectively integrated to engage children in scientific explorations that develop understandings of the natural world. ■ Mark Enfield (menfield@elon. edu) is an assistant pro- fessor at Elon University in Elon , North Carolina .
