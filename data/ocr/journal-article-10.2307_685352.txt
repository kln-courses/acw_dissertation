<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS EVOLUTIONARY MAN i The Moribund Supernatural IN the medieval world (and even more so, in the Dark Ages) it was presumed that anything could happen 1 at any time according to the arbitrary fiat of god or demon. For even physical phenomena, it was thought, whether they normally behaved according to 'laws' or not were not bound by any science but were at the mercy of spirits, or could at least be dominated by the arbitrary will of God. But during the past 300 years and more, with the rise and development of the physical sciences, men have increasingly come to the conclusion that events in the physical world occur according to inviolable and discoverable laws. Whatever be the power of God or Devil in whatever their sphere of influence, we have become increasingly sure that they do not in fact for- tuitously 'break in' on physical nature causing unpredictable things to happen. As Spinoza was at pains to show 'if a stone falls from a roof on the head of a passer-by and kills him ', this is due to a train of perfectly understandable natural causes. To say, as used to be said, that the tragedy was the will of God was idiotic. For 'the will of God' was only 'the asylum of ignorance '.2 Nevertheless it was assumed, until quite recently, that this science- centred pattern of human thinking about the physical world was an order of things created and sustained by an external supernatural authority. The order of nature was under Divine auspices. God could fortuitously 'inter- fere' if He wished. If and when He did we had miracle. It was also assumed by most Western people until quite recently (as it is still assumed by whatever number of Orthodox Believers still remain) that in addition to God potentially able to tamper with the physical universe there is that same God who not only can, but does, continually interfere in a spiritual order of things. Thus if a man is cured of some disease after his having prayed God for recovery (and especially in a case where the medical practitioners have 1 Of course as Lecky points out phenomena were not thought of as being all equally likely to exhibit unaccustomed and unexpected behaviour. Some are more unpredict- able than others and ' appear capricious ', and it is these that ' are associated especially with divine intervention'. Prominent examples he gives are comets, meteors, and (in general) atmospheric phenomena.

But more and more of late, educated thinking men in a climate of opinion increasingly scientific and encouraged by the ever growing in- dustrialisation and urbanisation of their mental ' atmosphere' have become sceptical. Sceptical as to whether, in fact, there is any supernatural indepen- dent order of things over and above and beyond our human experience. There are, perhaps, four main reasons for this increasing scepticism: (I) As the sciences gradually increase in number as well as scope, it is realised that more and more domains of human experience, once conceived of as not-to-be-explained by any science, are yielding their secrets to science. This naturally leads men to the thought that possibly all' mysterious' pheno- mena are only mysterious because of human ignorance. So it seems possible, or even probable, that when we have come to explore and explain the Supernatural more fully, through the evolution of scientific method, it will be discovered to be natural. (2) (closely linked to (I)). If there were a supernatural world existing outside and independently of the natural, it would indicate a dualistic uni- verse. And this is repugnant to human reason which in the last resort inherently demands a monistic universe. It makes more sense.1 (3) Modern astronomy is making it increasingly evident that the tradi- tional source of the Supernatural in some place 'beyond the stars' becomes less and less likely. And although one can plausibly make out a case for God and Heaven being 'located' within human personality, they appear less awesome than the external anthropomorphic Abode from whence man traditionally derived his being. In a word, astrophysics says to man today: 'If you are to use the terms God and Heaven with any correct (sensible) meaning, you must necessarily be referring to the highest (so far) human experience and human values.' (4) The behaviour of the traditional Supernatural Deity is so erratic, inconsistent, and unjust that it seems unlikely that He has any existence outside the imaginations of individuals. His behaviour? Take, for in- stance, His reaction to humanity's petitionary prayers. History seems to indicate clearly that even if petitionary prayers were ever ' answered ' (and that the particular events were not just due to natural causation), they were answered so capriciously, and so independently of the moral worth of the petitioners, that all unprejudiced rational men are bound to conclude that the supposed Deity is without conscience as well as without heart. 1 It seems obvious that Western philosophy would have tended, all through its 2,6o00 years history, to be always monistic (though doubtless under varied forms) had it not been for the mental and moral inhibitions of the philosophers. For nearly all of them were prejudiced by their religious education and so were pre-determined to think dualistic- ally. 42</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS Or take human suffering. This He permits without apparently any consistent and just plan. Briefly, the ' good' may die in agony; the ' evil' may live in long enjoyment. In earlier days men accepted these facts, as well as the God who supported them, because theologians and their satellites (all of whom were very wise men) assured the less wise that these things were true and even just. Fear paralysed the natural reasoning power of those unversed in the Queen 1 of the Sciences. But as men have become more mentally and morally emanci- pated through the spread of education this fear has increasingly diminished, and as it has diminished there has developed a growing sense in the individual of a freedom and a right to think for himself. In this process he becomes aware 2 that his moral consciousness is in revolt not only against the naivet6 of traditional religious dogmas and doctrines but also against their not- sufficiently-edifying tone.3 It thus seems to him more healthy, as well as more reasonable, to vene- rate the more noble of the moral and spiritual elements that he finds within himself rather than continue to pay homage to the gratuitous, and often capricious, Demiurge of the theologians. For all these reasons then civilised man has become more and more sceptical about the value as well as the truth of traditional religion. And it is against the foregoing background that one can perhaps best try to review and assess The Humanist Frame.4 2 Humanist themes The book is a symposium of twenty-six essays by some twenty-seven contributors. The basic thought which holds the diversity of the chapters together is this: ' Man's destiny is to be the sole agent for the future evolu- tion of this planet' (p. 17). And this he must achieve ' unaided by outside help. In the evolutionary pattern of thought there is no longer either need or room for the supernatural' (p. 18). Each chapter deals with some particular aspect of this general theme. For example, man (as individual and as society) is examined in relation to each of the following: medicine, the sciences (in general, and in particular), politics, economics, education, international integration, morality, the fine arts, religion, world resources and population, scientifically controlled breeding, and even Outer Space. 1 i.e. Theology 2 This is a rationalisation. It should be conceded, without any impairing of the argument above, that few even among the emancipated think thus consciously and ex- plicitly. More often the revolt is instinctive and subconscious. 3 Cf. T. A. Sinclair in A History of Classical Greek Literature, London, 1934, p. 282, 'Human beings are often nobler than the gods they worship '. 4 The Humanist Frame, edited by Julian Huxley, Allen and Unwin, London, I96I, pp. 432, 37s. 6d. 43</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS And since all the contributors to this symposium are fully conscious of the fact that they see man and all his activities (science, morality, education, etc.) as essentially evolutionary, they properly have all the time an eye on human history-past and present, but especially on the expected shape and complexion of the future history that is in process of being evolved. For the avowed aim of these Humanists is to try to give some indication of the way in which humanity may improve itself in the future through conscious and deliberate planning. At the same time the planning must be realistic, i.e. what man can become must be based on a full realisation of his nature, past as well as present. For reasons that will be manifest later 1 in this review, no attempt will be made to give any complete summary of the contents of this book. We merely outline what seem to be the leading ideas that keep cropping up; and for this present review a 'leading idea' will mean not only one which would seem to have practical relevance to evolving man, but also one that is scientific, or is at least in large measure conducive to scientific treatment. The Preface and the opening chapter are each from the pen of Sir Julian himself. The gist of the book (as he says in his Preface) is easy to summarise. Thus: Evolution has not been one continuous homogeneous process. It has come about in distinct phases--(i) inorganic, (2) biological, (3) psycho- social. Mankind is now entering (4) self-consciously purposive evolution; in this phase man plans his own destiny, so we have the phase of Humanism. Then follows the first chapter which is itself entitled 'The Humanist Frame', and which is written with a high degree of lucidity and which serves as an excellent introduction to the varying themes of the contributors who follow-in fact many of their ideas are' touched on' by Sir Julian in anticipation. The Humanism that is here being sponsored is, he insists (p. 14) 'neces- sarily unitary instead of dualistic, affirming the unity of mind and body; universal instead of particularist, affirming the continuity of man with the rest of life . . . naturalistic instead of supernaturalist, affirming the unity of the spiritual and the material; and global instead of divisive, affirming the unity of all mankind.' And again, his humanism will have nothing to do with absolutes. Truth, morality . . . and authority are all relative. This last seems obvious since (as he goes on to say), 'This new vision is inevitably an evolutionary one.' And it becomes abundantly clear in the course of the book that evolution is total; everything evolves. So of course there can be no absolutes. But Sir Julian stresses the importance of the fact that man's evolution from the time of his emergence 'as truly man' (p. 16) has no longer been biological but has been, first, psychosocial. This psychosocial phase results from the birth of conceptual thought and language which (both individually 1 See Section 3, P. 49 44</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS and socially) has brought about continual improvement through the elaboration and transmission of ideas. This phase is a great advance in man's develop- ment. But it has its limitations in that these ideas have often been gratuitous dogmas and prejudices, antithetic to change and progress. But now (stemming from Darwin) mankind is entering a new phase, that of self-consciously purposive evolution. The movement of mankind from the biological, through the stages of the psychosocial, and leading into the self-consciously purposive is summed up: 'There is thus a succession of successful idea-systems instead of a succession ofsuc- cessful bodily organisations. Each new successful idea-system spreads and dom- inates some important sector of the world, until it is superseded by a rival system, or itself gives birth to its successor by a breakthrough to a new organised system of thought and belief. We need only think of the magic pattern of tribal thought, the god-centred medieval pattern organised round the concept of divine auth- ority and revelation, and the rise in the last three centuries of the science-centred pattern, organised round the concept of human progress, but progress somehow under the control of supernatural authority. In 1859 Darwin opened the door to a new pattern of ideological organisation-the evolution-centred organisation of thought and belief.' 1 This 'evolution-centred organisation of thought and belief' has had tremendous consequences, which are clearly grasped by the contributors generally (following Sir Julian's lead). They can be expressed in this way: (I) Man has been 'ousted from his self-imagined centrality in the universe' (p. 18) to find himself in an infinitely insignificant location in a million galaxies. (2) On the other hand, through the concept of evolution, man is infinitely significant. He has 'mind' and 'the evolution of mind . . . is an extremely rare event in the vast meaninglessness of the . . . universe.' Sir Julian implies (and rightly) that, from this point of view, man can now be seen as a more important and prouder being than he always appeared in the light of theism. For there he was a dependent wretch who owed his being and his fortune to the caprice of an anthropomorphic Deity. Here, because of the emergence of mind, he is a veritable Prometheus. He is not one who has 'fallen from grace' (i.e. from a higher state); on the contrary he has soared upwards out of the primeval ooze to become (at his best) god- like. That is why 'Man's destiny is to be the sole agent for the future evolution of this planet.' We here arrive at a profoundly significant consideration which under- lies the whole of The Humanist Frame and, when properly understood, explains the driving force that sustains and animates and even gives an essential kind of unity to the diversity of chapters. (It also greatly illum- inates point (2) made above.) 1 The Humanist Frame, pp. i6, 17 45</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS It is this. In 1859 Darwin appeared (to those who bothered to think about him at all) to be contending by his theory of evolution that man was not specially created at a specific moment in time, but that he in fact gradu- ally evolved over a vast period from more primitive forms of animal life. It appeared that, revolutionary as the theory seemed, the matter simply concerned biology and could be contained therein. Other sciences and departments of knowledge could apparently 'carry on' pretty well as before-proclaiming their Absolutes, their static facts, their unchanging data. Thus theologians, although not too happy (as the controversies showed) about the scientific attack on man's sacrosanct origins, and not always sure as to how they ought to react to Genesis I, at least believed almost to a man that the fundamentals of theology were quite safe and untouched by the Darwinian heresy. Even if evolution were true, God (the Great Funda- mental) was still ' there'. Even evolution did not create itself. It needed God to do that. God (the Permanent) started it off as part of his plan. But now, in fact, the limiting of the concept of evolution to biology has gone except in the case of' those who deliberately shut . . . their eyes (p. 17)'. Or, let us say, the concept has expanded right out beyond the bounds of biology until now (as the Humanists clearly recognise) it is seen to apply right through the universe in every department and aspect. As Sir Julian has written elsewhere 1: ' Since Darwin, every field of study, from astronomy to human history, from geology to linguistics, must be viewed sub specie evolutiones [evolutionis?], as a process.' That is to say change and development are the very heart of the being of the whole universe. The growth of man's knowledge in every department depends upon our ability to discard, at every stage, more naive concepts for those that are more sophisticated. Theology will doubtless always have some vital meaning for humanity. But 'unlike most theologies it (that implied in Humanism) accepts the inevitability and indeed the desirability of change, and advances by welcoming new discovery even when it conflicts with old ways of think- ing' (p. 22). Therefore, even when it comes to the concept of God, the Humanist realises that as man evolves he necessarily posits a changing God who in His development is identical with the highest that man is and knows. Even Deity therefore is not Absolute but Relative. And one must not shrink from saying that God (who is changing and not Permanent) is dependent upon the evolution of man's consciousness for the further development of his being. Thus The Humanist Frame can be seen to be inspired and sus- tained by the realisation of the inherent necessity for man to continue to formulate successively ever fresh visions of the universe-comprehending all departments of the universe, life, and mind in the light of change. Aristotle and the Christians gave a false view of man and his thinking because for 1 Sunday Times, 14 July 1957 46</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS them all the fundamentals were 'fixed '. For the Humanists, because of the fundamental concept of change, man is indeed Prometheus. All this is vital to the book under review and permeates it. Man's future programme. What are to be the present aims of this changing man in the light of his ' new evolutionary vision' ? How to build a better world ? (I) Man's thinking must be global. We must transcend nationalism and pool our resources. Otherwise we shall fail to achieve the highest that humanity is capable of; for energies will be dissipated in ideological conflict. (2) And yet this must not be allowed to mean the triumph of Ad-mass. We must be concerned for the individual. 'Though our new idea-pattern must be unitary, it need not and should not be cramping, or impose a drab or boring cultural uniformity. . ... Cultural variety . . . is the spice of life ' (p. 22). And so it is essential to preserve it. Particularly in education, we must encourage individual variety and not try to educate children as a homogeneous mass. They are not equal in their gifts and potentialities. The motto must be 'free but unequal' (p. 24). (3) We must face the population-explosion and deal with it drastically. Too many people are being born and survive, and the rate of increase is out of all proportion to the world's resources. But we need not only universal birth-control, but also, by the application of science, to breed only the best types. In other words, world population must be reduced in quantity and increased in quality. (4) The Western economic system is all wrong and needs a 'reversal of ideas' (p. 24). It is based on the idea that everybody must be continually persuaded to believe that he needs more and more of purchasable products. This is leading to a gross over-exploitation of resources that ought to be preserved. We need a new economic system aimed at satisfying 'real human needs, spiritual and mental as well as material . . .' (p. 25). (5) One of the main tasks of man in the coming era must be the explora- tion of the human mind, just as the exploration of the world's surface was a major preoccupation a few centuries ago. For man is 'still strangely ignorant and even superstitious' about the human mind (p. 25). (6) Finally the evolutionary vision is leading us, however incompletely and tentatively, to the lineaments of a new religion. 'Instead of worship- ping supernatural rulers, it will sanctify the higher manifestations of human nature. . . .' And '. . . Evolutionary truth frees us from subservient fear of the unknown and supernatural . . .' (p. 26). Sir Julian then proceeds to outline what he conceives to be' the Humanist view of the three great activities of man . . .: art, science, and religion' (p. 27). (I) Art. Art is of fundamental importance and he uses the term broadly 'to cover all organised expression of experience in significant and 47</page><page sequence="8">REVIEWS aesthetically effective form'. Art is not a thing but a 'type of human activity and'its products' (p. 27). It is, in a sense, a way of' escape '-but if we say this, it is not an escape ' downwards ' (as if through drink or drugs) but upwards to 'new levels of being, where we make contact with something more en- during . . . and . . . higher than is to be found in the world of material needs and everyday routine' (p. 29). (2) Science. He starts off with an apt warning. 'We must beware of the misuse of words like science and scientific, especially by those who want to cash in on the prestige of science to advance their own views or interests. Thus theology once arrogated to itself the title of Queen of the Sciences, and still claims rather plaintively 1 to be a science-a claim which it could only justify by adopting scientific method.' Science is tending more and more to present us with a monistic universe. The separate sciences grow and frequently fuse with one another to form a more comprehensive pattern. Each science, or patch of organised know- ledge, is as it were an island in a sea of ignorance. But as the whole of human experience becomes gradually organised there will be no more isolated islands for they will continue to join up until at last the sea of ignorance will have disappeared. Sir Julian, as a Humanist, takes the view that all phenomena are at least potentially capable of being investigated by the methods of science. Even 'values' can and must be scientifically studied. (3) Religion. Theism must be abolished for it implies a dualistic theory of the universe, i.e. ' the existence of a basic and essential cleavage between natural and supernatural realms of being' (p. 39). Theism is the enemy of progress and of moral, rational, or religious improvement (p. 40).2 While 'the central belief of Evolutionary Humanism is that existence can be improved, that vast untapped possibilities can be increasingly realised, that greater fulfilment can replace frustration ' (p. 48). That is a brief summary of the main ideas presented to the reader by Sir Julian in his introductory chapter which ends on page 48. The remainder of The Humanist Frame (some 330 pages in the form of 25 chapters by different authors) is concerned with expanding and examining more closely those same ideas which the Editor had either explicitly or implicitly been foreshadowing. It will suffice to summarise the more salient among these -ignoring for the moment (for the sake of lucidity) the question of how much has been derived from and foreshadowed by Sir Julian himself and how much is original. 1 How astonishingly temperate and patient is the above phrasing-when one bears in mind the utterly absurd way in which theologians (even these days) often insist that their theological dialectic is ' science' i 2 This is also the contention of J. B. Bury in The Idea of Progress (1920), and is en- dorsed by Professor Morris Ginsberg in his volume Evolution and Progress, London, 1961, pp. 5 and 6. 48</page><page sequence="9">REVIEWS As man becomes more educated belief in supernatural religion wanes and humanist ways of thinking and acting increase in the world generally. As religion has waned fear has declined and in proportion as fear has declined toleration has increased. The world under humanism and through educa- tion is bound to move, sooner or later, towards 'planetary democracy ', towards a 'world-view'. As this develops contemporary Capitalism will have to undergo drastic change for, as things are, the many are (relatively) sacrificed to the few. Now that man is free from the petrifying influence of religious dogmas, and since the essence of all being is change, progress is certain under man's sole direction, provided he can avoid the twin cosmic dangers-total war and the threat of the rapidly rising world population. Possibly also we should fear Ad-mass-the reduction of individual and cultural differences to a common level of boring uniformity. But, as to this third possible obstacle to the attainment of a more perfect human society, although it is dealt with or touched on by most of the contributors, from their own particular angle, there is a lack of total agreement. Most of those who consider this threat to our future society seem persuaded that ni our future evolution we will still succeed in preserving the (rightly prized) individual variety and not degenerate into stereotyped mass-men. But the bogey so haunts the book, one can wonder if it does not denote a consider- able anxiety. The fine arts as long as they remain true and pure could provide an antidote to the ills of Ad-mass, but if we are not quick the arts generally will be found to have been themselves contaminated by those same ills. But, on the whole, apart from a few misgivings here and there, and a few solemn warnings, the contributors to The Humanist Frame are sanguine for man's future. In fact their ' belief in progress' is, on the whole, pro- digious and lends a refreshing dynamism to the whole volume. As one writer puts it '... our progress in the future will be as great, or possibly far greater, than what our long line of ancestors achieved . . .' (p. 403). And, what is more (unlike much nineteenth-century belief in progress the vision of which was often purely material), these present humanists visualise man's progress as being just as vitally moral and spiritual as it is material. 3 Critical Evaluation There are, however, serious defects in The Humanist Frame. (a) The book is far from even. Some of the essays are most scholarly, lucidly written, well-balanced, are fully based on the most up-to-date findings of contemporary science and show the contributors to have genuine scientific insight. As such, these have an honourable contribution to make to the philosophy of science. But in the others which seem (to the present writer) to lower the standard of this symposium we find, variously, serious defects. One finds an appalling style, often incoherently and 'woolly', D 49</page><page sequence="10">REVIEWS almost as if the writer were at pains to prevent the reader from having any inkling as to what he meant. And then there is the obsession, on the part of some of the contributors, with themes that may seem fascinating enough to bemuse and beguile those idle enough to hanker after strange excitements, but hardly worthy of the proud avowed aim of those who would have man 'the sole agent for the future evolution of this planet '. (b) Again the book has the almost inevitable defect of symposiums. It wants completeness. And there is considerable overlapping and insufficient unity. As far as incompleteness is concerned, it should be admitted that Sir Julian, in a footnote, confesses that there should have been (if only it had been thought about in time) a chapter on Humour and Satire. But ought there not also to have been chapters on (say) the function of philosophy (or should one say of 'anti-metaphysic '?) in a Humanist World? Or again, a chapter on Poetry? Even if it be true that Poetry is dead, or dying,1 we surely want to know-and this is not inapposite to the philosophy of science-what cause (physical, physiological, psychological or any other) there can be of such a ' death '; and we should want to know whether a society that was losing Poetry (or at least the making of new Poetry) might for any good reason be expected, on the whole, to be 'better off' than the Societies of the Past which seemed to derive much sustenance from the productions of the poets. It is not irrelevant to ask whether the human race is nearer to consummation if and when it has outgrown ' poetic experience '. As to overlapping and insufficient unity. This is considerable, and surely might have been avoided by fuller consultation between the various con- tributors and the Editor. For example the threat of world over-population is treated by quite a few of the contributors. Admittedly they make their points generally from different angles and in relation to a different back- ground subject-matter. Yet one gets the feeling that if there had been more mutual consultation the whole would have benefited by a certain linguistic economy that would have given the symposium a much needed 'stream- lining '. Or again, there is a chapter on ' The Democratic Challenge'. This is in effect on Political Science and it is very good. Separated from it by nearly 200 pages (why the separation?) is a chapter on ' Humanist Economics '-also very good. One reason why it is so good is that the writer does not try to discuss Economics in vacuo but discusses it in relation to forms of Political Organisation. But one cannot help feeling that if the two contributors had got together before setting their thoughts down on paper, they would have done an even better job. A good deal of The Humanist Frame is most 1 A prevalent belief in these days. See F. R. Leavis in New Bearings in English Poetry, London, I95O, pp. 5 and 214.

What we need is to see more and more clearly all the separate departments of mind and of human life not any longer as separate isolated 'islands' of knowledge and of living activities but as organic parts of a unified whole; each part, because of its organic relationship with its ' other', implying its coexistence and thereby completing its own meaning. What is written in 'The Democratic Challenge' does stand as true (or mainly true) on its own. And what is written in 'Humanist Economics' also stands as truly on its own. But a more useful, because more compre- hensive and more fully integrated, insight into the total politico-economic world situation might well have been expected to have emerged had these two able contributors got together. It cannot be enough to leave it to the reader to make the necessary integration here. (c) Last, but by no means least, the book is dominated by a most curious enigma. The name of a Jesuit Priest (the late Teilhard de Chardin) is frequently introduced into the pages so that one 1 of his chief works may be either quoted or paraphrased, or (at least) be commended to the reader as a work that he would do well to study. We have to bear in mind (I) that these humanists explicitly reject any allegiance to supernatural religion, and (2) that Teilhard de Chardin in The Phenomenon of Man is not concerned merely with some secular non-theistic theme but that, in fact, he is explicitly concerned to vindicate not merely a general theism but specifically the Christian Religion. Now it is to be admitted that only a relatively small part of this book of the Jesuit is occupied with theistic argument; most of it is an exposition of science, much of which is sufficiently valid. And the contributors to The Humanist Frame who use Teilhard's name do so almost exclusively with reference to science rather than to theology. None the less, the situation is not a little curious. Firstly, because in the chapters where Teilhard is either paraphrased or quoted with reference to his science, there is nothing really original, noth- ing that is not known to other scientists (i.e. biologists) independently of Teilhard's work. Secondly because the Priest seems in most of these instances, if not in all, to be introduced artificially (see pp. 73, 200, 242) and in such a way as to suggest that these humanists are not too sure of themselves and are using Teilhard not because his work is intrinsic to the humanist argument but because they feel the need for an external independent Authority who can be regarded as a revered Sponsor. Can this be the case? If the Priest's name had been used only once or twice one might reasonably console oneself 1 The Phenomenon of Man, London, 1959 5I</page><page sequence="12">REVIEWS with the thought that there is no accounting for tastes, that even pukka intellectuals can occasionally enjoy fleeing monotony in a capricious prank. But the name of Teilhard occurs at least eleven times. A sort of ritual? A talisman? Entertaining (perhaps) if one likes theatre. But incantation should not have found a place in an otherwise sober, dignified, and objective work. But finally (and even more important than either of the two foregoing considerations) one would surely have imagined that finding accommodation for a Priest in The Humanist Frame would be a psychological and moral blunder-the very idea of such a person, quite apart from the relevance or irrelevance of his subject-matter! For, after all, this book is avowedly concerned with being a vehicle of communication of man's 'new revelation '. It is to help (at least 'help '?) to show him ' a new vision of his destiny' (p. 6). It aims at clearing the mind of superstition by indicating (many times) that the traditional supernatural religions have been outgrown, at least by thinking people. Now one is safe in assuming that apart from already professed humanists, most people who read this book will not be professing Christians. They will be thinking people who are keen to know the truth as to what man is, and what man can do, and who have already come to the conclusion that all theistic religions, and their official representatives, are far too naive to be sufficiently true to satisfy the more 'adult' contemporary minds. Well, what are they pretty certain to think as they try to assess The Huma- nist Frame? That they have discovered a work which, on the whole, is sober, sane, rational, but one which is also greatly marred by the seemingly inex- plicable fact that these authors, the professed sponsors of the new revelation, eleven times invoke a ' Priest '-an official Representative of the Old Revela- tion. Let us face facts, and not be ' ostriches '.1 Many educated honest truth- seekers, who know something of the last 2,000 years of human history, cannot avoid associating 'priest' with 'priestcraft' and 'priestcraft' with ' falsehood'. We have here a book, that could have been excellent, spoilt. For all their professions about looking to the future, these humanists, like Lot's wife hankering after Sodom, just have to look back. And yet, notwithstanding the above criticisms, The Humanist Frame is important. Its publication is, as it were, a crucial point in the evolution of Human Society. For it is the first time in thousands of years of belief in Theism, and of all the superstitions associated therewith, that a band of people, distinguished for their learning in their several fields have had the temerity to get together and express a disbelief ' in supernatural creators, rulers, or influences. ' And at the same time expressing their faith in the ability of mankind to achieve the progressive betterment of the human race 1 Sir Julian's exhortation on p. 2I. 52</page><page sequence="13">REVIEWS through reason and science. Nay more, many of the contributors state in varying ways that not a few of humanity's past ills have been either due to, or sustained by, Religious Belief. All this must be regarded as a landmark in man's development. And the important thing here is surely that it is not so much a landmark in the history of human thought as a landmark in the emancipation of the human spirit. The very appearance of The Humanist Frame is significant of a new freedom-not just of mind, but of the whole man. For here we have men and women who are not merely daring to think 'all out', without the traditional inhibitions bred out of superstitions, but who also dare, in their happy courage, to say what they think. This is new, new in the history of so-called Western or Graeco-Christian Civilisation. There were, to be sure, people who thought freely before- in much the same way (in general) as do these present-day Humanists. In the pre-Christian world there were Epicurus and Lucretius and their followers. And in the so-called Christian centuries (nearly 2,000 years) there were from time to time, to be found, even in ' Christian' countries, individual thinkers and writers who proclaimed freethinking humanist doctrines. This is admirably illustrated by Mrs Margaret Knight in her Humanist Anthology. But The Humanist Frame is, in certain important respects, unique. It is not only a new challenge to old-fashioned theistic ways of thinking about man and the universe in the sense that this present challenge is based on more and better science than was available to humanists of the past. Although this is true and significant. It is also, and just as vitally, a challenge to traditional thinking in that these twenty-six reputable contributors are not only in obvious agreement among themselves about fundamentals, but also because they are thinking and writing, for a vast number of people who, although they feel 1 that many doctrines and traditions are false (being based on ignorance and superstition), have not got the education or ability to work out for themselves just how mankind and life and the universe must be viewed in the light of contemporary science. It is obvious therefore that even if at some (distant?) time in future history, many of the chapters in The Humanist Frame will be viewed by our posterity as containing obsolete science and mistaken opinion, that the work will not appear even then as any less of a landmark 2 in the history of the fight for freedom of thought. ALAN L. STUART 1 This needs no proof. One has only to bear in mind such facts as that most people do not attend Church any more (except for very special occasions); or again most people have ceased to believe that national calamities are to be attributed to the will of God. They assume a natural cause. 2 There were rights and wrongs in ' the fall of the Bastille ' in 1789. But that event is today as ever not any less of a landmark on a road towards political and social freedom. 53</page></plain_text>
