Newton Introduction: The shocking young men and their infuriating thesis The purpose of the paper is to examine the roots of our obligation to preserve the land and its resources, to address in some systematic way the "So what?" response to the massive documentation of environmental dete rioration and the accompanying environmentalist imperatives. We will begin with an exercise in deconstruction?the parsing of an event, just one event, to extract from its account some of the problems that environmental ism has got itself into, especially in dealing with the multiple faces of American business. From that point we will be in a position to address the central project of the paper, an elaboration of an ethic for the appreciation and protection of the natural environment, "the land," for short, meaning the earth, all its life, all its resources. The event in question was the presentation of a paper at a meeting of environmental funding agencies, hardly the sort of thing that normally ruffles the feathers of angels dancing on the heads of pins. The program of the meeting featured reflections from a variety of sources on the status of the nation's environmental initiatives. To the enormous chagrin of the leaders of the environmental movement, two relative youngsters, Michael Shell enberger and Ted Nordhaus, upended what had been a relatively unified forum with an argument that environmentalism, as a movement, was dead, ?

The paper they presented at that meeting, "The Death of Environmentalism," argued that the political support that had nourished the movement was tired and gone, and that liberals should be "abolishing the category" of environmentalism as part of their politics. Environmentalism, in its parochial insistence on preserving the land and the forests, had become "just another special interest;" it was simply pass?, had lost its appeal to the voters, had in general overstayed its welcome in what sounded for all the world like the worn tent of the Democratic Party. It is time, they argued, to move the strategic money to a variety of liberal and progressive causes that had a greater chance to woo the electorate.1 Needless to state, the paper set off a storm in the environmentalist movement. Some major environmentalists wrote angry answers refuting the pair. Others, including Bill McKibben, thought that they had a point. Nicholas Krist?f, columnist for The New York Times also thought they were right; environmentalists had been alarmists, and now they were paying for it.2 Debates raged and positions were taken. But the event has much deeper problems buried in it than the simple question of whether it is "time to move on." Let us bullet a few of them. First: the major objection that the establishment environmentalists had to this presentation was that it was given to the funding sources. The picture we are given, of the "environmentalist" or "progressive" movement of which we are supposed to be a part, is that of elegantly titled hucksters competing for funds. Have we come to this? Is this all there is? The question is not rhetorical. Second: the young men were frankly suggesting nothing more than a "strategy" change. We may infer from the presentation that the authors consider environmentalism to be one of several buzz-tactics, the picking up a fashionable thought to spin it with others into a certain share of the political market, or number of votes. That read imputes to the land no real value at all, in itself?the impassioned rhetoric of environmentalism was just a ploy to get liberal votes, one that isn't working any more so should be abandoned. Like, environmentalism is so last year. But that just can't be right. Land, above all, endures. If the catalog of deterioration is factually correct, then it is a reality that we will have to deal with. It can't be just picked up and dropped again according to judgments of political fashion. Third: was conservation ever a "liberal" or "progressive" cause to begin with? The etymology of the word would suggest not. How might the conservation of nature figure in the politics of liberal and conservative? The</page><page sequence="3">The Forms and Limits of Economic Environmentalism 11 only place to find an answer is in the original division of liberals and conservatives?John Locke and the Glorious Revolution, with all his liberal Utilitarian progeny, furiously opposed by Edmund Burke, the Church, and the defenders of the traditional community. Locke and Adam Smith would reduce all the wild and common places to "wealth," monetize them into private property and the stuff of trade, commodity them. Burke would recognize them as traditional refuges and public goods to be preserved on behalf of the ancestors for the sake of the unborn, and would protect them for their traditional community uses. The fragility of the commons was recognized for centuries, and its only protection was the unbroken tradition prescribing its uses. "The Tragedy of the Commons," the progressive overuse of the commons by its clientele until it is entirely destroyed,3 does not happen while the traditions are intact. It happens when the new, liberal, individualistic and profit-oriented, practices are introduced into an area previously governed by tradition. Where there has been no tradition of restraint, as in the open-access grounds of the ocean fisheries, unrestrained overuse by individualistic entrepreneurs quickly destroys the resource per manently. "Liberalism" is no friend of the environment. Liberalism started the problem, and it is unlikely to provide the solution. (How did the land ever switch parties from red to blue, from conservative to liberal?) Fourth: Never mind what side of the political aisle favors the land. The land is the necessary condition for our continued existence, of whatever party we may be; ultimately, we must take care of the land, or there's no real point to taking care of anything else. As far as politics and policy are concerned, the land must be an end in itself, not a means to anything else, and there is something horrifying in the decision that the efforts to increase public support for that effort are to be tested by political efficacy and pro moted or discarded on the measure of political advantage. How did we ever get so far from the point of the enterprise, the moral of the story, as it were, as to rate conservation only on grounds that have nothing really to do with it? Have we succumbed to a dangerous distraction? A Big Tent for the Land The error made by the young men was misdirection of focus, and the adoption of narrower rather than broader grounds for the support of the environmental movement. When the factual conditions supporting those narrow grounds disappeared?when it no longer seemed that a bearded child of the forest defiantly perched in a redwood tree would reliably draw votes</page><page sequence="4">12 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal on Election Day to various "liberal" causes?the entire "category" could be discarded. But we can think of many reasons beyond that one to defend the land, can't we? Yes, but do they go together or contradict each other? Can they be persuaded to pull in the same direction? Can they possibly be united in a single framework? The purpose of this paper is nothing less than the unification of the rationales for preservation of the land, of the natural environment. We will try to create a framework in which an ordered series of lines of justification may co-exist, logically independent but not incompatible, theoretically distinct but able in practice to reinforce each other. The framework con structed, we will ask some more basic questions on the ultimate grounding of a land ethic, and add some observations on outliers (lines of justification that lie outside the framework). We may find at the end that the outrageous young men may not have been so far off base after all. An Environmental Ethics Classification System Our defense of the environment starts with the very simplest correlation of present damage to the environment and present harm to us: if we empty the used oil into the river above where the drinking water is taken out, we're going to be drinking oil for awhile. The defense concludes with a grateful recognition of our dependence on the land for every aspect of our being, and a fervent desire to protect and preserve it for all future generations. Within that range, a variety of "environmentalisms" jostle for ascendancy. They can be divided according to the three major sets of drivers, or motivations, which underlie them, drivers we may call the Payoff motive, the Citizenship motive, and the Land motive. As we shall see, the Payoff motive is very easy for American business to work with; the Citizenship motive is conflict ridden but eventually workable; and the Land motive, while perhaps more firmly grounded than either of the others, is in practice presently more aspirational than employable. A project for our time is to construct the institutions that will make it more workable in market conditions. The three levels subdivide themselves into two levels each, one generally aimed at avoiding penalties and one generally aimed at attaining some good end, and permit of a certain amount of flexibility and extension. First, some definitions. The standard against which all environmental damage, enhancement, or restoration is measured is the health of the ecosystem. This is a very medical model: the health of the patient, ability to function normally, ability to recover from insults, etc., is the measure.</page><page sequence="5">The Forms and Limits of Economic Environmentalism 13 Specifically, "environmental" damage is damage to an ecosystem (primar ily) or to some non-domestic non-human species within an ecosystem (secondarily). Damage to humans through some environmental vector will be worth notice, but not as "environmental" damage. Dumping oil in the river damages the environment, since the oil harms many forms of life in the ecosystem; dumping cholera germs in the river, although it certainly has the potential to harm many humans, probably does little harm to the environ ment, so does not cause environmental damage. Bioterrorism, therefore, other things being equal, is not an environmental attack, nor was the explo sion of methyl isocyanate in Bhopal in 1984 (for instance) a case of envi ronmental damage. We will be interested in events that harm the environ ment by interfering with all life, especially with the key actors and factors in an intact ecosystem (the "keystone" species, for instance, that make it possible for the ecosystem to regulate itself); harm to humans will be measured on a different scale, as interfering not just with the lives and health of human beings but also with their prosperity, income, freedom, power, and quality of life. Payoff Level One Avoiding Harm We ought to protect the natural environment from damages that will also hurt human beings. The point of this rule is the prevention of immediate self-injury, like pouring the oil into the water upriver. (It amounts to the suggestion that it is not a good idea to get rid of a rock by throwing it straight up; you might get hit by it on the way down.) Nor is it a good idea to have a garbage dump uphill from good farmland, unless it has a very good liner. Simple prudence, and an alert department of Public Health, operate at this level to protect us and the environment from simple negli gence. As our levels of analysis become a bit more sophisticated, we are able to expand Level One beyond the immediate and obvious to the more distant and probable: if it turns out that burning trash in the back yard produces a very large amount of dioxin, a ferociously toxic chlorine compound, harmful to all higher fish and mammals and carcinogenic to humans, then it would seem the better part of valor to confiscate the barrels and provide a good public trash disposal plan.4 The further in the future the expected harm is predicted, and the less certain that it will come about, the harder it will be to justify the expense of protection. While the dangers of</page><page sequence="6">14 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal ingesting motor oil are perfectly clear, the effect of the dioxins is disputable; while the oil will contaminate the water immediately, it isn't clear when the cancer that is caused by the dioxin will manifest itself in any human. Pour ing the oil somewhere else than the river might actually be cost-free; creat ing a municipal trash disposal plan is not. Payoff Level Two Seeking Advantage We ought to adopt all those measures that will protect or restore the environment and produce an immediate profit. Discovering that "organic" food, food that can be labeled and advertised as raised without the use of chemical pesticides or herbicides, genetically unaltered and ripened in the field, commanded significantly higher prices than food from crops raised with the usual chemical entourage, many farmers in areas close to sophisti cated markets promptly began organic farming. Similarly, in 1975 the 3M company, distressed by the high costs in remediation required by govern ment regulation that would be incurred if its plant's heavy level of emissions were to continue, undertook a program called "Pollution Prevention Pays (3P)" to eliminate the problem at its source. It reconstituted its products and modified its manufacturing processes to cut the toxic waste as close to zero as possible, and in the process saved money on raw materials: about $827 million just between 1975 and 1999, eliminating eight-hundred thousand tons of pollutants at the same time.5 As with Level One, Level Two easily extends into the middle range of certainty and immediacy. It makes sense to design the plant buildings and processes in such a way as to minimize the use of energy and consumption of raw materials generally, even if they cost more to build up front; it makes sense on the farm to preserve wildlife corridors and woodland habitats, if they'll shelter the pollinators and preda tor insects that help the crops. Payoff Levels One and Two should be familiar enough to veterans of the Environmental Economics literature; they are generally referred to as "industrial ecology," or "green business strategy." They are known and accepted. They should also be familiar to students of the Ethics literature: they correspond, rather neatly, to Lawrence Kohlberg's first two stages of moral development: in this "preconventional" stage, an act is wrong if it produces foreseeable punishment and "right" if it produces foreseeable reward.6 The ethical framework is straightforward act utilitarianism. While</page><page sequence="7">The Forms and Limits of Economic Environmental is m 15 we're on that subject, it is worth remembering that Jeremy Benthan intended his ethical theory, hedonism, the Pleasure Principle, or Utilitarianism, as it came to be called, to be usable with mathematical accuracy. Utilitarian calculations set up equations among the various options for a decision for action, finding the results of each act in terms of pleasure and pain?dura tion, intensity, purity, fecundity, and don't forget the major factors in the "extended" cases above?propinquity (how long before the effect occurs?) and certainty (how likely is the effect?) The more uncertain and distant the effect, the less the weight in any ethical decision. Not only is a bird in the hand worth two in the bush, but if we're in the birdselling business, a bird now is worth two birds later. This kind of reasoning is also familiar to corporate decision makers, charged with maximizing good (income rather than pleasure) and minimizing pain (costs and losses), and more or less easily justifiable to Boards of Directors, more if the reward (or avoidance of cost) is sooner, larger and more certain, less if it is later, smaller and less certain. But business motivation can be more complex than the simple Payoff, just as can individual motivation. The corporation must carry on its activities within a society, within a legal system, within shared understand ings of right and wrong, within a local community. There is much that the corporation does which is only explicable in terms of its felt obligation to be a good citizen in its communities. The Citizenship driver permits us to elaborate two more levels of corporate environmentalism. Citizenship Level Three Compliance We live in a complex society governed by Rule of Law, upon which every corporation depends for its existence. (Those who would like a proof of that are referred to Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, the part about mean, poor, nasty, brutish and short.)7 Whatever else we may think about our duties to our fellow members of society, we have at least the obligation to obey the law. It is within the power of the electorate, acting through their duly elected representatives (and the duly appointed officers of government agencies established by the legislature) to enact legislation to protect our natural heritage for the sake of all the citizens, of this generation and of those to follow. Citizenship requires at least obedience to the law?compliance with existing law in the letter. Does it also require obedience in spirit?</page><page sequence="8">16 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal Ordinarily we distinguish easily between law and ethics. Law, on the ordinary acceptance, consists of definition and instruction that proceed from the legitimate authority, at whatever level, is written down, obedience to which is monitored, breach of which will incur punishments. (The first two parts of the definition are from St. Thomas Aquinas, the second two are from John Austin; I hope those familiar with legal theory will enjoy the meld of Natural Law Theory and Legal Positivism.)8,9 Ethics, however, beyond the law, indicates what people might like other people to do, preferences, beliefs about what is right and wrong. It is not law. But there is a third element of the law, beside what is written down and what is enforced. The problem is, that much of our legal experience is in a gray area at the edges of what is written down; it consists in the penumbra of legal expectations that attend civil behavior in a civil society. When the courts of law find one of these gray-area cases before them, especially in an area relatively new to the law, subject to change and to interpretation?in short, an area very like the field of environmental regulation?often the only rule of interpretation available to them is to follow the intent and the spirit of the law. So the extension of the "legal" obligation into the range of "ethics" may be where the courts come down?and as the Legal Realists always claimed, what the courts will decide in fact is (for the practicing business person) the best definition of "law."10 If avoiding unfavorable court decisions is part of "compliance" (and if I were part of a corporation's legal staff, I would certainly think it so to be), then simple compliance requires that the manager take into account the purpose and spirit of the law in plotting the corporation's path. Citizenship Level Four Contributions Beyond complete (and willing) compliance with all applicable legal provi sions, the corporation often cultivates and satisfies community expectations of a higher standard of citizenship, or neighborliness. Beyond anything the law requires, the corporation has a certain amount of leeway in deciding neighborly courses of action, all of which may commend it to its commu nity, and redound to its advantage in terms of customer loyalty, community support for expansion plans, and all other benefits summarized as "good will." The record of corporate contributions, at least from about the 1950s until fairly recently, is impressive: major corporations have sponsored the</page><page sequence="9">The Forms and Limits of Economic Environmentalism 17 weekly broadcasting of the Metropolitan Opera performances, funded con cert series, public radio, built libraries, art museums, hospitals, concert halls, and please let us not forget, universities. The United States has possibly the most powerful "third sector" in the world: the area of not for profit enterprise, serving an astonishingly large variety of health-related, cultural and educational institutions. The huge fund of voluntary contributions that supports these interests comes in part from individuals, but also in large part from corporations. Among the community-oriented contributions that a company might make are many that help the natural environment: com panies have dedicated portions of their sprawling grounds to conservation as nature preserves (a move that is easier to sell to the Board of Directors if that part of the property has wetlands on it and the tax write-off is substan tial), have sponsored beach cleanups and wildlife preservation plans, and have contributed to innumerable environmental educational programs, especially for children. Why do they do this? Part of the explanation may lie at the Payoff level?the company wants the good will of its neighbors for the sake of a variety of possible future advantages, just as it does not want to risk the fines consequent on non-compliance with the law. But what is interesting is the part of the motivation that goes beyond Payoff, to the strong social bonds that bind humans into communities, regardless of the roles they play in their institutions. We evolved as a social species, a point worth re membering. We need no elaborate reasons to justify our concern for the welfare of other human beings (especially those close to us), or our indignation at manifest injustice in the social structures that govern their lives. These orientations to our fellow humans are as much part of our wiring as our ligaments and arteries. The corporation, to be sure, is not a human, and by the terms of its charter, its officers are under a fiduciary duty to that corporation to concern themselves only with increasing wealth for the owners, the shareholders. But in the fluid perceptions of persons, fictive and real, corporations assume personalities, manifested by the behavior of the corporate officers, and managers and neighbors alike will expect that corporation not only to act within the bounds of the law but also to entertain near-human concern for the community in which it resides. Citizenship, the equivalent to "conventional thinking" in the work of Lawrence Kohlberg, has one more task before we leave it. Post-conven tional thinking goes beyond what the world expects of the individual or corporation, explicitly or implicitly. It summons as justification for actions</page><page sequence="10">18 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal not what the world expects, but what is right. Corporate officers, given their fiduciary duties, can rarely do this sort of thing on their own; initiatives not required by law on penalty of fine or rewarded in the tax structure are very difficult to justify to the owners of the company. Our job as citizens, then, is to create the tax incentives and where necessary, the laws, so that corpo rations can do the right thing and prosper. Essentially, what we will be doing is creating structures of cooperation on behalf of the land. We have tried, in the articulation of these four levels to this point, to show two natural and worthwhile sets of motivations for protecting the environment. We have tried to lose, forever, the charge of "hypocrisy," slung at corporations that act out of good citizenship, the charge that insists that corporations "only" act on behalf of the natural environment in order to get payoffs. First, Payoff is not a bad motive; given the structure of the corporation, as a matter of fact, it's a very good one. Second, it isn't the only one; there are lots of things we do just to be good citizens. Third, there may be no clear way to distinguish between the motivations in the actor's mind, even by the actor himself?human motivation is notoriously shifting and complex, and the owner of the motivation may be in the worst position to say exactly what it is. But motivations can go further still. Beyond being a good citizen, a corporation, through its officers, might aspire to do what is right, to save the land for the sake of the land. In the next section, we will seek some further grounding for that aspiration. Meanwhile, what would it look like? What must we do for the land? Apart from the economic structures of profit, the Payoff level, and the social structures of cooperative action within a social setting with its own intangible structures of reward and punishment, the Citizenship level, how may any corporation view its obligations to the land itself? Here a variety of structures present themselves, none of them indis putable, in fact none of them currently undisputed. We will divide the general obligations into two categories, as with the other levels, the first emphasizing the need to avoid evil, the second emphasizing the need to do good. These will raise, and in the next section we will go on to confront, the more fundamental question: on what ethical structure can a true land ethic be based? How do we ground the human obligation to the land?</page><page sequence="11">The Forms and Limits of Economic Environmentalism 19 Land Level Five Sustainability The general definition of "sustainability" is well known, derived from the 1987 report of the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), Our Common Future (also known as the Brundtland Report, after Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway and Chair of the Commission).11 The Report defines sustainability as "meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future genera tions to meet their own needs," or in very short, to do what you're doing in such a way that you can do it indefinitely without running out of something you need for it. Simple prudence will carry you through Payoff Level One and Citizenship Level Three?don't poison your own well, and don't run afoul of the law. But the prudence that attends Level Five is earth-centered, very long term, and anything but simple. The net environmental effect that any enterprise has on the natural environment is called its "footprint"; the requirement that must be met in order to satisfy Level Five is Zero Footprint, or Net Footprint Zero. The requirement means that the ecosystem must exist around your enterprise as if you were not there. More realistically, no demands must be made on nature, either in its role of supplying resources or its role in absorbing wastes, that cannot be repaid in the course of a normal year. This condition is not only theoretically obtainable, it has been obtained in fact in numbers of institutions.12 Recall, the human race lived completely without footprint, in Europe and the Americas, for at least 40,000 years, and in Africa for several millennia prior to that. Not until the development of agriculture did the forests, and then the land, start to disappear, and it is possible (we now know) to conduct some sorts of agriculture in such a way that it will leave no footprint indefinitely. The grounds for the requirement of sustainability rest on simple aversion to extinction. If we wear out the land, we cease to eat. If we diminish, below a certain point, the carpet of green that originally covered the earth, by unrestricted logging in the Amazon and in the deep rainforests of the Congo, for instance, we will cut off the oxygen supply to creatures that need oxygen to live, like us.13,14 We have had the warnings, large and small. We know that individual civilizations, from small island communi ties like Easter Island to the entire Mayan civilization of Mesoamerica have collapsed, horribly, because they have overstressed the natural resources</page><page sequence="12">20 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal that they were given.15 We know that agricultural practices in the "Fertile Crescent," stretching along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, north of the great desert and west to the Mediterranean Sea, destroyed the most fertile farmland in the world over the course of a few thousand years, and that it will take at least that to reclaim that land from its present condition as a desert.16 We have had sufficient warnings on the perils of climate change, "global warming"?from the ultra-serious, like Gus Spetti's Red Sky at Morning17 to the vastly entertaining, like the blockbuster movie, The Day After Tomorrow?to recognize the formation of a small industry of know ledge and communication. There is a sense in which the very volume of the warnings is counter-productive, judged by the usual standards for judging warnings: people tend not to pay attention after awhile (more on this point when we get back to the outrageous young men, below). That does not make the predictions false. But aversion to extinction cannot explain the whole of the duty to the land at this level. After all, not only will the final failure of oxygen occur very far in the future, but it will probably hit others, less fortunate and healthy than our descendants, before our family is touched. Simple fear cannot govern a decision to change a factory's waste systems in order to stop harmful emissions and slow down global warming. The effect is too far from the action. There is another duty, here, a duty not to harm the earth, even when the ultimate results of the injuries are too far to contem plate. On what might that duty be based? Land Level Six Recovery of Harmony At the last level of stewardship for the land, the enterprise becomes one of restoring the balances that have been lost in the last destructive 10,000 years of human history (starting with the last 200!). The retreat from technology suggested in the last level reverses itself; we need more technology, new and better technology, to get us the life we want at a vastly lower cost to the biosphere. The key to this level is simplicity, and the workings out of the simple life. The move to simplicity must begin, of course, with human consump tion. First as individuals (later as a business community and as a nation) we need to interrogate everything we do or buy, asking: do we need this? If we need this, how can it be done or obtained more simply, more economically?</page><page sequence="13">The Forms and Limits of Economic Environment alism 21 (On occasion, How would nature do it?18 We know, for example, that spider silk is stronger, pound for pound, than steel, and would make us sails and body armor stronger and lighter than Kevlar.19 Are we as smart as the spiders?) How can it be done to make the maximum use of renewable energy, especially solar and wind energy, renewable materials, while encouraging and appreciating the work and life of the ecosystem native to the region? Simplicity, as a way of life, is what we call "normatively over determined"?that is, there are too many good reasons to pursue it to know which one is primary. For centuries, saints and sages have urged us to adopt the simple life just for the sake of the health of our individual souls and bodies and for the sake of happiness in our own lives. For our unsimple society?the morbidly obese, overconsumption society?is not new: Greek philosophers knew it and rejected it, Roman philosophers, Stoic and Epicurean, knew it at the height of material frenzy in imperial Rome and rejected it, and most famously, Christian religious leaders, epitomized by St. Francis of Assisi, rejected it and lived the rejection in lives of voluntary poverty. Sometimes the Christians wrote as if we should live simple lives in order to please God, in a variant of Divine Command theory, but for the most part Christians and pagans alike urged the simple life for the sake of happiness, our happiness. The overconsumption life is one of constant frustration, since the satisfaction of a material desire does nothing except multiply more of its kind?the more you have the more you want, as our mothers used to say. The key to a good life is early discipline of desire, an ordered life in which sufficiency guarantees happiness and, freed from the constant clawings for "more," the human can direct his or her attention to personal fulfillment in work and in learning. A second determination of the value of simplicity is captured in the bumper sticker (why do we think more and more in bumper stickers?) "Live Simply that Others May Simply Live." We live in an unjust world, one where poverty, not the voluntary kind, rules the lives of most of the human inhabitants. 1.1 billion of the world's six billion people live in "extreme poverty," attempting to live on an income of less than $1 per day, unable to meet basic needs for survival, lacking all necessities. This poverty kills. "Currently, more than 8 million people around the world die each year because they are too poor to stay alive."20 The next level of poverty, "moderate poverty," means living on between $1 and $2 per day, hardly munificence. We know we can stop this, can end poverty all over the world</page><page sequence="14">22 Business Sc Professional Ethics Journal in our generation. Jeffrey Sachs, star economist from Columbia University, shows us how. It's easy; all wealthy countries like the U.S. have to do is raise the proportion of foreign aid to 0.7 percent of GNP. Right now the U.S. donates at a level of 0.15 percent of GNP, fifteen cents for every $ 100. Why don't we give more? We're too busy getting fat, apparently. So far, that gives us two sufficient reasons to live the simple life: we will be happier ourselves and there will be much more of the world's resources left over for the poor of the world. The third reason is the one we came in for: if, as individuals and as a society, we live in simplicity, we will put less of a strain on the world's ecosystems. We have been operating for centuries?millennia, better?as if the natural world were nothing but an endless source of usable stuff (a huge Wal-Mart, but free), and a bottomless sink for discarded waste. That has to change: We must learn, or re-learn, how to live and work in harmony with nature and natural processes?in short, how to be part of the ecosystem. The immediate implication for us as individuals is to govern our personal lives by simplicity. The implication for American business is simplicity in process and product. The effort to simplify?to reduce the use of raw materials and energy altogether, to create every product so that it can be completely reused or reassembled and recycled, to leave absolutely no footprint on the ecosystem in which the enterprise is carried on?must pervade the entirety of the enterprise, root and branch. The Grounding of the Land Ethic All of the above devolves into one simple proposition: for our own health and the health of the human race we will have to preserve the health of the ecosystems in which we live, and that work will require of us a radical change in technology, economic understandings, political alliances and lifestyle. Throughout, the grounds presented have been prudential, utili tarian in the largest sense of the word, derived from consequences, evil and good, foreseen with more certainty or less. The arguments seem to be powerful enough to carry the day. Still, it would be good to complete the account with an overview of a deontological ethic of the land; a derivation of the duty to treat the land, the ecosystems individually and the biosphere as a whole, with respect and care. This attempt has been made, several times. Let me go briefly through three accounts that I know will work, that is, if we accept the worldview presented as premise, they will logically support strong obligations of environmental care. Specifically, they will</page><page sequence="15">The Forms and Limits of Economic Environmentalism 23 justify the adoption of the unfamiliar goals of zero footprint and harmonious cooperation. We will say in advance that one of them we find powerful, sufficient, but not available to everyone; one of them we have a great deal of difficulty accepting; and the third we think is largely right. Justification One The Earth as God's Creation On Divine Command theory, the all-sufficient word of God, in Whom we live, and move, and have our being, determines our obligation to the land. Christians have a clear text, Genesis Chapter 2 Verse 15, in which God sets the original humans in the Garden, the created world, to tend and to keep it. Adding complementary passages as a gloss on that one, we may start with the testimony that God created all Nature, enumerated as waters, green plants, and all animals, and saw it all, and announced that it was good. In that case the Garden we have been given to take care of includes the entire world and every living thing that is in it, and God thought it was good just as it proceeded from His hand and was given to us. (That thought will ground the attribution of "inherent worth" to Nature.) We are therefore God's stewards of the earth, which remains His, and was never ours. (The implications of the act of Creation are made clearer in Psalm 24: "The Earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof, the world, and they that dwell therein, for He hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods.") It is clearly God's will that in caring for the earth, we should try to preserve its original condition, and return it to Him at the end of days in a condition as close as possible to its condition at Creation. Of course that only raises more questions than it answers. Why, centrally, should we care what God wants us to do? Christians are given a variety of reasons. Elsewhere in Scripture, for starters, we find out that God intends to hold us accountable for every action or failure to act in every field in which he has given laws or statutes or instructions of any kind, and the punishments that God has in mind for those who fail to act as faithful stewards dwarf any that Federal judges might be able to come up with. To complete that thought, God also has powerful rewards available for those who carry out his instructions faithfully. Simple prudence, as with the original Payoff levels, would suggest careful preservation of the earth. The major difference is that on Divine Command Theory, no payoff is available until after death.</page><page sequence="16">24 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal More powerful reasons, though, have nothing to do with reward or punishment. As with the Citizenship level of secular motivation, "solidarity with humanity," especially with the poor, is one of the central commands. We are commanded, in the central tradition that grounds all Abrahamic religion, to love God with all our heart and soul and mind and strength, and to love our neighbor as ourselves. (On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.) For information on who is to count as "neigh bor," we are referred to the parable of the Good Samaritan: our neighbor is anyone who is in trouble, and we act as a "neighbor" ought to act when we minister to that person. We don't have to look far for people in trouble; all over the world humans suffer from poverty caused at least in part by environmental degradation, and we are urged to develop all our policies at home and abroad with a "preferential option for the poor"?with special attention to the way the poor of the world will be affected by them. We know for a fact that the poor are hurt most when environmental damage is done; we are therefore under special obligation from God to prevent and remedy that damage. On a third level, as with the secular reasoning, Divine Command theory's implications do not depend on the needs of other humans any more than they depend on personal payoffs. They have a great deal to do with this beautiful Earth, and with our love and gratitude to God for giving it to us. God has given us our lives, our potential for happiness and fulfillment, and a promise of everlasting love and eternal life, and it is only fitting for us to show gratitude for all God's gifts. How might we do this? "If you love me, keep my commandments," said Jesus, and Christians, at least, strive to do that. Among the commandments, not mentioned specifically by Jesus who was concerned with other matters, is the imperative to preserve the natural world in the condition in which it was created (as far as possible). We should do this not only on the assurance that we will be held to account for our stewardship at the Last Day, not only for the sake of our fellow pilgrims through this time of trial, but also out of sheer love for its beauty and thankfulness for its fruitful generosity, translated into love for its Creator and a burning desire to do His will. Is Divine Command a sufficient basis for a duty to protect the natural environment? Certainly yes, for a person of sufficient faith; consider that faith was a sufficient motivator for Mother Teresa to devote her life to service to the very poorest people in the world, and she was not the first, nor will she be the last. But just as clearly, certainly not, for one who does not</page><page sequence="17">The Forms and Limits of Economic Environment alism 25 share the theistic worldview required. For a nonbeliever, "God commanded it," is completely irrelevant, whether the subject be adultery, taking the name of the Lord in vain, saving the trees, tithing to the Church, or abstaining from flesh on Good Friday. And there are other limitations to the Divine Command approach. As we have seen in our generation, there are sects of evangelical Christianity that hold to a rigid timetable determining the end of the Time itself and the heavens and the earth (when a new heaven and earth shall be created), and believe that that end, the Apocalypse (preceded, of course, by the Rapture!), is coming soon. Adherents to those sectarian views hold the natural environment to be of little worth, since it's about to be destroyed anyway. (Imagine our surprise when the Secretary of the Interior under President Ronald Reagan announced himself to be part of such a sect, which is rather like putting a vegetarian in charge of the meat packing inspections, or an avowed pacifist as Secretary of Defense. That, on the other hand, might not be a bad idea.) For those who believe strongly that God has appointed us as stewards of Creation, to return it in as good shape as we found it for God's sake, Divine Command theory works as motivator, justification, and its own reward. But as we see, even Christianity is dicey on the subject of steward ship, split among several traditions of interpretation, and the theory is useless in talking with others not of the faith about the duty of stewardship. (The purpose of secular ethics is at the least to enable people of widely different traditions of faith and morals to engage in reasoned discussion about right conduct in difficult situations.) The Divine Command line of justification is then broadly inadequate or inapplicable, but it retains one virtue: it is one of the very few frameworks that can continue to justify right conduct in the course of a lifetime without visible or tangible sanctions or rewards. For this reason, no environmentalist will want to see it abandoned. Justification Two The Earth as a Living Organism In 1961, by his own account, in the course of developing the science of the first exploration of the moon in search of alien life, James Lovelock and a few of his companions, as part of that investigation, came to consider the necessary conditions for any life to live anywhere. They soon realized that atmosphere and oceans, indeed the entire crust of a planet alive, would have to be part of the transport and maintenance mechanisms of whatever life was</page><page sequence="18">26 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal there.21 This led to the realization that in many ways, our planet, this earth as a whole, is very much alive?that it is one life, self-regulating, self adjusting, a very complex system of chemical balances in reaction to the interactions of the living beings within it. The fascinating part of the discovery was the fact that life itself, all life, seems to run counter to the trend of the universe, where all energy is lost in general entropy. Life is the paradoxical contradiction to the second law, which states that everything is, always has been, and always will be running down to equilibrium and death. Yet life evolves to ever greater complexity and is characterized by an omnipresence of improbability that would make winning a sweepstake every day for a year seem trivial by comparison.22 We, then, are living parts of that improbable living life, as our tissues are to our body, and our bond to the earth, and to its service, is perfectly obvious, whether or not it is written down anywhere or part of any accepted Western Ethic. Reverence and love for the earth as the organism of which we are the tissues, the organs, is associated with a variety of Native American cultures, possibly with that movement in environmental philos ophy known as "deep ecology." Without delving further into these origins, the general implication is perfectly clear: In Gaia we are just another species, neither the owners nor the stewards of this planet. Our future depends much more on a right relationship with Gaia than with the never-ending drama of human interest.23 We are cells within the body of the Earth, the body of Gaia. Given the effect that human activities have on Gaia, what kind of cell might we be? In light of our clear potential to make wise decisions about the future of the earth, we might want to think of ourselves as brain cells. But that's not the way we act. What else might we be? Possibly cancer. The difference between a normal cell and a cancer cell is subtle and not immediately evident; if the difference were clearer, cancer would not be a problem. Ordinarily when a cell mutates into a different and harmful state, the body's immune system recognizes it as different, seizes it and kills it before it can do any damage. But the cancer cell does not appear foreign. It grows like all other cells in the body, apparently harmless, but then begins to partici pate in very strange patterns. It divides, and divides again, growing large</page><page sequence="19">The Forms and Limits of Economic Environmentalism 27 clumps of cells known as "tumors," displacing all healthy cells in its area, interfering mightily with the health and functioning of the body as a whole, threatening to take over the entire biomass of the body for its own purposes. To aid in obtaining that objective, it takes over the body's capacity to grow new blood vessels, and diverts the blood supply to its own needs instead of the needs of the rest of the body. As its reproduction is out of control, it overwhelms the body's ability to remove its wastes, and the toxins from its growth and death clog the systems of blood vessels, gall bladder and liver. Unlike other cells in the body, if cancer cells can be carried from the place where they started to other locations in the body, they can attach themselves to that new location and begin to grow there?again, redirecting the local blood supply to serve them. Ultimately, unless some plague can be found to kill the cancer without killing the rest of the body, the body dies, totally absorbed by the cancer. Humans are a bit like that. Many species of plant and animal will have population explosions ("bombs") now and again, but as they run through their natural food supply and attract their natural predators, the population crashes and gets back into balance?the immune system of the ecosystem, or of Gaia, has destroyed the danger. Generally, in a well-functioning ecosystem, the species are in balance. Now along comes the human species. Evolved as all other species, it is well adapted to the earth, and prospers. But when the population blooms, instead of dying back, it spreads, using its famous (or infamous) ingenuity to coopt new parts of the biota into food for itself, manufacture energy from beneath the earth, and destroy all competing species. (In a few isolated places, like Easter Island, human population follows the classic pattern of boom and bust?but leaves the natural envi ronment infinitely more devastated than any other species could possibly have done.) As cancer kills the body; we will kill the earth, if we are not stopped. But who, or what, could stop us? As intelligent cells of the organism, we alone of all the others have a choice. We can see, as above, what we are doing. We can, at least in theory, elect not to continue on our destructive path. We know what it would be to cure a cancer; we can use similar methods on our species. We can reduce our numbers, cut way back on our consumption of resources, reduce to nothing our toxic effects on the body in which we live. We can determine from a careful analysis of our ecosystem?a task we are very good at?how many people there should be, and how they should live, to protect the health of Gaia, the earth, the sustainer of all of us. It does not</page><page sequence="20">28 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal matter whether our duty to perform this reduction, this withdrawal of dam aging intrusion, is to be derived from ultimate consequences (if we do not do it we are all dead, as per the Land Level 5 motivation, above), deontolog ically (we have a quasi-contractual duty of support for the earth that supports us, for instance), or ontologically (to live in health with the body of which we are a part is necessary for our nature). The duty of the cell, or organ, to serve and protect the body is a simple extension of its definition. Again, this explanation works only if we accept several steps that may have few followers: first, we must accept the "Gaia hypothesis," that the earth as a whole is best understood as a living organism, in which all living things are parts as to a whole; second, we must accept that from that perception, which may be very useful for many purposes, carries moral implications applicable to us as individual duties; and third, we must accept that such inchoate and diffuse duties can be acquired simply from an undifferentiated and unchosen status of human being?"found" duties, as it were. If these claims seem plausible, and many have found them to be, then our duty to protect the earth falls within the same class as the duty of the fetus not to harm its mother?biologically created and determined, but a duty nonetheless. If the claims seem implausible, and a greater number have found them so, then nothing of duty follows from our intimate participation in the web of life we know as the earth. There is a further problem evident in this paradigm, a problem that has been called "ecofascism." My body works as a thoroughly authoritarian system, allowing no flexibility in roles or activities among the cells, all of which are required to serve the interests of the body at all times. (Cancer, as above, defies this authority.) It is possible for the state to work this way, as Plato pointed out approvingly in the Republic, modeling his state on the pattern of the human soul.24 And indeed, I am very glad that my body works this way. But there is an ancient and correct tradition, which says that humans need freedom to function well, and that the organic model suits the human community on the one level, and the biotic community on another, very badly. (Aristotle criticized Plato on this score in his Politics, very effectively.)25 Justification Three The Land as a Community Probably the best candidate for a deontological earth ethic is from Aldo Leopold, the biologist and wildlife manager who became one of our best, in</page><page sequence="21">The Forms and Limits of Economic Environment alism 29 fact our primary, philosopher of the land.26 Leopold's famous statement of the land ethic is from a section of that name in the final section of A Sand County Almanac, "The Upshot." His message, now become the centerpiece of all ecocentric ethics, is simple: [Q]uit thinking about decent land-use as solely an economic problem. Examine each question in terms of what is ethically and aesthetically right, as well as what is economically expedi ent. A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.27 The ethic was initially scorned by philosophers. John Passmore, one of the first philosophers to ride the momentum of Earth Day 1970 to the pub lisher's with his 1974 volume Man's Responsibility for Nature, simply dismissed it; his countryman H. J. McCloskey called it "a retrogression to a morality of a kind held by various primitive peoples."28,29 J. Baird Call icott, Aldo Leopold's greatest exponent and interpreter, credits this misun derstanding to three very simple characteristics of the land ethic: it is "abbreviated, unfamiliar, and radical."30 He proceeds to spell out its logic, tie it back into the philosophical tradition, and support its radical implica tions, in an argument we trace briefly. The logic begins with two simple observations: First, moral obligation of some kind is universally acknowledged across the human race, for good evolutionary reasons. (Natural selection would predict that, had there been any human groups initially without such acknowledgement, they would have perished from the face of the earth.) Therefore we need not ask, why we ought to be moral, any more than we need to ask why we ought to have capillaries or external ears. Given the kind of creature we turn out to be, we could hardly be otherwise. (Callicott combines the accounts of human morality given by Charles Darwin, Edward O. Wilson, Adam Smith and David Hume to reach that conclusion; he might have added the more recent account given by Robert Wright in The Moral Animal.)31 The second observation is that whatever the level of moral practice may be, here or elsewhere, the level of moral consciousness has risen slowly and inevitably from the dawn of human awareness, or at least from the time that Odysseus hanged the slave girls from a single rope (the incident that begins Aldo Leopold's account of the Land Ethic). The recognition of "moral consider ability," of worthiness to have one's rights (however defined) and interests</page><page sequence="22">30 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal taken into account, spreads from the initial instinctive focus on the immediate family clan to the tribe, to the community, to the society as a whole, to nonhumans, always proceeding by analogy with the last group deemed to be morally considerable.32 Worthy of note is the fact that many tribal groups recognize nonhumans?animals, trees, even rocks and moun tains?as "persons" long before they recognize as such the humans living in the next valley. Nothing in the human fabric, whatever the doctrinal strictures of theology and theologically oriented philosophers, prevents humans from conceiving of and honoring moral obligations to the rest of creation, obligations to the land. In that sense at least, the land ethic is neither unfamiliar nor radical. We started our existence as a species in the heart of a biotic commu nity, not as lord over it but as "plain member and citizen of it," in Leopold's words.33 All the evidence suggests that for most of our existence?all except the last 6000 years of it, in European reckoning, and considerably less than that for most of the human race?we acknowledged as part of ourselves the nonhuman neighbors and companions that made that life possible. In civilization?"cityfication," as Callicott translates it?we draw back from the nature with which we lived, we leave the animals with which we have evolved outside the city walls, and withdraw to an artificial environment inhabited primarily by other human beings. In company with the anthropomorphic gods and goddesses that emerge in the first myths of civilization, it becomes much easier to assume that all worth is contained in the human form. We now see ourselves as somehow "transcendent," distinctly different from all other animals, and our myths, stories, and moral systems begin to change to contain this new assumption of superiority. Historically, the mythmakers, writers, storytellers, cosmologists and theo logians have worked in the cities. In a self-reinforcing circle, our "science" increasingly paints nature?non-human nature?as inferior, non-rational, a lesser order of being clearly fit to be dominated by us, and our "theology," our account of gods and goddesses, increasingly paints us as created by them to rule nature for our own purposes. Leopold homed in on the notion of "community" to describe the natural world of which we form a part, specifically rejecting (after a period of trying it out)34 the notion of Nature as one huge all-encompassing (and dominating) organism. The community is essentially a passage of energy in which all participants cooperate:</page><page sequence="23">The Forms and Limits of Economic Environmentalism 31 Land, then, is not merely soil; it is a fountain of energy flowing through a circuit of soils, plants and animals. Food chains are the living channels which conduct energy upward; death and decay return it to the soil. The circuit is not closed;.. .but it is a sustained circuit, like a slowly augmented revolving fund of life.35 This process augments itself in evolution, a trend over very long periods of time to increase the diversity of the biota. Since that process is the core of what is good in nature, it is our duty to maintain that diversity. Our position as "plain member and citizen" of the community of the living world requires that we treat our fellow citizens with respect and appreciation, and conservation of biodiversity is only one of the obvious steps to take. The integrity?and the beauty?of the process that is the soil, as described above, provides the needed "intrinsic" or "inherent" value of nature (as opposed to the merely instrumental value of commodiflable resources or recreational opportunities). From this vast process, from which we draw and in which we participate, we derive the duty of respect, fulfilled in the avoidance of damage and the effort to restore the process where its integrity has been lost?in short, all the activities of environmental con servation. Coda Why the Outrageous Young Men Were Right Let us return to the current controversy, the infuriating suggestion that "environmentalism" ought to be abandoned in favor of more contemporary causes. Of course the young men are right, that "environment" is not, or is not any longer, the kind of buzz word that will attract "liberal" votes. Insofar as liberalism entails nothing but individual freedom?civil liberties in the public square, equal justice for all, but also the rights to play the market for all its worth, the right to consume anything you can buy, and the right to feel good about it as long as you are not hurting anyone else?anyone else visible and near?environmentalism is profoundly anti liberal. That's not a fact that makes us feel very good, but it's a fact nonetheless. On the other hand, maybe we should feel good about it. "Liberalism" has not been of lasting help to the land. Contemporary "conservatism," of course, is even less help, having been monopolized by neo-liberals,</page><page sequence="24">32 Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal sectarian theocrats and nativists. But it would seem that the ultimate initiative for the land is coming from the real conservatives, those who are recapturing the skills of organic farming on small and medium plots, selling fresh food to local markets, limiting reliance on long-distance (fuel-consum ing) transportation, while rediscovering the pleasures of working together with neighbors on simple tasks that provide a sufficient life. The young men were right. Environmentalism cannot, and should not, recapture liber alism, let alone "progressivism." If we can recapture conservatism?a revival of classical conservatism and the defense of the commons?that political philosophy will furnish the best home for "environmentalism" (although we may learn to call it something else). But the point of this paper, besides a vindication of the young men, is an expansion of the grounds on which we recognize acts as environmentally sound. We may seek support for environmental measures completely outside the political framework, in the economic world preferred by business. In the end, there is not only one set of teachings for the environmentalists?on the contrary, the defense of the land will appear in dozens of guises at many levels of public discourse. Notes 1.
