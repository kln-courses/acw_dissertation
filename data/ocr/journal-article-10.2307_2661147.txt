<plain_text><page sequence="1">RETHINKING ANIMISM: THOUGHTS FROM THE INFANCY OF OUR DISCIPLINE MARTIN D. STRINGER University of Birmingham Here I look at E.B. Tylor's classic work Primitive culture, particularly that aspect that deals with animism. I discuss several of the critiques of animism, showing how most of them have actually misread Tylor's original intentions in relation to his supposed 'theory of origins' and his understanding of 'spirit', among other things. Then, by focusing on Tylor's theory of myth and the process by which he constructs his argument concerning animism, I provide a re-reading that focuses on discourse and layers of religious practice within individual societies. Finally, I indicate how this re-reading of Tylor relates to contemporary writing on animism and modern religions. Last spring I decided to read the two volumes of E.B. Tylor's classic Primitive culture (1871). Much to my surprise, I found myself reading a very sensitive, sophisticated, intellectually complex text written by a scholar whose ideas seemed to bear very little relation to my popular conception of his writing. This led me to look at Tylor's other writing (Tylor 1866; 1870; 1881; 1892) and at the development of the critical literature surrounding his work. My own particular interest relates to Tylor's theories of religion, in particular his emphasis on 'animism'. I was not convinced that this concept could be dismissed quite as readily as many subsequent writers have suggested. Here I have chosen to concentrate on this particular strand of Tylor's thought. I will begin by looking at the different layers of criticism aimed at the concept of animism within the anthropological literature; then I will look at what Tylor's wider work on religion might have to offer to the contemporary scholar. Meeting the criticism When we come to look at the critique of Tylor's work on animism, we find that it comes in various layers. The first layer concerns the more general criticism of Tylor's thought on culture, evolution and survivals. None of these touches directly on the question of animism. All of them, however, define Tylor's wider thought, and an attack on Tylor's understanding of evolution, for example, would make a clear difference to the way in which we understand his ideas about the development of animism through the different stages of culture. We cannot, therefore, ignore Tylor's evolutionism, his patronizing primi- tivism, his idea of culture or his theory of survivals. These are the things people J. Roy. anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 5, 541-556</page><page sequence="2">542 MARTIN D. STRINGER remember him for. We can, however, acknowledge that all these things are a product of his context as a writer on social phenomena late in the nineteenth century, and that at least three of them play only a very minor part in his writing on religion. Tylor works within an evolutionary framework. He talks constantly about 'progress', he associates 'primitives' or 'savages' with 'children', and he has a basic understanding of time being mapped geographically onto the known societies of the world (cf Fabian 1983). He is not, however, a great supporter of the contemporary status quo: he ends the book by saying that 'the science of culture is essentially a reformers' science' (1871: II, 410). Tylor is far more sympathetic to the 'savages' he discusses (and far more critical of other ethnographers, and even the colonial context) than many of his contem- poraries (cf Lienhardt 1969: 85). He refuses to speculate about a pre-savage, 'animalistic', state. He is keen to emphasize that the human mind is the same throughout the world irrespective of the stage of social evolution reached by any one society. In his discussion of language, for example, he maintains that, in terms of complexity, there is nothing to distinguish the language of the savage from that of civilized societies, except for a more specialized vocabulary. The principal distinction, for Tylor, appears to be one of education, which he equates with progress in many different ways.' Education, therefore, is Tylor's model for social evolution, the acquiring of knowledge and of ever more sophisticated ways of dealing with that knowledge by humanity as a whole. As Ingold (1986: 94) says, Tylor 'regarded the mind [not of the 'individual' but of 'mankind' (Ingold 1986: 47)] as an active and creative movement, endlessly borne along by gener- ation after generation of individuals'. It is for this reason that the science of culture is a reformer's science. It is forward-looking and potentially revolu- tionary. This brings us to the subject of culture. Tylor borrowed the term 'from his readings in German "culture-history"' (Lienhardt 1969: 88). It is Tylor's own re- definition of the term, however, which is most often quoted at the beginning of modern discussions. Tylor uses the term 'culture' primarily to avoid a discussion of race (1871: I, 6). There is, however, no clear sense of what this concept contains. Tylor's own list of 'capabilities and habits' which opens Primitive culture is purely exemplary and could be expanded indefinitely (1871: I, 1). Ingold (1986: 34 sqq.) notes that Tylor always uses the concept of culture in the singular and that he must, therefore, be talking about the culture of humanity as a whole; a single cable made up of many different strands which unites the whole history and development of the race. There is certainly strong evidence for this holistic view. However, we must also acknowledge that Tylor uses 'culture' as the basis for his comparative analysis. While those things that are compared are essentially the distinct strands of Ingold's culture, at different places along the cable, each society is also seen as being a distinct whole with a culture of its own. Ingold claims that Lowie distorted Tylor's holistic view of 'culture', and introduces the concept of 'cultures' (1986: 46). I would argue, however, that, in practical appli- cation at least, this understanding of cultures is already present in Tylor's work. Finally, therefore, we have 'survivals'. This is the concept that will be forever linked with Tylor's name. Survivals are the consequence of a logical line of thought from evolution, and Tylor's particular understanding of culture. If culture is a unified whole that is progressing at a regular pace, then those elements which appear in 'later' cultures but which should not, by other criteria,</page><page sequence="3">MARTIN D. STRINGER 543 be there, can be defined as 'survivals'. Survivals, however, are not simply a logically necessary element of the wider framework; they are also an integral part of the analysis. It is through survivals, Tylor suggests (but does not actually develop), that we can see what was going on at an earlier stage in the process. It is in these terms that folklorists (and others, including modern pagans) have taken up and used the concept, treating Tylor in the process as something like a 'household god' (Dorson 1968: 196).2 A 'theory of origins'? Having put these wider issues to one side, we can now come to the second layer of criticism, the theory of animism in itself The first question to clear up concerns the commonly quoted assertion that Tylor coined the term 'animism'. This is not strictly true. Animism is not the term that Tylor himself would have chosen. He preferred 'spiritualism', but this was already being used to define a particular religious group, for whom Tylor had very little sympathy (1871: I, 385). Tylor comments that 'Animism is not a new technical term' and a footnote explains that 'the term has been especially used to denote the doctrine of Stahl. The Animism of Stahl is a revival and development in modern scientific shape of the classic theory identifying vital principle and soul' (1871: I, 384-5).3 Animism', therefore, does have some appeal to Tylor, especially in its connexion with the soul. The understanding of spiritualism, however, is always hovering in the background and Tylor argues that animism must be seen to be divided into 'two great dogmas, forming parts of one consistent doctrine', the belief in souls and the belief in spirits (1871: I, 385). As we shall see, this double identity and the confusions that it can create have led to a number of serious misreadings of Tylor's work. Before we come to look at the precise content that Tylor gives to 'animism', we need to explore a preliminary question, that of origins. Every writer, from Lang and Marett to contemporary commentators, assumes that the core of Tylor's writing on animism is a 'theory of origins'.4 It is this supposed 'theory of origins' which is then subject to criticism, primarily through a discussion of its logical coherency. The question we need to ask, however, is whether animism and the linking of souls to the experience of dreams, as seen by Tylor, is a 'theory of origins' in any but the loosest of senses. To do this we need to take a step back and look at the internal logic of Tylor's argument, and then compare this to the supposed logic of the arguments that are criticized by subsequent writers. In order to do this I want to look briefly at Lowie's discussion of Durkheim's critique of the 'theory of origins' (1936: 108-14). In The elementaryforms of religious life, Durkheim picks up the link that Tylor makes between dreams and the concept of the soul. He states that 'to have been able to thrust itself upon men with a kind of necessity, this idea would have to have been the only possible hypothesis, or at least the simplest' (1995: 53). Durkheim then goes on to explore other, 'simpler' explanations of dreams, and dreams for which the 'idea of double' would not be valid. In doing this, Lowie suggests, 'Durkheim misses the point of departure for Tylor's investigation by ... inverting the problem' (1936: 111). 'The question', Lowie argues, 'is not to show how the savage might in simple fashion explain his dream life but how the empirically noted idea of a double could arise' (1936: 111). In other words, Tylor is beginningwith empirical</page><page sequence="4">544 MARTIN D. STRINGER data and looking for some plausible explanation of these data, while Durkheim is assuming that Tylor is building a hypothesis out of first principles through a logical development from dreams to souls. To put this another way, following Skorupski's (1976: 21) discussion of Leach's criticism of Neo-Tylorianism, irrational beliefs cannot be presented as rational, but it is possible 'to explain irrational beliefs rationally'. All those who attempt to criticize Tylor's animism as a 'theory of origins' face this problem in one form or another. Evans-Pritchard, for example, falls into exactly the same trap in his own summary of Tylor's supposed 'theory of origins'. 'Primitive man's reflection on such experiences as death, disease, trances, visions, and above all dreams', Evans- Pritchard claims, 'led him to the conclusion that they are to be accounted for by the presence or absence of some immaterial entity, the soul' (1965: 25). Here, again, the direction of the theory is presented as if it were a logical deduction from 'death, disease, trances, visions and ... dreams' to 'the soul' on the part of 'primitive man'. This leads directly to Evans-Pritchard's famous critique: 'The theory has the quality of ajust-so story like "how the leopard got its spots"' (1965: 25), or as he says of Spencer, 'it is a fine example of the introspectionist psychol- ogist's, or "if I were a horse", fallacy' (1965: 24). For Tylor himself, however, it is no such thing. He has a mass of data about the existence of the soul, which he goes to some length to prove is universal in human culture. He then looks for some means by which this concept of a soul could be explained in a rational fashion (1871: I, 380). Dreams, trances, visions and the like offer one possible way of doing this. As Lewis says, 'Tylor's interpretation is, up to point, good horse sense' (1986: 15). In no sense, however, is Tylor constructing a 'theory of origins'. Even if we grant that Tylor is not constructing a 'theory' of origins, we still have to acknowledge that he is offering a 'plausible explanation' in terms of origins. This, however, is probably to take his words too literally. Tylor, like many of his critics, goes to some lengths to explain that we could never discover the true origins of any religious idea; such origins come from a period of human history to which we have no possible access (cf Marett 1914: 7). Any theory of origins, therefore, is bound to be guesswork and should always be treated as such. What Tylor was looking for was not 'origins' in this definitive sense, but rather a reasonable explanation for the 'facts' that he lays out at such great length. The dream theory offered one possible, and very plausible, explanation. This is reinforced by the passage from the second edition of Primitive culture that is quoted by Lessa and Vogt in their Reader in comparative religion (1979). Having given the 'theory of origins' explanation for the passage in their introduction, the editors then provide the classic passage from Chapter 11, the most important section of which reads: It seems as though thinking men, as yet at a low level of culture, were deeply impressed by two groups of biological problems. In the first place, what is it that makes the difference between a living body and a dead one; what causes waking, sleep, trance, disease, death? In the second place, what are those human shapes which appear in dreams and visions? Looking at these two groups of phenomena, the ancient savage philosophers probably made their first step by the obvious inference that every man has two things belonging to him, namely, a life and a phantom (Lessa &amp; Vogt 1979: 11-12, emphasis added).5 The words 'it seems as though' and 'probably' give a very different feel to this passage from the bold statement of the 'theory of origins' as presented by Tylor's critics.</page><page sequence="5">MARTIN D. STRINGER 545 The same argument can, in principle, be used to discuss the second half of Tylor's supposed theory, that of the development of the idea of the soul-spirit through the different layers of culture. The principal criticism of this theory which is offered is that there is no mechanism in Tylor's work by which the idea of a soul can be transformed into that of an ancestor, for example, or how the idea of an ancestor can develop into the idea of a god, and so on. What is being presented is essentially a descriptive account. This leads Tambiah to state that 'the scheme ... has only an illusory magnificence, without hinges to support the edifice' (1990: 48). Again, this criticism misunderstands what Tylor is trying to do. For Tylor, the theory is descriptive. 'What matters is the fact that all the different elements of religious belief, at all levels of culture, are of the same kind, each being suggested by the other but without any necessary causal connexion between them. 'All that is hypothesised ... is the sequence in which they are supposed to have arisen one out of another' (1866: I, 85). What matters for Tylor, therefore, is that the same thought process underlies the whole edifice, and his primary interest is in the thought process rather than the edifice itself 'Animism in Tylor's account', says Byrne, 'is the key to understanding the manifold beliefs and practices now extant and is the hidden unity beneath that manifold' (1991: 17). Animism, souls and spiritual beings Tylor's work on animism, therefore, is not a theory of origins. It is a 'plausible explanation' that most early commentators appeared to accept in those terms (Morris 1987: 101). There is, however, one further question related to animism that still needs to be explored. This forms the basis for the third layer of criticism which Tylor faces, and is concerned with the actual content of the thesis: what exactly is this 'soul' that is being talked about? Alternatively, taking Tylor's minimum definition of religion, the 'belief in Spiritual Beings' (1871: I, 383), what does Tylor mean by 'Spiritual Beings', or even by 'belief'? Tylor himself is notoriously vague on these kinds of questions and, I argue, deliberately so (1871: I, 383). Other writers, however, want to nail him down, and want to be far more precise in their own definitions. In the same way that writers constructed a 'theory of origins' out of Tylor's 'plausible explanation' and then proceeded to critique it, so the same writers define what they mean by 'soul' or 'spiritual beings' and then proceed to critique this secondary definition. Lowie, for example, uses an unspecified dictionary to define 'spiritual' (1936: 99). Durkheim follows his statement of Tylor's definition with the qualifier, "'Spiritual beings" must be understood to mean conscious subjects that have capacities superior to those of ordinary men' (1995: 27). Tylor never offers anything like a clear definition, and while he talks at times of'phantoms', at other times of 'spirits', of souls that are 'vaporous and immaterial' and so on, he never actually offers one master definition. The definition of the concept must, like that of culture, be derived from the use to which he puts it, and in this sense it must cover everything from the basic soul to the highest of High Gods. Whatever this 'spiritual' thing is, it is that which all these entities have in common. By ignoring the vagueness of the terminology in Tylor's work, various authors have offered criticisms that in many cases Tylor has already dealt with. Durkheim, for example, raises the problem of Buddhism and Jainism, as being</page><page sequence="6">546 MARTIN D. STRINGER religions without 'spiritual beings'. This is despite the fact that Tylor recognizes the problem and deals with it succinctly. Durkheim does not include the concept of the human soul within his particular definition of spiritual beings. Tylor clearly does, and Buddhism could not function without an understanding of the transmigration of souls (Tylor 1871: II, 10). Lowie raises what might be defined as the opposite problem, that of dwarfs. These, Lowie argues, are not spiritual at all, but decidedly material. Among the Crow, for example, the dwarf 'has all the earmarks of robust non-natural anthropomorphism, he belongs as it were to a distinct and powerful, though stunted, branch of the family Hominidae, localised near Pryor Creek' (1936: 123). Tylor's comment on this would be twofold. First, he would probably place such dwarfs alongside giants as the result of so-called 'myths of observation', a process of explaining the presence of large (or small) fossil bones and therefore a part of the supposed natural environment and not an element of religion at all (1870: 313 sqq.). Or, if dwarfs are treated as the focus for religious devotion, then Tylor would stress the 'non-natural' element of Lowie's definition and equate this with the spirit-soul while playing down the 'thin unsubstantial image' which Lowie quotes from Tylor to define the 'spiritual'. This raises the question of what value concepts such as the 'spiritual' or the 'soul' have if they can mean whatever Tylor wants them to mean at any particular time. In answering this we need to acknowledge another aspect of the thesis, that animism is seen by Tylor as a 'primitive philosophy', a prerequisite for religion, and not as a religion in itself. Some authors clearly use this distinction as the basis for their own critique, arguing that if animism is not a religion then we should not treat it as a religion and consequently that it has no value to the student of religion. This is not very helpful. To define animism as a religion is to place the emphasis once again on the focus for that religion, that is spirits and souls, and this brings us straight back to the definitional problem. To treat it simply as a way of thinking, as a primitive philosophy, is to make the definitional problem irrel- evant. VWhat is important for Tylor is that people think in terms of entities that are beyond empirical study (for which Tylor uses the shorthand of 'Spiritual Beings') and subsequently modify their behaviour in such a way as to take these non- empirical entities into account.6 The exact form of such non-empirical entities is irrelevant to the mode of thought, although essential to the understanding of any particular case. VWhat is important is that they exist for the thinker. The problem Tylor has is the age-old problem of talking about these entities, and related phenomena, in a religiously neutral way. Tylor does not try to do this very consis- tently, which is unfortunate. He tends to solve the problem through an excess of terminology and a subsequent confusion of terms, while others have tried to be more precise. However, as Klass (1995) has shown, the question of definitions will never go away entirely. Another, related, question picks up from this point. If animism is essentially a mode of thought that accepts the existence of non-empirical entities, of whatever kind, and seeks to act accordingly, does this not put 'belief' and the intellectual faculty at the heart of religion? 'What happens, Marett asks, if religion is not concerned with thought or belief at all, but is founded on a vague notion of pre- animistic awe? 'What happens, according to Robertson-Smith, if religion is essen- tially about ritual action, and that any thought about such action can only provide a post-hoc justification for that action? 'What happens, in Marett's words, if</page><page sequence="7">MARTIN D. STRINGER 547 religion 'is something not so much thought out as danced out' (1914: xxxi)? This is a tricky question and one that has dominated discussions within the anthro- pology of religion from Tylor, Robertson-Smith, Marett and so on to the present day. What these questions represent are three distinct theories of religion - intel- lectual, emotional or ritual - and it will depend on which theory writers hold as to which they will pursue. In reality, all religious activity involves all three elements, but even to say this only raises the question of priority. There is no obvious answer to this except to say that whatever answer we come to we must not, as anthropology has tended to do, stress any one element at the expense of the others. Anthropology still needs an adequate theory of belief, and with his emphasis on thought processes, Tylor, I suggest, might offer us one possibility for developing such a theory. The final criticism that I wish to deal with in this section is Lang's. For much of his The making of religion (1898), Lang emphasizes the importance of trances, hallucinations and other extra-sensory perceptions in reinforcing Tylor's supposed 'theory of origins'. He argues that there should be more 'scientific' study of such phenomena, and that the possible 'truth' of such experiences must always be acknowledged (1898: 121). In the rest of the book, Lang argues a different case. Here the question is one of chronology. Was the 'soul' the first stage in the development of religion, and did the concept of the soul lead to that of ghosts, ghosts to ancestors, ancestors to gods, and gods to God? The first question concerns the definitional problem that I have already discussed; are gods of the same 'kind' as other spiritual beings, particularly souls (Lang 1898: 176)? As we have seen, Tylor would claim that they are. The second criticism concerns the supposed fact, as stated by Lang, that moralistic High Gods are found even among the most primitive of tribes and should therefore be seen as being as 'original' as souls. Lang claims to provide 'conclusive' evidence for High Gods among primitive tribes (1898: 177 sqq.). Tylor does not dismiss this evidence entirely, but he does raise a number of questions about the nature and origin of these High Gods among primitive tribes that Lang tries to challenge. Tylor questions, for example, the implied 'morality' of these High Gods, which for him is a product of higher levels of culture. He also asks whether such High Gods might not have derived from missionaries and other Western travellers rather than being intrinsic to the primitive tribe itself Lang argues that the primitive High Gods pre-date the missionaries and he provides evidence to 'prove' it. He appears to be unaware, however, of a paper given to the Anthropological Institute by Tylor and published in theirJournal of 1892. This paper consists of a very detailed reading of a number of cases for primitive High Gods among American Indian and Aboriginal peoples. Through a careful analysis of the sources, and an awareness of the comparative chronology of these texts, Tylor shows that, at least in the cases quoted, High Gods are the product either of Western travellers reading their own ideas into the thoughts of the locals, or of direct influence from missionaries and others. 'The historical evidence that the Great Spirit belongs not to the untutored but to the tutored mind of the savage', Tylor claims, 'is preserved for us in the records of the tutors themselves, the Jesuit missionaries in Canada' (1892: 284). This is a very tightly argued paper which, while not being conclusive (it does not deal with the African High Gods for example), is dealing with historical time (and not the evolu- tionist's time scale of primitive v. civilized) and is dealing with actual records and</page><page sequence="8">548 MARTIN D. STRINGER first-hand accounts. This kind of very close reading of the texts should go a long way to challenge many of our own prejudices about the lack of adequate data available to nineteenth-century writers, and Tylor's paper should be much more widely known. Apart from anything else, its presence means that we need to go back and review Lang's own evidence very carefully indeed.7 A process of reconstruction Having removed some of the red herrings in Tylor's argument we now need to ask what theory of religion he is presenting. The first point is to restate that this is not, as almost every writer seems to suggest, a 'theory of origins'. Tylor is not interested in how religion originated. What he is interested in is the more general question of why so many people around the world appear to believe in things which do not make immediate rational sense to the Victorian scientific mind. It is the logic by which religion works which is of primary concern for Tylor. In the remainder of this article, therefore, I want to highlight two aspects of Tylor's work that I feel could form the basis for a reconstruction of 'animism'. The first area that I wish to highlight is that of myth. No anthropologist that I have read has ever commented on Tylor's theory of mythology, although it was taken up, developed and criticized by folklorists (Dorson 1968: 187 sqq.). The theory of myth, however, underlies Tylor's understanding of animism, and, given Tylor's own tendency to begin his arguments with a discussion of language, it is arguable that a right understanding of myth is, for Tylor, necessary for a right understanding of religion. As with many other elements of his work, Tylor does not define myth too narrowly. Dorson comments that Tylor 'placed mythical narratives on a spectrum running from the historically valid to the purely inventive' (1968: 188). Tylor, however, is not interested in the content of myths.' He argues that myths do have a meaning and a historical importance, but only as a record of beliefs and ideas from earlier stages of culture. It is the structure of the human mind that is revealed in myth, and this, for Tylor, can only be discovered through the comparative method.9 Myths, according to Tylor, begin with experience; that is, with nature and the animation of nature as held by those who believe (1871: I, 248). The sun and moon, for example, are generally seen as animate, as are stars, waterspouts, rainbows, disease, death and so on. This is not simply metaphor for Tylor. It is an a priori view of the world, 'a philosophy of the nature of things' (1866: 81). Tylor does accept MuAller's definition of myth as a 'disease of language', at least in part. He focuses, for example, on the role of gender in language, both in terms of male and female (as applied to inanimate objects) and in those languages where there is a further distinction between animate and inanimate genders (with sun, moon, stars, etc, being in the animate category). The process of categorization embedded in language (winter v. summer, night v. day, etc.) makes such person- ification not only possible but also plausible. Myth, however, is not derived from language (contra Muller): for Tylor the experience always comes first (1871: I, 271). Tylor argues that poets are best placed in contemporary society to understand primitive myth. The principles of both are much the same, particularly the way in which they each use and develop language. The only real distinction between the myth teller and the poet is that the former believes what he is recounting is</page><page sequence="9">MARTIN D. STRINGER 549 true and the latter knows it is metaphor (1866: 82). Tylor also talks about ecstasy and trance states as they relate to myth, and notes the important point that the person in an ecstatic state always sees what society has already defined as myth. Myth cannot, therefore, be based on the visions of the mystic (1871: I, 277). He stresses this point by emphasizing that it is the transmission of fantasy from person to person that makes the fantasy real and this, in its turn, enables society as a whole to 'see' the metaphor implicit in myth as real (1871: I, 277-8). o Myth, for Tylor, is a form of discourse, a way of talking about the world that aims to make sense of that world. Myth is only accessible to contemporary scholars because of poetry. For Tylor, therefore, the mid-nineteenth century was the best possible time to study religion. While there were still poets, scholars could at least grasp what was happening in myth. However, society had progressed far enough away from the mythic to see beyond the discourse and understand exactly what was going on (Tylor 1871: I, 286). Tylor is constantly stating that religion is framed within a mythic discourse (although he would not have used the word 'discourse'). What is more, he felt that it was necessary to discuss myth before talking about religion. He seems to be suggesting, therefore, that it is impossible to understand the language of the non-empirical without first moving into mythic discourse, which is that discourse which makes the presence of the non-empirical a reality. In doing this, Tylor is constructing religion as a discourse, a way of talking about the world in which different rules apply. This is common in contemporary thinking. We have got used to the idea. However, it is still interesting to see Tylor trying to struggle with the same idea over one hundred years ago.1' Tylor does not want to fall into the trap of Muller and say that religion is simply a 'disease of language'. Religion is not 'language' in a strict sense; it is 'discourse'. It is self- contained. It demands a switch of thought world, a switch which we still experience in poetry and which we can just about grasp, a switch which demands its own logic and its own rationality. Unfortunately for Tylor, he does not have the analytical tools available to explore this kind of discourse. It would have been fascinating to see what he might do with it if he could. Having looked at myth, I now wish to explore the better-known argument by which Tylor builds up, through a logical progression from simple ideas to issues that are increasingly complex, the structure of animism. Tambiah describes Tylor's 'scientific method' as 'the sorting of phenomena into "species"-like grouping, and then arranging these social species in levels or grades' (1990: 44). A number of authors have commented on the sheer number of facts quoted in Tylor's work. Lowie, for example, says that in 'turning from the psychological to the chronological aspects of Tylor's scheme, I must confess that it is not in all details perfectly clear to me, for the overwhelming mass of concrete illustrations is leavened by a minimum of logical correlation' (1936: 118). Jordan complains that Tylor's argument is actually too complex to be true to nature (1905: 263). I would argue, however, that it is this very complexity, this overwhelming mass of concrete illustration, which allows us to rework Tylor's material in a new and interesting fashion. At first sight, Tylor's argument looks to be an evolutionary process, and Tylor clearly understands it in this way. Each chapter, for example, or each argument within a chapter, begins with simple instances of a phenomenon, illustrated primarily by examples from 'savage societies'. Tylor then shows how the same</page><page sequence="10">550 MARTIN D. STRINGER principle develops through different layers to more complex forms, with illus- trations of the higher or more complex phenomena taken primarily from civilized societies. The whole structure is developmental and is mapped onto a pre-conceived evolutionary model. One element of all these arguments, however, undermines their evolutionary framework and this needs to be explored in more detail. While Tylor generally uses examples from savage societies in the earlier stages of his arguments, and examples from civilized societies in the later stages, his insistence on providing an excess of data cannot help highlighting anomalies. So we find, for example, that ghosts are found in civilized societies (usually seen by the uneducated, although not always, as with Spiritualists and others) and that the idea of a High God is present in many of the so-called savage societies of the world (with the provisos that I have already explained above). In other words, while the form of the argument may suggest an evolutionary framework, the facts that he is presenting, the concrete illustrations, are clearly undermining the central principles of this framework. For every phenomenon on these developing progressions there are examples from primitive societies, there are examples from barbarian societies and there are examples from civilized and modern societies. The primary emphasis in each society may be on one particular element, whether ancestor worship, polytheism, nature spirits or whatever. What is clear, however, is that all the other kinds of phenomena also appear to be present in the same society, even if they only exist in sub-sections of the society or at different levels of the same society, such as between the family and the wider political system. In late Victorian Britain, the main emphasis may be on monotheistic ethical religion, but ancestor-worship and polytheistic gods are also found in, for example, the cults of the saints. Some people believe in ghosts and local nature spirits, and healing is understood in certain parts of the country as the departing of a spirit from the body.12 All these religious elements exist together in some kind of complex, if not very coherent, whole. However, by taking each element one at a time and by exploring some kind of supposed progression between them, Tylor fails entirely to notice the form of the complex whole that he is actually describing. This is just as true of many of Tylor's so-called savage societies as it is for Victorian Britain. There may be ancestor cults, spirit beings, fetishes and High Gods all existing simultaneously in the account, but unconnected in any continuous description. Tylor, however, cannot be blamed entirely for failing to recognize this basic principle. Very few anthropologists have ever fully acknowledged such facts. Evans-Pritchard, for example, attempted to make sense of this same complexity in his famous study of Nuer religion (1976). In order to do this, however, he had to develop the spurious theological notion of 'refraction' that allowed him to contain all the different levels of Nuer religion, from fetishes and local nature spirits, through the spirits of the below and the spirits of the above, up to Kwoth, the High God who is beyond contact and comprehension, in one theoretical frame. What becomes clear, however, if Tylor's work is read in a non-chrono- logical fashion, is that all these levels exist simultaneously throughout the world. However, in no specific situation (even, we must assume, that of the Nuer) are these different levels adequately integrated into some kind of religious whole. If we relate what Tylor was saying about myth to the kind of argument that I</page><page sequence="11">MARTIN D. STRINGER 551 have just presented, then it becomes clear not only that there are different layers of religion within any one social context, but that these represent different layers of religious discourse. These discourses may be cross-cutting and contradictory, they are probably situational (that is they serve the purpose of the moment; Stringer 1996), but we should not expect them to come together into one distinct 'religious' discourse. All that finally relates these discourses is that they concern that which is 'spiritual', that which is 'non-empirical'. They share the thought processes of 'animism'. This may well undermine the very notion of 'religion', but it does, I think, express the real situation far more satisfactorily than many of the theories that we have been developing, and it needs to be explored further through ethnographic study. Conclusion By way of conclusion, I wish to reflect on the way in which this reinterpretation of the work of Tylor has any relevance for the contemporary study of religion with anthropology. The first and most obvious place to look would be in recent writing on the nature of animism. While those who work within comparative religion have maintained the term as a designation for a particular kind of religion, anthropologists, until very recently, have largely ignored the term itself This is presumably because of its associations with 'primitivism', which comes directly from the critical discussion of Tylor's works. Fairly recently, however, various books and articles have been written which have attempted to rehabilitate the term, ostensibly by going back to its roots, that is by turning back to Tylor. Each of these attempts has picked up certain elements of the concept without really engaging with the full complexity and ambiguity that I have shown to surround Tylor's own thinking. Guthrie (1993), for example, simply picks up the idea that animism is thought to be the process of giving personality to non-human objects and talks in terms of anthropomor- phism. This, Guthrie argues, sits at the heart of all religion. There are two funda- mental mistakes in this analysis, however, when seen from a Tylorian perspective. First, the assumption that animism can be reduced only to those non-empirical entities that appear to have personality or other 'human' attributes cannot be supported by Tylor's writings. As part of his complex classification of non- empirical entities that could be covered by the basic thought process underlying animism, Tylor would also want to include entirely impersonal forces, such as those associated with fetishes. While Guthrie may argue that to relate to anything as if it contained some kind of force is to anthropomorphize it, I think that this tends to stretch the point too far. Secondly, Guthrie is explicitly trying to construct a theory of origins (1993: 62 sqq.). His theory of origins is different, even from that imputed to Tylor, but it suffers from exactly the same kind of 'if I were a horse' nature that Tylor's theory is supposed to have. In other words, all the critiques which have traditionally been thrown at Tylor can easily be redirected at Guthrie and, what is more, they can probably stick. A more sophisticated form of a very similar argument is found in a recent paper by Bird-David (1999). Bird-David does not attempt in any way to account for the origins of religion. Her concern is entirely with the ethnographic reality of a number of villages in southern India. In this sense her work is more of an application of the theory of animism than it is a discussion of its nature. The</page><page sequence="12">552 MARTIN D. STRINGER paper, however, defines itself as a discussion of animism and much of it consists of a reassessment of Tylor's work. Unfortunately, Bird-David falls into many of the same traps as other critics of Tylor. She sees animism not so much as a religion as an approach to the world. The animistic approach, as represented by the people Bird-David studied, is based on the need to establish relationships beyond the human realm. Bird-David actually provides a very sophisticated and interesting discussion of the way in which relatedness is understood. She shows how this concept of relatedness easily can, and in some sense must, be seen to expand beyond the human realm to the natural and physical world. This is an excellent piece of ethnography and an interesting exploration of a particular religious expression, but the question still remains of how far this analysis relates to the discussion of animism, or even the wider discussion of religion, in Tylor. Once again, as with Guthrie but with far more subtlety, animism is understood primarily as a way of relating to the non-human world as if it were human (although with the emphasis here on the 'relating' rather than the 'as if it were human'). This is only a small part of Tylor's far wider conception, a part which might be important to the people being studied but does not engage with the full range of reflection on spirits, souls, fetishes, gods and the like, which are a part of Tylor's wider conception. The essential problem with the discussion of animism appears to be the problem which Tylor realized he might run into but could see no way of avoiding: the problem generated by the choice of words. 'Animism' speaks of the imputing of a soul (or a 'personality', or a 'relatedness') to that which empirically does not have one. This, as Guthrie (1993: 40) makes clear, is far more closely related to the psychologist's use of the term than it is to Tylor's. There may be some value in developing this narrow definition of animism and exploring the subtlety and sophistication of the different ways in which it can be expressed within different social groups. However, in doing this, anthropologists, including Guthrie and Bird-David, are not really engaging with Tylor, although they may be engaging with the image of Tylor created by his critics. Where, then, should we look for some contemporary applications of the kind of thinking that Tylor is advocating, especially in relation to the complexity of the different layers of discourse on the non-empirical which I have offered as the most significant element of Tylor's work? We might look at contemporary work in Western societies that focuses on phenomena such as the experience of angels or visitations from the dead or the use of crystals or ideas surrounding the concept of aliens and other beings from other planets and so on. In other words, we might turn to what is commonly referred to in the literature as the New Age. Much of the literature on the New Age aims to find some kind of order (conceptual, historical or in terms of practices) within the diversity of the New Age (e.g. Heelas 1996; York 1995). However, the very difficulty of providing any kind of definition of these phenomena means that the search for order may not be the most helpful approach. Reading Tylor's account non-synchronously, as I have tried to show, suggests that all human societies relate to the non-empirical at many different levels, in terms of personal souls, fetish-style forces, as spirits of many different kinds, as various forms of God. When the religious world is dominated by one tradition, such as Christianity, and this tradition attempts to suppress all unorthodox religious expression, then the different kinds of discourse represented by relics,</page><page sequence="13">MARTIN D. STRINGER 553 saints, angels, God and the like are difficult to see in isolation. When that domination is lifted, even partially, then other elements emerge and a wide variety of discourses, at many different levels of religious experience, begin to come into play. This is exactly what we are seeing within the New Age (and beyond, as many of those who talk about experiences of angels or the power of crystals would not claim to have any particular connexion to the New Age). It is here that we can see the application of Tylor's theory of animism. This is not some primitive religious expression, not anthropomorphism or relatedness, not some theory of origins, but simply the way in which ordinary people late in the twentieth century talk about that which is perceived to be non-empirical in their lives, whatever forms that non-empirical might actually take. Tylor was clearly constrained by his own times and by the thoughts of his contemporaries. He struggled to construct a new kind of argument. He could not do this entirely, and there is much in his work that we would want to reject today. However, if we acknowledge the struggle and look at what there is, both in and behind the text, then we can see so many later theories being developed in embryo, and can seejust how exciting Tylor actually was as a thinker. We can gain inspiration from his writing and look more critically at our ovn. We can think more carefully about the presuppositions and contexts that confine our ovn thinking. We can learn a great deal about writing comparative analysis and about synthesizing data into grand theories. We can learn the pitfalls, and perhaps we can learn some positive points. Grand theory, comparative analysis, interdisci- plinary study, is clearly coming back onto the agenda (cf Guthrie 1993). We have been there before. We have, perhaps, rejected the past and learned again for ourselves what we could have read in these books if only we took the time. Do not let us reinvent religion again in new theories. Rather, let us try to learn the lessons of the past and move on. Let us build on the work of Tylor and his contemporaries, as well as the thinkers of the hundred or so years in between, and develop new and exciting theories that begin to make sense of the facts, as we now understand them. Evans-Pritchard (1965: 100) states 'some of the books - those for example of Tylor, Frazer and Durkheim - will doubtless continue to be read as classics, but they are no longer much of a stimulus for the student'. In the case of Tylor, at least, I would beg to differ. NOTES This model of education is seen particularly in Tylor's discussion of 'gesture language' among the deaf He treats educated signers as being on a par with himself intellectually, and those who use crude gestures as being 'uneducated' rather than unintelligent (1870: 14 sqq.). 2 The concept of survivals is interesting primarily, I would suggest, because of the way in which the theory is misunderstood by so many commentators. Some writers appear to think that Tylor sees contemporary primitive societies as 'survivals', but this is not Tylor's understanding (see e.g. Bennett 1996: 35). Survivals, for Tylor, only occur in societies with a higher level of culture and are anomalous within that culture. It was also the emphasis on survivals that has led to what is perhaps the most offensive comment on Tylor in the whole of the anthropological literature, that of Douglas. Having first got his name wrong (calling him Henry) and then mistaking the date at which Primitive culture was first published (1873 rather than 1871), Douglas goes on to dismiss the idea of survivals: 'Whereas Tylor was interested in what quaint relics can tell us of the past, Robertson Smith was interested in the common elements in modern and primitive experience. Tylor founded folk-lore: Robertson Smith founded social anthropology' (1966: 14).</page><page sequence="14">554 MARTIN D. STRINGER 'As far as I can discover, Tylor first used the term 'animism' in an article in the Fortnightly Review in 1866, where he says 'the theory which endows the phenomena of nature with personal life might perhaps be conveniently called Animism' (1866: 82). It should be noted, however, that this use of Animism reflects Spencer's more general and literalistic use of the term rather than Tylor's more specific definition developed in Primitive culture. I This term is borrowed from Marett, who, in the preface to the second edition of his The threshold of religion, objects to his own ideas of awe and pre-animistic religious activity being referred to by critics as a 'theory of origins' (1914: viii). I This is taken from the second edition of 1873 and is noticeably vaguer and less certain than the first edition. In the first edition Tylor says: 'Looking at these two groups of phenomena, the ancient savage philosophers practically made each to help to account for the other, by combining both in a conception which we may call an apparitional-soul, a ghost soul' (1871: 387). Among other changes, the word 'probably' is missing. However, if Tylor chose to add 'probably' to the second edition then this must be significant. It is also interesting that Morris quotes the same passage from the same source, without explaining why, and yet fails to pick up on the 'probably' (1987: 100). 6 Scholars have used many different terms to define what I have called 'non-empirical'. Tylor uses 'spiritual'. Others have used 'supernatural', 'non-material' and, more recently, 'incorporeal' (Kiass 1995: 100). There is no adequate terminology. However, my term is based on the inability to provide empirical proof for such entities (beyond the language of those who talk about them). This is related to Sperber's 'symbolic knowledge', which involves statements which are, in his terms, 'false according to the state of the world' (Sperber 1975: 92), but which I would prefer to define as being empirically unprovable (the state of the world being unknown beyond the empiricism of scientific observation). 7 Despite the evidence of this article it is still noticeable that writers within Comparative Religion tend to take Lang's critique as definitive. This probably reflects their own (Christian- inspired) desire to maintain the centrality of the High God. Bennett (1996: 37), for example, uses Lang's argument concerning God in primitive society to state that 'anthropological evidence, then, would seem to demolish Tylor's theory of religion as untenable'. 8 Dorson, in The Britishfolklorists, argues that Tylor is too dependent on Muller's ideas of the 'solar myth'. Lang (1893) subsequently demolished the concept of the solar myth in his own writings but without directly criticizing Tylor. This led Tylor to tone down his own discussion of nature myths in the 3rd editions of both Primitive culture and Researches into the early history of mankind, which, in its turn, has probably led to the removal of myth as a topic from the later critique of Tylor's work. Both Lang and Dorson, however, seem to have focused solely on the content of Tylor's interpretation of myth (i.e. the association of mythic heroes with the sun, etc.), rather than on the mechanisms by which myth itself might work. They have, therefore, provided only a very superficial critique of his theory (Dorson 1968: 191). 9 Much of Tylor's work on myth clearly prefigures later structuralist accounts, both in their Proppian and in their Levi-Straussian forms. See, particularly, his discussion of life after death in chapter 13 of Primitive culture (1871: II, 40-98). 'O In Anthropology Tylor uses the following example: 'When a story-teller lives in this dreamland, any poetic fancy becomes a hint for a wonder-tale, and though (one would think) he must be aware that he is romancing, and that the adventures he relates are not quite history, yet when he is dead, and his story has been repeated by bards and priests for a few generations, then it would be disrespectful, or even sacrilegious, to question its truth' (1881: 392). There is something here which is very similar to Berger and Luckmann's (1966: 49 sqq.) process of objectivation. " This 'symbolic' or 'linguistic' element of Tylor's work is picked up by a number of his critics but is never developed. Skorupski, for example, says that Tylor is 'perhaps the earliest to have laid stress on belief in the power of symbols over what is symbolised' (1976: 129). Morris says that in his discussion of idols 'Tylor initiated a symbolic approach' (1987: 102). Lienhardt (1969: 89) argues that 'Tylor's still deeper concern with language, meaning, modes and thought and communication has in part lived on' in the recent writings of Turner and Levi-Strauss. None of them, however, goes on to explore the implications of this for contemporary anthropology. 12 Lang reinforces this view of late Victorian society by stressing the revival of hypnotism and clairvoyancy towards the end of the century, and adds his own comment on what was later to be called the 'primitive thought' debate by arguing that both savages and civilized men could see phantasms by the same induced methods; 'the civilised man,' Lang claims, 'beyond all doubt, is capable of being enfantisme ' (1898: 62).</page><page sequence="15">MARTIN D.
