In a linguistic frame of reference, what Chaucer or any writer  does with English does not collapse into English, and in the history of English  broadly conceived—English as a language that would grammatically transform  as it spanned the globe within two centuries of the poet’s death—Chaucer’s sig- nificance is arguably minimal.  As an account of the interplay between French and English literary culture, then,  Familiar Enemy is compelling; as an account of linguistic practice, it raises many  provocative issues. For example, while the book speaks of English and French  coming into contact with one another—“English had a competing relationship  with Anglo-French and continental French” (p. 118)—it is not languages but  speakers and perhaps domains that do so. From this view, language contact is less  an anthropomorphic struggle for cultural identity than a series of individuals’  strategic, pragmatic encounters. Instances of this kind of contact are therefore  not always or even often reflective of some larger cultural initiative but, as in the  Strasbourg Oaths, a need to respond to specific sociolinguistic circumstances. It is  this personal, pragmatic view that likewise disrupts the notion that it is “inherently  unlikely that there was very much practical and functional difference between  the two sides linguistically in the fourteenth century” (p. 169). However much  vocabulary and syntax they may share, languages (conventionally understood)  always remain distinct structural entities or it would be impossible for any one  speaker not only to evaluate the well-formedness of any utterance but also to  translate that utterance from one language into another. Conceptually, languages  retain their integrity precisely because—and so long as—speakers want them  to do so. Manuscript treatments of code-switching, the multilingual idiolect of  someone like Gower, the prevalence of macaronic sermons—all these point to the  stability of languages, including varieties of code-switching, within late-medieval  England’s linguistic repertoire. The book’s central claim is “that English needs  revaluing as a far less hard-edged object of study than modern dictionaries lead  us to believe” (p. xxiv). Yet modern dictionaries, in their dialectal, historical, and  national versions, would seem to point to anything but a hard-edged object, even  as the success of communication, modern as well as medieval, points to speakers’  awareness of the practical integrity of the languages they speak.  This is an important book that invites active engagement with its challenging  material. Its general arguments about the interrelations of French and English  literature are cogent and thought-provoking, as are its meditations on what we  mean by nationalism and why it matters. Familiar Enemy will quickly become a  touchstone of future arguments on literature and culture at the end of the English  Middle Ages.

Over the past 25 years, Peter Travis has written some of the most significant essays  on the Nun’s Priest’s Tale. Now he has compiled them into a framed collection,  Disseminal Chaucer: Rereading the Nun’s Priest’s Tale. The book’s eight chapters repro- duce eight essays published between 1986 and 2005 that are worked together into  one of the most detailed monographs on a single story from The Canterbury Tales.

Speaking of our criti- cal ambitions to interpret the tale, to make it give up its meaning, Travis believes  “that one of its major commitments is to demonstrate, not only its own resistance,  but the adamantine resistance of all literature to traditional critical practices”  (p. 4). This claim to literary resistance thus gives continued power to literature  to resist the ways we would seek to read it, even perhaps when that desired read- ing produces a politically resistant text. Guiding his logic throughout is “a fully  theorized understanding of parody” that provides his “principal concept” (p. 8).  Even from his introduction and the critical revision that it offers, we can see that  the Nun’s Priest’s Tale is an important fulcrum for Chaucerians as well as why it  has sustained Travis’s interest for so long. In this supposedly simple animal story,  a genre used by moralists to educate the illiterate and the young, Chaucer’s very  identity as a sophisticated secular and “modern” poet is most crucially at stake.  How we read the Nun’s Priest’s Tale indexes how we read Chaucer more generally  and what can be done with his “medieval” literary works, and thus sets the stakes  for the status of medieval literature in our own classrooms.  For these reasons, then, Travis refers equally to the rhetorical treatises, classical  models, and schoolroom exercises as he does to modern theory and contempo- rary social and cultural analyses (texts like Malcolm Gladwell’s Blink). The dual  direction makes for a kind of split consciousness in the book’s aims that is not  unsuccessful, but it will appear disorienting to some readers.  Given the book’s prior existence as separately published essays, it is perhaps  necessary to comment upon the success of the combination. This has partially  to do with whether one imagines a reader setting herself the entire book or if,  in these blog-induced days, we can only hope to attract readers (whose attention  span is limited by the length of a paragraph) with strong section titles. In other  words, will anyone actually read it through and need one do so? The answer to  both questions, I fear, is no. One need not read all of Travis’s chapters, nor read  them sequentially; they are related in topic but change in focus—from the atten- tion given to the body of the narrator in the links to the Canterbury Tales, to the  exemplum-like setting of the tale’s opening, to the critical difference between  noise and harmony. There is also some repetition throughout its discussion of  the work of parody and metapoetics: hence why the chapters once worked so well  as individual articles. but another way of putting this would be to say that Travis’s  analysis of schoolroom parody and imitation does a good deal of imitating of  its own. That is, if the Nun’s Priest’s Tale is Chaucer’s ars poetica and thus poetic  summary statement on a lifetime of written practice, so is Disseminal Chaucer a  statement of Travis’s own.  what does that mean for Travis’s book and its status over and above the essays  that make up its content? On the one hand Travis has gone to the trouble of  thinking the essays through as a whole, which is where we get some of the large  “theoretical” apparatus of irony, parody, and deconstruction weaving his critical  pieces together. In that sense, Travis is quite thoughtful about the larger terms to  which the independent essays point, and he is careful about how they add up to  and account for his overarching claims about the Nun’s Priest’s Tale (thus, how  the book appears most clearly as Travis’s own ars). If the Nun’s Priest’s Tale sums  up Chaucer on poetics, Disseminal Chaucer sums up Travis on poetic interpretation.  but on the other hand, we might weigh the cost of collecting, cohering, and sum- ming up in this way. The independent essays belong not merely to Travis’s personal  history of reading but have their own existence in time. Put simply, work ranging  JEGP 111_1 text.indd   133 11/18/11   8:24 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> 134 Journal of English and Germanic Philology, January 2012 over a span of more than 20 years will inevitably meet some kind of response (at  least one hopes), but incorporating the effects of one’s own work can be exceed- ingly difficult. The endeavor inevitably meets with varied success and produces  an unevenness that makes reprints a risky business. I won’t pretend to have done  a complete comparison of each chapter with the previously published essay, but  one immediately notices the complete absence of Jill Mann’s essays on Chaucer’s  “Cato” and the grammar school texts used in the Nun’s Priest’s Tale (essays that  were, of course, unavailable when Travis originally wrote these chapters). Ironically,  these are the subject of a book by Mann appearing nearly simultaneously with  Travis’s own. This is not to say that he has neglected to update his bibliography or  to engage with more recent critical materials. Rather, the updating is written into  the links in the book and the introductory materials of each chapter that suture  the work(s) together, not in the main body of each argument.  If the material here is thus not entirely new, the book’s fresh approach to detail  and its sustained linguistic attention is newly appreciated, innovative in its return  to a textual focus too often neglected for larger theorizations and narrow histori- cal contexts. Travis shows us, yet again, the compelling power of strong, sustained  close reading for one of Chaucer’s best stories. Elizabeth Scala University of Texas Constructing Chaucer: Author and Autofiction in the Critical Tradi- tion. by Geoffrey w. Gust. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. Pp. xiv +  286. $95. The argument of this book is that we have given up on the notion of the literary  persona just at the moment when we need it the most in Chaucer studies. Most  of us think of the persona as an artifact of modernist and humanist criticism,  masking but speaking as if for the real authorial subject. Gust, in contrast, seeks to  “queer” the persona, and in fact argues that the concept of the persona is already  “queer,” destabilizing the possibility of a centered, essential identity. The persona,  he argues, has been ignored or underemployed as a clarifying concept in criticism  from the fifteenth through the twenty-first century, and long stretches of the book  take up this progress, or lack of it, concerning a series of critical conundrums in  Chaucer scholarship: the pilgrim narrator, the biography of the poet, Chaucer’s  direct voice in the short poems and the Retraction, the pairing of the wife of bath  and the Pardoner, and the Tale of Sir Thopas and the Tale of Melibee ostensibly  told by the “popet” figure who seems to be Chaucer himself. This is a book that  begins with its weakest chapter and gets somewhat stronger as it proceeds.  Gust argues that “the crux for virtually any understanding of Chaucer’s poetry  is to be located in his self-conscious use and manipulation of diverse narrative  personae” (p. 2). Chaucer’s paradoxical combination of confidence and humility  results in the difficulty readers have had achieving consensus about the meaning  of Chaucer’s works. while study of the persona has fallen out of fashion in the  twenty-first century, he notes, it had a considerable theoretical justification in the  Middle Ages. Gust’s first chapter, “Persona and Personalities: Medieval Lineage,  Modern Legacy,” sets the agenda for the rest of the book, attempting to analyze  the history of Chaucer’s reception with a critical intervention into contemporary  discourse. As with those following chapters, however, one has the uneasy feeling  that the author is attempting to reopen questions that have been more or less  JEGP 111_1 text.indd   134 11/18/11   8:24 AM </page> </plain_text>
