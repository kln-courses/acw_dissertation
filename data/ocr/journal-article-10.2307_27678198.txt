<plain_text><page sequence="1">Imaging God in Christian Thought Robert Dunlop All Christian theology is concerned with the God question. The struggle to set forth an image of the Divine Being which correctly and sufficiently unveils the mystery which is God, is complex and permanent. Fascination with the nature of God has driven theolo gians into flights of fancy or bolt holes of escape. Those who are attracted to the notion that the 'sky is empty' are left with little raw material with which to stimulate faith. They are only one step removed form Bishop Robinson's position which he articulated in Honest to God. There we read: 'He who knows about depth knows about God . . . not a projection "out there", an other beyond the skies . . . but the ground of our very being.' Such speculative meanderings have not contributed too much substance to the search for God. At the same time attempts to conceptualize God in the images of classical thought-forms have run into serious difficulties because they have been proved inadequate while claim ing to be definitive. In fairness, those who first drew up these classical statements may not have intended them to create a situa tion where they have been used as the 'last word' in God-talk. Greek ontological categories are no longer the most appropriate vehicles to bear the burden of representing God to humanity. They are too restricted to do justice to the vastness and mysteriousness of the being they attempt to describe and define. Their worst feature is their tendency to open the way for a view of God which is objectified to a degree which is at variance with Hebrew thought and the best biblical tradition. Failure to take note of Tersteegen's warning that 'a God comprehended is no longer God' results in the collapse of adoring wonder and in the end privatizes and diminishes God. merit in the mystical method The mystical search has the merit of retaining a sense of wonder and preserves the seeker after the infinite from cold categories, neat Robert Dunlop is a Baptist minister who lives at Brannockstown Manse, Kilcullen, Co. Kildare, and studies theology at Trinity College, Dublin.</page><page sequence="2">IMAGING GOD IN CHRISTIAN THOUGHT 31 definitions and dogmatic assertions. Here the emphasis is on the hiddenness of God which the Dominican Eckhart described as 'the abyss without mode and without form, the silent and wild divinity . . . like a desert where there is neither work nor image'. Tauler develops this idea further when he speaks of 'the divine obscurity, where the spirit loses itself, is conscious neither of God nor of itself. We have to wait for Merton to offer a spirituality which pro vides some certitude to the God ward traveller. His language has a paradoxical ring: 'We cannot arrive at the perfect possession of God in this life and that is why we are travelling and in darkness. But we already possess him by grace, and therefore in that sense we have arrived and are dwelling in the light.' This union with God in prayer in Merton's experience and thought is 'to disappear into God ... to be lost in the secret of his face'. The central thrust of his theology is concerned with preserving the otherness and vastness of God within a relationship of faith. Contemplation does not simply 'find' a clear idea of God and confine him within the limits of that idea, and hold him there as a prisoner to whom it can always return. On the contrary, contemplation is carried away by him into his own realm, his own mystery and his own freedom. It is pure and virginal knowledge, poor in concepts, poorer still in reasoning but able, by its very poverty and purity, to follow the Word 'wherever he may go' (New Seeds of Contemplation, p. 5). Our activistic age needs the challenges and cautions of mystical spiritual formation. Their gentleness and sensitivity is a healthy counterbalance to those who stand in danger of assuming that their knowledge of God is absolute. Their lasting insights point to the fact that God is outwith the most profound experience of him and that at best we are only dimly in touch with the edges of his ways. ENGAGING THE BIBLICAL MODELS In the persistent search for better and more meaningful ways of imaging the infinite it is well to remain open to the diverse ways in which human beings may discover a disclosure of the divine. The rich and varied approaches of the biblical writers present us with a colourful tapestry of useful insights. The Bible sets out a vision of God which is concerned to portray the immeasurable greatness of the Divine Being. This material is set within the historical pro cess and grounded in the experience of the people of God. Images of God are chosen from the vocabulary of the community of faith and projected on to the God of Israel. Since this mode of thought arises out of a relational model, where God is in covenant fellowship with his people, we are not surprised to find an emphasis in Hebrew thought on God as 'Father', 'Shepherd' and 'Sustainer'</page><page sequence="3">32 THE FURROW of his chosen ones. It is essential to recognize the validity of anthropomorphism - attempts to transpose positive and good human characteristics on to God. But it is also necessary to argue against the finality or sufficiency of such imaging. We are all familiar with the popular tendency to think of God as bearing the features of a benevolent human being. A theologian of the stature of Karl Barth has expressed the view that such a procedure is appropriate and effective - 'according to the analogy of being, fatherhood is one of the most significant analogies that human experience affords to describe God . . . God has graciously con ferred upon human paternity certain attributes that reflect his own eternal and perfect fatherhood.' Those who have a positive vision of fatherhood are helped by such an analogy but it breaks down in a situation where there is serious alienation within the family unit. For someone whose male parent was a tyrant the concept of God as father isn't only meaningless but totally repugnant. We must wrestle with the problem of finding fitting models which appeal to the modern mind and fit today's need. The feminist critique has much to offer in this area and chal lenges us to re-think some of the vocabulary used to image God in Christian theology. The imperialistic, patriarchal model has no place in such an understanding of the basic relationship between God and humanity. While the 'father' model interpreted nonpatriar chially is certainly an appropriate one, other models are also necessary to express dimensions of the new transforming rela tionship with God which lies at the base of Christianity - models which stress aspects which the father model cannot, such as friend, lover, mother, liberator, healer, comrade, helper (Sally McFague in Christian Theology, p. 333). Christians should not hesitate to investigate the multiple images of God in Old Testament writing. If all the names and images are brought into focus they will enrich the community and may even throw up some surprises. For example, the familiar title El Shaddai, translated 'God Almighty' may come from the noun shad, which portrays God as 'the Breasted One' and it is only a short step to the idea of the 'Mother-love of God'. We must be spared the excesses of frozen terminology which produces a static view of God and opens the door to corrupting and marring the vision we set out to appreciate and admire. CHRISTOLOGY HAS A CONTRIBUTION The massive impact of the incarnation event advances the quest for a fuller understanding of God. No serious theological pursuit of an appropriate and adequate image of God can avoid the Christo</page><page sequence="4">IMAGING GOD IN CHRISTIAN THOUGHT 33 logical question which is at the centre of New Testament thought. According to the author of Hebrews 'the Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being' (Hebrews 1:3). The Messianic claim 'whoever has seen me has seen the Father' brings into focus the significance of the incarnate Christ in formulating a vision of God. The enfleshment of the eternal Word in the high Christology of John makes all the difference in humanity's search for the infinite. 'No one has ever seen God, but God the only (Son), who is at the Father's side, has made him known' (John 1:18, N.I.V.). Critics of the Christology of John rightly point out that his presentation is heavily influenced by Greek ontological categories and for this reason they tend to dismiss his contribution to the task of finding a fitting picture of God. As long as John's language and insights are balanced by the lower Christology of the Synoptic writers they are positively useful in the ongoing task of expressing in intelligible form some ideas of what God is like. If the incarnational model is abandoned our vision of God is impoverished and weakened. As long as our reflec tion is not trammelled by the static perspective of being affirmed at Chalcedon, progress is possible without sacrificing too much biblical ground or ignoring too much Christian history. RESCUING GOD FOR A BETTER CHURCH In the contemporary theological climate in Ireland the business of re-imaging God is urgent and demanding. Since there is a long and painful confusion between ecclesiology and theology in many devout minds, the equation 'Church = God' is dangerously near. Indeed, a true attempt to re-cast God as the discoverable presence at the centre of the community of the faithful would liberate the Church from an obsession with itself and also release God from the prison house of identification with the ecclesiastical establishment. There is a crucial distinction between regarding the ecclesial com munity as the place where God is encountered and treating the institutional Church as an extension of God, outside of which encounter is unlikely. One could argue effectively that both Catholicism and Protestantism have been guilty of tunnel vision in imaging God and out of that dimly-lit perspective hijacking the Eternal in an attempt to make him the originator, patron and pro tector of each and every system where he is allegedly present. Many thoughtful Irish Christians in various traditions are protesting against all these attempts to humiliate the Deity by reducing him to a private and powerful patron in the sky! Those who sit in our pews need to be delivered from such cruelty and if they are not, they may well head for the door and bang it as they leave. In the exciting and exacting theological task of probing more</page><page sequence="5">34 THE FURROW deeply into the mystery of God there are many pitfalls and a multitude of rewards. In the end such a pilgrimage will only be worthwhile if there is a blending of all the skills available to the theologian - historical, linguistic, philosophical, scientific - to name a few. The unfinished task confronting the enquiring mind calls for every available effort if God isn't going to be continually misrepresented in the house of his friends and lost altogether to the growing number of thinking people who are sitting loose to the traditional community where God was expected to be experienced. Such an undertaking can be pursued from a position of faith and wonder. The immeasurable greatness of the Lord of Life should challenge the committed to agonize over finding better ways of offering him to the alienated. A Barthian paradox is not without merit when it speaks of God 'who remains a mystery to us because he himself has made himself so clear and certain to us'. Our con temporary communities of faith must not be shortchanged in the area of theological reflection which is at the kernel of the Church's life and work. Unless something intelligent can be said about God we are left unmoored in the wild waters of human anxiety. It is more comfortable to float in the still waters of traditional concepts but so much more exhilarating to plunge into the stormy seas of theological imagination and do business in great waters. Imagina tive reflection has a solid base in Christian thought but is urgently in need of recovery in Irish Christianity. When the rich and varied approaches to the God question are brought into the foreground of contemporary theological thought and ecclesial life they will pro vide criteria for a maturing Christianity in the land of saints and scholars. We stand to gain much from such a development because it sets the scene for a renewed style of Christian discipleship which is balanced between affirmative devotion: 'You are my God' - and adoring enquiry - 'Whose ways are past finding out.' Only then will we escape J. B. Phillips's crisp castigation, 'Your God is too small.'</page></plain_text>
