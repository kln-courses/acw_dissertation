(Institut Français d'Archéologie de Beyrouth. Biblio- thèque Archéologique et Historique, tome LXV.) In the skilful hands and under the perspi- cacious direction of Professor Parrot Mari has proved to be an inexhaustible treasure-house of incalculable riches. This book gives an account of the results obtained from a prolonged ex- amination of the material found during the four seasons of excavations 1934-1937 at the Temple of Ištar where the carefully stratified building levels supplied a chronological basis for the classification of the objects discovered. Part of a wall of unbaked bricks was the only evidence for the earliest occupational level reached by the excavations, Level F. In the second level, E, the foundations of the buildings, traces of oblong rooms in a double alignment round, an open court, were of well-cut, well-aligned gypsum slabs, proving that in the Jamdat Nasr and First Early Dynastic periods the architecture of Level E was culturally far advanced. About 8 m. to west there must have been another building based on the great stone carpet of paving later utilized as substructure for buildings of Level C. Separated from the preceding phases by a phase void of construction the buildings of Level D form two groups characterized by the simultaneous use of stone, unbaked bricks and plastered floors. To west was a sanctuary, to east a dwelling, probably the residence of the priests and temple</page><page sequence="2">404 Rezensionen. flat-bottomed dish (figs. 30, 31). At the base of the podium fragmentary ex voto were disinterred. A document of great importance for the history of Mari came to íight in Court 20. It was the statuette of Lamgi-Mari which bore his dedication inscribed on its back and shoulder. Not only does it give the name of one of the early kings of Mari, but for the first time it makes known the divinity to whom the temple was dedicated, the «virile Ištar». Although badly damaged the residential sector yielded abundant ceramics. In contrast to Levels D, C, B, where no traces of violent overthrow were revealed, Level A showed unmistakable signs of pitiless destruction, ex voto and statuettes ruthlessly smashed and marks of incendiarism everywhere. After this destruction about 2500 B. C. the temple of Ištar was rebuilt, as the ritual found in the palace attests, but no coherent plan of this last phaee could be obtained. All the finds, cera- mics, fragments of statues, etc., were of the period contemporaneous with that of the First Dynasty of Babylon. For the first time a wall of defence enclosed the sacred precinct, but did not suffice to protect it from the utter annihilation inflicted by the victorious soldiers of Hammurabi. Excavations in the near-by city area entirely corroborated the evidence supplied by the temple. Two building periods, architecturally clearly dis- tinct although immediately superimposed, demon- strated that a city contemporaneous with the palace covered the remains of the presargonid town without any indication of an intermediate Akkadian phase such as was observable in other parts of Mari. The earlier statuettes which adorned the temple were destroyed by victorious invaders, those of the later period were broken and tossed into wells by the Babylonian conquerors. Patient labour has succeeded in piecing together some of the fragmentary statuettes. The more important were of alabaster or of rosy breccia, the more ordinary of gypsum from the neighbouring quarries. It was only in post-Akkadian times that at Mari diorite or steatite were used. Many of them must have been stock figures of a worshipper, but some of officials may have been portraits. Two other inscribed statues confirm the dedication to «virile Ištar». Changing fashions in clothing and in hair- dressing for men can be studied. Female statuettes are characterized by the «polos» head-dress, on some of which traces of colour are still preserved. They are all un inscribed, and nothing testifies as to whether they represent worshippers or divinities. Perhaps all those shown standing with folded hands were the former; those seated and holding a cluster of dates may have portrayed queens or divinities. In presargonid times a group of two figures was rare. The seated «couple enlaced» are appealing, even if headless, and are reminiscent of the divine couple portrayed in similar attitudes A doorway in the dividing wall led from the court to the cella which was abundantly provided with foundation deposits of an unique type, a long copper nail with a head in the shape of a flat semicircular ring through which a headless peg was thrust into the ground. These nails were accompanied by two little anepigraphic tablets, one of lapis lazuli, the other, slightly larger, of white stone placed in diverse positions on or beside the nails. Occasionally a thin silver tablet was added. Fig. 38 shows exactly where every deposit was found. At Mari, where no foundation figurine has ever been discovered, this was the traditional type of foundation deposit found in several temples from the time of these presargonid specimens almost unchanged to the time of Hammurabi. Here it may be observed that they were basically the type of foundation deposits dedicated by Ur-Nanše at Lagaš, except that there the head of the peg was in the shape of a female figurine. This suggests that at Mari the original aniconic type of foundation deposit was always maintained, whereas at Lagaš where, perhaps, a stronger anthropomorphic tendency prevailed, the peg was transformed into a female figurine representing one of the divine guardians. It is probable that the uninscribed tablets were emblematic of the bricks with which the temple would be constructed ; it might even be said they symbolized the spirit of the bricks here immured to ensure the firm foundation of the temple. If this surmise is correct these finds at Mari represented and always adhered to the earliest type of foundation deposit, the only trace of which elsewhere was the peg shape of the foundation figurine. Beyond a rise in floor level and some minor modifications there were few changes in Level В or, in many respects, in Level A. The doorway leading to the town area was transferred to the north-east corner of the enclosure wall, and the two fine gypsum slabs paving the threshold indicate that, although no door-sockets were found, double doors closed the entrance. The columns and portico of the north court (15) had vanished. Statuettes and large fragments of stone ritual utensils were found as well as a basin for ablutions, an altar for burnt sacrifices, and a table for offerings. The floor level was raised almost to the height of the top of the Level В podium which was replaced by a larger one of brick fre- quently replastered, thus concealing a big bronze «barcasse» and at least six subsequent ceramic specimens inserted one within another. The most remarkable feature of Level A was the addition of a second cella (18) with its court (20) erected on the great stone platform of Level E . This cella was contiguous to but independent of the earlier cella (17). Bronze foundation nails with the accompanying tablets came to light (fig. 38), and «bar casses» at various points, in two places surmounted by a «bénitier», a deep,</page><page sequence="3">Rezensionen. 405 on a stele 1. The grotesqueness of the pair of temple musicians may be due to ineptitude on the sculptor's part rather than to an intentional caricature. Among other finds were broken pieces of big stone vessels decorated in relief, fragmentary reliefs of banqueting scenes, and a little figurine of a pair of manheaded bulls, as well as innumerable chips of curls and strands of hair from the lapis lazuli beards of similar bulls. A hypothetical reconstruction has been made of the widely scattered pieces of a composition in shell mosaic which must have borne some resemblance to the one discovered at Kiš, for it pictured soldiers conducting prisoners to their leader, musicians to hymn the victory, and a quadriga. Professor Parrot proves convincingly that the bovine figure crowning a tall lanceolated shaft could not have been a rein-ring on the chariot-pole for which, indeed, the shaft is much too long. It has therefore been restored as being held aloft in front of him by the official who heads the pro- cession of «dignitaries». This restoration seems to strike a false note. It is not certain that the figure ever occupied that position or held the symbol aloft in the modern manner, or even that he held it at all, for the object remaining in his hands is quite short and does not combine organi- cally with the shaft. Seals of the time of Uruk III show symbols held in front of the bearers, but not raised aloft 2. In later ages the Stele of the Vultures and, more clearly, Gudea's stelai prove that symbols were carried resting against the bearer's shoulder so that they are seen behind his head which partly conceals the shaft 3. It is easier to criticise, however, than to suggest a better place for the symbol. The description of the glyptic finds, which al- most all belong to the presargonid periods, does not adhere to a strictly chronological order. Instead of beginning with the characteristic Jamdat Nasr seals 586, 251, 1422, which are relegated to the end, the catalogue is initiated by a discussion as to the significance of what is represented in the three registers of the stupendous cylinder seal M. 329. M. 1388 is transitional in style between the Second and Third Early Dynastic periods; it seems to be the earliest example of a figure standing on one leg with the other crossed over it at hip -height, often described as the pose of a dancer.

No. 561 may be a very primitive local version of the same motif. The clay figurines are not numerous and are all feminine with the exception of a few frag- mentary male examples and some crudely modelled animals. One type of nude female found at Mari in every sector is also known at Aššur and other sites. Such meticulously carried out excavations demonstrate in a remarkable way how the early periods succeeded one another. The more the reader studies this book the more precious material does he discover, and our gratitude is due to Professor André Parrot for revealing to us a wonderful new chapter in the history, art and architecture of Mari.
