Dick's cool novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, was an overheated farrago of SF crossed with private eye machismo and dragged down by pretentious sets. Part of its storyline and at least one of its characters was roped in from another Dick novel, We Can Build You. . . . When Dick's novel was filmed in 1982 by Ridley Scott, its complex story-line was butchered to a single plot-strand of bounty hunter pursuing renegade humanoid robots. While it made effective SF cinema on that simplistic level, it nonethe- less threw away the opportunity of making a brilliant and telling film. Gone was the level of the book which dealt with the moral problem of empathy. Gone were Rick Decard's [sic] marital problems and his fears about his own authenticity. Gone was the whole question of human worth as something not to be measured in simple IQ terms. Gone was the delicate humor, the sympathetic characterization, and one vital scene where Decard is forced to kill a female android who is the precise double of Rachel [sic], the android woman he loves. In its place was a heavy-handed adventure-packed and sensationalized robot yarn with a tough-guy hero (Harrison Ford) from 19</page><page sequence="2">20/Bibliography the school of Marlowe, who wins through and even gets the girl (admittedly artificial - but with all important distinctions ironed out) at the end. Allan, Elkan, ed. A Guide to World Cinema. London: Whittet Books Ltd., 1985. 57. Brief synopsis. 1 still. Blade Runner presents a future where robots are on the brink of developing human emotions. Harrison Ford plays a bounty hunter who must track down four escaped slave replicants but in doing so falls in love with one. The sets - a sort of wet, steamy Chinatown and a completely deserted block of flats where the robots' designer lives - are quite staggering. Alliez, Eric and Michel Feher.

It is a spectacle in which the "real" inhabitants of the metropolis are not spectators enjoined to identify with the actors or the director, but the film's extras ... the production of more and more sophisticated simulacra imperils the formal distinction between human beings and machines - a potentially dangerous situation until an artificial humanity is implanted into the brains of the replicants, destroying any claim to real humanity they might have. Anderson, George. "A Look at Two New Science-Fiction Movies." Pittsburgh Post- Gazette , 25 June 1982, pp. 21, 24. Review, 1 still. Blade Runner may be the wrong picture at the wrong time. . . . The predominant impression is of wetness. It seems to rain all the time in that futuristic city, and everything is saturated with a clamminess that seeps into your subconscious before the film is over. It's hard to avoid thinking that if only these characters could dry out, maybe their troubles would go away. . . . Basically, however, Blade Runner is simply a particularly unpleasant detective story. . . . Even though Harrison Ford gives his best performance to date, it is done in a losing cause. Blade Runner does not alter a time-honored rule from the Moviegoer's Guide to Survival: "Beware of movies with more than three producers." Andrews, Rena. " Blade Runner Needs Sharpening." The Denver Post , 25 June 1982, Weekend: 6. Review, credits, 1 still. Scott apparently was concerned more with design - imaginative and obviously terribly costly sets and visual gimmicks - and allowed the script's ideas to become as confused as the Babel-like world of polyglots who roam the streets. While Scott is immensely visual, he doesn't demonstrate an ear for dialogue effect nor is he responsive to the complex emotions his actors will have to demonstrate to be believable. As a result, Blade Runner is a film of lost opportunities. There is haunting, blues-like music by Vangelis . . . great special effects, stunning sets and actors who are trying, especially Hauer. . . . Ford appears aimless and a little tired as the blade runner and even his solitary love scene lacks the passion of the human element. It's all very sad because this severely flawed movie could have been so much more than it is - a thriller without thrills, a violent, graceless, dark space story an evolved android might have executed better. Arnold, Gary. "Future Cop." The Washington Post , 25 June 1982, sec. C: 1 ,4. Review, 1 still. Pictorially stunning. . . . However, this flamboyant attempt by the director of The Duelists and Alien to synthesize an ominous, futuristic setting with the motley clichés of hard-boiled detective fiction is at best a freakish success. . . . The contradictions that plague the movie are apparent from the outset. . . . Invariably overexplicit, the narration tells you more than you want to know and probably need to know, despite the murkiness of certain aspects of the plot. . . . Blade Runner plummets when it contrives its cross-species love story. Dick's framework might be guessed from random illustrative details in Blade Runner , but it's no longer a controlling factor. The movie might just as well be happening in a future of simultaneous urban decay and hi-tech advancement that evolved without the specific impetus of a global catastrophe. Unfortunately, the loss of this context leaves the filmmakers at a thematic loss. They try to compensate with a dense, brilliant scenic texture, but it still doesn't compensate for the lost, or at least misplaced, context. . Review of Blade Runner.

In the film's single most beautiful sequence - inside the Tyrell pyramid, looking out at a golden setting sun - we meet Rachael, Dr. Tyrell's special assistant and his special pride ... the film is brilliant in its sleight-of-hand; its amazing surfaces catch us before we notice that the plot doesn't answer its own questions. If the story is frail and unhelpful, to put it politely, it is certainly drenched in atmosphere. Blade Runner may attract two and three-timers to savor its inventions. ... It has the palette and the sense of decadent, controlled clutter of Polaroid artist Maria Cosindas, the necrophiliac chic of photographer Deborah Tuberville.

" Blade Runner. A Loner Movie Without Cutting Edge." The Pittsburgh Press , 25 June 1982, sec. A: 14. Review, 2 stills. Alas, good ideas are wasted faster than replicants. As adapted by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples from the late Philip K. Dick's novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner short-sells its best chances to rise above routine action. . . . Human quality keeps getting lost or blown away. . . . When Batty vengefully says, "Quite an experience to live in fear. That's what it is to be a slave," moviegoers might well wonder how he'd know, considering his invulnerability to anything as human as fear or the degradation of submissiveness. The production design of Blade Runner is impressive, but the howling of wolves and the all-too-sporadic music by Vangelis can compensate only so much for a dispiritedness that goes beyond the perimeters of the movie to encompasss it. Its unpleasantness isn't offset by mystery, or a sense of wonder about the times, or even the requisite quotient of thrills. . . . The oddness of Blade Runner undoubtedly will help it achieve cult status. Bloom, John. "Republican Pod People, Circa 1982." Dallas Times Herald , 25 June 1982, sec. F: 1,4. Review, 1 still. Something about America under Republicans can always bring the science-fiction ghouls out. . . . the most remarkable thing about this film, made by Ridley Scott of Alien notoriety, is its visual intensity, an evocation of an American city in the year 2020 with white-hot lights and smokey shapes that are vaguely recognizable and yet exotically original. . . . Once it does take off, though, the action is relentless, unpredictable, and, in the climactic sequence, terrifying as Ford deals with the replicants one by one. . . . Blade Runner is a well-crafted film, even despite occasional lapses and its occasional reliance on heavy-handed, graphic violence. I suspect history will be kinder to it than the critics.

As Trumbull says in a press release, "I think Blade Runner is very accurate on a technological level. One of the things about this film is that it's filled with merchandise. It's just pervaded with high technology, and that's probably the way we are headed." Although the set designs and special effects in Star Trek I I and Blade Runner are superb, these movies are doomed to a futuristic garbage dump because there's a big, black narrative hole in their dramatic centers. .

Except for Harrison Ford's interpretation of Deckard as a Bogey-like private eye and Rutger Hauer's manic portrayal of a sadistic replicant, Blade Runner is devoid of fully developed characters, and following the plot by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples evokes a dizzying stroll through a hall of mirrors. . . .

International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers: Films. Christopher Lyon, ed. Chicago: MacMillan Publishers Ltd., 1984. 59-60. Credits, review. In a genre of cardboard comic-strip heroes, Deckard is, refreshingly, very real. Technically, Blade Runner is an extraordinary accomplishment. Rarely has a film reached such a high level of artistic excellence in so many different areas. The wide-screen photography, art direction, set design, costumes and visual effects are surpassed only by the Vangelis music score, a once-in-a- lifetime achievement of such penetratingly haunting fatalism that, in order to feel, as well as see, Blade Runner , only Dolby stereo will do. . . . easily the finest adult fantasy film since Stanley Kubrick's 2001 : A Space Odyssey. Bray, Hiawatha. Review of Blade Runner. Christianity Today 26, No. 14 (3 September 1982): 97. Reviews. A surprisingly serious science-fiction release. . . . [the] replicants, driven by memories of life and the fear of death, are trying desperately to contact their maker in Los Angeles and beg for life. On this level, the film is a chilling allegory about man's relationship to God. But more disturbing is the fact that Deckard himself, unlike his targets, has no Maker to confront. He comes to love one of his targets, the first strong emotion he has felt in years, except for fear. And as he loves her, and kills the others, he begins to understand how little difference there is between himself and the replicants. They are all afraid, lonely, doomed. But a blade-runner has no designer, no higher power to appeal to. . . . Blade Runner bails out at the end with a classic Hollywood cop-out, and its plot is occasionally blurred and difficult to follow. . . . This isn't a family film, and it's not for the squeamish. But of all the summer's releases, only Blade Runner is truly adult in its thoughtfulness and complexity. Brien, Alan. "The Arts: Present Tense, Future Imperfect." The Sunday Times [London], 12 September 1982, p. 34. Review. How do we know we are human? Is a "blade runner" any less a conditioned machine than a "replicant?" Have we all not inside us an auto-destruct device that ends our lives without warning? What proof is there that the universe exists and that our memories are of a real past? The questions, so central to the book, are here peripheral and often obscurely introduced. Nevertheless, despite this flaw which sometimes seems to turn Blade Runner into two separate films uneasily superimposed, this remains a richly detailed and visually overwhelming acid trip to 2019 which sticks with you like a recurrent nightmare you cannot shake loose.

To shoot the models of the flying cars - called Spinners - Trumbull and team utilized the motion control camera techniques developed by Dykstra for Star Wars but instead of shooting the models against a blue screen Trumbull used a background of illuminated smoke (actually emulsified oil). First the computer-controlled camera made a pass by the model suspended against the "smoke" background and then the same pass was made again without the smoke in order to create a high contrast matte. When the shots of the models were matted into the footage of the miniature cityscape, also photographed using "smoke," the result was a much more textured composite shot than usual, with none of the hard edges of blue screen model shots.

It's a world of tough cops bending the law (so what else is new?), brilliant scientists hatching their unmanageable creations, and sensory stimulations revved up about 35 years worth beyond those we know today. Blade Runner makes us laugh at the start and the finish, since it is cast in the time-honored format of voice-over narration familiar to us from 1940s detective flicks. Mostly, however, it is scary as all getout. Not the robot stuff, but rather the settings and the futuristic lifestyles. Bruno, Giuliana. "Ramble City: Postmodernism and Blade Runner ." October No. 41 (Summer 1987): 61-74. Essay, 4 stills. Asked to name all the good things that come to his mind thinking about his mother, Leon explodes, "My mother, I'll tell you about my mother," and kills the inquirer. The mother is necessary to the claiming of a history, to the affirmation of an identity over time. Unmasked by the same test, Rachel (sic) goes to her inquirer, Deckard, to convince him, or herself rather, that she is not a replicant. Her argument is a photograph, a photograph of a mother and a daughter. "Look, this is me, with my mother." That photograph represents the trace of an origin and thus a personal identity, the proof of having existed and therefore of having the right to exist. . . . Not only does Rachel exhibit her document-photograph of that past moment with her mother, but she is fascinated by photographs generally. In a second visit to Deckard, she produces her memories in response to his photographs. She attempts to look like the woman in his old photograph, and plays the piano to recapture a memory, an atmosphere. Leon's preciously kept pictures serve no apparent purpose other than the documentation of the replicant's existence in history. Deckard understands this motivation when he finds the photos. "I don't know why replicants would collect photos. Maybe they were like Rachel, they needed memories". . . . Photography is thus assigned the grand task of reasserting the referent, of reappropriating the Real and historical continuity. The historical referent is displaced by a photographic referent. In a world of fragmented temporality the research of history finds its image, its photographic simulacrum, while history itself remains out of reach. Butcher, Andrew J. "Letters Page."

Hence in the climactic scene, the ironies proliferate around the taunting question that Roy Batty, the most fearsome of the replicants, poses to Deckard as Roy stalks him. The question is "Aren't you the good man?" First of all, Deckard cannot say whether he is a man of any sort. Second, being a good man seems in this society to mean being a good killer, inhumane and affectless. Third, at the crucial moment it is Roy who acts humanely, sparing and even saving his victim, out of a love of life. And these ironies are further compounded by the tribute paid to Deckard after his violent mission is completed: "You've done a man's job." Cain, Scott.

The effects are stunning. The picture shows us a future that is both frightening and exciting. ... An unfortunate aspect of the script is that Deckard is an almost incompetent sleuth and, just as bad, is barely able to take care of himself in a fight. . . . Blade Runner is unrelentingly grim and, consequently, Harrison Ford is not seen to best advantage. His dry sense of humor has no opportunity for expression.

The matter of paranoia is one of the most pervasive elements of the film, most noticeable in the eye motif. . . . However, the true violence of the film lies not in the actual events portrayed, but in the atmosphere of the film, and this teaches us a very valuable lesson: the violence of intrusion, the horror of the loss of privacy.

"Oh, he answered, "the breaking of the fingers - we went wide on that one. People think you are seeing these things, but all you really hear is the sound of fingers breaking."

Review, 1 still. Blade Runner , like its setting, is a beautiful, deadly organism that devours life, and Ford . . . allows his heroic stature to shrivel inside it. In comparison, Hauer' s silver-haired superman is more human than human, and finally more complex than Ford's victimized flatfoot. Because of this imbalance of star roles, and because this drastically cut movie has a plot that proceeds by fits and stops, Blade Runner is likely to disappoint moveigoers hoping for sleek thrills and derring-do. But as a display terminal for the wizardry of designers Lawrence G. Pauli, Douglas Trumbull and Syd Mead, the movie delivers. The pleasures of texture have rarely been so savory. .

For reasons beyond human ken, Cassidy was often billed sixth in films, whether it was a brisk exploitation job like Stunts or a modestly budgeted thriller like the Late Show (she dunnit) or a superslick horror show like Blade Runner (she dressed in glitter and cellophane and got blasted through a store window in the second reel).

"'I'm Not a Supporting Actor': Combative Hauer Says He 'Can Carry a Film.'" Los Angeles Herald Examiner , 25 June 1982, sec. D: 4. Interview, 1 still. Hauer talks about his role in Blade Runner. "What would be interesting is that he pets every artificial dog that comes across his eyeline - or the sense is there that he wants to. That everything is a toy, more or less. The way he expresses himself is almost poetical. . . . And also," he says "there's the 4-year-old who likes to play 'boo!' And there's the joy for life - that's the basic motivation for them (the replicants) to come down to find Daddy. . . . The sort of relationship that comes out with Pris (played by Daryl Hannah)," Hauer explains, "I wanted to have with all of them. I wanted a small, little society where people were really nice to each other. We also had a scene we didn't shoot where we were together in one of those ugly-looking alleys, and we were having a sort of barbecue - old- fashioned romanticism that celebrates life. Now, it's a bit limited to my relationship with Pris. It's all there, but less comes out as being understandable". . . . The problem for his role, as Hauer sees it, was that the filmmakers made the decision to play up the love story between Ford and the experimental replicant Rachael, portrayed by Sean Young, instead of the replicants' story.

In America audiences have been going to see the film two or three times - not for the story, a rerun of a Philip Marlowe detective tale, but to catch the pieces of ingenious design and the future shock ideas that come so thick and fast that they cannot be taken in at one viewing. . . . Some American audiences have found the film terribly depressing but Scott counters: "It's fun, not to be taken seriously. It's just a look at what could actually happen if, let's say the genetic industry became a large conglomerate, a monopoly. We could have chosen to do a film about genetic engineering, which is a very serious subject. But we decided not to do that kind of movie. We decided to use elements of it and create our own comic strip. This film is not a warning in any sense of the word." Delson, James.

Oui , 11 No. 9 (September 1982): 111. Review. Ridley Scott is caught somewhere between the established masters of screen technique and the upcoming geniuses of his generation. His three films - The Duelists, Alien, and now Blade Runner - are as technically polished and artistically crafted as anything the masters have produced, but due to studio interference (Alien), budget deficits ( The Duelists ), and last-minute panic ( Blade Runner ), Scott has yet to maintain control throughout a production. Neverthless, Blade Runner though slightly flawed, offers an excellent opportunity to catch this blossoming talent at work .... A film to be experienced and savored, with enough excitement for the action fans and enough atmosphere for serious film enthusiasts, Blade Runner is one of the year's best pictures, and another building block in Ridley Scott's growing reputation.

Murkily lit and intentionally schlocky-looking, Blade Runner has the immense high-ceilinged rooms, zany camera angles, and pretentious, echoing dialog of a hundred naively bad experimental films.

More than simply a device then, to insure the plausible appearance of the city's buildings, the process of "layering" or "accumulated progress" also serves to develop a metaphoric argument based upon sight which answers the question raised by the film about what maks one human. . . . The film's visual design program develops the thematic concern of what it means to be human by suggesting that visual memory can create the capacity for empathie feelings in Replicants despite their not being created with the inborn response detected by the Voight-Kampff test. Thus as the narrative develops, references to eyesight and the accumulated memory of things seen seem to make even Replicants capable of empathetic responses. Dick, Philip K.

Though this mixture of film noir and science fiction undoubtedly contributed to Blade Runner's critical dismissal, it provides a key for appreciating the complexity of the film. . . . Reviews such as these are inadequate because they are based on personal or cultural aesthetic assumptions of what constitutes a "good" film. Of all potential approaches, an evaluative one provides neither a key or methodology for understanding the film better, nor does it allow for alternative readings from audience groups outside the reviewer's own. Our approach, an analysis of Blade Runner through this multi-generic construct, is not the only viable approach, nor does it reveal any one true meaning. Instead, it offers the spectator a structure with which to re-view the film. Dowell, Pat. Review of Blade Runner. The Washingtonian 17, No. 1 1 (August 1982): 51. Review. One of the screen's handful of great science-fiction movies. It's an extravagant gesture that gifted filmmakers sometimes make - dazzling, demented, magnificently vivid in its design of a world beyond our everyday reality. . . . There's one distracting flaw: a voice-over that has the clumsy feel of a producer's afterthought. Nevertheless, in this summer of mindless spectaculars, Blade Runner is a heady exception, a thriller spilling over with intelligence as well as action. Durgnat, Raymond. "Art for Film's Sake."

The movie's weakness, however, is that it allows the special effects technology to overwhelm its story. Ford is tough and low-key in the central role, and Rutger Hauer and Sean Young are effective as two of the replicants, but the movie isn't really interested in these people - or creatures. The obligatory love affair is pro forma, the villains are standard issue, and the climax is yet one more of those cliff-hangers, with Ford dangling over an abyss by his fingertips. The movie has the same trouble as the replicants: Instead of flesh and blood its dreams are of mechanical men. . Roger Eberť s Movie Home Companion 1987 Edition.

Our frustration and alienation stem not from the increasing presence of machines in our daily lives, but from the imperatives of production and consumption which those machines serve and from the human misuse and misapplication of technology.

Scott is a supreme visual stylist with a gift for design unequalled among contemporary directors, but he's wrong. Design is a vital element, especially if the audience is to accept anyone's physically imposing vision of the future, but staggering technical virtuosity - in and of itself - can never replace character and story values. Blade Runner proffers a thousand course feast for the eyes, but only bread and water for the mind and spirit. . . . The opening sequence ranks with the most astounding introductions to a film ever seen. ... A fitting counterpart to these awesome sights is Vangelis's soulful score, accented by cooly weaving sąx lines, snatches of mournful geisha ballad, and assorted wails. Soaring and eloquent, it is grandeur without pomposity, supplying much of the feeling the script and Scott refuse to provide. . . . But ultimately, it is Scott's indifference to real story substance, backed up by some human connection that does him in. . . .

Overwhelmed by the magnificent sets and attention-grabbing visuals, the slim narrative of trouble- shooter Rick Deckard (Ford) hunting down a group of semi-humanized robot replicants often threatens to disappear completely, especially when enigmatic fragments of Dick's original con- ception are reintroduced without explanation; and the recourse to voice-over musings from the hero smacks of a pre-release loss of confidence as much as of a generic homage.

This voice-over, which is said to have been a late addition, sounds ludicrous, and it breaks the visual hold of the material. . . . Blade Runner has nothing to give the audience - not even a second of sorrow for Sebastian. It hasn't been thought out in human terms.

But the renegades being pursued are not mere humans, they are manufactured people, created by scientific processes that are extensions of current breakthroughs in the field of genetic engineering. Kelleher, Terry. "Lively Arts: Future's Bleak in Blade ." The Miami Herald , 26 June 1982, sec. D: 6. Review. The encouraging news about the future is that newspapers and movie theaters will still be around four decades from now. . . . The discouraging news is just about everything else in Blade Runner ... a gratuitous, romantic ending . . . both patronizes and cheats the audience. After a depressing couple of hours at the movies, it's even more depressing to see the director succumb to a last-minute fear of being too depressing . . . Trumbull's special effects are ingenious but studiously unspectacular, as befits a world where inventions have done nothing to enrich life. Kellner, Douglas, Flo Leibowitz and Michael Ryan. " Blade Runner: A Diagnostic Critique." Jump Cut , No., 29 (February 1984): 6-8. Critique, 2 stills. Liberal and radical dystopia films focus on the dangers on increased pollution, nuclear war, and economic exploitation; and some contain veiled allegorical critiques of advanced capitalism (i.e., Alien, Outland, Blade Runner). They therefore make a critical commentary on current forms of life and social organization with images of what intensified corporate capitalism, political repres- sion, and contemporary forms of dehumanization might produce in the future. However, not all dystopias can be easily categorized ideologically. Some articulate complex and often contradictory attitudes toward, and anxieties about increasing mechanization and commodification of life in advanced capitalism, revealing possible ideological conflicts in such societies. We suggest that Blade Runner provides such a case of an ideologically ambivalent dystopia. Kempley, Rita. "Misandroidenous Blade Runner ." The Washington Post , 25 June 1982, Weekend: 13. Review, 1 still. A voluptuous vision of the future. . . . There's some gruesome dueling between Rick and the Replicants, but the violence becomes artful under Scott's direction. When Rick "retires" the dancer Zhora, she is wearing a kinky black bikini under a clear vinyl raincoat. She falls through window displays, the streaming blood candy-striping her coat, the glass shards and tearing skin forming a pattern of terrible beauty. Rick, like all old-fashioned gumshoes, is a fatalist, but with a conscience that stirs no matter how much booze he swills. Worse for the blade runner, he knows he's beginning to think of life as life and "retirement" as murder. And then there's this Rachael business. He unmasks her, proves her mother's a big petri dish and not the smiling woman in her treasured snapshot. (The still photograph for an instant becomes a moving frame) ....

In the 1980s we don't need forkloric seals of approval from the official Union of Non-Humans and Immortals (vampires, zombies, and mummies being cmef members) to quake at the notion of indestructibility. It's horrific enough - it's more horrific - when the death-defying creature who won't lie down appears to be a normal homo sapiens. Androids, for example, have been eating up the screen in recent years, in movies like Aliens, Blade Runner , and Android itself. The sinister thing about this line in superhuman non-humans is that we can't tell them from the real thing. Kerman, Judith B.

Mercer Island, WA: Starmont House, 1985. 69-75. A com- parison of the book and film to the private eye genre which reveals "entirely different emotional and intellectual experiences [between] the two works." It strikes me as a brilliant intuition to use the term [Blade Runner] in this film with a new ¿definition - it sounds like "gun-slinger," has the same structure (a weapon and an active noun) and its very semantic opacity makes it work well as a slang word of the future. Unlike both "bounty hunter" and "gun-slinger," "blade runner" carries no confusing connotation of the western, a story with different conventions and a very different setting. Kolb, William M. " Blade Runner ." [laser videodisc recording]. Los Angeles: The Criterion Collection, 1987. Introduction to film on album jacket. It is difficult to be ambivalent about Blade Runner. You either like it or dislike it intensely - or both - . . . . But however we interpret the movie, it is both intelligent and thought-provoking. It shows the tragedy of becoming inhuman by fighting inhumanity. It forces us to ask what happens if we cannot trust our memories; we rely on memory completely because memory tells us this has always worked in the past. But what if that memory is false? The consequences could well drive a human mad or make a replicant human. Kölker, Robert Philip. A Cinema of Loneliness . Penn, Kubrick, Scorsese, Spielberg, Altman 2nd ed.

Blade Runner varies in important ways from [the novel] - and the story suffers badly for that very reason; but Blade Runner ... is a major motion picture, with fascinating sets and great special effects.

Blade Runner , for all its gloom and somnolence, is a compelling addition to this [robot] genre. As a Philip Marlowe on the mean streets of a heartless future, Ford is reeducated in humanity by the nonhuman objects of his violent search - supercourtesan Joanna Cassidy, punk-waif Daryl Hannah, mighty fighter Rutger Hauer and beautiful Sean Young. Hauer, with a face like the prow of a ship and his turbine-pow- erful presence, is gripping as the desperate android who teaches the burnt-out Ford the meaning of fear and freedom. "Letters."

Ford, though a competent leading man, is reduced to a one-dimensional gumshoe clone who spends more time explaining the story via voiceover than he does taking action. Sean Young's romance with Ford is chopped up and put aside in favor of Ford's chase scenes, killing the film's only interesting dramatic relationship. Young herself is kept at emotional bay through- out, diminishing what promised to be a memorable role. . . . Weaknesses aside, Blade Runner is a stunning piece of work. ...

There are several scenes so moving in their spiritual humility that they verge on the hurtful, and this accomplishment (coupled with the most convincingly-de- tailed future world ever committed to film) is too rare to admire grudgingly. It's not perfect - it's overtextuned, erratically structured and a little too heavy on the Vangelis score. Harrison Ford's monotone narration - in which he sounds more bored than jaded, more fed-up than hard-boiled - is the worst problem. Lucas, William D. "Readers' Ratings."

This causes more concentration on the story, which unfortunately is Blade Runner's weak point. The film has many slow spots and some outright boring ones.

Chinatown (1974), the Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now (1979), and the futuristic Blade Runner (1982) all made good use of the noir sensibility, but each was in its own way too expensive and self-conscious to succeed in the hard-bitten and efficient terms of the films being rendered a homage. This is not to say that those later films did not succeed on their own terms - although all of the three had problems with unmotivated endings (Blade Runner's too innocent, Apocalypse Now' s ponderously confused, and Chinatown's a cheap paranoid flourish improvised by director Roman Polański in place of screenwriter Robert Towne's more careful conclusion) - but it does suggest that one of the virtues of film noir was the immediacy of its integrity, the brooding efficiency of its response to its own time.

"We did 1 1 weeks of exterior work on the backlot," said Scott. "All of it at night. There was a reason for that. That backlot isn't that big and if I hadn't filmed at night you'd have seen beyond the edge of the streets I used. That's the reason I had it raining all the time - you noticed less. Also I felt it gave reality to the situation. I was paranoid that otherwise it would look like the backlot." Martin, Anya. Review of Blade Runner. ConFederation Film and Video Program. 1986: 5. Review. Loosely based on Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner is a story about a communications gap between men and their creations. Rick Deckard, an ex-cop in the blade runner unit, thought he was retired, until five replicants (androids) escaped from a space-mining camp and he's assigned to track them down and kill them, or in city speak, retire them. But as Deckard learns, these replicants are less robots than artificially created human beings with emotions and an incredible will to survive even if it means eliminating a few blade runners who happen to get in their way. Director Ridley Scott's vision of a dark, smog-covered Los Angeles in 2019 A.D. is alluringly decadent, hauntingly beautiful with its neon lights and mirrored skyscrapers. The combination of this strange, fascinating view of the future and a cast of intriguing if haunted characters makes Blade Runner one of the most original, creative, and realistic science fiction films of all time.

A genuine science fiction film, this Ridley Scott {Alien) production is daring, thought provoking, and visually impressive. Harrison Ford stars as a futuristic Philip Marlowe trying to find and kill the world's remaining rebel androids in 2019 Los Angeles.

Honolulu Star-Bullentin , 25 June 1982, sec. B: 7. Review, 1 still. Essentially the same review as The New York Times. Ridley Scott's muddled yet fascinating Blade Runner begins with a stunning shot of this futuristic city and the rumbling of Vangelis's eerie, highly effective score. . . . Scott, who made his mark in Alien by showing a creature bursting forth from the body of one of its victims, tries to hit the same note here. One scene takes place in an eyeball factory. Two others show Deckard in vicious sadistic fights with women. One of these fights features strange calisthenics and unearthly shrieks. . "Screen: Futuristic Blade Runner ." The New York Times , 25 June 1982, sec. C: 10. Review, credits, 1 still. Muddled yet mesmerizing Blade Runner is as intricately detailed as anything a science-fiction film has yet envisioned. . . . And it's also a mess, at least as far as its narrative is concerned. Almost nothing is explained coherently, and the plot has great lapses, from the changeable nature of one key character to the frequent disappearances of another. . . . The end of the film is both gruesome and sentimental. Mr. Scott can't have it both ways, any more than he can expect overdecoration to carry a film that has neither strong characters nor a strong story. . "Special Effects Steal Show in Blade Runner ." The Montgomery Advertiser-Journal , 9 July 1982, Wham: 8. Review, 1 still. Essentially the same review as The New York Times. At several points in the story, Deckard is called on to wonder whether Rachael has feelings. This seems peculiar, because the icy, poised Rachael, played by Sean Young as a '40s heroine with spaceage trimmings, seems a lot more expressive than Deckard, who is played by Harrison Ford. Ford is, for a movie this darkly fanciful, rather a colorless hero, fading too easily into the bleak background. And he is often upstaged by Rutger Hauer . . . [who] is properly cold-blooded here, but there is something almost humorous behind his nastiness. "Film View: Changing Fashions in Fantasy." The New York Times , 18 July 1982, sec. II: 15. Article. Even the fantasy films that aren't wholly successful - like the current TRON and Blade Runner - reveal something about the climate in which they are made. These two films present humanity at its most cooly inhuman. The "living" computer creatures of TRON or the robot "replicants" of Blade Runner are perfectly soulless scientific creations, meant to dazzle an audience concerned solely with technology. These things are confounding and complex without being mysterious at all. Mathews, Jack. " Blade Runner Has Just the Right Blend of Ingredients." Detroit Free Press , 25 June 1982, sec. C: 3. Review, credits, 2 stills. It is an eye and a mind full, a spectacularly well-designed film that, despite one annoying and unnecessary dramatic device, is the most intelligent and foreboding look into the future of man's urban environment since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. . . . Scott did an amazing balancing act, giving equal prominence to the characters, the story and the visual backdrop. It's a film so visually remarkable, you could watch it with the sound turned off and still get your money's worth. But Scott never allowed himself to get caught up in the hardware and effects, as so many other science-fiction films do. He merely uses them to serve the story. ... He has Ford doing voice-over narration, telling us what we have just seen, and - unnecessarily - what it all means. By the simple act of erasing those lines from the soundtrack, Blade Runner would have been a much better movie. My other disappointment with the film was Scott's failure to develop the relationship between Ford and Rachael. . . . Overall though, Blade Runner is a triumphant blending of human drama and science fiction. It may not be a summer blockbuster - it won't satisfy the young audience it needs for that - but it's going to end up one of the summer's, and maybe the year's, best movies.</page><page sequence="23">Bibliography/41 .Review of Blade Runner.

Opening scenes alone are worth the price of admission. And the last half-hour becomes an exciting and tense game of cat-and-mouse. Unfortunately, it's the middle that is slow and muddled. Scott has to do some judicious pruning, clear up the ambiguities, and tie up some of the plot strings. Maza, Michael. " Blade Runner Takes Dim View of Future." The Arizona Republic [Phoenix], 28 June 1982, sec. B: 9. Review, credits, 1 still. Blade Runner may well be the most terrifying vision of the near future ever put on film ... as in Alien , the hardware takes a back seat to the humans. It is there only to help make the future believeable, and it does so admirably. . . . Blade Runner is not a pretty picture. Its physical violence is often gruesome, and the death throes of Pris are particularly harrowing. Its psychological violence is even more intimidating. Its humor - yes Blade Runner sometimes lightens its load with laughter - has a cynical bit reminiscent of Dashiell Hammett's detective stories. In fact, the close atmosphere of the 1940s is heavy throughout - in the masterful lighting, Ms. Young's zoot-suit costuming and in the splendidly mournful jazz saxophone riff around which composer Vangelis built the musical score. The picture does have its drawbacks, mostly in kinks of plot. But the only problem worth mentioning is Hauer' s hyperventilating - werewolf performance near the picture's end. . . .

Deckard returns to his apartment, collects the girl he professes his love to and drives out of the city. Up until this point, Blade Runner , was a strong endlessly interesting movie to watch. The plot was pretty weak, but the incredible production and art design was awe-inspiring. If what the actors said ranged from pretentious to pseudo-meaningful, everything on and around them was spectacular. The costumes, makeup, sets, props, and special effects were first rate. But then, suddenly, the movie takes a Damnation Alley turn in its last sixty secconds. Just outside the city is the most beautiful acreage this side of Shangri-La. Rolling hills and lush foliage abound without pollution in sight. The amazing stupidity of this finale, where Deckard says that everybody has to die sooner or later so he could live with Rachael's automatic termination, negates all the rich attention to detail that went before.

Although the audience was pinned to their seats, they had to consult among themselves to decide what the scenes they just saw did.

" Blade Runner Replicated." The Laser Disc Newsletter , 58 June 1989: 6. Review of The Criterion Collection CLV laser disc. When you are introduced to an adult character in the beginning of a movie you naturally presume the character has had a life leading up to the first moment you see him, but what if that wasn't the case? Such was the premise of Blade Runner before the film's producer chickened out. Harrison Ford's character, Deckard, was to have been a robot, and the first shot of him, it would probably have been implied later, was actually his first experience in the world, although, because of implanted memories, he wouldn't realize it himself. Had that plot twist not been corrupted, the film could have been a true candidate for greatness, because, among other things it would have ignited a philosophical self-examination strong enough to support the dense special effects and other tomfoolery. Characters in movies really don't have pasts, and really do 'enter' into existence in the first shot they appear. Pratt, Douglas. "Do Disc Owners Dream of Letterboxed Sheep?" The Laser Disc Newsletter , 41 January 1988: 1 . Review of Voyager Company release of Blade Runner on laser disc. The movie was a failure in film houses, but was a hit, and has achieved a cult following, under the relaxed standards of home video. This is ironic, since it means that most who profess to enjoy the movie have only seen aobut half of it. . . . The print which Criterion has used, which is in wide screen format and is otherwise spotlessly replicated, has received director Ridley Scott's blessing as the official, final, intended version. It contains the snippets of eye and nose gouging violence, retains the narration and the why-doesn't-everybody-move-there trip to the north ending. The print is so sharp that you can make out the minute details in the models and matte paintings on the edges of the screen composition. The print is also so luscious that there is a tendency to stop the picture every 1000 frames or so (the disc is in CAV) and just gawk. No one is ever going to accuse Scott of embezzlement. The disc has been digitally encoded and almost as soon as the images start hitting you, the sound starts hitting you as well. (The analog track is noisier and not quite as impressive.) The Vangelis score seems like it is playing inside your head rather than outside, and the sound effects seem to be coming from everywhere. Each component is almost perfectly defined, with clear, rounded tones. The disc was pressed at 3M. Blade Runner is a work of science fiction by artists with varying levels of aptitude for the genre. The two things which infuriate us the most about the film are the insipid voice-over narration, which is totally unlike any of the other dialog and is condescending, and the date placed on the setting: 2019. . . . Why is the film so popular on home video? At its best, Blade Runner is poetry, an evocation of the future and some of the philosophical problems spurred by technology, set in a languid, repetitive, moody meter. It provides many futurist concepts, but not so many that the viewer is drowned in them. You can't see or hear everything no matter how many times you watch it. There are just too many details to savor. It is drenched in action and special effects, but more importantly, it drips with style, and viewers, desperate for anything which is unique and imaginative, lap it up. Preston, J.

If production design was all there was to a movie, Blade Runner would be a masterpiece. . . . But at the center of the film is a sloggy semi-coherent stalk-and-kill story that leaves one in a foul mood. Blade Runner is all dressed up with no place to go - but down. . . . The movie's story combines almost as many styles and associations as its look. . . . What's remarkable about all this is how stylistically unified this mishmash appears to be - Ridley Scott has seen the future and it's everything all at once. Punks with hair like cockatoos mingle freely and silently with Hare Krishnas and Japanese and business-suited Anglos; monoliths of steel stand side-by-side with neon-blazed fast-food noodle bars. . . . The way Harrison Ford plays him, Deckard is pretty blah from the start. His romantic longings for Rachael are so stunted and half-hearted that you wonder why he bothers. You get the feeling he'd get more of a sexual thrill self-administering the Voight-Kampff test. Without some detectable shifts in humanity between Deckard and the androids, the cast begins to resemble a corps of somnambulists. Everyone seems hung-over with fatalism. The violence that frequently crops up is particularly ugly because there's nothing precious at stake, in the filmmakers's view, humans and androids have merged into the same species. The actors, particularly Rutger Hauer, are used as icons of terror; their blankness is part of the terror. I think, that the best moments in Blade Runner are the ones of hollowed-eyed horror. . . . Blade Runner isn't cautionary, it's fatalistic. It says there's nothing to look forward to except soullessness and horror, and the filmmakers use bits-and-pieces of contemporary L.A. locations to indicate that the horror of the future is already with us.

The Atlanta Journal , 26 June 1982, pp. 23-24. Capsule review, 1 still. A techno-sensual triumph. Ridley Scott's movie is a '40s film noir in a futuristic setting where the only thing more constant than the rain is the advertising. Harrison Ford is a blade runner, i.e., a special cop in the year 2019, whose mission is to track down and kill replicants, highly evolved robots that are indistinguishable from humans. As wearily dead-pan as any Raymond Chandler gumshoe, Ford is a fine screen hero, but here he's oveshadowed by Rutger Hauer's searing performance as the leader of the replicants. The film's blend of hardware and hard-boiled dialogue emphasizes visuals rather than drama. But those visuals are themselves so awesomely dramatic, you literally can't take your eyes off this hellish world of neon and grime. It's pure future shock, cushioned by ragged remnants of our past and present. Robinson, David. "Not a Polish Joke Is Left Unturned." The Times. [London], 10 September 1982, p. 7. Review. It is very bitty, full of loose ends and unexplained references which make a simple tale (private-eye hero assigned to exterminate six humanoid robots who have revolted and turned terrorist) hard to follow. . . . Even if you question a future (AD 2019) where people still wear lounge suits with revers, read newspapers at lunch counters and have no more sense than to make robots in forms indistinguishable from themselves, the concept is striking. . . . Scene and story alike predict a gloomy future, envisioned out of the most ugly and violent aspects of city streets in our own times. The best thing by far ... is that it is accompanied by Clare Peploe's half-hour short Couples and Robbers. Roddick, Nick. "Film Reviews: Blade Runner ." Films and Filming [UK], No. 337 (October 1982): 34-35. Review, credits, 1 still. Blade Runner is a spectacularly nasty film whose final escape into something finer - "I didn't know how long we'd have together: who does?" asks Deckard as he flees the city with Rachael to the accompaniment of the film's only shots of daytime scenic beauty - is as hollowly uncon- vincing as the redemption-by-love at the end of Ken Russell's Altered States. The film is wholly - some might say admirably - committed to its meticulous nightmare vision. It will prob- ably do very well. Rushing, Janice Hocker and Thomas S. Frentz. "The Frankenstein Myth in Contem- porary Cinema." Critical Studies in Mass Communication 6, No. 1 (March 1989): 61-80. Analysis. Rachael acts with mechanical indifference during the first half of the story, when she thinks she is human, as if she were imitating how the people around her seem to her. When she begins to suspect that she is a replicant, however, she drops her condescending facade and begins to act humanely. . . . Although she can be seen as acting in a traditionally feminine manner with [Deckard] (to his "Say you want me," she replies, "I want you"), this submissiveness, we believe, is more appropriately interpreted as the hesitant uncertainty that accompanies trying out each aspect of her "new" identity as nonhuman. Russo, John. Making Movies: The Inside Guide to Independent Movie Production. New York: Dell Publishing, 1989. 97. Brief mention of Blade Runner. Nowadays a look is very important to the way a film is received. In a curious way, the industry</page><page sequence="33">Bibliography/5 1 is much more interested in filmmakers today than it used to be in the past. And part of the success of films like Flashdance and Blade Runner is their look, the filmmaking look - the lights, composition, editing. These are the things we admired in directors of the forties and fifties. Ryan, Desmond. "Movies: Blade Misses the Basics When it Comes to Plot." The Anchorage Times 15 August 1982, sec. M: 4. Review, 1 still. So much care has been lavished on this bizarre and very convincing vision of urban America in 2019 that what the film looks like has taken precedence over what happens in it. This proves a great pity since Blade Runner , is crammed with interesting and adult ideas and brims with the potential to be a truly memorable film. . . . The film offers an instance of a talented director who has much to say about where current trends in society are leading, but finds himself confined by the requirements of making a commerical adventure film for the currently bullish science-fiction market. What he has done is absorbing and exasperating - a film of adult themes locked inside a youthful format. . . . Throughout Blade Runner , Scott astutely makes the audience infer the state of things to come from these kinds of sly asides. Unfortunately, he adopts the same approach to the story development of a complex situation full of dramatic possibilities that go unrealized. ... In the end, Blade Runner is a film that confounds both the viewer and its own aspirations. It seems to be going somewhere and then stops dead in its tracks and takes a new direction that ignores what has gone before. The vagaries of the plot also put undue strain on Ford. It is hard for an actor, and he is a good one, to make much of a character in the midst of so much narrative confusion. He keeps tripping over loose ends. . "The Future Is Now for Sci-fi Actor." The Philadelphia Inquirer 4 July 1982, sec. L: 1, 11. Interview, 3 stills. Director Ridley Scott's film is visually brilliant and its narative incoherence is no fault of Ford's. . . . The trouble with Blade Runner is that Scott, who directed Alien and clearly knows how to tell a story, forgot to do it. This undermines the fine brooding portrayal of Deckard turned in by Ford. . . . Ford said, "I was more interested in the context of the part and what it says about the future to us now. It's full of subtle ideas." These mostly concern the relationship of man to the machines - in this case androids - he creates. "Deckard is dead inside, and what awakens him is the girl," he said.

In the ambition of its intentions and the cruelty of the disappointment it engendered, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner has no competition. Just as the skyscrapers tower over the teeming masses on the streets of Los Angeles of 2019, the visual aspects of the movie dwarf the people in it.

Review credits. In Blade Runner the narrative has almost literally drowned in the overpoweringly rainy nightmare vision of Los Angeles early in the 21st century. . . . Rumor has it that director Ridley Scott was fired at some point in the production, and a voice-over hastily tacked on in the plot-saving manner of Apocalypse Now . One can believe such crisis-ridden stories, and still remain fascinated by the weirdly original look of the film, and by some of its studied artificiality as '40s private-eye melodrama transposed to an ingeniously creepy world. . . . Blade Runner calls for something more in the way of intelligent romanticism, and Ford simply can't cut the mustard as a Bogart transplant. Nor does Sean Young's metallic chic as the replicant Rachael provide the heartfelt allure required in any romance with a hopelessly deadpan hero. Indeed everyone in the movie looks vaguely punkish, with the result that the hinted themes of conformism and discrimination lose their graphic point. Also, everyone seems so preoccupied with posing amid the cluttered compositions that there is never any feeling of interaction. . . . There are moments, however, when the ersatz '40s swing strains of the talented Vangelis create a mood of the very sweetest prefabricated melancholy. and Tom Allen. Review of Blade Runner. The Village Voice , 7 December 1982, p. 61. Capsule review. One is left to ponder how such a talented, neo-Renaissance filmmaker as Scott, one of few directors capable of leaving a personal imprint on a big-bucks tinker toy like Blade Runner , could be such a vapid storyteller. The answer seems to be his obsessive fetish for decor, but at least fetishes, while rarely emotionally satisfying, are as rare as an agent's tears in an age of high-investment packages. Scheuer, Steven H., ed. Movies on TV 1984-1985. New York: Bantam Books, 1986. 71. Capusle review. Noisy, tiresome, often violent futuristic adventure patterned after the private eye action genre. Harrison Ford stars as the man assigned to hunt down and destroy "replicants," robots created in the 21st century to work "off-world," but who return to Earth as killers. Naturally one is a beautiful woman with whom Ford becomes involved. The story is pretty much at a comic strip level. Scheuer, Steven H., ed. Movies on TV and Videocassette 1989-1990. New York: Bantam Books, 1989. 77. Capusle review (rated excellent). Superbly crafted sci-fi, which invests a remarkable storyline with a distinctly noirish visual style and the seventies high-tech look. Ford is a "blade runner" (bounty hunter) out to terminate four escaped androids who are thought to be dangerous. Impeccable in every detail, from casting to scripting to the unforgettable look at a future where machines havee a truer sense of soul than humans do. (Cf. Scheuer' s 1984-1985 review).

One of the most interesting surprises that one immediately notices upon seeing the entire Panavision frame is how cinematographer Jorden Cronenweth frames his characters either screen left or screen right - rarely centered. This aesthetic is reinforced by lighting design that places the characters half in light, half in shade. Metaphorically speaking, this motif gives one the impression that all concerned are living their lives on the fringe - an existence that is perpetually off-balance. This transfer of Blade Runner makes an excellent case for the idea that when a portion of the frame has been left empty, it may be intentionally so. What the earlier pan and scan edition eliminated was the film's pervasive sense of isolation and alienation. By eliminating the "dead space," the characters wound up center screen, thereby removing this sense of solitude. Shipman, David. A Pictorial History of Science Fiction Films. Middlesex [UK]: Hablyn Publishing, 1985. 157-160. Synopsis, commentary, 3 stills. [Deckard] cannot be sure whether any of his helpers are replicants, leading him on before killing him. He is involved in a number of death-defying battles which are tremendously exciting and if they, like the plot, do not really convince except in terms of myth that is neither here nor there. Half the time there is no valid reason for any of the characters being where they are; and if Ford has a 'Dragnet' type commentary that only emphasizes the various styles, plots and genres plagiarized. The film is all effect and no narrative, like the many close-ups of rivulets of rain. And what are we to make of the hints of bisexuality - as opposed to asexuality - in the male and female replicants? Shorey, Kenneth. "The Future As Past: Seeing Tomorrow with Yesterday's Eyes." The Birmingham News , 1 July 1982, sec. D: 6. Review, 3 stills. Blade Runner is narrated in deadpan, Raymond Chandlersque voice-over by Deckard in the style of some of the old private-eye pictures. The effect of this against the futuristic visuals is striking. . . . And, of course, the resonantly eerie music of Vangelis holds everything together. . . . Certainly it creates strong, dramatic moods when heard against the visuals. . . . Blade Runner is one of the most interesting, original, imaginative and exciting movies I have ever seen. I can't recommend it, though, to casual, non-serious moviegoers: Lightweight, escapist entertainment it is not.</page><page sequence="36">54/Bibliography Siegel, Joel. E. "Critics Choie e:B lade Runner." City Paper [Washington, D.C.], 12-18 April 1985, p. 20. Review. Dismissed by most reviewers when first released in 1982, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner has developed a huge cult over the past 2 1/2 years and now, seems to be shaping up as one of the key American films of this decade. It is a flawed picture, but most of its shortcomings stem from post-production tampering by the Ladd Company . . . According to industry gossip, director Scott was taken off the picture after completing the first cut. Sneak preview audiences were reportedly confused by the film, so it was reçut, an intrusive narration was added, and Scott's unhappy ending was replaced . . . But Scott's vision is so masterful, his film manages to survive all of the tampering . . . most unforgettable is the film's distinctive production design - a totally original mixture of high-tech and contemporary sleaze. .

I've seen Blade Runner twice and have tried for three weeks to come to terms with it. . . . It's easy enough to pinpoint the film's flaws. . . . Yet I don't think I've ever been as spellbound at the movies as I was during both viewings of Blade Runner. . . . Even while my mind was rejecting Blade Runner , my eyes were popping at the film's splendors, and so I want to recommend it very strongly. And not as dumb fun, either. . . . The eye has its own intelligence: we don't leave our minds at home when we visit a museum or art gallery. I've never seen an exhibition of paintings as exciting or original as the images contained in Blade Runner , and so I'm recom- mending it for intelligent people to see and enjoy. One wishes the rest of the film lived up to the grandeur of its surface, but Scott and his crew have given us a visual banquet, something to be grateful for. Silverberg, Robert.

To me they embody the highest virtue the science fiction film can offer: They show the way the future looks, and they show it with such conviction, such richness of detail, such density of texture that the visions of tomorrow they offer will remain embedded forever in my imagination. They have provided a kind of time-travel experience, in a sense, and they have done it so well that I am willing to ignore entirely the manifest failure of both these movies in most other aspects.

" Blade Dulled by Lack of a Sharp Story." Chicago Tribune , 25 June 1982, Weekend: 3. Review, credits, 1 still. Blade Runner, a grim sci-fi adventure set in the near future, looks terrific but is empty at its core. What's missing? For starters, how about a story. . . . It's a great, albeit depressing, look, and that's the essence of the movie, save for a couple of fights. ... A simple story overpowered by the special effects and the set design. What we long for are more scenes between Ford and Young; instead, again and again, we are at that bar with Ford or we watch him examine photographs in a bedroom. No one moves very quickly in the film. . . . Here, in what is essentially a sci-fi film noir, Scott is stressing a look more than character. Skorman, Richard. Off-Hollywood Movies: A Film Lover's Guide. Harmony Books: New York. 1989. 69-70. Review, brief credits. Blade Runner is a futuristic film noir that takes place in Los Angeles in 2019. Undercover cop Deckard (Harrison Ford) is assigned to find and destroy renegade Replicants, androids who are virtually indistinguishable from normal humans, but who are responsible for many murders throughout the city. Hard-bitten and cynical, Deckard displays a knack for tracking and killing them. But when he falls in love with a beautiful woman (Sean Young) who may be a Replicant, Deckard becomes an increasingly vulnerable target for these Replicants who want to dispose of</page><page sequence="37">Biblio^raphy/55 this threat to their existence. The plot of Blade Runner is a typical love story mixed in with the "stop the androids before they kill innocent people" theme prevalent in many science fiction movies. Ford gives a good dramatic performance, and Rutger Hauer ( Soldier of Orange ) is particularly sinister as one of the most powerful Replicants. But what's best about Blade Runner is the atmosphere, not the action. Writer/director Ridley Scott (Alien) has created a world unlike any you have ever experienced. This Los Angeles of the future is heavily polluted, and the noise level is at times deafening. Tall buildings dominate most of the airspace, billboards clutter the rest. Technology has invaded every crevice of this society, and privacy is a thing of the past. Blade Runner is an Orwellian prophecy if there ever was one, and Scott's cinematography and set design bring it to life in remarkable ways. Even if you don't typically enjoy science fiction action movies, Blade Runner is worth it for Scott's and writer Philip K. Dick's prophetic vision of what our society can become. Sobchack, Vivian.

This new sense we have that everything in our lives is mediated and cultural explains, perhaps, why Deckard and Rachel's [sic] escape into the "natural" landscape at the end of Blade Runner seems so implausible and artificial. The landscape seems completely imaginary - unnatural in its "naturalness," its lack of the "real" social density we have previously experienced. Thus, the "nature" of cinematography strikes us an inauthentic "special effect" compared to the technical special effects we have seen and accepted as authentically "natural." Sofia, Zoe.

The most common familial dyad in SF film is father and daughter. From Rotwang's Maria in Metropolis , and Dr. Morbius' daughter Alta in Forbidden Planet , to Rachael, the replicant, brainchild of the Tyrell corporation in Blade Runner , as well as the unnamed feminine cyborgs of advertising, we regularly encounter Athena figures onto whom the father/scientist's interests have been projected and who can be understood as the reworked and animated remains of the cannibalized mother (also Mother Nature).

Rolling Stone , 5 August 1982, pp. 33-34. Review, credits, 1 still. Empathy is precisely what Ridley Scott lacks as a director. . . . Scott never clarifies the riddle at the center of the plot: Deckard must figure out how these renegade replicants could have chosen to return to Earth, where they face fatal risks, rather than hide out on some far-flung planet. The drama gets so muddled that viewers may overlook the poignant answer: they seek out their earthly creator because they desperately hope he can extend their life span. . . . The most engaging theme is that our civilization will "progress" to the point where humans won't recognize their own kind ... the biggest failure, as well as the biggest accomplishment, is probably Scott's. He's transformed what could have been a horrifying, touching tale of the android within us all into a visual extravaganza best suited for zombies. Stack, Peter. " Blade Runner Has a Dull Edge."

Review of Blade Runner. San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle , 11 July 1982, Arts and Entertainment: 4. Capsule review. A disjointed, implausible sci-fi film ... so trapped in fancy photographic maneuvers that it's lifeless. Harrison Ford is a caricature of the hardboiled detective, assigned to run down and gun down rebellious "replicants" - genetically engineered people who resent their slave status and short lifespans. It all leads up, very very slowly to a violent showdown between Ford and Rutger Hauer, who, as a replicant with a flash of nobility, has the only good moments in the film. Artist Douglas Trumbull's fascinating vision of Los Angeles ca. 2020 is more lively than any of the characters. Stephens, Bob. "Letters: More Bad Discs." Videofax 4, No. 8 (Spring 1988): 10-1 1.

"The love scene was the toughest, though we didn't really make love. You see us just before, sort of premaking love, in a ritual of violent foreplay. It's a scene about a virgin losing her virginity, a woman without experience being endowed with emotions, forcibly - it's really a wild scene. He makes me love him. He touches me, tries to kiss me. I'm totally freaked out, and I run to the door. But he gets there first and slams it. I back up, he grabs me, throws me against the wall and tells me to say I love him. I've never done that before; I don't know the meaning of love - but I want to. He teaches me, step by step, what love is. He teaches me to kiss him, to say the words. I begin to cry; I'm completely torn up. He unbuttons my dress - and we slowly sink out of the frame. Sterritt, David. "Walt Disney's TRON , The Ultimate Computer Movie."

Only a few scenes are marred by sadistic outbursts, but the movie as a whole is so relentlessly grim that the effect is multiplied. . . . For the background, filmmaker Scott and his colleagues have created a meticulously realistic setting - a damp, overcrowded, underpoliced Los Angeles - that seems true down to the last detail. On the level of sheer craft, it's a fabulous achievement. . . . But the plot is ordinary, and the scenarists have undermined it with narration that even Ford considers foolish, judging from the way he reads it. Too bad the filmmakers didn't try to recapture the modest virtues of the Dick novel, which (despite many flaws of its own) has a humor and humanity that are nowhere felt in Blade Runner. Put it all together, and it doesn't add up to much excuse for the vicious violence that breaks out increasingly as the final fade-out nears. Stracznski, Michael. "Falling in with Sean Young."

With its final scene, Blade Runner exorcizes the Nazi ghost; replicant and bounty hunter, after an attenuated struggle, recognize a fragile alliance in the brevity of their existence. Dick saw this as the expression of another of his novel's concerns - "the tragic theme that if you fight evil, you will wind up becoming evil, and this is the condition of life" - but an added complexity is infused by Ridley Scott's view of the story. Scott conceived the Tyrell Pyramid originally as the tomb of the mogul geneticist, the "father" of the replicants. It was to be revealed that the "live" Tyrell was in fact android, and that the human remains were in pharaonic preservation at the heart of the building, awaiting a time when the same research that was producing ever-improved replicants would at last come up with the secret of an indefinitely extended lifespan.</page><page sequence="39">Bibliography/57 Strick, Philip.

Dissatisfied with an early sneak preview, the Ladd Company reportedly wanted Blade Runner's running time trimmed and narration added to advance the story. Although Rawlings considers Blade Runner to be a "deeper document than other SF films," he remains bitter over the studio's "meddling." Blade Runner was a very complicated film from the very beginning," he says. . . . "Cut were scenes and subtleties that weren't terribly important to the movie, but still built tremendous character. For instance, in the scene with Deckard at the piano looking at the photographs, he originally begins drifting off to a misty forest where a unicorn is running around. But then people would ask, 'What does the unicorn mean?' All you can say is nothing - because it doesn't mean anything, it just does something for the characters." The cumbersome Ford narration is also a sore point for Rawlings. ... "I didn't like the idea of narration at all. Ridley wasn't happy with it either. But since the film was complicated, some felt we had to lead them through the maze. The narration could have worked if it took a different approach. It had to be from inside Deckard so that the audience would have understood him better and learned why he was pissed off at life." Tomblin, Damon. "Reaction."

(This might explain why the number of renegade Replicants supposedly on the loose seems to vary as the film progresses.) And apart from the recutting, and the added, unnecessary voice-over, a new ending was inserted. In the original version it ended on an ambiguous note with Deckard and Rachel (sic) entering the elevator; the revised ending is more upbeat with them flying off over the countryside while Deckard's voice-over informs us that Rachel (sic) (Sean Young) isn't doomed to die prematurely after all - which is totally at odds with everything we've been told about the Replicant physiology. But for all its flaws Blade Runner is a superior sf film. Winstein, Archer. "Shoot'em up Runner Mostly Gory Kid Stuff. New York Post , 25 June 1982, p. 45. Review.

Essentially surreal but old-fashioned hash . . . that substitutes mere incoherence for Dick's hallucinatory visions. . . . Vangelis's pulsing electrono-romantic score drowned out half the dialogue, but the Bogart-monotone voice-over narration, copped from a forties detective movie, is an audible reminder of a failure not only artistic, but even narrative: As usual with Hollywood's new sci fi films, the freshness of the vision is smothered under a desperate attempt to dude up a familiar format in spiffy new futuristic clothing, the art direction, however, deserves an Oscar for the stirring, squalid splendor of the sets. . . . Scott's films always look great, but this one has more beauty than brains. Wood, Robin. "Hollywood and the Other." Canadian Forum 63, (July 1983): 41-42. Article. Easily the most distinguished Hollywood film of 1982 . . . special effects and art direction are put to work for a serious and valid purpose ... the film's distinction lies primarily in its disturbing and audacious embodiment of Otherness in the form of the "replicants ". . . . There is another, related, issue: the difficulty of Blade Runner' s narrative, acknowledged by the studio before the film's release in their panicky dubbing-in of an incongruous and superfluous first-person narration a la Philip Marlowe. E.T. (like Spielberg's previous films) offers a skillful but resolutely traditional handling of classical narrative. Every stage in the action is carefully prepared and signalled, every enigma fully resolved. The viewer is guided through the film step by step. Blade Runner , on the contrary, demands an active reading, an audience that is prepared to think. . . . European films are expected to be difficult, Hollywood films are not. The kind of "originality" recurrently applauded by Pauline Kael or Jay Scott usually turns out to be a knowing trendiness, the very latest chic which the critic can pride her/himself on recognizing. The critical establishment has shown itself thoroughly complicit in choices that do not augur well for the immediate future of the American cinema. Woodward Byerly, ed.

Rachael, however, is not pleased; she challenges Deckard's right to "look" at her. She wants to know if Deckard hasever taken the test himself, or misread the test and killed a human by mistake. Thus Rachael pinpoints the burden of responsibility on the looker to see correctly - yet another derision of the blade runner's presumption, and of the viewer's. . . . The generous Rachael, like her Old Testament namesake, stands for an alternative direciton of technological aspiration. Her escape like Deckard represents a metaphorical possibility of revised positioning within the world that man is creating. Though it is, after all, only a romantic note of hope, a passage back from hell. Fancher, Hampton. Blade Runner [screenplay]. 24 July 1980. Deckard kills Rachael at the end. [ and David Peoples].

Paper presented at the Popular Culture Association Convention in Toronto, 29 March 1984. The figures folded by Gaff compromised their own progression, ending with a unicorn, a creature as fantastic as a love affair between a blade runner and a replicant. And at the ending, Deckard's escape with Rachael, seems dreadfully contrived and out of tone with the rest of the film; but while it doesn't work intellectually, it's the emotional ending we want.

Paper presented at the Science Fiction Research Association annual conference, June 1983, Mt. Plesant, Michigan. After four years, planned obsolescence sets in and the robots automatically kick the genetically degenerating bucket, so why are they such dangerous threats? Why go after them at all? And why should the companies who created such beings implant them with such human-like drives and motivations in the first place? Wouldn't it be simpler for everyone concerned if the replicants weren't quite so emotional and idealistic? The novel can adroitly sidestep these questions because the author has crammed his sketchy suspense-story plotline with plausible and conceptually-in- tegrated details about daily life in a post-apocalyptic society. For the viewer of the film, however,</page><page sequence="43">Bibliography/61 all these inconsistencies are glaringly apparent, because the director takes so long in establishing the suitably depressing atmosphere that there's nothing much else to do as you watch the camera glide along the same crumbling cityscape miniatures over and over again.

Except for video display screens along the wall, Holden's room looks more like a crypt than a hospital. The scene reveals a very human side to Deckard and a wry sense of humor. There's a close rapport between the two and Holden is doubtful that the V-K will detect a Nexus-6. He tells Deckard the Nexus-6 is so life-like that, during an autopsy of oné killed breaking into Tyrell's, it took more than three hours before someone realized the subject wasn't human. Scott deleted the scene because the essential information had already been communicated by Bryant. . "Script to Screen: Blade Runner in Perspective."

As they escape the city, Deckard glances at his dashboard display and sports Gaff in hot pursuit. Deckard put the tinfoil unicorn on his dash and from previous clues such as his final rooftop exchange with Gaff, Deckard realizes that he, Batty, and Rachael are replicants - "made for this world."

What if an adult character had no previous history or life before the point in time shown at the beginning of the movie? That was the premise of Blade Runner before the filmmakers panicked in the face of cost overruns and altered the story to fit a more conventional format. By turning Harrison Ford's character, Deckard, into a human, the filmmakers compromised on the potential for placing Blade Runner high in the pantheon of cinema. If Deckard 's 'life' had actually been depicted as the length and essence of an action film, the movie could have added a strong metaphysical resonance. It could have encouraged argument concerning the "life" of a film itself, and the entertainment, functioning as a conduit for such philosophical questions, would have seemed more vital.
