( From the Department of Plant Physiology and Pathology, Imperial College and Science and Technology , London .) With Plate IX and two Figures in the Text. EARLIER cultural characteristics papers in this produced series (7 and directly 8) have by environmental dealt with changes change. of cultural characteristics produced directly by environmental change. Such are usually described as modifications, and it is assumed that they are of a purely temporary nature, so that when the fungus is restored to its original environment its characters likewise revert to the original. Changes of a more lasting nature may be conceived as arising gradually as a response or adaptation to certain growth conditions, or by sudden jumps. The latter type of phenomenon, which is known to occur in a considerable number of fungal genera, and is usually described as a 4 mutation ', or more con- servatively as a 'saltation', also occurs freely in certain circumstances in the present group of forms. These will be considered later in the present paper. Changes of the former type are more difficult to prove or disprove, as from the nature of the case they are small and perhaps only demonstrable after the cumulative effect of a series of reculturings. The effects, if they exist at all, are more likely to be of a quantitative than of a qualitative nature, and their demonstration will in general depend on a comparison of cultures of a certain date with those, it may be, of years before. Even with the most careful system of notetaking, such a comparison is not always easy, and it may not be possible to draw convincing conclusions. The best that one can do may be to record a general impression that the fungi have diverged in a certain direction from the form exhibited some time previously. It is obvious, of course, that comparisons at different times must be carried out under standardized conditions, and this, in the case at any rate of highly variable forms such as these Fusarium strains, necessitates the use of synthetic media. Ordinary decoctions such as potato agar are too variable in composition to be of any use for this purpose. [Annals of Botany, Vol. XL. No. CLVII. January, xga6.]</page><page sequence="2">224 W. Brown . - Studies in the Genus Fusarium. IV. With a view to producing some definite evidence as to whether any change was taking place in the course of the routine culture of these Fusarium strains, a twofold series of tests was carried out. On the one hand, a careful determination of the growth curves of a number of strains under standardized conditions was made at a certain date, and after a some- what lengthy interval of culturings the curves of growth were determined anew for the same strains under the same conditions, and a comparison instituted. In the other series of experiments a number of strains very similar to each other, but differing in certain particulars, were grown on a standard medium and a careful note made of the differences shown between them. At subsequent periods the same comparisons were made and evidence obtained as to whether they- were changing their properties relatively to each other. In these experiments, as well as in the whole of this work, the stock cultures were renewed at intervals of about six to eight weeks on a standard synthetic medium, and at each renewal spores were used when- ever available. As all the strains used in the particular experiments under consideration sporulate more or less freely, the stocks were recultured from spores in every case. Throughout all this work the cultures of every strain have been carried on at one time or other from a single spore or its equivalent - more frequently from a single hyphal tip. As will be pointed out later, extreme precautions were taken to ensure freedom from ad- mixture in these strains, and the majority of them have been repeatedly subjected to the process of renewal by carrying on from a single hyphal tip. The standardized growth tests were carried out with four strains, A, F, C3, and D, which were chosen for this purpose because of the writer's familiarity with their general cultural features. As media the following strengths of the standard synthetic medium were used : aN, 3N/2, N, N/a, N/3, N/4, N/5, where N represents the standard medium.1 The less staling strains, A and F, were grown on the series of media 2N-N/3 and the more strongly staling strains, C3 and D, on the series of media N- N/5. The cultures were incubated at ao° and the diameters of the colonies measured at about two-day intervals. Fig. I gives the curves obtained at the first determination, which took place in October 192a, and Fig. II those obtained when the test was repeated during March/April 1924. In both figures the various concentrations of the medium are spaced at equal dis- tances along the #-axis, while the ordinates represent the diameters of the colonies at the various intervals. A comparison of Figs. I and II brings out very strikingly the similarity in behaviour of the various strains after an interval of nearly a year and a half. Strain A in both cases shows the least degree of 1 Composition : glucose, 2 grm. ; asparagin, 2 grm. ; neutral potassium phosphate, 1*25 grm. ; magnesium sulphate, 0*75 grm. ; agar, 15 grm. ; water, 1 litre.</page><page sequence="3">W. Brown . - Studies in the Genus Fusarium. IV. 225 staling, and the other strains follow in the order F, C3, and D. The difference in staling capacity between strains C3 and D is slight, and is only shown by the fact that the latter stales on the medium N/s, whereas the former does not. This feature is shown strikingly in both figures. The only difference between the growth curves in the two figures consists in the slightly slower growth of all the strains in the case of the later determination. A slight variation in the temperature of the incubator is probably respon- sible for this, as it is known from other determinations that there is no evidence that the intrinsic rate of growth of these strains is tending to fall off. It was pointed out in the earlier papers of this series that the degree of staling shown is correlated with certain other cultural features, e. g. the amount of mycelium, amount and distribution of sporing, degree of septation of the spores, &amp;c. The fact that the staling features of these strains have not changed is presumptive evidence that those characters which are correlated with staling have also remained unaltered. When to this one adds the general impression that these strains behave now as formerly, there are considerable grounds for the statement that they have not changed in any material respect in consequence of the routine cultural methods adopted. In the second series of experiments a number of closely similar strains derived as saltants from the original strain A were used. Comparisons were made of the cultural appearances of these strains on two media, (1) the standard synthetic medium, (%) the same modified by the addition of i per cent, potato starch and by reduction of the asparagin content to o'oa per cent. The object of the latter medium was to test the colour reactions of the strains. The eight strains tested differ from each other chiefly in the amount of sporulation and of aerial mycelium formation on the standard medium and in the amount of yellow colour production on the medium modified as described above. The kind of differences shown will appear more clearly from the following table : Table. Strain . Appearance on Standard Medium . Colour .

The stock cultures of these strains were kept as usual in tubes of the standard synthetic medium, and tests were made in plate cultures at the following times : in December 1923, February 192 |, June 1924, and February 1925. The description given in the table was found to be true at each examination, with the single exception of strain A3 at the last date mentioned. Here the well-known radial or sectored appearance was shown, indicating that saltation had taken place at some period of the reculturing process, so that the culture was now mixed. Strains A4 and A5 from the beginning were so similar as only to be doubtfully different, and one of them might well have been discarded. However, it was decided to keep both for purposes of the present test in order to see if they diverged in any way. No such effect has taken place. The interest of the present experiment lies in the proof afforded of the fact that strains, some of which only show slight differences from each other.1 can be main- tained as such if suitable cultural methods are adopted. As has already been stated, spore inocula were always used, when available, for the process of routine reculture. However, some of the strains sporulate so feebly that mycelial inocula, composed either of aerial mycelium or of mycelium with a portion of the substratum, had in some cases to be used. It was decided to carry through a series of experi- ments to determine whether any variation of a more or less permanent nature could be produced by the selective use of different kinds of inocula. Special attention was directed to a comparison of cultures derived from spore inocula with those from mycelial inocula, with a view to determining whether in the latter case the strain tended to lose its sporulating capacity : an effect which appears to take place in the case of some fungi, especially of those which have pycnidial or perithecial fructifications. The following account of a particular experiment will illustrate the method. Strains A and C3, when grown on the standard synthetic medium, sporulate strongly, especially when cultured in the light. When the glucose concentration of the medium is raised to 8 per cent., and when the cultures are grown in the dark, the former strain produces sporeless colonies, while those of the latter are nearly so. A parallel series of reculturings was therefore carried out with both strains, in the one case on the standard medium in the light via spores at each transfer, and in the other on the medium reinforced with glucose in the dark via mycelium at each transfer. The strains were in this way carried down through six reculturings at fortnightly intervals. At the end of the period transfers of spores in the one case and of mycelium in the other were made to the standard medium 1 It may be pointed out that the strains described in the table on p. 225 constitute a series, ranging from an almost completely mycelial form (A7) at one end to forms devoid of aerial mycelium and more or less covered with a layer of spores at the other end. The colour effects are also arranged in series, being slight at both ends of the series and strong in the middle.</page><page sequence="7">W. Brown. - Studies in the Genus Fusarium. IV. 229 and all the colonies grown side by side in the light. The results were slightly different in the case of the two strains. Strain A . There was no difference whatever between the cultures which had been treated as described above. Strain C3. A certain amount of difference did appear. The colonies derived from the mycelial transfers showed a slight but at the same time consistent reduction of staling capacity as compared with those which had been recultured through spores. Again, the former lagged behind the latter in the replacement of aerial mycelium by spores, so that for a time the colonies derived from mycelium showed a less sporulating capacity. After a time, however, this difference practically disappeared, and when in the next generation spores were taken from the two series the colonies pro- duced were identical. Further experiments showed that the same kind of difference could be obtained between spore and mycelial inocula without the process of selective reculturing described above. This strain in fact, as contrasted with strain A, illustrates the case where there is a slight intrinsic difference between spore and mycelial inocula, the colonies pro- duced not being quite identical in the two cases. The difference, however, is small, and there is no evidence that the process of repeated selective culturing intensifies it. Also the difference so produced disappears at once when similar inocula are taken. A large number of tests has been made from time to time on the question of a possible difference between spore and mycelial inocula with a number of other strains, especially with a strain D, which, as will be shown later, can be made to saltate freely and produce widely different permanent strains. When grown on the standard medium this strain typically shows a pustule of spores in the centre of the colony, then a zone devoid of spores, and beyond that a strong ring of spores. The central pustule of spores is variable in size and is frequently absent. Also in some cases a certain amount of diffuse sporulation occurs over the general surface of the colony. Attempts to correlate these variations with the nature of the inoculum, whether of spores or of mycelium, failed ; mycelial inocula were found to give the more strongly sporing colonies as often as inocula consisting entirely of spores. Thus in this strain, though there is a certain amount of unexplained variation, there is no definite difference between the potentialities of spore and mycelial inocula. All the strains that have been tested behave similarly to one or other of the ones described. Thus it appears that any intrinsic difference between spores and mycelium, from the point of view of the colonies to which they give rise, is non-existent, or at the best of negligible amount. In the present connexion, comparisons were also made between spores derived from media of widely different composition. The tests were</page><page sequence="8">230 W. Brown, - Studies in the Genus Fusarium . IV . carried out with modifications of the standard synthetic medium. The following illustration will suffice : Strain A was grown on two media, one with very low and the other with very high* asparagin content. The colonies produced on the medium with low asparagin content developed after some days a strong yellow colour throughout the medium, while those on the medium with high asparagin remained colourless. When the colonies were two months old, spores were transferred from each to a medium with low asparagin content, in order to determine whether any loss of colour-producing capacity had taken place as a result of cultur- ing on the medium with high asparagin content. The spores derived from the latter medium were slower in germinating than those from the other, an effect which can be described as attenuation due to the liberation of ammonia in the cultures with the high asparagin content. The resultant colonies were therefore, throughout their growth, somewhat behind the others in area, and the appearance of the yellow colour was delayed by about two days. The final result was, however, identical in the two cases. From these results, ' therefore, it appears that in the case of these Fusarium strains the physiological state of the inoculum has little or no effect on the appearance of the resulting fungal colony, and that new strains are not likely to be produced by selective culturing of the type above considered. While there is little evidence of any slow progressive changes arising in the course of the culture of these organisms, changes of the sudden type known as 4 mutations ' or ' saltations ' have been met with a considerable number of times. The remainder of this paper will be taken up with a consideration of these results. That saltations do occur in monospore cultures ot fungi has been definitely established by a number of investigators. Thus Crabill (11), working with Coniothyrium pirinum , found that a certain strain was liable from time to time to throw a new one, which in subsequent culture remained always different from the parent, and showed no signs at any time of reversion to the original. This saltation was accompanied by a very con- siderable change in the morphology of the fungus, e. g. the parent form possessed numerous unilocular pycnidia, while the saltant had few multi- 1 ocular pycnidia. Stevens and Hall (18) record a radial appearance in cultures of Ascochyta chrysanthemi . This appearance suggests the occurrence of saltation, but apparently no means were taken to ensure the isolation of the two strains, and subsequent recultures behaved in an unintelligible manner. Chaudhuri (10) describes a saltation in a species of Colletotrichum which differed from the parent in its colour reactions, and in the size, distribution, and abundance of sclerotia produced. The saltant maintained its properties on certain media, but in some cases, as on potato mush agar, it reverted to the original form.</page><page sequence="9">IV. Brown. - Studies in the Genus Fusarium . IV. 231 Burger (9) in a study of some naturally occurring forms of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides found that several of these saltated in course of culture, and gave in some cases forms indistinguishable from naturally occurring varieties. The sectored appearances in culture, as figured by Burger, show a strong resemblance to what has been met with in the present study of Fusarium. Brierley (2) records the sudden appearance in a culture of Botrytis cinerea of a strain with white instead of the normal black sclerotia. This new strain kept constant in culture. The fullest account of the occurrence of this saltation phenomenon is given by Stevens (17) in a paper dealing with the culture of Helmititko- sporium sativum. Practically any cultural feature was found to undergo sudden change in this way. Some of the saltants proved to be very stable in culture, while others were very variable. Occasionally a saltant reverted to the original. No evidence was found of a change of parasitic power arising by saltation, but this question was not examined critically. Stevens's results are very similar to those met with in the present study. Appel and Wollenweber (1), in an important memoir on the classifica- tion of Fusarium species, describe certain results which, as will be pointed out later, indicate that saltation was taking place, though the authors did not apparently recognize it as such. A study of fungal literature reveals numerous instances where saltation probably has taken place, but the above citations will suffice. The pheno- menon of saltation is not confined to fungi, but occurs freely among bacteria. The literature on this subject is summarized by Dobeli (12). Throughout the whole group of the fungi it is becoming increasingly known that a large number of species contain within their limits a con- siderable variety of strains. Good illustrations are to be found among species of Aspergillus (Thom and Church, 19), Glomerella (Edgerton, 13 ; Shear and Wood, 15), Rhizoctonia (Matsumoto, 14), Cladosporium (Brooks and Hansford, 5), Puccinia (Stakman and co-workers, 16), &amp;c. It is highly probable that in many cases some of these strains can be derived from others in artificial culture. During the course of this work, while the occurrence of saltations was being specially attended to, extreme precautions were taken to ensure the freedom of all the strains from admixture. At each renewal the stock cultures were transferred, first of all, to plates of plain agar, and from these hyphal tips were cut out by the technique described in an earlier paper by the writer (6). These hyphal tips formed the starting-point of the next series of stock cultures. This process was carried out at six-weekly intervals or thereabouts, over a period of fully one year, so that the strongest evidence was forthcoming that all the strains were each single mycelia. Whenever a saltant strain appeared, both the saltant and the parent strain</page><page sequence="10">232 W. Brown . - Studies in the Genus Fusarium . IV. were picked up and carried on, each from a single hyphal tip. This pre- caution, though necessary for guaranteeing freedom of each strain from admixture, is in many cases probably quite superfluous, since the ordinary process of transfer, as a rule, gives apparently pure colonies. It may be mentioned here that the group of Fusariums under con- sideration have one special feature which particularly recommends them for the study of saltation. That is, that they have no air-borne type of spore. The conidia are borne in wet masses, and do not blow about. Thus it is that not once in the course of thousands of culturings in Petri dishes has one of the strains appeared as an accidental contaminant in any of the dishes. The case of Pénicillium offers a pointed contrast in this respect. There is little doubt that saltations do occur in Pénicillium , but very special precautions would be required to guarantee that a radial or sectored appearance in a colony represented a genuine saltation, and was not due to the accidental falling in of a strange spore which happened to alight at a suitable spot in the neighbourhood of the growing edge of the colony. Saltations have occurred from time to time in an apparently accidental manner in the course of this investigation. Relatively to the number of cultures made, the number in which saltation appeared was insignificant. Later it was found that, by using a particular type of nutrient medium, saltations could be produced at will, especially in the case of certain strains as parents. Before dealing with these latter results, the general appearance of saltations, as they show themselves first in culture, will be illustrated by a discussion of the photographs reproduced in Plate IX. Fig. i illustrates the simplest type of saltation. The culture figured was on a medium favourable for colour production. The parent strain, which in the present case occupies the bulk of the culture, is characterized by fairly strong sporulation in sporodochia, and by intense formation of yellow colour. The saltant, which appears as a small diverging sector, with apex at some distance from the centre of the colony, is characterized by less staling capacity, by absence of the yellow colour, and by diffuse, somewhat feeble sporulation. The tendency of the saltant sector to increase at the expense of the parent is probably due to its smaller staling capacity. Whether the actual saltation took place at the apex of the sector, or whether the saltant was already present in the inoculum and only asserted itself at some distance from the centre, is a matter which cannot readily be determined. As will be pointed out below, appearances very similar to the present are shown in cases where the mixing of strains must have already existed in the inoculum, though the separation of the colony into distinct sectors did not take place until some distance from the centre. On the other hand, sectors have, in a few cases, been obtained in cultures of which the inoculum was a single hyphal</page><page sequence="11">W. Brown . - Studies in the Genus Fusarium. IV. 233 tip, in which case it appears highly probable that the actual saltation took place at or near the apex of the sector. In the case illustrated in Fig. i the probabilities are that the saltation took place during the growth of that particular colony, as this was the only one out of a batch of four which showed the effect. Fig. 2 shows an appearance very similar to Fig. 1, but with the important difference that the sector which occupies only a small portion of the colony is the parent form. In the duplicate plate the entire colony consisted of saltant. The colony figured here, as well as those of Figs. 3-7, developed from inocula taken from cultures on Richards s , solution agar, which were each planted with single hyphal tips. The strain which occupies the great part of the colony is an intensely sporing one, whereas the parent is of the mycelial type. It is obvious that in the present case a process of haphazard reculture would lead to the elimination of the parent form altogether. This statement applies a fortiori if, as is often the case, one uses spores wherever available for reculturing purposes. Infection experiments which are at present in progress in this laboratory show a very pronounced change in parasitic power in some of these saltants as compared with the parent, so that there is here a strong indication of the manner in which fungal cultures change their infective power. This point will be discussed more fully later. Fig. 3 illustrates the same relations as Fig. 2, except that the parent appears as three distinct sectors. Careful study of the photograph shows one, if not two, places where the parent strain is present, though it has failed to assert itself. Fig. 4 is similar to Fig. 1, except that the sector begins from the centre. The parent is a mycelial staling form. The saltant is a form which sporulates freely in sporodochia, and shows less staling reactions. In con- sequence of this it is tending to spread at the expense of the parent. Figs. 5 and 6 are similar to each other, and illustrate the case of an intensely sporing and strongly staling form appearing as saltant in a mycelial strain. The latter in both cases is apparently entirely sub- merged at the centres of the colonies, but in virtue of its less strongly marked staling reactions it is tending to cut off the saltant. Yarious stages in this process are shown in these figures. The two strains present in Figs. 5 and 6 are the same as in Figs. 2 and 3, and the different appear- ances are no doubt associated with the relative amounts of each strain present in the inocula, the parent form being presumably more represented in the case of Figs. 5 and 6. Fig. 7 is a more complicated case where there are at least three strains present. The parent mycelial strain occupies most of the right-hand side of the colony as figured, and also occurs as small areas between the saltant</page><page sequence="12">234 ^ Brown. - Studies in the Genus Fusarium . IV. sectors. The latter consist of an intensely sporing pionnotal form (pointing towards the upper left hand) and three sectors of a sporodochial strain (the sporodochia shown as dark spots on the photograph) which are spreading at the expense of the rest of the colony. Fig. 8 is similar to Figs. 5 and 6. The medium in this case is one suitable for colour production. The three radiating clear areas represent the saltant, which is characterized by pink colour and diffuse sporulation. The remainder, which is the parent, is almost devoid of spores and has a strong yellow colour. Figs. 9, io, and 11 illustrate complicated cases of saltation, in which the individual strains are not always clearly separated from each other. In Fig. 9 the colony covers the whole plate, and consists mainly of a form which sporulates thinly and diffusely. All this is saltant. Halt encircling the centre of the colony is a ring of sporodochia, and at a few places over the colony are isolated sporodochia. These belong to the parent form, and by careful transfer the latter was easily recovered from these. Fig. 10 is similar to the preceding. The groundwork of the colony is again the saltant, and the parent can be recovered from the scattered sporodochia or from the tufts of aerial mycelium showing here and there on the surface. Fig. ii is a complicated mixture. The colony covers the whole plate. A diffusely sporing form covers the central region, and runs out in a broad band to the margin. This is a saltant. Elsewhere the outer part of the colony is occupied by a faintly coloured form with occasional small sporodochia. This also is a saltant. Along the apparent junction of these two strains are a number of clustered sporodochia. These give the parent form. The diffusely sporing form which covers nearly the whole surface in the case of Figs. 9 and 10 and a considerable part of the surface in the case of Fig. 11 has, in contrast to the parent form, extremely weak parasitic powers on the apple fruit. It is obvious that haphazard reculture from these plates would certainly lead to elimination of the parasitic form, and to the carrying over of a purely saprophytic strain. It is suggested that some such effect as this takes place where, as often happens, it is reported that a parasitic fungus loses its virulence in culture. If what has just been described in the case of Ftisarium is at all general, the true facts are, not that the fungus has lost its virulence in culture, but that a saprophytic saltant has been substituted for the virulent strain. If sufficient atten- tion is given to the stock cultures, and especially if the appropriate type of medium is used, there does not seem to be any reason why parasitic strains should 'go off' in artificial culture. Suggestions will be put for- ward later in this paper as to the best means of ensuring stability in fungal cultures.</page><page sequence="13">VV. Brown . - Studies in the Genus Fusarium . IV. 235 It has been already mentioned that some saltants arose from time to time on a variety of media in the course of general cultural work. Later it was found that on certain media saltation took place very frequently in the case of certain strains. The medium which proved to be most suitable for producing saltations was Richards's solution agar.1 A considerable number of experiments were carried out with this medium along the following lines : A strain D was chiefly used in this connexion. A single hyphal tip was placed in the centre of a large Petri dish containing Richards's solution agar, and the colony allowed to grow at laboratory temperature in the light. To keep the colony free from air-borne contamination, the Petri dish was enclosed in a larger Petri dish. The developing colony was then sampled from time to time, i. e. pieces of aerial mycelium, or of spores, or of sclerotia, &amp;c., were transferred to plates of the standard synthetic medium and the identity of the strain determined from its appearance on the latter. On Richards' s solution agar, strain D forms a colony which covers the whole plate. As time goes on the mycelial weft thickens up to form a strong felty mass (plectenchyma), which becomes wrinkled and cracked over the central region especially. Here and there, in a quite irregular manner, irregular sclerotium-like bodies appear which become blue. Sporu- lation is in the form of sporodochia scattered sparsely and irregularly over the whole surface. In addition, spores appear in thin bands along the edges of the cracks of the mycelial weft ; there is invariably a zone of spores on the glass round the margin of the colony ; spores appear on the top of some of the sclerotia, and occasionally a broad effused area of spores may be shown. The centre of the colony is typically occupied by a large pustule of spores. The method of experiment consisted in taking inocula from different marked parts of the colony, planting these on plates of the standard synthetic medium, and observing what kind of colony developed. Later in the experiment the same regions of the colony were again tested, and the results compared with the earlier ones. Though there were no obvious saltations in the form of sectors in the parent colony, nevertheless it was found that inocula, whether of spores or of mycelium, taken from different marked spots of the parent consistently behaved differently from each other. Thus spores taken from one particular spot would consistently give a saltant usually mixed with the parent, while an apparently similar mass of spores elsewhere gave the parent only. As the parent culture increased in age, the percentage of spots which gave indica- tions of saltation tended to increase in number. The general results are ^ best illustrated by a particular example. 1 Composition : cane sugar, 50 grm. ; KNOs, 10 grm. ; KHaP04, 5 grm. ; MgS04, 7 HaO 2 «5 grm. ; iron salt, a trace ; agar, 15 grm. ; water, 1 litre.</page><page sequence="14">236 W. Brown . - Studies in the Genus Fusarium . IV' The parent colony was derived from a hyphal tip of strain D. Medium, Richards's solution agar. First sampling , after 11 days . Inocula were taken in the form of spores from the centre of the colony, of aerial mycelium from half-way to the growing edge, and of growing tips from the edge of the colony. All produced the parent strain only. Second samplings after 5 weeks . Again no trace of saltation was found. Third sampling , after 9 weeks . Out of fourteen spots tested, the parent strain came up pure in ten cases, in the remaining four a saltant was present. Fourth sampling , after 13 weeks . Twenty-one inocula were taken. Thirteen of these gave the parent, and eight gave saltant forms. Fifth sampling , after 1 7 weeks . Of eighteen inocula taken, eight gave the parent and ten gave saltants. These saltants were of course not all different from each other. In fact the same saltants appear consistently in the same place. Altogether in this experiment ten of the saltants were carried on as possibly being different from each other. These were purified by the hyphal tip method and then grown on a number of test media for purposes of comparison. Five of them proved to be definitely different from each other. A further test showed that two of these were identical with strains already got from the same parent, so that altogether the yield from this experiment was three new strains. This type of experiment had been carried out with strain D five times, with a similar result on each occasion. Other strains gave similar results, e. g. strains A, B, and Er Some strains give only one saltant, and the strain C3 gave none at all. This last strain is peculiar in that it frequently shows vague indications of the sectored appearance, especially on colour-producing media. Numerous attempts have been made to isolate a saltant from these sectors, but the result has been simply the parent in every case. This strain appears to be one of the most stable in the group. In the course of these tests a careful record was kept of the position on the parent culture from which the various inocula were taken, and a note was made of the nature of the inocula, whether composed of spores only, or of mycelium only, or of a mixture of the two. But only a limited amount of rule was made out in this connexion. As was to be expected, the intensely sporing form of saltant arises from spore inocula, and the sterile type of saltant from mycelial inocula. Thus, if saltation has taken place in the parent culture, selection of spore inocula will tend, if anything, to intensify sporulation, whereas by choosing aerial mycelium there is a risk that a sterile strain may be picked up. But except in such a suitable</page><page sequence="15">W. Brown . - Studies in the Genus Fusarium . IV. 237 object for showing saltation as strain D, and then only in old cultures, the majority of inocula, whether consisting of spores or of mycelium, give the parent only. In other words, the differentiation as between spores and mycelium considered as inocula has no necessary connexion with the development of new strains in culture. Of two apparently similar masses of spores, one would give the parent and the other a saltant. An attempt was made to relate the saltation effect with the nature of the underlying growth, whether loose mycelium, or plectenchyma, or Sclerotium, but no rule was manifested. The general conclusion is that on such a medium as Richards's solu- tion some of these strains, even when put on in the form of a single hyphal tip, develop into a heterogeneous colony, though there may be none of the sectored appearance showing. While the greater part consists of the parent type, small areas exist scattered over the surface, where apparently some kind of segregation has taken place, and from which one can readily pick up new strains. The latter are less likely to be found in young cultures, and, it may further be added, are more frequently met with in the central region of the culture than towards the periphery. In the light of the above results it seems hardly necessary to empha- size that, for fungi such as the Fusarium strains dealt with here, a medium like Richards's solution agar is highly unsuitable if the aim is to preserve the fungi in their original form. In the case of strain D grown on this medium it was found that in old cultures it was about an even chance whether a particular inoculum taken from it gave the parent in the pure form or the parent mixed with some saltants. It is obvious that in such circumstances the parent form will inevitably be lost in the course of a few siibculturings, and replaced by a saltant or a mixture of them. This will be accompanied in some cases by a very distinct change in the physiological and pathological reactions of the organism. For the purpose of producing saltants, Richards's solution agar has proved to be the most serviceable, that is, the actual number of saltants that were isolated from cultures on this medium proved to be greater than from, for example, potato mush agar, though this result may not have general application. On the other hand, ordinary potato extract agar (300 grm. potato to the litre) and still less the synthetic potato extract used by the writer are not suitable for producing saltants. In other words, the latter media are more suitable as stock media for preserving these strains. Saltations do occur on these media, but comparatively rarely. The follow- ing illustration is sufficient to emphasize this point : The strain A has been kept in culture since 191 9, for part of the time on potato extract agar and later on the synthetic medium. During that time many thousand plates of this strain have been examined in the course of physiological studies and only on three occasions has it shown the sectored appearance indicating</page><page sequence="16">238 W. Brown. - Studies in the Genus Fusarium . IV. saltation. Two of these saltants proved to be the same, so that altogether two new strains were obtained. On the other hand, a single culturing on Richards's solution agar in which the inoculum was a hyphal tip of strain A gave on analysis at least four new strains, all of which have since maintained their characteristic features when cultured on the synthetic modification of potato extract agar. As compared with the parent the various saltants may show intensifica- tion or reduction in respect of any particular feature, that is, saltation may take place in either direction. Thus the strain A, which on a certain medium gives moderate colour development, has as saltants the strain Av which forms no colour, and A2, which forms intense colour. Strain A on a certain medium forms little aerial mycelium, a saltant Ae forms none, another saltant A7 forms a considerable amount, and similarly in converse ratio with regard to intensity of sporulation. Strain A has weak staling reactions, the saltant Aļ has still less, whereas A7 stales strongly. Similarly the strain D, which sporulates moderately, has saltated into intensely sporing pionnotal forms and into strains which are almost sterile. Nevertheless, no case has been seen where, say, a strain I saltated to a strain II and the latter subsequently saltated back to I. Stevens, in the paper cited, records such cases, and the fact that fungi which have lost their parasitic power in culture can be restored by appropriate treatment to their original vigour is probably to be interpreted in this manner. In the present work, such reversions have not been sufficiently searched for, as most of the culturing on the Richards's solution medium was done with the original strains them- selves. Saltant strains have from time to time given other saltants, but these have always proved to be different from the original parent. The following case is worthy of mention: A strain which may be indicated as I saltated on two occasions, giving two different strains, II and III. The strain II itself subsequently saltated, giving a strain which was not definitely distinguishable from the strain III. Thus the original strain reached a certain result in one case by one jump, and in the other by an intermediate stage. An interesting physiological feature often seen when saltation is accompanied by the sectored appearance is that the cultural features of the strains are intensified at their junction. Fig. 2 of Pl. IX is an illustration of this effect. The bulk of the colony consists of a strain which forms a more or less continuous layer of spores over the surface ; the sector consists chiefly of aerial mycelium. Along the line where the strains meet there is a pronounced ridge of spores. Similarly, when the sectored appearance occurs on a medium which gives rise to colour formation, the intensity of the latter tends to be greatest in the neighbourhood of the junction of the strains.</page><page sequence="17">W. Brown. - Studies in the Genus Fusarium . IV. 239 General Discussion. A certain amount of discussion has taken place recently as to the nature, from the genetic point of view, of the phenomenon of saltation. In a number of recent addresses Brierley (3, 4) has dealt with this question in considerable detail. Brierley takes exception to the use of the term 4 mutation ' for this phenomenon, inasmuch as the criteria of purity which are usual in the study of the genetics of higher plants cannot as yet be applied to the case of fungi or bacteria. He considers that cases of so-called ' mutation * are simply segregations from a heterozygous parent. By a series of arguments based entirely upon analogy and with no definite experimental evidence pointing one way or the other, Brierley is led to suspect the presence of the heterozygous condition as more 01* less universal throughout the fungi. The chief argument for this contention is the known occurrence of sexual fusions in certain fungal groups, and of hyphal fusions in the mycelia of fungi generally. The latter fusions, according to this theory, are visualized as leading to a heterozygous condition in part of the mycelium, though in the present condition of mycological technique it has not been found possible to bring forward any evidence bearing on this point. The fact that these saltations occur freely among the bacteria in which no process of fusion of any kind has ever been observed offers considerable difficulties to the theory of ' heterozygousness ' difficulties which Brierley meets with a series of speculations still less capable of proof or of disproof than in the case of the fungi. Such being the case, it is not clear what useful purpose is served by speculative discussion of this type, which has no conceivable practical bearing on the study of mycological problems either at the present day or for many years to come. The genetic nature of the saltation effect being wholly unknown and perhaps unknowable, it is perhaps as well that the non-committal word ť saltation ' should have been coined (apparently by Stevens) for their designation, but the present writer is far from sharing in Brierley's alarm at the lamentable consequences which the unblushing use of the word ť mutation ' would entail to mycological science. It is obvious that this word has been used by mycologists and bacteriologists to crystallize what is the salient feature of these changes occurring in culture, viz. that they are sudden changes which are neither the result of a process of gradual acclimatization or 1 education ' nor of a mere sorting out of one strain from what was originally a mechanical mixture. Used in this sense, and this is the only sense in which the term ' mutation ' can be applied as yet in microbiology, no misconception need be feared. The relation of such 4 mutations ' to hypothetical changes in the chromatic material of nuclei, which latter in the case of bacteria have themselves little more than hypothetical existence, is a matter which does not seriously interest the practical student of fungi or bacteria.</page><page sequence="18">240 W. Brown. - Studies in the Genus Fusarium . IV. To most workers the interest of these phenomena lies in other directions. Saltations have a threefold interest. In the first place they directly concern the systematist. It is only by knowing the limits of varia- tion of a form and its saltants that the limits of the species can be mapped out. This has not been recognized in much descriptive work, and in conse- quence many forms have been described as species which more detailed work would in all probability show to be derivable from other forms by saltation. A way would thus be opened for a much-to-be-hoped-for reduction in the number of fungal species which are now listed and the number of which is constantly being added to. In the second place, the phenomenon of saltation is of great interest to the pathologist, inasmuch as saltant forms may differ markedly from the parent in respect of their virulence. The bearing of saltation upon epidemic outbreak of disease is thus obvious. Lastly, the question of the possibility of saltation in cultures of micro-organisms is one of very great practical importance to the biologist whose concern it is to study disease phenomena by the laboratory method. A few suggestions on the last-mentioned question, based upon the experience gained in the course of the present research, may fittingly cón- clude this discussion. The important point has been brought out in this work that the tendency of these Fusarium strains to saltate is a function of the cultural medium. On a weak glucose-asparagin- mineral salts medium saltation takes place quite rarely, so that with a moderate amount of attention the individuality of all the strains can be preserved on this medium. On the other hand, a concentrated synthetic nutrient (Richards's solution) was found to predispose strongly to saltation, so much so that it would be impossible, without extraordinary care, to preserve some strains on this medium for more than one or two generations. The latter medium is thus the one to use for the production of saltants, the former is the one on which to preserve them when they have been produced. The different behaviour of the two media is perhaps not entirely due to different concen- tration. The following is a suggested interpretation. It has been noted above that the proportion of inocula which give rise to saltants increases with the age of the culture and is greater in the central region of the colony than nearer the margin. It is suggested therefore that, whatever be the cause of the initiation of saltation and in whatever part of the culture the saltant primordia are laid down, a further period of growth is required before they develop to such an extent that they are likely to be picked up when reculture of the fungus takes place. The parent form, so to speak, has a start of the saltant. If, therefore, the medium is such that growth within the body of the colony soon stops, any saltant primordia would be less likely to develop and produce a small region of saltated tissue. The behaviour of a medium such as Richards's solution would be the converse to this. Here there is a concentrated medium with the minimal staling</page><page sequence="19">W. Brown. - Studies in the Genus Fusarium. IV. 241 reactions. On this account strong growth continues over a considerable time, and thus the conditions are optimal for the further growth of saltant primordia. It is suggested, therefore, that saltants are most likely to be formed on a medium which combines high concentration with minimal staling capacity, and conversely that saltants will not be formed freely on a medium in which growth is soon stopped, either by exhaustion of the nutrient or by staling factors. For the purpose of preserving labile forms in culture, the writer tentatively puts forward the following suggestions : (1) to use a very dilute medium (plain agar in many cases would probably be found as serviceable as any other) ; and (2) to reculture from young cultures, or, better still, to reinoculate from the growing edge of the parent culture. Provided the region of the parent colony behind the growing edge shows the typical appearances of the parent, an inoculum from the edge of the colony will invariably, in the writer's experience, reproduce the parent form. Even with the Fusarium strain D, which saltates so freely on Richards's solution agar medium, inocula taken from the edge of the colony have always been found to come up true to type. The behaviour of cultures of some of these Fusarium strains on a medium like Richards's solution indicates a new interpretation of the frequently experienced c falling off ' or attenuation of parasitic fungi on rich media. This is often interpreted in a kind of anthropomorphic way as being a general weakening brought about by over- rich feeding, &amp;c. The results obtained with such a parasitic strain as D throw considerable light on this loss of parasitic power. ' High-feeding ' as represented by Richards's solution does not attenuate this strain. The latter can be recovered unaltered from the greater part of the culture, but at the same time pockets of saltant strains appear over the colony, and these are liable to be trans- ferred. Some of these possess feeble parasitic powers or none at all, and the transference of any one of these of course involves the loss of virulence. It is not therefore a case of the loss of parasitic power by the fungus, but rather the loss of the fungus itself. Summary. 1. There is no evidence of slow cumulative change during the culture of the Fusarium strains dealt with in this work. Growth curves were determined for a number of strains under standard conditions, and when, after an interval of about a year and a half, the curves were prepared for the same strains under the same conditions, identical results in all essential particulars were obtained. 2. Inocula of spores in the case of some strains give rise to colonies identical with those arising from mycelia inocula. In other cases definite differences do arise in this way, but the difference has always been found to R</page><page sequence="20">242 W. Brown . - Studies in the Genus Fusarium. IV. be small. There is in general no essential difference between spore and mycelial inocula from the point of view of the colonies to which they give rise. 3. Saltations have taken place from time to time in the course of culture of these forms. An account is given, together with photographs, of a number of plates illustrating saltation. 4. Saltation occurs more frequently on some media than on others. Thus transfers to Richards's solution agar in many cases lead to abundant saltation. The new strains do not appear as well-defined sectors in the parent colony, but occur in isolated patches over the surface of the latter. 5. The percentage of saltated areas increases with the age of the colony and is greater in the centre than towards the margin of the colony. 6. A discussion is given of the bearing of these results on the problem of preserving the vigour of strains in culture and suggestions are put forward as to the types of medium to be used, on the one hand for keeping strains in their original form, and on the other for the encouragement of saltations.
