<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fiction, History, and Empirical Reality Murray Krieger I begin by asking an engagingly naive question that a layman would have every right to put to us-and often has. Why should we interest ourselves seriously in the once-upon-a-time worlds of fiction-these un- real stories about unreal individuals? It has been a persistent question in the history of criticism-ever since Plato first called the poet a liar-and it is a question at once obvious and embarrassing. It is obvious because, for the apologist for imaginative literature, it becomes a prolegomenon to all further questions; and it is embarrassing because merely to ask it threatens to put literature out of business and, with it, all those who treat it as a serious and world-affecting art. Why, then, should we interest ourselves seriously in fictions? However elementary, it is a question that is more easily asked than answered. Now, one can simply dwell upon the once-upon-a-time element in fiction and justify it as an escape from the world around us. Fiction's made-up, make-believe character is the very feature which the escapist celebrates. Indeed, it can be argued that Freud justified literature pre- cisely on such escapist grounds, as a necessary sublimation for the frus- trated poet who, as daydreamer, provided daydreams for the rest of us. It can be argued similarly that Northrop Frye constructed his ambitious system as a tribute to the grandiosity of human desire: desire arbitrarily creates its imaginative forms as the world in which it chooses to live, A quite different version of this paper was delivered at the Clark Memorial Library Seminar on Literature and History, March 3, 1973, under the title, "Fiction and Historical Reality." That version is to appear in the Library's publication of the two seminar papers, 1974. The paper was written under a research grant provided by The National Endow- ment for the Humanities.

Thus is his- tory exchanged for myth, with the domain of myth limited to that never-never land, not altogether unlike Freud's, in which things happen as we would like them to-that is, in which we control the forces that, in reality, we find uncontrollable. But, despite the intense seriousness of Frye's system, may we not have found its escapist tendencies frivolous after all? May it not, then, have been these tendencies that kept the system from catching on with more of us, and for a longer time, than it did? The critical tradition has always resisted-despite temptations in the other direction-any theory that took the literary work away from "reality" (whatever meaning one at- taches to that term) and kept it away too long. The tradition has sought, in the end, to return fiction to the mundane truths about us. What else can account for the persistence of some notion of "imitation" and the search for "objects of imitation," however sophisticatedly we maintain, at the same time, the man-made, once-upon-a-time arbitrariness of the fictional fiat? The scholar-critic has traditionally justified his interest in literature by returning again and again to his claim that the literary work must affect the world that precedes and follows it; he must always see in that work, the product of human skill and invention, a model of that world, if not a modelfor it. Therefore, to rest in the capacity of fiction to give us a make-believe escape, as a pleasurable alternative to all that really surrounds us, is a temptation that his dedication to the Arnoldian re- quirement of poetry's "high seriousness" compels him to reject. He must also reject the corollary-in Frye's theory at least-that art must imitate art rather than life: that poems must, in the end, conform to earlier fictions, to the dominant imaginative structure that absorbs all fictions to itself, instead of keeping its eye on the object of imitation out there in the world, beyond all poems. We must, then, ask again about our continuing devotion to fiction, once we decide not to use it as an escape from reality even while we attend seriously to it for its own sake. There is, of course, the alternative justification that would have us use the fiction as an exemplum for sorhe moral universal. Since long before the work of conservative sixteenth- century theorists like Julius Caesar Scaliger, we have been called upon to Murray Krieger is the author of The Tragic Vision and The Classic Vision, which have recently been reprinted in the two-volume paperback Visions of Extremity in Modern Literature.

That is, it creates tales that are not accurate chunks of here-and-now reality in order to represent accurately, by allegory, the truths of some transcendent reality. Thus Aristotle's "fable" is changed into Aesop's "fable." But, as centuries of didactic literary theorizing have taught us, this is not to care for fiction as fiction at all, so long as our interest in it is limited to the thinly allegorical. At one point in his Apology, Sir Philip Sidney speaks, more ambiguously, of the poet's giving us either a world arbitrarily different from our own or one morally better than our own. It is hardly necessary to add that Sidney, soon after this passage, retreats to the safe confines of didactic justification that would insist upon ab- sorbing the "different" world into the "better" one. We too must make our choice: we must decide whether we want an authentic fiction, self-justified, or a mock fiction whose tenuous and momentary existence depends on its leading us to a transcendent truth whose existence hardly depends upon it. And these days we are likely to decide against Sidney: our historical need for poetry suggests that our fictional urge may be greater, and more primary, than our philosophical urge. Our moral promptings hardly exhaust our interest in those strange works about strangers we shall never meet. So, now that we have eliminated escapism and didacticism as inade- quate answers, we return to that initial and not-so-trivial question: why should we worry so about fiction, as if it made any difference to us in our reality? That "as if" in this question is precisely the issue: how can fiction's "as if," like the "as if" in the question, break down so that, as fiction, it does make a difference in our reality and the question, sud- denly converted from "as if" to a statement of fact, must be directly confronted? Without using the fiction to flee from the workaday world and without denying the fiction's cogency so that we may pursue an unrelated philosophical proposition, we must accept the fictional world as intrinsi- cally worth our time and our concern: this fiction must be made into our truth for now. All the while, of course, we know better, for we do not delude ourselves: although we willfully sustain the illusion which allows us to take it for truth, we know it is not truth. We do not leap onstage to rescue Desdemona from Othello's murderous intent; but neither do we fail to attend profoundly, and with intense emotional commitment, to what must befall them both. From Aristotle, in his response to Plato that is a justification of fiction, to Sidney to Dr. Johnson to Wallace Stevens, the history of literary criticism is filled with the struggles to make sense of this dual awareness because we have found fictional illusion useful, indeed indispensable, to aesthetic experience and-given the ubiquity of aesthetic experience-to the human economy as it exists in its culture.</page><page sequence="4">338 Murray Krieger Fiction, History, and Reality Dr. Johnson put this issue masterfully, as he put so many others. He pronounces on it in his "Preface to Shakespeare" in the course of his attack upon the unities of time and place: It is false, that any representation is mistaken for reality; that any dramatic fable in its materiality was ever credible, or, for a single moment, was ever credited. .... It is credited with all the credit due to a drama. It is credited, whenever it moves, as a just picture of a real original; as representing to the auditor what he would himself feel, if he were to do or suffer what is there feigned to be suffered or to be done. The reflection that strikes the heart is not, that the evils before us are real evils, but that they are evils to which we ourselves may be exposed. . . . The delight of tragedy proceeds from our consciousness of fiction; if we thought murders and treasons real, they would please no more. So he can conclude, "Imitations produce pain or pleasure, not because they are mistaken for realities, but because they bring realities to mind." For a moment-in this passage and for this crucial argument, not quite consistent with the balance of his essay'-Johnson, with a call for casuist- ry, is being an authentic Aristotelian. It is in this sense that the Aristotle of chapter 9 of the Poetics distinguishes poetry from history as what "may" happen differs from what actually happens. It is also Aristotelian to find the source of the difference between poetry and historical reality in the "materiality" of the fable and in the principles of sequence ap- propriate to that materiality, independent as it is of the materials of historical reality.2 If it is the materiality of historical events, of empirical realities, that presses us to accept their actual consequences for ourselves with delight or dread, what is there about the substance of that surrogate half-reality that compels our response-at once concerned and distanced-to its shadowy consequences for those creatures of another's casuistry? Ever since Aristotle, theorists have been concerned with poetic fictions as imitations of history, though imitations with a difference. In his chap- ter 9, Aristotle struggles, not always conclusively, to establish the extent to which poetry does or does not depend upon historical precedent. Although we are mainly attentive to his brilliant definition of poetry in its distinction from history, we must remember also his wavering be- 1. I treat the several conflicting positions taken by Johnson in this essay in "Fiction, Nature, and Literary Kinds in Johnson's Criticism of Shakespeare," Eighteenth-Century Studies 4 (1970-71): 184-98. 2. The reading of Richard McKeon is helpful here: "For Aristotle, consequently, imita- tion may be said to be, in the fine arts, the presentation of an aspect of things in a matter other than its natural matter, rendered inevitable by reasons other than its natural reasons ..." (see "Literary Criticism and the Concept of Imitation in Antiquity," in Critics and Criticism: Ancient and Modern, ed. R. S. Crane [Chicago, 1952], p. 162).</page><page sequence="5">Critical Inquiry December 1974 339 tween that distinction and his momentary concessions to poetry's more literal dependence upon history and legend, or upon history as legend. Of course, our awareness of the use of legend, or legendary history, as the source of Greek epic and tragic plots helps explain Aristotle's uncer- tainties, uncertainties that persist even while he labors so effectively in the service of poetry's formal independence of the world of actual hap- penings. The role of history as poetry's object of imitation persists in the Aris- totelian tradition, especially in the conservative notions of those who emphasize imitation over invention and thus must exaggerate poetry's historicity. Witness Scaliger, for example: "Then who will deny that all epic poets go to history for their subjects? History, sometimes delineated only in semblance, sometimes idealized, and always with changed aspect, is made the basis of poetry. Is not this the practice of Homer? Do we not do this in the tragedies themselves?" And he goes on to suggest that historians, also imposing some emendations upon actualities, are as much poets as those we normally honor with that name: "For as the tragic poets base their plays upon true events, but adapt the actions and speeches to the characters, so Livy and Thucydides insert orations which were never recognized by those to whom they were attributed." Thus historian and poet become one, and the distinction between fiction mak- ing and chronicling disappears. Scaliger here reminds us how naive our conception of history is if we think of it only as brute facts, the flow of events itself. We may conceive of history as phenomena, but we may also conceive of history as a humane discipline. That is, history may be the unimpeded sequence of raw empirical realities or it may be the intellectual form which provides the tune to which the sequence marches. Both the raw materials, the so-called data, and the formal constructs our minds impose upon them may be thought of as history: both the history men live through and the history of historians. And as we read historical data in accordance with one or another cause-and-effect model furnished by historical discourse, we are moving into the realm of the fictions that Scaliger saw as akin to the forms of the poets. The sophisticated humanist may become unable to constitute his historical reality, unable even to see the welter of history's facts, except by way of the formative categories which history's disci- plines give him as his visionary habit-the discursive habit he resorts to in order to keep from seeing history's facts as brute. The theorist of history can discover classificatory schemes, alternative model histories, much as Northrop Frye did for literature and its critics.3 3. Hayden White has undertaken just such a schematic analysis, in "Interpretation in History," New Literary History 4 (1973): 281-314.</page><page sequence="6">340 Murray Krieger Fiction, History, and Reality Despite the artfulness that Scaliger shrewdly attributed to the his- torians, thereby seeing them as sharing with the poets the need to im- prove upon history as brute fact, we can yet distinguish between the two. For surely we can try, however vainly, to hold the historian responsible to a reality outside his discourse in a way beyond what-from Aristotle's point of view-we can ask of the poet. The historian's discursive model, however elegant, does have an explanatory function, and what it seeks to explain is, at least for the mind not trapped by the framework, outside the system, as positive or negative evidence. Indeed, the very notion of "evidence"-the notion that such a term is relevant even if difficult to agree upon-suggests a criterion, a need for support, for empirical rele- vance, that is foreign to the poet in his freer creativity. History as "the facts" must somehow serve as the source and "verification" of the history of historians. It is this accountability "to the facts" (and my quotation marks indicate my skepticism about such naively realistic terminology) that inhibits the purity of the historian's formal models, imposing as it does a referentiality upon his work that the poet blithely ignores: "Not to know that a hind has no horns is a less serious matter than to paint it inartistically," Aristotle assures the poet, as he could not assure the his- torian. But of the differences between the poet's forms and the historian's, more later. We should better understand Scaliger's persistent attention to raw history as the source for poetry when we consider my own starting point here-the naive question about our interest in make-believe-and what follows, the joint problems of delusion and illusion. For there is an ambiguity in the apparent reality of the stories we read or-even more persuasively-in the plays we witness. When we watch a drama, we see particular individuals in a sequence of incidents that concludes in certain consequences. There seem to be a before and after for these individuals with their individual names and destinies, so that surely this is an imita- tion of history in the very sense that Aristotle meant it: It is an imitation, what Renaissance critics called a "feigning," and what is imitated or feigned is the historical way things happen. (Is it not this sense of drama as feigned or make-believe history that led Italian Renaissance and later French critics toward the literalistic doctrine of verisimilitude-the claim that any leaps of time or place on stage, any gap in continuity, would violate our empirical sense of how events "naturally" proceed?) What appears to be going on before us looks historical and acts historical, although our responses are rather more sophisticated (as Dr. Johnson reminded us) than they would be to a series of actual experiences which we were observing, if rather guiltily, as voyeurs. I have made it clear that I still consider Aristotle's the most useful way of distinguishing poetry from history. But it is significant that he uses</page><page sequence="7">Critical Inquiry December 1974 341 terms we would apply to chronological happenings to characterize the sequence of incidents onstage, although, of course, it is through the transformation of the meanings of these terms that he establishes the special character of poetic form. Thus we find him centrally concerned with the beginning, middle, and end, as well as the significance of the post hoc. In their before-ness and after-ness plays are like our running lives. But how unlike they are to our lives, these terms are made to attest. For Aristotle, the poet must convert a chronological line of development into a logical one: he must, that is, convert every post hoc into apropter hoc. Thus Aristotle's definition of formal wholeness requires him to set up his own definitions of the beginning, the middle, and the end of an action. And it is logic rather than mere sequence that determines the meanings of these terms. "A beginning is that which does not itself follow anything by causal necessity, but after which something naturally is or comes to be." If, then, a beginning has logical consequences but no antecedents, a middle has both antecedents and further consequences, and an end is the result of all antecedents but has itself no further consequences. Clearly these words have little chronological force as they are employed here: the slice-of-life novel, a chunk of history which intersects the nor- mal chronology of experience at a random place and stops at another one like it further on, can hardly have a beginning, middle, or end in Aristotle's way. The abortive developments of normal experience are also to be purged from Aristotelian form. Even the life of a single man, bounded by the chronological beginning and end of birth and death, does not qualify as a single action unless the poet has so selected and ordered and interlocked its incidents that he makes it one. Aristotle says as much himself in a passage that reveals he no longer has any ambiguity about the casual nature of history by the time he reaches chapter 23: here he claims that a narrative poem, like a tragedy, "will differ in structure from historical compositions, which of necessity present not a single action, but a single period, and all that happened within that period to one person or to many, little connected together as the events may be." (Of course, Aristotle's view of "historical compositions" here is more naive than we have seen Scaliger's to be: he is limiting them to the mere recital of facts.) What the Aristotelian poet does is to transform the empirical world's casual into art's causal (and what new worlds are opened up by the simple transposition of the "su" of casual into causal!). He marks off what, from history's viewpoint, may seem like a mere line segment, plucks it out of its empirical sequence, away from what comes before and goes after, and turns it into all the time there is or has been or even can be. In effect, he bends the line segment into a circle, a mutually dependent merger of all beginnings, middles, and ends; and the self-sufficient world of his poem is enclosed by it. We can never be further from the literal imitation of</page><page sequence="8">342 Murray Krieger Fiction, History, and Reality history, from the dependence of internal sequence upon external se- quence, than Aristotle is here. And it is much further from that external sequence than the historian's model of causality can dare be if that historian is to claim any historicity for his model-if, that is, he is, despite Scaliger, to claim to be more than poet himself. But we have noted that the dramatic presentation itself, however tightly bound its Aristotelian unity of form, retains for the viewer the appearance of mere historical sequence. The poet's form has constructed within this sequence the clues of internal relations which the viewer, with his aesthetic habits of apprehension, learns to read, reconstructing the imitated history into the play. The aesthetic work is there, as innocent and as silent about its meaning as are history's random facts about theirs. But these facts have been converted by the poet's form into elements that are anything but random for those who have been taught to disen- tangle and relate them in more ways than their casual before-ness and after-ness would suggest. So the poem functions as the critic's data very differently from the way in which chronological facts function as the historian's data (unless those facts are seen to come trailing clouds of teleological glory). For teleology is precisely what poetic form boasts as its essential characteristic. It is just the poet's freedom to put teleology where his object of imitation had none that distinguishes him from even the most arrogant historian who would fashion the past in the shapes of his private fancy. These formal characteristics help set the stage apart from our world, thereby creating that "consciousness of fiction" which keeps us from being deluded about the historical factuality of what is unfolding before us in the play we are watching. There is something rare and striking and finally unhistorical about that sequence of events, that imitation of his- tory: it must happen in a certain order and lead to a certain conclusion-and conclusiveness. This is so both because it always hap- pens just this way in this play and because-if it is a successful work-it ought to, nay must, happen just this way because of its internal neces- sities. Just as the poet converted the line segment into the circle of a form that feeds on itself, so the sequence of events that apparently have only a before-and-after relation among themselves turns out to be a frozen sequence, with a sometimes maddening identity among its many unfold- ings in performance after performance, production after production. If there is too marked a change in the way the play unfolds, we protest that it is no longer this play. When Dr. Johnson, echoing Aristotle's notion that imitation pleases, reminds us that we enjoy fictitious sufferings which it would pain us to observe in life ("if we thought murders and treasons real, they would</page><page sequence="9">Critical Inquiry December 1974 343 please no more"), he is justifying our preference for the tragedy we watch to arrive at the customary catastrophe we know it requires. We must prefer the last-minute reprieve that rescues hopes and lives in the real world of our newspapers, although we do not want our tragedies to be changed the same way. It would be more pleasing for a real-life Lear (who of course would then not be Lear at all) to have his Cordelia restored to him breathing truly, and we would cheer the miracle that saved her and, consequently, him. But we must feel that the play-and the pleasure we take in it-is better ended as it is and always has been ended, that Lear's fate is invariably fixed in the fixed form of the itali- cized King Lear. Yes, it is better, for it ought to end that way, although Aristotle reminds us that our "ought" is aesthetic and hardly moral. This accounts for his preferring the impossible probability to the improbable possibility, however devoutly we might wish for the latter in a real-life situation. We are now close to the heart of the casuistic, if not the sophis- tic, element in literature's special reality. The "materiality" of the dramatic performance, then, requires that it be a fixed sequence performed by impersonators whom we know to be such. The rules by which the sequiturs proceed determine that invariable fixity, so radically distinguishable from the always contingent befores and afters of life. And the criteria for our deciding upon the better-ness or worse-ness of the consequences are just as different in the two cases. It was out of this sense of the distinctness of art's ways that the pro- scenium arch and curtained stage came to be seen as an appropriate development for the theater, serving as the frame for the picture of moving life, as far from our moving lives as the still life is from the actual bowl of fruit. And, just as appropriately, the thrust stage returns as dramas more and more reduce to "happenings" and the line between art and life, stage and audience, comes close to being erased.4 I have used the drama because, among the literary arts, it seems, in the most graphically immediate sense, to be an imitation of history-of his- tory, that is, as empirical reality. It has a presence that makes it analo- gous to actual happenings which we are permitted to witness: long be- fore the cinema, the play was a "moving picture."5 But, in their own ways, other forms of imaginative literature similarly suggest illusions of factual presentation. That is, they similarly "feign." In each case, simi- larly, the work displays-often as flagrantly as the proscenium does 4. This is not to deny that the properly aesthetic can coexist with the thrust stage and its illusion of increased audience involvement. But other, less superficial elements of artifice are then required. 5. Lessing, for example, suggests that drama, as the moving counterpart to the still pictorial arts, approaches becoming-like painting or sculpture-a "natural sign," despite the fact that, like the other verbal arts, it consists of the "arbitrary signs" of language.</page><page sequence="10">344 Murray Krieger Fiction, History, and Reality -those elements of artifice which cut off the work from life and pro- claim it make-believe, thereby denying the intent to delude. If we see the play as imitating a real happening, history in the making, we can view the epic, and after it the novel, as imitations of history as discourse,6 whether narrative history or narrative biography. The lyric poem or the first-person novel has a greater or lesser presentational resemblance to autobiography or the confession, each of these in its own way a historical mode, however subjective. The difference of "materiality," to which Dr. Johnson could point in distinguishing stage happenings from actual ones, is less apparent when both the imitation and its object are forms of discourse (epic and "histor- ical composition" or lyric and autobiography). But, from the standpoint of aesthetics, the "material" differences are as profound: the possible relation of discourse to its own conventional forms and to the internal manipulations of its own elements creates a different responsibility to- ward those beings and events which it is about, or (in the case of fiction) is presumably about. If we may revert again to that term from Dr. Johnson, this is to say that there is still a difference of materiality in the live or the feigned objects of the discourse. To choose an extreme case, we must feel that Tolstoy's Kutuzov-or, for that matter, Shakespeare's Henry V-has a different "material" status from that of history's Kutuzov (or Henry). And surely the case is stronger as we move to characters who are nominally fictional as well. All that recent criticism has written about the persona argues, similarly, that Hemingway's Jake Barnes, for example, or even the "I" of a sonnet, has a different "material" status from that of an autobiographical subject. Of course, when we think of a Rousseau or a Wordsworth, the question of when autobiography merges with fictional pseudo-autobiography, when persona merges with person, be- comes a delicate one for criticism to settle in each instance, but without threatening the essential usefulness of the Aristotelian (or Johnsonian) categories. Of course, Aristotle himself is not quite constant to his devotion to form as a human invention. After appearing to fight back and forth with himself about the role of factual history in invented plots, Aristotle-in chapter 9 of the Poetics-finally tries appeasing both sides in the struggle by suggesting the possible union of history's happenings and a humanly satisfying form: "And even if he [the writer of tragedy] chances to take an historical subject, he is none the less a poet; for there is no reason why some events that have actually happened should not conform to the law of the probable and possible, and in virtue of that quality in them he is 6. I refer the reader again to the Poetics, chap. 23, where Aristotle explicitly distin- guishes the structure of the epic from "historical compositions," which they so resemble and to which we have seen Scaliger later try to restore a structural similarity.</page><page sequence="11">Critical Inquiry December 1974 345 their poet or maker." This may seem like hedging in a theorist who will put all his money on man's formal commitment to improve upon history's accidents by imposing his causality upon the mere casualties of happenstance. Today, however, we can perhaps feel the cogency of an attempt to merge fact and art-even to surrender art to fact. Recent commentators have noted more than once that the facts which constitute our recent history outdo the tame possibilities of the most outlandish fiction, since there is in our reality a sensationalism which the human imagination would not dare match.7 Indeed, our reality may render all our imaginations-those of creators and readers alike-shockproof. Thus one can see the merger of history and art taking place on history's side as well as on art's side as Aristotle suggested. One thinks of the so-called new documentary, part of the new journalism, as well as some splendid examples of old history and biography. What is at issue is whether the writer is appealing to a form or fleeing from form by appealing to a random welter of casual happenings, the latter being a flight from form. But form, we know ever since Kant at least, is not fled so easily: the very pursuit of the random, as a pursuit, can hardly be a random procedure. The post-Kantian view, if not the Aris- totelian, would then obliterate any choice between the discourse which imposes form upon history and the discourse which supposedly tries to do no more than reproduce history's purely casual flow. After all, it is that imagination-as a form-giving power-which must give even history's raw data their intelligible contours, almost as if in accord with the compromise between history and poetry suggested in the fence- straddling quotation from Aristotle. It goes without saying that, if the form-giving imagination cannot help but see form in history's casual sequence, it is largely because its prior intercourse with fictions has con- ditioned it to perceive such forms. Thus the imagination collapses his- tory into the categories of human form: in effect, it turns history itself into a fiction, much as Scaliger suggested. This was to become the essen- tial claim of Northrop Frye, who, with a Kant-like division between the order of nature and the order of words, saw the latter as the domain of the free imagination, which must cast nature into human form as our myth. (Wallace Stevens follows here as well, except that he more stub- bornly reminds us of the deprivations produced by that factual world that lies outside our necessary fictions.) Beyond these enabling claims for fiction in Aristotle and Kant, how- ever, there is a further theoretical challenge which is not often pursued: 7. William Wasserstrom's "The Strange Case of F. Scott Fitzgerald and A. Hyd(Hid)ell," Columbia University Forum 8 (Fall 1965): 5-11, is a moving example of this claim. In it the author cunningly shows Tender Is the Night to us as but a pallid reflection (and prophecy) of the assassination of President Kennedy.</page><page sequence="12">346 Murray Krieger Fiction, History, and Reality the attempt to distinguish the special freedoms of poetic fiction from those other forms of discourse whose natures, however fictional them- selves, arise out of an original fidelity to "reality," obliging them to try to drag more of the world with them. For, whatever the degree of sem- blance to the "is" by the "as if," there are in poetic fictions the technical devices, the patterned juxtapositions, the moments of self-reference, the conventional reminders, and-most crucially-the elements of a form that is a transformation of what might have had a simple empirical reference; and these join to shout "artifact" as they seduce us toward the willfulness of an indulged illusion. Thanks to that transformational form, the feigned reality, with its own peculiar "materiality," takes on a presence which presses us to accept it as our truth for now, indeed as a prior truth, a truth that may be normative of history's truth for us. This is a theme to which I must return later, although I shall have insufficient time here to press it, as I should, by dealing with the poetic manipulation of words themselves. It is enough for now to say that the work is no lie and that, without claiming to be true, it interests us for itself. This is, in effect, to say with Sidney "that of all writers under the sun, the poet is the least liar... he nothing affirms, and therefore never lieth. For, as I take it, to lie, is to affirm that to be true which is false.... He citeth not authorities of other histories, but even for his entry, calleth the sweet Muses to inspire into him a good invention.. . . And therefore, as in history, looking for truth, they go away full fraught with falsehood: so in poesy, looking for fiction, they shall use the narration, but as an imaginative groundplot of a profitable invention." In using this support from Sidney, I must acknowledge, alas, that for him the "invention" is "profitable" because his fable is more Aesop's than Aristotle's, so that, like Scaliger's, his fiction is the allegorical servant of Platonic truth.8 But his language and the nature of his argument, taken out of their Platonic context, serve such later defenses of fiction as Johnson's.9 8. To our disappointment, Sidney actually uses Aesop here as an example of profitable fiction making: ". . . so think I none so simple would say, that Aesop lied in the tales of his beasts: for who thinks that Aesop writ it for actually true, were well worthy to have his name chronicled among the beasts he writeth of." 9. Indeed, the justly famous reductio which Johnson uses in the "Preface to Shakepeare" against the arguments for the unities of time and place can be traced to this very place in Sidney's Apology. The brilliant passage whose climax is the sentence, "Surely he that imagines this, may imagine more," is answering the need for the spectator to watch the scene shift from a first act at Alexandria to a second act at Rome, though "he knows that place cannot change itself; that what was a house cannot become a plain; that what was Thebes can never be Persepolis." But, for any such shift to raise itself as a problem in credibility, Johnson tells us, the spectator at the start must really imagine "himself at Alexandria ... [believing] that his walk to the theater has been a voyage to Egypt, and that he lives in the days of Antony and Cleopatra." In his defense of the poet's fiction making, Sidney himself used Thebes as his example of the make-believe required by a play. "What child is there, that coming to a play, and seeing Thebes written in great letters upon an old</page><page sequence="13">Critical inquiry December 1974 347 It is necessary, if fiction is to be defended as an alternative reality of its own and not as a controlled disguise for a higher truth, that we focus our attention, as Aristotle did, on the internal purposiveness which justifies the way everything functions within that feigned reality which comes wrapped in its own materiality. And man becomes the form-making animal: his capacity to create forms and to impose them on matter in a way that brings it to organic life can free him from history by allowing him to reshape it as he will. In Aristotle we have found-despite uncertainties that tend in other directions-just such a dedication to form, to the forceful, even austere, imposition of convergent unity upon casually diverse materials, and we have found it as a theoretical first principle. The formalistic tradition which begins with him requires the utter rejection of the random, or rather requires the transformation of the random, the beating of it into causal shape under the supervision of an insistent, if humanly invented, notion of necessity. For Aristotle, the total functionalism among the parts, their mutual contingency that establishes their all-inclusive pur- posiveness, requires that form be seen as the imposition of a human teleology that is a reflection of a teleology latent, but unrealized, in nature. This is why the poet may be said to have made, in his poem, not a collection of imitated objects drawn from experience (as Plato would have it), but an integral object, uniquely his object. As we have seen, the special value of these humanly created forms, these aesthetic objects, lies in the contrast between the total realization of entelechy in them and the aborted realizations of normal experience. These are other words for the contrast between the order of art and the disorder of life. What is required, then, is the assumption of a random- ness in existence to which art provides a corrective. Whatever Aristotle feels about the ultimately telic nature of reality, it is clear that he sees our experience as full of incompleteness: this is the particular and casual character of historical sequence that requires the poet to introduce, by way of his necessity and probability, the telic character of poetic se- quence. What alternative ways are there of relating the poem to reality so as to account for its order? We can either postulate an original orderliness and purposiveness in our external reality, in which case the poem has but to subject itself to that order, so that it achieves its formal nature by door, doth believe that it is Thebes? If then, a man can arrive, at that child's age, to know that the poets' persons and doings are but pictures what should be, and not stories what have been, they will never give the lie to things not affirmatively, but allegorically, and figuratively written." Of course, Sidney was hardly willing to follow the consequences of his argument to an attack upon the unities of time and place, as Johnson was to be.</page><page sequence="14">348 Murray Krieger Fiction, History, and Reality imitating an existential telos that preexists it; or we can postulate an atelic or even chaotic character to external reality, in which case the poem becomes an original source of telic order, one that imposes aesthetic categories to clarify what in pre-aesthetic (or anaesthetic) experience remains inchoate, pointless, confused. In other words, if art has a unified and purposeful structure as its primary attribute, it must attain this structure either by borrowing it from an order that has already existed (as in the first instance) or by inventing it anew since it has had no existence prior to art's coming into existence (as in the second instance). The first of these alternatives is clearly the mimetic, while the second is consistent with the formalist side of Aristotle. (There is, of course, a third alternative, which denies the assumption that art has a unified and purposeful structure: One can claim that there is no order in existence-prior-to-art for art to imitate but that art's obli- gation is still to existence rather than to itself [or to any independent order it might achieve], so that art should nevertheless be imitative and reproduce in itself the random and atelic character of existence. This view, in fostering an anti-formal conception of art, in effect becomes an anti-aesthetic: it sees that art's duty is to destroy itself by merging with what it conceives to be life's murky meaninglessness. It is to give up its created word in exchange for the given world. It is as if art was to do precisely what Plato originally accused it of doing, except that the world of petty appearances in which it was locked was all the world that was. This doctrine of art's randomness [though I have already asked how one can dedicate himself to the random without losing that random quality at once] represents a departure from the Western aesthetic tradition, though it is a departure that has recently gained a considerable following in all the arts and in the anti-theory that supports them.) Centuries after Aristotle, the rigidly neoclassical aesthetic represents the first of these alternatives. Unlike Aristotle's, it provides for a poem that is at once totally formal and totally imitative. The faithfully neoclas- sical poem is surely a model of order, though it is to be an order that is thoroughly reflective of an already existing rational cosmic structure. All parts of the poem, all decisions made by the poet among the possible choices within any part, are subservient to an overriding purpose, though this purpose seems dictated by the rigorous demands of an equally purposeful cosmic reality outside. A theoretical statement like Alexander Pope's is an obvious example of this philosophical assurance concerning both poem and world. If we put together the claims about poetry in An Essay on Criticism and the claims about cosmos in Epistle I of An Essay on Man, we find the thoroughly consistent and comfortable position of the rational poem within the rational universe of life and art that surrounds it. Despite the considerable distance of years between</page><page sequence="15">Critical Inquiry December 1974 349 Pope's two Essays, the sort of poem (and of criticism) that Pope called for in 1711 is just the sort that the universe he envisioned more than two decades later would both require and justify. Indeed, the earlier state- ment of poetics would positively require as its primary assumption a universal construct of the dimensions put forth in the later Essay. Since the universe itself is conceived as an aesthetic construct, its mutuality with the aesthetic realm is to be expected. The description of cosmos in Epistle I of An Essay on Man requires a mutually supporting relationship between part and whole much like what we have seen to be Aristotle's prescription for a properly teleologi- cal aesthetic structure. The claim, in chapter 8 of the Poetics, was that "the structural union of the parts [must be] such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed." But displacing or removing any item in Pope's world similarly disjoints or disturbs the whole. So Pope now is making Aristotle's aesthetic claim, but he is making it not merely about a work of art but about the dependence of the entire cosmic chain of being on the existence and proper place- ment of each link: any change would "leave a void" "in the full creation," "Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroyed." "And," he goes on, "if each system in gradation roll I Alike essential to th'amazing whole, / The least confusion but in one, not all / That system only, but the whole must fall" (I, 247-50). Here are a disjointing and a disturbance indeed! With such analogous and yet dependent relations between microcos- mic and macrocosmic structures, all based on similarly rational princi- ples of necessity and purposiveness, it is clear that the Aristotelian work of art would be seen by Pope as a mini-world properly in imitation of the world around us. The teleology of the one is echo to the teleology of the other. What we have seen Aristotle attribute to the poet's powers of construction-the transformation of the casual into the causal-is at- tributed by Pope to the divinely architected universe itself, there for the rational philosopher to probe and for the neoclassical poet to imitate in works whose order is discovered in the nature of things rather than invented in response to the nature of mind. This cosmos, then, is as stripped of the casual as is a carefully built work of art. It is no step from here at all for Pope to proclaim the universe to be just such a work of art, which our erring perceptions -poor readers of the cosmos, all of us-may fail to comprehend in the way an Aristotelian should comprehend an Aristotelian tragedy. Yet the world is tailor-made just as exclusively for our understandings as the tragedy was for his: indeed, for Pope tailored it that way. Hence his famous concluding lines of Epistle I:</page><page sequence="16">350 Murray Krieger Fiction, History, and Reality All Nature is but Art, unknown to thee; All Chance, Direction, which thou canst not see; All Discord, Harmony not understood; All partial Evil, universal Good: And, spite of Pride, in erring Reason's spite, One truth is clear, Whatever is, is RIGHT. Once nature has become art, every is is a has-to-be, every casual possibil- ity a causal necessity. With this conclusion to Epistle I, Pope has brought us full circle with respect to where An Essay on Criticism began. It began with his justification of art through appealing to the natural order; so he is now enabled to justify this view of nature by appealing to aesthetic principles-in effect, by treating it as a work of art ("All Nature is but Art, unknown to thee .. ."). In short, he limits art by referring it to nature and limits nature by referring it to art; and he can do both because nature is from the start defined in accordance with the aesthetic principle of teleological order. Pope's tightly closed system collapses any distinction between art and nature, but collapses it on art's side, collaps- ing, that is, nature into art. Nature is the work of the Master-Artist, with our mini-works, each of them a microcosmos, responding to the same rules, the same principles of order, of an indwelling and fully realized purposiveness. I have said that Pope would have us read nature's order with the same awareness of immanent principles of order as an Aristotelian would have in reading an Aristotelian tragedy: in both cases the objects of study have been constructed in a way that is exclusively matched to the read- ers' understandings. The principles of order in the external universe projected by eighteenth-century rationalism are-happily for man -precisely those of the human mind. And, I suggested, it ought to be that way since Pope would fashion his cosmos (and it is his) no other way. If we look at this cosmos through the skeptical eyes of what was later called "critical philosophy"-through the eyes of a Hume or (as influenced by Hume) a Kant-we see that the form of Pope's universe is (whatever Pope's claims or his hopes) a humanistic form after all, just as much as was one of the poetic forms of Aristotle which it so resembles. The form's immanent teleology, that creates necessity as the primary criterion for including any entity within it, is "critically" viewed as an indulgence in dogmatic anthropomorphism. Critical philosophy views this as a self-deceptive practice in which we take a form within which the categories of mind find it comfortable to live-a form that is in conformity with our mental habits-and project it outward upon "objec- tive" reality as if it were reality's form and not ours, as if it were a feature</page><page sequence="17">Critical Inquiry December 1974 351 of nature and not of our mind, so that we are to imitate it (as having been there before us) and not to view it as our creation. It is just such anthropomorphism that Northrop Frye celebrates when he sees the world of human imagination as "nature given human form." But Frye, heir of Kant, expressly warns about the self-deceptive dangers of what he terms "existential projection," which occurs when we reify the humanized form that we have imposed on nature, and claim for it the metaphysical sanction of an ontological reality. The myth may answer man's desire-indeed his need-to live in a world cut to the dimensions of his mental and verbal measuring instruments; his drive for sanity may force him not only to see the world as a reflection of himself but also to believe in it, to ask himself to reflect that self-reflection as if it were a moral obligation. In all this he is a form-making artist, even such a one as Aristotle called for, though he is anthropomorphic in measuring the world to himself and dogmatic in insisting, with metaphysical solemnity, upon its independent and indifferently existing structure outside him- self, outside us all. When we view the mighty dogmatic structure of an eighteenth- century rationalism this way, as an "existential projection" of a common human metaphor, we may not find it so profoundly out of accord with Humean and Kantian denials after all. The dogmatic nature of this structure may be shown to be an illusory anthropomorphism by the probings of "critical philosophy," but the formal needs of human reason are only being reaffirmed by them. The critical philsopher may take the structure of our reality (that is, the reality we require in order to operate successfully in the world) away from a world of things-in-themselves and put it into the formative categories of the human mind, as that mind seeks to impose itself on the phenomenal, history-ridden world that surrounds and would confound it; but, ontological questions aside, these constructs appear to dominate our visions, as we relate ourselves to our world, no less pervasively after Hume than before him. The presiding structure by means of which we shape our responses to our experience may be predicated of reality as something existing independently out there and exerting an objective claim upon us, or it may be seen as a projection out of the subject of knowledge: it may be the ground for an ontological concern or the product of a merely epistemological concern. Even after the eighteenth century exchanges ontology for epistemology, however, the formal and formative constructs continue to dominate our sense of the world in which we conduct our business. As a consequence of the bifurcation between subjective and objective realities, for which Descartes is usually given the credit or the blame in the history of Western thought, the Enlightenment world had come to</page><page sequence="18">352 Murray Krieger Fiction, History, and Reality live with its scientific need to work with the assumption of objective and universal truths. And, free (as we had vainly hoped) from subjective intrusions, man was to use his reason to uncover those objective laws that grounded the motley world of our experience. By the later eighteenth century, however, we were forced to confront the possibility that the world of which our reason was to be a mirror was rather the willful creation of our presumptuous (that is, both dogmatic and an- thropomorphic) imagination. The apparent pressure of a structured world upon our mental structures, a pressure from the outside to our inwardness, was now seen rather as a pressure from our mental struc- tures to the unformed world, from our inwardness to what lies outside us. In giving the law to nature, we discovered that the forms within which we found nature to behave were our forms, not nature's. What we had thought of as the structural ground of an out-there reality was now seen as our metaphor, the mere word that we had mistaken for flesh. Our cosmos was demythified. But Hume and, after him, Kant did not deny the eighteenth-century rational construct so much as they denied its objective ground in exter- nal reality. At the phenomenological level we respond to the same forms whether we create them or they exist independently of us. So the critical philosophers can account for and undercut the teleological claims of eighteenth-century dogmatism without undoing its formal character. For, like Aristotle, they put the responsibility for this formal character in the form-making capacity of man. Through them we have come to un- derstand the drive of the eighteenth-century rationalist to match his objective world to his subjective needs, that is, to trim the world to dimensions within which he can live comfortably and securely. It be- comes a world ordered in a way he finds recognizable. A world so like himself cannot be "other," so that he need feel no alienation when con- fronted by it. As that world loses its grounding in his eyes and the noumena (if there still can be such things) become unknowable, the subject of knowledge, now shut off from the underpinnings of the objects about him, must come to feel their mysterious otherness and his alienation from them. This is precisely the desperation that Goethe's Faust feels as he tries in vain to crack nature's secret immanent principles, from which even he has been cut off. As he fails to gain admittance to them, to feel any fellowship with them, he tries to duplicate and exceed nature's powers by cultivating the human resources for subjective assertion, for fashion- ing the world in accordance with his own formative dream. It is the ultimate humanistic dream-made-fact when, at the end of his monumen- tal strivings, Faust founds a nascent utopia by wresting it from nature's hidden purposes and subjecting it to his own creative intentions.</page><page sequence="19">Critical Inquiry December 1974 353 Humanity's moral and social ends have triumphed over a natural order which, in its indifference to man and his purposes, has shut him out: man creates his own future history as one responsive to his ingeniously invented teleology.'0 There is, then, in the shadow of the death of eighteenth-century dogmatism, a radical break between natural and human teleologies. Thanks to the subjective role of human will, in Goethe as in Kant, the line seems absolute that divides nature's as the realm of the determinate from man's as the realm of freedom. Thus man, exploiting his self-conscious freedom, reads his purpo- siveness into nature, but only for art's sake, creating an object which displays-in Kant's terms-a finality within its form. Kant's is an internal purposiveness, reminiscent of the teleology that operates in an Aris- totelian poem, as it occurs in accord with no purpose imposed from outside the work. It is a retreat to the merely aesthetic from the cosmic: no longer able to ascertain a teleology operating within the external world, Kantian man-though as a cognitive creature he must beware of teleology-puts that teleology into his man-made object as a demonstra- tion of his freedom, of his capacity to rise above nature and history in that he can instill a supreme purposiveness within his creations. Still, he will not presume to relate the teleology in the work to any specific or im- mediate purpose outside the work: hence Kant's finality without final purpose, or purposeless purposiveness, a willful suspension of the will. Man's rigorously delimited aesthetic substitute for his cognitive and practical incapacities produces this new justification of Aristotelian for- malism. The facts of man's irrevocable past are there to enslave, but the forms which his creative present gives him to live with liberate existence by humanizing it. Of course, man's shaping habit leads him to impose causal schemata on all that presents itself to him as data: everything his discourse touches it touches with its forms-everything, and not just the special materials of poetry and the arts. Thus, as I have more than once observed, history itself must be seen, not as brute facts, but as subjects to the forms of the 10. This humanistic dream, in which man's creative fiat turns the dream into fact, may be the ultimate projection of the form-conscious tradition in aesthetics (and, by implica- tion, in all philosophic areas from epistemology to ethics). It is, of course, just this dream-with all of its grandly arrogant presumption-which the last century and a half of human history has destroyed, turning it into parody. Thomas Mann's transformation of Goethe's into his own Faustus brilliantly creates the fictional dimensions of the humanistic self-deception that produces the self-destructive parody of modern anti-humanism (see The Tragic Vision [New York, 1960], pp. 86-102). Mann's perhaps is answer enough to those who would turn the post-Kantian aesthetic into a humanistic way of life, and it may mark the obsolescence of such a hope for life. But I still hold onto the formal promise of that aesthetic tradition as the key to our art and literature, whatever the current drives to celebrate an alternative art and literature in the service of an antihumanism.</page><page sequence="20">354 Murray Krieger Fiction, History, and Reality human discourse that creates it as meaningful for the rest of us. All empirical reality, including the raw materials for (and before) our for- mulations of history (which raw materials I have also termed "history"), is seen as oppressively outside us, a formless continuum that threatens our freedom to create the purposive and causal relations which convert these materials into the humanistic disciplines. Is it, then, that Scaliger was right after all and that the historian and the poet join as humanistic fiction makers in common? Are the forms through which we are to perceive a past moment in our culture a model configuration like that through which the poet asks us to perceive his dramatic episode? Is there, then, a continuum among the various humanistic forms to match the continuum in the preformal data of unshaped experience? Clearly I must resist such a notion by once more calling upon Dr. Johnson's claimed difference of materiality between poetry and history. If we think back to my own dramatic simplification, a few moments ago, of the ideological impact of eighteenth-century rationalism, and the special form it assumes when viewed from the standpoint of "critical" philosophy, we find I am imposing a formal model consistent with the needs of my historical discourse and my theoretical position. In short, it was my mythologized version of history, although surely the capacity of its commonplaces to account for the facts (to the extent that we have access to such things independently of competing interpretive dis- courses) is seriously open to challenge. In this it is like all history, though I do not mean to condemn all of history's schematic or dramatic models as simplistic fictions just because mine may have been so. Yet it is true that in its patterned reductions, its interpretive consistency, every histor- ical model has something of self-referentiality about it, however dog- gedly we think we are holding it accountable to the "evidence," its raw data. Each systematic model is constructed out of, and in response to, its own forms, its reductions, its historical commonplaces, though these commonplaces do claim responsibility to the data. And this responsibility marks the point at which the historical structure, however it approaches self-referentiality, differs from the poetic structure as the formal tradi- tion from Aristotle defines it. As this responsibility attests, it is a differ- ence in the two "materialities," the empirical and the illusionary. I must, once again, then, claim the poetic fiction to be discontinuous with our other fictions: for it is the poem's departure from, and trans- formation of, the raw materials of history that have marked its growth into an autonomous structure. These transformations point us toward the work's inner teleology, its aesthetic center. As a poetic fiction, it is responsive only to that teleology whose principle of internal relations is independent of its external sources in historical reality. Every element taken from that reality-an incident, a character, an idea, even words</page><page sequence="21">Critical Inquiry December 1974 355 and their normal meanings-must be newly justified by the role it must play in that closed teleological pattern. As a result, that element must change its meaning, indeed its very nature and ontological status, by virtue of these interlocked functionings. Let us only recall the special sort of personage Lear must become for us if he is to serve his casuistic role in his tragedy, which responds to rules, behavior, and consequences-and arouses effects in us-so at variance with the "real happening" it may appear to "imitate." But I have said that it is not only brute historical reality from which the poem deviates and which it transforms; it deals similarly with the com- monplaces normally supplied by historical discourse for our understand- ing of various moments in our culture. As I have already suggested, the history of ideas (or rather the historian's ideas about the history of ideas) is also treated by the poet as his raw material, ripe to be deviated from and transformed. Like the words he picks up, and his stories and charac- ters and moral attitudes and technical conventions, the mythologized historical notions around the poet-as the freezing of a culture's internal motions-exist as commonplaces for his work to transform, even violat- ing them if necessary. A fuller, keener, and more humanly illuminating historical awareness must modify the generalized, ideology-bound read- ings made by the historians with the transformations made upon them by the poets. My own reductions of eighteenth-century rationalism, which I con- verted into claims of a metaphoric aesthetic, in light of the skeptic's charge of anthropomorphism, could undoubtedly profit from such modification. Pope-the-poet himself gave half-hidden voice to the pri- vate person's doubts about the extent to which Pope-the-philosopher's world of airy abstractions made provision for the aging, dying man of flesh and blood. I have elsewhere treated "The Rape of the Lock" as a masterful expression of this self-dialogue whose intricacies our histories of ideas normally slight.11 The history of criticism provides one example after another of theorists who have tried to account for the power of poetry as fiction to violate what would seem like the norms of other discourse, the power of poetry as fiction to render our usual concepts of consistency-like our usual concepts of reality-inadequate. Aristotle himself insists that the virtue of artistic probability will not ensure a satisfactory plot unless it is accompanied by the less obvious and less predictable virtue of surprise; thus the "complex plot," with discovery or reversal, is preferred to the 11. See "The 'Frail China Jar' and the Rude Hand of Chaos," The Play and Place of Criticism (Baltimore, 1967), pp. 53-68; and "The Cosmetic Cosmos of 'The Rape of the Lock,' " The Classic Vision (Baltimore, 1971), pp. 105-24.</page><page sequence="22">356 Murray Krieger Fiction, History, and Reality "simple plot." Similarly, the virtue of character consistency can sustain itself though it contain his apparent inconsistency, and the virtue of probability in plot can establish itself though it contain empirical impos- sibility. Plato's earlier distinction between "icastic" and "phantastic" art is adapted (and distorted) by Renaissance theorists like Jacopo Mazzoni so that the truthful imitation of existing things gives way before the ca- priciously invented world of the poet (although this world must be a believable illusion: it is verisimilar, like truth, though not true). Yet the poet's artful intrusion of the "marvelous" upon the merely "credible" must itself force belief upon the reader, forcing that reader to "accept what [he] did not believe could happen." In this tradition phantasy (or, later, "fancy") imposes itself upon us as if it were truth itself, as if it were a discovery made within reality rather than an arbitrary invention that is to be an alternative to our normal reality. Hence the fears of the more literal-minded mimetic theorists like Edward Young who, still following the lead of Plato, distrust the "chimeras" of fantasy. By the time of the theory of Coleridge, "fancy" comes to be relegated to the prosaic limitations of empirical reality, so that now it is the organic imagination which represents the poet's alteration of the norms of our experience. In chapter 14 of the Biographia Literaria, Coleridge relates how Wordsworth and he wanted the poet to unite the "faithful adher- ence to the truth of nature" with "the power of giving the interest of novelty by the modifying colors of imagination. The sudden charm, which accidents of light and shade, which moon-light or sun-set diffused over a known and familiar landscape, appeared to represent the prac- ticability of combining both." This notion and even these words are echoed in the definition of prose romance as the moonlight genre when later nineteenth-century writers like Hawthorne and James sought to distinguish it from the (presumably "realistic") novel. For example, in the well-known introductory Custom House section of The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne sees himself as the ar- chetypal romance writer, sitting "in the deserted parlor, lighted only by the glimmering coal-fire and the moon, striving to picture forth imagi- nary scenes, which, the next day, might flow out on the brightening page in many-hued description." Given the mixture of real objects, moon- light, and the fire, "If the imaginative faculty refused to act at such an hour, it might well be deemed a hopeless case. Moonlight, in a familiar room, falling so white upon the carpet, and showing all its figures so distinctly,-making every object so minutely visible, yet so unlike a morning or noontide visibility,-is a medium the most suitable for a romance-writer to get acquainted with his illusive guests." Hawthorne then lists in detail all the routine items of "the little domestic scenery of the well-known apartment": "whatever, in a word, has been used or played with, during the day, is now invested with a quality of strangeness</page><page sequence="23">Critical Inquiry December 1974 357 and remoteness, though still almost as vividly present as by daylight. Thus, therefore, the floor of our familiar room has become a neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and fairy-land, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet, and each imbue itself with the nature of the other." We are told that even ghosts may be welcome here (shades of those "chimeras" distrusted by Young in his eighteenth- century concern about what Addison, after Dryden, called "the fairy way of writing"). Here such imaginative license is granted as the domestic warmth of the coal-fire "mingles itself with the cold spirituality of the moonbeams" and all of these are placed "one remove further from the actual, and nearer to the imaginative" by being seen in the reflection of the looking-glass. "Then, at such an hour, and with this scene before him, if a man, sitting all alone, cannot dream strange things, and make them look like truth, he need never try to write romances." Here is a gloriously climactic passage for my brief history of theories about the imaginative transformation of reality, a transformation which, though not true, is in its mimetic character "like truth." The reader is thus to allow his normal daylight sense of how things go to be imposed upon by what Mazzoni called the "credible-marvelous." Of course, each of these theorists in the tradition I have so briefly traced from Aristotle to Hawthorne wants to have it both ways, maintain- ing both the deviation from normal reality and a new norm constructed around that deviation. Probability in Aristotle may seem to give way before surprise, but what emerges is a far more impressive probability, one that is earned through the mastery of a major challenge. His consis- tent inconsistency similarly surpasses the cheap satisfactions of an easy, unveering consistency, but it retains the consistent pattern. For Mazzoni, the "phantastic," in the illusoriness of its private perspective, outdoes the reality-bound "icastic" in the belief it can inspire (which is why Plato feared it). Again, the elements worked upon by Coleridge's imagination are made to be far more intimately related to one another than those more obviously related elements worked upon by his "fancy"; and the American writers who defended prose romance surely treasured the truths behind their make-believe causal relations more highly than they did the cause-and-effect truth of empirical reality. So in each case what begins as arbitrary ends as inevitable, having first guaranteed-through its inventive power-that our sense of inevitability has been immeasurably broadened. Form, resisting the simplism of common sense, has cultivated its diversionary antagonist-and swal- lowed it. Form thus reasserts itself by reappearing in shapes more bizarre than, from its trim beginnings, we could have expected. It has converted the most resistant elements of anti-formal experience into its teleology. As verisimilar, the poem takes on a reality that surpasses the empirical reality it has transformed. Such a theoretical emphasis culmi-</page><page sequence="24">358 Murray Krieger Fiction, History, and Reality nates in a critique of form that values it in relation to the anti-formal obstacles it has overcome, in relation, that is, to the anaesthetically real and resistant elements it converts into materials for the aesthetic imagi- nation. Such criteria, characterizing as they do a notion of strenuous and difficult beauty, dynamic in its subduing its antagonists by absorption, lead to an aesthetic and formal judgment that is more than restrictively aesthetic and formal, for its hinges upon the human power to reorder our experiential world. This tradition, in our own time, reveals itself in the critic's explicit concern with norms and-more important-deviations from the norm, together with the movement (in Leo Spitzer, for example) toward the new normfor this literary work, constructed precisely upon the deviation. In the same spirit, Sigurd Burckhardt, in his brilliant essay that is a blueprint for interpretation of this sort, acknowledges that the "disturb- ing element" may obtrude and seem to block the easy interpretation we might like to make (though the poem as a whole may resist it); but he insists this very disturbance can become the enabling feature of the more difficult interpretation that satisfies a less reduced version of the poem's total form.'2 With its new norm, that form can become normative for us all. There is, in the end, responsibility to the world's norms and no mere escape from them. But the responsibility to the world is on the poem's own terms. (Although, as I have said, I can hardly hope to demonstrate it here, the straining words themselves can be forced into new, conso- nant interrelationships, the illusion of a unique language system that supersedes our usual and more general language.)13 As this theoretical tradition would have it, then, the artful illusion of a truth-like, as-if world produces in us a credibility that outdoes the world that is. Its superiority proceeds from a wholeness whose capacity is not strained by the incompatibles it must accommodate without disharmony. Experience outside this poem finds them in fact incompatible, but the illusion of harmony is sustained by the form the poem struggles to achieve. Yet we must not succumb altogether to the fictional illusion we have fostered, lest we mythify the poem in the same way that, as critical philosophers, we have found the eighteenth-century rationalist to mythify his cosmos. If, with Kant, we have reduced the domain of teleol- ogy from the cosmic to the modestly aesthetic, we should not re-deceive ourselves by inflating the poem and the extent of its claims upon our 12.

When it serves as part of a longer chapter in what is to be my next book, Theory of Criticism: A Tradition and Its System, I hope this special function of language will appear evident. On this occasion I can only offer this promissory note, while pleading lack of space.</page><page sequence="25">Critical Inquiry December 1974 359 belief: we should not, with renewed naivete, overstate what it is we believe when we believe the poem. For believe it we must. (I should take note of one recent dissonant voice to these claims. Throughout this essay I have been assuming the tradition of humanistic form making. It is a tradition that has treated poetic fiction as a holistic construct, sacred in its integrity-a "totalization" that Jacques Derrida, for example, would treat, somewhat derogatorily, as the mythification [and mystification] of language. An attitude like Derrida's would prefer a literary model that deconstructs the myth with a language that insists upon its own incompleteness, pointing inadequately to the fluid contin- gencies of reality that break through the seal of art, messing up the shapely as-if world with the contourless world that is. Thus come the lapses, the gaps, and the vacancies that undo the myth of an immanent teleology, now lost to the randomness of "free play." But later versions of what began as the Aristotelian doctrine of fiction see fiction as con- scious of its own basis in illusion, as they concentrate on the work's self-referential features. This self-reference suggests, of course, pre- cisely the consciousness of artifice that carries its own demystification, like that for which Derrida calls, though it at the same time maintains the order of the holistic fiction-if always as fiction. So at their most mature, writers in this tradition include Derrida's concern without undoing their own: they retain their own centered sense of the "totalized" poetic struc- ture while they allow us our awareness of the sense in which it is a false shadow of an uncentered reality and an uncentered language. So if, with Derrida, we choose to deconstruct the illusion, then we are in part turn- ing away from the game and its self-imposed magic, risking as we do the sanity that comes from living within the order it provides. Yet if we choose the illusion, we must play in full knowledge of what it is: this is, in effect, a knowledge of the reality that resists being embraced by our play with an ultimate language. The language of the poem, in providing its own limits, provides this knowledge as well. Art does not undo fact, least of all the fact of death, so that the human mastery art embodies is provisional only. But, though externality and determinateness remain, beyond the myth of a total language and unabsorbable by it, the mastery of the word helps man create for himself where he lives, and for his fellows where they live after he dies.) In stressing the illusory nature of art, Plato, in the Sophist, condemned the artist for confining himself to how things appeared to him from where he stood. The artist imitated, not the particular thing, but the appearance of the particular thing from his particular perspective: par- ticularity heaped upon particularity. (The dramatist, splitting himself up into his characters, was even guiltier of multiplying perspectives.) Thus for Plato the "phantastic" was identified with the idiosyncrasy of the singular angle of vision, and condemned for it. That it can captivate</page><page sequence="26">360 Murray Krieger Fiction, History, and Reality others is explained by those who, from Aristotle onward, define the power of aesthetic form, with its omnivorous teleology. Plato's distrust of the poet is part of his distrust of the sophists, since he sees the poet as sharing the sophist's power of weaving illusions. As Aristotle and Dr. Johnson will-in their different ways-agree, the poet's casuistic world that may be threatens to supersede not only the world of fact that is, but even the metaphysically sanctioned moral world that ought to be. The world of artful illusion, however, is fostered by the poet in ways far more formidable as well as more devious than Plato could fashion for the poet's philosophic model, the sophist at large. For the poet, disdain- ing the limits of normal discourse and cultivating his deviations from it, moves-through his patterned juxtapositions and recurrences-from a single dimension of imitation to the manipulated complications of self- reference. From E. H. Gombrich's notion of self-reference to his notion of illusion is an obvious step, one he takes by working out of Plato's Cratylus14 as I have worked out of the Sophist. Though the poem as illusion attempts to replace the world of mere fact, it does not deny it: the poem acknowledges-through self-reference-that it is but illusion itself, thereby acknowledging also the persistent reality of those mere facts. Yet it will also itself persist. Since it does not ask to be taken (mis-taken) for truth, it shows itself to be too self-conscious and self- referential an artifact to be guilty of "mythification." But it is too devoted to its illusionary totality not to insist on our taking it, in its wholeness, as a completed vision. Though it demystifies itself while it sustains itself, if we merely deconstruct it as we do our usual myths, we manhandle it because we remain blind to its formal power. If Plato originally alerts us to the poet's power of illusion, he does so only to condemn it. For Plato has the metaphysical assurance of a uni- versal reality that allows him to reject illusion as an obvious lie, a misrep- resentation of the truth, the substitution of a private perspective for what is substantially out there for us all. Though Plato can thus berate the sophistic character of the poet in his traffic with particularized particu- lars, for the rest of us-lacking Plato's metaphysical assurance and bur- dened only by the oppressive reality of empirical fact-the illusion is all. Constructed out of the human imagination as its formal answer to fact and addressed to the imaginative capacity for freedom in us all, the poet's illusion raises reality to the responsive precincts of our most inti- mate self-consciousness, creating categories for our private vision. So the singular perspective may be rejected by Plato as the ultimate particular, but, as constituted by form, it can be most cherished by us. For, once it comes to be materialized in the fixed work of art, it is hard evidence that the illusion itself-though without delusion-has finally become a lasting fact. 14.
