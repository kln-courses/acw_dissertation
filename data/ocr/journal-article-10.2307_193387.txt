There are good reasons why history should be rewritten each gener- ation and why Martians probably cannot understand it at all. The account above may sound like dualism: on the one hand, there is a physical universe which possesses certain properties; on the other, a social universe with radically different properties. This is not a fair inference. There is only one universe, though human beings within it can be described and explained in two separate discourses. The physical discourse conceives them as brains, responses and patterns of behaviour while the social discourse conceives them as minds, actions and relationships. In the physical discourse they are of the same stuff as the rest of the universe. In the social discourse they are of separate stuff (except, of course, in primitive anthropomorphic cultures which conceive physical objects as essentially spirit-manifestations). Propositions in a social discourse can become so general and 'testable' that they develop formal similarities to scientific discourse, but this should never blind us to the essential differences. It is generally agreed that the study of politics as practised is 'unscientific'. Ake sees this as a consequence of our failures, McLean as a consequence of the uniquely human situation of choice, and Postbrief sees our differences as being the differences between law-like certainty and inductive probability. Each of these accounts is limited and misleading. The real difference is that the study of politics is necessarily part of a discourse which is of a totally different order to 'science' in the strong, theoretical, sense. 'Science' is exactly what political analysis is not. Local Party Organization, Turnout and Marginality BEN PIMLOTT* In a recent Note in this Journal ('Does Local Party Organization Matter?', III (I972), 381-3) I reported evidence which suggested that in local elections party organization could have a major impact.' This conclusion was reached by comparing voting move- ments in a marginal Newcastle ward, Walkergate, where Labour organization was very weak in 1970 but strong in 1971, with changes in Newcastle as a whole. In this Note a similar comparison is made, with evidence drawn from a Conservative ward, Heaton, in 1972, which shows even more striking evidence of organizational impact. Recent discussion in this and other journals about ward marginality and turnout2 is considered in the light of this evidence. THE CAMPAIGN The effect of organization can be seen most clearly because in 1971 Heaton was virtually untouched by Labour Party workers. In 1971 the constituency and ward Labour parties had decided to concentrate all of their attention on marginal Walkergate. The adjacent ward of Heaton was entirely neglected apart from a delivery of the election address. Even the Heaton Labour candidate spent election day ferrying Walkergate voters to the polls. In 1972 constituency strategy changed. The apparent success of organization in * Lecturer in Politics, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. See also J. M. Bochel and D. T.

Hence, in the month before the May 1972 election party workers went out canvassing every night in Heaton, and four differ- ent leaflets were delivered in the ward, each on a separate occasion, to identified Labour supporters. On polling day some forty people helped to knock up and drive Labour voters to the polls, and Labour households received up to five calls. Elsewhere in New- castle, Labour Party electoral activity took place on a comparable scale only in Walker- gate, which had been worked with equal intensity in I97I. THE OUTCOME3 On a register that had only once had fewer voters on it, Labour received more votes than at any other election since 1945. Yet in Newcastle as a whole, there was a slight swing to the Conservatives, a marked decline in turnout, and an even more marked decline in the Labour vote.

In Heaton, all 1969-72 elections have been straight fights. In Newcastle as a whole, the Labour vote fell by 13 4 per cent. Heaton was one of only two out of nineteen wards in which the Labour vote rose. In the other, the Labour votes rose from 865 to 888, an increase of 2-7 per cent, a result which was probably affected by the withdrawal of a Liberal who had gained 280 votes in I97I. In Heaton, the Labour vote rose from 1,402 to 1,837, an increase of 3I 0 per cent. Turnout fell by 5 I per cent in the city as a whole and rose in only two wards. In one of these, a very marginal ward where campaigning was vigorous on both sides, it rose by 3-4 per cent. In the other, Heaton, it rose by 8-5 per cent. Most notable of all, in the three Heaton polling districts most intensively worked by Labour turnout rose by 12.8 per cent, 9-8 per cent and 8-3 per cent respectively - the three greatest increases of all the ninety-one polling districts in the city. There was a swing of 2-9 per cent to Labour in Heaton, against a city figure of -5 per cent to the Conservatives. The deviation was not more dramatic because Heaton was 3 Voting figures were as follows (I971 figures in brackets): Conservative 2,230 (I,9I8); Labour 1,837 (1,402); majority 393 (516); electorate 9,467 (9,630).</page><page sequence="3">254 Notes and Comments one of only three wards in which the Conservative vote was higher than in I97I. This may have been partly a result of a neutralizing side-effect of Labour organization in stimulating Conservative as well as Labour supporters to vote in greater numbers. A more likely explanation is that the local Conservative party also made more strenuous efforts than in 1971, perhaps alarmed by signs of Labour activity.4 Nevertheless, the swing to Labour since 1969 in Heaton was second only to the swing in Walkergate of the ten wards for which comparison is possible. CONCLUSION The evidence of my previous Note that local organization can have a major effect in raising a party's vote in the low-turnout situation of a local election appears amply confirmed. The 1972 evidence is possibly the more telling because the parties' shares of the poll changed little between 1971 and 1972, whereas the 1971 results showed a dramatic movement to Labour from the previous year. Moreover, the Heaton result shows a strong movement since 197I in the opposite direction from the movement in almost every other ward. Organization was thus pushing against the wind instead of riding with it. Turnout and Marginality: a Comment In his recent Note, ('Turnout and Marginality in Local Elections', p. 255), K. Newton argued on the basis of Birmingham local election results that 'there is no evidence to suggest that marginality is related to turnout or to changes in turnout in any strong or significant manner'.5 He made no attempt, however, to reconcile his evidence with the evidence of analysts who have found such a relationship in other cities. Newton is almost certainly right in concluding that what affects ward turnout most is the social character of the ward electorate. Nevertheless, evidence that organization can affect voting levels suggests that the level of local party activity may often be im- portant, and that changes in this level may often affect changes in turnout. In a rational world local parties would concentrate activity in more marginal wards where organiza- tion would have the best chance of affecting the outcome, and they would do relatively less in safer or more hopeless wards. In view of evidence of the potential effectiveness of organization, one would then expect to find some relationship between marginality and turnout. In practice, some local parties are better organized and some more rational than others. It is possible that the conflict of evidence which has shown a relationship between marginality and turnout in some cities over some periods, but a complete lack of such a relationship in others, reflects variations both in the absolute level of party activity and also in the extent to which marginal wards receive more attention than non-marginal wards. On the one hand, in a city where party organization is generally weak, little relation- 4 P. G. J. Pulzer was looking at general election results when he wrote 'it is likely . . that some at least of the extra turnout... was due to efficient dragooning. The fact that the swing in such constituencies did not differ markedly from the rest of the country is no disproof. If Daz and Omo both step up their advertising equally, their shares of the market will not change much. But Daz dare not let up, lest Omo then gain an advantage', Political Representation and Elections in Britain (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1967), p. 88. The effects of organiza- tion in both local and national elections may often be thus obscured in election after election. 5 A similar point has also been made recently by Jeffrey Stanyer ('Why Does Local Turnout Vary', New Society, 13 May 197I), who showed that turnout has tended to be lower in marginal wards in Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester.</page><page sequence="4">Notes and Comments 255 ship between marginality and turnout might be found. The same would be true in a city where party activity, though considerable, was as intense in non-marginal as in marginal wards. On the other hand, in a city where it was the policy in one or both parties to con- centrate attention on marginal wards, such a relationship could be expected. Marginality per se, may not, as Newton says, be responsible for higher turnout; but an incomplete and varying connection between marginality and local party activity may account for the differences in the observed relationship between marginality and turnout in different cities.</page></plain_text>
