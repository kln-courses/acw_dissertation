<plain_text><page sequence="1">2003-01-0160 Comparison of Belted Hybrid III, THOR, and Cadaver Thoracic Responses in Oblique Frontal and Full Frontal Sled Tests Richard Kent, Greg Shaw, David Lessley and Jeff Crandall University of Virginia Center for Applied Biomechanics Dimitrios Kallieris University of Heidelberg Mats Svensson Chalmers University Copyright © 2003 SAE International ABSTRACT This paper compares restrained Hybrid III and THOR thoracic kinematics and cadaver injury outcome in 30° oblique frontal and in full frontal sled tests. Peak shoulder belt tension, the primary source of chest loading, changed by less than four percent and peak chest resultant acceleration changed by less than 10% over the 30° range tested. Thoracic kinematics were likewise insensitive to the direction of the collision vector, though they were markedly different between the two dummies. Mid-sternal Hybrid III chest deflection, measured by the standard sternal potentiometer and by supplemental internal string potentiometers, was slightly lower (~10%) in the oblique tests, but the oblique tests produced a negligible increase in lateral movement of the sternum. In an attempt to understand the biofidelity of these dummy responses, a series of 30-km/h human cadaver tests having several collision vectors (0°, 15°, 30°, 45°) was analyzed. The pattern, severity, and nature of the resulting rib fractures in the 15° and 30° tests was not clearly different than that observed in full frontal tests, supporting the validity of the dummies' lack of sensitivity to collision direction up to 30°. INTRODUCTION A substantial percentage of frontal collisions occurs in conditions other than the pure frontal, complete-overlap (i.e., centered) condition. In an analysis of frontal car-to- car crashes in the Crashworthiness Data System (CDS), Ragland et al. (2001) showed that only approximately 6% were full frontal, centered crashes (Figure 1a). Left offset oblique crashes and front-to-left-corner crashes were the most common, followed by right offset oblique crashes, front-to-right-corner crashes, and left offset crashes. In total, 78% of the vehicles were involved in oblique crashes and 83% of the vehicles were involved in offset crashes. Similar findings were presented by Scheunert et al. (1992), who found that only 28% of real- world frontal crashes occurred in situations similar to a full-frontal crash test. Offset or angled impact tests better characterized the other 72% of frontal crashes. In addition to being numerous, offset and oblique crashes typically generate more intrusion for a given change in velocity (AV) than pure frontal, distributed crashes and result in a greater number of lower extremity injuries and moderate-to-fatal (maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale 2 and greater, MAIS 2+) injuries (Figure 1). In addition to evaluating collision types by frequency, Ragland et al. evaluated the injuries sustained by passenger-car drivers (belted and unbelted) in these collision types. Approximately 24% of the MAIS 2+ injuries occurred in left offset crashes, followed in frequency by front-to-left-comer crashes and left offset oblique crashes. Only 12% of the MAIS 2+ injuries occurred in full frontal, centered crashes. These data can be used to illustrate the relative injury risk as a function of collision type. Figure 2 shows the ratio of the two injury distributions (Figure 1b and 1c) to the vehicle involvement distribution (Figure 1a). A ratio of one indicates that the percentage of injuries for a given crash type is equal to the percentage of vehicles involved in that crash type. A ratio below one can be interpreted as a relatively lower risk of injury for a crash type, while a ratio above one represents a relatively higher risk of injury. When MAIS 1-2 injuries are considered, there is no clear outlier in terms of injury risk; all crash types have a ratio between 0.8 and 1.2. When the more serious MAIS 2+ injuries are considered, however, there are two clear areas for concern. Full frontal, centered crashes have a ratio of 1 .84, indicating a higher risk of injury than many of the other crashes considered. The highest ratio, however, (2.19) is for the left offset configuration, indicating that this crash configuration is the most over-represented in terms of MAIS 2+ injury risk. 71</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1. Vehicle involvement and injury distribution by collision type, (modified from Ragland et al. 2001). Hill et al. (1993) studied a population of belted drivers and found that injuries caused by seatbelt loads occurred most frequently in crashes involving more than 50% overlap and equivalent test speed (ETS) below 60 km/h. At higher collision severities the steering wheel was the predominant injury source. They also found that the fatal injury rate for belted drivers in crashes having ETS from 35 km/h to 52 km/h was greater in oblique collisions (11%) than in their entire population of frontais (3%). Interestingly, when the ETS range was increased (53 km/h to 79 km/h), the oblique crashes had a slightly lower fatality rate (7%) than the entire population of crashes (9%) and a substantially lower rate than full- frontal crashes (18%). In all cases considered by Hill et al., the oblique collision occurred to the driver's side. This difference in trends when the ETS range is changed may reflect a differing injury mechanism, with intrusion becoming a more important factor in the higher severity collisions. Buzeman (1997) evaluated MAIS 2+ and MAIS 3+ injury risk to belted drivers as a function of overlap in frontal collisions with ETS greater than 32 km/h. The crashes were categorized as near-side or far- side offset with the overlap defined as a ratio of the full frontal width of the struck vehicle. This study found the injury risk (both MAIS 2+ and MAIS 3+) to be significantly higher (p&lt;0.01) in near-side crashes with 1/3 overlap than in the near-side 2/3 overlap configuration, the full-frontal configuration, or the far-side configuration. This increased risk was attributed to intrusion rather than a decrease in belt performance. This study also showed, however, that both MAIS 2+ and MAIS 3+ injury risk were higher in the 2/3 overlap, far-side configuration than in the full-frontal configuration. This is logically not an intrusion-related effect and, instead, may indicate reduced belt performance in the offset configuration. The Ragland et al. study evaluates a population of both belted and unbelted occupants, and it does not evaluate injury risk by belt usage. The Hill et al. study, while useful for establishing the importance of non-full-frontal collisions, does not allow for the direct assessment of restraint effectiveness and how it changes for different frontal impact modes. The Buzeman study does not include unbelted occupants for comparison, but it provides perhaps the strongest evidence that belt performance is directionally dependent when full-frontal and near-frontal crashes are considered. Taken as a whole, these studies provide an indication that the potential for an occupant to be injured in a primarily frontal crash varies depending on collision direction for both unbelted and belted occupants. Furthermore, it is well established that the effectiveness of some restraint systems is strongly dependent on collision direction. In their Fourth Report to Congress, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (1999) found that the fatality-reducing effectiveness of driver airbags decreased from 31% in purely frontal crashes to 19% in ail frontal crashes. Seatbelt effectiveness may also vary with frontal collision direction, though much less than airbag effectiveness. Evans (1990) observed a non- significant trend, with seatbelt fatality effectiveness of 43% in purely frontal collisions, decreasing to 41% for right-frontal collisions and 38% for left-frontal crashes. This trend may be explained by differences in the interaction of the belt with the thorax and shoulder and by differences in injury mechanisms. Hontschik and Ruter (1980) found that oblique collisions that result in the occupant translating laterally away from the center- line of the vehicle can result in the occupant being "dragged along the door" and the head hitting the front part of the window frame (this head contact was also observed by Faerber 1982). This type of oblique collision can also cause neck loading from the shoulder belt. When the collision vector is rotated to the other side of the vehicle (i.e., the occupant moves inboard, 72</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Relative importance of various crash configurations expressed as a ratio of injury distribution to involved vehicle distribution. This shows that left offset and full frontal centered collisions generate a disproportionately higher number of MAIS 2+ injuries than other frontal collision modes. *1. Right offset, 2.

Right full oblique (see Ragland et al. 2001 ) away from the door and the shoulder belt anchor), restraint performance can be compromised when the thorax/shoulder escapes the shoulder belt (Hontschik and Ruter 1980, Horsch 1980). Frontal collisions in which the occupant has some lateral component of motion are therefore an important area of attention for vehicle and restraint designers. Design efforts require a laboratory tool that can be used to assess performance in staged tests. The Hybrid III 50th percentile male anthropomorphic test dummy (ATD) is the standard tool for this research, but its utility for restraint design is uncertain, particularly in an oblique test configuration. The primary source of kinetic data used to develop the Hybrid III is the test series presented by Kroell et al. (1971, 1974), supplemented by tests and analyses presented by Neathery (1974), Patrick (1981), and others (see Melvin and Weber 1988 and Schneider et al. 1989). The Kroell tests involved a circular, 15.3-cm diameter rigid impactor, which struck cadavers at the level of the fourth interstitial space. These tests were intended to represent an unrestrained occupant loading a steering wheel hub, which is not representative of restraint system loading. Furthermore, the shoulder of the Hybrid III is en essentially rigid structure with no consideration of the clavicle or of the complex linkage that forms the human shoulder. The Test Device for Human Occupant Restraint (THOR) dummy is the latest in a line of advanced frontal impact dummies developed by the NHTSA with the intention of improving restraint interaction and biofidelity over the Hybrid III (Schneider et al. 1992, Rangarajan et al. 1998, Xu et al. 2000, Shaw et al. 2000). Using biomechanical data that were unavailable to the Hybrid III designers, THOR's face, neck, shoulder, thorax, spine, abdomen, pelvis, and femurs have been redesigned to be more humanlike. To improve restraint interaction, THOR's thoracic spine includes a flexible rubber link whereas the Hybrid Ill's spine is rigid from the lumbar to the neck. THOR's rib cage has been designed to approximate human rib geometry and structure better than that of the Hybrid III (Figure 3). THOR includes a clavicle structure and a linkage intended to simulate the shoulder structure of a human. THOR is also equipped with enhanced instrumentation, including a three-dimensional thoracic deflection measurement system, which is intended to improve restraint assessment. The purpose of the current study is to compare the thoracic responses of the Hybrid III and the THOR and to evaluate how these responses change when the direction of the collision vector changes. These dummies' sensitivity to impact direction is assessed relative to a series of human cadaver tests performed over a range of frontal impact angles. Previous studies have documented the dummy kinematics and restraint interaction that occur in oblique collisions over a range of angles, both when the collision is away from the belted shoulder and when it is toward the belted shoulder (e.g., Horsch 1980, Hontschik 1980, Faerber 1982). The current study is intended to augment and expand upon these studies 1. by reporting the detailed thoracic deflections that occur in one oblique scenario, including lateral motions, as measured by advanced instrumentation on two different dummies, and 2. by comparing those deflections with the deflections that occur in a purely frontal crash and with the patterns of injury sustained by cadavers in oblique and frontal impacts. 73</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3.

The dots indicate the anterior chest wall attachment Doints of the internal chest deflection measurements. METHODS This study is not intended to evaluate all oblique modes that can occur (see Figure 2). Instead, it evaluates a belted occupant's thoracic loading and how this loading changes when the collision vector changes. As a result, a restraint condition was chosen to maximize the belt/thorax interaction and, presumably, to maximize this angle dependence. The front passenger environment was chosen so the confounding effect of steering wheel loading would not be present and to facilitate comparison with existing cadaver tests, which were performed on a sled without a steering wheel. The principle direction of force (PDOF) was chosen so the belt would be the primary restraint (rather than "dragging along the door" as observed by Hontschik and Ruter 1980) and so the belt interaction would be primarily with the thorax and shoulder rather than the neck. Eight tests (two frontal and two oblique with each dummy) were performed at the University of Virginia (UVA) using a Hybrid III and a research version of THOR. Tests were performed using a contemporary mid-size U.S. sedan buck mounted on a deceleration sled (Table 1). The dummy was in the front passenger position for all tests and restrained by a standard (not force-limiting) three-point unibelt system, a model-year 1998 (i.e., "depowered") airbag, and a ruggedized production seat. The buck was mounted in two configurations: pure frontal (12:00) and 30° oblique. The oblique configuration involved a +30° rotation about the vehicle's Z axis (SAE J21 1), which can be expressed as an 11:00 PDOF. In this configuration, the passenger- side occupant moves forward and inboard during the collision, away from the shoulder belt anchor. Since the purpose of this study was to isolate the effect of collision angle, similar 20-g trapezoidal sled pulses were used for both the frontal and the oblique test conditions (Figure 4). This does not represent a vehicle's crush response, which will typically result in a longer crash pulse of lower magnitude in an offset collision (e.g., Berg et al. 1996). The airbag was deployed via a capacitive discharge squib ignitor 13 ms after initiation of the sled pulse. The sled tests did not attempt to simulate vehicle yaw. All dummy tests were performed with a nominal 48-km/hr sled velocity change (AV).

Sled deceleration pulses used in the full-frontal and oblique dummy tests. A supplemental string-potentiometer array was installed in the Hybrid III dummy to track the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral motions of the four corners of the sternal plate (see Figure 3). This system, which was developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (Hagedorn and Pritz 1993), consists of four potentiometer pairs secured bilaterally to the spine. The strings attach to the ends of the first and sixth dummy ribs. One string in each pair connects the spine to the ipsilateral rib (straight string), while the other string connects the spine to the contralateral rib (crossover string). The measurements from both strings are processed to generate anterior-posterior and lateral motion at each attachment site (Butcher et al. 2001). Data from the standard Hybrid III chest potentiometer ("slider") and a triaxial accelerometer at the nominal chest center of gravity (eg) were also collected. THOR instrumentation included four displacement measurement units (CRUX) located bilaterally on the upper and lower thorax. The CRUX units are two-bar linkages with rotary potentiometers that track the three- dimensional motion of the anterior chest wall at four locations (see Figure 3). The THOR spine was adjusted to the erect configuration in all tests. Belt forces were measured using force gauges (Lebow Products, Inc., Troy, Michigan) on the shoulder belt below the d-ring (shoulder belt, upper), on the shoulder belt above the buckle (shoulder belt, lower), and on the lap belt between the dummy's pelvis and the belt attachment site on the vehicle (lap belt, outer). The dummy results were evaluated relative to a series of 20 (15 male, 5 female) full frontal and oblique cadaver sled tests performed at the University of Heidelberg in the late 1970s and early 1980s. These tests involved belted subjects without an airbag in 30 km/hr collisions. Mean sled deceleration was 9g to 12g in the oblique tests and 14g to 15g for the frontal tests. The oblique tests involved three different collision vector angles: 15°, 30°, 45°. These tests involved occupants with both the "driver" and "passenger" configuration. In the oblique cases, the "passenger" configuration refers to the case where the occupant moves away from the shoulder belt anchor (thus, these cases are analogous to the oblique impact scenario simulated in the dummy tests). In the "driver" configuration, the occupant moves toward the shoulder belt anchor (thus, these cases are not analogous to the dummy tests). These tests were performed on an isolated seat (not in a vehicle), so there was not door interaction for either configuration. Subjects ranged in age from 21 years to 75 years at death and ranged in size from 57 kg to 89 kg. The results from these tests have been published previously (e.g., Kallieris et al. 1982), but never compiled in the manner presented here. RESULTS Both the frontal and the oblique configurations were found to generate reasonable and repeatable dummy results, though the frontal condition was in general more repeatable than the oblique. As expected, both dummies exhibited greater z-axis thoracic rotation in the oblique collisions than in the frontais (Figure 5), with the THOR rotating more than the Hybrid III. Belt loads and thoracic kinematics were found to be insensitive to the 30° change in collision angle. For example, the Hybrid III peak chest resultant acceleration (Table 2) was only 10% greater in the frontal tests (44 g mean) than in the oblique tests (40 g mean) and the time histories were similar (Figure 6). The THOR's resultant chest acceleration exhibited even less sensitivity to collision angle than the Hybrid Ill's (approximately 5% greater in the oblique tests, see Table 3). For both dummies, the peak lap belt tension varied less between collision angles than it did from test to test (Table 2 and Table 3). Similarly, the lower shoulder belt tension range from test to test overlapped the range from 0° to 30° collision angle. The upper shoulder belt was the only location where the belt tension showed a clear, albeit small, difference when the collision vector changed. In the THOR tests, the mean upper shoulder belt tension in the oblique tests was approximately 3% greater than the mean in the frontal configuration. Hybrid III exhibited the opposite trend, with the frontal configuration resulting in approximately 4% greater mean shoulder belt tension. When both collision directions are considered, the outer lap belt tension was significantly (p&lt;0.01) greater for the Hybrid III (mean = 8,521 N) than for the THOR (mean = 5,128 N), but the shoulder belt loads were similar for the two dummies. The chest deflection was insensitive to collision angle for both dummies. While the magnitude of the Hybrid III internal chest deflection, as measured by the standard sternal slider, was approximately 10% greater in the frontal tests (40 mm mean) than in the oblique tests (36 mm mean), the time histories were similar in shape (Figure 6). Furthermore, the two-dimensional motion of the anterior chest wall was remarkably insensitive to collision angle for both dummies (Figure 7). As shown in 75</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5. Comparison of dummy kinematics in full frontal and oblique collision configurations. Figure 7a, the Hybrid III sternum displaced posteriorly and slightly to the left in both the frontal and the oblique tests. The magnitude of the posterior motion was slightly greater in the frontal tests, but the lateral motion was not much greater in the oblique tests than in the frontais. In particular, the upper sternum lateral displacement was essentially identical in the frontal and oblique tests. Figure 7b shows that the THOR chest deflection was also insensitive to collision angle. In fact, the THOR's posterior deflection was less sensitive than the Hybrid Ill's. There is, however, a pronounced difference between the two dummies. The Hybrid III deflected more on the left side in both crash configurations, but the THOR's upper chest deflected posteriorly and to the right. In addition, the THOR's upper chest deflection was greater on the right side than on the left (Figure 7b, upper plot). This trend was reversed for the THOR lower chest, which deflected more on the left side. In addition, the lower right portion of the THOR's chest actually deflected anteriorly early in the collision (Figure 7b, lower 76</page><page sequence="7">Table 2 - Hybrid III Maxima and Minima Test Number Measurand Max. or Min.

This lower right deflection of the THOR chest is the only measurement where there is a clear difference in the frontal and oblique collisions. In the frontal tests, the lower right portion of the THOR chest moves slightly anteriorly. In contrast, in the oblique collisions the lower right portion of the chest moves antero-medially approximately one centimeter before moving postero-laterally. Finally, unlike the Hybrid III, the THOR chest deflected primarily to the right. Cadaver thoracic hard tissue trauma in the oblique and full-frontal sled tests was limited to rib and sternal fractures, with AIS values ranging from 0 to 4 (Table 4). Cadaver rib fracture patterns were found to be similar for all collision angles up to 30°, regardless of collision angle or configuration ("driver" vs. "passenger"), with fractures concentrated along the path of belt loading (Figure 8). Comparison of the 0° and the 15° collisions shows essentially identical rib fracture patterns (Figure 8a, 8b, 8c). In the 30° tests, one subject sustained fractures on the left rib 4 and rib 5. Fractures at these locations were not observed in the frontal tests. Other than this difference, the overall fracture pattern in the 30° tests was similar to the pattern in the full frontal tests (Figure 8c, 8d). When the oblique angle increased to 45°, however, the fractures became more concentrated on the superior ribs and were frequently more displaced than in the other collision angles (Figure 8e). DISCUSSION This study is not intended to address injury risk or restraint effectiveness as a function of collision direction. Rather, its purpose is to show the need for a dummy capable of addressing these issues and then to evaluate the thoracic response of two dummies. To that end, this study quantified how two different dummy designs 77</page><page sequence="8">Figure 6. Resultant chest acceleration and sternum slider deflection measured in the Hybrid III full-frontal and oblique tests. and how cadavers react in a limited number of oblique scenarios compared to a full-frontal scenario. The primary findings of this study are, first, that the dummies exhibit markedly different thoracic deformations and, second, that neither dummy exhibited a strong sensitivity to collision angle for the scenarios tested here. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DUMMIES The Hybrid III and THOR dummies, while both insensitive to the change in collision angle, exhibited dramatically different responses in these tests. The THOR chest actually displaced anteriorly at the lower right CRUX location in both the frontal and the oblique tests. In contrast, the Hybrid III chest displaced posteriorly at all times and at all locations. This response difference appears to be characteristic of these dummies and has been observed in previous tests. Shaw et al. (2000) compared the responses of Hybrid III, THOR, and human cadavers in full frontal tests. They found that this anterior motion on the lower portion of the chest on the side away from the shoulder belt anchor, which they termed "bulge out", occurred in both the THOR and the human cadavers, but not in the Hybrid III, and concluded that this response was biofidelic. Based on this conclusion, and the fact that the Heidelberg cadaver tests suggest similar thoracic response in frontal and oblique collisions up to 30°, one can infer that the THOR's "bulge out" observed in our oblique tests is also biofidelic. Unfortunately, the Heidelberg oblique cadaver tests were performed prior to the advent of chestbands (Eppinger 1989) so this inference cannot be verified by direct comparison. In addition to differences in "bulge out", the dummies exhibited a second substantial difference in response. The Hybrid III chest displaced to the left in both test configurations and the maximum deflection was on the left side of the chest. The THOR, on the other hand, exhibited motion to the right on the upper chest with the maximum deflection occurring on the right side of the upper chest. The THOR lower chest exhibited maximum deflection on the left side of the chest. These observations can be explained by consideration of the thoracic structure of the two dummies. The Hybrid III sternal plate is a relatively small, stiff, plastic unit that moves as a single, essentially rigid, structure (Figure 9). The plate is attached to the ribs via a hinge configuration that allows sternal rotation relative to the ribs about the local z axis (i.e., the axis at the intersection of the sagittal and coronal planes, see Figure 3), but there is no mechanism to allow the sternum to rotate about the local y axis (i.e., the axis at the intersection of the coronal and transverse planes, see Figure 3). In contrast, THOR's sternal plate is much larger in area and fabricated entirely from flexible plastic. As a result, the THOR's chest is much less coupled while the Hybrid III sternum must move essentially as a unit. It is to be expected, therefore, that these dummies would exhibit substantially different responses to seatbelt loading. Shaw et al. (2000) hypothesized that THOR's out-of-plane sternal movement patterns were present in their cadaver tests, but noted that the chestbands did not provide enough information regarding the position of points on the anterior chest wall to conduct the necessary analysis. Unlike the dummies' internal instruments that record the position of points on the upper and lower anterior chest wall relative to a common rigid spine segment, the upper and lower chestband installed on the cadavers record anterior chest wall position relative to separate spine segments. These spine segments are free to move relative to one another and do not provide the common reference necessary to relate the position of points on the upper chest to those on the lower chest. From the available cadaver data, therefore, it is not possible to state definitively which of these dummies, if either, is exhibiting human-like behavior though, again, the inference would be that the flexible and geometrically more human-like THOR chest is more biofidelic. This inference is supported by the location of fractures sustained by the cadavers. Rib fractures were located 78</page><page sequence="9">Figure 7.

If these results are transposed to the passenger side configuration for comparison with the dummy thoracic deflections, the THOR deflection, which was greater at the right superior and left inferior locations, would predict the cadaver injury pattern while the Hybrid III deflection, which was greater on the left both superiorly and inferiorly, would not. Shear motion from 3-pt belt restraints has been observed in frontal sled tests (Viano and Culver 1981). Our findings confirm the presence of lateral shear motion of the anterior chest relative to the posterior, even in purely frontal tests (Figure 7). Our findings do not agree with the findings of Viano and Culver in the direction of this shear motion, at least for the Hybrid III dummy (see their Figure 6). Their tests, which were performed with a driver-side seatbelt configuration (belt over the left shoulder), resulted in shearing motion of the Hybrid III chest to the left. The tests presented here, which were performed with a passenger-side belt configuration (belt over the right shoulder), also resulted in shearing motion of the Hybrid III chest to the left. The reason for this discrepancy is not known, but may be related to differences in belt geometry, seat characteristics, and other testing details. Shearing motion was also observed for the THOR dummy in these tests, in agreement with previous researchers (Shaw et al. 2000). The direction of the shear motion was more complex with the THOR than with the Hybrid III. In the upper left portion of the sternum, the shearing motion was pronounced and to the right (toward the shoulder belt anchor - contradictory to the Hybrid III motion). The upper right and lower left portions of the sternum also moved to the right, but less than the upper left. In contrast, the lower right portion of THOR's sternum moved left. The observed differences in thoracic deformation between the two dummies are due to a combination of parameters that include differences in chest construction and in the pattern of belt loading. Thoracic loading from a shoulder belt is affected by factors such as sitting posture and shoulder and spinal compliance (e.g., Adomeit and Heger 1975, Adomeit 1977, Horsch et al. 79</page><page sequence="10">Table 4 - Cadaver Description and Test Results Age/ Collision Peak Shoulder Number of Avg Rib Fx Thoracic Test Gender Mass Angle Position* Belt Force Rib Fx (Std Dev) MAIS Notes 79/01 26/m 63 kg 0o D 4.2 kN 0 2 Sternal fx. 79/02 43/f 58 kg 0o D 3.8 kN 3 3 Sternal fx. 78/54 21/m 71kg 0o D 4.5 kN 0 2 Sternal fx. 78/53 43/m 68 kg 0o D 2.4 kN 2 2.4(2.9) 2 Sternal fx. 78/51 51/m 80 kg 0o D NA 4 3 Sternal fx. 78/50 28/f 65 kg 0o D 4.2 kN 0 2 Sternal fx. 78/48 55/m 72 kg 0° D 5.0 kN 8 3 Sternal fx. 79/14 56/f 64 kg 15° D 3.9 kN 4 3 Sternal fx. 79/20 59/m 57 kg 15° D 3.6 kN 11 6.3(4.0) 4 79/21 52/m 89 kg 15° P 5.4 kN 4 3 Sternal fx. 79/22 23/m 75 kg 30° D 3.7 kN 4 3 79/23 39/m 81 kg 30° D 3.8 kN 1 1 79/24 75/f 64 kg 30° D 2.0 kN 9 2.7(3.4) 3 Sternal fx. 79/25 69/m 64 kg 30° D 2.8 kN 2 2 Sternal fx. 79/26 24/m 72 kg 30° D 3.5 kN 0 0 79/29 35/f 70 kg 30° P 3.6 kN 0 0 80/07 69/m 69 kg 45° D 3.8 kN 7 3 Sternal fx. 80/09 45/m 73 kg 45° D 4.5 kN 3 2.8(3.1) 2 Sternal fx. 80/16 56/m 88 kg 45° D 5.0 kN 1 1 81/01 38/m 73 kg 45° P 4.7 kN 0 2 Sternal fx. *ln oblique tests, D refers to "driver" configuration, in which subject moves toward shoulder belt anchor.

Comparison of Hybrid III, THOR, and human anterior thoracic structures. Figure 10. Comparison of Hybrid III and THOR pre-test configurations showing seatbelt position (note: photographs taken from slightly different angles). 1991, Mertz et al. 1991). Furthermore, differences in rib cage construction result in thoracic measurement points that are not coincident on the two dummies, as shown in Figure 3, and in differences in thoracic depth (Figure 10). One effect of this difference in chest depth is that the belt geometry, both initially and throughout the test, is different between the two dummies. Furthermore, the lap belts forces exerted on the two dummies are significantly different. This phenomenon has been observed in previous studies of purely frontal impacts (Shaw et al. 2000). This difference is not reflected in the resultant pelvic acceleration or in the femur loads (Table 2 and Table 3), however, so it is difficult to identify precisely the cause of this dramatic difference. Potential explanations for this difference, as previously discussed by Shaw et al. (2000), include differences in pelvic tilt, pelvic compliance, and the differences in the design of the ischial portion of the pelvis, which may result in a different interaction with the seat pan. The lap belt loads are also transmitted to the thorax differently for the two dummies, with the THOR's lumbar spine being less stiff. Differences between the dummies in other body regions, which result in a different input to the thorax, therefore contribute to the observed differences in thoracic response. In other words, the differences in the thoracic deformations of the dummies are only partially explained by differences in thoracic compliance. The influence of all the design differences between the two dummies, and how they influence thoracic response, cannot be fully explained in the relatively complex environment of a sled test. The dummies used for this study should be tested further to explore the effects of sitting posture and shoulder, pelvic, and spinal compliance variation on belt loading and thoracic deformation. INSENSITIVITY TO COLLISION ANGLE Neither dummy exhibited dramatic changes in thoracic deformation response when the collision direction was changed. It might be expected that the resultant chest acceleration would not change substantially with collision angle. The kinetic energy imparted to each dummy during sled run-up is constant regardless of the collision angle. Furthermore, the deceleration pulse imparted to the sled was programmed to be essentially identical regardless of the collision angle. In a simplified sense, the shoulder belt is pinned at either end and, as such, it cannot sustain a moment at the attachment sites. As long as the collision angle is not so large that the shoulder belt slides relative to the thorax, the belt will orient itself to apply load on the thorax. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that the magnitude of the shoulder belt forces and of the resultant thoracic acceleration that results from this belt loading will be relatively insensitive to a 30° change in collision angle (though the body-coordinate components of thoracic acceleration obviously change). Similarly, the small change in posterior chest deflection is to be expected 81</page><page sequence="12">since most of the belt loading goes through the shoulder rather than through the sternum. The shoulder and upper thoracic structures are better able to tolerate force than the structures in the lower thorax. As a result, proper seatbelt performance induces thoracic pitch, which results in a large proportion of the occupant's kinetic energy being dissipated via loading through the shoulder rather than through the chest (Adomeit and Heger 1975, Adomeit 1977). Horsch et al. (1991) imposed belt loading on the Hybrid III dummy with and without the shoulder structure. Based on these tests, it is not unreasonable to conclude that well over half of the measured belt force is directed through the shoulder rather than through the sternum. In both the frontal tests and the oblique tests considered here, substantial torso pitch occurs with the resulting pronounced shoulder loading. Collision-angle-related changes in posterior chest deflection are therefore minimized by the fact that the shoulder sustains most of the loading in both impact configurations. The insensitivity of both dummies' lateral thoracic deformation patterns to a substantial change in collision angle was, however, an unexpected result of this study. Despite the dominating effect of shoulder loading, we expected that a 30° change in the collision vector would manifest itself as an increase in the shear load on the chest and an increase in the resulting lateral deflection of the sternum relative to the spine. This was not observed, however. The shear motions of both dummies were not sensitive to collision angle (Figure 7). Increased z-axis rotation of both dummies could be observed, however, in the oblique test condition. It is possible that this difference in torso rotation minimized the difference in shear loading, though a satisfactory understanding of this behavior and of the insensitivity in shear loading has not yet been attained. The compelling question that arises from these findings is whether this lack of sensitivity to collision angle is biofidelic. The cadaver tests, while having some important differences relative to the dummy tests, are the best available data for addressing this question. These tests indicate very similar rib fracture patterns up to a 30° collision angle, which supports the assertion that the thoracic loading environment does not change substantially up to 30° for belted occupants subjected to oblique impacts. The significance of the different collision speed for the cadaver tests is likely limited to the fact that additional rib fractures would have occurred if the cadaver tests had been performed at the higher speed used in the dummy tests. It is unlikely, however, that the rib fracture pattern would have changed significantly at this higher speed (Kent et al. 2002). It is not known whether the dummies would indicate a substantial change in thoracic loading if the sled angle was increased to 45°, but the cadaver rib fracture patterns suggest that there is indeed a substantial change in the belt loading experienced by the subject as the collision vector increases from 30° to 45°. The primary conclusion to draw from this study is that the thoracic loading environment for a "normally seated", belted human is not substantially different in a purely frontal collision than in a 30° oblique collision (where the motion is away from the shoulder belt anchor) and that both the Hybrid III and the THOR capture this lack of sensitivity. Superficially, this finding appears to contradict the sensitivity to impact direction of both belt (slight sensitivity) and airbag (strong sensitivity) effectiveness in frontal and near-frontal crashes as observed in the field. This finding should therefore be interpreted carefully. First, the tests presented here involved a "normally seated" occupant. In the field, occupant positioning plays a large role in restraint effectiveness and it is possible that systematic differences in occupant positioning may exist between full frontal and oblique crashes. For example, the same vehicle motions that result in an oblique collision may result in the occupant being displaced in the vehicle prior to impact. Second, only thoracic deformations were considered in this study. Field data-based studies of restraint system effectiveness usually consider all body regions. Third, the sled tests presented here did not include any vehicle yaw, which plays an important role in occupant kinematics in the field. Fourth, there was very little interaction between the occupant and the airbag in our tests. The interaction was so slight that it is reasonable to consider the thoracic loading to be all belt loading. As a result, a comparison of airbag efficacy in frontal and oblique conditions cannot be done using these tests. Finally, in an oblique collision where the occupant moves toward the side of the vehicle (rather than toward the center of the vehicle, as in this study), there is an increased risk of head or thoracic loading from the door or other vehicle interior components. This loading was not present in these tests. Neither was interaction with another occupant considered. CONCLUSION In the well-controlled environment of a sled test, thoracic loading from a seatbelt is not strongly sensitive to a +30° change in the direction of the collision vector. Rib fracture patterns of belted human cadavers exposed to purely frontal impacts are virtually indistinguishable from the patterns of cadavers exposed to oblique impacts up to 30°. Both the Hybrid III dummy and the THOR dummy exhibit a lack of sensitivity, though the Hybrid III is slightly more sensitive than the THOR. Hybrid III chest deflection was on the order of 10% lower in these oblique tests than in these frontais, while THOR chest deflection was essentially unchanged at all locations except the lower right. Though the two dummies were consistent in their lack of sensitivity to collision direction, they exhibited markedly different responses as described above. Differences in thoracic "coupling" and geometry between the dummies are identified as primary mechanisms for these response differences. 82</page><page sequence="13">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors gratefully acknowledge the support and guidance of Nopporn Khaewpong, Rolf Eppinger, Shashi Kuppa, and Mark Haffner of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
