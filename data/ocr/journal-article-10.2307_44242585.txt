<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORKSHOPS AND REGIONAL VARIATION OF DAUNIAN STELAI: OBSERVATIONS BASED ON TWO STELAI IN GENEVA* Camilla Norman The colloquium 'There and Back Again: archeologie méditerranéenne entre Suisse et Australie'' provides me with the perfect opportunity to present the beginnings of a new avenue of enquiry on a topic close to my heart. As a former student of Jean-Paul Descoeudres at the University of Sydney, I am happy to be able to offer something fresh on two artefacts to be found in Geneva, where he continued his career after leaving Australia: the Daunian statue-stelai from the Collection M.N. and the Association Hellas et Roma, both held in the Musée d'art et d'histoire. Professor Descœudres ignited my fascination with the Daunian stelai over two decades ago while on fieldwork in South Italy, and they have formed the core of my studies ever since. The stelai comprise the largest homogeneous group of proto-historic sculpture in the West, yet find few parallels and so largely escape attention. Nonetheless, they are a veritable mine of information on numerous traditions and social practices of the Archaic Daunians that cannot otherwise be detected in the material record and as such provide critical documentation for pre-Roman Italy. The two stelai in Geneva, one published in full here for the first time, are no exception. One depicts a female and the other a male, both near complete and shown in all their finery, and both carrying further figurative imagery illuminating Daunian practices. Moreover, both can be attributed to specific workshops, allowing for a clearer picture of the creation, function, and development of the entire corpus of these enigmatic monuments. The stelai are anthropomorphic, each being a single slab of limestone incised on all sides to show a human figure in richly decorated robes, with arms held symmetrically across the chest. They stand anywhere between 30 and 160 cm in height. The men carry armour and weaponry, consisting of a 'heart protector' ( cardiophylax j, a sword, and a circular shield (pl. 8: 1), while the women are adorned with jewellery (necklaces, fibulae, and various pendants), have raised shoulders, wear aprons, and have decorated arms probably representing tattoos (pl. 8: 2).1 All incised elements were further picked out with colour, namely black, red, and white, of which today only faint traces remain. The heads of the stelai are rarely found in association with their bodies. They were delineated, standing atop the slab, either carved with facial features or left plain. Those of the females were hewn from the same block of stone as the body and are roughly conical in shape, representing what may be a hide, wicker, or felt hat. The heads of the males were carved from a separate block and attached to the body by means of a post and dowel. They are typically spherical; rivet holes suggest some had added headgear. Drawn within the geometric borders of the stelai 's robes, figured imagery is sometimes present. The subject-matter depicted is varied and encompasses scenes of both everyday and spiritual life: images of hunting, fishing, weaving, grinding grain, and feasting, of libation ceremonies, processions, and funerary games, of chariots and warfare, and arguably even of This paper was completed during a 6-month residency at the British School at Rome as the Coleman-Hilton Scholar.

Not one Daunian stele has been found in its primary context and very few under excavation conditions. Even recorded find-spots are rare.2 On stylistic grounds and based on comparisons of the items they carry with actual counterparts in the material record, the stelai have been dated to between the mid-7th and the early 5th cent, bc.3 They provide the only self-representation we have for the Daunians of this period, as unlike many of their neighbours the Daunians did not include figures in the decoration of painted pottery or in wall paintings, and did not produce architectural sculptures or figurines. Anthro- and zoomorphic figures only appear occasionally as protomes and handles on matt-painted pottery. Furthermore, the Daunians did not adopt writing and are only rarely mentioned in ancient literary sources. An appreciation of their stelai is thus key to any understanding of Daunian social and religious life. Only a handful of Daunian stelai are today found in collections outside northern Apulia and the Melfese, their place of manufacture (fig. 1). The vast majority are housed in the National Museum of Manfredonia, near ancient Siponto, the main centre of their production. A significant collection is also held in nearby Trinitapoli, in the proximity of ancient Salapia, a secondary production centre for the stelai. Together, the two collections hold some 1,320 of the approximately 1,380 known stelai. Otherwise, there is a sprinkling of Daunian stelai in other collections across Apulia, north of the Ofanto River, and in Melfi; a few have found their way out of Italy altogether. This distribution appears to be a direct result of the processes by which the stelai were rediscovered in modern times, those in Manfredonia having been gathered under the direction of Silvio Ferri,4 those in Trinitapoli by the local archaeology club,5 and the remainder representing chance finds that were not swept up in the field-walking campaigns of the 1960s and 70s.6 These chance finds, often coming from outside the main zone of production, regularly display stylistic anomalies which are suggestive of regional manufacture - as characterized by at least one of the Genevan Figure 1 .

Identifying regional variation among the Daunian stelai significantly aids a fuller understanding of their overall development and use. DETECTING WORKSHOPS- WHY? It is important to enquire into the production of these stelai because we have so little other information about them: they have come to us devoid of primary contexts, their stylistic and chronological development is open to debate, and so is their function. We do not know whom these monuments honoured, under what circumstances, or exactly why. A comparative study of other Bronze Age and Iron Age European statue-stelai suggests that they were almost certainly linked to death, not necessarily used to mark individual graves, but to evoke the memory of ancestors.7 The elaborate garb and lavish accoutrements depicted as being worn by the figure represented by each stele, and the sheer man-hours that would have gone into making a stele, point to an important ceremonial setting most likely centred upon the elite. Yet the question is complex: Daunian society does not appear to have been particularly stratified; some stelai have been found reused in burials and buildings that must date only decades after their initial erection; and, intriguingly, there are five times as many female stelai as there are male. The nature of the ritual behaviour connected to the stelai is cloudy at best. It is possible to identify microstyle groups within the corpus: sub-groups of stelai linked by common stylistic and technical properties. These microstyle groups, judging from the stelai 's modern distribution and what little is known of their find-spots and geological composition,8 can be said to correspond to Charles Redman's 'analytical individual': a group of works that are intimately related and may be the product of one hand, or multiple hands working in close connection.9 It is not important which, an individual or a workshop. However, given the large numbers of stelai in certain microstyle groups, and since in my opinion it is possible on occasion to detect two hands on the one stele, I prefer to use the latter term. The exercise is not intended to reveal the 'real man' - the personality behind the making of the stelai - but to identify patterns concerning the production of the stelai over time and place so that we might better understand their development and, ultimately, the reasons and mechanisms behind their making. It is immediately clear from a particular group predominant in the Trinitapoli collection, for example, that proportionally more male stelai were made in Salapia than elsewhere and that the workshop responsible for this output was in operation towards the end of the period in which Daunian stelai were made. Identifying workshops has additional benefits, such as helping to trace differing scales of production, stylistic approaches, and subject preferences. Although the 'idiom' ofDaunian stelai is remarkably consistent, details in the rendering of attributes and choice of imagery vary, and their production waxes and wanes over time and place. It is not so much the artisan that we seek in applying the tool of attribution to the Daunian stelai, but the consumer. Numerous scholars have sustained a lengthy discussion over the feasibility, worth, and ethics of attribution studies in archaeology and art history. In the words of Richard Neer, 'such debate will not have an end, which is a sign not of triviality, but of seriousness'.10 It is not my intention 7 C. Norman, 'European Statue-stelae: from Deity to Individual', in: R. Storli (ed.), TO ATOMO. Representation of the Individual (forthcoming). 8 According to Nava op. cit. (n. 5) 25, 30-43, the stelai from Trinitapoli have undergone fabric analysis, though the exact nature of this testing is not made transparent, and the precise results remain unpublished. However, the apparent indication is that different stone quarries were used in different localities, and possibly over different time frames. The feel, appearance, and working properties of the stone used for the stelai are certainly variable and seem to correlate to microstyles. 9 'The "analytical individual" and prehistoric style variability', in: J. N. Hill- J. Gunn (eds.), The Individual in Prehistory: Studies of Variability in Style in Prehistoric Technologies (1977) 41-53. 10 R.

For current purposes, I adhere not to the traditional concept of connoisseurship as a largely aesthetic discipline foremost concerned with attributing works to the hand of a single artist,14 but instead to that sought by Neer: connoisseurship as 'a form of etiology: the inference of an artefact's spatial and temporal point of origin on the basis of morphological ('stylistic') criteria'.15 He goes on to elaborate: 'that point of origin can be as specific as a person or as general as a place; it is all the same as far as theory and practice are concerned. That is, the connoisseur who attributes a painting to Rembrandt is performing the same actions, and for the same reasons, as the field archaeologist who sorts her finds at the end of a day's work. When the archaeologist classifies a newly excavated potsherd as Naxian Geometric or al-Ubaid ware, she is using connoisseurial method: determining origin on the basis of style. Connoisseurship differs from ordinary pottery sorting only in degree, not in kind.'16 For Neer, style is all-pervading and its recognition, given the correct 'cognitive stock' is, like language, communal and transferable. Our knowledge of the distant past relies entirely on the perception of style, be it pictorial, written, or indeed the result of any human, animal or natural endeavour. It relies on attribution. DETECTING WORKSHOPS- HOW? The method used to determine the collective output of a Daunian stele workshop is much the same as that first used by J. D. Beazley to classify Attic black- and red-figured pottery and since applied in other fields of archaeology, to varying effect; at present most notably to certain artefact classes from Aegean prehistory including Minoan glyptics,17 marble Cycladic figurines,18 and Mycenaean pictorial pottery.19 Christine Morris, in her study of the latter, foreshadows the position on connoisseurship here adopted when she writes that 'attribution studies need not be an end in themselves, but are one of the many levels at which stylistic analysis operates, and, as such, can be usefully and more fully integrated into the study of material culture'.20 The stylistic analysis of Daunian stelai that aims to identify microstyle groups relies upon a constellation of factors, including fabric type, morphology, manufacturing techniques, and details of design and execution. It is these last two elements that provides the most telling signs 1 1 Recent work on embodied practices and the cognitive life of artefacts is already adding weight to the discussion surrounding the practicability and value of attribution studies in archaeology. See, e.g., J. Sutton-N. Keene, 'Cognitive History and Material Culture', in: D. Gaimster-T. Hamling-C. Richardson (eds.), The Ashgate Research Companion to Material Culture in Early Modern Europe (forthcoming). 12 For a thoughtful discussion on this topic, see J. Cherry, 'Beazley in the Bronze Age?

No single detail defines a workshop; it is the combination and relationship of very many, repeated on a number of stelai, which allows attribution. Daunian stelai in fact lend themselves to attribution nicely, fulfilling Morris's ideal conditions for such a study. Their design displays technique in addition to form, they are homogeneous in time and place, and they have a limited design set by which to gauge variability.21 James Hill, following on from John Cherry's discussion on the conditions allowing for the successful attribution of the Knossos Linear B tablets,22 puts it in a slightly different manner: 'l) there must be numerous examples of precisely the same product...; 2) the product must exhibit sufficient complexity to make it possible to measure the individual variation and; 3) the product must have been made by more than a single individual (but significantly fewer individuals than there are examples of the product)'.23 Again the criteria are met. For the Daunian stelai there is of course no identified corpus of a known artistic personality such as Hill would wish for, whose absence he claims 'makes attribution studies almost impossible in the usual prehistoric context'.24 This, however, is beside the point when one is not in search of a Master. The plausibility of identifying Daunian stelai workshops has been previously noted by Maria Luisa Nava and myself, and through our intimacy with the monuments we have both felt able to mention certain groups in passing, but until now no formal study has been published on the topic (excepting Nava's largely descriptive article cataloguing a number of stelai from Tiati25). The current paper is merely the beginning of the task: it focuses on just the two workshops to which the stelai from Geneva can be attributed. Both stelai are stylistically diverse yet can be placed within a microstyle group, the other members of which give hints as to the place of manufacture, thanks to their find-spots or their current location. One of the workshops can tentatively be traced to Arpi, the other to Siponto. The stelai from outside the main production zones, such as those from Arpi, in fact offer the best starting point when endeavouring to identify workshops, as they tend to be more idiosyncratic and come with the occasional recorded find-spot. One only has to look at the few fragments from the Melfese, whose provenances are all at least roughly attested, to see the existence of regional variability and, ipso facto, for a society with the social complexity of the Daunians, individual artisans or workshops (even if they were not necessarily full-time specialists). The Melfese is an area situated on the boundary of Daunian and Lucanian territory, in the Lower Apennines, through which the Ofanto River runs. Its valley represents an important route linking Daunia to the Tyrrhenian coast and the Gulf of Taranto which gave rise to contact, albeit limited, with the Campanian Etruscans and the Greek settlers of Magna Graecia. In Archaic times, when the stelai were being made, the people of the Melfese were culturally aligned with the Daunians, but not strictly so. Their material culture shows wider interactions with other societies as well as local innovation. The few stele fragments that have been found in this region clearly follow the Daunian model but have a decidedly different character. 21 Ibid. 46. 22 Cherry art. cit.

Table 1 : Daunian stelai from the Melfese. Omitting that from contrada Carozze, which is in itself unique, the Melfese fragments number five in total.27 They are all relatively small, preserving only sections of the borders of the figures' robes and in one case the point of a petal from the rosette adorning a shield. The stone used - judging from a rudimentary visual and tactile appraisal - is distinct.28 Logic suggests it is of local origin. The textiles depicted on these stelai are all decorated with meanders, which probably has more to do with chronology than place of manufacture. That is, meanders were the fashion of the day, rather than a motif favoured by any particular individual artisan or consumer. Their presence on all the Melfese fragments does, however, allow for direct comparison between them as it signposts that the pieces are contemporary; the similarities in particular meander types used in addition to their arrangement and style of execution speak of a shared pedigree. There can be no doubt, for example, that the fragments from Bella Casa (Lavello) and Montelupino (Banzi) are by the same individual. The incision on both is unusually wide and deep and has been achieved with mechanical assistance, not freehand. The lines are straight and rigid, probably having been cut with the help of a ruler. The set of concentric circles on the tip of the shield's petal on the 26 The number in brackets refers to the labelling system used in Norman 2013, where the stelai have been divided into three groups, each with running numbers beginning from 001 and its own prefix. 'F' denotes a female stele, 'M' a male stele, and 'U' a stelai of unknown gender (i.e. the fragment is too small/ anomalous to be sexed). 27 The Carozze piece is a large fragment of the lower portion of a female stele. It has numerous unusual properties, such as the form and placement of the 'Greek-key' running meander decorating its borders. Without having seen the stele in person, and only a photograph of one side, it would be imprudent to assign a particular provenance to this singular piece. 28 I have not sighted Lavello 1 19378 in person nor in print. According to A. Bottini, Principi guerrieri della Daunia del VII secolo: le tombe principesche di Lavello (1982) 35 n. 12, it is comparable to Melfi 52986.</page><page sequence="7">Workshops and Regional Variation ofDaunian Stelai 69 Bella Casa fragment would have been made with a five-pronged drill, the central prong acting as the fulcrum around which the outer prongs described increasingly larger circles in a single action. Furthermore, both pieces have the same quatrefoil meander placed, unusually, squarely rather than on the oblique. The remaining three Melfese fragments may not neccessarily be by the same hand, but nonetheless possess a number of striking similarities: the firmness of incision, a heightened sense of symmetry, the selection of relatively simple meanders in unfused boxes and, where it can be seen, the extension of these meanders onto the sides and tops of the stele also. These fragments from the Melfese provide a snapshot in time and place. The similarities in the patterns used in the textiles of these stelai indicate that they were manufactured in close chronological proximity; the manner in which the patterns were deployed and executed indicates a close relationship between their makers. The group is a humble one and yet, with the benefit of known find-spots, serves to illustrate that it is possible to identify workshops for the Daunian stelai. It shows not only the presence of Daunians in the region, but also the mindset and practice that accompanied the ritual surrounding their stelai. Larger and better preserved groups, especially if they can be geographically located, should prove even more helpful in revealing something more ofDaunian society. THE 'ARPI WORKSHOP' The stele from the M.N. Collection (henceforth F665), on display in the Musée d'art et d'histoire in Geneva, is missing only its right shoulder and head (pl. 9: l).29 It stands at a relatively diminutive 58 cm and represents a female, as is immediately evident by the raised shoulders, necklace, fibulae and fibula pendants, stringed apron, belt, and hip and skirt pendants. The subsidiary figurative decoration on the back two panels also falls within the norm for female stelai. Above is a scene of two women (identifiable by their long plaits) working at a standing loom. The woman to the left holds out a vase towards the loom, while the seated woman at right is weaving.30 In the lower panel two women face each other, one balancing a pot upon her head and the other perhaps holding out her pot between them (a break in the stele makes it difficult to tell). The depiction of such pots is not uncommon on Daunian stelai. They are used to signify the female and, unless an instrument in a libation/purification scene, are always found balanced upon the head. The hand-held pots on F665 are unusual, but there is much else about this stele that is also atypical: the lack of arms; the patterning of the robes; the style of the fibulae; the type of fibula pendants; the presence of two hip pendants (one on either side of the slab), at least one with a rosette; the triangular apron panel; the designs on the rear of the belt; the attention to detail in the figurative imagery (such as the decorated borders of the women's robes); the unevenness of incision. The overall syntax is the same as for most other female stelai, but the treatment and execution are distinctive. There are a number of stelai devoid of arms; however, they differ in composition. They are more abstracted, some showing no more than a textile border and fibula with pendant, and they never carry subsidiary figurative imagery (e.g., Manfredonia 1566). They probably represent the 29 J. Chamay, L'art des peuples italiques 3000 à 300 avant J.-C. (1993) 368-9 cat. n° 244. 30 Chamay (ibid. 367) rejects this interpretation and, following on from S. Ferri, instead suggests it is a ritual libation scene with the vertical element forming part of a naiskos or chapel housing an enthroned divinity. Reference to the remaining, not insubstantial corpus of weaving scenes on the Daunian stelai, as well as other Italic depictions of standing looms such as that on the Verruchio throne, leaves no room for doubt as to the scene's correct identification.

F665, with its figured scenes, flat neckline, high squared shoulders, and abundant use of circles, is better placed in the early to mid-6th century. The use of navicella rather than arch fibulae push it towards the end of this time span. Its lack of arms denotes not a chronological development, but regional variation. F665 finds parallels with nine other stelai, that together form a group which I have called the 'Arpi workshop'. Stele Dimensions Fragment Selected Publications . 1flA , . Nava 1980 cat. no. 182; A.

It can be seen that of the six female stelai in the Arpi workshop four carry two fibulae, the upper one of which is sometimes shown in profile. The manner in which they have been depicted and the treatment of the terminals with small concentric circles is found on no other stele, nor is the combination of profile and plan views. Normally navicella fibulae are shown from above and take on a far more geometric form, being constructed entirely from straight lines. The Arpi fibulae are more shapely. Likewise, the use of small concentric circles on the fibula pendants, and the forms that these pendants take, are without parallel (pl. 10: 1). The remaining two stelai in the group do not preserve their fibulae, but traces of the lower fibula pendant hanging over the belt of F677 shows that it, too, is depicted in this manner. 31 Nava's 'Type 5' stelai: Nava 1980, 20-1, 25-6; 1988, 190- 92, and see figs. 204-5 for Manfredonia 1566. 32 Although illustrated side by side in Nava 1988, this join was first pointed out by F. Salomone: A. Pontrandolfo et al ., 'Alcuni esempi figurativi dell Italia antica', in: R. Olmos Romero -J. A. Santos Velasco, Iconographía Iberica, Iconografia Itálica: propuestas de interpretación y lecture (1996) 311 fig. 32.</page><page sequence="9">Workshops and Regional Variation ofDaunian Stelai 71 There are numerous other tell-tale indicators that these six stelai were all produced in the same workshop. At least one (F306: pl. 11: 1) has no arms. Those of the two that definitively do (Fl 07: pl. 9: 2 and F669: pl. 10: 2) are rendered in the same, distinctive fashion: large hands and shortened arms bent at right-angles and emerging directly from the borders of the robe with barely a break in the fabric, fingers held together and thumbs proud, and almost identical tattoos. When preserved, the yokes of the garments depicted on these stelai are flat, the raised shoulders square instead of rounded. Their aprons are pulled tight rather than hanging loose, and at least three are of the unusual triangular shape (F665: pl. 9: 1, F669: pl. 10: 2, F677: pl. 11: 3). Another notable feature of these stelai is the proliferation of hip pendants upon them. The hip pendant is an attribute exclusive to the female stelai, but not a necessary one.33 Of the 691 female stelai known to me, some 66 carry them. Only four stelai demonstrably carry two hip pendants, three of which are in the Arpi group (F3 1 1, F665, F669). F107 has one at least on the right side (the left side is only partially preserved), no published details exist for the sides of F677 (the current whereabouts of which is unclear), and the relevant areas of F306 are missing, although comparison of the upper terminal designs of the hip pendants on F107, F665, and F669 strongly suggests it carried one on at least the left side. As a hip pendant is only ever worn on the left side if the right side also sports one, it most probably had two. It thus is quite possible that each of the six female stelai in this group were in the rare position of being given a hip pendant on both sides. Furthermore, the type of hip pendant is remarkable and consistent. Rather than the usual plain disc/ring hung from a triple strap, the Arpi stelai have a disc decorated with a rosette, hung from a long thin strap with a W-shaped terminal at top, directly below a meander box (see pls. 9: 2; 10: 1-2).34 There is an uncommon preference also for belt pendants enhanced with further decoration among this group. In this particular instance we may be seeing regional variation not in terms of artisanal practice and consumer demand, but a reflection of real-life fashion and local traditional costume. F665 stands at one end of the spectrum of the Arpi group. A stylistic sequence can be traced from it to F669 and F 107, where most of the other stelai in the group cluster (the direction of the sequence in chronological terms is uncertain). This can be observed most clearly in the patterning of the fabrics used in the robes of the stelai. Fabric pattern type - be it circles, running meanders, meanders, or crosses - is a major factor in constructing any typology for the Daunian stelai and for understanding their stylistic and chronological development. The specific type of those patterns selected, and the way in which they are executed, oriented, and put together, is a major factor in identifying workshops. It can be seen that the fabric patterning of the Arpi workshop is executed in a freehand, at times almost sketchy, fashion. Even though the execution of the personal adornments and subsidiary figurative imagery is usually sure-handed and well defined, the patterning on the robes is often relatively light. The patterns selected for F665, the Geneva stele, are circles and meanders - a surprisingly rare combination. Although it is the only stele of the six on which the circle is used; it is connected to the group by its meanders, the construction of the vast majority of which is almost unique, being comprised of grids on the oblique in boxes with alternating blank and decorated squares. F669 is the only other Daunian stele to carry such meanders, but it also features other meander types that link it to the remaining stelai of the Arpi group. Among them is the oblique swastika with double bends encased by a band which performs two outward-facing curls at both top and bottom, a motif that is especially favoured in this workshop. There is also a marked preference for the swastika/quatrefoil meander placed uncharacteristically on the flat rather than in the typical diagonal orientation. 33 C. Norman, 'Hip Pendants and Cardiophylax Ribbons: Towards a Better Understanding ofDaunian Stelai', Meditarch 21,2008, 12-17. 34 Only the left proper hip pendant of F669 is without a rosette.</page><page sequence="10">72 Camilla Norman Taking into consideration, among other aspects, the fabric type depicted, shared manufacturing techniques, and the detail and kind of secondary imagery on the six female stelai, it is possible to add one fragment of indeterminable gender to the group (U233: pl. 8: 3) as well as at least two (M103: pl. 12: 3, M140: pl. 12: 1) and possibly three (M54: pl. 12: 2) male stelai.35 One obvious uniting factor is the presence of the elaborate meander described above, seen on no other Daunian stelai. Note also the foreshortened arms of M54 and M140, and the unusual use of the rosette on the boss of their cardiophylakes which replicates the females' pendants; the addition of circles to the fabric of M140's robes; the large diamond-shaped or drilled eyes of the human figures and animals portrayed in the subsidiary imagery. That four of these 10 stelai are not held in the Manfredonia or Trinitapoli collections and that one has been found only in recent times (Ml 03) is noteworthy. It suggests that all five were not discovered in the campaigns initiated by Ferri in the area around ancient Siponto and Salapia and that they most likely hail from outside the main zone of production. Indeed, M 103 was found in the environs of Arpi, as was reportedly M54.36 Other stelai are known from Arpi that do not fall within this group, indicating that this was not the only workshop in the locality. It is, however, by far the best represented today. THE 'CROSSES B WORKSHOP' The stele belonging to the Association Hellas et Roma and held in the storeroom of the Musée d'art et d'histoire in Geneva (henceforth M135), is in three pieces (pl. 13). When placed together they form an almost complete male stele standing at c. 92 cm, with only the head and portions of both sides missing. The upper two fragments (HR284), published by J. Chamay,37 show the arms and hands of the main figure and his cardiophylax on the front and a figurative scene on the back. The scene is badly worn: all that can be made out are the legs of a horse to the left (that may once have had a rider), a dog and a bird towards the centre, and a quadruped at top right. The quadruped is perhaps another dog, certainly not a deer: the scene is pastoral, not one of hunting. The upper edge of the stele's shield is just visible at the bottom of the smaller fragment. The lower fragment (HR285), published here for the first time, shows the remainder of the stele from the waist down.38 The cross-bar sword typical of male Daunian stelai is depicted on the front, and a circular shield on the back. The shield is without parallel, not in its design or form, but in its size and placement. Customarily the shield is larger, spanning the full width of the slab and cutting into the decorative borders of the robes. It dominates the back of any male stele. Here the shield is small; tucked between the borders and devoid of any strapping, it looks almost like an afterthought. The shield is decorated with a vortex, a design seen on 15 other Daunian stelai (out of 72 with known shield devices) and evidenced also in the figurative iconography, as well as in depictions of indigenous Italic males on South Italian red-figured pottery. The Archaic warrior panoply of circular shield and cross-bar sword is well attested in this part of Italy, notably in 'princely tombs' such as those at Braida di Vaglio.39 35 M54 is unique in itself, being the only male stele to have a protective culet at back, and one of only two to wear an apron. The apron is fringed with decorative pendants very like those found on F3 1 1 . The incision for the textile borders on both these stelai is more regular and not as sketchy as for the remainder of the Arpi workshop stelai. 36 Nava 20 1 1 , p. 24 n. 2 1 ; A. M.

It was a happy by-product of my time in Geneva for the 'There and Back Again' colloquium that I was able to examine these pieces and identify the join. Until then I had been unaware of the lower fragment's existence as it had not been recognized as Daunian. 39 Bottini op. cit. (n. 28).</page><page sequence="11">Workshops and Regional Variation ofDaunian Stelai 73 Figurative scenes appear on the front and back of the fragment. On the front, a monstrous beast is incised to the left of the cardiophylax ribbons, in the vein of those creatures seen on Manfredonia 802 (lower back, bottom register), Manfredonia 805 (lower back, right), Manfredonia 1008 (right shoulder), and Sansone IP1 1+520 (below left hand).40 To the right of the ribbons are a worn, unidentifiable figure above and a bird below. The main scene, across the bottom of the stele, is of a warrior armed with shield, spear, and crested helmet mounted on a horse at left, facing a bare-headed warrior with shield and spear on foot at right. On the back, below the diminutive shield, there is a dog chasing a hare in the top register, both running to the left, above a bird. The bottom register shows three standing warriors, each with a circular shield. The incision is light and, again, worn. The sides of the slab carry a string of lozenges at top and bottom. The waist is demarcated with a circle and the extant shoulder with the same simplified lozenge-and-cross pattern seen in the front hem of the stele's robe. There are a number of anomalies about this stele. Again the syntax is standard, but certain details are divergent. The small size of the shield has already been mentioned. Notable also is the cardiophylax. The double-axe shape is typical, but its central boss in the form of a rosette is only seen on seven other stelai, two of which we have attributed to the Arpi workshop (M54 and M 140). More remarkable are the strapping and ribbons, which on M 135 take an unparalleled form. Rather than the usual ensemble of a solid section between yoke and cardiophylax and cardiophylax and sword (here missing) with two separate rectangular ribbons trailing below the sword,41 the cardiophylax of M 135 is held in place by a continuous ribbon with three vertical lines above and four below. The incision on the stele is rough and its composition clumsy: witness the uneven meander boxes on either side of the lower front, the asymmetrical chape protecting the tip of the sword, the missing legs of the mounted warrior, the awkward treatment of the stele's upper arms, and its six-fingered (sic!) hands. Nonetheless, M 135 is not without parallels. The upper portion of a male stele consisting of two fragments (M71: pl. 14: 1), a partial female stele consisting of five fragments (F165: pl. 14: 2), and a further five fragments (F65: pl. 15: 1, M93: 15: 3, U258: pl. 15: 2, U268: pl. 15: 4, U315: pl. 15: 5) are very likely from the same workshop.42 1 have termed it the 'Crosses B workshop', after a particular pattern found in the robes of these stelai which is unique to the group and which I define in my typology of fabric designs as follows: a series of rectangles containing a vertical cross surrounded by concentric lozenges. The inner-most lozenge has radiating arms extending towards, but not touching, the centre of the cross. The tips of the outer lozenges are often truncated by the surrounding rectangle. There may be more than one cross- and-lozenge motif within a rectangle, usually in a string.43 This motif is rare and conspicuous enough for its presence alone to warrant a fragment's inclusion in the group. There are of course other factors uniting these pieces: the sketchy incision and frequently irregular composition, the addition of circles within the fabric and upon the belts of the females, and a predilection for subsidiary figurative imagery that borders on horror vacui. It is difficult to say a great deal more about the smaller fragments. It is a shame that this workshop is not better represented, because the glimpses of figurative imagery we have from it point to a wealth of subject-matter and a level of naturalism rarely seen on other Daunian stelai. Of the larger examples, F165 (pl. 14: 2) preserves a cultic scene below the left arm, representing two seated women in tall pointed hats facing one another over a tripod cauldron. A variation of this vignette is seen on at least 15 other stelai, all but one of them female. This follows a pattern 40 Nava 1980 cat. nos. 612, 615, and 775; Nava 1988, 42-5 fig. 43. 41 Norman art. cit.

Daunian stelai from the 'Crosses B workshop'. that sees women as the main protagonists of ceremony and ritual on the Daunian stelai. On the upper back of F165 there is what would have been the representation of a type of joust, involving two warriors armed with shield and spear facing each other on horses. It is not unusual, as in this instance, that the figures are shown standing on top of their horse rather than astride it. One suspects that it is artistic licence and not a reflection of actual practice, even if the Daunians were renowned horsemen.46 The joust - possibly performed as part of funerary games - is found on 11 other stelai, nine of them male. Little of the imagery on M71 (pl. 14: 1) is preserved: some birds and a bird catcher, pointing to a pastoral theme. The 'Crosses B group' is a beguiling one. It speaks of an idiosyncratic workshop with a limited output, one that was perhaps not long-lived and probably representative of a single artisan with an individualistic approach to the work. That all the pieces by this hand other than M 135 can be found in the Manfredonia collection suggests, but does not argue definitively for, a Sipontine provenance. On stylistic grounds, I would place it roughly in the mid-6th century bc. SOME SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS Other than for the Geneva stele F665, the subsidiary figurative imagery of the Arpi workshop has not been discussed in detail. It is extensive and has been published elsewhere (see Table 2). It is worth noting, however, that F665 is the only female stele in this group to carry imagery relating to weaving and/or the procession, by far the two most prevalent scene types to be found on female Daunian stelai and which most probably relate to the ceremonies surrounding marriage.47 Instead, the imagery is of martial pursuits, such as the armed warriors sparring on the lower back of F 107 (pl. 12), typically associated with male stelai and not at all common on 44 These associations have been identified by the author. 45 U258 is very probably male. One side is badly damaged, but the preserved side shows a section of the robes plus a diagonal stripe that may well be the strapping used to secure a shield. 46 M. Tagliente, 'I signori dei cavalli nella Daunia di età arcaica', Annali della Facoltà di Lettere e Filosofìa dell'Università degli Studi di Perugia 23, 1986, 305-21. 47 Norman art. cit. (n. 30).</page><page sequence="13">Workshops and Regional Variation ofDaunian Stelai 75 female examples. Within the Arpi group there is also a marked partiality for pastoral scenes, as with the figure on the back of F677 leading a bull, seen in part again on U233 (pl. 8: 3). Together they account for half the known bovine scenes. In the latter instance the man leading the bull carries a spear. Does he lead the animal to its sacrifice at the behest of the enthroned priestess above? The chair on which she sits denotes either a weaving scene or one of ritual, as in the tripod-cauldron scene under the apron of F3 1 1 that is repeated on the right breast of M 140 (pl. 12: 1) and perhaps again in the upper register of the lower back panel of F669 (pl. 10: 2). This combination of ritual, martial games, and pastoral scenes perhaps points to funerary ceremonies. Are we seeing a reflection of differing consumer demand, even a slight variation in ideological priorities, among the inhabitants of Arpi?48 The market for the Daunian stelai was most probably inherently conservative. In all likelihood these monuments were used by the elite to honour, if not their recently deceased, their ancestors. Certainly they would have been used as a means of displaying wealth, power, and social identity. The broader cultural identity and burial practices of a people tend to shift only slowly in the absence of upheaval or major change, and so social inferences drawn from the stelai, if done scientifically, should be well founded. It is rewarding that by identifying workshops we might say not only more about the Daunian stelai, but about the various groups of people who made and utilized them. It may be for some a bridge too far to accept the notion that the Arpini had a heightened interest in the legacy of death rather than marriage at the time of passing; at least we might consent that the Arpini had a fondness for particularly elaborate personal adornment while living, and that somewhere in the Gulf of Manfredonia a renegade stele maker was briefly at work. Nonetheless, even with what I hope have been healthy servings of explicit methodology and larger doses of social archaeology, the results are to be taken with a grain of salt.49 48 The figurative imagery for the 'Crosses B workshop' appears to follow a similar atypical pattern. However, the comparison is superficial at best. The corpus is far too limited and fragmentary for any useful theories to be derived from it. 49 Cherry art. cit.
