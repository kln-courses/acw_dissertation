<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND FIELD WORK IN THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION C. Ε. V. Nixon (ed.) PELLA (JORDAN): 1993 A short season of excavations at Pella in Jordan took place between late September and early October in 1993.' The work was limited to further investigations in Area XXIX, the site of the Abbasid-period (750-969) town centre and khan built following the great earthquake in 747/8 that terminated the Late Antique city. A small team of six undertook the work, aided by fourteen workmen. We are most grateful for the continued support of Professor Safwan Tell, Director-General of the Department of Antiquities, and the interest of Η. E. Mr John Shepherd, Australia's Ambassador to Jordan, and Mrs Shepherd.2 Area XXIX is located on a low clay mound in the Wadi Khandak, 150 m north-east of the central tell. A survey of surface remains in 1985 identified two large and essentially rectangular structures, termed the Eastern and Western Complexes. Two major seasons of excavation during 1989 and 1990 concentrated on the Eastern Complex, exposing a large, stone-built structure erected in the second half of the 8th century.3 The 1993 season involved the final excavation of unfinished loci and standing baulks in preparation for consolidation work scheduled for 1994. The work addressed a number of outstanding problems remaining from the 1989 and 1990 seasons, especially details of architectural phasing and the chronology of the Eastern Complex. This building featured substantial inward-facing rooms around a central courtyard, with evidence for a second storey (staircases, thick mudbrick collapse). The uncovering of a large kitchen area adjacent to the courtyard was a major discovery of the season. The later history of the complex saw extra rooms added to the east; these did not communicate directly with the courtyard building but were entered from the outside. Two major phases of occupation can now be identified: (1) The 'official' period, during which the Eastern Complex served its original administrative and commercial functions. (2) A 'domestic' phase characterized by the growing private use of rooms. The blocking of doorways and the addition of rooms to make small units, plus the presence of many tabuns, suggests family usage, although this does not necessarily preclude a continuing official/ commercial purpose. The ceramic material indicates that this second phase of occupation extended into the Fatimid period, perhaps reaching the early 11th century. In addition to an expanded ceramic repertoire, the season recovered 23 non-ceramic objects including a knife and nails of iron, a sizeable segment of a steatite bowl decorated with circles and incisions, a two-ended decorated bone comb with -wide and fine teeth, beads and a beaker of glass, and pendants of shell and malachite. Six copper coins were also found during the season. Currently these coins are being cleaned, but an initial appraisal suggests that thev are all of a ore-Islamic date.

The aim of the project is to investigate the nature of Middle Bronze Age occupation in the upper wadi al-'Ajib. Work was conducted under the auspices of the University of Sydney and the British Institute at Amman for Archaeology and History by kind permission of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan and Dr Ghazi Bisheh, Director General of Antiquities. The Department of Antiquities inspector was Mr Khalid al-Jbour. Work was funded through private donations.

Preliminary surveys have shown a concentration of Middle Bronze Age sites along the wadi from the Syrian border southwards until the land falls away sharply east of the village of Amra wa Ameira. Below this the rainfall is too low for effective dry farming. Simple diversion canals and field systems on small patches of flood plain suggest that irrigation agriculture has been practised in antiquity. Some such systems may be associated with the Middle Bronze Age settlements. Ancient field walls still visible on the upper slopes of the wadi sides may also indicate dry farming. The work of the Project has been focused on the major site of Rukeis, north of the village of Dafiyaneh and close to the Syrian border. Rukeis consists of a large fortified enclosure with a spread of settlement beyond the walls to the south and east. The wadi cuts against the northern flank of the fortified enclosure. Within the main walls, the main occupation deposits are of Middle Bronze Age date stratified above a settlement of the EB I period. Outside the walls a spread of Middle Bronze Age settlement overlies further EB I occupation levels. Along the wadi above and below the site is a spread of small Middle Bronze Age settlements consisting of a few stone buildings, some contained within low enclosure walls. There is also sporadic evidence for limited later use of the site. Sherd scatters include evidence of Iron Age, Roman, and Islamic use. A pit excavated on the upper tell produced Iron Age pottery, a female figurine, and an ostracon jiated on ceramic and paleographic grounds to the 9th century bc. On the western summit of the main tell is a rectangular structure which appears to be of the Roman period, rebuilt earlier this century by a Druzi settler. Against the outer face of the main fortification wall on the south-east side is a pile of burnt limestone and chert representing waste from lime kilns. Similar kilns are known from elsewhere in the region and may also be Roman in date, although the lack of ceramic evidence makes this difficult to prove. Several cisterns are located around the southern margins of the site. The date of these is also unclear. AREA SURVEY AND EXCAVATION t The nature and location of the Middle Bronze Age sites is relatively uniform and the settlements are contemporary with the main stages of Middle Bronze Age occupation at Rukeis. The large quantities of storage jar fragments and variety of stone artefacts suggest that the sites may have been farmsteads, although it is not clear whether the occupation was permanent or seasonal. Site 38 Site 38 is situated roughly 400 m north-west of Rukeis on a rise on the north side of the wadi. Near the site is a small cistern made by plastering the inner face of a lava-flow cave. The site consists of a roughly rectangular enclosure wall with long rectangular internal structures. Two phases of occupation were identified. A floor or packed surface abutted the base of the walls, and below this was evidence of earlier occupation deposits lying on sterile soil into which two small pits were cut. These contained the remains of storage jars which may have been set into the ground for support. Both phases of occupation date to the Middle Bronze Age. The walls of the upper phase were preserved to a height of about 1.25 m. There was a doorway in the southern wall. In the west section a column of stones may be the remains of a roof support. Site 42 Site 42 is situated roughly 600 m north-east of Rukeis on a rise on the north side of the wadi. There is a large cistern close by. The site consists of an enclosure wall with traces of rectangular stone structures visible on the surface. One phase of occupation can be dated to</page><page sequence="4">116 Australian and New Zealand Field Wprk the Middle Bronze Age. A thick layer of decayed mud brick lay above the floor. The occupation levels immediately over the floor contained a large quantity of storage-jar fragments, some of which are associated with two pits cut into the floor. Like those in the lower phase of Site 38, these may have been set into pits for stability. One of the pits contained large quantities of charcoal. A number of basalt artefacts was found including a large saddle quern, several grinding and rubbing stones, and a small basalt bowl. EXCAVATIONS AT RUKEIS Stratigraphy and Architecture Five new areas were opened up for excavation in the 1995/6 season. In 1994, Early Bronze Age (EB IB) levels were reached in a trench outside the south face of the main wall. These were apparently cut through by the foundation trench for the Middle Bronze Age fortifications. Work was continued in this area (0705) to confirm the date of the foundation cut and further to investigate the EB I levels. In addition, a slit trench was cut southwards for roughly 30 m to establish the extent of Middle and Early Bronze occupation outside the main walls (0709-13). In 1994, the main trench was laid out against the eastern inner face of the main wall revealing an upper structural phase including a network of small stone cells and a series of external silos. A soupding against the fortifications showed depth of deposit below this. In 1995/6, the sounding was enlarged and cut down to bedrock (0708). The third part of the site to be investigated this season was the north side of the upper tell. Here a trench was laid out against the inner face of the fortifications to compare the occupation sequence with that elsewhere (0707, 0714-5). In addition, clearance was undertaken in an area of massive walls just to the west (0716). 0705 The excavations showed that there are two or possibly three phases of Early Bronze I occupation above sterile soil, of which two have stone architecture. The Early Bronze Age occupation continues into the main site but was interrupted here by the construction of the Middle Bronze Age fortifications. The Middle Bronze Age occupation in this area occurs immediately on the upper Early Bronze Age layers and consists of a thick clay floor which was cut by the foundation trench for the fortifications, suggesting an initial occupation without fortifications. The foundation cut was probably taken down to sterile soil through the Early Bronze Age layers, and filled with rubble upon which the battered fortifications were built. 0708 At the base of the trench Middle Bronze Age occupation lay immediately above sterile soil. These lowest layers continued below the fortification wall. Above this lay roughly three metres of mixed ashy fill and debris abutting the inner face of the fortifications. In the upper levels, two architectural phases were identified, the top one associated with the structures excavated in 1994. The fill below these contained a substantial amount of industrial debris relating to metal working, including slag, fragments of furnace ventilation pipes, and broken clay moulds. 0707,0714-5 Early Bronze Age layers were encountered at the same absolute level as elsewhere on the site. These layers run over substantial stone debris and against a stone wall which in turn was built against a large mud-brick wall, the outer face of which was subsequently stone clad as part of the Middle Bronze Age fortifications. The mud-brick wall and its inner stone face must represent an Early Bronze Age fortification. The Middle Bronze Age occupation was built on</page><page sequence="5">Australian and New Zealand Field Work 111 a sterile deposit immediately above the Early Bronze Age layers and consisted of two rooms with stone roof supports standing to a height of approximately two metres. These rooms gradually filled with occupation debris and were then overbuilt by a second architectural phase of the Middle Bronze Age up to topsoil. This upper phase is tentatively related to the construction of the gate in 0716. 0716 Clearance of this area uncovered a large gateway. The gate was incorporated into the pre existing fortification- wall and consisted of two deep flanking chambers, probably originally containing stone roof supports of which two have survived in situ. The central passage of the gateway contained a stone-covered drain. The gate chambers underwent many structural changes including the addition of heavy internal stone pylons, the construction of guard rooms and benches. The outer doorway was constricted at one stage by the addition of stone jambs, one of which had two stone door sockets. The gate conforms to standard Middle Bronze Age architectural type. Fortifications A major clearance operation-was undertaken to remove the rubble from the upper courses of the fortification wall right round the site. It was established that with the exception of the gateway, there are no breaks in the upper courses and no external towers. Burials Four Middle Bronze Age child burials were found in the lower levels of 0714/5. These were laid in jars, three of which contained partial or complete button based juglets. POTTERY A substantial amount of pottery was recovered from excavations both at Rukeis and survey sites 38 and 42. A wide variety of Middle Bronze Age vessel forms included tall narrow necked jars, storage bowls, cooking pots, storage and fine ware jars, and bowls. Several painted sherds were also recovered. These included a fragment of 'Chocolate on White' ware and a Tell el-Yehudiyeh sherd. Pottery from the Early Bronze Age levels included a variety of hole-mouth jar forms and red burnished body sherds. The burials in the lowest Middle Bronze Age levels incorporated large jars together with small button-based juglets with double strap handles. The ceramic evidence indicates that the majority of the occupation at Rukeis dates to the earlier part of the Middle Bronze Age. The finds relate most closely to Syrian ceramic sequences of the period, with little evidence for Palestinian influence. The Early Bronze Age ceramics are more typically Palestinian, with parallels in sites in north Jordan and the Jordan Valley. Site 38 Middle Bronze Age ceramics were recovered from the trench. These included jars, several painted sherds, and a curious vessel which may be an ossuary. Site 42 Fragments of two large storage vessels were recovered from 4201. One had wavy-line incised decoration and the other had a band of incised plastic decoration on the upper shoulder of the vessel. Both are Middle Bronze Age in date. SPECIAL FINDS The excavations did not produce a great many finds. Perhaps the most significant are those relating to metal working. In 0708 levels of the main stage of Middle Bronze Age occupation</page><page sequence="6">118 Australian and New Zealand Field Work contained two moulds for casting metal objects. One was a rectangular baked clay brick with impressions on all four long faces and both ends, each for a different item. Until the mould is conserved it is difficult to establish what weapons or tools the mould was designed for. A second mould was intended for only one tool, a flat triangular object with a central protrusion. In addition to these, two fired clay pipes were found. These probably functioned as tuyeres for ventilating the furnace. Only one bronze item was found, a bracelet from 0710. Other finds included a number of clay discs of varying size and pierced with a varying number of holes. These may have been spindle whorls, loom weights, or fasteners of some kind. Two beads were also found, one of polished stone and one of glass. The glass bead came from topsoil. CHIPPED STONE A small amount of chipped stone was recovered from excavations at Rukeis. Most of this appears to relate to the Early Bronze Age levels. The raw material appears to be the fine greyish or olive coloured flint similar to that used for EB industries in Palestine and also at Jawa. The collection contains some small flake cores, small flakes, tabular scrapers, and Canaanean blades. One item of interest is a retouched flake struck from the base of a Canaanean blade core. Canaanean blade cores are extremely rare as it seems likely that the flint was traded primarily in the form of unretouched blades and flakes. Some pieces from Site 38 may indicate limited use of flint in the Middle Bronze Age. GROUND STONE Over fifty pieces of ground stone were found, all of them basalt. The majority were grinding and pounding tools. A small number of broken saddle querns were also recovered, together with some fragments of stone bowls. The rubbers, pounders, and querns are suggestive of food-processing activities, consistent with the agricultural potential of the upper wadi al Ajib. ENVIRONMENTAL DATA Bone was collected from all excavations. This will be processed as soon as a specialist can be appointed. Soil samples for flotation were taken from selected levels. The charcoals recovered will be processed as soon as is feasible. SUMMARY The excavations of the 1995/6 season have clearly established the stratigraphy and the importance of the site. Rukeis was founded in the Early Bronze Age (EB IB) as a walled settlement. This is highly significant as, although the pottery parallels are largely Palestinian, fortified sites are virtually unknown in Palestine until EB II. It seems probable that, like EB IA Jawa, the appearance of fortifications at this early stage of the EBA reflects close contacts with Syria. The Middle Bronze Age occupation is equally significant as the pottery of both major stages is closely dated within a short period of time at an early stage of MB IIA which is a key period in the history of Syria/Palestine since it reflects a time of change and transition from the small-scale economies of the late EBA to the major international developments of the MBA. Few sites of this period are known and none has the preservation and depth of stratigraphy found at Rukeis.

Excavation was concentrated on two major areas, the Acropolis Building and a block of houses and commercial complex in the Domestic Quarter. At the same time a full survey was carried out (with the aid of an electromagnetic scanner) of the very extensive necropolis which lies in the valley to the west of Jebel Khalid outside the perimeter walls. After this initial mapping in 1993 it is planned to excavate undisturbed sections of these burial grounds in future campaigns to retrieve both important information on the health and demography of the population of Jebel Khalid as well as complete assemblages of Hellenistic burial goods: it is expected that one of the rewards of this very rich site will be the establishment of chronological refinements in local and imported Hellenistic ceramics. ACROPOLIS BUILDING Previous seasons' campaigning had uncovered some 14 rooms of this major building centred around a decastyle Doric-order colonnaded courtyard (fig. 2). The strategy for the 1993 campaign was to disclose as far as possible the northern and western frontages of the building. Results of trial trenches along the northern frontage confirmed along some 25 m the whereabouts of the Ν external face of the building. This was built up from bedrock with the foundation blocks laid in quarried trenches on a bed of mortar. In the NE. corner some 2.5 m of beautifully dressed ashlar rusticated blocks, in 9 courses, lay below a hard-packed external pathway that ran around the outside perimeter of the building. The pathway was traversed in this quarter by a well constructed drain, no doubt to take run-off from the roof guttering above. The fill below this external path consisted almost exclusively of limestone chips with almost nothing in the way of artefactual material. This raised podium on which these northern rooms were constructed matches the build-up encountered on the eastern aspects of the building: it was rendered necessary as the acropolis bedrock sloped downhill away from the high ground on which the major part of the building is founded. The building's exterior at its highest on this northern front survives to 3.5 m. It is anticipated that this Ν frontage will continue (and conclude) further westwards to meet the exterior wall of the NW courtyard partially excavated in a previous season. The full dimensions of four interconnecting rooms along this Ν front were retrieved by the end of the season: they appear to have functioned basically as storerooms. On the western side of the building a further section of the colonnade was uncovered along with additional examples of guttae, cornice moulding, column fluting, lion-headed waterspout, etc. The western end of the long corridor room adjacent to the Ν colonnade was also revealed, producing to our surprise a hastily raised staircase, built of reused ashlar blocks on a rubble fill: it appears to have been thrown up to allow easy access for dismantling roofing elements as the building, after abandonment, was looted for materials. The western frontage of the house was successfully located by the end of the 1993 season. This lay at the far end of a large room, some 16 m long, which had been partly excavated in 1991. When the building had been abandoned and severely looted, secondary occupants had 4 Thanks are due to Dr Bruno Fröhlich of the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institute, Washington DC, for arranging the loan of an electromagnetic scanner (EM-31) to Dr Judith Littleton who carried out the survey.

Acropolis Building: ground plan 1993 (1:400).</page><page sequence="9">Australian and New Zealand Field Work 121 laid down a series of floors, cross-walls, thresholds and doorways inside this large room (and running right over surviving foundation-blocks beneath). Two distinct levels of secondary occupation were visible (as well as a rich rubbish pit)—but the abundant material remains recovered continued to be consistently Hellenistic. In the 1994 season work will continue along this western frontage of the building especially in a southerly direction where two trenches, unfinished in the 1993 season, have already revealed a complex of further rooms, doorways and corridors. The main objective is now to retrieve the full architectural plan of the original dwelling, a major Hellenistic building. DOMESTIC QUARTER In the Domestic Quarter (fig. 3), situated on the sloping ground which faces south across to the Acropolis, we concentrated on two areas: 1) a block of houses which is part of the £AST-WCST CIIO - )■ NOITH- SOUTH OIID Figure 3. Domestic Quarter, ground plan 1993 (1:300).</page><page sequence="10">122 Australian and New Zealand Field Work 'Hippodamian' grid layout of the private dwellings where we have located the streets on three sides (east, south, and north); 2) a little to the south of this insula and placed on the east side of the N/S road, a complex centred round a large rectangular building which is divided into two rooms, each with an impressive entrance from the east. At least in its beginnings, the complex was not a residential structure, but appears rather to have been dedicated to commercial activities. INSULA Our work in the insula took over from the 1991 campaign in the north where a section of a rock-cut basin had come to light. By the end of the present season this basin had been almost entirely cleared except for a short section of baulk in the centre of the northern end. The basin lies within an area enclosed by rubble walls at east and west, both of which fortuitously appeared in the very baulk at each side of the two original trenches. The distance from perimeter wall to perimeter wall is 10.5 m; from Ν baulk to S baulk, 8.25 m. The basin itself, from high ledge to high ledge Ε to W, is 7.75 m wide and 5.2 m from Ν to S (that is from the · high ledge at the Ν to the low ledge at the S); the S boundary of the basin lies exactly at the S baulk of the trenches, so although we fortunately gained the total dimensions, the relationship of this as yet unidentified feature to the rooms of the houses to its south is not yet determined. The floor of the basin is horizontal and level. In order to achieve this a greater depth of rock had to be cut away at the N, where it is 0.88 m deep, than at the S where it is only a few centimetres deep. On the high ledge in the NE corner of the complex (as falls within our current excavation) is a set of large blocks that appear to be steps. At the foot of these steps is a narrow channel running in an E/W direction; this channel, reasonably deep at the E, fades away towards the W. At the east side, close to the NE corner of the basin, appears to be a blocked doorway, originally an entrance to this complex. Tucked in one corner (at the NW) was an echinus bowl, but no finds of any special character hinted at the'purpose and uses of the complex, which may have been created for industrial purposes. The complex must have remained abandoned for a great period of time even during the occupation-life of the site, since at the SW corner, above an accumulated deposit of quite soft soil as high as the rock-cut ledge, was built a flimsy rubble wall which enclosed a tanoor (oven) in the narrow space between itself and the line of the complex's eastern boundary wall. At the west of the Domestic Quarter, the results of our trenches have started to put some order and definition onto the house-elements at this part of the insula. For example, what had earlier looked to be a featureless space with a skerrick of a wall across the south (bedrock lay just below the surface soil) emerged as a courtyard, which communicated with a room to its north by means of two steps leading through a doorway with gpod doorposts of large dressed stones. To the Ε of this door, within the courtyard, is a large horizontal slab, either a seat or a work-bench. Another room in this area was found to have a rubble wall arcing across one corner, and a hollowed stone in the floor for a post supporting the roof. This duplicates a similar feature found close by during the 1991 season. COMMERCIAL BUILDING/STOA COMPLEX At the Commercial Building (fig. 4), we concentrated on determining the boundaries of the complex and on following up previously observed signs of construction earlier than the main structure. This evidence was, at the E, an oven at a depth of approximately 2 m in the corner of one trench, and, at the W, a set of foundations which clearly lay beneath a badly made and roughly aligned rubble wall with its foundation course on a fill of sharp-edged field-stones (therefore a dump rather than collapsing house walls). These foundations appear also to be earlier than the main rectangle of the building. To the W no further traces of these foundations were discovered, but the W boundary of the complex emerged with (in the baulk of the</page><page sequence="11">Australian and New Zealand Field Work 123 trench) the face of a further N/S wall a little beyond it. This may be interpreted as a wall lining the N/S road which runs past the insula previously discussed. Between the road wall and the W boundary wall is a space along which a person can barely pass. The W face of the road wall emerged in a trench further N. The road wall itself is beautifully constructed of unworked stones, and the stratigraphy to the W shows a road surface of tiny broken fragments of pottery on top of a deep wind-blown and rain-washed fill. No further road surface was detected though the excavation reached bedrock in one section, at a depth of more than 2 m. Figure 4. Stoa: ground plan 1993 (1:300). At the S, we excavated two large rooms constructed in part of reused column drums. These rooms had an unusually well-made foundation at the S (part of which was uncovered in 1991 and gave the impetus for further excavation at this point). The eastern room has a roughly made rectangular oven placed more or less centrally. Both shape and location are unusual at this site; but the copious amounts of black soil (usually associated with ovens) leaves no doubt about its function. These two rooms are added against the central portion of this complex but there is no doorway in the party-wall which would permit access. Entrance to the main section of the complex is from the Ε and to the two adjoining rooms (perhaps built later) at the S where the wall, with its entrances, forms a distinct boundary which may, however, have been slightly set back—since there are remains of walls extending to the S at both the Ε and the W ends. At</page><page sequence="12">124 Australian and New Zealand Field Work the W a tanoor (oven) is neatly placed outside the room in the corner between the N/S aligned wall extension and the entrance to the room. Two further trenches at the SE of this area provided inconclusive evidence, although walls of varying quality emerged as well as a substantial trough cut out of a large slab of stone. Graeme Clarke and Peter Connor JEBEL KHALID: PRELIMINARY ARCHAEOZOOLOGY REPORT I have examined all the faunal remains from the 1993 season at Jebel Khalid together with those from the domestic quarter excavated during the 1995 season. So far, I have identified 3,394 specimens to species level. The three areas of excavation, i.e. the acropolis, the stoa, and the domestic quarter (see above, figs. 2-4) have been considered separately. I have entered all data on sheets which record for each sample the trench, locus, and level or spit, the species, the fragmentation pattern, handedness, the relative age at death, any modifications or articulations, the number of specimens, and the minimum number of individuals calculated using the maximum distribution method.5 Figures calculated so far have been based solely on NISP (number of individual specimens), MNI (minimum number of individuals), and SGE (sheep/goat equivalents—a system I have devised for determining more accurately the meat value of a given species based on current live-weights at slaughter).

All non-diagnostic material was discarded. Most equid and bird remains as well as a few specimens that could not be immediately identified have been kept separately for further identification. Dog, fox, and rat remains have been left out of the SGE calculations because they probably were not eaten. However, NISP and MNI calculations have been made for completeness. · It is noteworthy that fish, fowl, and pigs were exploited at very low levels, and deer not at all, in the domestic quarter. The bulk of the meat diet of the inhabitants was made up from cattle in the first place, then from equids (most of which were donkeys), and finally from sheep and goat. As Table 3 illustrates, cattle lose some of their prominence as a food source around the stoa. Deer become, relatively speaking, more important than in the domestic quarter and equids retain their position in the food 'hierarchy'. In gross NISP values, dogs figure highly until it is realized that 333 specimens came from one individual and may represent a burial. Birds and fish are again poorly represented. A comparison between Tables 2, 3, and 4 reveals that across the site there appears to be little variation in animal exploitation. 5 These recording sheets were developed in conjunction with Sarah Colley from the University of Sydney.</page><page sequence="13">Australian and New Zealand Field Work 125 S&amp;G Cattle C&amp;D Deer Pig Gaz.

General Conclusions 1. Butchery practices involved mainly disarticulation with very little cutting through bone or through the carcass sagitally (i.e. split in half down ä central axis). There were very few butchery marks on any bones. This seems odd in view of the fact that the technological ability to cut through bone had been known for some centuries. The answer to the conundrum may be that the majority of animals were butchered by individual families or groups rather than by specialized individuals. 2. The proportion of the meat diet that equids comprised was quite high—higher than sheep or goat on a weight basis—which seems surprising because of their value as pack animals. Both donkeys and horses (and probably mules) were utilised; however, very few were young. This indicates a dual role: as pack animals until their usefulness waned and then as food. 3. It may be a reflection of dietary preference, but even so it is astounding that a society living so close to the waters of the Euphrates chose to eat fish in such minute quantities. Perhaps excavation of the rubbish dumps, located outside the city walls and to the north of the domestic quarters (where the Greeks may have chosen to dispose of their fish remains) will eventually alter the picture. 4. A limited number of small gazelle in the area is to be expected, but the presence of mainly rusa (roe) and some cervus (red) deer in the faunal remains means that the immediate area must have had some reasonably well timbered zones in the Hellenistic period. Today trees are virtually non-existent except for some very recent plantings. Future Directions There probably are not enough faunal remains in individual rooms to carry out a room-by room analysis. However, general regional trends beyond the simple divisions indicated in this study may well be beneficial. Further divisions along the lines of primary and secondary use of the site and how dietary preferences and practices altered over time would also be valuable. The conundrums raised in the general conclusions may never be resolved. It has become S&amp;G Cattle C&amp;D Deer Pig Gaz.

L. D. Mairs ZEUGMA ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT, TURKEY, 19936 A preliminary season of field work took place in September 1993 with a team of eight plus twelve local workmen, under the direction of Philip Freeman. David Shankland, Acting Director of the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara, joined us for part of the time, as did Judith Bunbury, a geologist employed by the BIAA, and David Graf, an epigrapher from the University of Miami. The work was carried out in conjunction with and parallel to that of Rifat Erge9, Director of the Gaziantep Museum. The team was based some 8 km from Zeugma in the town of Nizip, itself an ancient settlement (believed to be the 'Nisybin in Suria' known only from a single text: CIL VI 700). Unlike Zeugma, it is today overlain by a bustling town of 60,000 and it would repay archaeologists to investigate the many locations around town currently being developed. Tombstones of the Roman period have been recorded there, and we were shown eight coins recovered as stray finds, seven of which were Hellenistic. Five trenches were opened at Zeugma, of which the two most notable were D and E, both on a bluff overlooking the Euphrates. Area D was selected when the site guard drew our attention to a robber's tunnel, inside which were revealed the massive masonry walls of a structure. Excavation was slow because there were some 3 m of accumulated soil in and over the building. Work this year uncovered an external courtyard with a deep and well-preserved cistern beneath. The cistern was fed by a series of channels and pipes which were overlain by an unexpected tesselated floor. Though there was no sign of a design in the area exposed, the pavement itself implied something of the wealth of the house to which it belonged. It had evidently been much used: nearest the cistern mouth the cubes had been worn down smoothly and there was a hint that a second pavement of tesserae had been laid on top. Behind this courtyard lay the house. Entry seems to have been through a broad entrance closed by a wooden door in two pairs of folding leaves. Fallen voussoirs suggested an arch above simple carved blocks. The large room behind was one of three opened in whole or part, all of which still retained some of their wall-plaster on which could be seen a simple design in several colours. On the first day of excavation we had exposed a small part of the floor of this major room and had been able to see that it had a pavement of white mosaic tesserae on which were traces of burnt material. Because of potential damage when excavating the inner rooms, some 30 cms of soil was left on top until the penultimate day. We expected to find a white mosaic with perhaps a simple black pattern. Instead we discovered that the black and white design was around the border only. In the centre was a beautiful panel consisting of an elaborate geometric border within which were two seated figures, all in numerous colours and executed to a high standard (pi. 13: 3). Unfortunately robbers had beaten us to it: a section of the panel had been cut out from the knees of the figures to their heads. What was left was the calves and feet, part of the background furniture, and the beginning of a word in Greek letters at the top left: ΠΑΡ [... 6 For further reports, see: D. Kennedy-P.

Elsewhere during this season, the opportunity was taken to start exploring the water supply. With no spring on the site and most of it being too high to tap river ground water by well, the principal source must have been the collection and storage of rain-water in cisterns. As in Area D, probably every house would have one beneath its courtyard. Altogether, 9 were recorded—including 5 on the very top of Belkis Tepe and one lower down which was large enough to accommodate a London bus. Area Ε was selected because of an ancient water channel visible on the surface. Opening up the area eventually revealed no less than 5 water or waste channels side by side, one still carrying a terracotta pipe in the channel bed. Water has played an important role in the life of the site in other ways. The flooding of the river and changes in its course have plainly, had an effect on the shape of the valley and of the river terraces formed over the centuries. J. Bunbury began work on a study of the geology and environment of the region and is examining some of the various marbles recorded as surface finds. Particular attention was paid to the areas of cemeteries. Hundreds of large family tombs are exposed all around, some quite elaborate. One of the largest was built to accommodate 34 bodies and still bore painted plaster on its walls. In others, the large roof tiles, with which the burial slots in the floor or in the walls had been closed, still lie scattered around. Especially interesting was the pairing of one chamber, cut into the rock of a hillside and containing 9 traditional body slots, with a second chamber without slots but bearing in relief on its walls a series of at least 6 tombstones. Altogether 22 whole or fragmentary tombstones were recorded, most still bearing some lettering. D. Kennedy D. Kennedy THE SYDNEY CYPRUS SURVEY PROJECT (SCSP): A SECOND PRELIMINARY SEASON OF INVESTIGATION, 19937 INTRODUCTION The SCSP has been working in an area measuring approximately 4 χ 14 km between the modern villages of Politiko and Mitsero, in the north-central Troodos, where Cyprus' copper ore deposits (located chiefly in the Lower Pillow Lavas) form an interface with the agricultural plain (fig. 6). We have established a systematic, stratified, intensive methodology within a fully interdisciplinary context: the project includes a geoarchaeologist, a 7 The 1993 season of the SCSP was funded entirely by grants from Macquarie University (Sydney) and 1NSTAP (Institute for Aegean Prehistory, New York).

Dating from 1973, this map is necessarily very generalized and shows only a handful of the numerous roads and tracks in the area; there is no indication of scarps and no information on land boundaries. In attempting to circumvent the problem of inadequate mapping, we looked at a number of potential sources of mapping information or survey structuring: cadastral maps, the use of a GPS (Global Positioning System), compass traverses, and pacing. Each of these sources had limitations that precluded their exclusive use for mapping and field-walking. After some experi mentation, we adopted the following procedure which we believe allows reasonably accurate positioning (±50 m) and area estimation of surveyed units, while avoiding inadvertent resurvey or skipping of terrain. First, we obtained enlargements of monochrome aerial photographs (1963 series). The scale of these enlargements is approximately 1:5,000 in the north of our area, and 1:6,500 in the south. Despite their age, these photographs proved remarkably useful. Overall the topography in our survey region is stable: with few exceptions, field boundaries and terraces have not changed, and many of the larger trees are recognizable. The only substantial changes Figure 6. 8 For a full discussion of the project's aims and methodo logy, see A. B. Knapp et al, RDAC 1992, 319-36; also id., RDAC 1994 (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="19">Australian and New Zealand Field Work 131 are village expansion and a scatter of new buildings. While there are a few new roads, most tracks remain unchanged. While it may not be possible to use old photographs in areas subject to rapid development, here we are dealing primarily with a traditional landscape in decline. Using recognizable features such as bends and junctions in roads or rivers, cleared or forested areas, and sharply defined topographic features, we transferred the UTM grid lines from the 1:50,000 map (spaced at intervals of 1 km) to each aerial photograph. Where we were able to cross-check the consistency of these lines (e.g. through their degree of convergence or their coincidence on overlapping photographs), we found-them to be quite consistent. We also ground-checked the position of the first few grid lines drawn, using a Sony Pyxis GPS. These checks were carried out by taking a GPS reading at intervals of 1 km along the grid line marked on the aerial photograph, and comparing the readings with the expected longitude values. In each case the reading was correct within the error margin of the GPS. Systematic checks were discontinued once we were satisfied that there were no problems. We are therefore reasonably confident that features can be located consistently within a 1 km grid square to within an accuracy of ±5% or 50 m on the ground, which is entirely adequate for the purpose of our survey. Having established the UTM grid on each photograph, we used a monochrome hand scanner to scan a 3" wide strip from north to south centred on each of the 1km grid lines. The resulting (TIF) files were printed out as a series of 5" long χ 3" wide sections, enlarged by a factor of 2 to a size of approximately 10" χ 6", fitting comfortably on an A4 sheet with room for marginal notes. The scale ranged from approximately 1:2,500 to 1:3,300 (3-4 mm representing 10 m on the ground). The end product served our needs well in areas of clearly marked features, such as field plots, but lacked the resolution and contrast for navigation in very eroded or uniform areas. Navigation in the field was therefore supplemented and checked by constant reference to the original 2x enlargement aerial photographs. These provecf to be ideal field documents, obviating the need to manipulate a stereoscope and stereo pairs. Annotation of surveyed units was carried out on the scanned printouts clipped beside the airphoto enlargement. RESULTS Our main goal during the 1993 season was to carry out a broad systematic coverage of the study area in order to obtain an overview of the archaeological material and exposure conditions we might expect in succeeding years. Because of the short duration of the campaign it was necessary to minimize the access time to survey plots. Consequently, rather than stratified random sampling, we adopted systematic transect sampling—with periodic use of our 'plot' strategy, namely covering individual fields that extended beyond the transects whenever 50% or more of the plot fell within the transect.9 We adopted the N/S axis of the UTM grid as our transect reference system (see fig. 7). Our survey work commenced at the east and west ends of the survey area, providing substantial samples of the Upper and Lower Pillow Lavas. We then extended the survey to transect sections in the centre of the study area to increase coverage of the Basal Group, Quaternary alluvium, and central plateau area. Our choice of transects was geared to cover a range of geological strata, environmental and erosional conditions, and topography. In the end we succeeded in covering the accessible areas within all but one transect. 9 See Knapp et al„ RDAC 1992,326 fig. 5a.</page><page sequence="20">132 Australian and New Zealand Field Work Given the intensity of survey strategy, we could not have hoped for better results, or for more extensive coverage. Our two field teams, with 4 and 5 members respectively, walked each transect or plot in parallel lines, at intervals ranging from 5 to 12.5 m, depending on the terrain. For each survey unit, we recorded a variety of factors, each divided into several features intended to be not just characteristic of our study area, but also easily discernible to fieldwalking teams: geology, topography, surface, land use, terraces (in use or abandoned, traditional or cut), aspect, slope, visibility, and background. We also made counts in each unit of the various cultural materials observed: pottery, chipped stone, slag, ores and fluxes, and tiles. Only readily diagnostic items were kept, the exception being chipped stone, which is being collected for a study of reduction sequences. All of this information was entered daily into our survey database, using Minark. During the course of a three-week period (31 May-17 June), we recorded 416 survey units covering approximately 2.6 km2. In geological terms, 130 of these units were located on the Lower Pillow Lavas (LPL), 57 on the Upper Pillow Lavas (UPL), and 111 on the sedimentary chalks, marls, or limestones. Thirty-seven units derived from Quaternary alluvium, whereas only 6 were situated in the Basal Group. In terms of topography, 142 units were on hillsides, which conveys a good sense of the most typical landscape in our survey area; 87 units were 'flat' or 'terraced', and another 53 were on fluvial terraces. In terms of surface type, 152 units were located on shallow, stony, deflated soils (very typical of the LPL), 77 on what we regarded as deep sediments, mostly ploughed, agricultural land. Twenty-one units lay in erosion gullies, whilst a further 4 units showed some surface erosion. Regarding current land use, 108 units were under cultivation of some sort, and a further 44 comprised vineyards or orchards; 107 were covered by low shrub (garrigue) or very sparse vegetation {hatha). Much smaller amounts of land were defined as pasture/grassland (21), pine forest (13), scattered pine (31), or built-up/industrial areas (4). In terms of archaeometallurgy, the statistics are impressive and revealing. Sixty-two units contained some sort of copper/iron ore, or what may have been an ore flux (e.g., manganese, hematite). Of the 89 units that contained slag, 48 are located in the igneous zone, the other 41 in the sedimentary zone (Quaternary alluvium, limestone, and chalks). In 8 units, between 50 and 100 pieces were found; a further 6 contained between 100 and 200; 2 units produced . 6 Ayios Pandeleimon Ayios loan nil Ayta Marina Lagand ■ Village ▲ Trigonometrical Point or Named Summit VMina 6 Isolated Church or Monastery /^Road f* River or Stream m Upper Plow Lava* (UPL) EJ Lower Plow Lavas (LPL) E2 Quaternary Aiuviim (QA) ■ Basal Group (BO) □ Segmentary Zone Psimolophou 3873^000 n Figure 7.

Five of the 6 units that contained more than 150 pieces were found in the sedimentary zone. A variety of taphonomic and other factors (e.g., erosion and the use of slag for road foundations) will have contributed to the wide and often dense spread of slag in the survey area. Therefore we cannot automatically assume smelting activity in every place where slag is recorded. Although our limited time schedule made it impossible to revisit these slag-yielding sites for closer inspection or resurvey, it is suggested, provisionally, that some sort of metallurgical activity occurred repeatedly in this area; it remains to be investigated in which periods and to what extent such activities took place. Certainly some sort of industrial and domestic activities characterize an area (transect 517) just south-east of the village of Klirou (see fig. 7), which shows a dense scatter not only of slag but also of post-medieval (Ottoman?) pottery. It suggests that this may be a settlement site. The entire area is extensively cultivated, and we may be able only to define the approximate limits of the scatter or concentration of cultural material. If the association between slag and pottery is not fortuitous, the history of metallurgy on Cyprus may have to be rewritten, since so far virtually no post-Roman activity has been recognized; when it has, it is thought that only copper salts and sulphates (for medical and alchemical purposes) were exploited, rather than metal.10 Two other units were more accessible than those in transect 517, and were certainly ancient settlement sites. The first site (transect 521), whose area is still undetermined, contained several ground stone artefacts; the pottery ranges in date from Iron Age to medieval (the majority). The second site (transect 519) extends over at least two hectares, and is situated on the banks of the Aloupos drainage. We revisited this site and determined its approximate extent; it has been named Aredhiou-Vouppes. The ceramics collected indicate a Late Bronze Age settlement site, with a possible Middle Bronze Age component. The pithos sherds recovered at Artdhiou-Vouppes represent several different types and sizes of storage vessels, which are thought to have been used for long-term, supra-household level storage." Lithic scatters were recorded in several survey units; in all but two cases they consisted of chipped stone without associated ground stone or Early Prehistoric (EP) ceramics. Since not a single EP sherd was recovered in any of the transects surveyed during the 1993 season, the preliminary attribution of these scatters to the EP period is based solely on generic parallels with other chipped-stone assemblages found throughout the island. The typologically undifferentiated nature of the EP chipped-stone industry in Cyprus and its reflection in the survey collection, combined with the absence of other, diagnostic artefacts, means that the material cannot, strictly speaking, be dated within the Early Prehistoric period. Two of these EP 'sites' are situated near large streams and cultivable river terraces, and are thus suitable for permanent settlement. Three further chipped-stone scatters were found on the chalk/marl/limestone interface between the region's igneous and sedimentary bedrock formations, and are almost certainly related to the acquisition and primary knapping of the Lefkara chert, an indispensable raw material whose sources are highly localized. These scatters probably represent the exploitation of local raw materials by the inhabitants of the 5th-millennium bc hilltop settlement. 10 P. Α.

From the 1993 season, at a very preliminary, immediately post-season stage of analysis (July 1993), we have thus far defined 2 chipped-stone knapping sites and what may be an EP settlement site; one definite Late Bronze settlement site covering an area of at least 2 ha; a likely Late Roman-medieval settlement; and another area with a dense concentration of slag and post-medieval pottery. The amount of slag, ores, and likely flux material recovered this season demonstrates unequivocally the existence of widespread metallurgical activity in the survey region, as expected. Reinforcinge this observation, we also recorded (in transect 519) a large slag heap, beside which lay a mine shaft with at least three large chambers leading from it. The entire area around the mine is characterized by a notable gossan (or series of gossans), which in fact drew our attention, and led to the discovery of the slag heap and mine shaft. On a return visit to the site, Stuart Swiny was able to identify a pounder with copper encrustation; such mining tools are unlikely to have been used after the Roman period. Again there was no time to examine the area in more detail, but the hillsides nearby are honeycombed with mining shafts, all of which fall in our survey area, and all of which we intend to cover in the next season. Priscilla Keswani, a member of the SCSP team, recently suggested that the regional polities of the 13th century bc in Cyprus were organized hierarchically into primary and secondary centres, comprising coastal emporia, inland centres, transshipment points, mining areas, and agricultural support villages.12 These settlements would have been linked by a complex network of tributary and exchange relations. Jenny Webb and David Frankel discuss the site of Anahondas-Palioklichia as a likely candidate for an agricultural village that may have supported the people of a mining community.13 Although such villages have heretofore been lacking in the archaeological record, from the abundance of pithos sherds at Aredhio Vouppes, we suggest that it, too, may have been such a support village. Based on the material we have recovered thus far, there is little doubt that we shall also be recording mining villages and industrial sites before the SCSP is completed. A. Bernard Knapp and Ian Johnson THE SECOND SEASON OF EXCAVATIONS AT MARKl-ALONIA, CYPRUS (1992-1993)14 From mid-November, 1992, to mid-January, 1993, David Frankel and Jenny Webb continued the Australian Cyprus Expedition excavations at the extensive Prehistoric (or Early and Middle Cypriot) Bronze Age settlement of Marki-Alonia in central Cyprus. During this second excavation season, work was concentrated on the northern area tested in 1991-2, beside the steep, high cliff where the Alykos River forms one boundary of the site. The area excavated in 1991-2 was extended to the east (fig. 8, pi. 14:1). Additional rooms, with well-preserved floors of the latest (MC I) phase of occupation, were revealed adjacent to 12 BASOR 292,1993,85-106. l3JMedA 7.1,1994,5-27. 14 The Australian Cyprus Expedition is funded by the Australian Research Council, supplemented by the Cypriot community in Melbourne, the Rotary Club of Nicosia, the Australian Society for Cypriot Archaeology, and the financial and physical contributions of the many students from La Trobe, Melbourne, Sydney, and Australian National universities who participated in the 1992/3 season.

Further to the east the site proved to be extensively damaged by ploughing, with no undisturbed occupation deposits, although remains of the footings of a substantial wall built on the bedrock were uncovered. In the main area investigated, deposits within several of the architectural units were excavated to bedrock. In most of these the latest occupation deposits were relatively intact, providing a range of complete vessels and several hobs or pot-stands similar to a fragmentary decorated example found in 1991. Some of these were portable, but others were clearly fixed in place. One was still in situ and associated with a plaster-lined hearth (pi. 14: 3). This clearly shows the form and function of these features, now confirmed as very similar to hearth-surrounds well known from the Bronze Age of Anatolia, Syria, and the Levant, and therefore of considerable importance in assessing the nature of foreign connections.

Of greater significance is the evidence for a long history of occupation and rebuilding on the site. There is good evidence of a history of architectural change in several areas. In Unit XII three superimposed wall foundations, all on the same alignment, show a sequence of renovation of the buildings in this area. In Unit XX the latest walls were built on a thick, solid foundation formed by a rubble levelling-fill. Below this was a fallen mud-brick wall from an earlier structure in the area (pi. 15:1). There is good evidence of a variety of building techniques. Large, flat, rectangular mud bricks, measuring 40 χ 60 χ 10 cm, are clearly mouldmade. Slightly smaller, but equally regular bricks, were deliberately fired hard. A variety of types of stone, including large calcarenite blocks, were used in the foundations of some of the larger and more solid walls. These blocks must have been brought to the site from at least 5 km away. In many areas</page><page sequence="25">Australian and New Zealand Field Work 137 hollows and uneven surfaces were levelled off with large quantities of stones, pottery, and animal bone, probably from an earlier rubbish dump elsewhere on the site. This indicates considerable organization and effort expended in house construction on some occasions. Much of the later form of the settlement, however, is the result of more minor rebuilding and renovation, making use of older structures and walls. The rubble foundations contained very large quantities of pottery, almost all varieties of Red Polished Ware. The latest deposits date from early in the Middle Cypriot Bronze Age (fig. 9). The bulk of the finds cover the entire span of the Early Cypriot Period, with a few sherds of Stroke Burnished Ware and Philia-type Red Polished Ware, representative of the earliest stages of the period. Several small, unfortunately broken, pottery animals and two anthropomorphic figures were found. One of the latter is almost certainly from a Red Polished plank figurine (pi. 14: 2). Other finds include copper or bronze pins and needles and a range of stone artefacts—querns, rubbers, and many less easily identifiable items. Dianne Simmons and Robyn Adams (Deakin University) continued their research on the ecology of the valley and processed soil from the site in order to identify plant remains. They have now extended the list of plants from the site: there is a wide range of species, both economic and non-economic, including wheat, barley, chickpea, lentil, grape, fig, olive, pistachio, and almond. As in the first season, all finds were processed concurrently with the excavations, with detailed documentation of all diagnostic items (about 10% of the 45,000 sherds recovered). In addition to the major excavations, a detailed study was made of the material on the surface of the Late Cypriot site at Analiondas-Palioklichia, 2 km up the Alykos Valley. This site has a great concentration of querns and grinding stones as well as fragments of large storage jars, among which one with a rare rolled impression of a hunting scene (fig. 10). This material has provided the basis for more complete assessment of the function of the site as a local storage and redistribution point within the regional economy of the period. Figure 10.

David Frankel SANTORINI PROJECT, 1993 In the second year of investigation of distal effects of the Late Bronze Age eruption of the Santorini volcano, Joe Monaghan has completed a pilot computer-model of the propagation of tsunamis generated when pyroclastic flows, whether resulting from column collapse or lateral blast or both, reached the sea. A short video film has been compiled in which the simulations are reproduced. It has emerged that, due to a combination of factors, components of the tsunamis arriving at the Bay of Mirabelo would have attained exceptional heights and impacted with a powerful whiplash effect which inflicted damage far more severe than that suffered elsewhere in northern Crete. Our decision to concentrate our initial activities on sites around the bay turns</page><page sequence="26">138 Australian and New Zealand Field Work out to have been well justified. A grant from the ARC will enable a further visit to the area in 1994 or early 1995, and either in the course of this field trip or on a subsequent one we intend, with the collaboration of the Department of Geography and Environmental Science of Monash University, to extract soil cores in the hope of detecting features which can be interpreted as due to substantial sea-flooding in the Late Bronze Age. The initial computer simulations have revealed extremely complex behaviour on the part of Santorini-derived tsunamis proceeding outwards and back-scattering among the rest of the Cyclades. A considerable amount of further, more sophisticated computer work will be required before their behaviour can be understood sufficiently well to pin-point sites and locales in which confirmation in the archaeological record and the terrain may be most profitably sought. While compelled to concede that Krakatau's supermarine pyroclastic flows from the 1883 eruption incinerated people and structures at a distance of some 45 km, many have communicated to us their doubts as to the possibility of similar flows, or components thereof, propelled from Santorini travelling as far as Crete. Such scepticism, while understandable, is not well founded. Recent field work conducted by Ray Cas in relation to a prehistoric eruption on Kos has revealed thick deposits of ignimbrites on an island 80 km from their source. The nature of the material rules out its having been ejected on ballistic trajectories, and there seems to be no alternative to the conclusion that it flowed over the sea. In the early phases of paroxysms such as those of Kos, Santorini, and Krakatau, Cas points out, the sea surrounding the volcanic island becomes densely covered with pumice. In 1883, for example, shipping lanes around Krakatau were choked with floating pumice 2 to 3 m thick and capable of supporting sailors who descended onto it from their ships. Cas goes on to suggest that such pumice provides a stable and coherent surface across which pyroclastic flows can hurtle great distances untrammelled. Peter Bicknell ISMANT EL-KHARAB (ANCIENT KELLIS) IN THE DAKHLEH OASIS, EGYPT In the first volume of this journal I reported upon the excavations conducted at Ismant el Kharab between 1986 and 1988.15 Since then three study seasons (1989-90, 1994) and three excavation seasons (1991-93) have been completed,16 the results of which are briefly reported here.17 The work has focused on two main areas of the site: the main temple complex designated Area D and the central residential quarter to its east, designated Area A. "Meditarch 1,1988,160-78. 16 The excavation seasons were funded by a major grant from the Australian Research Council awarded to the writer and Dr R. G. Jenkins (University of Melbourne). The first two study seasons' were financed by the Dakhleh Oasis Project and the last by the Egyptology Society of Victoria (Monash University) with private donations. Work at the site is made possible through a concession granted by the Egyptian Antiquities Organization to the Dakhleh Oasis Project. 1 wish to record my gratitude to the representatives of that organization for their assistance. More detailed reports have been published in the Journal of the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities 17, 1987, 157-76 and 19, 1989, 1-26, and in the Bulletin of the Australian Centre for Egyptology 1, 1990-1, 43-54; 2, 1991-2, 41-50; 3, 1992-3, 41-9 and 4, 1993-4,17-28. 17 The team, under the direction of the writer, comprised members from Edith Cowan, Macquarie, and Monash Universities, the Universities of Amsterdam, Pisa, Queensland, Toronto and Vienna, the Ashmolean Museum, the Museum of Victoria in Melbourne, and the Netherlands Institute for Archaeology and Arabic Studies in Cairo.</page><page sequence="27">Australian and New Zealand Field Work 139 EXCAVATIONS IN AREA D The Temple of Tutu At the heart of this religious and administrative complex lie the remains of the site's principal stone temple dedicated to the god Tutu (Gk. Tithoes).18 It is located within an inner mud-brick temenos and approached by a colonnaded processional route. Although it has mostly been dismantled, enough survives to determine the plan and major features of its layout (fig. 11; pi. 15: 2) and to reconstruct some of its decoration. The temple was entered through a double gateway and comprises a small open court which leads to a suite of three rooms (1-3), abutting which to the west are two further rooms (7-6) forming the contra-temple. The court contains a large, free-standing altar at its south end. The foundation for the eastern rooms of the temple consists of a sandstone platform set in compacted red clay. Decoration appears to have been restricted to the four doorways on the main axis to the sanctuary (room 1), the rear wall of the sanctuary, the entrance to tha outer room of the contra-temple (room 7), and the lintel of the northernmost of the two entrances in the main gateway. Only one of the decorated blocks preserves a legible cartouche and this provides the name of the emperor Pertinax (1 January-28 March, 193). This probably comes from the contra temple; its roughly executed, sunken relief resembles that 'of the lintel from the northern entrance in the gateway (pi. 16:1). It is probable, however, that the decoration (and building) of the main entrance and the temple proper can be ascribed to the late first or early 2nd centuries at the latest.19 Amongst rubble associated with the laying of the foundation platform were architectural fragments from a religious structure. These, together with reused blocks in the south wall of the temple and other isolated blocks, provide evidence for an earlier temple at the site. Later additions and alterations to the temple comprise a series of small, mud-brick chambers erected to its south, the bricking up of the stone altar at the south of the open court, and the cutting of a large niche in the fa9ade south of the gateway. Most impressive of all was the erection of a portico in front of the temple. This comprised four plastered, baked-brick columns set on rectangular bases spanning the width of the processional approach. On the east side of these columns sandstone pedestals (for statues?) were set up; two of these preserve dedicatory inscriptions in Greek which can be dated to the 3rd century. Coins found in the floors of the small chambers are pre-reform issues of Diocletian. The excavations have produced a wide variety of objects, including fragments from cult statues in stone and plaster, decorative elements from wooden naiskoi, stone pedestals for these shrines, votive objects, including a fine painting of Isis upon a wooden board, and plaster sculpture. The latter varies in size from miniature to life size, and appears to have been attached to the temple walls. Busts of Isis predominate; stone fragments prove the existence of at least one life-size statue of this goddess and also of Serapis. Clearly, as might have been expected, the cults of these two deities were practised here. The temple has also yielded papyri inscribed in Greek and Demotic, unfortunately all in a very fragmentary state. However, the Greek fragments preserve several dates, including the earliest dated papyrus known from the site so far, that of AD 202/3; the latest from the temple area is 377. The texts in Demotic may predate those in Greek. Paganism definitely survived at the site until 337, when a priest of Tutu was still active. Certainly before the site was 18 On this god see, most recently, O. E. Kaper, 'The god Tutu (Tithoes) and his temple in the Dakhleh Oasis', Bulletin of the Australian Centre for Egyptology 2,1991-2,59-67. 19 A dedicatory inscription found at the site dates to the reign of Antoninus Pius, see G. Wagner, BIFAO 73,1973,177—80; coins of this niler and of Hadrian have also been found, see G. E. Bowen in: C. A. Hope et al., Journal of the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities 19,1989,16-20.</page><page sequence="28">140 Australian and New Zealand Field Work Fig. 11. Plan of the inner temple temenos at Ismant el-Kharab showing the Main Temple and Shrine I to its south.</page><page sequence="29">Australian and New Zealand Field Work 141 abandoned at the end of the 4th century the temple had accumulated material of a domestic nature, including a hearth in the open court, and rubbish had been dumped in several of the subsidiary chambers. Amongst the latter are mid- to late 4th century coins. Shrine I Shrine I is the largest of four mud-brick structures also within the inner temenos. It lies adjacent to the Main Temple on its south and comprises two rectangular rooms which together are longer than the temple. Its entrance formed part of the temple fa£ade, and so Shrine I can be assumed to be part of the original architectural complex. Only the western end of the inner room, the sanctuary, has been excavated. This room was originally barrel-vaulted and decorated with paintings in secco technique over all wall and vault surfaces (pi. 17: 1). The walls support classical panel decoration within which are birds and radiating floral sprays; the panels are separated by a vine motif. Above this are four registers of pharaonic cult reliefs extending to the upper part of the vault, down the centre of which were various classical motifs. One of these, above the entrance into the shrine from the north, contained a female bust—possibly representing Isis, fate, or a local patron. Analysis of the pharaonic paintings shows that the decoration in the northern half focuses upon Neith accompanied by Tapshay/Tnephersais (only known from this site), while in the southern half Tutu dominates. Amongst the other deities represented are the principal gods of Dakhleh Oasis and othei»s from Dush in the nearby Kharga Oasis. The quality of the workmanship evident in these paintings and the accuracy of their iconography makes a date in the 1 st or early 2nd centuries probable. Before the abandonment of the site this structure also witnessed reuse. Its floors are covered with a compacted layer of animal droppings, there is domestic garbage, and the walls have several graffiti. One of these is in Coptic, written by George and Kiris after spending the night in the shrine with their geese! The lower registers of pharaonic decoration attest to the all too common practice of defacing decoration in pagan religious monuments, though whether this was done by Christians is a moot point. The West Tombs Within a mud-brick enclosure which forms the north-west corner of Area D stand the remains of two elaborate mausolea (pi. 17: 2). Their architecture seems to have been similar. Each comprised a rectangular platform, approached via a flight of stone steps, which supported a single chamber framed by a row of columns. A subterranean burial chamber is situated below. It has a barrel vault over its stone walls and is reached through a vertical shaft opening in the south-east corner of the upper room. Little of the superstructures other than the platform, the steps, and sections of columns and capitals survives. They were constructed in a mixture of sandstone and baked brick. Tomb 1 on the south is the better preserved. The burial chamber contained the interments of eleven persons, including adults, juveniles and infants, wrapped in linen. In several cases there is evidence that the bodies were packed with sand, indicating that some form of mummification had possibly been practised. Grave-goods included pottery, glass, a basket, a pair of lead sandals for a child, numerous bouquets of myrtle and rosemary, and six gold rings. The board upon which the bodies were lowered into the tomb and part of the pulley device used in that process were also found. Tomb 2 had been completely looted and only a few bones remained. The details of the architecture set these tombs apart from all others in the Dakhleh and Kharga Oases and recall the so-called 'Temple Tombs' of Ghirza in Libya. These may date to</page><page sequence="30">142 Australian and New Zealand Field Work the 2nd century.20 The ceramics from Tomb 1 certainly predate the 4th century, but are unlikely to be of the 2nd century. One of the gold rings has a carnelian gem engraved with the head of a Roman woman. The stone is possibly to be dated to the early 2nd century, but it is mounted in a later setting. Another ring bears a gem engraved with the image of a male figure stooping over what may be a cross. The West Church Complex Immediately to the west of the West Tombs and separated from them by a narrow lane, is the West Church (pi. 17: 3). This mud-brick structure possesses two rooms of equal size. The nave has a single apse, flanked by two small rooms, an altar in front of the apse, and benches around the walls; the narthex is also furnished with benches. The church is accessible only from a room to the south of the narthex, off which opens a flight of stairs leading to an upper storey. This room also provides access to a complex of rooms to the east, adjacent to the nave. This outer room preserved the remains of a hearth and numerous impressions from ceramic jars and basins in its floor, and its walls are lined with benches, all suggestive of an official meeting area where food might be provided. The inner rooms resemble domestic quarters where travellers could spend the night. The comparative dearth of artefacts from these rooms does not speak for their use as a domicile. The church and this adjoining complex were constructed as one architectural unit. Dating evidence for the use of the complex is derived principally from numismatics. Forty three coins have been found, 39 coming from the south complex of rooms where they were found embedded in the earth floors. Of these only 14 have yielded positive identification, ranging in date from Constans to Valentinian II (333-392). EXCAVATIONS IN AREA A House 3 House 3 is the easternmost of three houses which form a block on the northern edge of the central residential area of the site. An entrance corridor provides access to a central room off which open eight other rooms; the corridor also leads to a courtyard containing animal mangers, storage and cooking facilities. The house is preserved to almost 3 m in height. Its architectural features closely resemble those of the other house in the block. The entrance system and the animal mangers display various changes in plan indicating a longer period of occupancy than was previously thought for these houses. Excavation to bedrock at several points within the house have shown it to overlie dumps of domestic refuse, predominantly pottery, which can be ascribed to the 2nd or 3rd centuries. Finds in this house were made in abundance; those found at or near floor level are of particular significance (pi. 16: 2). Over 150 pottery vessels have been reconstructed from the material in the central living room alone. It appears that the goods assembled in this room were intended for removal when the site was being abandoned. There are extensive collections of basketry, glass, faience, wooden objects and coins (206); two intact wooden books were found, 44 inscribed wooden boards and some 3,000 fragments of inscribed papyrus. Dated texts in Greek cover a period ranging from the late 3rd century to 390, which is the latest definite date recorded amongst the texts from the site. The coins attest the same date range, being from Numerian to Valentinian II (283-392). The languages attested by the documents are Coptic, Greek, Latin, and Syriac. The Greek texts are extremely varied in content, including official administrative and legal documents, 20 See Β. Jones-G. Barker, LibSt 1979-80,30.</page><page sequence="31">Australian and New Zealand Field Work 143 economic transactions, private letters, amulets, and magical papyri. There is even a deed of transfer of ownership of part of the house complex to one of its residents and part-owner from a neighbour resident in House 2. The Coptic material, while including several economic texts, is dominated by private letters and religious documents. Its quantity in relation to Greek is significant, occurring in the ratio 2:3, thus attesting a far more extensive use during the 4th century than might have been envisaged. The private letters comprise one of the largest well provenanced and dated collections known from the period. The religious material and some of the letters have revealed the existence of a flourishing Manichaean community. The former include extracts of Mani's canonical works, psalms and devotional texts, doctrinal texts, amulets and a page from a codex with part of Paul's Epistle to the Romans. Two bilingual Coptic-Syriac glossaries occur; there also are several Manichaean texts written in Greek. These discoveries enable us to study a Manichaean community within its physical, economic, and cultural context. House 4 This house is situated due east of the main entrance into the outer temenos of the Temple of Tutu. It was selected for excavation in the hope that it would provide information about domestic activity at the site before the 4th century, as it was assumed that no such prime spot would have been left vacant until that time. To date, however, every indication is that the house was occupied during the late 3rd and 4th centuries only. If this proves to be the case then the urban development of the central part of the site would appear to be entirely a feature of the last century of occupation. The exact details of the house are, as yet, uncertain, as only a small part has been excavated. It is preserved to first-floor level, with many of the roofs of the ground level rooms surviving. It appears to have at least 20 contiguous rooms, including three staircases, but it is unknown whether these form one residential unit or several. Six rooms at the north end of the structure were examined (pi. 17: 4). These yielded well-preserved floor deposits and superimposed floors; excavation below the floors of one ground-level room yielded a fill of tightly packed potsherds in ash. This ceramic material is of the same kind as that from below House 3 and can be ascribed to the 2nd-3rd centuries. Almost at surface level was a deposit of extremely fine glassware, adding to the evidence that glass was manufactured at the site. In general, ceramics and other finds resemble those from House 3. On the other hand, House 4 has yielded fragments of a faience amphora of a type usually ascribed to the 1st or early 2nd centuries. This was evidently an heirloom. Textual material was again found in abundance: there are 41 inscribed boards and approximately 600 fragments of inscribed papyrus. Unlike those from House 3, these texts are mainly written in Greek. One document has yielded a date of 368; 126 coins have been found, ranging in date from Diocletian to Valens (284-378). Colin A.
