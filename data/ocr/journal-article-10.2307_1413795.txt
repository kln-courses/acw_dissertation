Each new topic which he selects for investigation is handled with a confidence which suggests not the speculative agility of the professional philoso- pher-though Janet's powers of synthesis are by no means con- temptible-but the tested knowledge of the experimental scientist and the ripe experience of the clinical specialist; for his hypotheses in all branches of psychology and philosophy are suggested and tested by his observations of psychopathic patients 16</page><page sequence="2">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 17 at the Salp&amp;triere-observations made with an exactitude and re- ported with a clarity and suggestiveness which we have often had cause to admire. When such a man turns his attention for the first time1 to the psychology of religion, it is time for all interested parties to take notice; for something fresh and stimulating is to be ex- pected from him. Such at least seemed to be the feeling of the lecture-going public at Paris; for which Janet announced, for the winter of I92I-22, a course on the "Evolution of Moral and Religious Conduct", they crammed his dingy lecture-room to its capacity at the first session, and all the winter long they cheer- fully endured the discomforts of backless benches and bad ventilation without once flagging in their interest. The popular- ity of the course was due in some measure, to be sure, to the scintillations of Janet's Voltairean wit-which no dull repro- duction could ever hope to preserve undimmed-but chiefly, I believe, to the intrinsic importance of the subject and the originality of the views presented. I am confident that I was not the only foreign auditor who felt that these lectures alone had repaid him for his trip to France. These are my reasons for hoping that an account of these lectures,2 with a few notes and comments, will be welcome to American students of the psychology and philosophy of religion. It is to be hoped that the substance of the course will eventually 1Directly, that is. The student of the psychology of religion will find studies of ecstatics, religious paranoiacs, etc., scattered all through Janet's writings.

Janet began with a few comments on the title of the course. (i) "CONDUCT" (literally conduites, in the plural. It would be con- venient if we could also use the plural, and speak of "conducts" or "be- haviors" as we speak of "actions"). The use of this word implies the "external" point of view in psychology, according to which psychology is "the science of the external reactions between the organism and the environment."4 Ever since Descartes set the internal phenomena of consciousness in the foreground of philosophy, psychology has-until very recently- followed in his train. If his subjectivistic lead be advantageous from the philosophical point of view-which may be doubted-it has at any rate proved "deplorable" from the scientific. To conceive that consciousness is the fundamental thing, and action the secondary, is totally to miscon- ceive the situation. In order of time, action precedes thought, desire is only an abridged action, and external discussion between man and man is more primitive than that internal discussion which constitutes thought. (2) "EVOLUTION". This is purely a methodological term. To speak of the "evolution" of moral and religious conduct, and to divide the pro- cess into higher and lower stages, is not to say that history presents any such continuous progression from lower to higher. We merely assert that, for purposes of study, the most useful order is that of increasing complexity and increasing perfection. Nevertheless, if we analyze conduct into its simpler and its more com- plex forms, we shall discover that the simpler types are common to the infant, the savage, and the mental defective, while the more complex types are peculiar to civilized man in his normal mental state; so that our order of evolution is not merely arbitrary. For the reconstruction of the earlier levels of conduct we are not solely dependent on anthropology, for we can study those identical levels of conduct in the child and in the mentally subnormal individual. Mental diseases are nothing more nor less than the disappearance of certain higher, more complex levels of conduct, and the exaggeration of certain lower, simpler types. Anthropology, child psy- chology, and psychiatry confirm one another. But what are these levels through which conduct must climb in the course of its evolution? Janet assumed that his auditors were familiar with his "hierarchy of mental tendencies," and so contented himself with outlining it upon the blackboard. I give herewith a somewhat fuller out- line, based upon the important lectures which Janet had recently given at the University of London, entitled La tension psychologique, ses degres, ses oscillations. These lectures, published in the British Journal of Psychology, Medical Section, 2, I920-2I, I ff., I44 ff. and 209 ff., form the best possible introduction to Janet. aJanet tells me that he may perhaps give a place to these lectures, in substance, in a book he hopes to write on the "Psychology of Behavior" (Psychologie de la conduite). 4Janet's point de vue externe seems to be identical with what we call the "behavioristic" point of view. American behaviorists apparently are not aware of the close parallel which exists between his form of anti-intro- spectionism and their own. In a recent lecture at Teachers College, Wat- son made the statement that the behavioristic method had never yet been applied in the field of abnormal psychology. Either I am wrong in classify- ing Janet as a behaviorist, or Watson was mistaken. i8</page><page sequence="4">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 19 I. Reflex level: explosive reaction, in which discharge takes place all at once. 2. Perceptive or suspensive level: retarded discharge. 3. Social or socio-personal level: common to the higher animals, pri- mitive man, and idiots;6 conduct with reference to other members of the same species; distinction of Self from Other. "The individual no longer reacts merely to the stimuli which come from the external world, he reacts to his own reactions" (Brit. Journ. Psych., loc. cit., 147). 4. Level of elementary intelligence: imbeciles; "combination of two per- ceptive conduites into a single synthetic act" due to the necessity of adding something to one's acts "to make them social, to render them intelligible to others" (ibid., I49). These socially intelligible acts are the beginning of language, and mark the transition to the human stage, for man is an "animal bavard". All succeeding levels are characterized by "the establishment of more and more complicated relations between speech and language" (ibid., I51). 5. Assertive level (niveau asseritive ou pithiatique): level of le debile mental; roughly equivalent to L6vy-Bruhl's "pre-logical" stage. "The assertive tendencies", says Janet in an explanatory note to me, "are characterized by the application of language to conduct, by the active union between language and the movement of the body (membres) which constitutes the essential part of primitive will and belief." At this stage, desires are inseparable from beliefs; beliefs are not inhibited by the con- sciousness of inconsistency between speech and action. 6. Reflective level: l'6goiste passione; beginnings of internal conversation or thought, which "reproduces within ourselves the discussion of an as- semblage, and which does not permit the giving of assent until after an inward discussion" (ibid., I55). 7. Ergetic or rational level: the system-builder; beginnings of self-imposed discipline of the will and the thinking-process (work, ascetic morality, and logic); appearance of systems of philosophy judged by the test of inward consistency. 8. Experimental level: the scientist; subjection of human desire and human logic to further discipline through application of the test of con- formity to external nature.6 9. Progressive level: the genius; appearance of the idea of progress and the conscious quest of progress; a stage still lying far above the average level of human intelligence. Conduct at these higher levels is more difficult than conduct at the lower levels, in that it is more efficient (adapted to its specific end), more complex (hence more acutely conscious), and more elaborately systematized into long unified sequences of acts. It requires higher mental tension to bring it to successful completion, and a single act consumes more mental energy or force than a multitude of lower-level, lower-tension acts,-as may be seen in cases of "derivation," when the patient performs a multitude of low-tension acts in place of a single high-tension act from which he shrinks (ibid., Lecture I, La force et la tension psychologiques). The questions to consider in attempting to describe the "evolution" of moral and religious conduct are therefore the following. I. At what level does the type of conduct with which we are concerned first appear? 2. What characteristic forms does it assume at each successive level thereafter? Does it tend to persist or does it tend to become so radically transformed that it may be said to disappear? SFor parallel between levels of mental evolution and the well-known levels of mental degeneracy, see B. J. Ps., loc. cit., 209. 6Cf. levels 6, 7, and 8 of Janet's hierarchy with Comte's "theological," metaphysical" and "positive" stages.</page><page sequence="5">Janet paused to remark that generalizations about "man" and his moral and religious nature are foolish; it is necessary to specify what grade of man is to be studied. Most differences of opinion about the nature of morals and religion arise, he said, from the fact that different levels of conduct are studied by different investigators. For example, the wide variations between Durkheim's and Leuba's7 descriptions of religion arise from the fact that Durkheim studies conduct at the social, elementary intellectual, and assertive levels, where the rite and the myth are in the foreground, while Leuba studies it at the reflective level, where the divinity first enters upon the scene. I. PRELIMINARY DESCRIPTION OF MORAL-RELIGIOUS CONDUCT Acknowledging the difficulty of framing a definition of moral or religious conduct which will apply at all levels of conduct, we must nevertheless describe their nature in a general way at the very start, if we are to recognize them when they appear in the course of mental evolution. In this preliminary description, we need not distinguish sharply between moral conduct and religious conduct, for it is only late in the history of mental development that they become differentiated. What, then, is the distinctive function of moral-religious conduct, which distinguishes it from all other types of conduct, at all the levels of conduct? The answer is, in a word, the func- tion of government, organization, control. Other types of con- duct are defined by their content, their object, their specific goal; but moral conduct mingles with all conduct, and controls the budget of all the mental forces.8 To speak of a "budget" of mental forces is not to use purely fanciful language. The control of household and national finances is only a special form of a far more general type of conduct. Wherever you have expenses and receipts you have a budget; wherever you have the attempt to keep the sum of the expenses below the sum of the receipts, you have economy; and the instinct of economy is one of the most elementary racial instincts, and the root of all morality. The economy of one's financial resources is a secondary moral task; the economy of one's mental resources is the primary moral task. In describing the moral task we may therefore most aptly use financial metaphors. (I) Mental expenses. These create the moral problem. That they exist is evident, for they sometimes lead to mental bankruptcy, and frequently lead to various degrees of mental poverty-which is an accurate appellation for mental disease. Fatigue is "the suspension of action in prevision of future bankruptcy," yielding to fatigue is the beginning of all morality. If we study the mentally bankrupt or poverty-stricken-the war has left plenty of them in our midst-we may easily perceive what types of action are ruinous or expensive. For one thing, the cranking-up (mise en train) of any action is very expensive. The mentally bankrupt can often continue an action they are incapable of beginning. Again, the effort to surmount 7Janet considers Durkheim and Leuba the two greatest figures in the field of the psychology of religion. 8Cf. this definition of moral conduct in general with Coe's definition of religion as an organizing tendency immanent in all the mental functions. Religion and morals often coalesce in Coe's psychology, as they always do in Ames'. HORTON 20</page><page sequence="6">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 2I obstacles that unexpectedly appear in the midst of an action is of course costly; the weak shrink from it. To end an action costs almost as much as to begin it; many mentally diseased people cannot stop doing what they once have begun to do. Finally, decisions or conflicts of duty take great strength; the diseased always try to get others to decide for them. What is this "force" that is expended in action, and whose exhaustion means mental bankruptcy? Janet has an aversion for metaphysics, and does not define it; but he is convinced that it is as real and objective as electricity. If we study it long enough, he says, we may come to measure its volts and amperes. Subjectively, its expenditure is accompanied by certain emotions; sadness, fear of action, etc., are the characteristic emotional signs of its exhaustion; but our method leads us to look at it rather from the objective, realistic standpoint. (2) Mental receipts. The ultimate sources of mental energy seem to be physiological: the functioning of the alimentary and respiratory organs, the impact of light upon the body, the influence of electrical currents, etc., etc. Such receipts are taking place all the time, but the balance between receipts and expenditures is always unfavorable except during sleep. Sleep is the great renewer of energy, not because the receipts are then greater- as a matter of fact, they are less-but because expenses are temporarily reduced almost to nothing. Men's psychological incomes are very different. Here above all the native inequality of men becomes evident. Each man's income is like a fixed salary, hardly varying from day to day. To be sure, the rich man's salary often seems variable; he accomplishes marvels of industry sometimes and little or nothing at other times; but this apparent fluctuation of energy is due to the fact that he never spends his whole income. His wealth is so great that neither moderate nor extravagant spending makes any appreci- able dent in his pocket-book. He could always do more if he would. But examine the poverty-stricken neurasthenic, and you will see at once how rigidly fixed is his income. He can always accomplish exactly the same amount of work before collapsing; and if he is wise, he will not attempt to compete with men of larger income. However, there are certain emergencies when not even the richest daily income is capable of covering the expense-times of danger, when one's own life or that of dear ones is threatened, times when fortune, honor, or native land is at stake. At such times, as James points out in "The Energies of Men," one suddenly discovers that reserves of energy lie at hand such as one hardly dreamed of possessing, and things are ac- complished that in ordinary times are impossible. Not only do the actions multiply in speed and vigor, but the emotions run up into the heights of joy and exultation, and the whole world takes on a brighter hue. Sometimes illumination or photism is actually experienced. Joy and illumination are the infallible subjective signs of extravagant mental expenditure; one has the sensations of the man who has "money to burn" and flings it recklessly right and left, regardless of the outcome. Whence come these unsuspected reserves of mental energy? Well, all instincts, tendencies, and habits carry with them a store of force sufficient to procure their own realization. They have a charge attached to them, as it were. Whatever stimulates the tendency releases the force. Instincts or primitive tendencies carry especially heavy charges. McDougall indeed considers that power belongs only to two or three primitive tendencies- life, maternity, power-and that all others derive their power from these; but Janet, after weighing the issue in the controversy between McDougall and other American psychologists,9 is inclined to agree with McDougall's 9Janet mentioned Hocking as the chief opponent of this view of McDougall's. I should think that Woodworth's "Dynamic Psychology" contained the best critique of McDougall and the best statement of the contrary position.</page><page sequence="7">HORTON opponents: that there is no tendency or habit which has not some motor charge attached to it. All stimuli call out reserve energies; but it is only when we are stirred to the depths of our primeval instincts that great explosions of energy occur. But it is foolish to suppose that we can draw on our reserves forever, or that our reserves are unlimited. Experience shows that reaction, de- pression, and sometimes ruin follow every such triumphant meeting of an emergency. The whole world is now running along on a low level of mental energy on account of having drawn too heavily on its reserves during the war. Occasionally a sudden drawing on his reserves may make a man's fortune; the result may be the more active functioning of all the functions that tend to fill up the reserves again; and the man goes along thereafter, temporarily or permanently, on a higher level than before, But persistent drawing on the reserves, such as that practised by the alcoholist, is always bad. We may sum up Janet's description of moral conduct thus: its function is the control of all other functions, for the conser- vation of mental energy. It is a dynamic type of conduct, and unless we take the dynamic point of view we shall miss it alto- gether. From a purely material point of view, says Janet, there are only four types of conduct: rapprochement, attrac- tion, consumption, and excretion. Moral conduct is none of these, but mingles with them all. II. ORIGIN OF MORAL-RELIGIOUS CONDUCT AT THE SOCIAL LEVEL Durkheim has insisted-and many another has taken up the cry-that religion is a social phenomenon. Janet admits the truth of the remark, but fails to see any startling significance in it. To be sure, there is a social element in all moral and re- ligious conduct-society and the chief, for example, stand in a very close relationship with duty and deity, respectively,-but all phenomena on higher psychological levels have arrived there by a process of evolution, and certain distantly corresponding phenomena can be observed on all the other levels, even the lowest. In this case, we might just as well say that moral and religious conduct evolved from reflex conduct as from social conduct; for even at the reflex level we find inhibition resulting from an eternal conflict between two reflexes, and inhibition is the prototype of moral control. All higher types of conduct are based on lower types, and so it means little to say that a given type of conduct evolved from social conduct. Janet agrees that moral-religious conduct first assumed its charac- teristic form at the social level; but the real question remains unanswered: what aspect of social conduct gave rise to moral- religious conduct? One answer to this question has very commonly been put forward. Morality, we are told, originated in the parental instinct, which inspired respect for life, leading to mutual aid, collaboration and devotion. Love 22</page><page sequence="8">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION is the basis of morality. From this point of view, remarked Janet, the ideal frontispiece for a text-book of ethics would be a picture of a cat suckling and licking her kittens. The difficulty of this view is that morality thus defined must be sought far down the scale of evolution; if maternity is morality, physiology be- comes moral. Nay more, men are much less moral than animals according to this standard. Primitive morality and religion are much less reasonable and logical than the conduct of the mother cat. The instinctive conduct of the animal tends in large measure to be useful to him and his mates; but three-fourths of the rites and customs of primitive man are cruel and dangerous as well as absurd. There is hardly a crime or an obscenity that has not been consecrated by custom and religion. From the rational- ethical point of view we have degradation, not evolution, in passing from the highest brutes to the lowest men. It is only later that reason, utility, and love begin to criticize custom and religion. "Only decrepit religions become reasonable." The Mosaic code was not a "disguised hygiene;" hygienic considerations were absolutely foreign to its authors. It is useless to look for the operations of any such motives at the start. No, the type of social conduct from which morality and religion sprang was something quite different: imitation. Here was a clue which Durkheim ought not to have neglected, for he had the studies of Tarde before him; but in his anxiety to separate sociology from psychology he broke the link between the individual and social mind, and so made it impossible for him- self thoroughly to explain religion or any other social phenomenon. How does imitative conduct serve the end of mental economy? This it must do, according to our definition, if it is to qualify as even rudimentary moral-religious conduct; and this it does, as Janet at once proceeded to show. Imitation is nothing more nor less than action induced by the sight of similar action. Now sight, of all the senses, is the most social; it puts all bodies, one's own and one's neighbor's alike, on the same plane; hence to see another acting is to see oneself apparently acting, at least for primitive minds. If all perceptions involve incipient actions, much more is this true in this case. The savage-and indeed many higher animals, for the social level is reached before man appears-cannot see action without almost mechanically reproducing it.1? Such externally induced conduct demands no effort at all, and so is enormously less expensive than the trial-and- error conduct which furnished the pattern and stimulus. Sheep and idiots incapable of taking a step alone can walk in a row with ease. But how about the bell-sheep? If imitative conduct is economical and hence moral for the group, how is it with the leader? Are not most extra- ordinary exertions required of him? They are, indeed, at the start. Not only initiative and choice (however haphazard), but also preparation for choice (alertness and watchfulness), are very expensive and often draw deeply upon the psychological reserves of the leader. But after the first step his investment begins to pay him compound interest, for he sees his action reproduced all about him, and a hundred identical visual images mechanically stimulate his muscles to continue in the given direction. The extra force he had mobilized for his heroic effort proves in part unnecessary and diffusing itself through his body appears subjectively as a feeling of satisfaction and joy. Imitation is cheap but not joyous; initiative is costly but joyous, and the expended energy is more than repaid. Hence the leader's lot is enviable in spite of its initial irksomeness, and the desire to be imitated early becomes a spur to conduct. 1?It is not strictly true, of course, remarked Janet, that imitation is "mechanical." Only such action can be thus induced as the organism is already predisposed to. But the organism is predisposed to all acts capable of performance by another member of the species. 23</page><page sequence="9">Imitation, then, is an energy-conserving conduct both for the leader and for his imitators, and as such it makes for the strength of the group, and survives and grows as a type of conduct. Here we have the real origin of moral-religious conduct. III. MORAL-RELIGIOUS CONDUCT AT THE LEVEL OF FLFJEMEFN- TARY INTELLIGENCE: ORDER AND COMMAND Imitative conduct at the start springs up quite spontaneously and unconsciously. Someone takes the initiative because he happens to be the most energetic; the others imitate him almost automatically. But a higher stage of moral evolution sets in when leading and following become sharply specialized func- tions: when the leader insists on being imitated, and the followers may be said to understand and obey, and not merely to imitate him. Here conduct is complicated by the appearance of lan- guage; we are at what Janet terms the "level of elementary intelli- gence." Order and command are the characteristic phenomena at this level; they begin at the previous level among the animals, but their full evolution is impossible until the level of elementary human intelligence is reached. It is not hard to see how this evolution occurs. Leadership is, as has been said, a pleasant and emotionally profitable experience, in spite of its costliness; hence the leader tends not only to continue to perform his func- tion, but to extend it in such a way as to increase his profits from it, both by increasing his earnings and by decreasing his expenses. In the first place, he increases his earnings (in the shape of satisfaction at seeing himself imitated) by facilitating imitation, that it may spread as far as possible. He takes his position at the head of the group, where he is visible to all, and performs the action to be imitated as vigorously as possible-at least at the start-accompanying it with loud cries to attract attention. But in the second place, he soon discovers that he can save much expenditure of energy, and so increase his margin of profit, by ceasing to perform the given action as soon as the others are well started. Eventually, with the advent of language, the stage is reached when the leader omits the action altogether, and only the accompanying cry-"Fight March I"-remains. This lighten- ing of the leader's functions leaves him free to observe the conduct of his followers. Quick, perfect imitation gives him the most pleasure; hence he tends to demand it with insistence repaying it with marks of favor and punishing the delinquent. Watch a herd of wild cattle and see how harassed the leader gets at each failure of the herd to respond instantly to his com- mands. First he renews the action to be imitated more energetically than before, with even louder bellowings. This failing, he begins to snort with anger, and to make threatening motions toward the delinquents. Finally he comes over and prods them with his horns. Thus, by the motives of love of approbation and fear of disapprobation and punishment, the actions of the herd tend to be stimulated, lengthened out, and elaborated, while the actions of the leader are undergoing the opposite process of shortening and simplification. He takes special charge of the beginning of the action; they take charge of the end of it, under his direction. Finally comes the stage when he speaks and they act. The earlier part of this evolution is illustrated by the conduct of a pack of hounds. Both the leader and his imitators both bark and run. Such conduct lies on the "social" level. The stage at which the leader barks and the rest run, so to speak, lies on the level of elementary intelligence. It is HORTON 24</page><page sequence="10">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 25 never reached by animals; it is the stage represented by primitive man. Voiced command and obedience thereto, the desire to lead balanced and fostered by the desire to be led,1' are the most characteristic phenomena of primitive society; and it was out of this situation that there sprang the grotesque codes of custom that are the historical basis of all our morality. The energy-conserving capacities of this type of conduct hardly need any further illustration. Janet pointed out that two-thirds of the com- monly recognized types of mental diseases lie on the level of elementary intelligence, and might be classified as "authoritarian maladies,"'2 involving a mania for command or for obedience. Since the victims of all these diseases are mentally impoverished, they are not capable of real initiative, choice and command; they seek to get the rewards of leadership without its expenses by issuing all sorts of commands, hapazard, and they punish the delinquents not by an expensive exhibition of anger but by piteously ex- hibiting their suffering at not being obeyed. Another frequent type of authoritarian is the "non-commissioned officer," who gets his orders from higher up and so is saved the pains of choice and foresight, but repeats them with fierce vehemence and gets all the satisfaction of seeing them executed before his eyes. Authoritarians, then, are those who have a mania for commanding what does not need to be commanded or has already been commanded. Such cases testify to the rewarding nature of the commander's type of conduct; but there are other cases which testify to the even more economical and satisfying nature of obedience as a type of conduct. There are people who passionately abase themselves before some chosen com- mander and expend themselves in his service in a sort of delirium of gener- osity and self-sacrifice,-if only he will tell them just what to do at every step. Thus command and obedience, in the case of primitive man, naturally turned out to the profit of all. To the chief, the obedience of the others gave a delightful sense of security, unknown to the others. He need fear no competitor, for he stands above all competition and regulates it; he does not dread famine like the rest, for he knows that if only a mouthful is left in the tribe it is his; he does not greatly fear the enemies of the tribe, for he has hundreds of men ready to spring to his defence whenever he says the word. And so the future looks serene to him; but it also looks serene to the others, for they know that, whatever happens, they will always be told what to do, and so do not need to worry themselves over conflicting alter- natives. Arbitrary and foolish as were many of the commands issued by the chief-and the customs and laws based thereon-it was better to sub- mit to them than to have no chief. IV. THE ASSERTIVE LEVEL: RITES AND MYTHS: PRE-RELIGION With the assertive level new and higher types of conduct arise. The most important of them for our purpose, on ac- count of their close association with what later becomes re- ligious conduct, are the types of action and speech known as rites and myths. " Janet called attention to E. Seilliere's studies in the "Philosophy of Imperialism." He agrees with Seilliere in making the desire to command one of the prime factors in social psychology, but would not call it "primi- tive," for it is unknown at the reflex level. He would also point out that the desire to command is complemented by the desire to be led. "2Amatory maladies may be classified under this head, for they involve an exaggeration of the desire to control another person, or submit to his control. Exaggerated generosity may be classified as exaggerated obedience.</page><page sequence="11">The best studies of rites have been made in central Australia and among American Indians; and it is upon these studies that Durkheim has based his conclusions as to the nature of the most primitive forms of the religious life. Janet regards these conclusions as, in the main, sound. He waives the objection that the Australians are not really primitive men, but only degenerates. What of it? After all, the mental nature of primitive men and that of certain degenerates are practically identical. Durkheim might have enriched his data-as Janet proposes to do-by studying child psychology and abnormal psychology. Guyau (L'lrreligion de l'avenir, 92 ff.) long ago pointed out that children, with their liking for "Just So stories," are natural ritualists; and psychopathic patients are many of them absurd sticklers for rules of the strangest nature. Moreover, many primitive rites survive in our codes of etiquette. Rites are complicated conducts, mixtures of movements and words, which bear the following characteristics. (I) Their least details are rigidly fixed. (2) Men compel one another to observe them (even though they show a tendency to fail to observe them themselves when not under supervision). (3) No reason, either logical or moral, can be given for them; they are not instinctive, and they are frequently contrary to physical re- quirements, as well as absurd and debasing. There are two chief elements in every rite, a physiological act (such as eating) and an elaborate em- broidery of it (represented by the whole code of table manners, for in- stance). They are best classified according to the species of complication, as Durkheim classifies them, for example: (I) negative rites of abstinence- taboos. These correspond to the various phobias of the nervous invalid, who cannot tell what he is afraid of and yet avoids certain things with a horror that is genuinely religious in its quality; (2) positive rites, in which complicating acts are added, not subtracted. According as the added act is pleasurable or painful, we get "ceremonial" or "piacular" rites. As for myths, they are not so primitive as rites, and are usually at- tached to them as an afterthought. Any explanation of a myth must first explain the rite on which it is founded. Most explanations of rites and myths err in coming to them with the presuppositions of a higher level of conduct. Spencer, for example, looks upon even these primitive beginnings of religion as an attempt to unveil the mystery of the universe; whereas the savage has no conception of mystery, since he has no conception of natural law; and need of explanation hardly acts at all as a motive at this level. Other explanations, on the other hand, err in trying to understand rites and myths in terms of lower levels of conduct. Durkheim, for example, says that they express the savage's wonder at what he feels in the presence of society, which to him is the source of all good and all evil. But rites and myths are not an in- evitable concomitant of all social life; cows are social, and know nothing of rites or myths. These arise at a higher level than the barely social level, and to seek to understand them in terms of society alone is to commit the error of "reducing higher to lower" against which Durkheim himself fre- quently warns the sociologist, and to guard against which he draws a sharp line between sociology and psychology, fearing to see sociology explained in terms of psychology, psychology in terms of biology, and eventually biology in terms of physics. Our explanation, said Janet, will seek to avoid both these errors, and to understand rites and myths in terms of the "assertive" level of conduct at which they arise. They are, in a word, the inevitable expression of the beginnings of will and belief. At this early stage the savage, like the child, talks not for any particular purpose, but for the sake of talking. Similarly, he wills for the sake of willing, and believes for the sake of believing-any- thing that comes into his head, without the least anxiety about consistency. 26 HORTON</page><page sequence="12">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 27 His only care is that what he wills, shall be carried out just so, and that what he believes shall be phrased just so. Belief and will are closely re- lated; belief is a deferred act of will; so myth and rite are closely related. The perfectly spontaneous character of primitive rites can perhaps be best perceived in the case of mimetic rites, in which the actions of the animal on which the tribe lives are aped. The rationalistic explanation of such rites-as found for example in Frazer's "Golden Bough"-solemnly sets forth the theory of "mimetic magic," based on the principle that an action similar to the wished-for action produces the wished-for action, and so, for example, the aping of the stages of growth of the "witchetty grub" makes more witchetty grubs grow. But the thing is much simpler than that. Observe the conduct of a group of sportsmen planning to go quail shooting. They generally feel it best to get together for a dinner before the hunt to "get their enthusiasm up"-particularly if quail are scarce and the pros- pects are poor. One after another tells stories of previous hunting trips. Heated by the presence of company and possibly also by the liquid refresh- ment, the speaker gives his imagination free rein. He gesticulates as he speaks; he points the gun, he follows the falling bird with his finger, he imitates its dying flutters. In action as well as in speech he paints the scenes he hopes to see tomorrow. The company breaks up with the firm conviction that there is to be great sport-and no amount of cold logic can disturb such a conviction. Such was the nature of primitive mimetic rites. The ritual imitation of lizards and grubs was only the primitive way of talking together about them, and so buoying one another up. The moral function of ritual conduct-and, be it noticed, we are here approaching the question of the function of religion- is most easily observable in the case of the group of ceremonial rites which might be termed Dionysiac or orgiac rites. Central among them, of course, stands ritual alcoholism itself. It was, and is, astoundingly prevalent in primitive religion. Initiation, marriage, bargaining, mourning, all had alcoholic accompaniments. Many savages acutally died of the effects of drunken initiation rites. One has only to think of the Greek orgiac cults, and of the Celtic cauldron that was the prototype of the Holy Grail, to realize how long such practices persisted in higher types of religion. Now the effects of alcohol are well known. It is what may be called a "mental poison," acting psychologically before it works physiologically. Its physiological result is the gradual paralysis of the higher brain centers, expressing itself in growing torpor; but before this phase sets in there is a phase when the psychological reserves, stimulated by the presence of the poison, open their gates and pour out a flood of psychic energy. The re- sults are most fascinating and exhilarating. The normal individual is given a superabundance of force, which expresses itself through a hundred chan- nels at once, action crowding upon action, and phrase upon phrase, so closely that they trip each other up. Ideas rush through the mind with incredible rapidity, giving one a sense of unlimited intellectual creativity. A feeling of well-being (euphoria), satisfaction, gaiety, characteristically religious in tone, comes over the mind. The real world, to which it is painful to adjust oneself, drops out of sight; one finds the whole world, oneself included, good and marvelous, and feels an expansive sense of charity toward all mankind; for drunkenness narrows the field of conscious- ness, and so, like certain religious states, diminishes the perception of the real and fills one with false, but reassuring confidence. It is not without significance that James treats specifically of drunkenness in his "Varieties of Religious Experience." To many individuals-Janet cited the case of a timid student-the first drink acts like a revelation and an inspiration. The sub-normal individual is often not intoxicated at all; he simply be-</page><page sequence="13">comes normal for once in his life. There are psychopathic sufferers who never lose sight of their suffering and become calm, clear-minded, and capable of reflexion and attention except when under the influence of alcohol. (For details, consult Janet's L' Alcoolisme etla depression mentale.) If it be clearly evident in the caso of ritual drunkenness that the func- tion of the rite is the stimulation of the mental reserve forces and the con- sequent toning-up of the emotional content of consciousness, it should now become no less clear that this is precisely the function of all other forms of ritual conduct. Some of them may well be classified as forms of "social drunkenness." Take such rites as those of the festival of "Intichiuma," described by Durkheim. Here you have certain rhythmical acts repeated simultaneously by the whole group, so that every individual gets the impression that every one else is imitating him, while shouts of mutual encouragement keep the ball a-rolling. Each member of the group is "a non-commissioned officer who feels like a general." It is vastly exhilarating; one acquires the same surplus energy and arrives at the same emotional state as that produced by alcohol, without the same danger of harmful after-effects. Similar phen- omena may be observed today on New Year's Eve and other popular feastivals.13 Or take a totally different type of ceremony: mourning. At first blush, primitive mourning rites do not seem to be calculated to heighten the energies or to tone up the emotions to the pitch of joy. The members of the tribe strike and wound one another ad lib., meanwhile tearing their own hair and howling dolorously. Yet Durkheim is right in pointing out that such rites actually have a comforting and strengthening effect, and grad- ually lift the mental level of the tribe, the chief mourners included, from apa- thetic grief up to cheerfulness. Here, as elsewhere, the function of religion seems to be to produce an increase of power (exaltation de la force) and a heightening of the mental level. Janet takes issue with Durkheim for setting up society as the sole fount of religious inspiration. "Social drunkenness" is only one source of inspiration. Alcohol itself is another. Pulling the hair, or any slight infliction of suffering, as in the case of funeral rites, may also bring out the psychic reserves. It is purely arbitrary to make the sacred coextensive with the social; one could make out just as good a case for the Great God Alcohol. Who knows? A monkey who got drunk may have been the founder of the human race! But although at this level of conduct we can discern a group of practices and beliefs out of which religion seems destined to arise, and can even determine the function which religion ful- fils-the calling out of the psychic reserves and the heightening of the mental tonus-we are not yet able to distinguish religious conduct from other types of conduct which fulfill the same function. We are still in the period of pre-religion, when religious beliefs and practices are still spasmodic, and not consistently carried out. There is a perpetual rhythm in the life of the savage, which carries him back and forth between the inspired, wildly enthusiastic, irrational conduct of the religious feast-day and the sober, utilitarian conduct of everyday life. There are physiological limits to religious frenzy, and the savage, 18A friend who sat up all night in a Paris cafe on New Year's Eve told me that some who drank scarcely a drop were as drunk as the rest- "socially intoxicated." Cf. negro revival-meetings. 28 HORTON</page><page sequence="14">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 29 on the whole, is pretty sane in observing those limits. Between religious spasms, he returns quite frankly to a common-sense basis of living, and does not let logic disturb him: though his myths may affirm that the Fish, the totem of his tribe, is every- where, he acts ordinarily as if fishes were to be found only in the water. Yet there always remains the possibility of taking religion too seriously: of carrying out religious practices and beliefs to the point of logical consistency, and so of passing over the borders of common sense into a world where fancy reigns supreme. Such is the case in the great age of religion, which begins with the advent of reflective thought. V. THE REFLECTIVE LEVEL: THE GREAT AGE OF RELIGION (I) Rise of the God-idea and Anthropopathic Conduct: Prayer and its Answer The most striking phenomenon which greets us as we enter the reflective period is the rise of the god-idea. With Leuba, whose description he follows quite closely at this stage, Janet considers that there is no real religion where there are no gods. An analysis of the god-idea, and an explanation of its rise and function, are hence essential for the understanding of religion. The characteristics of gods, or "spirits", may be summed up as follows. (I) A spirit is a man. To man of this period, the gods are thoroughly anthropomorphic and concrete. You may argue that they were only psy- chological entities; but to the believer in gods, as to the believer in healing springs or osteopathy, the helpful effects which really issue from his belief seem to issue from the object of his belief. Gods, then, behave like phy- siological entities: they fight, they speak, they give orders and punish the disobedient, like other men. (2) A spirit is powerful. This does not imply infinite power, or any other kind of infinitude. In actual practice, the gods are always finite; each man has "un petit dieu d son usage." (3) A spirit has a special function, incapable of performance by an ordinary human being. These functions vary with the needs of the wor- shipper. Each one is commonly attributed to a different spirit. The unity of God is a philosophical abstraction; real gods are always plural. "Man is not a monotheistic animal" (Guignebert, in a lecture on Hebrew Angel- ology). (4) A spirit is invisible. Not that one would wish to have it so; but since the gods do not exist, it is obvious that one can go on believing in them only on this hypothesis. The behavior which goes with the god-idea has been excellently described by Leuba under the name of "anthropopathic" behavior: acting as if an invisible human being were there. The believer honors the gods as he flatters men; humbles himself as before a chief; prays for favors; gives thanks for past favors, etc. Such a description is inclusive enough as an account of the believer's conduct; but meanwhile, what is the god doing? He must necessarily be answering to all this on his side, else the whole conversation would lapse. Of course he cannot answer directly, being non- existent; but that is not an insuperable difficulty: he answers through the believer, or at any rate through the man who specializes in belief, the priest.</page><page sequence="15">The priest is the differentiated function of making the god answer (faire parler le dieu); but this differentiated function could never have evolved unless it were implicitly capable of being exercised by each believer. The priest, moreover, would never be believed when he speaks for the god, did he not himself believe he heard the god speaking in him. It is impor- tant to add this unique type of conduct, making the god speak, to Leuba's list, if we are to get a complete view of the religious process. How did these strange beliefs and practices arise? The explanation depends upon an analysis of the new characteristics of conduct at the reflective level. Here the new and significant phenomenon is thought. Thought may be said to develop out of action by way of language. Before the rise of language, a man's thought about an object is simply his behavior toward it, and his thought about his neighbor is just his attitude toward him: a man's thought is the ensemble of his actions. Ideas or mental images of course exist subjectively in the mind; but they are bound up with attitude or nascent action so intimately as to be a part of it. Speech, how- ever, introduces a new element into the situation. At first, at the assertive level, it is merely the accompaniment of action, spontaneous and uncon- trolled. One can trust the child or the savage at this stage to reveal his real motives with absolute frankness. It is a momentous departure when he begins to "talk to himself" instead of "thinking out loud." How momentous it was may not at first be self-evident. Thought is only speech reduced to the point of imperceptibility. You cannot think the letter L without moving the tip of your tongue; many people never read or think without moving their lips. There is only a difference of degree between a loud command, a soft whisper, and a silent thought. Yet how primitive society must have been upset when silent thinking first became prevalentl Henceforth one never could know how to deal with a man; he might be saying one thing and thinking another. The advent of the secret and the wilful lie mark a great stage in human progress. The idea of a double, or spirit, existing invisibly behind that ensemble of visible actions that I call my neighbor, was the inevitable outgrowth, not of the dream experience, as Tylor thought, but of something that bulks much larger in the life of every man as soon as he begins to think; duplicity or double conduct. Animism springs up spontaneously at the moment when you first learn the necessity of distinguishing between the man who talks and acts as if he were your friend, and the invisible, inaudible enemy who lurks behind him. Previous to this there could be no conception of spirits inhabiting stones and trees, for there was no conception of the human spirit as distinct from the human body.'4 But how did the idea of god-spirits grow out of the idea of human spirits? The connecting link was conduct with respect to the absent. The animal is able to assume attitudes only toward that which is present; no physical object present, no stimulus. In man, however, memory keeps up the stimulus; it may be defined as conduct with respect to the absent. Now when the idea of an invisible double arises, it removes much of the barrier that separates conduct with respect to the present from conduct with 14Janet remarked that the whole idealistic tradition in philosophy (le spiritualisme) had sprung from this primitive and naive distinction between body and soul (action and thought). As a matter of fact, he said, thought is not a separate entity at all; it is "a little fragment of conduct." It would appear that Janet has not only a behavioristic psychology but also a behavioristic metaphysic. 30 HORTON</page><page sequence="16">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 31 respect to the absent. In both cases the same effort of the imagination is required; it is to my mental picture of my invisible neighbor that I ad- just myself in either case. A further step: the dead, so far as I remember them, belong to the same category. They, like my absent neighbor and the spirit of my present neighbor, are invisible; they affect my conduct just as much as do the merely absent, so long as I remember them. It is commonly recognized, that primitive men, as well as animals, behave toward the dead exactly as they do toward the absent-even to writing letters to them, and taking precautions against their return.15 The Australians have a curious custom that well illustrates the primitive view of death. They have two sets of burial rites, one at the time of death and the other some time later, at the close of the epoch of mourning. The first is to celebrate the death of the body; the second, the death of the spirit. During the period of mourning, the memory of the deceased has been kept alive; he has been looked upon as merely absent. Now the family is free to forget; and this is the second death, the death of the spirit. But there are those who do not forget, and who continue the absence-conduct with respect to the departed long after the laying away. A whole society of spirits thus grows up about every hearth and every tribal group-dead, but still active in men's minds. This it is which gives birth to animistic, anthropomorphic religion in the strict sense of the word.16 So far we have merely explained the belief in the existence of disembodied spirits. We have not explained why these spirits came to play an important part in human affairs, and why exalted functions came to be ascribed to them. If we look back upon the history of mankind, we shall see the gods becoming more and more inextricably involved in all man's efforts and aspirations, and assuming higher and nobler functions as man's moral nature evolves. All religions are alliances between a god and a group, but the human interest on which the alliance is based varies. At first it is based on fear: "Don't frighten us; don't hurt us; give us security!" The first gods were ill-disposed toward men, and this was the best that could be hoped from them. A new type of alliance became possible when there were some good gods to set over against the bad: "Help us to fight against our enemies and against evil gods!" The god becomes the general of the group; direction, guidance, is what is asked of him. Next comes the period of prayer in the proper sense, when all sorts of services and presents are asked of the god. Finally comes the period when, taught by experience, the wor- shipper asks only for spiritual goods: "Give me moral strengthening" (le reconfort moral)! In all ages, however, alliance with spirits has been the central religious fact. What are the psychological motives of this quest of a spiritual ally? They are very simple: the craving for direction and the craving for love. Direction may be defined as a form of authority mitigated by the benevo- lence of the leader. It is enormously satisfying and "cheap" to the person 5Levy-Bruhl, Les Fonctions mentales dans les societes inferieures, 360. '6It will be seen that Janet regards ancestor-worship, not nature- worship, as the primary form of religion-quite like Tylor and Spencer. He makes no attempt to account for the origin of nature-gods. Would he say that they are simply ancestral spirits that have taken up their abode in some specific natural object and become associated with some specific natural function; or would he say that the conception of double or spirit, first formed to account for the double conduct of men, was then applied, by analogy, to natural objects?</page><page sequence="17">guided. Mental diseases are often temporarily relieved when the patient comes under some strong authority, as when he is called for military ser- vice or enters a religious order. The feeble-minded are peculiarly subject to Schwarmerei for some pet father-confessor or spiritual director, and often become violently jealous of rival enthusiasts. The craving for love may be regarded as a variant of the craving for direction. It is not based wholly on the sex-instinct, as Freud thinks; it is a demand for aid in all the acts of life. The need for courage, for gaiety, for distraction, play a part in love quite as considerable as the sex need. None of these sentiments, be it observed, is specifically religious. There is no specifically religious sentiment; the only thing specific about the religious sentiment is its object, which is a spirit instead of a human being. But why cannot the sentiments just described be satisfied with human objects? To ask the question is to know the answer: because human directors and human friends are all too fallible and imperfect, and fortune often takes the best of them away from us. What ordinary human being is clairvoyant enough to know precisely what to tell me to do?- particularly since I have usually made up my mind beforehand, and want to be told to do just what I have decided to do! Perfect comprehension of all that I hope and fear, perfect appreciation of all my half-smothered efforts and hidden possibilities: this is what I crave of my director and my friend-and where shall I find such an one? After all, a visible but unideal friend is inferior to an invisible but ideal one. What everyone seeks, then, is an ideal, invisible, all-powerful, all-comprehending director and friend: a god. The need for direction and friendship finds its perfect satisfaction in religion; it is no accident that so many disappointed lovers turn to religion. We have explained why it is natural for men to seek a divine ally to meet their needs, but we have not yet explained how the god actually meets them; how he answers the prayers that as- cend to him. The question is highly important; we are not to suppose that religion ever could have persisted if the gods had never spoken. We have come, then, to the point when we must explain our phrase "making the god speak," and show how it is done. To understand the psychology of prayer-for that is the question now at issue-we must remind ourselves once more that we are at the reflective level of conduct, the level where thought arises; and we must remind our- selves of another characteristic of the the thought-process: its conversa- tional structure. Reflective thought is nothing more nor less than an interior discussion, modelled after the audible discussion of the market- place and the household, which preceded and provoked it. How is interior discussion possible? By the evoking of the adversary, real or imaginary, whose desires and intentions stand contrasted with those which struggle for expression within us at the moment. "We have a parliament within our head;" and in the debate we impersonate first one orator and then another. All thought is dramatic; but prayer differs from ordinary thought in that the drama is taken seriously. This, to be sure, involves a tiny mensonge ( soi-meme: but lying, after all, is a highly economical type of conduct, and lying to yourself-particularly when the falsehood is pleasant -is clear gain, for you are in no danger of being contradicted.17 And there 17Janet described the case of a young lady who wrote love-letters to herself, and half-deceived herself into believing in their genuineness, as well as wholly deceiving her family. She wept bitterly when the deception was discovered, and said the letters had given her great joy. HORTON 32</page><page sequence="18">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 33 have never been lacking certain psychopathic persons-mediums, vision- aries, dervishes, and the like-in whom the divine half of the conversation has appeared to be automatic and wholly independent of the control of the individual, and so authentically and convincingly divine. Janet described at length striking cases of pathological impersonation which have come under his observation at the Salptpri&amp;re. One young girl is convinced she is under the special protection of Ste. Philomene. After praying to the saint in her normal voice, she goes into a state of somnambul- ism, in which her whole voice and aspect changes. During this state she disposes pebbles in the form of a cross and makes other signs (as previously requested) to denote that the prayer has been favorably received. She then awakes, and shows every sign of delight at her prayer having been answered. A more extreme case is that of "Madeleine," who alternately plays the r61e of the worshipper at the foot of the cross and of the Christ on the cross- till she has developed a perfect set of stigmata-and who also alternates in the r61e of Mary and the Child, God's wife and God the husband, God's worshipper and God the teacher. In this last r61e she pronounces parables addressed to all mankind-some of them not bad-with a confidence that reminds one of the "thus saith the Lord" of the prophets. The scientific study of such cases, remarks Janet, dates only from the development of Spiritualism and Psychic Research, about I85o; but the phenomena are as old as mankind. Mental alienation in all its forms has always been regarded as divine; and the mentally alienated have always been the chosen mouthpieces of the gods. This does not always mean permanent mental alienation; in Madagascar, for example, a whole tribe intoxicates itself with a kind of beef-blood broth, after which different individuals in turn, as they reach the pitch of frenzy, impersonate the god and speak for him to the rest. It was out of such religious impersonations that drama developed. In all such divine utterances, strangeness (bizarrerie) and complica- tion are marked characteristics, and increase-as in the case of mediums- according to the number of unbelievers who are present. Dead languages and archaic terms play a great part in religious revelation. "All this," benevolently remarked Janet, "is not tromperie, as the I8th century philo- sophers thought; it is necessary, to distinguish ourselves from the god." (2) Psychological Analysis of Some Typical Religious Phenom- ena: A. Religious Faith: Its Loss and Restoration There is no religious phenomenon that throws so much light on the nature of religion as faith; and there is nothing that throws so much light on the nature of faith as scepticism. By sceptic- ism we do not mean the scepticism of the "tough-minded," who have found their moral tonic outside of religion, and can discuss religious issues flippantly, but rather the scepticism of the sin- cerely religious,-always a painful thing. The two types of scepticism, like the two types of belief which are their opposites, are quite unlike, psychologically. Keen religious thinkers have long insisted, with Pascal, that religious truth is different from other truth, being discerned by faith and not by reason, by the heart and not by the head. Psychological analysis proves that they are perfectly right. Religious scepticism, as a matter of fact, is commonest where one would least expect it: in the monasteries. Tardieu in his book on "Ennui" has described very carefully a mental disease which he calls asedia or "mental incompletude," which was rampant in the monasteries in the</page><page sequence="19">Middle Ages. It is characterized by loss of the sense of reality-not only God's reality but also the world's reality. In some cases the victim came to doubt the existence of the other monks. It was probably to combat the creeping-on of this mental numbness that the monks resorted to flagellation and other extreme forms of asceticism. Janet has himself observed three stages in the progress of this disease. In the first stage the patient-usually a stanch believer with no intellectual difficulties-complains that his love for God has vanished ("Je n'aime plus le bon Dieu"). He believes in God, but no longer takes any pleasure in the thought of Him. Prayer sounds hollow, and is accompanied by no "emotional harmonies." The case is precisely similar to that of the man who suddenly loses all affection for his family, and to whom the whole world becomes emotionally neutral. The second stage is that of scepticism proper. Belief in God vanishes, "like a light receding and going out," as one patient put it. Often no intellectual cause can be assigned. The third stage is that of the inversion of the sentiments. Bunyan's impulse to blas- pheme the name of Christ is a case in point. The patient is seized with the obsession to contradict just those beliefs that are most precious to him. It is a horrible experience, unknown to the intellectual sceptic, who is usually untroubled by his doubts. The psychological explanation is simple: it is purely a matter of the progressive impoverishment of the mental energies. Religion brings force in the end; but the initial act of belief which sets God before the mind takes a certain amount of energy, like any other act of reflection. Getting God's answer takes more. Some are so mentally depleted that even this slight strain is too much for them. When the patient has just enough strength to summon up the idea of God, you have stage (I); when he has not quite enough you have stage (2), in which the word God is brought before the mind, unaccompanied by the arguments for His existence or the recollection of past benefits; when mental bankruptcy is close at hand, and would ensue if the effort to believe were carried through, you get stage (3), in which the patient flees from the act of belief, impelled by an unconscious instinct of self-preservation. The cure of this disease, involving a recovery of faith and a new sense of mental power and stability, is what is known in America as "conversion." Janet expressed some surprise that American psychologists of religion should have given so much of their attention to so simple a phenomenon, and remarked that outside of Anglo-Saxon countries such experiences tended to have a less specifically religious connotation. He classified James' cases into "little conversions" (involving the reformation of drunk- ards and other moral delinquents), and "big conversions" (from doubt and fear to faith and confidence). The secular labels for these experiences would be resolution, and the cure of mental depression. Janet has often observed such cures brought about by purely physiological means. Moral influences, of course, are a great aid. General Booth hit upon the most powerful of these influences when he remarked that the most helpful thing in the world to a degraded man is the belief that some one else is interested in him. This friend, added Janet, need not necessarily be a human friend; the idea of an ideal, divine Friend, powerfully suggested to a man's mind, is even more effective. B. The Social Psychology of Faith: Fanaticism and Proselytism The nature of religious faith is again revealed in the attitude which the religious believer takes toward unbelievers. Just as the psychology of the religious sceptic differs from that of the HORTON 34</page><page sequence="20">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 35 philosophical sceptic, so does the psychology of the "defender of the faith" differ from that of the advocate of a philosophical theory. In a purely philosophical discussion each disputant is at the start convinced of the truth of certain propositions, and yet he is resigned to the possibility that he may be defeated in the argument, and have to change his convictions. The reorganization of one's convictions under the in- fluence of new truth is indeed a fatiguing operation, but to a healthy person it is essentially pleasurable, and to be welcomed on the whole. Hence the philosophical disputant is polite to his adversary-knowing he may be the victor-and observes the rules of the game with strict honesty, much as if he were playing a friendly game of cards, except that the arbiter in this more dignified game is not Luck, but Truth. Unless these virtues of resignation to possible defeat, respect for the adversary, and intellectual honesty are present, philosophical discussion comes to naught. In a religious discussion, on the other hand, precisely these virtues are characteristically lacking. Dishonesty of the most flagrant sort is rampant in religious discussion; time and time again has Janet discovered incorrect citations in apologetical writings. As for politeness, one hardly needs to insist upon the fact that religious writings combine a ludicrous pride with an equally ludicrous scorn of the adversary. The name of the "-ism" one is defending is always accompanied by resounding epithets,-"l'auteur se grise de mots sonores,"-while no religious writer can mention materialism or atheism without calling it names: "abject materialism," or what-not.18 As a typical instance of the religious man's lack of scientific resignation, Janet quoted a phrase from a letter sent him by a man who was taking the course: "Whatever you may say, you will change nothing in my religious convictions." The religious disputant is like a child who will not play un- less he wins. The conclusion is obvious: in religious discussion we are not engaged in a mere playful skirmish; we are fighting for our lives. Religious discussion is less like a friendly game than like a hand-to-hand grapple with a brigand who threatens our life and property. In such a struggle, all rules go by the board. But if the aggressions of unbelief are a matter of life or death to the believer, the aggressions of religions are-quite literally, in many cases-a matter of life or death to the unbeliever, and to adherents of rival faiths. Proselytizing zeal is a characteristic mark of every real religion; and prosely- tism means determination to convert by hook or by crook, by reason or by force, and never to rest content while a single heathen remains outside the fold. It is noteworthy that conversion by reasoning is very rare; the senti- ments must always be appealed to. In earlier times converts were more apt to be frightened into the fold; now they are more apt to be seduced into it by the promise of benefits. Miracles have figured enormously in evangelistic arguments. They are not to be defined as inexplicable, irreproducible events (here Janet recanted an earlier definition of his own). They are essentially events following some religious act and bearing the official religious signature. A woman who recovered her speech in some strange fashion that science could not explain would not necessarily call it a miracle; but if the mysterious healing ensued upon a pilgrimage to our Lady of Lourdes, it would be a miracle. For us today, inexplicability is the signature of the divine par excellence; but it was not always so. For our simple-minded girl, who typifies the primitive attitude, the pebbles laid in the shape of a cross were a sufficient signature of the divine. Miracles tend to be the court of last appeal in arguments between an evangelist and his rival. "'Cf. what a Catholic friend said to me of Janet himself: "C'est un materialiste de gros ventre."</page><page sequence="21">But when arguments break down, what then? For a scientist or a philosopher, the failure of a proposed miraculous test would be conclusive, but for the evangelist anger, not resignation, is the reaction. All other methods failing, persecution is resorted to. All real religions have inflicted martyrdom as well as suffered it. If Protestantism has indulged in per- secution in spite of its principle of individual testing of truth, that simply proves, remarks Guyau, that it is a religion and not a philosophy. How explain religious persecution? Murisier, in his "Maladies du sen- timent religieux," has attributed it to an instinctive impulse of self-defence. We suffer if we cannot unify our beliefs into a system, particularly if this system of belief is what we live by. The existence of persons who dispute our convictions breaks up this unity and causes great pain, especially to the weak and sensitive, and those who are already troubled by doubts. It is the doubter to whom his neighbor's unbelief causes the most acute distress; such phenomena as the Inquisition were not the result of an excess of faith, but of apprehensive uncertainty in an already shaken Church. Janet thinks Murisier's explanation of persecution on the whole sound, but would add that the desire for mastery that is at the root of imperialism is also influential. Your converts give you a feeling of power and increase your own faith. Desire for intellectual unity, desire for relief from mental depression, and desire for the encouragement and sense of power that others' agreement brings with it: these are the three chief motives of persecution. C. Demonic Possession The phenomenon of demonic possession is found in all religions, and may be regarded as the characteristic religious malady in the life of the individual, as persecution is in the life of society. Wherever you have the belief in spirits you find cases of it; and if it is uncommon today in civilized society, except among Spiritualists, that is only what is to be expected. Demonic possession may be classified as a derangement of the active functions. In contrast to certain manias in which the patient is acutely sensitive to external criticism, the possessed man realises that his distress has its source within him; and yet the acts which trouble him, performed obviously by himself, are so contrary to his own habits and character that they seem to be those of a foreign person, hostile to himself, who has some- how got possession of him. This is the interpretation universally made wherever the belief in spirits exists. Possession may be best understood if we compare it with prayer. Both are double conducts, in which the subject plays two r6les; but in the former case the subject considers his second personality to be evil (a devil or demon), while in the latter case he is sure it is good (a god, or saint). Why is this? Well, to start with, the physiological and moral effects are bad in possession and good in prayer. Janet's patient who held con- verse with Ste. Philomene also held converse with a bad spirit whom she called Joseph; Ste. Philomene made her healthier, morally stronger, and happier; Joseph gave her indigestion and bad circulation, and tended to break down her will, making her suggestibility rise and reflectiveness fall. Thus she had no more difficulty in discerning the two than had Ste. Teresa in discerning the good God from the evil spirits. But why have possession and prayer opposite effects? It is partly due to the content or character of the personality evoked, but chiefly because in prayer one remains master of the inward drama-the divinity's speech can be stopped at will-while in possession the second r61e gets beyond 36 HORTON</page><page sequence="22">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 37 control, and the first r61e disappears. A demoniac is like a spectator at the theatre who gets so engrossed in the play that he thinks the hero's life is really in danger, and shouts "Stop!" to the villain. Possession is simply a case of bad prayer. Prayer, or the carrying on of two r6les, is indeed a difficult and danger- ous operation. If you don't succeed in making the second personality real, you get "spiritual dryness," the first stage in asedia, as we have already seen; while if you make it so real that you get carried away with it, you find yourself possessed by a demon. Because of this double danger, re- ligion has always sought to take away from the average individual the function of being his own God, and getting his own answers to prayer. The priesthood tends to acquire a monopoly of divine revelation, and it is always hostile to the prophet, who claims to receive direct revelation from official channels. D. Ecstasy Religion has always attributed great importance to certain pathological mental phenomena; but as fast as science explains these phenomena, she tends to retreat to other strongholds of inexplicability and abnormality. In antiquity, idiocy was looked upon with awe; fifty years ago, it was somnambulism that forged to the front; today, since somnambulism has been explained, it is ecstasy that is regarded as the authentic form of communion with the divine. But ecstasy is just as susceptible of psychological explanation as somnambulism, if we will only turn from the accounts given by 15th and I6th century mystics of their own experiences-accounts confused by the use of traditional literary phrases borrowed from other mystics-and study ecstasy in its present-day form, as it appears in the psychopathic clinic. Ecstasy has many forms, as various as the mental content that is brought into it. In addition to religious ecstasy, one might enumerate social and political ecstasy (cf. those of Nietzsche and J. J. Rousseau), amorous ecstasy, and literary ecstasy. As a typical example Janet preferred to take one of these religiously neutral cases, that of a young man who was seized with the idea that he might become a great poet, and who, as he finished his mediocre little volume, was filled with such a sense of exaltation and illumination that he felt "obliged to close the blinds" lest the neighbors should see the radiance that surrounded him. The experience so convinced him of the excellence of his verse that he has continued to write for five hours a day the rest of his life, although he has never had a thing accepted; and he has often declared to Janet that the glory of Victor Hugo and of Napoleon is not to be compared with his. If one remarks that his "glory" is not very evident to the casual observer, he lays his hand upon his heart and remarks with an ineffable smile: "J'ai la gloire." Beneath all the various forms in which the ecstatic experience appears there is a constant psychological and physiological pattern. Physical movements are reduced to a minimum; the patient wishes to be let alone. The psychological tonus mounts up, and a wave of calm, passive, beati- tudinous joy sweeps over him. The actions become unreflective, and hence automatic. The subject feels inspired, uplifted, illuminated. Literal photisms sometimes occur. An emphatic conviction grows that whatever happens to be in the mind is true, and immensely important. Complete conviction would be objective and active; ecstatic conviction is not really complete; its forcefulness is due to the fact that the patient blurs the dis- tinction between objective and subjective, as the young literary man</page><page sequence="23">blurred the distinction between objective and subjective "glory." So in religious ecstasy one feels the "immediate presence of the divine," but ob- jects to raising the question whether the divine is objective or subjective. Ecstasy in some ways resembles somnambulism, but differs from it in that the memory of the experience is preserved, and the effects of it often last all through life. It is best classified-paradoxical as this may seem- under the head of agitation. It belongs to a small group of manic disturb- ances in which-unlike other mental disturbances-joy and not depression, certitude and not doubt, power and not weakness, are the prevailing notes. It differs, however, from these cognate maladies in that the maniac ex- pends his increased energy in motor agitation, while the ecstatic is motion- less; and so the forces which would have been expended in activity heighten the subjective experience of joy and certainty to a much greater degree than in the active forms of the disease. In both cases a fit of depression or "dryness" follows the experience, showing that the mental reserves have been heavily drawn upon. The value and dangers of ecstasy are equally evident. It is an ex- perience that religion treasures, and mistrusts. It is treasured; for religion treasures all that adds to personal happiness, which is religion's goal. It is mistrusted; for the natural outcome of ecstasy in its extreme form is the belief that I, the ecstatic, am God, which gives me such absolute confidence in myself that I am apt to become a religious revolutionary. Hence the cautiousness with which Mysticism has always been handled by the Church. (3) Do the Gods Exist? Our study of certain religious phenomena,-particularly the phenomenon of faith,-while it has certainly deepened our im- pression of the value of religion as a moral stimulant, has un- doubtedly raised in our minds the question of the truth of religion. It is the time now to examine the metaphysical affirmations of religious belief, and to ask ourselves whether the gods who function psychologically in the human act of prayer really exist, or are simply ideas. If we are to ask this question intelligently, observed Janet, we must not fail to realize that the verb "to exist" has different meanings at the different levels of conduct, and that there are different sorts of existences corresponding to these different meanings. We may distinguish, for ex- ample, between things and facts. A thing is something that is real at the perceptive level; it exists inasmuch as it is perceived. A fact is something that is real at the experimental level; it is believed in because experimentally verified. Religious entities are neither things nor facts; they correspond rather to the assertive and reflective levels, and have a different mode of existence: they might be termed beings or realities. Belief in a fact of science and belief in a religious reality are two en- tirely different matters. In the former case, belief comes step by step, beginning with the bare hypothesis of existence and gaining in strength bit by bit as the hypothesis gains confirmation from experience. In the latter case, belief comes all at once, a priori, and no amount of experience can discredit it. Religious believers are like the young lady to whom it was hypnotically suggested that she had undergone an operation of a somewhat major nature; her head had been amputated. The belief so crowded other possibilities out of her mind that when brought before a mirror she saw her reflection only up to her neck, and when asked to feel herself and see if her head were not still there, she never moved her hand up beyond the supposed place of amputation. In other words, she ad- 38 HORTON</page><page sequence="24">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 39 mitted only positive instances, confirming the hypothesis, and no negative instances. The argument "How can you see that your head is gone if you have no eyes," had absolutely no effect upon her; she was argument-proof as well as experience-proof. We have mentioned that religious belief comes all at once; we may add that it tends to go all at once. "All or nothing," says the religious man; "either my belief is absolute, divine truth, or else it is a lie." There are no degrees of probability in religious truth; when it ceases to be considered absolutely certain, it is violently repudiated, and the loss of belief in it is often accompanied by nervous collapse. Scientific or philosophical truth does not thus engage our loyalties; one would never die for a scientific theory or a philosophical proposition; but for a religious belief one may die as one does for country. We believe in "realities" more violently than we believe in facts. But the most momentous differences between facts and realities is this: facts are believed-in because they exist; realities exist because they are believed-in. If you ask why I believe a fact, I very properly proceed to "prove" it to you. If you ask "why" I believe in a religious reality, I shall, if I am honest, tell not my reasons-they are for my neighbor, not for me, and never convinced anyone anyhow-but my motives. Religious beliefs arise at the assertive and reflective levels of conduct, where desire and belief are identical. What I wish were true, that I believe to be true. The gods are realities inasmuch as they give perfect satisfaction to a fundamental, human need: the need of alliance, of friendship, of companionship and direction in the struggle of life. Today there can be no question of the fact that religious beliefs are being disintegrated by being forced to live in a philosophical and scientific atmosphere. Religion is a synthetic act, philosophy is an act of analysis; and wherever analysis is applied to religion, it withers away. For example, reflective analysis shows us that the primary religious act, prayer, has three moments in it: the worshipper's petition, the worshipper's response to his own petition, and the glow of satisfaction resulting therefrom, which starts the process circling round a second time, and so on. But the wor- shipper never analyzes his act; he takes it as unitary experience, bringing satisfaction and hence justifiable. Let him once analyze it, however, and at once he perceives how fearfully problematic is the supposed "reality" he meets in it. Stop the Egyptian priest at the moment when he is about to speak through the tube that leads to the mouth of the image of the god and makes the temple to resound with the thunders of the divine response; ask him whether it is really a god or a man who is speaking; stop our feeble- minded girl at the moment when she is arranging the pebbles in the shape of a cross, and ask her whether it is really Ste. Philomene who is doing it; and you will forever destroy the religious faith of that priest and that girl. Analysis kills religion. And yet there lingers in the minds of all of us a predilection for the old beliefs; they are part of the habits and tendencies that form our social heritage; and they are so true to human desire that the "will to believe" half convinces us they are true. Many a hard-headed, free-thinking old peasant turns to the Church in time of bereavement for the comfort he cannot find, and sinking himself for the time below the level of analysis, finds in the mysterious drama of the Mass-the living presence of the Bon Dieu, the promise of resurrection, the august countenance of the priest, the silent sympathy of his neighbors who crowd the aisles-an experience of renewed courage that half convinces him as it fully consoles him. (4) The Fruits of Religion: Morality and Logic. Before we turn our attention to the period of religious disintegration at</page><page sequence="25">which we have hinted, it is but proper that we should recognize the services which religion has rendered to contemporary civil- ization. Foremost of all is this: it has made morality in the modern sense. Some years ago there was a significant controversy between Spencer and Paul Janet19 on the origin of ethical duty. Spencer said that duties are simply commandments of the chief, in the first place. Paul Janet questioned this. (I) Moral commands, he pointed out, have a certain dignity, a categorical quality, which the chief's commands do not always possess. One may question the rightness of the chief's command; one never questions the rightness of a real moral command, even when one disobeys it. (2) Obedience to the chief is conditioned on his presence; obedience to a moral command is just as imperative in secret as in public. (3) Obedience to the chief involves ennui, and even humiliation before both the chief and one's fellow slaves; obedience to the moral law brings pride, accompanied by a feeling of censorious contempt for the disobedient. "La vertu vous egale a Dieu"-you feel like a master, not like a slave. Both Spencer and Paul Janet were too anxious to form an artificial cleft between religion and morality to perceive the obvious solution to all their difficulties; viz, that duties are the commandments, not of the chief, but of the gods (who, to be sure, speak mainly through the chief). Against this hypothesis, all Paul Janet's objections are powerless. (I) The superior dignity and categorical quality of duty are due to the fact that the gods are more powerful than any chief; a god is to a chief what a general is to a corporal. (2) It is obvious that, since the gods are invisible and may be watching you at any time, resistance against them is impossible; and so one obeys in secret as in public. (3) As for the pride that accompanies moral obedience, it is due to the fact that the god's command is uttered within us, invisibly, and we get the sense that we are commanding as well as obeying. Since the gods are psychological entities, moral autonomy is a fact. Ever since the rise of religion, morality has borne the religious stamp; and in the great epoch of religion it was simply an appendage of religion. It is absurd to deny this historical fact, as Spencer and Paul Janet and that whole generation of philosophers tried to do. A striking confirmation of it may be found in the pathology of the moral experiences, which is sub- stantially identical with that of the religious experience. Moral doubts and "scruples," moral "dryness," correspond to religious asedia and may go to the same extremes. Corresponding to demonic possession we find cases of obsessing "voices" that tempt the conscience satanically. Corresponding to religious ecstasy we find a form of moral ecstasy in which one becomes convinced that one is morally perfect. Morality has much the same func- tion as religion; it comforts and directs. Obviously it is a simple outgrowth of religion. To try to keep morality alive (in its traditional form) while destroying religion is to try to keep a tree alive after cutting its root. The type of morality fostered by religion may be best described as egoistic. This is not a depreciatory term. Egoism is a great step forward in moral progress, and does not arise until the reflective level is reached. Hitherto man acted on each desire as it arose-only to regret it afterward. Now he learns to call all his desires into consultation before making any decision, latent as well as clamorous desires, and learns to balance the future against the present. This "calculus of interests," as Bentham called it, is enormously difficult; neurotic people are incapable of it; for them, egoism "Paul Janet (1823-99), the well-known author of Les causes finales (I874), was the uncle of Pierre Janet. They collaborated in some experi- ments in telepathy. 40 HORTON</page><page sequence="26">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 41 is an ideal so high as to be practically unattainable. Religion has here furnished its greatest contribution to moral progress, the greatest "aid to reflection" ever devised: the fear of future punishment. Future pain needs to be exaggerated in order to make it counterbalance present pleasure in the moral calculus. This is just what religion does, with its picture of Hell. Thus, subordinating and organizing his desires, man for the first time be- comes ego, an individual; and this achievement is in no small measure due to religion. Logic as well as morality bears the imprint of religious influence. It is ridiculous, as a matter of fact, to separate logical laws from moral laws. Logic is only intellectual morality. The need for it arose with the appear- ance of language. You cannot perform two contradictory actions at the same time; matter resists you; but you can say or think two contradictory things at the same time. From the moment when man first began to speak, he began to dire des bttises. Hence the regulation of language be- came as important to the tribe as the regulation of conduct, for uniformity of opinion was one of the conditions of social unity. The principles of logic originally took shape in moral form, with religious sanctions attached. "Do not forget your promises immediately; remain faithful to yourself for a time at least:" this was the original form of the principle of contradic- tion. "When your chief (behind whom stands the god) has one opinion, do not dare oppose him": this command is at the basis of all logic.20 VI. THE ERGETIC (OR RATIONAL) AND THE EXPERIMENTAL LEVELS: THE DECLINE OF RELIGION (I) Influences Making for the Destruction of Religion There are four important types of conduct which appear for the first time at either the ergetic or the experimental level: work, education, philosophy, and science. All of them are, directly or indirectly, fruits of religion; but all of them tend to exercise a destructive influence upon religion-an instance of the general law that things tend to destroy themselves by their own fullest development. A fire tends to put itself out with the carbonic acid gas it generates; and when religion creates too many virtues, they turn against her. A leading characteristic of the morality engendered by religion is that it is ergetic: work and effort play a large part in it. Work may be defined as the mustering of extra force for a given result by the exertion of continuous effort. It is not a primitive tendency, and it plays a small part in primitive morality. It requires that an artificial force be given to ideals and aims which, lying in the dim future, have not of themselves sufficient force to sustain the inconstant will during long-continued exertions; and it requires that the passions which tend to interrupt all continuous effort be disci- plined and subdued. This is precisely what religion has done with its doctrines of divine supervision and future punishment. It has led to absurd excesses of asceticism, no doubt; but the development of the power to resist pain and repress passion has been incalculably important in the prog- ress of the race. The motives appealed to may have been egoistic; the end in view may have been the eternal happiness of the individual; but self- sacrifice and disinterested heroism have paradoxically enough been the fruits of this egoism. The truth is that all lines of conduct that are entered upon as means to ulterior ends have a tendency to become ends in them- 20Janet's debt to Durkheim at this point hardly needs to be pointed out.</page><page sequence="27">selves. Thus the ascetic virtues laid down by religion as means to eternal happiness came to be "their own reward," and ergetic morality, in which effort, sacrifice, and altruism predominate, came to be more independent of the religion that engendered it. At last came the time when morality felt sure enough of its own strength to turn upon religion and seek to expurgate it. One of the chief by-products of the ascetic or ergetic temper is education. In primitive morality, systematic education has little place. Hereditary instinct as modified by social imitation shapes primitive conduct. Real education is work of the most strenuous sort, involving the stifling of the inclinations at every step. As such, it is obviously a child of religion; and yet the characteristic methods of education are dangerous for religion. Analysis, for example, kills passion. We have already seen how it tends to destroy belief in prayer. The syllogism, again,-which is primarily a tool of instruction,-creates a new ascetic morality of the intellect. Love of truth emerges for the first time. Truths, unlike religious "realities," are accepted not because they please us but because they conform to certain categorical rules like the rules of the syllogism. Now for the first time falsehood is regarded with horror; agnoscatur veritas, ruat coelum. The consequence is inevitable: logic turns against religion's absurdities as morality has turned against its indecencies. A period of rapid theological evolution now begins. The local gods are arranged in families and hierarchies; many of them are identified with others that have similar functions; monotheism is the eventual outcome of the process. The function of speaking for the god in oracles and prophecies tends to come under sharp scrutiny. As a result, revelation tends to be relegated to the past, and its interpretation monopolized by a priesthood. The gods themselves take on new characters; their commands become more moral and less arbitrary. During this period of ethical and logical evolution a new phenomenon arises: philosophy. Philosophy is religion evolving faster than she is willing. This, at any rate, is what philosophy has been at its most fruitful periods. Cousin and his school have come in for a good deal of abuse on the ground that their philosophy was merely a rationalization of traditional dogma; but this is what the classical philosophy of Socrates and Plato really was. Any philosopher who tries to ignore tradition, and start de novo on a basis of pure reason, simply cheats himself, as Descartes did. Particularly absurd was Descartes' attempt to deduce such a religious dogma as the existence of God from logical principles. Religious concepts can be built up only out of religious motives. The one really sincere and straightforward philosophical argument for the existence of God is Anselm's ontological argument. Anselm does naively what Descartes does unconsciously: he bases everything on the will to believe. For if the ontological argument be translated into un- technical language, so as to expose the psychology that lies behind it, it will read as follows: "God is so good that it would be a pity if he did not exist." It is a passional argument, arising out of the assertive level of mental development, where I believe firmly whatever I wish were true. It might be compared with the following arguments: "This wine tastes so good that it must be good for me;" "This story is so good that it must be true." Philosophical religion is of course more moral and more logical than traditional religion; but on the whole it proves an unsatisfactory substitute. Matters are greatly complicated by the fact that the gods at this period come to be taken as explanatory principles. Explanation is not primarily a religious interest, but more probably grows out of magic. The function of the gods is not so much to satisfy the rational need for explanation in the case of extraordinary phenomena as to guide and sustain the believer in his HORTON 42</page><page sequence="28">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 43 practical life. But now the magical interest comes to be fused with the religious, and philosophy seizes upon this secondary aspect of the gods rather than upon the fundamental one. The result is that although the "God" of philosophy is pure of all moral imperfections and logical incon- sistencies, and although he still bears after all amputations, a most striking resemblance to the God of religion, he is practically unsatisfactory to the religious man. Philosophical religion is like the "rational drink" which a benevolent doctor once invented, compounded of molasses and water. It looked like wine, it smelled like wine, it tasted like wine; but nobody would drink it. Our good physician, remarked Janet, had omitted one important ingredient; "il avait oubli l'alcool." But finally there issues from the ascetic, ergetic impulse created by religion an enemy more formidable than philosophy: experimental science. Science is the most radically inhibitory influence to which human conduct has yet been subjected. It is so different from philosophy that Janet puts it on a separate mental level. Ergetic morality had already inhibited all instincts that warred against the welfare of the whole individual life. Logic had gone farther and inhibited all mutually self-contradictory be- liefs and modes of conduct growing out of them. But not all even mutually consistent beliefs and not all impeccable philosophical systems succeed, when used as means of adjustment to the external environment. This test of success has always had an inhibitory influence on human opinions; trial- and-error conduct has always governed the ordinary affairs of life, even when religious morality was at its height; but the conscious cult of success, the effort to subject all beliefs to the impartial and stern judgment of external nature, was a new and momentous departure. The ego had been subjected to the authority of logic; now human logic itself was to be subjected to the overruling authority of Nature. Verification had at first been left to the individual; next the agreement of other minds had been required; now impersonal instruments became the tools of verification. Obviously, the effect upon all types of conduct and belief was bound to be far-reaching. In morality, the scientific spirit insisted on eliminating all harmful or merely arbitrary customs and rules, and leaving nothing but reason and hygiene as the guides of life. In religion, it completely under- mined the process of acting and self-deception which formed the warp and woof of the religious life. It destroyed the credibility of the miracles on which religious apologetic chiefly based its arguments; and when religion retreated into the past and entrenched itself behind the marvels of the Age of Revelation, historical science stormed the redoubt and chased re- ligion out of her refuge. All she could do was to capitulate, accept the scientific spirit with as much grace as possible, and try to become experi- mental herself. Thus it is that within the last century we have seen the rise of a number of new types of religion, or substitutes for religion, all agreeing, in spite of their vast differences, in their willingness to submit to the experimental test. (2) The Break-up of Religion: Substitutes for Religion We may best understand the odd phenomena which meet us in recent religious history if we remind ourselves once more of the three moments in the act of prayer: interrogation, arising out of the need for direction and companionship: answer, coming through a secondary personality which the worshipper feels to be more or less detached from his own; satisfaction, or the glow of joyous feeling which ensues on all stimulation of the energies and sends one back to repeat the experience. Each one of these moments involves and reinforces the others. Now</page><page sequence="29">a little reflection will convince us that religion in recent years has been breaking up into its constituent moments. The inter- rogatory moment, or the search for the gods, has been taken over by philosophy-and the search will go on for ever, for by philosophy's methods the gods can never be found. The re- sponsive moment, or the answer of the gods, has been taken over by Spiritualism. The moment of satisfaction has been taken over by Romanticism or the Religion of Sentiment. We have already seen that philosophy fails to meet the character- istic religious need for guidance and inspiration; it may be ignored as a substitute for religion. Spiritualism and Romantic- ism, however, really meet that need to some extent, and so deserve more consideration. Spiritualism, or the attempt to converse through "mediums" with disembodied spirits, is a very ancient phenomenon; but modern Spiritual- ism, which developed about I850, is different from all that went before in that the atmosphere of prayer and belief which used to make it very easy to get spirit-responses is exchanged for the atmosphere of scientific curiosity. Modern spiritualism is analytic; it tries to isolate the answer of the god from the question of the believer, and scientifically to control the conditions of its production, with a view to proving that extra-human agencies are really at work. It feverishly seeks for mediums, or specialists in self- deception and other types of unconscious trickery, and then sternly tells them not to cheat. The progress of investigation along these lines is gradually discrediting Spiritualism as a candidate to fill the vacancy left by religion. First it was definitely proved that the table-tipping ascribed to the "spirits" was per- formed by the medium. This compelled a retreat; the believers insisted that mystery still remained: whence came the ideas and the impulses of the medium, so strangely automatic? Were they not inspired in the medium by a "spirit-control"? This led to the study of psychological automatism and the whole realm of the subconscious. These studies have been very fruitful for psychology, but very disastrous for the Spiritualistic hypothesis. The only thing that remains unquestioned is the sincerity of all genuine mediums: they are people who think they are acting involuntarily, and not tricking. A more wide-spread and promising movement than Spiritualism, though not so well defined, is Romanticism. Its fundamental proposition is that wherever you find joy, strength, and satisfaction, there you have the immediate evidence of the divine. As exponents of this cult Janet named such oddly assorted people as Renan, Spencer, Henri Bois, Ritschl, New- man, and James. James is of course the classic example. Like all Romanticists he has a scorn for rational demonstrations of the existence of God; he does not even mention the proofs from miracle and tradition. But he fills his "Varieties of Religious Experience" with satisfied people, strong and joyous because of their religious experience, and rests the case for the validity of religion on its capacity for creating these "sthenic emotions." In so doing, however, he betrays the weakness as well as the strength of the Romantic position, and sober religious thinkers have not unreasonably taken alarm at his book. For one thing, he has been led by a sure psycho- logical insight to include among the joy-producing and hence at least quasi-religious experiences such pathological phenomena as alcoholic drunkenness, "anaesthetic revelations," and extreme forms of ecstasy. But this, as Vernon Lee points out in her book on "Vital Lies," is to "betray HORTON 44</page><page sequence="30">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 45 religion into the hands of the psychologists." If all that stimulates the sthenic emotions is divine, alcohol and laughing-gas become gods, and ecstasy, which has been frowned upon by such religious leaders as Bossuet and Arnauld, becomes the very soul of religion. As soon as secular parallels are drawn to all the typical religious experiences-and psychology is capable of doing this-the collapse of this particular argument for religion will become evident to all. A still more fundamental objection to James' argument is slyly insinuated in Boutroux's admirable introduction to the French edition of the "Varieties:" do enthusiasm and joy always go with the truth? Is not the scientific spirit the negation of this spirit? How, then, is the fact that religion engenders these emotions an argument for the truth of religion? Why, after all, observed Janet, should one assume that men might be brought back to religion if it could be proved that superior spiritual beings existed? Suppose the Spiritualists definitely proved the reality of "spirit- controls." Suppose James' hypothesis were substantiated; that there exist superior minds continuous with our own, that occasionally make incursions into our subconsciousness. Should we really be happy to meet such beings? They would be to us what we are to the animals and to men of lower intelligence; has it been on the whole a happy experience for ani- mals and savages to come into contact with our superior intelligences? One wonders if a real race of gods would not treat us as H. G. Wells' men from Mars are imagined to do. The gods of religion are no such super- human intelligences; they are only as big and great and wise as we wish and need them to be. They answer to our needs as only our own creations could do. Even enemy-gods like our devil are conceived to be stupid as well as wicked, so that we can outwit them and get the satisfaction of struggle and victory. An interesting book might be written on the "psy- chology of the devil;" he has been a great comfort to humanity for centuries. Real gods would not be so easy to outwit if evil, or to conciliate if well- disposed; there is all the difference in the world between writing a romance and conducting a real courtship. Modern romanticism has not, as a matter of fact, been confined to those who continue to believe in the reality of spiritual beings. The search for emotional stimulation has been carried on quite outside the pale of religion, and the waning of religion has swelled the ranks of the senti- mentalists and mystics. Seilliere's studies on the various types of what he calls "mysticism"-which now fill twenty volumes-have given us a wealth of data on this whole subject. He mentions four distinct varieties of mysticism. (I) Erotic mysticism (le mysticisme passionnel). Since Rousseau, a new type of love-story has pervaded literature, in which the hero and heroine are not praised for rising above passion, nor viewed with a mixture of censure and pity for succumbing to it, but in which on the contrary passion is glorified and worshipped as something divine. After Rousseau, the classic exponent of this tendency is George Sand. A cognate tendency to worship other emotions-in fact, all emotions-as divine runs through the whole literature of the Romantic period and has been revived in very recent years. It tends to become the worship of instinct, since the instincts bear the highest emotional charges. (2) Social, political, moral mysticism. Here the object of worship is one's own class, nation, or race, and in certain extreme cases one's own personality (moral perfection). Socialism, nationalism, and race imperial- ism are cases in point. Gobineau, H. S. Chamberlain, and Nietzsche may be mentioned as exponents of this type. The tendency of all these is to strengthen the self-confidence and self-assertiveness of the individual and group.</page><page sequence="31">(3) Aesthetic mysticism. Some people stimulate themselves by the worship of beauty as others do by the worship of their group. The desire to believe in one's own distinction and superiority is served by this cult quite as well as by social mysticism. To believe that I am an artistic genius is quite as stimulating as to believe that I belong to a superior group or race. Flaubert may be mentioned as a typical aesthetic mystic. (4) Philosophical mysticism. A great deal of the philosophy that we have been flooded with since the Romantic epoch is not inspired at all by a serious desire to know, or to systematize recognized facts. It has been written to satisfy the emotional needs of the author. He has never taken the trouble to study the facts of science or to ponder upon the meaning of life; but he finds it emotionally stimulating to contemplate the Absolute- whatever that may mean-and to compose a grandiloquent tone-poem upon the theme of Creation, well orchestrated with sonorous philosophical terms. Janet objected to Seilliere's use of the term "mysticism," which he thinks should be applied only to certain specifically religious phenomena; but he recognized that all these forms of what he prefers to call "romantic- ism" or "sentimentalism" have something closely akin to religion. He pointed out that the pathology of all Seilliere's "mysticisms" is identical with that of religion. For example, a recurrent phenomenon in the literature and in the political, aesthetic, and metaphysical thinking of the Romantic period is obscurity. What is obscurity? It is not identical with abstruseness or profundity. If one ponders long enough on a difficult mathematical theo- rem or on a profound scientific theory, it becomes perfectly clear; but obscurity becomes ever more obscure the longer one ponders over it, for it is based on equivocation. The typical Romanticist never defines his terms, and follows an involved order of ideas that eventually throws not only the reader but himself also off the track, and leaves him free to prove whatever he wants to prove. He writes not to illuminate the subject but to intoxicate himself, and to convince himself that what his heart longs for is really so. The obscurity of Romanticism is nothing but the self-de- ception (mensonge d soi-meme) which we have already found to be charac- teristic of religion. But why blame the Romanticist? He is a man whose means of stimula- tion has been taken away by the disintegration of religious dogma, and who is frantically seeking a substitute. When religious faith collapses, some people take to drink, others take to Romanticism; there can be no doubt which is the less harmful. (3) Final Definition of Religion; The Future of Religion21 The question may be raised whether romanticism and similar movements are not more than substitutes for religion; whether, since they perform the same stimulating function as religion, they may not be called religions-and so one might speak of some one of them as the religion of the future. This, observed Janet, is purely a question of definition. If you consider it wise to stretch the term religion to cover far 21It is worth noting that for Janet the question of the future of "re- ligion" is not the same as the question of the future of the great organized religions. Since Egyptian religion, he says, there has been no real religion. Christianity and other so-called "universal religions" are not religions, properly speaking. In them, the influence of ethical and logical criticism is already far-reaching. Would Janet say that certain elements in them may survive the death of religion? 46 HORTON</page><page sequence="32">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 47 more than its traditional territory-as H6ffding does when he identifies religion with all conduct which tends to the conserva- tion of values22-you may do so. Any psychological term like "association" may be taken in such a general sense that it covers the whole field of psychology; but is it wise so to take it? Is it not better to take it in some specific sense? Perhaps if we begin with a general definition of the religious function, and then proceed to specify the characteristic way in which religion performs that function we shall be in a position to judge between the merits of general and specific definitions. There can be no doubt about the function which religion performs; it is that of stimulation (excitation).23 In less technical terms, religion satisfies the need for more abundant life (vivre plus et vivre mieux); but as we have seen, the source of all that enriches life lies in the psychological reserves. The maternal instinct, the instinct for approbation, etc., are all treasuries which are refilled as often as we empty them; the problem of richness of life is the problem how best to stimulate these instincts and spend the re- sulting strength. One may, therefore, say, if one wishes, that religion is all that stimulates the instincts and so heightens the powers. But this definition is obviously too broad. Religion belongs to the class of stimulants, but are all stimulants religious? Alcohol, danger, and love are all stimulants, and they produce phenomena psychologically iden- tical with certain religious phenomena. A young American woman sub- ject to chronic mental depression related to Janet how her first glass of whiskey raised her from doubt and fear to faith and courage-in terms strongly suggestive of religious experience. Is whiskey a god, then? No, obviously not; there has been a process of selection going on in the history of mankind, whereby certain stimulants have been recognized as inferior to others on account of their harmful after-effects; religion belongs among the superior stimulants. We can go farther and say precisely to what specific class of stimulants it belongs: social stimulants. Durkheim is perfectly right in calling religion a social phenomenon, and if we follow him and make religion the cult of social stimulation, we shall not be far from the truth. The need for direction and inspiration through friendship, as we have seen, is the fundamental need which religion satisfies. There was a period-the period of rite and myth-when society itself, through the commands of the chiefs and the social intoxication of communal rites, supplied these needs. But religion proper is something still more specific: stimulation through alliance and friendship with unseen spirits. It evolves out of the worship of society which Durkheim describes, and may still be classified as a form of social stimulation, for the relation between the worshipper and his god are thoroughly social relations; but it does not arise till the belief in unseen spirits arises, and it perishes with that belief. 2Query: has Janet quite accurately caught H6ffding's idea? 23In his University of London lectures, already cited, Janet defines excitation more exactly than he did in these lectures. It implies a process which not merely draws upon the reserve forces, but heightens the mental tension as well, raising one to a high moral level characterized by "des phenomMnes d'adaptation et de calme," a level at which complex moral acts become easy. It is at such moments, he says, that "the new memories and new habits are formed which become points of departure for new [and higher?] tendencies" (loc. cit., 222). A very high estimate of the import- ance of religion and other "stimulants" is here implied.</page><page sequence="33">HORTON For a hundred centuries, perhaps, men have literally lived upon the little psychological discovery that the energies can be mightily heightened by communion with ideal imaginary beings. Morality, logic, philosophy, and science have been the fruit of it. But the children of religion have become conscious of two vital inconveniences in her. In the first place, she is imperial- istic. To feel that one has omnipotent allies is to become over- bearing, intolerant, and oppressive. In the second place, she is prone to self-deception. A certain naivete is required to perform the fundamental religious act of prayer, and this naivete has been rendered increasingly rare since the Middle Ages by the ravages of logic and science. Shall we then predict the rapid disappearance of religion? Not at all. "Tout commence et rien ne meurt parmi les hommes." Not all men have risen to the level where religion is no longer natural to them; and for such men religion, now pruned of many of its defects by long-continued criticism, may continue to be a blessing. Children all pass through a religious stage; and all of us are apt to be seized by neurasthenia and sink back to the religious level. Do not rail at the aged philosopher who turns to religion as his mental faculties decay, and who calls in a priest to comfort his last hours; he is doing a perfectly natural and inevitable thing. But for the strong? and the disillusioned? We need not worry about them. There are all sorts of stimulants that can take the place of religion, and humanity always discovers them when it needs them. One little-noticed substitute for religion is destined to do perhaps more than all others to put religion out of style: scientific psychotherapy, which studies and remedies scientifically those states of mental depression for which religion is the sovereign but imperfect popular remedy. People who are mentally well do not need religion, and, as one may observe for oneself, they are usually not religious. A second substitute for religion that is increasingly coming in among scientists is the worship of progress. The idea of progress was hardly known in the world before the illusions of the year Iooo A.D. were dis- sipated; but now it is becoming central in men's minds, bring- ing with it the ideas of creativity and novelty, and stimulating new types of sentiment and conduct, such as toleration, respect for the liberties of others, cultivation of individual initiative, and admiration for inventors. The central maxim of this new cult may be stated in the words of Guyau, whom Janet acknowl- edged in closing to have been the chief influence in his own religious thinking: "to be confident in ourselves and in the world." 48</page><page sequence="34">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 49 CONCLUSION A. C. McGiffert is wont to express the opinion that in the history of religious thought the most important contributions have been made not by the men who have settled problems, but by the men who have raised problems. From this point of view, Janet deserves to be awarded a croix de guerre by those of us who are interested in the progress of religious thought; for he has raised enough problems to keep us busy for some little time. I do not intend to enumerate and neatly solve them forthwith;24 this is an exposition, not a polemic, and is long enough already. Besides, it is good for our souls to let such pungent criticisms as Janet's strike in and rankle awhile. The habit of presenting the arguments of an opponent only in combination with nullifying objections is deadening to thought. I merely wish, in closing, to set the reflective processes of the reader in motion-supposing they are not already under way- by setting up a few interrogation points, and pointing out some of the significant contributions which Janet has made to the philosophy of religion. I should like, in the first place, to raise a query with regard to Janet's account of the relation of the philosophic interest to the religious interest. He remarks, quite rightly, that the "God" of philosophy, being a mere explanatory principle, is useless as an object of religious worship; but he is mistaken, I think, when he infers from this that the explanatory motive is foreign to the religious motive. The instinctive basis of religion is complex; and McDougall is right, I believe, in including curiosity among the instincts which go to make up the religious sentiment. Leuba has shown that the explanatory motive is one of the factors which combine to produce the god-idea. The "high gods" of certain African tribes have no other function than that of explain- ing the origin of creation; later in the evolution of religion, as the need for organizing the thought-world appears, the creator-gods come to coalesce with the more utilitarian gods who preside over war and agriculture and the common affairs of life.26 Hence any conception of the divine which is to satisfy the religious interest must also satisfy the philosophical interest; a petit dieu d notre usage (such as Wells' God) will eventually prove as unsatisfactory to our religious cravings as a remote Creator-God who takes no interest in us, for he is nearly as much at the mercy of the cosmic forces 24Thus for example, I shall not even raise the question of the validity of the behavioristic psychology as a final, metaphysical account of per- sonality, although I am convinced of its inadequacy, and feel that much of Janet's argument would lose its force if his behavioristic presuppositions were criticized. I leave that critique to more competent psychologists. It is true that in his articles in the British Journal of Psychology Janet asserts that he does not claim metaphysical validity for his psychology; but my impression was that in his course at the Collge de France, in spite of half- ironical disclaimers, he was really venturing into the field of metaphysics. 2See also G. Belot, Note sur la triple origine de l'id6e de Dieu, Rev. de Met. et de Morale, 16, I908, 717ff.</page><page sequence="35">HORTON as we are. The problem of the place of man in Nature is both a philosoph- ical and a religious problem; and the question of the possible existence of a higher mind than ours in control, or partial control, of cosmic evolu- tion is not so irrelevant to the religious question as Janet would have us believe. Again Janet remarks that philosophy and science, in so far as they are analytic mental processes, tend to destroy religion, which is a synthetic mental activity. He infers that as the rational mental level, where analysis arises, is higher than the level where religion arises, religion is destined to disappear in the natural course of mental evolution-surviving only in children and neurotics. But, if this be true, humanity has a dark future indeed; for religion is not the only synthetic mental activity that is destined to disappear. The appreciation of poetry, painting, music, and the beauties of nature, as well as the appreciation of moral grandeur in other human personalities, and the pursuit of ideal perfection in our own,-all this, too, is destined to vanish, for all active, appreciative and enthusiastic moods are apt to be stricken-through and killed by the dissecting-knife of analysis. It cannot be denied that in certain scientists and philosophers some such soul- withering process seems to have taken place; but ought one to call such abnormal individuals the highest products of mental evolution? Is not the continual predominance of the analytic mood, with the aboulia which tends to result from it, a definitely psychopathic state? Think of such a man as Benjamin Constant, an abject failure as a moral personality, but a brilliant success as a critical intelligence, writing a successful psychological novel in which his own moral turpitude is laid bare! I do not mean to imitate Bergson in disparaging the intellect and regarding its appearance in evolution as a cosmic blunder; I simply mean to suggest that in the highest type of intelligence there should be a healthy alternation between straightforward activity and critical analysis. Religion belongs to the same class as vital processes like nutrition and literary self-expression. Analysis may and should be employed to guide these processes; but should it be permitted to destroy them? Another query: is the religious state of mind, to use L6vy- Bruhl's expression, "impervious to experience?" Is it fitly represented by Janet's case of the woman who persisted in believing her head had been amputated, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding? I think it is true that religious dogmas tend to be modified by exper- ience much more slowly than the practical arts and physical sciences, and that, consequently, our views of the ultimate nature of things stand more in need of revision; but I think that this is largely because the cosmic environment "hits back at us" much less forcibly and regularly than our immediate physical environment. I am convinced that the history of religion shows many cases of the modification of theological hypotheses under stress of circumstances. For example, the Hebrew prophets used their conception of the divine moral order as a means of predicting future historical events-unsuccessfully, in many instances. When failure came, they sometimes rationalized it to fit in with their previous dogmas, quite like Levy-Bruhl's savages; but not always. Sometimes they gave up the dogma and framed a new one-notably in the case of the dogma that suffering is a divine punishment indicating guilt on the part of the sufferer. I cannot escape the conclusion that in the course of this slow and halting process of theological reconstruction a genuine approach to 50</page><page sequence="36">ORIGIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION 51 the truth about the cosmic conditions of human life has been taking place, and that religious symbols like the idea of God consequently have a cosmic as well as a human significance. A final query: is religion only for the weak, or chiefly for the weak? Such is Janet's conclusion; but is it a wholly consistent conclusion from the facts as he himself sets them forth? If the reader will consider the diverse effects of mental stimulation, I think he will agree that a permanent or protracted raising of the level is prob- ably indicative of a strong or "rich" individual, while sharp reaction and permanent depression following stimulation is probably indicative of a weak or "poor" individual. Is not the conclusion obvious? Religion or any strong stimulant may be positively dangerous for a neurasthenic individual; his friends must guard him against revival meetings as they guard him against alcohol and drugs.26 It is the strong individual, who is tempted to drowse along and do less than he is able, who most needs religion. What happens when such an individual-a Wesley or a Luther-"gets religion" is written large across the face of history. He generates a wave of energy that galvanizes whole masses of men and seems to persist for centuries. If religion can produce such results without stultifying the intelligence, and if the energy it generates can be diverted into the right channels by a simulta- neous sharpening of the moral sensibilities, then, in the name of Humanity and Progress, why not have more religion! Let us have scientific psycho- therapy too, and anything that will help tone us up for the task that faces us; but in my judgment, any one who, having no insuperable intellectual obstacles in his way, and having not yet exerted himself to the verge of exhaustion, rejects religion or any other wholesome stimulant because he feels no need of it, has a poor conception of the load of moral responsibility that rests upon every human individual in a time like this. But it is after all one of the functions of religion to create the vision of duty which makes one conscious of the need of inspiration. It is one of the merits of Janet's conception of religion-and here I touch upon what seems to me to be his most significant contribution to the philosophy of religion- that it ascribes to religion not only a stimulative but also a directive function, and shows the vital unity of the two func- tions: the gods, according to his theory, conserve human energy by satisfying the human need for direction or guidance. This, it seems to me, is a much juster view of the function of religion than that of certain sociologists who regard religion purely as a stimulant. T. N. Carver, for example, once remarked in a lecture that the function of religion in the state was like that of a brass band in a regiment: it invigorates but must not presume to lead. Similarly, Giddings once defined religion as "all that stimulates the will to carry on." It seems to me that Janet's definition of religion describes the facts much more adequately than those of either Carver, Giddings, or Durkheim, while at the same time recogniz- ing the relative truth of such broader definitions. All four would agree on the function that differentiates the genus; but none of them marks off the 6I do not mean to say that religion can do nothing for the neuras- thenic; on the contrary, the Emmanuel Movement has proved that the skilful minister may make a distinct contribution to psychiatry. Besides, the patient's need is for something more than physical and mental health. There is still a place for the "cure of souls".</page><page sequence="37">species so exactly as Janet, or notes so clearly that when we get into the sphere of social stimulants a new function, the directive function, comes into play. Perhaps it would be well to point out that religion as Janet defines it never occurs, historically, in an isolated state. It always occurs in- extricably mingled with other stimulants. The inspiring influence of the religious group upon the religious individual is almost as important as that of the god himself, and it is not surprising that Durkheim should have considered it the chief thing in religion. Moreover, even after the rejection of grosser stimulants like alcohol, religion has always continued to use certain stimulants, like music and rhythmic motion. Even the best of these stimulants of the outer sphere inspire without directing; but if they are employed in the service of a religion whose god-idea is moral, they may become an integral part of that religion, and take their direction from it. I have only one modification to suggest in Janet's admirable definition of religion: the species "religion" within the larger species "social stimulant" should be so differentiated as to indicate the role which the speculative interest has played in religion. The gods-to repeat Leuba's contention-grew in part out of the desire to explain creation; and a large part of the stimulating effect of communion with them is due to the belief that they control the universe. To guide, to inspire, and to protect are their most prominent functions; and the third is not the least important. Whether there is any evidence for protection is another matter; many earnest thinkers assure us there is not; but religion is vitally interested in the question, and will not let it drop until it is definitely decided in the affirma- tive or the negative, or until the boundaries between a legiti- mate and an illegitimate faith in Providence are definitely settled-which means that discussion is bound to continue for some time yet. Meanwhile we are greatly indebted to Janet for the whole of his spirited analysis, and in particular for his original theories on the origin and function of religion. The "duplicity" theory of the origin of belief in spirits should excite much discussion. The analysis of religious faith is particularly subtle; no religious person can read the comparison of religious and philosophical discussion without crying "Peccavi!" Doubtless the present exposition of Janet's views has been unconsciously colored by the religious leanings of the writer; but he would be deeply chagrined to discover that it was so, for he cherishes the hope that a genuine working partnership may some day be established between religion, science, and philosophy. 52 HORTON</page></plain_text>
