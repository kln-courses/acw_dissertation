<plain_text><page sequence="1">MUTATIONS OF THE SUPERNATURAL: WITCHCRAFT, REMARKABLE PROVIDENCES, AND THE POWER OF PURITAN MEN ANN KIBBEY Yale University ON APRIL 19,1962, MARY WARREN APPEARED BEFORE THE COURT CONVENED to try suspected witches at Salem. Having testified initially as a victim of witchcraft, the twenty-year-old woman now stood accused of it herself. After altering her plea several times over a period of several weeks, she finally confessed she had signed the "Devil's Book." Strangely, this yield- ing to Satan did not damage Warren's credibility as a star witness for the court. Self-confessed witch though she was, the court continued to take depositions from her and she continued to be "afflicted," paradoxically performing the legal roles of accuser and accused simultaneously. War- ren's capacity to be at once both agent and victim of the devil's power was only a particular instance of her capacity to offer contradictory views of witchcraft, for she was just as inconsistent when she ventured into non- religious explanations. When it was deposed that she had accused her peers of fraud, that "she the Said Mary said that the afflicted girls did but dissemble," Warren paradoxically responded by falling into a "fit" her- self. She continued to experience numerous other seizures during her testimony, despite her own assessment of fraud. Warren also resorted to the belief that the afflicted were merely insane, that "the Majestrates Might as well Examine Keysars Daughter that has Bin Distracted Many Yeares And Take Noatice of what Shee said: as well as any of the Afflicted pe'sons. " Presumably she included herself in this repudiation, for some of her fellow prisoners testified that Mary was well aware of her own self- contradiction, that she had explained to them in the jail: When I was Afflicted I thought I saw the Apparission of A hundred persons: for Shee said hir Head was Distempered [so] that Shee Could not tell what Shee Said, And the Said Mary tould us that when Shee was well Againe Shee Could not Say that Shee saw any of [the] Apparissions at the time Aforesaid. Nonetheless, Warren was never so self-disparaging or skeptical in court.</page><page sequence="2">126 American Quarterly Before the judges, she agreeably testified at length of "apparissions" who had appeared to her and threatened her.' More than any other witness, Mary Warren appears to be a totally unreliable source on the Salem witchcraft trials, someone who did not even understand herself, much less anyone else. Yet her case record is unusually interesting because, ironically, in her mental wanderings she managed to delineate the whole range of interpretations that historians have since offered to explain the Salem afflicted. From the earliest, Robert Calef's charge of fraud in 1697, through Chadwick Hansen's 1969 analysis of hysteria (coupled with his belief in "real witches"), to Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum's recent assertion that the behavior of the "afflicted girls" is interpretively insignificant-Mary Warren had already suggested these conflicting possibilities, albeit not in such finished form.2 Pleading both innocence and guilt, both insane hallucinations and belief in witches and, as it were, both fraud and fits, Warren was admirably comprehensive in her incoherence . Perhaps, then, this servant woman's nonsense was also unwitting insight. Although Warren seems nearly unintelligible as an individual subject, she makes much more sense from a cultural perspective. Her sense of interchangeable, opposing views was tacitly corroborated by the reversal of legal opinion in 1711, when the legislature formally exonerated most of those who had been convicted in 1692. Declaring these defendants inno- cent, official authority then changed sides itself, blaming "the Influence and Energy of the Evil Spirits so great at that time acting in and upon those who were the principal accusers and Witnesses proceeding so far as to cause a Prosecution to be had of persons of known and good reputation."3 The dualist opposition between divine power and witchcraft seems to have been much more fragile, much more vulnerable to reversal, than the oc- currence of the trials and executions might otherwise suggest. Even before 1692, there was obvious evidence of deep confusion about the nature of supernatural influence in Increase Mather's Essay for the Recording of 'Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum, eds., The Salem Witchcraft Papers: Verbatim Transcripts of the Legal Documents of the Salem Witchcraft Outbreak of 1692, 3 vols.

Starkey, The Devil in Massachusetts (New York: Knopf, 1949), tends to follow Calef. Modem historians share Warren's credulity as well as her incredulity. Chadwick Hansen, Witchcraft at Salem (New York: Braziller, 1969), analyzes the "afflicted" in terms of Freud's studies of hysteria and anthropological studies of voodoo, concluding that "at least two of the persons still attainted as witches under Massachusetts law-Bridget Bishop and Mammy Redd- actually were witches" (219). In the most recent study of Salem, Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum, Salem Possessed: The Social Origins of Witchcraft (1974; rpt. Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1977), the authors explain, "Oddly enough, it has been through our sense of 'collaborating' with [the Salem minister] Parris and [the main family of accusers] the Putnams in their effort to delineate the larger contours of their world, and our sympathy, at least on the level of metaphor, with certain of their perceptions, that we have come to feel a curious bond with the 'witch hunters' of 1692" (180). 3 "Reversal of Attainder, October 17, 171 1," in Boyer and Nissenbaum, Witchcraft Papers, 1015-156 (italics added). A few attainders were not reversed.</page><page sequence="3">Mutations of the Supernatural 127 Illustrious Providences (1684). Mather, a Boston minister and politician, had collected narratives from his fellow colonists to demonstrate that, despite the Indian wars and loss of the colony's original charter, the deity had consistently singled out New Englanders for special benevolence. However, this collection of "remarkable and very memorable events" in New England included not only the narratives of providences, but also numerous accounts of sorcery, apparitions, demonic possession, magic, and witchcraft-many of them culled from English collections. In short, Mather included every form of supernatural power he knew of, good or evil, and inexplicably offered them all under one cover as the "illustrious providences" of the Puritan deity. Moreover, many providences of the divinity were more bizarre and horrifying than clearly benevolent: among the more impressive close calls, people survived being captured by In- dians, burned by gunpowder, shot in the head, struck by lightning, and having houses fall down on them. Even in the 1690s Mather's book was viewed by some as an irresponsible incitement to the Salem tragedy, mainly because he had introduced a wealth of occult tales to the American Puritan imagination and lent his prestige to their circulation. In retrospect, however, it seems equally significant that Mather implicitly attributed occult power and apparently hostile acts to the Puritan deity as well as to the witch. Mather's editing seems just as fickle as Warren's testimony, and from a close perspective, just as idiosyncratic. Warren's testimony, Mather's book, the reversal of legal opinion- taken singly, each appears to be an atypical moment of emotional in- dulgence. Taken together, they begin to imply that a confusing similarity between divine and occult power was actually characteristic of Puritan thought. Indeed, if we step back from the immediacy of the Salem witch- craft decade, and take a secular view of Puritan beliefs about supernatural power as they developed in the seventeenth century, the confusion sur- rounding Salem looks very different. From this broader perspective, the stark, dualist opposition between divine power and witchcraft appears to have been superimposed over a chronic similarity in the acts attributed to the deity and the witch. As I will show, the Puritan concept of divine power, particularly among American Puritans, developed in part by appropriating the powers attributed to sorcerers and witches in pre-Reformation Europe. Beginning in the late 1500s the Puritan deity steadily acquired these pow- ers, so much so that the power of the medieval wicche came to characterize divine power. The startling resemblance between the Puritan deity and the witch has been obscured by considerable misunderstanding in our own century about the history of witchcraft beliefs. Although the diabolic image of the witch has long been presumed to be as old as Christianity itself, historians have recently proved this to be false. Actually, belief in the diabolic witch developed on the Continent sometime in the fifteenth century, when the Church's attack on magicians and heretics was expanded to include witches per se. Christian society concomitantly began to believe that most</page><page sequence="4">128 American Quarterly witches were women, despite the fact that it continued to accuse and convict significant numbers of men. (At Salem, about one-third of the accused, and one-third of those tried and convicted, were men.) Adapting already existing beliefs about magicians and heretical sects, and further incorporating symbolic images of women and reports of pagan religious practices among women, Continental clerics and lawyers of early modern Europe produced a synthetic nightmare of powerful, dangerous, numer- ous, and distinctly female witches who paid homage to Satan and threat- ened all of society. At the height of prosecution in Europe, roughly 1550- 1650, this new diabolic, sexualized image of the witch was a staple of Continental trials. People were convicted as much-or more-for spiritual and sexual relations with the devil as for any particular harm to their neighbors.4 The typical emphasis placed on the symbolic female witch has done more than just distort the chronology of witchcraft beliefs. It has also made it easy to overlook the significance of the most obvious fact of witchcraft prosecution: that men were responsible for the public articulation of the concept of the symbolic witch and for the social fact of widespread prose- cution and execution. While many women also believed in witches, the court authorities who initiated and conducted the prosecutions were men; they were sanctioned by laws created by men, defended in tracts written by men, and their court convictions led to executions conducted by men. Nonetheless, men have been a neglected subject in analyses of witchcraft prosecutions, hidden from history (as perhaps they wished to be) by the impressive diabolic witch. Even Boyer and Nissenbaum, whose study of Salem has done much to correct the imbalance, fall back at crucial points on conventional symbolic images of female witches to explain the dynamics of specific charges.5 Furthermore, while they describe at length the jealous- 4Severe problems with chronology were first noted by Charles Edward Hopkin, The Share of Thomas Aquinas in the Growth of the Witchcraft Delusion (Philadelphia: Univ. of Penn- sylvania Press, 1940), 174-84, but the forgeries were not exposed until Norman Cohn, Europe's Inner Demons: An Enquiry Inspired by the Great Witch-hunt (New York: Basic Books, 1975). Cf. Richard Keickhefer, European Witch Trials: Their Foundation in Popular and Learned Culture, 1300-1500 (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1976), who indepen- dently confirms Cohn; and Edward Peters, The Magician, the Witch, and the Law (Philadel- phia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1978). Cohn, Keickhefer, and Peters agree that pre- Reformation trials were overwhelmingly concerned with magic and heresy, not witchcraft, and that massive witch-hunts were a phenomenon of early modern Europe.

The purpose of this essay is to explore the social as well as the religious significance of the concept of witchcraft in the thought of Puritan men. As Alan MacFarlane and Keith Thomas have shown, witchcraft accusa- tions in the courts of Elizabethan and Stuart England differed significantly from the accusations of diabolism that inundated Continental courts in early modern Europe. Although Englishmen shared the new Continental predilection for prosecuting women, they were preoccupied with witch- craft as a material, much more than a spiritual crime. Despite the warnings of a few English authors (such as William Perkins) who shared the Conti- nental terror of diabolic compacts and devil-worship, English judges and accusers rarely gave their attention to Sabbats, covens, or pacts with the devil. According to MacFarlane's analysis of Essex prosecutions, ninety- two percent of witchcraft charges in Assize Court indictments were for injuring or killing people or livestock, or damaging property. While Conti- nental indictments included these crimes, they were typically interwoven with the more volatile charge of heretical devil-worship. By contrast, English courts prosecuted witches in small numbers and principally for deeds that intervened in the material world of the ordinary person's life in a direct and obvious way. How the witch acquired her power was not very important to the magistrates. Instead, they sought proof of malice and tangible harm. The relation between the individual witch's own hostility and the victim's material misfortune was the focus of the trial.6 By concentrating almost exclusively on material crimes and the motive of malice, the English courts clearly maintained an older image of the witch's powers, one found in European sources antedating the concept of the diabolic witch. Medieval authors indentified the witch by his or her capacity and desire to perform maleficia. Maleficium originally meant "an evil deed or mischief," but from the fourth century on, it appeared in official documents meaning "harm-doing by occult means." Maleficia were ascribed to witches and sorcerers alike, and authors writing in English or French similarly made no distinction between witchcraft and sorcery. The Old English wicca, the etymological root of "witch," simply meant a man who practiced magic and divination. The Old French equivalent was sorcier. Not all harm-doing was ascribed to magic, and certainly magic had a broad range of common uses, many of them benevolent. Maleficium denoted only one kind of deed within a wide range of occult possibilities, and certain adversities were believed to be especially typical maleficia: natural disasters such as storms and fires that damaged grain, livestock, or 6American historiography assumes, erroneously, that Perkins was representative of English thought.

Unlike the later image of the diabolic witch, the concept of maleficium drew attention to a concrete event and its effect (harmful), the supposed means (preternatural, but not diabolic), and the implied motive (malice), but it did not stereotype the characteristics of the person who did it. Anyone with malicious intent and occult knowledge was capable of maleficium, and terminology suggests that both men and women were believed to be culpable. The agents of these evil deeds were called, in Latin, maleficuslmalefica; in Old English, wiccalwicce; and in Old French, sorcierlsorciere. The Middle English wicche was used for both men and women and so, initially, was the modern English "witch."7 It was the medieval sorcerer-witch, not the later diabolic witch, that the Puritan deity came to resemble. Drawing on the general credence of maleficia, Puritans imagined a deity who performed the same deeds as the medieval wicche, intervening in the natural course of events in the same ways. Of course the Puritans gave these supernatural acts a different name and a different motive, variously calling them "afflictions," "remarkable providences," and "memorable deliverances." However adverse events seemed to be, when Puritans believed them to be special acts of their divinity, they reinterpreted the motive as the correcting hand of divine love, the deity's edifying intervention meant to instruct erring souls and provoke repentance. In retrospect, what really seems remarkable about "remarkable providences" was the capacity of Puritan imaginations to transform bad fortune into good fortune. Mather indirectly conceded as much in his Essay, concluding his "philosophical meditations" with an anecdote in which "a prophane man" contrasts his own, non-Puritan view of misfortune with the Puritan belief in divine benevolence. A faithless man who "greatly trembled" when it "thundered very dreadfully," the "prophane man" was astonished when his pious wife was "not at all afraid." Impressed by her fearlessness, he inquired why she was so calm and was "amazed" at her reply: "I know it is the voice of my Heavenly Father: and should a child be afraid to hear his fathers voice?" The husband concluded, "these Puritans have a divine principle in them, which the world seeth not, that they should have peace and security in their souls when others are filled with dismal fears and horrors."8 The thunderstorm that occasioned this man's insight into Puritan religion was also one of the oldest and most common maleficia in the repertoire of medieval witches and sorcerers, even something of a specialty.

According to Cohn, legal records imply that sorcerers regularly threatened people with the ruination of their crops by storms, and the writings of a ninth-century bishop of Lyons indicate that "almost everybody-nobleman and com- moner, town dweller and peasant-believed in the supernatural power of storm-makers." Among his examples, Cohn describes a sorceress ar- raigned in London in 1493, who "freely boasted that she could make it rain at will."9 As Mather's tale suggests, among his adherents the Puritan deity was also a noted tempestarius, and New England narrators seem to have been especially impressed with their deity's capacity and inclination to "make it rain at will." They praised their deity's weather-magic, believing such afflictions expressed divine approval of the colonists' immigration. For example, Edward Johnson saw the power of the divinity in a storm of 1634 which nearly capsized an embarking ship with two noted preachers on board, John Norton and Thomas Shepard. Barely escaping arrest in Yar- mouth, they had set sail only to find the ship driven back to the English coast by a storm causing "the losse of the Ships upper worke." This adversity might easily have been construed as divine disapproval of their journey, but Johnson nevertheless interpreted the event as a show of benevolence: "The Lord Christ intending to make his New England soul- diers the very wonder of this Age, brought them into greater straites, that this Wonder-working Providence might the more appeare in their deliver- ance. " Johnson's narration, like Mather's, shows he was well aware of the possible confusion of maleficia and remarkable providences. As Johnson tells it, the ship captain and the sailors had their own ideas about who caused the storm, believing it to be the malice of witchcraft: "The Master, and other Sea men made a strange construction of the sore storme they met withall, saying, their Ship was bewitched." But Johnson was certain the sailors were wrong, that "assuredly it was the Lord Christ, who hath command both of Winds and Seas" who had caused the storm to "have his people know he hath delivered, and will deliver [them] from so great a death. " 10 Shepard and Norton finally succeeded in their intentions, but other Puritans experienced more convoluted and painful forms of divine caring. Anthony Thacher recounted a "remarkable sea deliverance" occurring in 1635 on a voyage from Ipswich to Marblehead. On this short but disastrous trip, Thacher, his cousin, Peter Avery, and their families also experienced the power of the Puritan deity as storm-maker: "Before daylight it pleased the Lord to send so mighty a storm, as the like was never known in New England since the English came, nor in the memory of any Indians." Despite the fact that the families were making the trip for a holy purpose (Peter had been called to the ministry at Marblehead), the boat capsized in 9Cohn, Europe's Inner Demons, 152-53. I'Edward Johnson, Wonder-Working Providence of Sions Saviour in New England (Lon- don, 1654), ch. 29.</page><page sequence="8">132 American Quarterly the storm. Floundering in the sea, the sinking Thacher prayed to the divine storm-maker and found himself enabled to walk in, if not on, water: "I lifted up both my heart and hands to the God of heaven. For note, I had my senses remaining perfect with me all the time that I was under and in water, who at that instant lifted up my head above the top of the water, that so I might breathe without any hindrance by the waters. I stood bolt upright as if I had stood upon my feet, but I felt no bottom, nor had any footing to stand upon, but the waters." The deity was benevolent, but not very-only Thacher and his wife survived this remarkable providence. After watching Avery's entire family and his own five children drown, himself unable to rescue any of them, Thacher was finally cast up on a "desolate island" where "I and my wife were almost naked both of us, and wet and cold even unto death." Grostesquely, he emphasized that the deity did not fail to provide for them in their grief and deprivation, for Thacher found his dead son's coat washed up on the beach, along with some water-logged supplies: "Going further I found a drowned goat, then I found a hat, and my son William's coat, both which I put on . . . . Thus the Lord sent us some clothes to put on, and food to sustain our new lives which we had lately given to us." For a devout Puritan, even the most anguished misfortunes were construed as acts of divine benevolence. When Mather reprinted this narrative in Illustrious Providences, he tried to smooth away the incon- gruity of benevolent disaster by not mentioning who had died, introducing the story as "Mr. Anthony Thacher's relation concerning his and his wife's being marvellously preserved alive, when all the ship's company perished." Unlike Johnson, neither Thacher nor Mather mentioned any possibility of sorcery. For them, perhaps, the deity was fully credible as benevolent only if there were no alternatives broached.11 Unlike the medieval tempestarii, the Puritan deity was rarely accused of damage to crops, at least not in the annals of early historians and jour- nalists. Nevertheless, the old notion was still influential, for in 1646 Win- throp recorded that a supernatural power had contrived a "thunder shower" of caterpillars to destroy their crops: Great harm was done in corn (especially wheat and barley) in this month by a caterpillar, like a black worm about an inch and a half long.. . . It was believed by divers good observers, that they fell in a great thunder shower, for divers yards and other bare places, where not one of them was to be seen an hour before, were presently after the shower almost covered with them.12 The analogy of a biblical plague might have been more ready-to-hand, but Winthrop and his fellow Puritans were probably inspired instead by the ""Thacher's Narrative of His Shipwreck," in Alexander Young, ed., Chronicles of the First Planters of the Colony of Massachussets Bay, From 1623 to 1636 (Boston: Little and Brown, 1846), 483-95; Increase Mather, An Essay for the Recording of Illustrious Provi- dences, (Boston, 1684), 1. 12"Journal," July 1646, quoted in Perry Miller and Thomas E. Johnson, eds., The Puritans (New York: Harper and Row, 1963), I, 141.</page><page sequence="9">Mutations of the Supernatural 133 tradition of storm-makers' sorcery. The Puritans counteracted with their prayers to the deity, and the caterpillars departed. Witches were also believed to kill livestock as well as crops. Cohn cites an eleventh-century source referring to people "who actually boasted that they could remove or kill chickens, young peacocks, whole litters of piglets, by a word or glance." 13 Less prominent in Puritan thought, this maleficium neverthe- less hovered in the background of Puritan sermons and narratives, as in Thacher's unwitting rhyme of "drowned goat" and "William's coat," associating the deaths of children and livestock, or John Cotton's sermon describing the effects of the deity's curse: "A man that doth despise the patience and bounty of God, hee doth pro-cure to himselfe speciall, rare, choyse, and extraordinary wrath and judgement, not onely one or two, but variety, choise and store, upon body, soule, and conscience, upon children and estate left behinde."14 Personal harm sounds more foreboding here, but the destruction of livestock as a portion of the targeted estate was well within the domain of providential "variety" that a sinner could expect. The witch or sorcerer might also destroy property by fire, as Richard Rosse of Little Clapton, Essex, knew. In 1582, when his barn mysteriously caught fire, he accused Henry Celles of witchcraft. 15 Similarly, the divinity was an occasional incendiary. Although the deity did not often indulge in this maleficium, the insightful Increase Mather readily recognized the divine power behind the great Boston fire of 171 1, rushing into print with Burnings Bewailed ... In which the Sins which Provoke the Lord to Kindle Fires are Enquired into. When Samuel Sewall's house caught fire in 1709, he also discerned the hand of Providence, although he claimed he was too slow- witted to understand the divinity's edifying message about his sins: "The good Lord sanctify this Threatening; and his Parental Pity in improving ourselves for the Discovery of the fire, and Quenching it. The Lord teach me what I know not; and wherein I have done amiss help me to do so no more!"16 Although theologically the divinity was not limited to any particular means or ends, in their daily lives the Puritans applied the criteria of maleficia to identify the special providences of their deity. Colonial narra- tives yield many more examples like the illustrations I have given above. They are equally numerous in the writings of clerics and laymen, and indeed it is difficult to find a colonial narrative that does not employ this concept of the deity. Strange as it seems, what for centuries had been the evil deeds of witches and sorcerers became, for American Puritans, the benevolent signs of divine love. Whether this was also true for other Protestant sects is difficult to assess, since studies of European witchcraft 13Cohn, Europe's Inner Demons, 152. 14John Cotton, God's Mercie Mixed With His Justice (London, 1641), 17-18.

Halsey Thomas (New York: Farrer, Straus, and Giroux, 1973), 621-22.</page><page sequence="10">134 American Quarterly do not address this question. What evidence can be gleaned from existing interpretations strongly suggests, however, that the Puritans were by no means unique. In Thomas's study of beliefs about supernatural power in early modern England, the chapter on providences and the chapter on witchcraft describe very similar kinds of events. In his detailed study of Essex for the same period, MacFarlane concludes in perplexity, "Yet, as a method of explaining misfortune and evil, witchcraft beliefs to some extent overlapped with religious explanations," and adds further that "the differ- ence between the Puritans and those they castigated was merely in the details. " MacFarlane makes nothing of this, but his own evidence indicates that the "details" were crucial to contemporary writers because the "over- lap" was very substantial. The minister George Gifford complained that his congregation constantly confused the deity with the witch: "They can by no means see, that God is provoked by their sinnes to give the devill such instruments to work withall, but rage against the witch." Reginald Scot likewise viewed witchcraft accusations as mere delusions of impious souls who could not bear to see divine power for what it really was: The fables of witchcraft have taken so fast hold and deepe root in the heart of man, that fewe or none can (nowadaies) with patience indure the hand and correction of God. For if any adversitie, greefe, sicknesse, losse of children, corne, cattell, or libertie happen to them; by &amp; by they exclaime uppon witches. As though there were no God in Israel that ordereth all things according to his will. Neither a Puritan nor a cleric, Scot nevertheless derided those Englishmen who did not yet understand Reformation religion, who mistook the Protes- tant deity's providences for maleficia. 17 In general, European authors and judges consistently suggested a signifi- cant resemblance between the power of the new Protestant deity and the traditional powers of the sorcerer-witch. Sometimes the resemblance was expressed unwittingly, as in the English account of Elizabeth Jackson's "prophesying threatenings, ever taking effect, which Judge Anderson ob- served as a notable property of a witch. 91 8The charwoman's curses were described in the same terms used for the Old Testament prophecy of Jeremiah. Moreover, Puritan ministers called their own conventicles "prophesyings." In the writings of the French political theorist, Jean Bodin, the similarity between his concepts of the deity and the witch made his argument for witchcraft prosecution nearly unintelligible. Believing that witchcraft was an "insult" to the "majesty of God," Bodin contended that witches should be executed not so much to punish malicious harmdo- 17Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic, chs. 4, 14; MacFarlane, Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England, 189, 194, cites Gifford, 194, and Scot, 192. 180n the Jackson case, see Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic, 511. On prophesy- ing, see Irvonwy Morgan, The Godly Preachers of the Elizabethan Church (Londoh: Ep- worth Press, 1965).</page><page sequence="11">Mutations of the Supernatural 135 ing as to appease the deity's wrath. He confusedly warned that those "who let the witches escape, or who do not punish them with the utmost rigor, may rest assured that they will be abandoned by God to the mercy of the witches. And the country which shall tolerate this will be scourged with pestilences, famines, and wars. " 19 But who would cause all this harm? The escaped witches, or the enraged and "insulted" deity? To judge from Bodin's reasoning, the deity and the witch were equally capable of such vengeful attacks. German Protestant theologians at Wurttemberg, far more aware of the possible confusion between the powers of the deity and the witch, argued that such confusion was itself the work of the devil. In 1613 Johann Sigwart, a Professor of Scripture at Tubingen and a follower of the Wurttemberg school, explained that the hailstorm near his city of Tubingen was not witchcraft, but that the devil had tried to make it seem so: "For when Satan . . . notices that according to nature a storm may arise, he suggests to his witches . . . to work their magic, and to cook and stir this or that together in their hail pot. " But the apparent power of maleficia was the devil's delusion, for "at the same time it thunders and hails, not because they [the witches] caused it, but because it was already about to happen without them, either by nature or at God's decree."20 Only deluded witches, Sigwart argued, could fail to see that the hailstorm was the work of an all-powerful deity. For Sigwart, as for Scot and Gifford in England, the concept of divine power as the author of disaster had become important enough to make it an act of bad faith if one believed in the witch's power to perform maleficia at all. Regardless of whether they supported or opposed the prosecution of witches, European authors searched urgently for ways to distinguish their deity as the sole perpetrator of misfortune. The ideological threat of re- semblance, not misfortune itself, was what they feared. Historians have speculated that the Protestant lack of techniques for combating witchcraft may have weakened their struggle against Catholicism, that pious prayers and counsels to endure must have seemed dangerously inadequate when compared to the battery of Catholic ritual.21 However, this hypothesis altogether misses the nature of the major threat presented by witchcraft beliefs: the Protestant deity was communicating his presence in the same way that sorcerers and witches had traditionally communicated theirs. And it misses, as well, the Protestants' real "defense" against Catholicism. We are accustomed to interpreting the Reformation as an effort to eradicate traditional beliefs in Europe, but when we consider the growth of Protes- tantism in light of traditional beliefs about witches and sorcerers, the influence seems rather to have gone the other way. Far from eliminating these older beliefs, Protestantism appropriated them for its own cause. 19Jean Bodin, De la Demonomanie des Sorciers (Paris, 1850), quoted in Alan C. Kors and Edward Peters, eds., Witchcraft in Europe 1100-1700: A Documentary History (Philadel- phia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1972), 215. 20Midelfort, Witch-hunting in Southwestern Germany, 44. 2'For a recent statement of this view, see Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic, chs, 1-9.</page><page sequence="12">136 American Quarterly The Puritan injunction to endure any affliction, any harm or misery, as a just punishment meted out by the deity was not theologically innovative. What was new was the significance afflictions received from the Puritan theory of history. Sacvan Bercovitch has shown how English Protestant- ism assigned religious significance to contemporary events by discovering, they believed, parallels between Israel's history and English history. As he explains, American Puritans tipped the balance of the analogy decisively in favor of contemporary events, producing a "wholesale inversion of tradi- tional hermeneutics" that "transferred the source of meaning from Scrip- ture to secular history.' '22 Restricting the relevance of Israel's history to themselves alone, American Puritans treated the events of their own lives as types prophecying the millenial, definitive revelation that would vindi- cate their interpretation of their own importance in the world. It was not that pre-Reformation Christians had never read the book of nature, but they had never read it in this way. While typological interpretation had been applied to the history of the Catholic Church, and while any medieval theologian would readily have agreed that history was providential, they did not read the ordinary, material events of their own lives as a divine prophecy with an unprecedented message to convey to the rest of the world. The Puritans, well aware of the novelty of their perspective (that was exactly the point), advertised it with such phrases as "remarkable providences," "wonder-working providences," and "remarkable deliver- ances" to announce the deity's interventions in the world on their behalf. Puritan hermeneutic theory claimed that significant events in Puritan lives had clear biblical equivalents, but in practice the analogy with Israel's history was difficult to discern beyond the initial emigration/exodus from England/Egypt and the crossing of the Atlantic/Red Sea. For the most part, the hermeneutics intended to reveal their own history instead tended to conceal it in suggestive biblical symbolism. Puritans made this biblical analogy credible to themselves not so much through parallels to Scriptural chronicles, but by appropriating the Old Testament prophetic jeremiad, the anxious warning of Jeremiah that an elect people must expect warning chastisements from the deity whenever they lost their sense of spiritual purpose. Unlike specific events of Israel's history, the "prophesying threatenings" of Jeremiah were extremely versatile, for the general logic maintained an abstract connection with Israel's history, while the indefi- niteness of the threat freed interpretation from the necessity to argue any particular parallels between Puritans and Israelites. Short of the whole society being utterly "consumed out of the land," any adverse events were an oblique confirmation of their elect status.23 Thus affliction became a convoluted divine sanction, however much it might appear to the uniniti- ated to be a sign of rejecting wrath. Since the deity's blessing could take 22Sacvan Bercovitch, The Puritan Origins of the American Self (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1975.)

What made an event a sign of election was the perceptible disruption per se, not the consequences of it. Destruc- tion, disease, and death, if they seemed unusual, could be just as persuasive as health and prosperity. Preternatural events, disrupting ordinary life, and expressing a personal, vengeful anger, causing harm and promising the possibility of more harm- for the Puritans these events proved to be, not surprisingly, the same ones European culture had recognized as such for centuries. Under the aegis of the jeremiad, however, the whole range of maleficia acquired anew impor- tance and a new meaning as the Puritans' means of religious self- identification. In between the biblical metaphors and public histories, and tucked away in the privacy of journals and diaries, Puritan narrators had their moments of "remarkable" clarity in which they detailed the particular storms, fires, diseases, premature deaths, and destruction of property that marked their lives-not now as maleficia, but as the crucial signs of the Puritan deity's loving displeasure. Conversely, the tradition of maleficia lent credence to Puritanism, for Puritan narrators felt no need to prove, to themselves or to others, that these events were preternatural, or even that they were expressions of a personally directed anger: maleficia bore the sanction of centuries of custom declaring them to be just that. And because these misfortunes had long been interpreted as the expression of someone's displeasure at someone else, they resembled biblical types as purposeful communications carrying semantic value. When the English witches per- formed maleficia, they acted out of anger, seeking vengeance against those who had denied or offended them. And so did the deity of the jeremiads, promising the vengeance of destruction for the sins that offended and denied him. Because the Puritan deity's "signs" were also the witch's maleficia, and because both were motivated by angry vengeance, the Puritans were threatened by belief in witchcraft as they never were by official religions such as Catholicism and Anglicanism. Arguments with these latter oppo- nents were always concerned with what constituted a proper religious practice, an efficacious invocation of supernatural power-the Catholic Mass or the Puritan Lord's Supper? The Anglican Prayer Book or the Puritan sermon? Dismissing these official religious opponents as frauds, the Puritans saved their credulity for the witch. Since Puritanism and witchcraft came to focus on the same set of events, in effect agreeing on what constituted a spiritual intervention in the natural world, the conten- tion with respect to the witch was not what constituted a properly super- natural event, but rather, who was producing it? From this perspective, the image of the deity as the author of remarkable providences, and the image of the witch as the author of maleficia, were positive and negative forms of a single idea about supernatural power.</page><page sequence="14">138 American Quarterly That the image of a deity is a projected image of power in human society is a long-standing, if not very well-understood, argument. What I would like to consider here instead is the way in which the negative form, the image of the witch, is similarly a projection. (The psychological phenome- non of projection is the location in another person of qualities or feelings which the subject does not recognize in the self.24 As a social relation, projection paradoxically permits the subject to enact prohibited behavior while still treating it as prohibited, for the projected qualities in turn become the rationale for the subject's own acts.) There is, of course, an important difference in the displacement: where the projected image of the deity is displaced on an imagined anthropomorphic being, the image of the witch is, in the act of accusation, displaced on a real human being. MacFar- lane has shown how projection describes the actions of accusers in English courts: when someone accused another person of angry and hostile acts of witchcraft, that is, maleficia, the accusation was an expression of hostility that was in turnjustified by the projected hostility. Moreover, the accuser's hostility was easy to discern, for it had already surfaced in some previous altercation. Accusers regularly produced explanations for why witchcraft had been practiced against them in particular, and their explanations fol- lowed a consistent pattern. Prior to the occurrence of some maleficium, the accused witch had asked for some trivial act of charity, or simply begged outright, and the accuser had refused them. Angry at this refusal, the accused witch sought reprisal through acts of witchcraft.25 The case against the accused witch, then, was not that the accused had acted with complete illogicality, without any provocation. Rather, the crime of the accused witch was that he or she had retaliated with grossly disproportionate anger and hostility. Sarah Good, the first person accused at Salem, fits the archetype of English cases, for she was an indigent villager who, according to the many witnesses testifying against her, was a chronic beggar in the town and was easily angered by refusals. According to MacFarlane's model, the Salem Villagers, angry at her continual begging because they were guilt-ridden by their own uncharitable refusals, expressed that anger in accusations of witchcraft. MacFarlane's interpretation is viable as far as it goes, but he neglects to show the importance of the specific accusation of witchcraft itself. The accused witch was not accused of hostile anger in the abstract, but of hostile anger expressed through particular maleficia. For example, when Sarah Gadge testified against Sarah Good, she first re- counted Good's entreaty, her own refusal, and Good's subsequent anger at being refused, all as MacFarlane's model predicts. But Gadge then went on to couple this sequence with another story of the sudden death of the Gadge cow, which the Gadges believed (and the court agreed) had been killed by 24See J. Laplanche and J.-B. Pontalis, The Language of Psychoanalysis, trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith (New York: W. W. Norton, 1973), 349 (def.

Demos and Boyer and Nissenbaum use MacFarlane's model.</page><page sequence="15">Mutations of the Supernatural 139 Good's retaliatory witchcraft.26 The projection offered by the witness and acted upon by the court was not just a general image of unjustified or disproportionate anger, but the image of Sarah Good as author of maleficium. How, then, can we interpret the attribution of maleficia as a projection? We can begin to answer this question by considering the one maleficium of medieval tradition we have not yet considered with respect to Puritanism: mysterious illnesses that often resulted in death. Over the course of the seventeenth century, this maleficium became an increasingly important indictment and seems to have focused on dependent family members as victims. As greater numbers of witches were accused of it, greater numbers of dependents appeared in court as afflicted accusers, like the "afflicted girls" of Salem. The murder of children was a relatively frequent accusation at Salem. In the precedent-setting case against Bridget Bishop, the first person tried and executed at Salem, witnesses related numerous stories of local children's deaths, many occurring before 1692 but all attributed to her supposed witchcraft. For instance, one married man testified he did "verily believe that the said Bridget Bishop was instrumental to his daughter Precilla' s death about two years ago. The child was a likely, thriving child, and suddently screeched out and so continued in an unusual manner for about a fortnight, and so died in that lamentable manner." Samuel Gray also believed that his child had died of witchcraft, recounting how he had seen the apparition of Bishop in his house at night, "standing between the cradle and the bedside." The apparition vanished, and then returned, and the child in the cradle gave a screech out, as if it was greatly hurt, and she disappeared. ... From which time, the child, that before was a very likely, thriving child, did pine away and was never well, although it lived some months after, yet in a sad condition, and so died. Samuel Shattoch, a middle-aged father like Samuel Gray, blamed his child's insanity on Bishop, whose frequent visits to his house seemed to him to coincide with his son's mental deterioration. As these narratives suggest, Salem residents saw the fits of the "afflicted girls" in the same light. They were, contemporaries observed, very like the fits and strange experiences other children had had before dying or becoming insane.27 The Puritan deity shared this maleficium, too, for deaths of dependents were among the most frequent of his remarkable providences. Although the doctrine of affliction has usually been understood as punishment of the self for the self s own sins, the deaths of Puritan children show that the idea was more complicated-and more painful-than this. Thomas recounts the Puritan Ralph Josselin's grief and anguish over Josselin's son's death: 26Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum, eds., Salem-Village Witchcraft: A Documentary Record of Local Conflict in Colonial New England (Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth, 1972), 14. 270n Continental cases, see Monter, Witchcraft in France and Switzerland, 100, 198. On Salem cases, see Boyer and Nissenbaum, Salem-Village Witchcraft, 42-43, 30.</page><page sequence="16">140 American Quarterly When the infant son of Ralph Josselin, vicar of Earl's Colne, Essex, died of diphtheria in 1648, his bereaved father sought to know which of his faults God was punishing, and concluded that the judgment must have partly been provoked by his vain thoughts and unseasonable playing at chess.28 The ambiguity in Thomas's pronouns arises from the social ambiguity in Josselin's head concerning who had died for what. Only when we realize that the infant son could not himself have played the chess games that killed him do we then understand that the father's sins caused the son's death- or so Josselin believed. The son's death was supposed to be "edifying" to the father, a mode of instruction that would reveal to Josselin the gravity of his, the father's, sins, and encourage him, the father, to repent. Thus the Puritan father was meant to "profit from affliction." Thomas Shepard, a minister in Cambridge, Massachusetts, arrived at the same explanation for John Shepard's death: "My son John, after sixteen weeks departed on the Sabbath-day morning, a day of rest, to the bosom of rest to him who gave it, which was no small affliction and heartbreaking to me that I should provoke the Lord to strike at my innocent children for my sake." Shepard similarly explained his wife's death: But the Lord hath not been wont to let me live long without some affliction or other ... he took away my dear, precious, meek and loving wife in childbed.... This affliction was very heavy to me, for in it the Lord seemed to withdraw his tender care for me and mine which he graciously manifested by my dear wife. . And I saw that if I had profited by former afflictions of this nature I should not have had this scourge.29 Men like Shepard interpreted their personal histories in the same way they understood the history of the Puritan community as a whole. Unusual events disrupting their personal lives were similarly interpreted as signs of the Puritan deity's disposition toward them as individuals. Thus, in the context of events in a Puritan man's individual life, the death of his wife or child became one more index to the state of his soul. Shepard, writing his autobiography, described his son as "innocent" and his wife as far more saintly than himself, but as he tells it, their grace did not outweigh the importance of his sin in the eyes of the Puritan deity. Both these dependents died, according to Shepard, for the instruction of their father's and hus- band's soul. These narratives imply there were limits to the concept of the 28Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic, 83. 29Thomas Shepard, "Autobiography," in Michael McGiffert, ed., God's Plot (Amherst: Univ. of Massachusetts Press, 1972), 69, 70 (italics added).</page><page sequence="17">Mutations of the Supernatural 141 Puritan father's power, that each father was held responsible only for deaths of dependents in his immediate family. Anthony Thacher's story of his disastrous voyage to Marblehead bears this out. He blamed himself for the deaths of his own children, but not for the deaths in his cousin Avery's family. In commemorating the tragedy, he named each of the fathers on the voyage and, of course, only them: "In a boat that came that way, we went off the desolate island, which I named after my name, Thacher's Woe; and the rock, Avery his Fall: to the end that their fall and loss, and mine own, might be had in perpetual remembrance."30 To be an unnamed dependent, in this story as in others, meant that the wife's or child's very life was only a function of the husband's or father's moral condition in the eyes of the deity, a sacrifice toward the education of someone else's soul. When Thomas Shepard himself died in 1649, just a few years after his son and first wife, no one related his death to the sins of his surviving sons or second wife. He was thought to have died autonomously, just as Avery had died in his own right in the storm. Insofar as the deaths of wives and children were believed to be the result of the husband's or father's sins, the Puritan adult male, if he married, acquired a power commensurate with the witch's. Within this religious framework the nature of his relationship to his dependents was in effect the same as the witch's relationship to other members of the community. This likeness is particularly important because it suggests a perspective for the whole pattern of resemblance between the acts of the deity and the witch. The maleficium that resulted in personal injury or death emphasizes an aspect of Puritan thought that is less obvious, but still present, in other accounts of remarkable providences: the belief in the indirect power of the Puritan adult male's own moral acts to literally destroy the lives of people around him. Ironically, despite a man's theological guilt before the deity, the Puritan father and husband whose sins supposedly caused the destruction of prop- erty, or worse, the deaths of his wife and children, received no blame from society; his grief and guilt were his double testimony of his social innocence and his spiritual grace. As for his dependents, their grace consisted in their willingness to be sacrificed. As Thomas Shepard observed of his wife, "She was a woman of incomparable meekness of spirit, toward myself especially," and "she was fit to die long before she did die. " 3 1 Despite the power Puritan men assigned to themselves, such as Shepard believed he held over his wife, it would be erroneous to presume that a Puritan man was enjoined by his religion to feel guilt for the death of a dependent per se. These deaths were the consequences of the soul's sin, of his offense against the deity, and in order to "profit from affliction" the Puritan father or husband had to repent to the deity for the sin that had led the deity to punish 30"Thacher's Narrative," 494. 3'Shepard, "Autobiography," 70-71.</page><page sequence="18">142 American Quarterly him by the death of his wife or child. The sin, not the death, was the theological source of guilt. Personal narratives imply that this displacement could be a very painful experience, that the theological shift of focus from the death to the sin that 'caused' it left a reservoir of unresolved grief and guilt. Shepard, after advancing the doctrine of affliction to explain his wife's death, then pro- tested, "but this loss was very great." He continued praising her and finally balked at the whole self-conception demanded of him by Puritan religion: "Thus God hath visited and scourged me for my sins and sought to wean me from this world, but I have ever found it a difficult thing to profit even but a little by the sorest and sharpest affliction." His autobiography stops abruptly here, just short of total disbelief, as if he were too horrified and pained by the deaths he believed he had inscribed with the sins of his soul to continue to narrate his life. Anthony Thacher also implied that he could not fully accept the doctrine of affliction, expressing his grief at one point by attempting to attribute his children's deaths more directly to his own acts. He remarked at one point, "Then it came to mind how I had occasioned the death of my children, who caused them to leave their native land, who might have left them there, yea, and might have sent some of them back again and cost me nothing; these and such like thoughts do press down my heavy heart very much. But I must let this pass." The deity of remarkable providences notwithstanding, Thacher momentarily expressed more direct guilt, and more direct responsibility, for his children's deaths.32 The concept of the deity that assigned the power of maleficia to Puritan men also prohibited the recognition of that power for clerics such as Shepard, concealing it in the necessity for repentance to divine power and attributing remarkable providences to the deity of the jeremiads. But to the extent that Puritan fathers such as Thacher claimed a personal responsibil- ity for the deaths of family dependents, the locus of the power to enact remarkable providences/maleficia overtly shifted from the deity to the Puritan adult male. Of course, Thacher could not have known in England that two years after his immigration his children would die in a storm while traveling from Ipswich to Marblehead, but he nevertheless implies that he could and should have been omniscient-more like the deity. Such shifts as occur in the Thacher narrative invite us to consider that the persistent resemblance between the Puritan deity and the witch was itself a displace- ment, mirroring a more fundamental tension in Puritan social thought: the resemblance between the Puritan concept of the father and husband and the concept of the witch as the author of maleficia. Puritan sermons also suggest a displacement, for the most frequent description of the deity was the metaphor of the father, and the convert's relation to the deity was described in terms of the metaphor of marriage to this figured father/ husband. What Puritan fathers confronted in the Puritan concept of the 32Ibid., 71; "Thacher's Narrative," 493.</page><page sequence="19">Mutations of the Supernatural 143 deity, then, was a projected figure of their own social role. The conflicting interpretations of remarkable providences/maleficia in personal narratives of dependents' deaths reflected the conflict engendered in individual Puri- tan fathers by this contradictory system of religious language: while the use of the metaphor of the father greatly enhanced the power of literal fathers by associating them closely but ambiguously with divine power, it con- tradictorily demanded that an adult male see himself figuratively and theologically as a powerless "child of God." The resemblance between witchcraft beliefs and remarkable provi- dences, between the power of the traditional European sorcerer-witch and the power of Puritan husbands and fathers, shows that traditional cultural beliefs about witchcraft strongly influenced the concept of the deity and the concept of the adult male social role in seventeenth-century Puritan cul- ture. It suggests as well that some of our previous assumptions about the history of witchcraft beliefs have diverted us from asking major interpre- tive questions about witchcraft prosecutions. While I cannot here offer a comprehensive model for interpreting the Salem prosecutions, let me suggest some of the possible implications of this essay and give some examples of what sort of inquiries we might make in constructing such a model. First, that the concept of maleficia continued to inform the concept of the Puritan father's power, but that this concept had become intolerable for many people, is implied in at least two important ways in the Salem trials. When Thomas Putnam journeyed with three other men into Salem town to enter the first charge of witchcraft in February, 1692, setting in motion the infamous trials, in effect he turned his back on the conventional doctrine of affliction as a way to explain the strange, disturbing behavior of his daugh- ter, Ann Putnam, his servant, Mercy Lewis, and his niece who lived with him, Mary Walcott. His wife, Ann Carr Putnam, would soon become "afflicted" too. In effect, his accusation of witchcraft meant that their fits and seizures were not the result of his own sins. They were, rather, caused by someone else-a witch. From the broader perspective of Puritan cul- tural assumptions, the point is not that there was no explanation for the behavior of the "afflicted girls. " Indeed, this way of describing them refers us to it. Nonetheless, that Putnam made the accusations suggests that important changes had occurred in the cultural experience of Puritan fathers and husbands in the late seventeenth century, changes that made the doctrine of affliction so undesirable or implausible that Putnam refused the self-interpretation it offered him, and reverted instead to the older explanation of such events as the maleficia of witchcraft. In the assertion that his family members were "afflicted" by witchcraft was the oblique confession of Putnam's own lack of power as a Puritan father, and perhaps this aspect of his accusation had something to do with the positive response he received from legal authority. Boyer and Nissenbaum have documented the numerous occasions before 1692 on which Putnam men had made appeals to legal authority and lost, emphasizing the seeming irony of</page><page sequence="20">144 American Quarterly Thomas Putnam's immense success in 1692 from this perspective. But insofar as Putnam was asserting his own lack of power, a lack that success- ful prosecution would only validate, the positive response of legal authority was quite consistent with its earlier refusals to help Putnam either acquire or recover political and economic power.33 That Putnam's individual dilemma and his choice of a solution evoked widely shared attitudes is suggested not only by the large public response in favor of the trials and concern for the "afflicted girls," but also by elements of subsequent accusations. For example, the accusations against George Burroughs, the first Puritan man accused at Salem, are a mirror image in negative form of the powers of Puritan fathers and husbands. In the initial deposition, Ann Putnam's, Burroughs was accused of killing his first two wives. Other "witnesses" corroborated her testimony, Susanna Sheldon elaborating that "He appeared to me at the house of Nathanniel Ingolson and told me he had been the death of three children at the eastward and had killed two of his wives, the first he smothered and the second he choked, and killed two of his own children. " Burroughs, like other defendants, was also accused of causing the fits of the "afflicted girls, " but more severely in his case, "almost choking them to death." The "witchcraft" Burroughs practiced, however, was none other than a diabolic version of Puritanism itself. His case record contains the first deposition on Black Sabbaths at Salem, a staid parody of a Congregational service that the Salem judges construed as witchcraft. Burroughs, a former minister of Salem village, was accused of returning to hold illicit diabolic services at night-in the pasture next to the parish house of the current minister, an appropriate metaphor for displacement. A minister as well as a husband and father who had suffered the deaths of spouses and children, Burroughs was a particu- larly apt "place" to project the power attributed to adult men by the deity of remarkable providences. Boyer and Nissenbaum show that the accusa- tions against Burroughs were an important turning point in the develop- ment of the Salem trials, that after these charges were made accusations increased rapidly and the Salem trials assumed major proportions. It is also true that, relative to preceeding accusations, this watershed case focused with unusual clarity on the power of adult men in relation to the deaths of family dependents, and associated that power with an organized sect and formal religious thought that is easily recognizable as a parodic inversion of Puritan church ordinances.34 A second dimension of relevance concerns the power of figurative "fa- ther," how the Puritan concept of a literal father's power influenced concepts of public authority. In a colony where the public authority of men was explicitly justified by analogy with the structure and character of 330n Thomas Putnam and the Putnam family, see Boyer and Nissenbaum, Salem Pos- sessed, 5-6, 110-52. 34Boyer and Nissenbaum, Salem-Village Witchcraft, 68-69, 73-74, 77, 79, 70, 82.</page><page sequence="21">Mutations of the Supernatural 145 power in the literal family, how far did the concept of maleficialremarkable providences also define the power of public "patriarchs?" Historians have long argued that the effects of the Glorious Revolution on the colony government were an important influence on the Salem prosecutions, that it was not sheer coincidence that prosecutions occurred at a time of instabil- ity and confusion about the character of legal authority in the colony. Since the Salem court was convened for the sole purpose of trying witchcraft cases, it seems plausible that its contribution to changing concepts of legal power would especially reflect the importance of maleficia. That is, what the figurative "fathers" of the court borrowed through the analogy of the family was not just a general notion of partriarchy, but rather the more specific concept of the Puritan father's power over his dependents as it resembled maleficia. Since the case records repeatedly show that the judges were hardly impartial observers and frequently adopted an accusa- tory stance themselves, we could well begin to explore this question by extending MacFarlane's model to the court itself. Did the capacity to intentionally cause sudden death as an act of revenge, an expression of disproportionate anger, describe the social character of the Salem court's power? If we set aside the concept of the deity/witch as the cause of events, the concept that overtly justified the prosecutions, then the projection becomes apparent: although the defendants were the ones accused of exacting revenge, it was the court -and the witnesses through the power of the court-who actually got it. Without the concealment of supernatural intervention, the discernable social facts in the Salem testimony show only the occurrence of petty offenses to which the court responded by sanction- ing legal murder. In Sarah Good's case, for example, her acts of begging were punished with execution, surely a grossly disproportionate response to such trivial social offenses. In short, what legal authority condemned in the accused it also enacted in the very process of condemnation. What the legal process seems to have offered witnesses was the vicarious satisfaction of a new mutation of maleficia in a systematically "true" projection produced at the will of the court but guided by the "requests" for specific targets named in witnesses' accusations: the gratuitous execu- tion (sudden death) of "witches" and the confiscation (destruction) of their property. Indeed, the court delivered with unerring accuracy, for the conviction rate at Salem was astonishingly high, even by Continental standards-one hundred percent.35 Unlike literal fathers, the figurative fathers of judicial authority possessed a real social power to intentionally cause death and destruction by secular means. However much Puritan fathers such as Shepard may have believed that the deaths of their depen- dents were the intentional punitive consequences of their own sins, from a 350n European conviction rates, see Midelfort, Witch-hunting in Southwestern Germany, 179-81; Monter, Witchcraft in France and Switzerland, 119-23.</page><page sequence="22">146 American Quarterly secular point of view this is no more plausible than the capacity of accused witches to actually accomplish maleficia. From a secular point of view, the court's version of themselves as the cause of death and destruction is much more persuasive. Moreover, the court claimed a conscious intention: it did not simply offer retroactive explanations for unwitting death and destruc- tion, but intentionally produced such events through the purportedly ra- tional mechanism of the legal process. In this sense, the judicial authority of the Salem court freed itself from the accidents of remarkable providences as the unpredictable occasions for the expression of its "fatherly" power, and consequently freed itself in a crucial way from the power of the Puritan deity.36 Extending MacFarlane's model in this way shifts the primary point of tension away from the relation between witnesses and the accused and toward the relation between court authority and the accused. This is exactly where the history of witchcraft beliefs indicates the focus really was, however, for the century of great persecution was marked first and foremost by the widespread execution of people for witchcraft through the mechanism of the legal process of the state. After all, people had believed in witches for centuries, and private citizens had made informal accusa- tions of witchcraft and punished witches for just as long. What was new in early modern Europe, and what distinguished Salem in the New England history of witchcraft beliefs, was the massive intervention of state author- ity to prosecute witchcraft-and the subsequent epidemic of accusations and executions that intervention produced. The Salem trials may also have been an expression of new conflicts among men about different versions of figurative fatherly power. Did the court in effect assert a new superiority of the figurative "fathers" of state power, attacking men who refused to be obedient "sons" in the new patriarchy of the new charter? That the figurative dimension of fatherly power was important in the Salem trials is suggested by the fact that the figurative "fathers" of the court found very cooperative witnesses in women and girls who, as servants or slaves, knew well how to live by this analogy: Mary Warren, servant of John Proctor; Mercy Lewis, servant of Thomas Putnam; Sarah Churchill, servant of George Jacobs; Tituba, slave of Samuel Parris; and Elizabeth Hubbard, servant of William Griggs. Two more major witnesses, Abigail Williams and Mary Walcott, were living in the households of their uncles at the time of the trials. Of all the "afflicted" who were consistently the center of attention and the main source of testimony, only two, Ann Putnam and Elizabeth Parris, were living in the households of their literal fathers -and both these fathers were among the 36No wonder, then, that the clergy for the most part opposed the trials.

The depositions of female servants include complaints of mistreatment by their employers, suggest- ing that young women like Mary Warren and Sarah Churchill exploited the power of one father-figure to retaliate against another. The court in turn exploited the grievances of the "afflicted" servants to punish men like Proctor and Jacobs who expressed disdain for the court's power. Whatever the individual antagonisms here, the struggle between the figurative "fa- thers" of the court and the figurative "fathers" of private households seems to have been an important dimension of the Salem trials.37 Finally, understanding the importance of maleficia for the Puritan con- cept of adult male power enables us to ask different kinds of questions about the accusations made against women at Salem. Since the power of maleficialremarkable providences had been attributed throughout the seventeenth century to a deity invariably described as male, or to adult men by means of their sins, how can we explain the accusations against women at Salem? That women should be prone to accusations of witchcraft has always been taken for granted, but since Puritan culture so strongly as- sociated the power of maleficia with adult males, we need to ask seriously why and how were women accused of witchcraft at Salem at all? The research of Boyer and Nissenbaum is an instructive point of departure insofar as it interprets the wider social context of conflicts between women expressed in court depositions. Boyer and Nissenbaum, analyzing eco- nomic conditions in Salem Village, argue that traditionalist agrarians such as Thomas Putnam, whose status was declining, were extremely jealous of arrived, newly successful men like Daniel Andrew and Philip English, who were accused of witchcraft. What Boyer and Nissenbaum ignore is the relevance of these same economic tensions to accusations among married women. For example, their lengthy discussion of Thomas Putnam, the leading male accuser, culminates very oddly-in speculation about his wife's grievances with other wives in order to explain her accusations against such women as Rebecca Nurse. What their own evidence most clearly suggests, however, is that Thomas Putnam, through his wife, at- tacked Francis Nurse, through his wife. Francis Nurse was an econom- ically successful late arrival in Salem Village, just the sort of enterprising upstart who, Boyer and Nissenbaum argue, was vulnerable to accusa- tion.38 In a society where the experiences of wives and children, indeed their very lives, were mere signs of an adult male's own personal success or failure, where the identity of family dependents was a mere extension of 37Boyer and Nissenbaum, Salem Possessed, 5-6, 35n. The "girls" are also identified in arrest warrants in Boyer and Nissenbaum, Salem Witchcraft Papers, passim. Further infor- mation appears in depositions against their employers, among which see esp. the George Jacobs and John Proctor case records. 38Boyer and Nissenbaum, Salem Possessed, 80-109, 120-22, 131-32, 147, 181-82, 192, 210; and Salem-Village Witchcraft, 148-54.

That Puritan culture still very strongly associated the power of witchcraft with the power of adult men, to the point that Puritan men were actually hesitant to ascribe maleficia to women alone-despite centuries of custom that would have supported such accusations-is suggested by the impact of the accusations against Burroughs. Reportedly, the Black Sabbaths of the diabolical Burroughs were initially attended by the women who had already been accused of witchcraft, and only when these already accused women were further accused of having acquired their power of maleficia from an adult male did the Salem trials begin to take on major proportions. Conceivably, the crime of which women were accused at Salem was really two-fold: not only that they were engaging in maleficia, but that they were women engaging in maleficia, attempting to take for themselves a power that Puritan culture had come to associate with adult male sexual identity.</page></plain_text>
