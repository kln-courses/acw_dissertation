Studies in economic sociology of personal networks and overlapping trust relations among directors of major corporations, however, regard trust (or mistrust) as more exclusively a "property" of direct relationships. Personal trust relations, this study argues, are qualitatively differentfrom impersonal ones, such as global mediating organizations of trust that give institutional promises to guard investments againstfuture risk. They attempt tofulfill the claims of economic rationality in the face of the insuperable problem of temporality. Impersonal trust organizations include multinational accountancy firms and credit-rating agencies that provide allegedly reliable and objective rat- ings offirms and governments tofinancial speculators. Although a director of Moody's Investors Services argues (with reference to the 1997 East Asian "crisis ") that "markets are made up of atomised individuals, outside the con- trols of even the most vigilant governments, " this neglects the mediating trust organization itself, an "authority" that not only constantly tries to maintain its trustworthy appearance but one that unintentionally gives rise to increasing constraints and lack of agency. The implications of paying greater attention to impersonal trust in such global organizations are discussed. New claims against the "imperialism" of economics are emerging from sociologi- cal research on trust relations, the sociology of emotions, the revival of economic sociology, and, in some of the social capital literature, trust as economically advan- tageous. Another, apparently less auspicious kind of trust is entailed in the fast- moving international flows of money invested "in trust" for millions in the indus- trialized world by mutual funds. This study compares such "impersonal" forms of trust with those accounts in the "social trust" literature that often assimilate direct, person-to-person relations of trust to the more indirect, impersonal rela- tions. In contrast, by making clear distinctions between the two types of interaction, it is possible to highlight serious dilemmas in impersonal trust relations between * Direct all correspondence to: Jocelyn Pixley, School of Sociology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, 2052 Australia; e-mail: J.Pixley@unsw.edu.au.</page><page sequence="2">648 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 42, Number 4,1999 organizations that are rarely considered in the trust literature, let alone in eco- nomic debates about trust, rationality, and time. Many accounts of trust (e.g., Fukuyama 1995; Misztal 1996; Putnam 1996; Selig- man 1997) assume a contemporary devaluation of trust and a loss of "ability to trust" (Seligman 1997:173). Some seek "new bases for integration" despite alleged difficulties in attaining trust (Misztal 1996:9). Whereas Putnam (1996) and Fuku- yama (1995) both use the concept of trust as a corollary of social solidarity or asso- ciation, for Putnam association is defined more in political terms and the extent of state intervention is largely irrelevant to the extent of civic engagement, and for Fukuyama trust is defined more in economic terms and state intervention is inversely related to associations of trust. Since the concern of this article is with the economic side of trust, I focus more on the latter than the vigorous debates about civic engagement fostered by Putnam's work (Seligman 1997:77; Woolcock 1998:57). Fukuyama's Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity (1995) argues that there are competitive economic advantages that nations gain from developed relations of "trust." Aptly described as a "comparative sociology of economic per- formance" (Desai 1995), the social trust thesis proposes a nonstate cure for falter- ing or "backward" economies. It assumes that national economies are locked in international competition where losers are those that fail to develop internal rela- tions of trust. Fukuyama's liberal individualism leads him to reject a role for dem- ocratic governments in economic intervention, on the one hand, and to ignore external impersonal interconnections such as those between corporations and the global movements of speculative finance, on the other. Instead, Fukuyama (1995:354) holds that neoclassical economics is mostly correct; however, cultural (individual "national") differences ultimately explain different economic perfor- mance. While this sounds like a Weberian approach, it does not describe a crude "spirit of capitalism"-that "nullity" emerging from acquisitiveness as a way of life, as Weber bluntly put it-but a "spiritualization" of economic life through "social virtues" that render some national economies more competitive and pros- perous than others.1 Vaguer notions about social trust as a nonstate "solution" to the bleak economic trends often ascribed to "globalization" became commonplace among journalists and political parties in the early 1990s. "Social trust" was an element of the "third way" embraced by British Prime Minister Blair's "New Labour," a political program that attempts to counteract contemporary doubts about even speaking of "national economies" as well as alarmist themes like Greider's One World, Ready or Not (1997) or Martin and Schumann's The Global Trap (1997). Even so, between these various poles-the frankly neo-Marxist conspiratorial, the blandly liberal nation- alist and neoclassical economics that aggregates market actors-it is not possible to ignore international economic trends such as the increased power of global cor- porations and the impact of speculative finance. Yet as Przeworski argues, "We know very little and understand next to nothing about 'globalization.' All we have so far is slogans and anecdotes. . . . We have these bodies that are not accountable to anybody, anywhere" (1997:11). While Przeworski's statement is largely correct, it may be preferable to avoid</page><page sequence="3">Global Mediating Organizations 649 the blanket slogan "globalization" altogether and instead focus on particular dis- aggregated international trends, one being speculative finance. Although finance is a vast research field itself, sociological analysis of this mode of economic activ- ity is sparse.2 Here I simply draw on the sociology of trust literature and debates on economic rationality and time that might help explain the role of several global mediating organizations that peddle their trustworthiness in the financial mar- kets. Their activities entail specific relations of impersonal trust that are not dimin- ishing (regardless of whether "trust" namely, personal trust, is in decline). Indeed, their growing scope and influence illustrate an emerging "global" structural pat- tern that vanishes from sight in neoclassical economics as much as in the liberal defense of "social trust." DIRECT AND INDIRECT RELATIONS OF TRUST The category of social capital emerged from institutional economics and the soci- ology of economic development.3 Although Putnam's work, for example, is more concerned with revitalizing democracy, one tendency is to use the term "social capital" to describe an additional source of and/or benefit to existing market activities that allegedly renders capitalist economies more efficient. Moreover, Putnam (1996:46) makes a clear division between direct and indirect impersonal relations and claims (rightly or not) that mediated relations (such as television watching) is associated with less "social trust" and with a decline in group mem- bership in voluntary associations. Putnam's (1996:34) description of social capital is explicitly about direct secondary relationships, for he excludes those organiza- tions in which members do not meet one another. The impersonal ties in a bureau- cracy or in a voluntary group membership linked only by common symbols and ideologies (e.g., a mailing-list organization) do not foster the "social connected- ness" Putnam (1996:35) has in mind as the alleged cure to America's ills. The problem with confining analysis to direct personal relations is that the cor- poration and the bureaucracy tend to be lost from focus. And yet, as Calhoun (1992) emphasizes in an important paper, indirect social relationships (notably via the corporation and government bureaucracy) are not only different from direct relations but are one of the defining features of modernity. But in contrast to Put- nam and to Seligman as well,4 much of the social trust literature fails to specify whether the type of social relationship is a direct or an indirect one, and this con- fusion is readily apparent in the commonplace uses of social trust, such as politi- cal programs for a third way. Fukuyama's emphasis on the economic efficiency to be gained from "trust" provides a relevant model that I will describe briefly as a heuristic device to show how it leads to more commonplace confusions. Fukuyama's thesis is that there is a strong relationship between what he calls "high-trust societies with plentiful social capital" and the ability to create large private corporations. His major examples are Germany, the United States, and Japan (1995:30). Trust apparently has "a large and measurable economic value" and without it, Fukuyama asserts, capitalism cannot "function properly" (p. 10). He defends the neoclassical eco-</page><page sequence="4">650 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 42, Number 4,1999 nomic model, because its depiction of "rational, self-interested behaviour is cor- rect about eighty per cent of the time." His criticism is simply that neoclassical economics is too "divorced" from culture. With due acknowledgment to eco- nomic sociologists like Swedberg and Granovetter, he defines culture as the cus- toms, morals, and habits of the society in which economic life is embedded (p. 13). While the "institutions of capitalism and democracy" are modern, in contrast, "reciprocity, duty toward community, and trust," Fukuyama alleges, are "pre- modern cultural habits," "based in habit rather than rational calculation" (p. 11). What trust relations does Fukuyama specify? If trust is apparently a "pre- modern" personal relationship, Fukuyama argues that successful economies are those that transcend kinship or familial trust-entailed in what sociologists call pri- mary relationships, although familiarity as well as loyalty and reciprocity (and their opposites) are, one could suggest, more explicit in primary groups than the largely implicit trust in these relations.5 Fukuyama's concern is rather that kinship-based economies (or national societies?) fail to generate broader "social trust" through membership in voluntary associations (p. 29). The latter are what sociologists would call secondary relationships based on specific social roles,6 and again, trust is not the only emotional state generated by secondary relationships. Leaving that problem aside, trust relations are economically more effective, according to Fukuyama, when extended into secondary group (but nonstate) associations in civil society, because they apparently promote macroeconomic development without the allegedly heavy hand of state "social engineering." Fukuyama compares French government support of industries (negatively) with Japan's successful economy (currently, as we know, in "difficulties"), citing Japan's lifetime employment and business networks (the keiretsu), to conclude that this kind of success "depends on the pervasive ability to enter into high-trust relationships" in Japan (p. 197). Japanese network organizations (and their counterparts such as German cartels and U.S. "trusts" of shared directors and informal networks)7 are, Fukuyama sug- gests, different from the two major types of "Western" exchange relations, namely, market relations (contracts between "completely independent actors") and hierar- chical relations (administrative fiat inside corporations). That is, he draws on economists' distinction between markets and hierarchies (p. 204), but adds this third way of personal networks.8 Fukuyama argues that even business networks where members have "no necessary economic connection" must somehow entail economic dealing wherein "group members know each other well and trust one another," as it saves on the information and transaction costs of "buying from a stranger" (p. 202). Fukuyama's extension of direct secondary trust relations to macroeconomic outcomes is both dubious and ambiguous. Moreover, Fukuyama entirely accepts the claim of neoclassical economics that modem economies arise out of the interactions of rational, utility-maximizing individuals in markets (p. 351). He merely argues that neoclassical economics neglects how secondary trust relations can account for those economies successful enough to be able to generate large corporations. Although Fukuyama does criticize economic imperialism (Desai 1995), his use of sociological concepts adds a residue of trust without disputing the tenets of</page><page sequence="5">Global Mediating Organizations 651 TABLE 1 Typology of Social Relations from More to Less Symmetrical* Symmetrical Asymmetrical Direct social relations Primary Primary (Person-to-person) Secondary Secondary Corporations Indirect social relations I Bureaucracy "Natural person" (Impersonal) Information technology to to Corporation Corporation Bureaucracy Bureaucracy Information technology Information technology * Many inter- and intrarelations between corporations and state bureaucracies are also asymmetrical.

But "trust" for many economists is often dismissed as a mere "lubricant" dealt with by sociology or even the "tosh," according to Wil- liamson, whereas economics is alleged to deal with the essentials and rational "core" (cited in Ingham 1996:245, 250; see also Dasgupta 1988:64). Two flaws in this social trust debate are relevant here. One is the uncritical acceptance of ratio- nal calculation and large corporations and the failure to draw on the complex sociological literature on trust or even that most relevant to economic rationality and temporality (e.g., Barbalet 1996, 1998; Heimer 1976; Lekachman 1957; Luh- mann 1979, 1988; Shapiro 1987). The other flaw is Fukuyama's dubious move from direct secondary relations of trust (e.g., directors' networks) to macroeco- nomic outcomes, with little consideration of indirect social relationships (as Table 1 lays out). In both these moves, one can see parallels in the more simplis- tic diagnoses of journalists and orthodox economists, in the light of the subse- quent financial "crises" in Southeast Asia in 1997-98, for example, which confused both levels of analysis, personalized the crises, and tried to attribute the entire range of serious problems to "crony capitalism." That is, these popu- lar accounts of trust no longer give it the positive connotations provided in this recent social capital literature. The scale, frequency, and significance of indirect social relations are, as Cal- houn (1992) stresses, increasingly the dominant mode of social integration in modernity. Impersonal trust, so ignored in the social capital/ trust literature, is merely one type of indirect social relationship, but it is closely implicated in economic rationality. Accordingly, I now move on to discuss the relation be- tween rationality and trust. Following that, indirect relations are considered, less those between the individual person and the corporation (which are highly asymmetrical) and more between corporations and corporations, where imper- sonal trust takes a structural role poorly explained by actor network studies or conspiracy "theories."</page><page sequence="6">652 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 42, Number 4,1999 RATIONALITY AND TRUST Those who accept economic rationality tend to retain the commonplace dualism between emotion and rationality. This is disputed in sociology and psychology and implicitly in history. The best-laid schemes often go wrong.9 "Because of our uncertain knowledge and multiple goals, many of the problems we face have no fully rational solutions," according to the psychologist Keith Oatley (1992:162). Moreover, individual rationality is hard to attain not because of emotional "irra- tionality" but because we as individuals are rarely able or willing to explore "the implications of all possible mistakes," as Oatley (1992:165) says, in a logical and analytical manner (see also Lane 1991:52). Thought may be irrational and repre- sentative whereas, Barbalet (1996) suggests, substantive rationality requires emo- tional commitments of loyalty, confidence, or trust. These are the emotions that are oriented to the future and usually associated with lower feeling states than, say, fear, love, or anger, and they also have a higher cognitive element (Barbalet 1996:91). Moreover, far from being in short supply or "premodem," as the social trust thesis suggests, they are essential to organization, cooperation, and action, because they surmount the inherent problems of rationality and temporality in modern life (Barbalet 1996:91; Luhmann 1988:98). Trust is relatively modern, according to Luhmann (1988:97), because it "presup- poses a situation of risk," a term that gradually replaced fortuna (p. 96). He con- trasts expectations of confidence with those of trust (contentiously since others suggest that faith, loyalty, or cynicism is often as operative in asymmetrical rela- tions as the positive "confidence").10 For Luhmann, trust entails a choice (or cal- culation) between one action in preference to others where the subsequent disappointment or success has depended on "your own previous behaviour" (p. 98). That is, where both emotions of trust and confidence are positive expecta- tions about the future "which may be disappointed," if things do turn out badly one will attribute blame quite differently. In the case of confidence, blame is set down to external events ("the bus crash" or "the manager") because previous alternatives were either not considered or perceived or simply not available.11 In the contrasting case of trust, one will blame oneself for trusting one risky alternative over others. If a situation involves very low risks, trust is hardly necessary; however, trust depends on risk, not on danger, because "if you refrain from action you run no risk" (Luhmann 1988:100).12 So where risk entails the prospect of a positive outcome (as it does for entrepreneurs, speculators, and gamblers of all kinds), Luhmann's thesis prevails; the perception and evaluation of risk entails an "internal calcula- tion of external conditions" that promotes both risk-taking and risk-avoiding through trusting or distrusting. In particular, he locates the source of modern individualism in the "risk-calculating merchants, learning from experience, atten- tive to news, [and] making decisions" (p. 100), far from Fukuyama's conception of trust as a premodern "habit." Put more bluntly, confidence and trust relationships are not associated with mutuality or reciprocity but rather with vulnerability and uncertainty (Heimer 1976). Vulnerability occurs in those interactions involving future winners / losers, rewards/ costs, with uncertainty felt about others' intentions and about the likely outcome in vulnerable interactions. The inability to predict a positive outcome, as we have</page><page sequence="7">Global Mediating Organizations 653 seen, entails risk rather than danger when sufficient alternatives allow the choice to avoid taking particular risks. In the management of "trust problems," as Heimer puts it, the usual strategy in direct relationships is to reduce uncertainty (a trust relation) through the relatively "certain" expectation that community control over behavior of others, internaliza- tion of norms, or commitment to continue relationships will prevail. This is the person-to-person embeddedness thesis of network studies. Heimer argues that with the extensive increase in contact with strangers in modem life, a typical modern strategy is to reduce vulnerability (a distrust relation) by spreading or insuring against future risk. Economic rationality, in my view, entails impersonal reduction of vulnerability and of uncertainty. This leads the large institutional pension and insurance funds, as discussed below, to spread risks, to demand policies that pro- vide some certainty over other unpredictable activities, and to attempt to disci- pline corporations and government bodies for a similar end. ECONOMIC RATIONALITY AND TRUST IN THE FUTURE Economic rationality is as much dependent on emotions of trust as rationality in general, to develop the argument above. Rational calculations are made in choos- ing, preparing, and planning an action to be taken in the present that may be vali- dated as a correct action in some future time, tomorrow or in two or twenty years. But how can one be "certain" that the particular choice will prove correct? Ratio- nality, as used by economists, refers to decision making,13 assumes a procedure, and imputes individualistic calculations.14 Stinchcombe (1990:1) argues that "ratio- nality necessarily involves an analysis of the future, because the consequences that give purpose to acts are necessarily in the future. Thus all rationality is based on predictions of one kind or another, not on knowledge." But whereas neoclassical economics assumes that the only relevant information for investment decisions is in financial quantities, for neo-Keynesians, Post Keynesians, and most sociolo- gists, "the idea that investment can operate with only financial and universally available knowledge assumes a kind of knowledge about the future that human actors do not and cannot have" (Stinchcombe 1990:1). Temporality and the future, as Barbalet argues (1996:84), are neglected in sociol- ogy: few analyses face "the unavoidability of an unknowable future." The prob- lem of time and its effects, however, is much more difficult when economic rationality is assumed to be quite separate from emotions of trust. At most, econ- omists perceive trust as an externality that acts as a lubricant to rational choice in the form of a commodified reputation of trustworthiness (Dasgupta 1988:64). In contrast, for Luhmann (1979:10), a "theory of trust presupposes a theory of time," because trust has "a problematic relationship with time. To show trust is to anticipate the future. It is to behave as though the future were certain." To put the matter more accurately, to show trust is to experience the emotion that the future can be anticipated although it cannot (despite orthodox economic faith in probability distributions). Luhmann's more contentious, system-theoretical position is that trust is a means of reducing complexity. Yet as he rightly says of the future,</page><page sequence="8">654 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 42, Number 4,1999 The problem of trust. .. consists in the fact that the future contains far more possibilities than could ever be realized in the present and hence be transferred into the past. The uncertainty which is bound to exist is simply a consequence of the very elementary fact that not all futures can become the present and hence become the past. (Luhmann 1979:13) So how does economic rationality manage the problems of the unknowable and the multiplicity of possible futures in a world of radical uncertainty? Keynes became famous for emphasizing time, contingency, and the habitual and for rejecting the "long run," although few sociologists of his day followed this up (Giddens 1987:186; Ingham 1996:259). Moreover, he relied on what Ingham (1996:257) charges are "ad hoc subjectivist and somewhat tautological concepts-such as 'animal spirits."' Keynes admitted he was ignorant of the determinants of psychological moods like the fluctuating "animal spirits" of investors, and therefore he took them as givens (Vickrey 1957:377). In contrast, Weber disputed orthodox (marginalist) rational choice claims that economic rationality is about the universal economic problem of "rational provi- sion of human needs" based on an alleged human propensity to exchange (truck and barter),15 for economic rationality is not such a self-evident "truth" (Clarke 1982:200). As Weber said, "it is by no means obvious" that ceaseless, single- minded risk calculations about future profitability "should happen at all times and places" (cited in Ingham 1996:256). In Luhmann's (1988:100) terms, the highly subjective perception, weighing, and taking of risks in the expectation (trust) of profit must be continuous. Thus, apart from Weber's attempt to reconstruct the typical social meanings of routine capitalistic calculations (namely, acquisition as the purpose of life), he located the time-bound nature of such ceaseless calculations of alternative returns to capital in the relative predictability of the power distribution and in the bureau- cratic corporation. These are noneconomic mechanisms (Ingham 1996:256-57), which enable one to locate impersonal relations of trust-the reduction of uncer- tainty and of vulnerability-at the heart of "economic rationality." Keynes's noneconomic assumptions, according to Lekachman (1957), are poorly theorized because their dependence on sociology and psychology remained unde- veloped. What eventuated under the Keynesian "revolution" was macroeconomic forecasting-a form of aggregative empiricism, investigating the structures of "expectations" and attitudes in the hope that this could predict future behavior (Katona 1957:361) and be valid at a macroeconomic level. So if Keynes is impor- tant for incorporating time and uncertainty, Keynesian research programs failed to deal with time (Lekachman 1957:343-51).16 As has often been said, Keynes's armchair psychology and attachment to meth- odological individualism (despite his rejection of orthodox microfoundations), led him only to institutional matrices and group psychology (DeMartino 1993:1136; Ingham 1996:258). That is, Keynes imputes group characteristics, expectations, and motivations to three "strategic" economic groups-consumers, investors, and spec- ulators.17 The investor is imputed with a vital role in determining the rate of invest- ment: investors' expectations are "potent," but the future is uncertain. As Lekachman puts it:</page><page sequence="9">Global Mediating Organizations 655 In Keynes this uncertainty engenders a convention and explains an emotion. The convention is reliance on the rule that the future will resemble the present. The present is at least solid and this solidity induces an habitual adjustment which itself influences expectations. Uncertainty about the future also explains the grip which emotion in the form of waves of exaltation achieves over the business community, that pervasive optimism often unrelated to economic events which Keynes dubbed "animal spirits." It is well-known to the financial community as the "state of business confidence." Thus into the last home of rationality in economic affairs, Keynes introduced two interlopers, convention and emotion. (Lekachman 1957:349) If the future is unknown, however, rational and cognitive processes can hardly deal with it well. In Barbalet's view: What is unknown cannot be calculated, dealt with logically or analyzed. But confidence, trust and loyalty allow social agents to act with regard to an unknown and unknowable future. Indeed, . . . only an emotional apprehension of cir- cumstances can do this: thought and reason cannot. (1996:82) Furthermore, Barbalet explains, Keynes's suggestion that agents are most secure about present facts that are incorporated "into the formation of our long-term expectations" (cited in Barbalet 1996:85), demonstrates an interesting paradox. Although confidence (as the inspiration for action) imports the future into the present, "it does so through a psychological mechanism in which the reverse pro- jection, of the present into the future, occurs" (p. 85). This means that "confidence is the basis of action through which pseudo-rationality is created by projection" (p. 86). This is nearly the argument of Dasgupta, who accepts trust as a lubricant to economic decisions, however, and defines it in terms of direct interpersonal relations. Even so, his argument is that trust arises when one's existing knowl- edge of another's disposition, information, abilities, and "available options and their consequences" leads one to trust or "expect" that this other will choose to honor the present commitment in the future (Dasgupta 1988:56). ECONOMIC RATIONALITY AND INDIRECT SOCIAL RELATIONS On the one hand, as just argued, the sociology of trust argues that the claims of rational choice amount to no more than a "pseudo-rationality" dependent on two- way projections of emotions of trust and confidence in order to reduce uncer- tainty. In particular, trust is a fundamental emotion for making allegedly rational but risky decisions about the unknowable future. Failing that, investors avoid tak- ing risks (e.g., by an investment strike or a capital flight). Keynesian insights, however, only led in economics to studies of aggregates of consumers', specula- tors', and investors' emotional states-aka "expectations"-in attempts to use this information for predictions.18 On the other hand, network studies in economic sociology, exemplified by Grano- vetter (1985), "embeds" rational choice in personal networks and trust relations, in an effort to combat methodological individualism's assumption of undersocialized actors atomized from their social ties in an anonymous marketplace. Like Fuku-</page><page sequence="10">656 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 42, Number 4,1999 yama or Dasgupta, trust is nevertheless "in addition" to rational choice; it does not itself make economic rationality partly possible. Moreover, Granovetter's focus on networks and social relations, useful as it is, emphasizes face-to-face interactions such as floor trading, elite social meeting grounds, and overlapping trust relations among directors of major corporations (Shapiro 1987:623). His claim that "most behavior is closely embedded in networks of interpersonal relations" (Granovetter 1985:504) describes strategies to cope with preexisting commodified market exchanges. Though floor traders' need to reduce risk through personal networks in the stock exchange is important, macro issues of profit or speculation are not explained by personal networks. While no one can neglect personal relations, the distinctiveness of economic rationality as a social construction itself and the very existence of large-scale organizations are hardly given in, and cannot be reduced to, the thesis of embedded networks (Calhoun 1992:206-07; Ingham 1996:264, 266-67). The crucial turning point in the argument is to use Keynesian insights about time and emotion with the much stronger case that economic rationality is the product of social organization rather than individual rational choice and that mar- kets are continually shaped and reshaped by bureaucratic corporations (Sjoberg 1997:30). As Ingham (1996:256) puts the matter, Weber showed that capital account- ing is the routine bureaucratic procedure around which the corporation is orga- nized. Such hierarchies (not "markets") are the only way that economic rationality (the "rational choice" as described by economists) can take place. And unlike Keynes,19 Weber never underplayed the conflicts and unequal distribution of power in the capitalist economy. "Rational capitalism requires both rational bureaucratic control to enable the calculation of the returns to capital and the free play of interests, as this is expressed in the power struggle and conflict (not mere competition) of the market" (Ingham 1996:257). Weber stressed that the produc- tion of nonarbitrary prices depends barely on calculations at the margins but mainly on the control of opportunities and inequality of wealth and income (Ingham 1996:257), that is, strategies to reduce uncertainty and vulnerability. Stinchcombe (1990:342) presses this issue of rationality by denying the possibil- ity of rationality as mere "decisions" but as a postulate connected to social struc- tures (organizations) that "gather information and, more or less routinely, make decisions" (1990:342). For Stinchcombe it is only in corporations (and other orga- nizations), where actors in organizational hierarchies deal with their imperfect knowledge (through "satisficing")20 that "information about the uncertain future becomes progressively available in distinct social locations" (p. 2). That is, "the necessary information is not pre-given and merely awaiting discovery by homo economicus; instead it has to be produced and continuously reproduced" (Ingham 1996:264). However, "rather than postulating one rationality for the whole organisa- tion ... we postulate many different rationalities depending on what uncertainty has to be dealt with to get a given subtask done" (Stinchcombe 1990:342).21 But how can the corporation be "confident" that the information is reliable or trustworthy? This is a pervasive problem in organizations, Stinchcombe (1990:343) argues, and accounts for specific ways the social structure "grows" or develops toward gathering the relevant "news." From Stinchcombe's position, the move</page><page sequence="11">Global Mediating Organizations 657 from individual decision making to organizational "rationality" through informa- tion gathering also moves the analysis away from personal networks toward indi- rect social relationships. These are interestingly structured in multiple branches according to sources of information both inside and outside specific organiza- tions.22 That is, economic decision making is understood not as the personalized choices of certain directors but is achieved through impersonal organizations and their interactions with other information-gathering branches that claim predictive capacity through their own organizational methods. Such a move to indirect social relationships, which must be regarded as concep- tually different from direct interpersonal relations, indicates one way to contest reified macroeconomic conceptions of "the market" and sociological system cate- gories as well. In Luhmann's analytical construction of system rationality there are no collective actors or organized pluralities, only individuals who are part of the environment of system connections and dependencies. Although the argument cannot be developed here, in Luhmann the distinction between direct relations and indirect structured relationships between specific corporations is lost from view in system metaphors like autopoiesis. Clearly organizations are not aggrega- tions of individual agents. Equally corporations are neither "intelligent machines" nor corporate personality, for they cannot exist without human agents who are organized in diverse ways, with specific cultures and decision-making proce- dures and particular ways responsibilities are defined (Dan-Cohen 1986; Fisse and Braithwaite 1993:120-22; Sjoberg 1997:28). Luhmann's argument about "system trust" is, nevertheless, partially relevant. Money is defined as one of "the generalised media of communications" (along with authority and power) that is a "conveyor of reduced complexity" (Luhmann 1979:55). This definition confines action to communication, with money seen in functional terms of its effects, rather than as structured "promises to pay," namely, a social relation itself (Ganssmann 1988:305-06; Ingham 1998:6). Both positions held by Luhmann are contentious, however. Consider the relationship he poses: "anyone who trusts the stability of the value of money ... basically assumes that a system is functioning and places his trust in that function, not in people. Such system trust ... [is] easier to acquire than personal trust in new and different people all the time. On the other hand, it is incomparably more difficult to control" (Luhmann 1979:50). Luhmann goes on to argue that when trust in money is institutionalized, an "equivalent-certainty" is created (for those with money), since liquidity reduces the need for information. Other uncertainties can "shatter trust in money as a whole and can initiate a 'flight into material assets"' (pp. 50-51). "While trust may expand the time horizon of a system, loss of trust may make it contract," for if many demands are made simultaneously, the "system must then take deci- sions" and "adopt drastic methods to reduce complexity" (p. 56). Apart from the dubious anthropomorphism and neglect of the social produc- tion of money itself, Luhmann's comparison of system trust with personal trust is conceptually interesting. Personal trust is based on familiarity and rests on emo- tional bonds (the embeddedness thesis), whereas system trust entails taking a conscious risk by "renouncing" further information and taking a "wary indiffer- ence"-hardly nonemotional. Be that as it may, for Luhmann system trust rests on</page><page sequence="12">658 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 42, Number 4,1999 a "presentational" basis (p. 22) and is activated by the "appearance that all is in order" (Lewis and Weigart 1985:974). Such a system view is shared for very different reasons by Habermas (the "steer- ing media" of power and money), a point that cannot be discussed here except to say that it gives too much ground to autonomous cybernetics, in contrast to my later examples of organizational relations. In the system view, "market" or "econ- omy" take on personified or reified out-of-control terms, that is, democratically unaccountable, and, indeed, Luhmann (1988:3) has pessimistically argued more recently that in the central financial markets the "money mechanism [is] applied self-reflexively." But if system trust has a presentational basis, such impression management must be continually created and re-created within and between organizational structures,23 analysis of which could render "the market" less opaque, as I aim to show. Habermas's assumption that rationalization (instru- mental or strategic action oriented to success) is so relentless ("run wild") that its domination is difficult to counter (important though his concept of communica- tive action is, and his recent turn to law: Habermas 1984:284-88, for example; Markell 1997), leaves the potential for specific criticisms of economic rationality in a system vacuum. Calhoun's (1992) contrasting stress on indirect social relations, as increasingly the dominant mode of social integration in modernity, lessens the significance of a concept like system integration, where domination is assumed but not open to crit- ical analysis. System metaphors discourage attempts to focus sociologically on links between indirect and direct relations or to unravel the "mystery" of the inter- personal basis of impersonal exchange, as Ingham (1996:267) puts it. Important work on impersonal trust by Heimer (1976; forthcoming)24 and Shapiro (1987) is critical to making such an attempt. Indirect relationships are those mediated either by markets, administrative organizations, and/or information technology (in Calhoun's description). Person- to-person relations (primary and secondary) are still widespread but are more compartmentalized in modern life, because of the extraordinary growth of corpo- rations in size and number and the consequent increase in interactions between individuals and corporations and between corporations (Calhoun 1992:211; Heimer 1976). Impersonal trust is therefore merely one type of indirect social relationship. In contrast to indirect relations between corporations that may or may not be asymmetrical, we should note that the immense power differential between cor- porations and "natural persons" largely entails individual interactions based on loyalty. Such emotions, even if experienced privately or subjectively, are structured relationships.25 The underrepresentation of interests of natural persons vis-a-vis the corporation and corporate possibilities to evade responsibility or blameworthi- ness through limited liability are themselves formidable contemporary problems (Fisse and Braithwaite 1993:218; Heimer 1976:48-49). But with corporations' bargaining advantages and information resources, it is not feasible for individ- ual actors to reduce uncertainty or vulnerability through impersonal trust (Heimer 1976:2-3).26 Such asymmetrical relations between the individual per- son and the corporation (or "system" and strategic interaction in Habermas's terms) are lost from sight in Luhmann's removal of asymmetry to aggregates</page><page sequence="13">Global Mediating Organizations 659 placing a "system trust" in "functions" or, failing that, feeling confidence in the "environment."27 IMPERSONAL TRUST Impersonal trust relations, Shapiro (1987) argues, are those sources of trust where economic transactions are not embedded in personal social relations. In this less common usage, "trust" is a "kind of social organization" where "principals" invest resources, property, or other assets in another "agent" to act on their behalf for some uncertain, risky future return (Shapiro 1987:625). Far from a distant "sys- tem trust," analysis can therefore focus on specific organizations engaged in the business of trustworthiness. These are relatively symmetrical relations where the agents' behavior is meant to be controlled by principals. They often entail distrust (wary indifference), because it is more common to reduce vulnerability (than uncertainty) through making sure that interests are safeguarded by compensation (guarantees, replacements, or usually money) or by spreading vulnerability. As Heimer (1976:38) says of risk spreading, "distrust is cheap because it is a rationalised business"; however, col- lectivization of risk (particularly insurance) does not reduce risk or punish negli- gence and irresponsibility, it reduces vulnerability through loss compensation, hence the so-called moral hazard. Impersonal "futures institutions" are based on assuring principals that they will guarantee, ensure, or guard against future risk and vulnerability, and the same terms proliferate in their names (trust, fidelity, guardian, assurance, and pruden- tial). Yet while, as Shapiro (1987:628-29) notes, the complexity in these social orga- nizations seems "infinite" with "global exchanges unencumbered by distance, time, commodity or familiarity," there is also considerable potential for abuse. There are temporal niches to amass or exploit investments, the information created can- not be verified by the principals, and even the more trustworthy agents are beset by conflicting claims in different roles. In answer to these structural opportunities for abuse and the consequent vulnerability of the principals who cannot specify, scrutinize, or constrain the agents' performance, many turn to "guardians of trust" (Shapiro 1987:634). Shapiro's question about who then guards the guardians has serious implications for economic rationality. GUARDING THE GUARDIANS? ECONOMIC RATIONALITY UNRAVELED Impersonal guardians of trust perform surveillance operations over trustees or agents of trust. They in turn seek to prove their trustworthiness by simulating personalized forms of trust and social control and by setting up procedural norms and structural constraints (Shapiro 1987:636). Social control may be conducted internally through selection procedures and regulatory watchdogs, or through fiduciary norms. The latter are responses to inherent structural opportunities for abuse and historically arose from the law of corporations (through the law of trusts and the law of agency), which has meant that the central element of any</page><page sequence="14">660 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 42, Number 4,1999 corporation is not employing people but that "others entrust it with their money" (Stinchcombe 1990:201). Fiduciary norms prescribe "disinterestedness, honest dis- closure, and role competence, diligence, duties of care," and the performance of a "reasonable person" (Shapiro 1987:636). Since disinterested self-regulation is often fraught with difficulties, surveillance is sometimes contracted out to "independent third parties" (Shapiro 1987:641). In the case of corporations, the practice of hiring certified accountants to validate finances for investors or creditors developed during the nineteenth century (Strange 1996:136). More recently, bond issuers hire bond-rating firms, like Moody's Inves- tors Services or Standard &amp; Poor's (agencies offering advice to international investors) to assess their risk for potential investors (Shapiro 1987:641). As banks lost their intermediary role in financial assessment, these trust assessors embarked not merely on financial but also longer-term economic assessment, however nar- rowly defined (Sinclair 1994a). Likewise management consultants are hired to assess, clean up, or present and represent the corporation as profitable, lean, and efficient to gain a better reputation for investors.28 In the last few decades, these guardians of trust firms have come to play a major role in international economic matters. In 1984 Moody's did not operate beyond the United States. Ten years later, they had offices in Europe, East Asia, Australia, and elsewhere. Recent mergers, such as the international accountant firms Coo- pers &amp; Lybrand and Price Waterhouse, are making them larger and more subject to conflicts of interest.29 Assurances are increasingly extreme: "Now you can have PERPETUAL access to the world of FIDELITY" advertises a fund manager called Fidelity Perpetual Global Funds in the Australian Financial Review (July 6, 1998), in an attempt to shift clients' emotional attachment from trust to blind faith (Heimer 1976). Such claims to provide complete certainty simply cannot be met. These intensified trust interactions between corporations and corporations are substantially implicated in economic rationality and help to explain the unifor- mity of corporate practices and governments' policies across the globe. Network studies can only describe directors' conformity or conspiracies from, say, gossip during a game of golf or the alleged cronyism so prominent in news stories. In contrast,,impersonal trust interactions between corporations mean that directors are positioned uniformly regardless of personal ties. Moreover, in the impersonal management of trust problems, calculation of risks involves a two-way projection of certainty between the solidity of the present and an unknown future and con- tinual attempts to structure certainty and predictability.30 With rapid increases in the volume of speculation, this has become increasingly contradictory and dan- gerous for corporations (let alone whole populations), entailing multiple attempts to present a trustworthy, sound set of figures to investors. Demands also mount for governments to implement unpopular policies in the hope that they will guar- antee predictability. The alleged discipline of the market imposed or self-imposed on corporations is better explained as the disciplines required by the impersonal trust organizations. These policies are rarely democratically inspired, because, if given an option, few electorates happily accede to increased insecurity simply to provide more "certainty" to corporate actors. Governments are increasingly sub- ject to these disciplines as well.</page><page sequence="15">Global Mediating Organizations 661 As Eatwell (1995) describes the changes in the international financial environ- ment, in 1971, of total foreign exchange transactions, trade and long-term invest- ment comprised 90 percent, whereas speculation was a mere 10 percent. By 1994 this ratio was reversed, with trade/long-term investment about 10 percent and speculation 90 percent. The incentive for deregulation that fostered this extraordi- nary turnaround arose from the end of fixed exchange rates, when extreme fluctu- ations provided opportunities for profit; however, it was reinforced by the need for a hedge against the costs of fluctuating exchange rates. Under Bretton Woods, foreign exchange risk had been borne by the public sector, but once privatized it imposed risk on the private sector, namely, domestic and international bank- ing systems. Deregulation of financial systems worldwide, with controls over exchange and growth of credit abolished, left monetary policy only able to control short-term interest rates. "A global market in monetary instruments was created" (Eatwell 1995:278). While governments are still required to res- cue financial institutions from their own mistakes, thus encouraging further irresponsibility, speculative investment has steadily accumulated (Greider 1997:236-37). All this has led, by the 1990s, as Eatwell (1995:278) says, to a sit- uation in which the "sheer scale of speculative flows can easily overwhelm any government's foreign exchange reserves." Governments are required to maintain credibility to ward against rapid specu- lative swings in the exchange rate. Credibility may be accorded a government that is market friendly, that maintains prudent monetary targets. If not, they will pay a premium on interest rates to finance their programs, or worse, face a financial cri- sis (Eatwell 1995:278). But the determination of credibility rests on the workings of speculative markets, which Keynes described as the ability of each speculator (gambler) to assess not their own estimation of the "credibility" of a country or a corporation but what they believe is the estimation of all speculators about that credibility. Eatwell puts it this way: Since the markets are driven by average opinion about what average opinion will be, an enormous premium is placed on any information or signals which might provide a guide to the swings in average opinion.... These signals have to be simple and clear-cut. Sophisticated multi-dimensional interpretations of the economic data would not provide a clear lead. So the money markets and foreign exchange markets become dominated by simple slogans-larger fiscal deficits lead to higher interest rates, an increased money supply results in higher infla- tion, public expenditure bad, private expenditure good-even when these slo- gans are persistently refuted by events. To these simplistic rules of the game there is added a demand for governments to publish their own financial tar- gets, to show that their policy is couched within a firm financial framework. The main purpose of insisting on [this] is to aid average opinion in guessing how average opinion will expect the government to respond to changing eco- nomic circumstances. (1995:279; my emphasis) Clearly this is a dysfunctional situation that can destroy small open economies. As a description of what occurs on the money markets, the Keynesian assumption of an aggregate of individual investors obscures the origin of these slogans in social control organizations. This is common, from neo-Marxists who agree that finan-</page><page sequence="16">662 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 42, Number 4,1999 cial markets are "moody crowds, not scientists" (Greider 1997:231) to the chief economist of the World Bank who relies on "animal spirits" and "irrational exu- berance" to explain why "instability of beliefs" are "beyond rational explanation" (Stiglitz 1998). Thus a managing director of Moody's (aptly named) argues (with reference to the 1997 East Asian crisis) that "markets are made up of atomised individuals, outside the controls of even the most vigilant governments" (Starr 1997). This is not merely self-serving; it neglects the mediating trust organizations themselves, the private worldwide "authorities" who provide allegedly indepen- dent, reliable ratings that, as Shapiro (1987) suggests, unintentionally give rise to increasing constraints and lack of agency. These private guardians of trust became extraordinarily influential after finan- cial deregulation, being employed for rapid information gathering to ensure cer- tainty for investors and to save investors from the bother of seeking a basis of trust. Ratings themselves are, according to a Moody's analyst, a "strong factor in the market" because they reduce all aspects of a debt obligation "to a letter symbol which is easily understood" (cited in Sinclair 1994b:144). As Shapiro (1987:643) points out, surveillants like Moody's can punish the bond issuers or corporations by disclosing "unfavourable activities," by "refusing to certify financial statements, or issuing a bad rating." But a bad rating from Moody's is frequently forestalled by corporations and governments, since as financial markets become more com- plex, "rating firms are increasingly taking on the role of regulators and rule mak- ers as well as judges. Ratings become negotiable as corporations structure their deals to accommodate the demands of the raters and thereby get the ratings they need" (Shapiro 1987:643). Thus a government will drastically cut public spending, reduce top tax rates, increase the number of unemployed, and aim for zero infla- tion to gain a triple-A rating. In Australia, regional banks have complained for some time (futilely) that U.S.-based credit-rating agencies used the framework of U.S. regional banks in their assessments, despite significant structural differences such as size and loan concentration.31 Only a few years ago the power of a Moody's credit rating became more widely identified. Thus during the Mexican financial crisis in 1994 a New York Times arti- cle titled "Don't mess with Moody's" said, "You could say that we live again in a two-superpower world. There is the U.S. and there is Moody's. The U.S. can destroy a country by leveling it with bombs; Moody's can destroy a country by down- grading its bonds" (cited in Cohen 1996:282). During the East Asian finance crisis, as in the past, criticisms of Moody's and other raters emerged, not about their power so much as their failed predictions. East Asia, Stiglitz (1988) argues, is notable for high savings, government sur- pluses, low inflation, and rapid "accumulation of human capital"-indeed, with textbook "macroeconomic fundamentals" in place, quite the opposite of the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s. Long before the crisis occurred in late 1997, the financial analysts nevertheless knew about the high levels of private debt, weak financial sectors, and so-called lack of transparency, as well as authoritarian ten- dencies (e.g., Indonesia).32 Immediately after the crisis, explanations developed about crony capitalism in a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy that "any problem that existed prior to the onset of the crisis is automatically a cause of the crisis" (Stiglitz</page><page sequence="17">Global Mediating Organizations 663 1998).33 Why, a sociologist might also ask, is this knowledge appropriate now but not yesterday? One of Shapiro's arguments provides potential reasons. As she says, for many so-called independent guardians of trust, a negative report may risk loss of the business relationship. In the case of accounting firms, investment banking firms, and law firms, which depend on very powerful clients for a large part of their rev- enue, "truthful negative revelations are often acts of corporate suicide" (1987:647), and even if bribes are not taken, full candor and independent judgment may be avoided, for fear of being unthanked messengers of bad news. Yet this is not an explanation in the case of bond raters, as Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's are too vast; each rates about U.S.$3 trillion worth of debt, and both have made similar mistakes before (Sinclair 1994a:453). The rating agencies themselves gain no advantage from any particular rating, as they neither lend nor borrow, but any complaints about them may suggest that the corporation, government, or munici- pality has something to hide. A further reason, in my view, illuminates the basis of economic rationality. The most significant clue is that the credit-rating agencies did not downgrade their assessments until after the onset of the East Asian crisis and then faced heavy criticism from investors for being so late in downgrading countries and Asian cor- porations alike.34 Criticism by political leaders was equally intense. Moody's direc- tor responded defensively: "When currencies move and credits deteriorate, who can governments blame-currency traders, irresponsible analysts, call them what you will? . . . In the end, government officials are almost in the same position as direct market participants . . . they are left trying to figure out what the market wants" (Starr 1997). From all this it appears that Moody's confidence in the stabil- ity of the present (with all the correct "fundamentals" providing an illusion of cer- tainty)-the form of pseudorationality described by Barbalet-let them down. Equally, the authoritarianism and alleged crony capitalism of secondary trust rela- tions were, before the crisis in East Asia, part of that very stability of the present that gave "certainty" to investors regardless of well-documented abuses of human rights and were previously justified as different "cultural" practices.35 In an effort to retrieve their reliable trustworthy appearance, Moody's subse- quently engaged in the opposite form of impression management. It exemplifies Shapiro's argument that any effort to reduce uncertainty (positive or negative) seeks to induce trust. A Morgan Stanley report in early 1998 argued that the credit-rating agencies were so "stung" by criticisms of their delayed downgrading that they thereupon became "trigger happy," "and placed many banks on nega- tive credit outlook due to their Asian exposure. In many instances, banks ... responded by aggressively reducing their exposure to Asia. Sound credit propos- als [were] ignored as head offices adopt[ed] a bunker mentality" (Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 1998:4; see also Callick 1998:31). It seems that achievement of sub- stantive rationality is derived from moving between the formal rationality of a textbook checklist of fundamentals to the trust that investment can continue. Once that fails, additional checks are devised and greater information is called for in the form of "transparency" while, amid the prevailing pessimism, the gloomy present is projected into the future regardless of sound proposals.</page><page sequence="18">664 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 42, Number 4,1999 I cannot predict whether new raters will emerge to rate the raters, since the world is too uncertain, and by 1999 Moody's handling of its own crisis seemed to further its prominence.36 Impersonal trust agencies like Moody's manage to regain the appearance that their ratings are to be trusted, partly because memories appear to be short when trust in the future is strengthened by a more profitable present. The dominant debate during the 1998 crisis was for additional guidelines and dis- ciplines in the hope that perfect information from perfect, fully transparent governments and banking systems would provide certainty. No wonder corpo- rations extol the merits of that dubious concept "information society." The search for perfection underpins economic rationality: the belief that predictions could be accurate if only the organizations (governments, corporations, banks) were not deficient (Hodgkinson 1997). Shapiro (1987) suggests that the paradox of proceduralism is that as a spiral of guards to guard the guardians sets in train, there is no room for judgment, discretion, experience, and innovation on the part of the guardian. The irony of this spiral is that it is built on distrust: the more extensive the con- trols and the search for transparent "information," the less room for agency and more likelihood of those so distrusted living down to those expectations, or sim- ply not being able to conduct their actual work (Shapiro 1987:649-50). The "only functional substitutes for trust" are the "strategies that virtually eliminate uncer- tainty and agency" (Shapiro 1987:636). The extension of these "agent-principal relations" is allegedly intended to remove the problem of crony capitalism and uncertainty, but this entails a further rejection of democratically shaped policy. Moreover incipient cronyism is just as likely to emerge in new global forms among those able to take risks and to speculate over the further transparency demanded from the weaker nations and sectors. Reduction of uncertainty through control over the opportunities of the majority also reduces vulnerability-for some-but dangerously only in the short term, as impersonal trust organizations assess the likely risks for future gain. Because we live in an unpredictable world, electorates might prefer the uncer- tainties of democracy to the vain hopes for predictability in the impersonal guard- ians of trust and distrust, except that many in "developed" countries have small, individual stakes in the mutual funds. In this emergent structural pattern, "infor- mation society" is conceptually as much a part of the general vulnerability as sim- plistic remedies like "social trust." With such promotion of impersonal trust, there is no deficit of trust but rather an increased effort to manage unpredictable risks through more impersonal trust. The structural pattern of extensive impersonal trust at the international level further makes difficult the formulation of demo- cratically accountable policy, but a sociological perspective can at least aim to identify some of the problems.

Major work on the sociology of money includes Arrighi 1994; Burns 1998; Dodd 1994; Ganssmann 1988; and Ingham 1984, 1998. All agree about the neglect of finance by sociologists. 3. For a thorough overview of the social capital literature and the numerous criticisms, see Woolcock 1998. Woolcock points to problems of whether social capital is both a source and a benefit, a medium or a message (p. 156). For further criticisms in relation to citizenship, see Barbalet 1999. 4. Seligman (1997:25) argues that indirect trust is really "confidence in the fulfillment of role expectations," but this obscures the problem of trust for future gain and of predic- tions about future risks, as discussed later. 5. This is discussed further on, particularly the difference between loyalty and confi- dence; Barbalet 1996 versus Luhmann 1979. 6. Calhoun (1992:211) has drawn attention to the early sociology literature on primary and secondary relations, in an attempt to emphasize the very different indirect social relations. 7. It is a mark of his neglect of the impersonal trust literature about fiduciary responsibil- ities and of monopoly practices that Fukuyama (1995:197) mentions but skips over the antitrust laws in the United States. Likewise the role of Japanese bureaucracies, espe- cially MITI, and government land reform are avoided. Of course, since the mid-1990s, assessment of Japanese "success" is less the issue than its alleged "failure." 8. This third way is regarded by economic sociologists as a fairly dubious move-see Ing- ham 1996:267; also Stinchcombe (1990) argues, against Oliver Williamson's distinction between hierarchies and markets, that most market contracts save for the simplest ones-for example, the purchase of a few apples-are hierarchical documents. See his chapter 6. 9. In Weber's definition of instrumental rationality, "the actor may use his expectations of the behaviour of external objects and other human beings as 'conditions' or 'means' to achieve the outcome of his own rationally pursued and calculated purposes" (Weber 1978:28; my emphasis). However, this means-end action "is neither affectively deter- mined (and specially not emotionally determined) nor traditional" (Weber 1978:29; my emphasis). Clarke (1982:206) argues that the "clarity" of Weber's four types of social action is illusory not just due to attribution of motives but more because of the dualism between irrational / rational action. As discussed further on, the problem of expecta- tions is their future orientation. 10. See note 11. 11. Lack of alternatives more correctly generates a problem of loyalty; Barbalet (1996) dis- putes Luhmann's overuse of the concept of trust. But equally, confidence may not be involved when, under asymmetric relations and lack of choice, what is probably the only solution is loyalty or, as Heimer (1976) suggests, mistrust, cynicism, or faith. 12. Of course, the modern impersonal "risks" of. pollution, for example, are more like dan- gers, as one can hardly blame oneself or avoid all these risks, or not usually without</page><page sequence="20">666 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 42, Number 4,1999 collective action such as an environmental movement. Usually one has to maintain some "confidence" about facing the dangers of life or be unable to act in the social world at all. 13. Lane (1991:43), probably contentiously, distinguishes the rationality of decision mak- ing from that of scientific investigation or analysis of texts. 14. See note 9 above on Weber's definition of instrumental rationality and expectations. Also, few of us can afford to "take" economic risks that might have a positive outcome. Apart from the problem of discretionary income (which few possess), avoided by neo- classical economics, the individualism of risk taking is a function of the theory. The corporation has a decision-making structure wherein risk taking is decided collectively by those in "responsible" positions entrusted with shareholders' money. Bearing in mind the attractions but bleak probabilities of a flutter at the races or the local lottery, clearly the imputed role of entrepreneurs and speculators is popular. 15. Weber is not alone among classical sociologists here. Only the Chicago school of eco- nomics could imply, to this day, that infants are capable of making exchanges, as Gary Becker does (Bittman and Pixley 1997). 16. Lekachman (1957:345) gives examples of their predictions of postwar underconsump- tion and hence far higher unemployment than actually occurred: the key failing was that forecasters assumed stability in consumers' tastes. He shows the "unfortunate" failing that Keynesian concepts fostered a hope that the available, abundant data on saving, investment, consumption, and income were suitable for statistical generaliza- tion, and "the policy uses of these generalizations were so very tempting" (Lekachman 1957:346). 17. Labor is a neglected category in Keynes, partly because it represents collective conflict and power relations (cf. atomized consumers), and, according to Lekachman, Keynes was relatively unsympathetic toward the plight of the nineteenth-century working class, given his nostalgia for that "golden" era (Lekachman 1957:357). 18. Keynes's major rethinking of economics was later discarded in a return to microfoun- dations and descended into econometrics; Giddens, however, makes an interesting defense of a later "neoclassical" rational expectations theory, for its reflexivity; that is, Keynesian demand management only "works" when few business executives have that government knowledge about macroeconomic trends and about what "lever" to pull to correct "imbalances." Once they all do, the theory is reflexively incorpo- rated into their expectations (Giddens 1987:192). However, Giddens gives too much ground to the methodological individualism of rational expectations theory, and also, as Smithin (1990) points out, even Milton Friedman saw faults in an argu- ment insisting governments be utterly convincing about their determination to reduce inflation, so that expectations could rapidly adjust. The problem in the Thatcher and Reagan governments' implementation of rational expectations theory was that no smooth adjustment took place but rather the severe recessions of 1980- 82 (pp. 52-53). 19. To be fair, Keynes did dispute the "necessity" of inequality assumed in neoclassical economics, with his arguments about the "multiplier effect" and effective demand; but given rational expectations theory, once economic agents are knowledgeable about state demand management, they will subvert it to achieve greater predictability or, rather, reduction of uncertainty, in a situation of risk; Kalecki (1944) outlined the politi- cal aspects of full employment long ago, and by the end of the 1970s full employment was indeed abandoned in many countries in what became a series of attempts to con- trol inflation. Instead of previous hopes for economic democracy, greater inequality</page><page sequence="21">Global Mediating Organizations 667 and increased insecurity for everyone not in a position to take risks has been the result (Pixley 1996). 20. Simon's refutation of rational action, with his concept of bounded rationality wherein people are rarely able to optimize but may manage to satisfice; reaffirmed against Becker in Simon 1993. A useful description is in Lane 1991:47. 21. Stinchcombe argues the following: Organizations grow social structures to handle decisions by creeping toward infor- mation about the main sources of uncertainty that matter to the organization.... This is ... not one big uncertainty, but lots of different uncertainties, and one collects the latest news about them in very different ways. Consequently one has to build social structures to keep tabs on different parts of the environment, to respond on the very different time scales that these different uncertainties are uncertain on, to be compe- tent to evaluate the risks as the news comes in, and so on. (1990:345) 22. One example that many know well is also apt. Stinchcombe (1990) shows that universi- ties are in the business of making money (via state or private fees) through gaining lots of student "throughput," but the reputation of the university depends on renting aca- demics' reputation as "cutting edge" researchers (not teachers). The source of informa- tion to attempt prediction may lie in performance indicators and citation indexes but much more in academics' external reputation from referees from other universities. See chapter 9, "University Administration of Research Space and Teaching Loads: Manag- ers Who Do Not Know What Their Workers Are Doing." 23. Luhmann does draw on Erving Goffman in his Trust and Power (1979). 24. Heimer's unpublished paper has been revised and is forthcoming. 25. See Barbalet 1996-97:484. Albert Hirschman's (1970) spirited defense of "exit" and "voice" illustrates the importance of collective action in most cases of powerlessness. Despite his outline of the counterproductive nature of loyalty for the corporation, the denial of avenues for voice is still the corporate preference. 26. Heimer (1976) suggests in these asymmetrical cases that risks simply have to be weighed and that decisions to interact largely depend on how much individual actors need what the corporate actor has, for example, employment prospects. Faith or cyni- cism may be involved (if vulnerability, even though present, is not perceived), depend- ing on whether agents' intentions are benevolent or malevolent. When vulnerability and uncertainty are subjectively perceived, but in cases in which there is no outside actor to direct or negotiate such concerns, and no right whatever to alter the behavior of the agent, the relation is either confidence or mistrust. Other situations, for example, where there is an outside actor to direct one's concerns, resemble "legal trust" (Heimer 1976:48-49). Specific examples include an ombudsman, class action, and industrial and appeals tribunals, which are variously available in some countries (e.g., Australia, Ger- many, Sweden). 27. Barbalet (forthcoming) points out that this is a shift to loyalty in the realm of organiza- tion. To be sure, Luhmann does state that "political and economic liberalism attempts to shift expectations" through the assumption of freedom of choice and individual responsibility to decide between trust and mistrust, whether for the political system or for employers. This neglects attribution problems and "asymmetric relations between system and environment" (Luhmann 1988:99). 28. The titles of books on consultancy firms are increasingly alarmist: O'Shea and Madi- gan's Dangerous Company: The Consulting Powerhouses and the Businesses They Save and Ruin (1997); Micklethwait and Wooldridge's The Witch Doctors: What the Management</page><page sequence="22">668 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 42, Number 4,1999 Gurus Are Saying (1997). Many are linked to the big accountancy firms, for example, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consultancy. 29. "Auditors May Be Called to Account," Australian Financial Review, January 2, 1998, which cites cases in which one accountancy firm may audit opposing corporations such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi. More recently still, the Big Five have not just gotten big- ger, gone global, but also have now turned into "all-purpose conglomerates" for the "demanding multinationals," who want not just accountants and auditors at hand but also lawyers, consultants, corporate advisers, actuaries, and corporate financiers: "One-Stop Shop Fills the Bill," Australian Financial Review, April 13, 1999. Clarke, Dean, and Oliver (1997) show how waves of litigation against the multinational accountancy firms in the 1980s cannot reveal the structural problems wrought by Accounting Stan- dards, which have resulted in a "fatal attrition of professional judgement" and of the requirement to show a "true and fair view" of a corporation's finances. As they say, "creative accounting" merely complies with Accounting Standards, and many corpo- rate collapses in Australia and elsewhere occurred despite full compliance, not neces- sarily from "feral accounting" that misleads deliberately (pp. 232-50). 30. That is, as Weber argued, through control of opportunities, and here political beliefs about the "natural rate" of inflation become policies with this aim (Pixley 1993), since greater "certainty" about low inflation is derived from textbook assumptions about a "necessary" rate of unemployed to threaten wages, as well as through organizations that are attracted, as Stinchcombe says, to the relevant information (thus the emer- gence of credit-rating agencies). It seems, as I note later, that achievement of substan- tive rationality is derived from moving between the formal rationality of a textbook checklist of "fundamentals" to a trust that investment can continue (or not). 31. Personal correspondence, John Hobson, analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Hong Kong, June 18, 1998. Sinclair (1994a) tells a similar story about Detroit. 32. Stiglitz also argues that "no one can draw a parallel between leaders like President Suharto, who oversaw a decline in the poverty rate from 64 percent in 1975 to 11 per- cent in 1995, and Mobuto Sese Seko, who looted Zaire, leaving its per capita income at the end of his reign at half of the level it was when he began" (1998:2). 33. Stiglitz suggests that the major disaster for East Asian countries was to encourage short-term capital flows ("hot money"). Financial journalists in the mainstream press argued the following at that time: The US and its vassal, the International Monetary Fund, should abandon their cam- paign to pressure countries with immature financial systems to open their capital accounts, merely to provide the developed countries' banks and pension funds with a bigger playground in which to play their economically destructive flavour of the month/pariah of the year game. (Gittins 1998) 34. Stiglitz (1998:5) notes the credit-rating agencies' tardiness as evidence of "irrational exuberance/ irrational pessimism" among investors. 35. In the "West" much nonsense was written in the 1980s complaining about alleged Eurocentrism on the part of Amnesty International and similar bodies in presuming to defend human rights against "different" cultural practices. Some of this pseudo- opposition to Eurocentrism tended to neglect criticizing the use of Western methods of torture in Western types of prisons employing Western technology. Such talk is now unraveling painfully in Indonesia, for example, but again, memories are very short and the first casualty is likely to be the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) 1997 Letter of Intent, which included the demand that the Indonesian government cease providing</page><page sequence="23">Global Mediating Organizations 669 subsidies on rice and cooking oil. The IMF's intention was to appease Western inves- tors by restoring "fundamentals." Indonesia has virtually no other welfare provision, and the drastic curtailment of human rights entailed in conceding to this demand led to immediate outbreaks of violence against minorities and women. 36. Personal communication, Timothy Sinclair, September 1998. As Sinclair (1994b:138) points out, bond raters make judgments on the "future ability and willingness of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest on a security over the life of the instrument." They look at the audited financial statements and media reports, they gain information from the issuer and also from "disgruntled former employees," and finally vote in a rating committee (Sinclair 1994b:139-40). A common criticism in the financial markets is that they only "look at creditworthiness in historical terms" (cited in Sinclair 1994b:149), as though there actually were any other way.
