<plain_text><page sequence="1">'DE HISTORIA GIGANTUM': THEOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY BEFORE RABELAIS By WALTER E. STEPHENS Nowadays we define Giants as persons suffering from scientifically defined physiological disorders. Since Western culture has a short memory for obsolete scientific discourse, however, the simplicity of our contemporary understanding of gigantism makes it difficult for us to understand previous attitudes toward Giants, especially as expressed in literature. As Donald Frame has remarked, * When most Western readers think of giants in literature, they think of Rabe lais and Swift; when they think of Rabelais and Swift, they think of giants.'1 However, the actual importance of Rabelais and Swift would be seriously mis represented were we to imagine them as exponents of the traditional Western attitude toward Giants and gigantism. What is more, Rabelais, who is the source of most early modern speculation about Giants, is a particularly proble matic case. His combination of agile parodie wit and extreme philosophical and theological literacy is only beginning to be satisfactorily understood. Thus his treatment of gigantological themes has until now been almost completely misrepresented because of an insufficient understanding of the cultural signifi cance of gigantism before his time. In fact, he is at least two removes from a coherent tradition of gigantological discourse running from the Old Testament through Judaic and patristic commentary and historiography, straight into the era of humanism. While the scope of this article will not permit an intensive analysis of Rabelais' own gigantology, an analysis of the two traditions upon which he depended will implicitly demonstrate the inadequacy of the conven tional wisdom which sees Pantagruel and Gargantua as a direct outgrowth of medieval French folklore, the Grandes chronicques, and the literary romances of Pulci and Folengo.2 Along the way, it should provide an understanding of the 1 D. M. Frame, Fran?ois Rabelais: A Study (New York 1977) 144. Throughout the present study, I shall use 'Giant' as a proper name for a supposed race of 'hominids' or inferior humans as defined by the theological tradition. Similarly, instead of the usual term 'gian tism' I shall use 'gigantism,' in accordance with the erudite background of the concept. 2 The notion that Rabelais' gigantology can be entirely accounted for in terms of the Grandes chronicques, reflections of medieval French folklore in mystery plays, and Rabelais' own references to the Chronicques, Pulci's Morgante, and Folengo's Baldus (usually cited inaccurately as Le Maccheronee, of which it is only a part), was synthesized by Abel Lefranc in the Edition critique ( uvres de Fran?ois Rabelais 1 [Paris 1912] xviiiff.). It has not been challenged by even the best Rabelaisian scholars: see the introductions to the Droz editions of Pantagruel and Gargantua (Textes Litt?raires Fran?ais 2 [Geneva 19652, 1970] 163), by V. L. Saulnier and M. A. Screech, respectively, esp. Saulnier ix-xiii nn.

Crucial to an understanding of gigantology before Rabelais is an author who, until very recently, was practically unknown to all but a handful of medieval ists: Giovanni Nanni (1432?-1502), notorious as Johannes Annius Viterbiensis or Annius of Viterbo, and the b?te noire of conscientious philologists until the early 1700s.3 In his most important work, a series of forged chronicles attrib uted to about a dozen Babylonian, Egyptian, Persian, Hebraic, Greek, and Latin authors, Annius set out to rewrite the history of the world from Noah's flood down to the time of Charlemagne. One of the most important effects of this collection, which saw eighteen or more editions in the original Latin ' trans lations ' and had an extremely wide influence on Western European historiog raphers down through the early 1600s, was Annius' complete redefinition of the anthropological and theological category of the Giant as it had been elaborated in the previous Judaeo-Christian tradition.4 In order to understand the cultural impact of Annius' Commentarla super opera diversorum auctorum de antiquitati bus loquentium (1498), which I shall examine more closely in the second part of this article, it will be necessary to survey the coherent tradition of Judaeo Christian speculation which he superseded and (from a modern standpoint) destroyed. Ultimately, Annius' redefinition of the Giant both prepared and pre figured the scientific redefinition of the past century or so, with important conse quences not only for an isolated literary theme but for Biblical studies in general. I. Traditional Judaeo-Christian Gigantology 'Nemrod gigas diaboli typum expressit, qui superbo appetitu culmen divinae celsitudinis appetivit . . . ' (Isidore of Seville, Alleg?ri?? quaedam Scripturae Sacrae 17 [PL 83.103 A12ff.]). There is a striking confirmation of the newness of the endocrinological defi nition of gigantism in the evolution of the article 'Giant' in the Encyclopaedia Saulnier's intro. to Pantagruel (Paris 1962), esp. vi-x. I first attacked the traditional view in my doctoral dissertation, 'Berosus Chaldaeus': Counterfeit and Fictive Editors of the Early Sixteenth Century (Cornell: DAI 40 [1980] 4584A) 271-306, on which parts of this article are based. 3 For bibliography on Annius, see Stephens, Berosus 1-20 nn. and passim. The Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche has recently dedicated a volume to Annius: Annio da Viterbo: Documenti e Ricerche (Contributi alla Storia degli Studi Etruschi ed Italici 1 [Rome 1981]), containing an early work, Annius' Viterbiae hist?ri?? epitoma [sic], ed. Giovanni Baffioni, 17-251, and a study by Paola Mattiangeli, 'Annio da Viterbo ispiratore di cicli pittorici, ' 257-339. Both parts, esp. the latter, have been criticized on methodological grounds by Edoardo Fumagalli in Aevum 56 (1982) 547-53. 4 On the editions of Annius' pseudo-authors, see Stephens, Berosus 347-49 for a verified list.

Further confirmation can be had in the pages of a source alleged by the Britannica, Launois and Roy's ?tudes biologiques sur les g?ants5 To a reader of the 1980s it may come as something of a shock to see the foremost general encyclopedia indulging in serious discussions of 'the conception of giants, as special races distinct from mankind,' or cautiously affirming that 'so far as can be judged from actual remains, it does not appear that giants, in the sense of tribes of altogether superhuman stature, ever existed, or that the men of ancient times were on the whole taller than those now living. ' And we are so accustomed to the Giant as a denizen of Paul Bunyanesque tales by Rabelais and other yarnspinners, that we ma}^ be surprised by references to 'scientific' discussions like this one: tooth weighing 4f lb. and a thigh-bone 17 ft. long having been found in New England in 1712 (they were probably mastodon) Dr. Increase Mather thereupon communicated to the Royal Society of London his theory of the existence of men of prodigious stature in the antediluvian world. ' In point of fact, the Britannica errs on the side of modernity by im plicitly crediting Mather with a theory for which, as further analysis will show, he was far from being the first or foremost exponent. Poor Dr. Mather was only offering his confirmation, not of a 'theory' in the modern sense of the word, but of a 'fact' which he and most of his contemporaries earnestly wished to believe. More importantly, their seemingly trivial concern had immediate and profound importance in their eyes as empirical validation of a much more fundamental (and fundamentalist) credo, i.e., as proof of the literal veracity of the Old Testament. To an eighteenth-century theologian, as we shall see, a 'proof of the existence of antediluvian Giants was badly needed in order to reinforce the story of Noah's Flood against the rationalistic questioning which had once been entertained and piously repulsed by devout Christians, but was now being seriously advanced by much more adventurous skeptics.

If the existence of antediluvian Giants could be proved, perhaps a universal flood was still defensible.6 The Britannica evidence is significant in that it marks the approximate period at which Christian theologians and philosophers had to admit that they could no longer hope to explain away empirical evidence and continue to take for granted the existence of Giants several times larger than human beings, or use the Giants as proof of the veracity of the flood-story of Genesis or the entire Old Testament. In the twelfth century, Honorius Augustodunensis had had no such problem, remarking laconically that ' Gigantes orti sunt, quorum statura erat quindecim vei triginta cubitorum' (PL 172.165). Gigantological specu lation by Christian theologians centered on the Old Testament, but concern with the Giants was nourished by and returned expectantly to both secular literature and something that can only be called the archaeological impulse. Until the advent of systematic archaeological and anthropometrical methods, a combination of Biblical and non-Biblical literature, folklore, and occasional, misunderstood discoveries of fossil bones provided the warp for all gigantology.7 The literary sources of theologians, discussions they found in ancient scien tists, travelers and anecdotists, rested in turn on a fund of folklore and my thology. Moreover, a gigantologist writing at any time could observe in his contem poraries a parallel literary and folkloric elaboration of the Giant-theme. For instance, Giants sometimes played significant roles in the foundation legends of European cities, which claimed them as 'mascots' and preserved them in effigy: 'Thus London had Gog and Magog, whose effigies (14 ft. high) still stand in the Guild Hall. . . . Antwerp had her Antigonus, 40 ft. high; Douai had Gayant, 22 ft. high, and so on' (Britannica 1911). Between truly folkloric Giants and those of literary romance, it is often hard to decide which came first, but the essential point is surely that the influences traveled in both di rections. To take an example, the Grandes chronicques are at least as much a product of literary romance as of proper folklore, especially in their use of Arthurian apparatus. In the Chronicques as in Arthurian literature, the line between popular and erudite gigantology at any given moment was extremely imprecise. In a sense, we automatically misrepresent any such motif by labeling it either popular or erudite, since there is substantial agreement among written texts, no matter to what tradition their overall tone may appear to belong.8 6 See . 31 below; S. G. Goodrich, A History of AU Nations, from the Earliest Periods to the Present Time ... I (Auburn and Cincinnati 1852) 66-68. See also Melville's Moby Dick, chap. 104. 7 See n. 31 below. 8 In the Grandes chronicques, Merlin creates Grandgousier and Galamelle, the parents of Gargantua; Gargantua performs 'merveilleux faictz d'armes' for Arthur. All gigantology is ultimately folkloric, and nearly all of it eventually became erudite. Another example:</page><page sequence="5">'de historia gigantum' 47 In fact, we shall find that it is helpful only to speak of traditional or untraditional Giants, those which fit or clash with the consensus expressed by the folklore, theology, and literature of a given time. Until 1498, that consensus is extremely uniform. No matter how far into the past we delve, the consensus about Giants is extremely unfavorable to them, or rather, to quote Frame again, ' unkind. ' When reading in Homer of 'the Cyclopes and the wild tribes of the Giants/ or of the adventures of Odysseus in the cave of Polyphemus (Homer, Odyss., VII.206; IX), we seem to come into view of dim traditions, exaggerated through the mist of ages, of pre-Hellenic barbarians, godless, cannibal, skin-clothed, hurling huge stones in their rude warfare. Giant-legends of this class are common in Europe and Asia, where the big and stupid giants have often every token of uncouth native barbarians, exaggerated into monsters in the legends of the later tribes who dispossessed and slew them.9 For whatever reasons (primal fear of the foreigner, Oedipal fear of the father, a people's political rationalization of its own atrocities, etc.), traditional Giants were portrayed as evil in every way. Even the exceptions to this rule seem to be rule-confirming exceptions. Perhaps the best-known 'good' Giant before Rabelais' time is Pulci's Morgante. However, Morgante was originally a 'fiero gigante, ' indeed ' assai pi? fiero ' than his two companions, and was converted by Orlando to Christianity only after having had a providential dream (1.20, 26, 40). Indeed, Cervantes tells us that Don Quixote 'dec?a mucho bien del gigante Morgante, porque, con ser de aquella generaci?n gigantea, que todos son in his translation of the Annian Berosus, Francesco Sansovino quotes what he calls a Tuscan folksaying: 'Et hebbi voglia anch'io d'esser gigante / Vedi che sette braccia sono a punto' (Le antichit? di Beroso Caldeo Sacerdote. Et d'altri Scrittori, cos? Hebrei, come Greci, et La tini . . . [Venice 1583] fol. 2r). However, the lines reproduce almost exactly Luigi Pulci's Morgante, 18.113.6-8: 'Ed ebbi voglia anco io d'esser gigante, / Poi mi penti' quando al mezzo fu' giunto, / Vedi che sette braccia sono a punto.' These lines rely on the erudite commonplace mentioned above, that Giants were 15 cubits tall. The commonplace derives in turn from Genesis 7.20, which asserts that the floodwaters rose 'Quindecim cubitis al tior . . . super montes, quos operuerat. ' Flavius Josephus says that the 15-cubit depth was necessary 'ne plurimos fugae occasio liberaret'; he also attributes the building of the Tower of Babel to a lingering fear that God might send another Flood (Antiquitates Judaicae 1. 89, 144; cf. The Latin Josephus, ed. F. Blatt [Aarsskrift for Aarhus Universitet XXX.l, Hu manistisk Serie, no. 44; Copenhagen 1958] 1. 134,137-38. Henceforth this work will be quoted as AJ, with Blatt's page numbers in parentheses, e.g., AJ 1.89 [Blatt 134]). 9 Britannica, 1878 and 1911. (Most of this material was eliminated in subsequent editions.) Frame, Rabelais 144, gives a similar and more complete list of Giants in literature. However, he, like most Rabelaisian scholars, comes to a conclusion with which I take issue on pp. 84-89, namely, that the dichotomy between Rabelais' presentation of his Giant protagonists and his presentation of all other Giants is consistent only in its inconsistency.</page><page sequence="6">48 TRADITIO soberbios y descomedidos, ?l solo era afable y bien criado/10 The relationship of Orlando and Morgante, based on Morgante's conversion, is merely an instance of the paradoxical logic which allows and even valorizes unnatural friendships and alliances in folktales. The divine intervention which causes the conversion of a 'fiero gigante' not only saves the Giant, but also enhances Orlando's pres tige and vindicates his decision to leave behind the intrigues of Carlo Magno's court. A more usual encounter between paladin and Giant would be that of Astolfo with the cannibal Caligorante, a 'gigante smisurato' in Orlando furioso (15.49-62). Purely fictive Giants like Morgante and Caligorante in .Italian literary romance are at least in part dependent on the Giants of Dante in the Divine Comedy. Dante's Giants are those of folklore, but of a folklore redefined by Judaeo Christian theologians of Antiquity and the Middle Ages and rediffused among both erudite and ignorant audiences. They are the Giants of the Bible, and of syncretic, Christianizing mythographers who sought, for example, to reconcile pagan accounts of the revolt of the Titans with the Hebrew story of Babel. Nimrod, whom Augustine and most other commentators called a gigas, is thus the centerpiece of Dante's exposition. Although they are buried to the waist, Nimrod and the other Giants are so immense that Dante first mistakes them for towers in the distance (Inf 31.20-45). Nimrod measures thirty spans, 'more than three tall Frisians,' from his neck to his waist (Inf. 31.61-66), a stature which coincides exactly with the thirty cubits (sixty spans) mentioned by Honor ius. Dante rejoices that Nature has ceased making such creatures, and his words reflect the theological concept of the Giant as a mere ' hominid, ' rather than a true human being. Natura certo, quando lasci? Tarte Di s? fatti animali, assai f? bene, Per torre tali essecutori a Marte. E s'ella d'elefanti e di balene Non si pente, chi guarda sottilmente Pi? giusta e pi? discreta la ne tene; Ch? dove argomento de la mente S'aggiunge al mal volere e a la possa, Nessun riparo vi pu? far la gente. (Inf. 31.49-57) The Giants of theology were not really human (gente), but rather 'ammalia' with reasoning powers.11 Their special position in Creation was reflected by 10 Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha 1.1 (ed. Francisco Rodr?guez Marin [Madrid 1964] 1.57; emphasis mine). 11 See C. H. Grandgent's preface to Inferno 31 in his edition of the Divine Comedy (Boston 1933) 274-76. I should note again that 'animale' in v. 50 does not mean 'bestia' (beast) but is understood etymologically (i.e., as 'being'), as in Inf. 5.88, etc.</page><page sequence="7">'de historia gigantum' 49 another quality which distinguished them from both humans and brute beasts: an inveterate propensity for evil (mal volere) which foreclosed the hope of sal vation held out to ordinary fallen men. Although Dante mentions their ability to reason (to employ Vargomento de la mente), he and previous traditional theological thinkers conceived of Giants as uniformly stupid. Indeed, Dante's Vergil calls Nimrod 'anima sciocca,' precisely translating the words of the Book of Baruch, as quoted by Augustine in the City of God: Ibi fuerunt gigantes nominati illi, qui ab initio fuerunt, statura magna, scientes bellum. Non hos elegit Dominus, ?eque viam disciplinae invenerunt, propterea perierunt; et quoniam non habuerunt sapientiam, interierunt propter suam insipientiam.12 The Giants had scientia, or knowledge, but they could not transcend this purely technical ability and arrive at sapientia or wisdom. Their insipientia or scioc chezza led to what Vergil here calls their mal coto (Inf 31.77) ? 'bad thinking' manifested as tracotanza or presumption, the desire to test themselves against their Maker. ' "Questo superbo [Ephialtes] volle essere sperto / Di sua potenza contra al sommo Giove,'" says Vergil (Inf. 31.91-92), echoing Flavius Josephus' notion that the antediluvian Giants 'omne bonum despicientes propter confi dentiam fortitudinis similia his qui dicti sunta Graecis gigantes perpetrasse.'13 Although they differed from ordinary humans, however, the Giants were not mere monsters. When Dante expresses a desire to see Briareus, Vergil's response again coincides with traditional lore by implicitly denying the Giant's monstros ity. Dante's reference to Briareus as smisurato and his implied desire to see the hundred hands provoke Vergil's declaration that even Briareus, though huge and fierce, is a normally-proportioned ' hominid ' : ' Quel che tu vuo' veder, pi? l? ? molto / ed ? legato e fatto come questo [Ephialtes], / salvo che pi? feroce par nel volto' (Inf. 31.103-5). Since Ephialtes is two-armed (v. 87), Vergil effectively denies that any Giants, even Briareus, were ever physiologically 'inhuman.' Their inhumanity was purely a matter of temperament. Indeed, when Dante's wish to see Briareus is granted (in Purg. 12.28-30), Briareus' 'monstrosity,' like that of Satan and Nimrod, is purely anthropomorphic: his pride. The Giants of the Old Testament are uniformly portrayed as evil because they were the opponents of the Israelites. The most famous is, of course, Goliath of 12 Baruch 3.26-28, quoted in Civ. Dei, 15.23. Henceforth, all quotations are taken from Sancti Aurelii Augustini, De Civitate Dei, edd. . Dombart and A. Kalb (GGL 47-48). Sam ple citation: [II 484] = vol. 48, p. 484.

But the classical Biblical loci for the 'mon strous' stature of Giants centered upon the struggle of the Children of Israel to wrest the Promised Land away from the enormous Canaanites who already inhabited it. When Moses sent spies into the land of Canaan, they returned describing it as a ' land of milk and honey, ' sed cultores fortissimos habet, et urbes grandes atque muratas. Stirpem Enac vidimis ibi. . . . Nequ?quam ad hunc populum valemus ascendere, quia fortior nobis est. ... Ibi vidimus monstra quaedam filiorum Enac de genere giganteo, quibus comparati, quasi locustae videbamur. (Num. 13. 28-34) The question of the Giants arose again when, after forty years of wandering in the desert, the Israelites prepared themselves for another assault on the Canaanites. The Enakim recur in God's injunction against attacking the Moa bites: 'Emim primi fuerunt habitatores eius, populus magnus, et validus, et tarn excelsus ut de Enacim stirpe, quasi gigantes crederentur, et essent similes filiorum Enacim' (Deut. 2.10-11). Again, when God promises his aid to the Israelites, He proclaims: Audi, Israel: Tu transgredieris hodie Iordanem,ut possideas nationes m?ximas et fortiores te, civitates ingentes, et ad caelum usque muratas, populum magnum atque sublimem, filios Enacim, quos ipse vidisti et audisti, quibus nullus potest ex adverso resistere. (Deut. 9.1-2) The land of the sons of Ammon had once been inhabited by a similar race: Terra gigantum reputata est: et in ipsa olim habitaverunt gigantes, quos Ammonitae vocant Zomzommim, populus magnus, et multus, et procerae longitudinis, sicut Enacim, quos delevit Dominus a facie eorum . . . (Deut. 2.20-21) The land of Bashan was also inhabited by Giants, so much so that ' cuneta . . . Basan vocatur terra gigantum' (Deut. 3.13). These accounts imply that many of the Canaanite Giants were no longer alive in Moses' day. Indeed, the most famous and problematic Giants of all were those who had lived before Noah's Flood. For most Christian writers, the antediluvian Giants were the Giants par excellence. For example, Freculphus of Lisieux (|852/3) says of the Giants that 'fuisse etiam post diluvium quosdam, sed plures antea, hist?rica traditione [i.e., the Bible] deprehendimus ' (Chronicon 1.14; PL 106.927c5ff.). Judaeo-Christian gigantology devoted most of its energies to explicating one verse of the Book of Genesis, which the Vulgate renders thus: ' Gigantes autem erant super terram in diebus illis: postquam enim ingressi sunt filii Dei ad filias hominum, illaeque genuerunt, isti sunt potentes a saeculo viri famosi' (Gen. 6.4). Now the importance of this verse is that it directly precedes the verses (5-7) in which Yahweh repents of having created mankind, ' quod multa malitia</page><page sequence="9">'de historia gigantum' 51 hominum esset in terra, et cuneta cogitatio cordis intenta esset ad malum omni tempore,' and thus decides to destroy the world in a flood. The proximity of these verses led early commentators to speculate that the Giants had had a significant role in the vast increase of evil-doing which made Yahweh decide to destroy the world. Cassiodorus (ca. 485-ca. 580) wrote that 'Diluvium autem factum est propter gigantum nimiam feritatem, qui corporis magnitudine parique animi saevitia praevalentes, humanitatis jus omne confuderant' (Chronicon, Praefatio: PL 69.1215-16). According to Hugh of St. Cher (ca. 1200-63), Jewish commentators maintain that the Flood was sent expressly to destroy the Giants.14 Freculphus writes that postdiluvian Giants, like their antediluvian ancestors, died because they offended God: 'et alii [gigantes] de progenie Noe exorti sunt, qui omne bonum despicientes propter confidentiam fortitudinis, et pulchritudinem corporis, Dominum irritantes, perierunt.'15 So, too, Augustine wrote: Quos [i.e., gigantes] propterea creare piac?it Creatori, ut etiam hinc osten deretur non solum pulchritudines, uerum etiam magnitudines et fortitudines corporum non magni pendendas esse sapienti, qui spiritalibus atque inmor talibus longe melioribus atque firmioribus et bonorum propriis, non bonorum malorumque communibus beatificatur bonis. (Civ. Dei 15.23 [II 492]) It remained to explain how and why the Giants could have been so evil as to provoke the destruction of all Creation. Somewhat like Vico after them, early commentators sought to explain the evil nature of the Giants by explaining their origin, since they also believed that 'natura di cose altro non ? che nascimento di esse in certi tempi e con certe guise.'16 Genesis did not give an explicit date (tempo) for the Giants' origin, although it indicated that they were very ancient 'mighty men which were of old.' In contrast, the manner (guisa) of the Giants' origin seemed to be re counted in disturbing and deceptively simple terms: the fornication of the 'sons of God ' with the ' daughters of men. ' Cumque coepissent homines multiplican super terram, et filias procr?assent, videntes filii Dei filias hominum quod essent pulchrae, acceperunt sibi uxores ex omnibus, quas elegerant. Dixitque Deus: Non permanebit spiritus meus in homine in aeternum, quia caro est: eruntque dies illius centum viginti annorum. (Gen. 6.1-3) 14 Hugonis de Sancto Charo Opera (Lyon 1669) 1.9. The book of Wisdom implies the same idea: 'Sed ab initio cum p?rirent superbi gigantes, / Spes orbis terrarum ad ratem confugiens, / Remisit saeculo semen nativitatis quae manu tua erat gubernata' (14.6). 15 Freculphus, Chronicon 1.14 (PL 106.927c7-10). The italicized words are a quotation from Josephus (see above, p. 49). 16 Giambattista Vico, Principi di scienza nuova, ed. F. Nicolini (Milan 1953; repr. Turin 1976) 1.76; cf. 1.124 (i.e., capoversi 147, 346).</page><page sequence="10">52 TRADITIO Augustine and others interpreted this last proclamation to mean Yahweh hoc . . . dixisse, cum circa finem quingentorum annorum esset Noe, id est quadringentos octaginta uitae annos ageret . . . sescentensimo quippe anno uitae Noe, secundo mense factum est diluuium [Gen. 7.11]; ac sic centum uiginti anni praedicti sunt futuri uitae hominum periturorum, quibus transactis diluuio delerentur. (Civ. Dei 15.24 [II 492]) This interpretation could be confidently advanced because, in context, Yahweh's words followed directly after the verses describing the fornication of the 'sons of God, ' and so seemed to reflect his anger, not only at human evil in general, but specifically at this fornication. It was thus possible to read Genesis 6.1-7 as a sequence of related events: the ' sons of God ' fornicated with the ' daughters of men'; the Giants came into being; Yahweh was offended both by the fornica tion and by the evil which the Giants committed, and thus decided to destroy the world.17 As often happened, the literal meaning of the passage in Scripture posed a serious problem of identification. Since the historical truth of the passage could not be doubted, exactly who were the 'sons of God' and the 'daughters of men'? Jewish commentators, including Philo and Josephus, followed the example of the apocryphal Book of Enoch, and construed the coupling of the 'sons of God' with the 'daughters of men' to mean that some of the angels had coupled with mortal women. In fact, as Augustine pointed out (Civ. Dei 15.23 [II 492]), some texts read angeli Dei rather than filii Dei. Some Christian writers, notably Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and Lactan tius, concurred with the Jewish tradition, but from the time of Augustine onward, Christians spurned these ' fables, ' as he called them, and insisted that the fathers of the Giants had to be mortal men.18 Augustine insisted that spiritual and carnal beings cannot have sexual congress with each other, but he also rejected the Jewish solution because it implies a second fall of the angels, long after the fall of man.

It was held that in the days before the Flood, there were two ' races ' of men, whose natures were all but congenital. Since Cain had com mitted the first murder, and since his descendant Lamech was damned ' seventy and seven fold ' and since, as Augustine and other writers assure us, ' the whole of Cain's posterity was destroyed in the deluge' his 'race' was seen as irredeem ably evil.20 Conversely, Seth, whose name means 'resurrection,' was called a God-given 'semen aliud pro Abel' by his father (Gen. 4.25). Furthermore, Seth's son Enos may have been the first to pray: 'iste coepit invocare nomen Domini' (Gen. 4.26). As a result, says Augustine, 'there died in the deluge none of those mentioned in the sacred Scripture as descended from Seth. '21 The moral opposition between the descendants of Adam's two sons, which is already implied in the genealogies of the book of Genesis, was so basic that Augustine used it to structure the City of God, calling Cain the architect of the City of Man (Gen. 4.17 says that Cain built a city). Thus it seemed logical to the majority of Christian writers that the filii Dei should be those 'qui secundum carnem de Seth propagati sunt,' and thence that 'filii Dei, qui et angeli Dei dicti sunt, filiabus hominum, hoc est secundum hominem uiuentium, misceren tur: filii scilicet Seth [filiabus] Cain. '22 The crime of the filii Dei, therefore, was not mere fornication, but rather miscegenation; although the filiae hominum had the same ultimate ancestry as their husbands, Cain's crime and his banish ment effectively created two races, and thus a sexual taboo against intermar riage.23 19 Chronicon 1.14 (PL 106.927b6-11); cf. Civ. Dei 15.23 (II 489) and 3.5 (I 68). In the Genealogia deorum gentilium 4.68, Boccaccio dismisses Josephus' angels-theory as 'ridicu lum' (ed. V. Romano [Scrittori d'Italia 200-201; Bari 1951] 1.225). 20 Civ. Dei 15.20 (II 483); Genesis 4.15; 24. Lamech was often believed to have incurred the curse by killing Gain, as in Hugh of St. Victor, Adnotationes elucidatoriae in Pentateu chon 7 (PL 175.45a6-13). 21 Civ. Dei 15.24 (II 492); on Seth and Enos, ibid, and 15.17f. (II 479-81). The religiosity of Seth and Enos becomes a commonplace, and often serves to reinforce the explanation of them as the real filii Dei. 22 Civ. Dei 15.23 (II 491-92, 489-90). The CGL text has 'filiis Cain' in the final clause, which is illogical (it corresponds to filiabus hominum) but records filiabus as a variant. On the importance of miscegenation and the theme of 'mixing' in connection with the birth of the Giants, see below, pp. 82-84. 23 See the beginning of Civ. Dei 15.22 (II 487). This notion of two races sprung from two brothers parallels, and may have been suggested by, the origin of the three great races in Noah's three sons (Gen. 9.22-10.32). There again the distinction is brought about by a crime (Ham's mockery) and leads up to a world-wide disaster (the Babelic confusion).</page><page sequence="12">54 TRADITIO Augustine was not convinced that the Giants were born only from the miscege nation of the filii Dei, for such an airtight solution created still another giganto logical crux, which we shall examine later. But on this point he was in a minority comprising mainly himself.24 Not only did Scripture seem to state that Giants had been born from miscegenation, but the identification of the filii Dei and filii Seth provided an appealingly dramatic, even 'realistic' or plausible origin for these disturbing hominids. Indeed, many Church Fathers were seduced by the dramatic possibilities of the explanation, turning it into a little melo drama. John Cassian (f ca. 435), whose Conlationes were widely read in the Middle Ages, tells us that Seth was born to Adam ' ne a fratricida et impio omne hominum genus exordium sumer?t,'25 clearly pointing to the racialist implica tions of the story. He takes the twin genealogies of Genesis 4.17-22 and 5.4-31 here as proof that the two ' races ' did not intermarry before the miscegenation which produced the Giants: Seth . . . non solum posteritati sed etiam fraternae iustitiae pietatique succederet, cuius progenies patris secuta iustitiam a societate et coniunctione cognationis illius quae ex Cain sacrilego descendebat semper diuisa perman sit, sicut etiam geneal?gi?? discretio manifeste deciarat. (Con. 8.21.2; ed. Petschenig 231) Cassian provides a version of the Giant-saga which, while fuller than most, is entirely representative of the mainstream tradition. 'Pro merito sanctitatis,' Seth's descendants were called 'angeli dei siue ut diuersa exemplaria continent filii dei,' while Cain's were called filii hominum, 'propter inpietatem uel suam uel patrum suorum et opera terrena.'26 Genesis said that the filii Dei took wives from the daughters of men because of their beauty, and Cassian takes this as the basis of a full-scale seduction. cum esset ergo inter ipsos usque ad illud tempus haec utilis sanctaque diuisio, uidentes post haec filii Seth qui dei filii erant filias eorum qui de Cain pro genie nascebantur desiderio pulchritudinis earum succensi acceperunt de ipsis sibimet uxores, quae uiris suis parentum suorum nequitias infundentes, ab illa eos ingenita sanctitate ac simplicitate paterna protinus conruperunt. (ibid. 238) 24 Augustine would have us read the postquam of Genesis 4.4 as 'et post illud, cum' (Civ. Dei 15.22 [II 490]). Gf. Freculphus, Chronicon 1.14 (PL 106.927c4f.): 'quos et ante esse historia deciarat, cum dixit "Gigantes autem . . ."' etc. See n. 46 below. 25 Johannes Cassianus, Conlatio 8.21.2 (ed. M. Petschenig, GSEL 13.237). 26 Gassian takes Psalms 81 (82).6-7 as proof that the filii Dei are Seth's sons. In Civ. Dei 15.23, Augustine notes that angelus means nuntius, and says that the filii Dei before their fall fathered children not from lust or pride, but rather to procreate 'cives civitatis Dei, quibus adnuntiarent, tamquam angeli Dei, ut ponerent in Deo spem suam, similes illius [Enos] qui natus est de Seth, filius resurrectionis, et speravit inuocare nomen Domini Dei' (II 490).</page><page sequence="13">'de historia gigantum' 55 The speed and thoroughness with which the filli Dei were seduced from their innate goodness is all but allegorized by the children their wives bear. de . . . filiis Seth et filiabus Cain nequiores filii procreati sunt, qui fuerunt robustissimi uenatores uiolentissimi ac truculentissimi uiri, qui pro inormi tate corporum uel crudelitatis atque malitiae gigantes nuncupati sunt. (ibid. 240) However, for Cassian, the fili? Dei are ultimately responsible for the havoc wrought by the impious Giants, because they gave in to sensual delight and committed the crime of miscegenation. ita ergo filiis Seth libidinis instigatione transgressis illud mand?tum, quod ab exordio mundi huius naturali instinctu diutissime fuerat custoditum, necesse fuit per litteram legis postea reparari: 'filiam tuam non dabis filio eius uxorem nec de filiabus eorum accipies filio tuo, quia seducent corda uestra, ut discedatis a deo uestro et sequamini d?os earum ac seruiatis eis. ' (ibid. 240f.) This pastiche of Scriptural injunctions against intermarriage27 is the clearest possible proof that Cassian and other Christian thinkers saw the fall of the filii Dei as a full-fledged miscenegation. The notion of miscegenation was vital in that it explained the 'hominid' nature of the Giants, the fact that they were only partly human. The unnatural combination of posse, mal volere, and argomento de la mente (to use Dante's terms, which imply an evil parody of the Trinity and link the Giants to Dante's Satan), whereby the Giants became a direct cause of the Flood, was so consum mately evil that Christian thinkers refused to believe that God had created the Giants directly. It was much more comfortable to believe that they had been born as a result of man's own breaking of a primal taboo. Sulpicius Severus (c. 363-c. 420) called the Giants monstra, and said that monsters always result from the mixing of two discrete natures.28 Sulpicius believed that angels had sired the Giants, but although Filastrius of Brescia (f ca. 397) declared that the Giants 'non alia natura sed de hominum fuisse progenie editos' (De haeresibus 108: PL 12.1224c8-1225a1), he nonetheless agreed that their name should be glossed as terrae monstrum (ibid.: 1224c5). Even Augustine says that many are worried by the seeming 'non-humanity' of the Giants ('non quasi homines gene ris nostri, sed gigantes') (Civ. Dei 15.23 [II489]). He himself likened the 'mixture and confusion of the two cities ' of Cain and Seth to the Fall of Adam, which was also 'occasioned by woman.' According to Augustine (as also according to Cassian), the filii Dei committed a radical disordering of charity 'when they forsook God, and were enamoured of the daughters of men' (Civ. Dei 15.22 [II 487-88]). 27 See Deut. 7.3, Ex. 34.16, 3 Kings 11.2. 28 'Cum diversae inter se naturae permixtio monstra gigneret': Historia Sacra 1 (PL 20. 97A3ff.).</page><page sequence="14">56 traditio Once it was established that the Giants had been born as a result of miscegena tion, it was perhaps natural that an attempt should be made to trace their inher itance on either side. For thinkers in the Greek Church especially, Seth had a distinctive role in early antediluvian history. Georgius Monachus (or Hamar tolus, fl. ca. 840) maintained that the Giants inherited their great strength and stature from Seth, while their malice and depravity came from Cain (Chronicon 1.1; PG 110.88Al0ff.). Eutychius of Alexandria (877-940), who called Seth the ' father of the Giants who existed before the Flood, ' said that he was ' beautiful of face, strong and of perfect stature, like his father, ' implying the same division of attributes (Annales: PG 111.911a15-b2). A story recounted by Josephuscon cerning the manner in which Seth's descendants saved the disciplines of astron omy and geometry from oblivion, by inscribing them on flood- and fire-proof pillars, led most Byzantine historiographers to credit Seth with a near-perfect intellect and the invention of astronomy and the Hebrew alphabet. Georgius Monachus and Michael Glycas both gloss the 'sons of God' crux by saying that Seth was called a god because of his scientific achievements and his piety.29 As time went on, the story of the filii Dei continued to accumulate detail, especially in the Eastern Church. Eutychius recounts the story in melodramatic, dime-novel format, as an extended, progressive seduction and corruption of the sons of Seth; as each patriarch dies, he makes his descendants swear on the blood of Abel not to be lured down from their holy mountain by the music and orgies of Cain's daughters. Naturally, these appeals are for nought (PG 111.907-15). But there was a paradox at the heart of the Giant-saga. If it was true that the Giants were inherently evil, and if, as was commonly believed, the Deluge was sent specifically to destroy them, it must have seemed strange to Christian thinkers that the Israelites should have encountered Giants like Goliath of Gath and Og of Bashan in postdiluvian times. Indeed, although no writer I have encountered explicitly voices his concern over the problem, it is clear that a number of thinkers, including Augustine, recognized that a too-close scrutiny of the problem of the Giants created a potential stumbling-block for the faithful. Let us consider the evidence for a moment: Genesis itself seemed to assign the Giants an origin apart from the rest of humanity. That origin was sinful by definition, i.e., the breaking of a sexual taboo. Whether one glossed the filii Dei as angels or as Seth's descendants, one had to admit that the Giants were an impure and bastard race, whose evil was, for all practical purposes, 29 Josephus, AJ 1.68-71 and 106 (Blatt 132, 136-37); Georgius Monachus, Chronicon 1 (PG 111.85c5-8); Michael Glycas, Annales 2 (PG 158.244c7f.). Gf. John Zonaras; Annales 1 (PG 134.60b12-c1). The Suda and other Greek sources are quoted by J. J. Mader, De Biblio thecis atque archivisi virorum clarissimorum libelli et commentationes2 (ed. J. A. Schmidt; Helmstedt 1702-1705) 1.18-21.</page><page sequence="15">'de historia gigantum' 57 genetically determined. Yet if Giants existed in the postdiluvian world, even in greatly diminished numbers, it was clear that their race had somehow survived the very Deluge God sent to destroy it. Conversely, if they could reappear in the postdiluvian world without any of their antediluvian ancestors having survived the Flood, why had Genesis given them such a specific and exclusive origin? Again, if they could reappear spontaneously through the ordinary processes of human procreation, then they could not be radically different from the rest of mankind (i.e., ontologically evil). To complicate things even further, the Book of Genesis, the Epistles of Peter, Augustine, and a host of other authorities all declared that only eight persons had survived the Flood: Noah, his three sons, and their wives.30 Noah could not have been a Giant, or else he would not have found favor with God; for Noah was a 'vir iustus et perfectus ... in generationibus suis, cum Deo ambulavit' (Gen. 6.9). Hence an orthodox interpretation of Genesis, based on the notion of a just and providential God, seemed to exclude the possibility of the Giants' survival, and yet the existence of Og, Goliath, and other postdiluvian Giants proved that they had survived. The problem is susceptible to seeming absurd, unless we remember two things: first, the fact, already mentioned, that the notion of the Giants as a radically different ' race ' was defeated only in the past century. Second, we must remem ber that the problem of the Giants' survival was not an isolated piece of sophistry, but rather, especially in the Christian tradition, part of an entire complex of genuinely disturbing problems surrounding the Biblical account of the Deluge. As Don Cameron Allen showed thirty years ago in The Legend of Noah, the story of the Deluge was the most important crux in the tradition of literal commentary on the Bible, and from very early times, Christian writers wrestled desperately with the gross problems of verisimilitude which it presented. Indeed, the problem of the truth of the Flood-story and of Genesis in general has remained a vital one in some circles, even in recent times.31 In fact, there is a contemporary parallel, for, as I write these words, fundamentalist Christians in the United States are demanding that school textbooks recount the Creation story of Genesis alongside the theory of evolutionary selection, as a valid alternative to Dar winism, while a school of ' Creationist ' biologists and anthropologists in at least 30 Gen. 7.13; 1 Peter 3.20; 2 Peter 2.5; Civ. Dei 15.8, 15.21, 17.22, etc. 31 D. C. Allen, The Legend of Noah: Renaissance Rationalism in Art, Science and Letters (Illinois Studies in Language and Literature 33.3-4; Urbana 1949, repr. 1963). See also Wendt, Before the Deluge; C. C. Gillispie, Genesis and Geology: A Study in the Relations of Scientific Thought, Natural Theology and Social Opinion in Great Britain (New York 1951).

Warshofsky, 'Noah, the Flood, the Facts,' Reader's Digest (Sept. 1977) 129-34.</page><page sequence="16">58 TRADITIO one American university claims that their theories, based on a belief in the literal truth of Genesis, are 'scientifically' sounder than evolution.32 Aside from the problems discussed by Allen, such as the manner in which the floodwaters were produced and then removed, the vast size of the ark, the numbers of species required to fill it, and the food, water, space and sheer work required to sustain them for a year, there were other disturbing discrepancies in the account of Genesis. For instance, in the City of God, Augustine tackled 'ilia famosissima quaestio, ubi Mathusalam quattuordecim annos uixisse post diluuium conputatur, cum scriptura ex omnibus, qui in terra tune fuerant, solos octo homines in area exitium commemoret euasisse diluuii, in quibus Mathusalam non fuit.'33 A similar question was sometimes asked about the mysterious priest Melchi zedech, King of Salem, who, ' proferens panem et vinum, ' blessed Abram in Genesis 14.18-20. On the evidence of Psalm 109, Saint Paul assimilated him to Christ because he was ' rex pacis, sine patre, sine matre, sine genealogia, ?eque initium dierum, neque finem vitae habens, ' and it was clear that his bread and wine prefigured the Eucharist.34 But where had he come from, and how was it possible that he was 'sacerdos Dei altissimi'? Despite Paul's allegoresis, the literal problem remained. One popular solution in the Middle Ages was to identify Melchizedech with Noah's son Shem, thus accounting for both his piety and his genealogy.35 These problems concerned individuals, but another group addressed more theoretical concerns related to the problem of the Flood. There was a typological dimension to the Flood, as well. It was not only the demarcation-point for the first and second of the traditional six ages of Christian historiography; we have already seen that it was typologically assimilated to the Fall and to the Babelic confusion (above pp. 48 and 55). In fact, Dante mentions these events as symmetrically recurrent instances of the same basic human sin fulness, glossing them with the proverb 'non ante tertium equitabis.'36 Other symmetries could be found in the progression from Adam to Abraham. Josephus points out that Noah was in the tenth generation from Adam, while Abraham was in the tenth from Noah (AJ 1.79; Blatt 148). Noah and Abraham both were blessed by God; Noah survived the Flood and Abraham witnessed the firestorm 32 On the resurgence of 'Creationism, ' see R. M.

Denique sicut illic enumeratis supra generationibus usque ad Noe . . . , ita et hic enumeratis generationibus ab ilio, qui est appelatus Sem, filio Noe, usque ad Abraham, deinde insignis articulus similiter ponitur . . . (Civ. Dei 16.12 [II 516]) Augustine is here careful to reinforce the thematic similarity by pointing out the stylistic repetition which also relates the story of Abraham to that of Noah. The twin calamities of water and fire mentioned above are ultimately traceable to ancient Chaldaean traditions, and are reflected in the Timaeus and in Jose phus' Antiquities, two works which spawned an entire medieval genre of specu lation on the fragility of human learning. Almost every universal history in the Middle Ages tells the story of how one sage or another (usually Zoroaster or the sons of Seth) transcribed some or all of human knowledge on two pillars, one fireproof and the other floodproof, and how the floodproof column saved human knowledge from being destroyed in the Deluge.38 More than any other, this anecdote illustrates how the Flood captured the imagination of Christian thinkers, for just as Noah and the Ark created a bridge to transmit piety from the old world to the new, so the pillar implemented a rebirth of arts and sciences in the postdiluvian world. One of the putative authors of the antediluvian column was Noah's son Ham, who was identified with Zoroaster by many Christian writers. Neither Ham nor Zoroaster was well-treated by Christian historiographers, except in this one instance. Although he was also believed to have invented the evil discipline of magic, Ham / Zoroaster was supposed to have saved the seven liberal arts from oblivion by transcribing them, in digest form, onto seven pillars of bronze and seven of brick.39 37 2 Peter 3.3-13; Civ.

Cassian says that during the time that their lineage was separated from that of Cain, Seth's family studied natural science (scientia omnium nalurarum), but after the fall of the filii Dei, they began to study black magic, which drew them away from true religion 'ut sacro ilio cultu diuini numinis derelicto uel dementa haec uel ignem uel a?rios daemonas uenerarentur et colerent. ' Ham, ' qui superstitionibus istis et sacrilegis ac profanis erat artibus institutus, ' knew that he would not be able to hide his magical memorialis liber or 'recipe-book' from his father and brothers while they were shut in the Ark. So he transcribed it on sheets of metal and hard stones, ' quae scilicet aquarum conrumpi inunda tione non possent. ' After the Flood, he recovered his book and used it to spread his anti-religion of magic (Coni. 8.21.6ff.; CSEL 13.239-40). As the first absolute demarcation-point of history, it was logical that the Deluge should inspire thinkers to speculate about ways in which its destructiveness might have been partially circumvented. Ham was widely accepted by Christians as the agent through whom evil was reborn in the postdiluvian world (a role he already has in Genesis 9.20-27). Yet although Nimrod, the 'Giant' who led the Babelic insurrection, was Ham's grandson, only one account claims that the postdiluvian Giants stemmed from Ham. And that account manifestly derives from the unorthodox gigantology of Annius of Viterbo.40 Indeed, although there could be little doubt that Ham brought evil back into the world after the Flood, he could not be conceived of as the 'father' of the Giants if they were really a separate 'race' partially descended from Cain, both because all of Cain's descendants were supposed to have died in the Flood, and because, despite his evil, Ham was clearly a direct descendant of Seth. Thus, in spite of his evil nature, Ham provided no solution to the crux of how the Giants survived the Flood; he was simply a parallel instance of the revival of evil in the postdiluvian world. Just as they were less nervous about interpreting the phrase 'sons of God,' and thus deciding the nature of the Giants, so Hebrew writers were quicker than their Christian brethren to solve the question of how Giants survived the Flood. Jewish commentators found the solution in the book of Deuteronomy, wherein we find the phrase ' Solus quippe Og rex Basan restiterat de stirpe gigantum ' 40 I. E. Rathborne, The Meaning of Spenser's Fairyland (Columbia University Studies in Comparative Literature 131; New York 1937, repr. 1965) 146-47. Rathborne's analysis should be used with caution; although she quotes Jean Lemaire de Beiges' adaptation of Annius' fables, she forgets that, for Annian writers, Noah and his entire family were Giants (see below, pp. 70-85). Her statement that 'the Bible is of course the original authority for the notion that Cham was the father of the giants' (146) may originate in one of the authors she is examining, but it is certainly not true.</page><page sequence="19">'de historia gigantum 61 (Deut. 3.11). They interpreted the phrase with what, to modern eyes, looks like extreme liberty, and took it to mean that Og had been the only Giant to survive the Flood. (To Christian writers, its more obvious meaning was that Og was the last Giant Canaanite to fall before the onslaught of the Israelites in their battle for the ' land of milk and honey. ') Thus the story evolved in Rabbin ical literature that Og had made a deal with Noah; Noah allowed him to ride out the Flood by sitting on the outside of the Ark, and, in exchange, Og agreed to serve Noah and his descendants as slave.41 Og-stories are something of a staple in the Talmud, and a great deal of the fabulous lore about him passes to the Arabic tradition as well. In fact, it is safe to say that Og is the archetypal Giant in Judaic and Arabic literature. Og stories gave rise to considerable mockery by rationally-minded writers, however. The eminent Ibn Khald?n (1332-1406) laughed heartily at the tradition that Og had been so large that he could bring up fish from the bottom of the Ocean and dry them on the sun.42 In the Christian tradition, Nicholas of Lyra (f ca. 1349) was the most serious opponent of Og-stories, precisely because the Jews had proposed Og as the solu tion to the survival-crux. In his commentary to Genesis 7.23, ' remansit autem solus Noe, et qui cum eo erant in arca,' Nicholas states: Ex hoc patet falsitas aliquorum iudaeorum dicentium quod Og qui [postea] legitur rex Basan propter sui magnitudinem et fortitudinem evasit diluvium. Hoc enim dictum manifeste contradicit huic litterae ac etiam praecedenti, cum dicitur ' Consumptaque est omnis caro ' et sequitur, ' universi homines, et cuneta in [quibus spiraculum vitae est interra, mortua sunt].'43 Although he does not mention the detail of Og's riding on the Ark, Nicholas of Lyra here takes the 'eight persons only clause' as a definitive refutation of Og's having transmitted gigantism to the postdiluvian world. He also mocked other proofs of Og's great size: his lectus ferr eus, nine cubits long, which some commentators interpreted as his cradle, and the story according to which Og was preparing to throw a mountain at the Israelites, but was thwarted by a divinely-sent combination of voracious ants and his own teeth.44 41 See L.

Indeed, although Nicholas does not specifically mention it, Og was given a sort of nickname by some Rabbinical commentators: Ha-palit, or 'the Escapee.'45 For such a nickname to have evolved, the notion of Og's escape from the Flood must have been extremely common among Rabbinical commentators. Since they were unwilling to accept Og as a solution to the crux of the Giants' survival, Christian authors did not resolve this problem any more satisfactorily than they did gigantic origins. As I have already pointed out, Augustine was the one authority who most resolutely opposed the notion of the Giant. He seems to have seen, more clearly than any other writer, the severe doctrinal problems adumbrated by theological theories of the Giant. Therefore, Augustine essen tially denied that Giants were anything other than large human beings. First, he cited examples of gigantic stature even in his own age, in order to prove that Giants had not ceased to exist in Mosaic or Davidic times. Second, he categori cally maintained that so-called 'monstrous' races, including those of the kind mentioned by Pliny, could not be both ' monstrous ' ? inhuman ? and de scended from Adam. This caveat not only excluded the angels as filii Dei, but also attacked the notion of the Giant as ' hominid, ' a somehow inferior hybrid created by miscegenation. The keystone of his argument is grammatical: his contention was that the Scriptural locus should be interpreted to mean that ' al ready there w7ere Giants in the earth in those days, in which the sons of God took wives of the children of men, ' rather than that this union alone produced Giants. This interpretation, based on both a point of translation as well as on Augustine's intuition,46 divorced the notion of gigantism from its overtones of racial and 45 Textus Biblie I fol. 333v (cf. Biblia Sacra I 1485-86); Biblia Sacra I 204. On Ha-palit, see Stephens, Berosus 287-88 and nn. 53-54. 46 The King James version supports Augustine's reading of Gen. 4.4: 'There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men' . . . (emphasis mine). Augustine's solution is implicitly refuted by the Douai transla tion: 'For after the sons of God went into the daughters of men . . .,' The Holy Bible, Trans lated from Latin Vulgate and Compared with Other Editions in Divers Languages (Douai, A.D. 1609; Rheims, A.D. 1582) (London 1914 repr. 1964) 8. The force of postquam for the Douai translator is corroborated by a note to the passage, warning readers to 'be very cir cumspect in their marriages' so as not to incur similar 'unhappy consequences' of a bad choice. Augustine's interpretation derives from his use of the so-called Vetus Latina transla tion (based on the Septuagint) rather than the newer translation of Jerome. For the passages in question, see Vetus Latina: Die Reste der altlateinischen Bibel nach Petrus Sabatier neu</page><page sequence="21">'de historia gigantum' 63 volitional determinism, eliminated the probably heterodox idea that someone other than ordinary humans had provoked God to send the Flood, and dissolved the problem of the ' eight persons only clause, ' or the manner in which Giants could have survived the Flood. Augustine's notion that Giants were simply large people could have brought him into conflict with those who related tales of fossil ' Giants' bones ' and enor mous tombs, because they maintained that Giants were many times larger than ordinary humans. But, after admitting that he himself had seen ' on the shore at Utica a man's molar tooth of such a size, that if it were cut down into teeth such as we have, a hundred, I fancy, could have been made out of it, ' he ex plained that antediluvian Giants were so colossal because they were simply overgrown antediluvians, and that even ordinary antediluvians were much larger than ordinary moderns. Since Pliny had maintained that human stature is steadily declining, it did not require much imagination to see that the Titans of old stood in the same statistical relation to their contemporaries as modern physical deviants.47 Augustine's solutions were eminently sensible, and could have resolved both the quaestio physica about the possibility of gigantic stature, and the doctrinal dilemmas entailed by the notion of the Giants as a separate 'race' or 'species.' However, the most appreciated parts of his argumentation were those that left the latter question within the terms already established by Judaeo-Christian gigantological discourse.48 The most-often-quoted section is that in which he denounces the Book of Enoch for its 'fables' about the angels' having sired the Giants. Taken out of context, this denunciation often served later writers as an authoritative basis for repeating the filii Seth solution. The notion of a race of Giants did not die for many hundreds of years after Augustine, probably because the Scriptures, by the phrase filii Dei, by the stories of the terrifying Enakim, and by other references, like terra gigantum and stirps gigantum in the third chapter of Deuteronomy, seemed clearly to imply that such a 'race' had existed. So, later writers continued in the main to regard the Giant-crux as a real problem, posing an implicit challenge to the notion of a Providential scheme of history. In fact, although the Giants are an obligatory chapter in almost every uni versal history and Scriptural commentary, there are relatively few scholarly treatises on the problem. The monographic literature begins with Philo of gesammelt und herausgegeben von der Erzabtei Beuron 1 (Freiburg 1951) 104. For Augustine's evaluation of Jerome's translation, see Civ. Dei 18.43 (II 639). 47 Civ. Dei 15.9, 22f.; Pliny, Naturalis Historia 7.16.73?L; cf. Homer, Iliad 7.155f. (Nestor describing Ereuthalion) and 7.211ff. (depiction of Ajax). 48 In fact, Paul of Burgos tried to reconcile the 'angels theory' with Augustine's remark on incubi and succubi (Civ. Dei 15.23), but he was reprimanded by Matthew of Thuringia for misreading (Biblia Sacra 1.149, 152).</page><page sequence="22">64 traditio Alexandria (f a.d. 45-50). Significantly, however, all other treatises seem to have been composed after Annius' work had come into circulation. The treatise on quaestiones physicae by Sixtus of Siena (1520-69) is now lost, perhaps destroyed at the author's own behest when he died. Another treatise, by Jean Chassagnon (fl. 1595), was written in response to the Gigantomachia, in which Goropius (1512-78) had claimed that the Giants never existed. The chief merit of Chas sagnon's treatise is as a compendium of the commonest commonplaces about Giants in the Judaeo-Christian tradition. As such, it was derided as a collection of 'inezie' and 'vane, o sconce o false ragioni,' by Vico, who had his own un orthodox ideas about Giants.49 The last and most important gigantological treatise is by the Biblical commen tator Augustin Galmet (1672-1757). His Dissertatio de Gigantibus is a compen dious review of Giant-lore and its sources. As such it strikes the modern reader as conservative in its contentions, not only from our point of view, but even from that of Augustine.50 Aside from its supremely orthodox purpose of proving that the Giants mentioned by Scripture actually existed (and thus, of course, that the Bible is reliable at the literal level), Calmet's treatise is almost entirely consumed by the necessity of resolving the quaestio physica: that is, whether and to what extent gigantic stature was possible. But, while it may at first seem to ignore the cruxes we have been discussing, Calmet's treatise actually confronts them, by implication and allusion, at almost every step. Calmet straddles no fences in his definition of gigantic stature. A Giant, he says, is not an individual who merely overtops his contemporaries by a few inches. Rather, a true Giant's height would exceed 'the normal five-and-a-half foot stature of our own contemporaries by several feet, even doubling, tripling, or quadrupling it' (Migne 764). Evidence for the existence of such individuals in the remote past is unassailable, says Calmet. Not only can it be found in the works of Moses, ' vetustissimo ilio scriptore, ' but it is corroborated by ancestral memory, by a 'vetus et constans populorum traditio.' However, the evidence of Moses and folklore, 'asserta, vetera, et certissima monumenta,' has lost credibility as a result of the unfortunate exaggerations perpetrated by later 49 On Philo, see above, . 18.

'Cave cum poetas credas,' for 'men have such an innate propensity for novelty that not only poets, but even historians, willingly added bigger to big, exaggerating what was already worthy of marvel, until now it is far from easy to prescribe appropriate limits to the question, and discern truth from false hood' (ibid. 783; 763; cf. 771). Still, Calmet recalls that, as was their usual practice, even the poets constructed their gigantological fables on a foundation of Scriptural truth.51 Calmet's vast researches are interesting not only for what they uncovered but also for what they failed to produce. Their most striking and significant feature is the absence of any controversy over the character of the Giants. With one exception ? a writer dependent on Annius52 ? Calmet and his numerous sources uniformly portray the Giants as evil. Horum autem si nullum vel specimen extat nostra aetate, id partim tri buendum divinae numinis ultioni, quae tot criminum et scelerum monstra solo tantum nomine in mundo superesse toleravit; partim vero hominum cautioni, qui inito omnium gentium foedere, exterminandis perniciosissimis humani generis adversariis arma intulerunt. (Migne 788) Calmet also includes a list of Scriptural references to the Giants as exemplars of the punishment reserved for the wicked (Migne 776; cf. 771, 780, 789). His treatise provides definitive proof that the vile nature of the Giants was never questioned before Annius did so. (In fact, even Augustine did not attack the notion of their evil character.)53 It is safe to say that, since what Dante calls their mal volere was taken for granted, any pre-Annian exception, such as Og's self-serving cooperation with Noah during the Flood, merely confirms the rule of evil Giants. A second point taken for granted by Calmet and his sources, and which also bears directly on the pre-Annian tradition, is the notion that Giants were pre dominantly antediluvians. The stress on families or lineages serves a twofold distinction which Calmet constantly reiterates. On the one hand, he opposes the idea of a race of Giants to that of isolated monstra; on the other hand, he distinguishes between the race in its full antediluvian flower, and its scattered, ever-dwindling postdiluvian remnants (Migne 764; 775; 780). Calmet leaves no doubt of his belief in an actual race of Giants, with its distinc tive racial characteristics and an ancestral habitat: 'En gigantes, gigantum familias, civitates, populos . . ., ' he declares (775). This point is interdependent with another quaestio physica. Calmet goes to great lengths to prove that, 51 See Calmet's own dissertation, An veteres legislatores et philosophi e Scriptum leges suas el moralem scientiam hauserint, in Migne 747-64, and the works cited below, n. 76. 52 Jacques Boulduc (c. 1575-1650), De Ecclesia ante Legem 1.1.7ff.; 3.2, cited by Calmet, Migne 770.

Dei 15.23, end (II 492).</page><page sequence="24">66 TRADITIO however ' monstrous ' the Giants may have seemed to ordinary humans because of their great size and depravity, they were not mere monstra. To classify them as such, he says, would mean in effect to deny them the power of propagation: 'Porro, si inter monstra rejiciendi sunt gigantes, nunquam satis fr?quentes fuisse oportet; rara sunt enim, utpote praeter consuetas naturae leges, monstra' (Migne 770; cf. 764, 769). Without presupposing whole peoples and cities of Giants, we cannot defend the literal truth of Biblical passages concerning ancient Canaanite Giants. This contention runs absolutely counter to Augustine, who wished to efface the genetic question (and its implications for Providence) by reducing the birth of Giants to the status of accident, a position that led precisely to regarding the Giants as monstra. In his desire to establish an ethnology of the Giants, including their geographical distribution (Migne 774; 778ff., esp. 780; 789), Calmet all but exhausts the lexicon of kinship: populus (771; 773); species (777), stirps (772; 774), natio (774; 778); gens (773; 789), genus (773; 775). In sum, although they were a race apart, the Giants described by Calmet differed from ordinary homines only in their great size and their prodigious capacity for evil: 'homines illos nihil a reliquis nisi statura corporis discrepantes; bellum autem in Deum non armis, sed criminibus et sceleribus movisse' (789); 'non monstra . . . sed certa hominum genera' (790). Calmet differs from earlier gigantologists because he vehemently dismisses the two great cruxes. For him, the genealogy of the Giants and their survival of the Flood are not problematic issues; nor is he intimidated by the argument of certain skeptics that the discrepancy between gigantic and ordinary stature violates the scriptural maxim which says that God created all things according to number, measure, and weight (Migne 767; 789: cf. Wisd. 11.21). Calmet's equanimity on both counts comes from his having thrown out the entire problem of miscegenation. Not only does he dismiss the theory that the filii Dei were demons (Migne 764-65; 769-70; 776-77; 790-91), but more decisively, he accepts without reserve or comment Augustine's dictum that Giants already existed when the filii Dei had children by the filiae hominum (771). Calmet truly accepts Augustine's interpretation on faith, for when he quotes Genesis 6.4 on the misce genation of the filii Dei and filiae hominum, he quotes from the Vulgate, which has postquam rather than Augustine's et post illud. Even more surprisingly, while he dutifully rejects the idea that the filii Dei were angels, he accepts the pre-Augustinian interpretation, in all its error, as proof that a race of Giants existed: . . . uno verbo, magno numero gigantes olim in mundo spectatos, quorum frequentia id efficeret, ut non monstra habentur, sed certa hominum gene ra. .. . Eorum error, qui persuasum habuerunt, gigantes ex angelorum perduellium cum filiabus hominum connubio prodiisse, extitisse olim gigantes invicte probat. Testimonium de recepta apud populos de gigantibus tra ditione admittimus, rejicimus errorem. (Migne 790-91)</page><page sequence="25">'de historia gigantum' 67 The most conspicuous absence in Calmet's whole treatise is his suppression of any reference to the controversy over the identity of the filii Dei. To have discussed the controversy as a controversy would have involved him in a serious discussion of miscegenation, which, on the authority of Augustine, he evidently wished to avoid. It is extremely curious, however, that, while he cannot accept the Giants' origin from miscegeantion, Calmet paradoxically accepts the two characteristics which that origin served to explain: the Giants' existence as a race and their racially determined, inveterate propensity for evil. The Giants' evil instincts and their unnatural origin are always inseparable: each logically implies the other, for if taken separately, each indicts the notion of Providence. In effect Calmet accepts the notion of an absolutely and invariably evil species, without ever seeking the cause of that evil. Ironically, he seems to have considered the Giants' physical or genetic essence more dangerous, from a theological point of view, than their spiritual essence or character. Or perhaps, given the volume of traditional evidence and the weight of Augustine's authority, their character was simply much less open to question than their origin. Still, it is curious that Calmet did not seek some sort of cause for the Giants' evil nature, in order to avoid having to assume that God created an inherently evil species. Similarly, although he never openly discusses the problem, Calmet cannot entirely ignore the questions raised by the Giants' having survived the Flood. It is true that once the genealogical problem has been supposedly cleared away, Og of Bashan no longer has singlehandedly to transmit the gigantic ' genetic code' to the postdiluvian world, and Calmet can present the familiar stories about Og's height as ludibria errantis phantasiae (Migne 773). At the same time, however, he surreptitiously enlists Og-stories as proof that some antediluvians were of gigantic stature (ibid. 772-73). More surprising still is his reference, apparently in support of the idea that Giants existed before the miscegenation, to the Kabbalistic Adam Kadmon, whom God created so enormous that the angels were terrified, and then obligingly reduced to a 'mere' few hundred cub its, which stature Adam retained until he tasted the fruit of the Tree of Knowl edge (ibid. 771-72).54 To declare Adam a Giant is to step completely outside the bounds of traditional gigantological discourse, carrying the question beyond Cain and Seth to the origins of humanity; ultimately it is to equate the Giants' innate evil with Adam's misuse of his free will. We have seen that Augustine's dismissal of the genealogical problem accorded with his conviction that God had destroyed all Cain's descendants in the Deluge (above, p. 53). However, Calmet's difficulties cannot be solved so readily. For one thing, Augustine had sidestepped the implications of the Giants' neces 54 On this belief about Adam Kadmon, see G. Scholem, On the Kabbala and Its Symbolism (tr. R. Manheim; New York 1965) 162.</page><page sequence="26">68 TRADITIO sarily evil character by treating them as a living sign or allegory (above, p. 51), and we have seen that Calmet does not follow him in this. In fact, he more than once dwells on their evil character. Calmet does not phrase the question in its traditional terms (i.e., how the evil Giants could have survived a calamity sent specifically to destroy them), but several times he betrays his uneasiness at God's having allowed these evil creatures to survive for so long. We have already observed him claiming: 'Horum autem si nullum vel specimen extat nostra aetate, id partim tribuendum divinae numinis ultioni, quae tot criminum et scelerum monstra solo tantum nomine in mundo superesse toleravit' (Migne 788; above, p. 65). In another place, he states that Joshua and Caleb exterminated them, 'genus impium, ut diutius in mundo persisteret, non ferente numine' (ibid. 775). These references implicitly address the question of why, if He sent the Flood to exterminate evil (Gen. 6.5-7), God permitted the Giants to survive it (or to reappear after it). Because he defines the Giants as an evil race, Calmet offers no solution to this conundrum. Before leaving Calmet, we should observe what else his Giants are not. First, they are not the diu viventes of Josephus, as Annius' Giants clearly are, although Calmet alludes at least three times to the diu viventes.50 Although he does quote Abb? Tilladet (ca. 1650-1715) to the effect that everyone from Adam to Nimrod was a Giant, Calmet denies that gigantism was ever universal: 'Nec tarnen in ea sumus sententia, primos homines universos, sicut et omnes veteres Palaestinos et Siculos, gigantes fuisse. '56 Nonetheless, he would seem to concur with Augus tine that all antediluvians were in some measure larger than we (Migne 772), thus opening the possibility that antediluvian Giants were larger than postdilu vian ones. Still, he does not openly declare his position and thus, while para phrasing the gigantomastiges, he even cites evidence contrary to Augustine's theory: Si naturae senescentis vitio homines imbelliores essent, qua statura, qua viribus, quam olim fuerint, statueremus etiam oporteret, naturam in eo consistentiae statu jam inde a pluribus seculis mansisse: cum jam inde a tribus annorum chiliadibus factum sit, ut staturae hominum nihil addatur decerpaturque. Quare nunquam per nos admitteretur veterum illud: 'Cuneta mortalium generi minorem in dies mensuram fieri propemodum observatur.' (Migne 768; cf. Nat. Hist. 7.16) If this were true, concludes Calmet, 'Ad pygmaeos profecto redactos jam homines spectaremus' (ibid. 769).57 55 Migne 769 ( .), 787, 790 (bis). On Annius' diu viventes, see Stephens, Berosus, 293-94. 56 Calmet mentions Tilladet's notion in Migne 787-88, but in 789 he is anxious to refute both those who deny that Giants ever existed, and those who claim that they were univer sal, since he needs to prove a racial definition. His use of the evidence here is both similar and related to his treatment of Adam Kadmon (n. 54 above). 57 See n. 47 above.</page><page sequence="27">'de historia gigantum' 69 As we noted, Calmet's Giants are an evil race, and so his reference to Jacques Boulduc's pious saintly Giants, who are derived from Annius and are also men tioned by Vico, serves only as an example of his boast that he has mentioned all the evidence, even that which contradicts his definition of the Giants (Migne 777). Boulduc had maintained that 'gigantum nomen esse honoris, datum viris illis justis ante et post diluvium.'58 Altogether, Calmet's analysis shows how little the essential questions of gigan tology had changed by his day. True, the emphasis had shifted somewhat, away from the still-disturbing questions of origin and survival, and toward the quaestio physica of gigantic stature. This shift in emphasis had been prepared by a growing awareness of natural history, as the 17th and 18th centuries faced the possibility that the 'Giants' bones' mentioned by writers since Antiquity might have actually belonged to elephants or whales, or might indeed be mere ' fossils, ' a lusus naturae with no animate history, deliberately sculpted by Na ture, formed as a stumbling block to presumptuous human reason (Migne 771; 791-92). Calmet rejects the finality of these new arguments for the same reason that Augustine had thrown out the question of the filii Dei: because they threaten to undermine the credibility of the letter of Scripture. He ends his treatise with an attempt at scientific accommodation which forms a poignant contrast with the traditional, bookish argumentation he has been using: Sunt enim fossilia colore dilutiora, quippe quae ad terrestrem magis, ubi concreverunt, acc?dant. E solida materia compacta sunt, non intus inania, ut hominum ossa. Nec impossibile credimus, ut elephantum et ceti alicujus ossa pro gigantibus obtrusa sint; sed constat equidem et genuina quaedam gigantum ossa aliquibus in locis spectari, non incertum de gigantum veritate documentum. (Migne 792) Still, despite the looming threat of rationalistic inquiry, Calmet preserves the main points of traditional gigantological discourse by asserting: (1) the existence of a race of Giants, 'hominids' of much greater stature than the mass of man kind; (2) their unrelentingly evil character; (3) their predominantly antediluvian chronology, with the Mosaic age as a rough cut-off point; (4) the hint of a theo logical conundrum in the Giants' survival of the universal Deluge. Good Giants, then, and wise or erudite Giants, are nowhere evident in the theological mainstream.59 Their passport into serious literature and folklore 58 Migne 770. See . 52 above. 59 A census of Biblical loci bearing the word gigas bears this out quite dramatically. As Bede says, 'Ponitur vero et gigas aliquando in bono, ut est istud de Domino: "Exultavit ut gigas, ad currendam viam" [Ps. 18.6], sed hoc pro potentia singulari qua caeterum genus hum?num jure transcendit, dispositumque Incarnationis sacramentum mirabili virtute pere git, sicut etiam leo aliquando Dominum, aliquando diabolum d?sign?t, sed diabolum propter superbiam et ferocitatem, Dominum propter potentiam' (Hexaemeron 2 [PL 91.84a15-b8]). Indeed, there is only one other locus where gigas does not seem to have a strictly pejorative</page><page sequence="28">70 traditio was to be the pseudo-Biblical antiquities of Annius and the flood of nationalistic historiography Annius' work unleashed. II. Pseudo-Berosus and the Giants The traditional notions about Giants which we have been examining were seriously challenged by the gigantology which Annius of Viterbo offered to the European readers of his pseudo-Chaldaean Berosus. Almost every trait that we have hitherto seen as constant was redefined, if not entirely subverted, by the ' archaic history ' of Berosus and the fastidious commentaries on it by Annius. It is impossible to discuss the gigantology of Annius' Berosus without treating its overall context in the Annian uvre, for the revolution in gigantology under lay a new mythos of European origins and history. It is clear from Annius' program that he and his followers were proposing the creation of an anti-Ren aissance through the fiction of Noah's colonization of Europe soon after the Deluge. According to Annius, the culture founded by Noah's grandchildren, a race of good-natured, pious, and erudite Giants, would have outshone the civilizations of Greece, Rome, and most of the ancient Near East, had it not been overrun by newer, more materialistic empires and religions.60 The Leitmotiv of Annian pseudo-history thus became the fiction of a return to forgotten sources of history. The rediscovery of a splendid, pre-Roman European civilization supposedly took place through Annius' recovery and exegesis of lost auctores vetustissimi, especially of Berosus the Chaldaean.61 Berosus is the most ancient of Annius' pseudo-authors. The real Berosus (or Berossos), who was active about 290 b.c., was an eminent historian and astrologer, who was cited approvingly by several ancient authors. Pliny the Elder recounted that the Athenians had erected a statue of Berosus, with a gilded tongue to celebrate his unerring prognostications. In the Jewish Antiquities and Against Apion, Flavius Josephus cited the histories of Berosus and other gentile authors in order to furnish independent corroboration of the Old Testament stories, so as to defend the authenticity of Judaism while attacking the complacent ' supe riority complex' of the Graeco-Roman culture which had conquered it. Berosus was an especially prestigious witness to the veracity of the Biblical story of Noah, for he told a similar Flood-story (which also ? but very faintly ? resembles connotation (1 Mace. 3.3). The other loci of the Old Testament are: Gen. 6.4; Deut. 2.11, 20; 3.11, 13; 2 Sam. 21.18; 23.13; Judith 16.8; Job 16.15; 26.5; Ps. 32.16; Prov. 9.18; 21.16; Wisd. 14.6; Ecclus. 16.8; 47.4; Isa. 14.9; 26.14, 19; Baruch 3.26. I have found no mention at all of Giants in the New Testament. 60 On the patriotic, misohellenistic anti-Renaissance of Annius and his followers, see Stephens, Berosus, esp. 25-56; 209-71. On Noah's colonization, see Allen, Legend 113-37. 61 For a full account of the contents and method of Annius' texts and commentaries, see Stephens, Berosus, esp. 25-56, 88-208.</page><page sequence="29">'de historia gigantum 71 the one recounted by Utnapishtim in Gilgamesh). However, since Josephus did not actually quote from the Chaldaean Flood-story, and since it appeared in Annius' day that Berosus' works had perished in antiquity, Annius decided to rewrite the Defloratio Ber osi Chalda?ca. His title is itself a tribute to Josephus' veneration for the authority of 'Berosus, qui Chaldaica defloravit.'62 In the Defloratio and in his commentary on it, Annius expanded upon what he had read in Josephus and claimed that Berosus had been curator of the temple library at Babylon shortly before the time of Alexander the Great.63 The histor ical records in the Library contained first-hand accounts which dated back al most to the time of Creation, said Annius, because when Nimrod went out to found Babel, he stole a number of books from Noah. These books contained the wisdom and history of the antediluvian patriarchs, including chronicles or memoirs handed down from Adam to Noah. Thereafter, the Chaldaeans recorded ' whatever happened either in your country or in ours, or in any other region of which we are informed . . .; any actions noble or great or in any other way re markable . . . have all been written down by us of old and are preserved in our temples. '64 Thanks to the archaeological diligence of the Chaldaeans, the Library of Babylon eventually became a veritable warehouse of history, according to Annius. By the time Berosus took over as curator, the mountain of documents was becoming unmanageable. Thus, to facilitate the historiographie labors of later generations, Berosus wrote a condensation or defloratio of universal history as contained in the ' eyewitness ' accounts on file in the library. Only the deflo ratio remained after the Library was destroyed, and even it was lost for many centuries, until an Armenian priest supposedly brought a copy, in Latin transla tion, to Annius.65 62 On Berosus, see RE 3.309ff.; P.

Annius identifies Ham with Saturn (below, n. 87). Annius* euhemeristic reduction of all elder gods to Noah's immediate family takes place mainly in the Aequivoca of ps.-Xenophon (1515, fols. 34 -41 ). 85 On the fortune of this etymology (even in Hebrew literature of the 1500s) see Stephens, Berosus 191-92 and n. 68.</page><page sequence="35">'de historia gigantum' 77 Civ.

The epithet propagator may be an ironic reference to the enlargement of sexual boundaries advocated by Ham (it was an epithet of Jupiter in his role as extender of boundaries [see C. T. Lewis and C. Short, A Latin Dictionary, s.v.]). Certainly Annius sees 'propagator of infamy' as an etymology, which harmonizes with Ham's sexual 'propaganda.' On incest in the antediluvian world, see Civ. Dei 15.16 (II 476-79). 87 On Ham/Saturn and Chem Myn, see 1515, fols. 113r and 116r; for 'Saturnus' as an hono rific title, fol. 34v. 88 Needless to say, Noah's colonizing voyage is a mixture of traditional assumptions and Annius' fantasy (he cites Phyto Hebraeus de multiplicato humano genere as his source, 1515, fol. 116v). On the fortune of Annius' invention of the voyages, see Allen, Legend, 113-37 (but use with caution: there are several serious inaccuracies in these pages). 89 Annius identifies Noah's recension of the antediluvian patriarchal writings on science and theology with both the Etruscan libri rituales celebrated by Roman writers (see the excerpt from Festus in Lewis and Short, A Latin Dictionary s.v. ritu?lis) and the Kabbala (fols. 71r_v, 81r_v, 124v, passim).

Magisque studuit paci et religioni Saturnus deorum quam opulentiis.* Et turrim quidem aedificavit sed non complevit*, nec designatam urbem fundavit quia post quinquaginta sex annos subito non comparavit translatus a diis.91 It is clear that Annius' pseudo-Berosus is thus far merely a paraphrase of the early chapters of the Book of Genesis (4.17-11.9). The segment we have seen owes an even greater debt to Flavius Josephus' own paraphrase of Genesis in the Jewish Antiquities (1.60-147), although at various points Annius will later borrow from other authors, notably Diodorus Siculus, whom he read in Poggio Bracciolini's Latin translation. Annius explained the close resemblance between Genesis and pseudo-Berosus by claiming that Abraham had carried the knowl edge of antediluvian sciences and history from Chaldaea into Egypt during his migrations (Gen. 12.10-20; AJ 1.158-68). From the Egyptians, Moses learned the history and sapiential lore of his antediluvian ancestors (a fact which the sectarians of Hermes Trismegistus were emphasizing in Annius' day).92 Moses later edited these raw materials into the stories we now read in the Book of Genesis. ' Thus it is no wonder, ' says Annius in his analysis of Moses' and Bero sus' sources, ' if they are in agreement, for they drank from the same fountain of history' (fol. 107r). In fact, as will already have been noticed, the agreements between Moses and pseudo-Berosus are only superficial, or, more correctly, the events of Genesis form the substructure over which Annius drapes an exotic surface, which con siderably changes the meaning and import of the Biblical story. The Giants, who Annius says were born into the eighth generation (counting Adam as the 90 Pseudo-Berosus' chronology uses the end of the Flood as a cut-off point analogous to the Christian reckoning according to the birth of Christ and the Jewish reckoning since Creation. Henceforth, I shall use the abbreviation p.d. (post diluvium) when discussing this chronology. 91 Pseudo-Berosus indicates here that the Babelic confusion of tongues took place in 187 p.d. (131 -f 56). Traditional Christian historiography dated the event in 100 p.d., on the basis of Gen. 10.25 ( 'nomen uni Phaleg, eo quod in diebus eius divisa sit terra') and Gen. 11.10-16, wherein it appears that Peleg was born in 100 or 101 p.d. See AJ 1.146; Civ. Dei 16.10f. (II 511-15), and Stephens, Berosus 177-86. Annius also gives the traditional date of Peleg's birth as 101 p.d., on fol. 114v; this he can do because he has separated the divisio terrarum (which becomes Noah's colonization tour) from the Babelic confusion, with which it is linked in Gen. 11.9. However, on fol. lllr Annius contradicts this, saying that Peleg was born tempore divisionis linguarum (i.e., not terrarum). This oversight presumably re mains from one of the several earlier redactions of Annius' fictions. 92 For bibliography on the question, see Stephens, Berosus 128 n. 7, 129 nn. 18-20.</page><page sequence="37">'de historia gigantum' 79 first), correspond to the inventive sons of the evil Lamech descended from Cain: Jobel, Jabal, and Tubal-cain (Gen. 4.19-22), as Annius himself conceded in his commentary (fol. 107v). The inventions of Annius' Giants are those of Lamech's sons: tents, bronze-smithing, and music, all construed in malo as the accouter ments of luxuria and violence (fols. 106v-107v). The prophecies to which Annius alludes include the supposed prophecy of Enoch which is quoted in the Epistle of Jude (vv. 14-15); this is another point which Annius makes explicit in his commentary.93 Annius' assertion that Noah was the father of the heathen gods derives from a long Christian tradition of euhemeristic mythography, which reduces the gods to ancient heroes and kings, and pagan mythology to dim rememberings of older Judaic truths. (Annius further exploited this tradition in another of the spurious works in his collection, the Aequivoca attributed to Xenophon.)94 Finally, Annius found the story of the cult of Ark-relics, and the details of Myri Adam and egres sorium Noae among Josephus' quotations from the real Berosus and other histo rians.95 As we noted earlier, Annius' version of antediluvian history grew out of a careful collation of Josephus' Jewish Antiquities with its source in the Book of Genesis. This was a fairly standard means of explicating obscurities in the Old Testament, and accounts for the enormous popularity of Josephus' work with Medieval and Renaissance commentators. But Annius' history of the Giants is one of the foremost examples of the way in which he exaggerated and deformed standard procedures of exegesis. In regard to the mystery of the Giants' origins, Genesis omits to discuss the date of their apparition. Thus, Annius followed Josephus and declared that they were begotten in the seventh generation from Creation.96 This allowed him to identify the Giants with the sons of Lamech; however, although Jobel, Jabal, and Tubal-cain are in the eighth generation, Josephus himself did not identify them 93 Stephens, Berosus 69-76. 94 Pseudo-Xenophon is summarized in Stephens, Berosus 37-38. On Euhemerism, see J. Seznec, The Survival of the Pagan Gods: The Mythological Tradition and Its Place in Renais sance Humanism and Art, tr. B. F. Sessions (1953, repr. New York 1961), esp. 3-36. 95 See above, n. 74. Annius' pseudo-Archilochus begins with a pseudo-quotation: 'Maseas Phoenix Damascenus libro nonag?simo s?ptimo historiarum asserit . . . , ' a strategem based coyly on the fact that in AJ 1.94 Josephus had quoted from book 96 of the same work (see n. 99 below). 96 Josephus says that the sons of Seth 'septem generationibus permanserunt deum iudi cantes esse dominum omnium et ad virtutem sempter inspicientes, deinde tempore procedente de paternis sollemnitatibus ad mala progressi sunt . . . ' (AJ 1.72 [Blatt 132]). Annius echoes him by saying: 'Hue usque imp?a s?ptima generatio ab Adam excrevit per universum orbem.

Bede and Isidore of Seville calculated that the Giants were born only in the ninth generation, and were thus contempora ries of Noah's father (De Temp.: PL 90.288cl0; Chronicon: PL 83.1020b1). John Zonaras, a twelfth-century chronicler, believed that Giants were born only after Noah's time, and that Nimrod, the first Giant, was a grandson of his son Ham (Annales 1: PG 134.64a13-b2). Since most writers accepted Augustine's interpretation of the 120 years which God allots to mankind when He decides to send the Flood (Gen. 6.3) as a declaration of the time remaining to all humanity, and since Noah's sons were born one hundred years before the Flood, Bede and Isidore are probably voicing a majority opinion.97 In his commentary on the first book of pseudo-Berosus, Annius lists the date of the Giants' origin as one of the problems (cognoscenda) raised by the sketchy histories of Genesis and Berosus; thus he was aware of making an innovation in gigantological speculation. He cites the translation of Enoch to Heaven as a further proof of his theory: Quod vero etiam s?ptima generatione iustorum ab Adam [coeperunt]* iusti effici participes scelerum et vitiorum, est argumento quod Enoch septimus ab Adam fuit translatus 'ne malitia immutaret cor eius,' ut scribitur Sa pientiae .iiii. capitulo [i.e., vv. 10-11], Et ideo respondetur . . . quod im piae posteritatis peccata sub Gaym coeperunt, iustorum vero sub Enoch propheta, quern propter bonam vitam Deus [cito] transtulit, ne cum aliis iustis iam ad impietatem inclinatis consentiret. (fol. 107v) 1498: [coeperint] Annius' innovation also enabled him to dramatize the evil of the antediluvian world, because it allowed ample time for Cain's city of Enoch (Gen. 4.17), rein terpreted as the capital of the Giants, to build its worldwide empire. In this, Annius ironically followed through on Augustine's hint that ' the same city which Cain built, and named after his son Enoch, may have had a widely extended dominion and many kings, not ruling simultaneously, but successively' [Civ. Dei 4.20 [II 484]). The origin of the Giants, their survival of the Deluge, and their inventions are all questions determined by traditional beliefs about their nature. Annius' single most important challenge to traditional theological gigantology is his declara tion, made on the sole authority of pseudo-Berosus, that Noah was a Giant. Annius made Noah a Giant in order to solve the ancient theological conundrum discussed above (pp. 56-57), that is, the contradiction between the Giants' obvious survival of the Flood, and the categorical declaration of Genesis and the Church Fathers that only Noah and seven other persons survived the Flood. Annius seems to have believed that if his solution were accepted, there would 97 On the 120 years, see above, p. 52. On the birthdates of Noah's sons, Gen. 5.31; 7.6.</page><page sequence="39">'de historia gigantum' 81 no longer be any need to invent apocryphal stories about Og of Bashan or other Giants having survived the Deluge. In his commentary on pseudo-Berosus, Annius several times ridiculed ' Talmudic legends ' about certain Giants' having escaped the Deluge. 'Rursus memoratu dignum est,' he says at one point, ' quod octo solum animas salvatas a diluvio tarn Moyses quam Chaldaica [Caldea] historia [i.e., Berosus] tradit, contra fabulosos simul et haereticos Talmudistas, qui (ut supra diximus) nullo certo authore dicunt multos gigantes fuisse salvatos in Monte Sion' (fol. 109v; cf. fol. 108r~v). Annius' 'Talmudists' are, as usual, somewhat suspect.98 His failure ever to mention Og of Bashan in his gigantology is sufficient proof that he never read the Talmud; had he done so, he could not have escaped the numerous stories about Og. In fact, he even undermines his own assertions for, although he claims that the Talmudists tell of many Giants being saved on Mount Zion, he says elsewhere that ' even the better Talmudists ' (etiam peritiores Talmudistae) agree that Noah was a Giant and an astrologer (fol. 108r). In fact, the idea for this 'Talmudic' doctrine about Giants waiting out the Flood on Mount Zion may have come to Annius from Josephus, from Servius, from Eusebius' Praeparatio Evangelica (in Trapezuntius' translation), or from Petrus Comestor's statement that ' Post diluvium tarnen nati sunt alii gigantes in Hebron . . . ' (Historia Scolastica, Genesis 31: PL 198.1081d13i.).99 The idea may even have come from Nicholas of Lyra, who, in his comment on Genesis 7.21-23 mentioned the 'falsitas aliquorum Iudaeorum dicentium quod Og qui legitur rex Basan propter sui magnitudinem et fortitudinem evasit dilu vium.'100 In fact, it was probably Nicholas who gave Annius the idea for a 'Hebrew' etymology of Titanes, one which allowed him to prove the Titans' Noachian, rather than Greek, ancestry.101 However, where Annius gleaned the raw materials for his imaginary Talmudists' assertions ultimately concerns us less than the use to which he put them. By declaring that both Moses and Berosus testified that only eight persons survived the Deluge, and by stating categorically 98 On Annius' largely fictitious Talmudists, see Stephens, Berosus 186-91. 99 Josephus says that the reason the waters flooded over all mountains to a depth of fifteen cubits was 'ne plurimos fugae occasio liberaret' AJ 1.89 (Blatt 134); but he also quotes Mnaseas of Damascus to the effect that '"est super Miniadam excelsus mons in Armenia, qui Baris appellato, in quo multos confugientes sermo est diluvii tempore liberatos et quendam simul in arca devectum in montis Ocile summitatem . . . fuit autem iste quem etiam Moyses Iudaeorum legislator scripsit'" (AJ 1.95). Calmet (Migne 777) quotes Josephus, 'narrans spectari in Hebron immania quaedam hominis ossa/ See also Eusebii Pamphili Evangel?cete Praeparationis libri XV, ed. E. H. Gifford (Oxford 1903) 3.1.450 (Babylon founded by Giants who escaped the Flood). In Timaeus 22d (Hamilton / Cairns 1157) Plato remarks that 'When . . . the gods purge the earth with a deluge of water, the survivors . . . dwell on the mountains.

Whether or not he was familiar with Og-stories, Annius' fictitious traditions about gigantic Noachides should have sent Og into a well deserved retirement. However, although Annius' Noah solved the problem of the Giants' survival, he contradicted the notion that they were inherently evil; and this was a revo lutionary step. Despite Augustine's attack on the concept of the Giant, Christi anity had never shaken off the notion that Giants were evil, and so to make Noah a Giant was to aggravate paradox into oxymoron, since, according to Genesis and the entire accumulation of Judaeo-Christian exegesis, Noah was the one righteous man of his age. In addition, Annius' assertion that the earth was entirely repop ulated by Giants after the Flood contradicted the theological tradition that Giants were primarily antediluvian, and only a sporadic, if problematic, presence thereafter. Furthermore, this repopulation by Giants went against the theologi cal consensus that the Deluge had been sent at least in part to destroy the Giants. Still worse, the idea that the Giants had an unnatural origin long after that of ordinary men, a universal idea in Christian commentary, would mean, if taken in combination with Annius' claims, that the earth had been repeopled by an unnatural, bastard race. By making Noah and all his progeny into Giants, Annius completely destroyed the moral category of the Giant, even while he sought to maintain and exploit it. Annius' own account of the horrific mores of the Giants, and his creation of a passage in Berosus to document Noah's gigantism, both show that he was aware of the innovations he was making, if not of their implications. For some reason ? perhaps the mere fascination which Giants retained as an ontological category and a theological problem ? Annius ignored Augustine's solution, which, by separating gigantism from the sin of the sons of Seth, allowed the Bishop of Hippo to theorize that all the antediluvians were of enormous stature, in accordance with their greater vigor and longevity. Far from throwing out the filii Seth explanation, as Augustine had done, Annius accepted it, and inte grated it into an even more disturbing explanation of the origin of the Giants. Miscegenation, the usual explanation of the Giants' origin, is the violation of a taboo which is racial in nature. While Annius accepted the filii Seth variant of the miscegenation hinted at in Genesis, his acceptance was really only lip service. In fact, he replaced the notion of miscegenation with that of incest, as an explanation of the origin of the Giants. This is curious, of course, because, while miscegenation-taboos restrain an individual from straying outside kinship affiliations, incest-taboos prevent his moving too far in the opposite direction, toward the source of kinship. However, although Annius particularly stressed incest, he also included sodomy and bestiality, as well as miscegenation, in an overall catalogue of purely sexual crimes which led to the creation of the Giants.</page><page sequence="41">'de historia gigantum' 83 In a spectacular interpretative leap, he declared that Moses' own words indi cated that sodomy, bestiality, and especially incest caused the Giants to be born. Porro de peccatis Luxuriae: nihil erat sceleris quod supreme non admitte rent: incestum, sodomiam, et brutalitatem. Quod etiam Moyses non tacuit, dum asserit eas uxores accepisse quas eligerent: scilicet sive matres sive alias. Et item, 'Omnis caro corruperat viam suam [Gen. 6.12],' scilicet Sodomia et brutalitate. Quare ex his nati sunt gigantes ut ibi ait Moyses. (fol. 107 ) Even Annius' explanation of the filii Dei crux does not allow miscegenation the place it had occupied in previous explanations of the crux. The fall of the filii Seth is for Annius merely an indication that the just had also begun to indulge in sexual perversion, rather than a direct and exclusive cause of gigan tism. Sed in hac s?ptima generatione impia et excommunicata coepit iusta posteri tas Adae cum excommunicatis participare coniugio et supradictis sceleribus impioriim, quia teste Moyse videntes filii Dei scilicet iusti homines, filias hominum et Gaymicae posteritatis, quod essent pulchrae, id est opulentae et fortunatae, non obstante excommunicatione, [et]* ipsi acceperunt sibi uxores ex omnibus quas elegerant. (fol. 107v; emphasis mine) *1498: [etiam] Thus in the Annian scheme, the racial element of the taboo imposed on the filii Dei has all but disappeared, while the sexual element has been enhanced. For Annius, gigantism results from breaking the most intimate and terrifying taboo of all, the injunction against incest. Now the notion that the origin of the Giants was in some measure due to sexual crimes other than miscegenation, even to incest, was not entirely foreign to the Christian exegetical tradition.102 In fact, Annius' explanation probably derives from Petrus Comestor's paraphrase of Methodius' account of a gradual slide into sexual perversion, which culminated in the birth of the Giants. Ac cording to Petrus Comestor, there were four stages in this progression. First, the sons of Cain (sic) ' abutebantur uxoribus fratrum suorum nimiis fornicationibus. ' Then, 'mulieres in vesania versae supergressae viris abutebantur.' Later, 'exarserunt homines in alterutrum coeuntes.' Finally, only after these devia tions had taken place, ' filii Seth concupierunt filias Cain, et inde orti sunt gigan tes. '103 Still, Annius went further than his predecessors in enhancing the sexual element of the passage. He not only destroyed the importance of the fall of the filii Seth, which for him became a mere proof that the entire world was sexually 102 Hugh of St. Cher, Opera 1.9; Aurora Petri Rigae Biblia versificata, ed.

Notice that Petrus Gomestor makes the sons of Gain the original villains in the story.</page><page sequence="42">84 TRADITIO corrupt, but he invented explicit authority for his assertions. The incest-passage in Berosus allowed him to give a new and shocking interpretation of Moses' assertion that ' all flesh had corrupted its way. ' There was really no reason for Annius to meddle in this particular aspect of gigantology. In fact, his solution to the crux of origin has much the same weak nesses as his idea that Noah was a Giant. Although Christianity condemned incest, to propose that incest was the cause of gigantism complicated the Christian view of the earliest marriages. As Augustine said, Cum igitur genus hum?num post primam copulam uiri facti ex puluere et coniugis eius ex uiri latere marium feminarumque coniunctione opus habe ret, ut gignendo multiplicaretur, nec essent ulli homines, nisi qui ex illis duobus nati fuissent: uiri s?rores suas coniuges acceperunt; quod profecto quanto est antiquius conpellente necessitate, tanto postea factum est dam nabilis religione prohibente. (Civ. Dei 15.16 [II 476-77]) Although, as Augustine said, incest became 'completely reprehensible in later times, ' the idea that it could have produced ordinary mankind on one occasion and evil Giants on another surely cried out for some explanation. Even more ironically, the notion that incest caused gigantism could have served Annius well, if the proper explanations had been provided. For it would have provided an alternative and perhaps more cogent solution to the problem of how Giants survived the Flood, since it would have eliminated the necessity for individual Giants to escape drowning. Even had all Giants been destroyed in the Flood, new incestuous couplings would afterward have restored their ' race. ' This would ultimately have entailed fewer contradictions of the traditional consensus about the nature of the Giants and the role of Noah in the postdiluvian world. Even in Annius' own desultory system of gigantology, it is inconsistent to make Noah and his family Giants, for Berosus clearly distinguishes between gigantes and ordinary homines, showing the former to be thoroughly evil: 'Per Gigantes enim intellegimus homines vastos corpore, famosos, et deorum contemp tores, et hominum similiter oppressores. '104 All of Annius' other Giants, in both antediluvian and postdiluvian worlds, are evil; indeed, marauding Giants play rather a large role in the late postdiluvian segments of Berosus' chronicle.105 The Giant Noah is thus a disquieting oddity, and very much the deus ex machina: like other Annian solutions to exegetical cruxes, Noah represents an awkward attempt to serve the cause of Scriptural authority in a thorough-going and highly visible way. Annius' contributions to the history of gigantology are thus twofold. By making Noah a Giant, he contradicted the long-standing consensus of Judaeo 104 1515, fol. 107r. Cf. fol. 134v. Annius mentions Diodorus and Macrobius as corroborating his definition of Giants, which is based on Genesis 6.4. 105 See the story of Osiris, Hercules Libyus, and the Giants, beginning on fol. 127r.</page><page sequence="43">DE HISTORIA GIGANTUM 85 Christian opinion that the Giants had been inherently evil and stupid, and that the Flood had destroyed them or reduced them to an isolated phenomenon. In Annius' analysis, Noah becomes, not merely 'the exception that proves the rule' about the nature of Giants, but rather the means by which the concept is accidentally voided of all sense. Although Noah is merely the exception to antediluvian Gianthood, he is also the source of a race of persons whose capacity for good and evil, wisdom and stupidity seems indistinguishable from that of ordinary humans. Still worse, all non-Noachian Giants remain evil, even after the Flood, as just remarked. Indeed, the decision to make postdiluvian mankind descend from a Giant Noah turns the question of gigantic origins on its head; for Annius, men descend from Giants, and not vice-versa. This notion, and the removal of racial overtones from the Giants' own origin, turns their survival of the Deluge into a meaningless, trivial question. Gianthood and humanity have become interchangeable, and hence meaningless, categories. All these innovations might have created a revolution in serious gigantology if they had been openly expounded. But An nius' ostensible fidelity to traditional gigantological consensus merely increased his effectiveness as an agent of confusion. By paying lip-service to the filii Seth, filiae Cain solution, and to the Giants' traditional nature and character, as well as to the problem of their survival of the Deluge, he ensured the per sistence of these topics in later discourse, and simultaneously voided his own solutions of their originality and potential impact. This may explain why an immediate and resounding controversy did not arise over Annius' gigantology. Still, both in the slavish repetitions of his stories by chauvinistic historiographers and in the works of a few later gigantologists, Annius' ideas circulated and were discussed.106 Indeed, although Annius' Antiquitates do not seem to have had widespread appeal in Italy until the mid-1500s, they provided a mine of fraudulent informa tion for patriotic historiographers in France.107 After a lapse of over a decade in which only one partial edition was issued, Parisian typographers soon ex ploited the burgeoning quarrels between Louis XII and Julius II in order to saturate the French book trade with editions of Annius' forgeries.108 Between 1509 and 1515, six of the first nine editions of the forgeries were printed at 106 On the work of Boulduc and Tilladet, see above, nn. 52 and 56. 107 por bibliography and analysis of Annius' French and Italian fortunes, see Stephens, Berosus 1-20, 209-71 and nn. 108 on French polemical works, esp. those written by Jean Lemaire for Louis XII, see Y.

Indeed, Lemaire's biased 'translation' so nearly eclipsed the original text that even today, most references to Annius' forgeries give a distorted idea of his intention, since most scholars, especially the French, are unaware that Lemaire's book is not 'the dry bones of Annius dressed in literary flesh,' as D. C. Allen thought,111 but rather a programmatic revision, in which Annius' patriotic emphasis on ' Noachian ' Etruscans was supplanted by an even more spurious pseudo-Annian chronicle of 'Noachian' Gauls.112 Lemaire's Illustrations provided, through their numerous printings, the most widely available medium for Frenchmen to encounter the gigantology of Annius. However many liberties he took with the nationalistic conclusions of Annius,113 Lemaire was relatively faithful to the Giants of Berosus. Still, the transition from Annius' scholarly format and solemn litanies of bibliography to Lemaire's narrative may have seriously damaged the effectiveness of the Annian mytholo gies. A reading of the Annian stories as retold by Lemaire strikes one imme diately by the similarity which Lemaire's narration shows to that of Alcofrybas Nasier: compare Lemaire's use of adjectives and his attempted reconciliation of scholarship and the merveilleux to the mannerisms of Alcofrybas.

Lemaire's 'bon P?re No?' has all the outlandish goodness and wisdom, min gled with pious bourgeois stolidity, of the early Grandgousier.

(1.19) There is even a parallel with the miraculous fertility of Rabelais' Utopians (Tiers livre, ch. 1) in the speedy repopulation of Armenia by Noah and his family.

And although Rabelais archly declares that the miraculous fertility of his Uto pians came about '? l'imitation du peuple Judaic en Aegypte,' and intimates that Nicholas of Lyra is his authority ?

Alco frybas Nasier) in his two earliest books. Certainly, as I shall have occasion to remark,118 the authorial concerns of the two story-tellers demonstrate the same perplexing tension: how to write a smooth narrative which will hold the reader's attention, while yet not neglecting to include every shred of documentation which can help establish the absolute historicity and reliability of the tale, a task which is all the more difficult since the nature of the 'faictz et dictz' is so outlandishly gigantic, so exaggeratedly superhuman. The loss of scholarly format the Annian fictions underwent in their transition from commentary to roman at the hand of Lemaire may have alerted some schol ars to the considerable silliness of these Giant-stories in their original, respectable guise. However this may be, it seems quite clear that the transition from An nius' dry, unadventurous Latin to the abundance of Lemaire's rhetorical, yet often na?ve French, allowed the cross-fertilization which ultimately produced Pantagruel and Gargantua: the comic shenanigans of the Grandes chronicques, mingled with the earnest, pseudo-scholarly exegetical and historiographie pre tense of the Illustrations de Gaule. Without the long tradition of theological gigantology, which Annius and Lemaire enriched and ultimately destroyed with their patriotic fictions, Rabelais' pious, scholarly superhumans would have made as little impression on his contemporaries as they have on subsequent generations of scholars. Our loss of familiarity with the themes of traditional gigantology has considerably vitiated our appreciation of such passages as the 117 In his comment to Exod. 1.12, Nicholas of Lyra notes: 'Dicunt Hebraei quod mu lleres Hebraeae in quolibet partu pariebant plures pueros; et aliquando usque ad quattuor, ali quando usque ad sex. Ideo dicitur "et quasi [germinantes multiplicati sunt} [Exod. 1.7]." Sicut per germinationem unius grani nascuntur . . . multa grana. ' See also Voltaire, L'homme aux quarante ?cus, final chapter ( 'D'un bon souper chez Monsieur Andr?'): 'Le docteur de Sor bonne . . . cita le p?re Petau, qui d?montre qu'en moins de trois cents ans un seul des fils de No?

Goodrich (above, . 6) could still say in 1852 that 'It has been estimated, that under circum stances so favorable, the human race might have increased to the number of 400,000,000,000 before the year of the deluge. But all calculations of this nature must be regarded as mere hypothesis. We have reason to think that a portion of the earth was very populous at that period, but of the numbers we are entirely ignorant' (I 67). 118 I have completed a monograph on 'Rabelais and the Giants of Theology' based in part on the above analysis and in part on Berosus, which I hope soon to publish.</page><page sequence="47">'de historia gigantum 89 origins and genealogy of the Giants (Pantagruel, ch. 1), Pantagruel's war with the Dipsodes and the Giants of Loup-Garou, the discovery of the Giant's tomb (Gargantua, ch. 1), Bringuenarilles, the 'avalleur de moulins ? vent' and the Enigme en proph?tie, not to mention numerous passages relating to antediluvian themes exploited by the patriotic historiographers of Rabelais' time.119 Clearly, these passages, which may seem flat, ' popular, ' and even dull to modern readers, evoked complex cultural and intellectual associations that the foregoing anal ysis has only begun to reveal. Further study by scholars of such seemingly simple and popular themes in Rabelais' work will undoubtedly discover other intellectual pedigrees as long and distinguished as La g?n?alogie des g?ants.
