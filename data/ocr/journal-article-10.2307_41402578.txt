<plain_text><page sequence="1">Judith Kitchen The Properties of Rain * The big story of America has always been the story of the westward movement. And the big story of that movement has been the sheer cussedness of nature in its natural state. Anyone who has crossed this country by car must have conjured the images of covered wagons raising dust at a walker s pace. You imagine the heat, the endlessness. You see up close what you only knew from 30,000 feet- perpendicular roads cutting the land into symmetrical fields, the vast plains tamed by fencerows until, at the edges, they fray and dissipate into untidy expanses of rocky outcrop or scraggly trees leading up toward snow-covered peaks. You have visions of Lewis and Clark pushing on, over the Bitterroots, into not only the unknown but the unknowable. It was luck, or some- thing suspiciously close to it, that took them to the Columbia. As you make your way through the Cascades, you know that if they had taken a slight turn to the north, they would surely have turned back. Even now, the car at full speed and the road graded for uphill ease, the forest seems impenetrable. The road signs are ominous: fallen rocks, icy bridges, runaway trucks. Only twenty years after Lewis and Clark, there were paddle steamers on the Missouri, taking goods as far as Fort Leavenworth. Forty years later, they made regular trips to Hell Gate (Missoula), Montana, carrying supplies of food and tools for settlers and miners. At the DeSoto Natural Wildlife Refuge Museum in southwestern Iowa, the excavated cargo of the Bertrand , which sank in 1865, parades in ghostly silence behind glass. In dim light you see what it takes- blasting powder, pickaxes, shovels, bucksaws, oil cans, padlocks, sharpening stones, tar paper, bullwhips, cigars, ledgers, daybooks, buckles, ribbons, thimbles, yarn, gloves, candlesticks, ink, mirrors, teakettles, wash- boards, water tumblers, lemon extract, mustard, lard, soda crackers, Worcestershire sauce, currants, bitters, ale - to complete this particular story. *An essay-review of Accused of Wisdom.

Preserved by a mudslide in the early 1700s were bark baskets, cedar canoes, beadwork, hats, harpoons, combs, toys, paddles, rope, even metal tools fashioned, it is thought, out of flotsam from shipwrecked Asian vessels. One museum contains the seeds of the extinction of the other, you might think, or- from another perspective- you might conclude that both contain the story of mans encounter with nature: the need to work with and against its forces in order to survive. It would be fascinating to study the archaeology of the image of nature in poetry. If we could get back to the primitive sound- the chant or the prayer or the song- we might be able to discern just when we began to sense ourselves as something apart from, differentiated by, in opposition to, in thrall of. But by the time the words were written, they were already in search of their origins. Ancient poets are as varied as contemporary ones in how they negotiate the ter- rain between that large, impersonal it and the more intimate us. Some of the differences reside in sensibility, I suspect, and others in circumstance. It would be impossible to see things the same way if you spent your days squinting at the freight train on the far horizon in Montana or you whizzed past the birch-inflected woods of Vermont. Now that Im an official citizen of Washington State (this is determined by whether you know how to pronounce Puyallup), I find myself constantly confronted by what I call, at least to myself, the Great Reminder. If you ride on out into the wilderness, you find it to be just that - wild. The roads close by November and won t open again until May. The evening news brings its weekly disasters- climbers lost in not-so-freakish storms on Rainier, a drifting boat the only sign of missing fishermen, two teenage girls who escaped a cougar by jumping into a river, a two-year-olds footprints in the mud leading toward a swollen stream . . . then nothing. My sons warn me about snow in the passes, and I realize that danger is not an impersonal noun. Only the rain is tame- gauzy and indistinct, a bit like memory itself, a presence in the air, something felt but not quite seen. Theres a sheen on the pavement, a damp chill at the back. Yet I am drenched in speculation. What if I took one image - rain- and charted its course in the hands of several poets? What would this tell me about the landscape of metaphor? In her latest book, Accused of Wisdom, Linda Allardt uses nature as a springboard for meditation, finding in her careful observations of rural upstate New York a meta- phorical lesson to be mined and recognized for what it is- the larger wisdom of the universe. Rather than look to nature for confirmation of her human wishes, Allardt watches nature for what it might tell her about "the deep source / that draws us / to swim down."</page><page sequence="3">JUDITH KITCHEN 183 Spoken - no, whispered- as if to someone else, someone on the other side of the glass, these recent poems ponder the shifting light by which we see things. Ques- tion marks make their sly intrusions, probing meaning for more meaning, stripping action down to motive, intention to desire. "Whats wisdom?" the speaker asks in the title poem, and then "Whats wisdom / but watching?" She pushes on to muse, "But then / the underside of watching," uncovering in her stilled observation what it is she can- and cannot- name: root-tips foraging in stony soil for any encounter. The harrowing up of the midden. The spark in the cloud, the forked track I know I lack the sight for, half-life measured in milliseconds, but true for as long as it holds still. Allardt holds still long enough to learn what she can from those milliseconds, those moments when she is "ambushed" by the fleetingly beautiful, the illusory, the damped passion of the quietly germane. Haunted by what is going away, these poems record the very process of disappearance even as they extricate from loss a residue of hope. Time is carefully orchestrated as the poems move from scrutiny to inference. Nothing is unimportant. Watch her watching rain: Sounding Dark leaf and mist this morning. Suddenly rain straight down, not the slightest wind, the green absorbed in the coming of it, the ground hollow and greedy, a cistern opened. Now the rain silvers, hurries, the leaves dance although there is still no wind. Downpour. Sound changes, fills us, deep tones heard from a long way off like thunder or whale song. Tomorrow we will be hollow again, weTl hang brass leaves on the porch and sound out the wind.</page><page sequence="4">I84 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Everything stands for exactly what it is- and more. Characteristically, the metaphor takes place at the level of the entire poem. It probes, reveals, instructs, and we are left to measure its depths. The title opens the poem to further implications. "Sound changes," coloring each stanza with vowels heard from a long way off, the initial I of /еа/ weaving its sinuous way like a trickle of rain down the windowpane. What has happened here? Only the rain, observed over time, rain that fills us with its aural otherness. And the sense that, as any good river pilot knows, tomorrow we will need to learn its lesson all over again. Accused of Wisdom is too long to be the chapbook that it claims to be, yet its forty-six pages of poetry would benefit from the addition of just a few more of these quietly thoughtful excursions into our "own dark places." The book opens with an epigraph from William Stafford, and Stafford s deep, attentive listening provides the model for these poems. Its a listening so profound that the poet does not even try to articulate it, choosing instead to let it make itself felt, like a solar wind, as a "turbulence / where light meets light." The ear is cocked for nuance. And finds it in the reiteration of sound in the ending of "Yesterday s Hawks": Not so much fear as the echo of fear under the threshold of hearing, the habit of fear under a sky empty of wings. Like the hidden creek that flows throughout this collection, there is an observant I- a muted, quicksilver consciousness - that flickers in and out, sensitive to suggestion, alert to the power of juxtaposition. The poems are marked by restraint, but some of the best ones go beyond the established logic of the natural metaphor. In these we are left with a human voice that challenges the reader to take one more step into a realm where nature may provide the questions, but not the answers. If this book has a half- life, it is that of uranium 235, capable of an explosive chain reaction. Yes, the work of Linda Allardt could - and should - be accused of wisdom. In The Actual Moon, The Actual Stars , Chris Forhan positions his speaker squarely within nature, and yet resolutely outside it. That is, each poem is given a "setting" in which the natural world is revealed, and yet the focus of the poem is on the human, the emotional. Metaphor reveals inherent correspondences. "Convergence" becomes the norm: each poem, in its own way, looks at "something about the turning of objects / and seasons and about the position of things / in relation to each other." Throughout the collection, metaphor takes place at the sentence (or line) level, often in the form of similes that make for lively transactions: "sky smudged gray, like a dust mop" or "old snow lies bunched like a wedding dress." Or they move in the other direction: "As if I'd shrugged off the cloak of my loneliness / and slipped on the shirt</page><page sequence="5">JUDITH KITCHEN 185 of the chill, diminishing light." The images play anthropomorphic ping-pong, moving back and forth, illuminating first one, then the other, side of the equation. But simile both opens doors and slams them shut again. Personification may provide a linguistic way to understand the world, but here the understanding comes, more often than not, as an emotional collation, a psychological interpretation - even revelation. See how, in "Late Winter Rain," rain forgets to be rain as it both mirrors and stirs the emotions: Wind-wrenched pines, tantrum of rain on the blacktop, flooded gutter aswirl with sticks and paper cups- thwarted desire in a riot- late winter writhing with no body, pummeling the air with no fists, importuning without a tongue. For too long a man remembers a woman till her name is a nail driven through the back of his mind, and he thinks it wise not to speak of her, and her body blurs, a confusion of shapes in shadow, and the voice that sings in his head isn't hers and is, and the face he loves slips in and out of focus like his own face, like the stranger s in the mirror he shrinks from, watching sudden rain instead spatter the walk, wind hurl itself blindly against a bush- March, for weeks so tedious, so sensible, beginning to make a fool of itself. We all know how it works: either you watch a storm that calls up cognate feelings, or you feel the chaos and invoke the turbulent details. Whatever its inception, the finished poem uses the rain to provide a metaphorical vocabulary, one that might possibly produce some insight for the writer, and will most certainly open an emotional space for the reader. That space- loss, desire, regret, astute self-consciousness- is presented in images of the natural world. And it is a world that, for all its personification, offers no overt sympathy. One knows instinctively how to "read" nature in these lines: as comparison, as example, as illumination. The storm- its tantrum and its pummel- ing- serves as a simple objective correlative. The speaker of the poem is self-conscious,</page><page sequence="6">l86 THE GEORGIA REVIEW wryly aware that the emotions verge on the foolish, can only be indulged in the storm's immoderation. The tone is one of tolerant bemusement. For all its anthropomorphized vocabulary, nature remains stubbornly incoher- ent. This is true throughout the collection. The opening poem, "No Comment," makes the point at the outset: In the leaf's veins and midrib, the mushrooms gill: no irony. In the stamen and pistil, the pip of the grape, making occurs without suffering, one is led to suppose. There is no answer to the poem's final question: "what is one to do . . . when this fern // rooted at the road's edge / casts the shadow of an infant's ribs?" The speaker can only note the similarity and phrase the question; nature offers its "no comment" in return. Nature may offer up simile, but it retreats from any real communication. And the speaker understands his essentially lonely position. In the title poem, a man leaves his bones and flesh lying in bed and sends him- self imaginatively out into the night- a night that seems to transform everything into something else while, above, the actual moon and the actual stars are "shining like nothing but themselves." This, then, is the overarching enigma. Nothing, not even metaphor, can bridge the gap. As in the final poem, "Summary and Invocation," all things metaphorical, even "the sudden heavy rain that believes in the laying on of hands," will pale beside the simple fact of the finch in the jack pine. The fact is in the moment, though, and Forhan, more often than not, wants to combine present and past, resurrect memory in contemporary circumstance. Usually he recalls a lost love, but sometimes he simply looks at the nature of time itself. "It Rusts Iron and Ripens Corn" begins with "Time to rub wax paper on the playground slide"; between title and text there is the human play of words so that the answer to its opening riddle becomes the directive by which the poem proceeds. Over the brief instant of the poem, and over the duration it contemplates, the "rust specks on the slide say: Silence soon." Often humorous, always alert to nuance, Chris Forhan engages the age-old ten- sions between the mind of man ("its wrestling match") and the body of nature ("some radiant unreason / beyond reach") with hundreds of vivid equations. And the images of nature take on delightful new hues under this onslaught. Forhan draws those images from no particular landscape, though there are some that clearly show his Northwest roots. But it's when Forhan turns this technique to the wholly human that my own ideas quicken- "an exegesis / of a bungled kiss" (been there, done that); "the same /</page><page sequence="7">JUDITH KITCHEN 187 distracting map of my own lost chances" (still caught up in that distraction); "as if the day were a series of subordinate clauses" (it is, isn't it?)- and Im hooked. Hovering between past and future, caught between the imagined and the real, the poems of The Actual Mooriy The Actual Stars are rich, crafted, entertaining, and inventive - in short, full of lively mystery. They leave you with a sharper taste for the human, with all its complicated, inexpressible shadings. Pattiann Rogers has set herself a formidable task in Generations , her eleventh col- lection of poetry. These poems are a departure for her, driven more by rhetoric and concept than by event or image. The central vision is one of unity, a twisted helix of DNA that animates the universe, connecting everything with everything else. Rogers attempts to do just that, moving from image to image, sometimes combining words ("coyoteevening" and "fernghosts" and "sanddunedocuments") in order to examine all aspects of existence. The generations of the title poem "have been walking from the beginning." They are conjured here as a swelling crowd, moving from familiar cities and beaches back through time, receding through the ice age and the suns first flares, passing from evolution to the initial Word ( let there be light), until the final stanza blends all generations in one shared experience: And people saw them coming and people saw them passing, and their walking was constant, unmoving, invariable, and the seeing of the people was ever present, immutable, liberation. Throughout this collection, Rogers uses the particular to feed- and aug- ment - her interest in abstract idea. Conflation is the operative word, and "Aspiring, Now and Then" is a good example. As she considers a spiral staircase, she "circles herself" until, like the sea, she becomes a "rage / of contradiction and unanimity." If you go far enough, she implies, opposites dissolve. From staircase to galactic spiral, the poem moves toward abstracted speculation: "Circling its form, one / step ahead, one step past, the body might / discover and become by that motion alone / the grand inevitability of the galaxy itself." The aim of generality through attention to the specific is nowhere more evident than when Rogers turns to the subject of rain: In General This is about no rain in particular, just any rain, rain sounding on the roof, any roof, slate or wood, tin or clay or thatch, any rain among any trees, rain in soft, soundless accumulation,</page><page sequence="8">l88 THE GEORGIA REVIEW gathering rather than falling on the fir of juniper and cedar, on a lace-community of cobwebs, rain clicking off the rigid leaves of oaks or magnolias, any kind of rain, cold and smelling of ice or rising again as steam off hot pavements or stilling dust on country roads in August. This is about rain as rain possessing only the attributes of any rain in general. And this is about night, any night coming in its same immeasurably gradual way, fulfilling expectations in its old manner, creating heavens for lovers and thieves, taking into itself the scarlet of the scarlet sumac, the blue of the blue vervain, no specific night, not a night of birth or death, not the night forever beyond the frightening side of the moon, not the night always meeting itself at the bottom of the sea, any sea, warm and tropical or starless and stormy, night meeting night beneath Arctic ice. This attends to all nights but no night. And this is about wind by itself, not winter wind in particular lifting the lightest snow off the mountaintop into the thinnest air, not wind through city streets, pushing people sideways, rolling ash cans banging down the block, not a prairie wind holding hawks suspended mid- sky, not wind as straining sails or as curtains on a spring evening, casually in and back over the bed, not wind as brother or wind as bully, not a lowing wind, not a high howling wind. This is about wind solely as pure wind in itself, without moment, without witness. Therefore this night tonight- a midnight of late autumn winds shaking the poplars and aspens by the fence, slamming doors, rattling the porch swing, whipping</page><page sequence="9">JUDITH KITCHEN 189 thundering black rains in gusts across the hillsides, in batteries against the windows as we lie together listening in the dark, our own particular fingers touching- can never be a subject of this specific conversation. By snatching the general from the particular, Rogers unlocks the physicality of nature even as she forces us to contemplate the power of abstracted thought- the ways we can know what we have never experienced, the ways we can synthesize and posit and distill. In telling us what she is not going to tell us, Rogers gives us essence of rain, of night, of wind, and of specificity. There is only one night in which "we lie together listening," one life lived within the myriad possibilities of life. These poems take place in a landscape of the mind, yet natural images coalesce, as in A Statement of Certainty" - where, from geology to biology to cosmology, nature is defined by its infinite varieties: black-masked or black-footed or blue- footed, spiny, barbed, whiskered or ringed, three-toed, nine-banded, four-horned, whistling or piping, scavenger or prey- whether free in cells of honey or free over tundra plains or alive inside the hearts of living trees, whether merely moments of inert binding in the right blink of buried eggs, or a grip of watching in the cold wick of water- swept seeds, this- beyond faith, beyond doubt - we are here. The "we" of the poem, however, is as generalized as its elements: grand, impersonal, all-encompassing. Even in the rare instances when the poems proclaim an "I," it seems to belong less to an individualized voice than to a momentary, assumed identity. The personal, if it can be said to reside here, is in the choice of subject, the angle of vision, the verbal play. Generations is a long book (fifty-five poems in 115 pages). Perhaps it would feel less like a treatise if the book were less dense, more personal. But Rogers brings such knowledge of science and sense of mystery that the cumulative effect is one of discov- ered truth. In an odd way, these are religious poems. That is, their impulse is toward a unifying force, a generative source. Rogers searches everywhere, looking for a lower- case deity who must attend "to the plaint of their roarings- / how the sound imitates in possibility / the breadth of the starry savannah, / in certainty the thunderous sky / of</page><page sequence="10">190 THE GEORGIA REVIEW wildebeests in stampede." "I don t know anything about god," she claims, but then adds, "unless god / is the will to whistle, ancient, / abundant, perfectly expressive / in all its forms, a will that wills to be / every manifestation of its own will." In poem after poem she continues the quest- "If god was a cow," or a ventriloquist, or, as in "Bearings on a Winter Evening," were contained in the self: "I imagine // 1 will be indivisible- so the solid / night of rivers underground, / so the light of winter, so fact / and anti-fact- in the confluence / of that creation." The clause does not resolve itself; it remains inexact as its "so" embraces opposites. We are left with the generality of the universe that permeates the first part of the book, the "whatever" that winds its way through "Keeping Up"- a force that "monitors stone and fire." Its a force that is simultaneously "steadfast" and "quick as an electron moving," as fluid and dependable as seasons, and finally Whatever it is that keeps careful watch with the fleet, the rapid, the brisk, the headlong rising or descending, must become itself the virtue of velocity, the intimate of light. By anthropomorphizing her god, Rogers creates a dialectic, while in the more per- sonal poems, she gives the intellectual pursuit a context. The voice proceeds with confidence, moving from conjecture to conviction: "And I know for certain / salvation exists." Salvation in the hands of Pattiann Rogers, though, is a far cry from Sunday- morning America. It is suffusion. It is the loud ringing of coincidence and the whisper of juxtaposition. And as in the final combinations of "Tabula Rasa," its modus operandi is the imagination at work: This country is still and void, except for a funnel of attention from which emerges an imagination lacking all countenance until it begins together with a skitter of lizard nails, an old man flicking ash, a two-pronged snail and its glistening swill, a vista of gulls eye at prey, the play of chicchirichi, a lake of sky opened by swallow doorways to form the creation of its own reality. If, in the sure hands of Pattiann Rogers, god is imagination, then it is an imagi- nation fueled by wonder at the amazing intricacy of the natural world in which we do not find ourselves apart, but a part. In an interview with Maryanne Hannan, Rogers asserts what her poems exemplify: "The physical and the spiritual are one." Generations</page><page sequence="11">JUDITH KITCHEN 191 is a complex, challenging book, orchestrated and crafted to take us into a territory that is at the same time boldly visionary and exquisitely real. Ted Kooser, our current poet laureate, goes to nature not for abstraction but to make reality more real. His poems are characteristically short, as though he were dipping his hand into water to gauge the temperature. They revel in apt comparison: his use of metaphor opens the doors of surprise, wresting one thing into the light of another, showing us the ease with which something known can be made unfamiliar, the deft ways that the extraordinary can adopt the everyday. The title of his latest book, Delights and Shadows , announces his intentions- and the poems comply. The collection is filled with samples of where he finds delight and what he finds delightful - shadowed, always, by an accompanying knowledge that life is fleeting, sometimes hard, often poignant. Rain is essential to the farmers of the central plains, and Kooser looks at rain in many guises; each time he invokes the image, it offers up something new, the properties of rain as rain transformed by circumstance. Here is the shortest poem in the book: Starlight All night, this soft rain from the distant past. No wonder I sometimes waken as a child. In two lines, Kooser uses what we know of the time light takes to reach us to alter its features: light is made liquid, falling, softly falling, from out of the past. The fusion of image and commentary creates a sense of wonder, reminiscent of haiku. We know more about starlight when we are finished reading - know something of its properties, and its power to amaze. More, we learn something about what it is to reside in time. But rain works other wonders. "The Early Bird" begins with a cold rainy May morning, "and yet the early bird / is out there chirping // chirping its sweet-sour / wooden-pulley notes." Anyone who has heard a wooden pulley instantly hears the bird, and anyone who hasn't heard a wooden pulley at least knows its a sweet-sour sound. The couplets weave their way to the bird s work, "hauling the heavy / bucket of dawn // up from the darkness, / note over note, // and letting us drink." We've moved from rain to cistern, from external sound to internalized satisfaction. Kooser is not so much interested in nature as he is in people, and he's far more interested in others than he is in himself. His titles are generalized: "Student," "At the Cancer Clinic," "The Old People," "Skater." "A Rainy Morning" holds us in the present as a young woman in a wheelchair pushes herself through the weather, lifting and then positioning her hands on the wheels in gestures reminiscent of a pianists. The rain plays its part in this analogy: So expertly she plays the chords of this difficult music she has mastered,</page><page sequence="12">192 THE GEORGIA REVIEW her wet face beautiful in its concentration, while the wind turns the pages of rain. This use of extended metaphor is not quite as easy as it may look. Every aspect of the tenor and vehicle must be synchronized so that the transformation feels complete and we can see this particular woman in a new light. Time, too, holds fascination. Much of Koosers attention to things- a jar of buttons, applesauce, necktie, pegboard, casting reels, dishwater, beaded purse, tele- scope - is really a sense of history, a wondering at who and how and what. The shadow of missing lives touches these things, charging them not with nostalgia, but respect. In separate poems called "Mother" and "Father," Kooser speaks directly to his dead parents, investing them with the dignity of their ordinary, work-filled lives. And the poems of Delights and Shadows are always more complicated than their "little events" would suggest. They emanate from the nations heartland- its solidity, its optimism, and its hint of something diminished. In their attention to detail, the past comes alive in its own precise terms: Grasshoppers This year they are exactly the size of the pencil stub my grandfather kept to mark oiF the days since rain, and precisely the color of dust, of the roads leading back across the dying fields into the '30s. Walking the cracked lane past the empty barn, the empty silo, you hear them tinkering with irony, slapping the grass like drops of rain. The poem begins with the object. Only the speaker knows the exact size of the pencil stub, and therefore the exact size of the grasshoppers, or the precise color of the dust, or the dimensions of the farm, but we are invited to participate as memory moves the speaker from present to past. We follow the dusty roads out again, past silo and barn, empty of all that activates the senses. Back in the present, the grasshoppers make their incessant sound - and it becomes the rain his grandfather waited for. The farm - with its attendant associations - is both real and imagined. Here it is: the rain that was needed. And here is the irony: its no more rain than it ever was. Ted Kooser s achievement is his rapt attention coupled with a combinatorial imagination. The cumulative effect is one of time held still in the moment of its meta- phor, examined, then put gently back in place- a bit like someone at an estate sale, savoring association. My favorite poem in the collection simultaneously expands and condenses the moment:</page><page sequence="13">JUDITH KITCHEN 193 A Washing of Hands She turned on the tap and a silver braid unraveled over her fingers. She cupped them, weighing that tassel, first in one hand and then the other, then pinched through the threads as if searching for something, perhaps an entangled cocklebur of water, or the seed of a lake. A time or two she took the tassel in both hands, squeezed it into a knot, wrung out the cold and the light, and then, at the end, pulled down hard on it twice, as if the water were a rope and she was ringing a bell to call me, two bright rings, though I was there. In one deft stroke, Ted Kooser makes his presence felt. Witness. Animator. Shadow. And delight. In his fifth collection, The Perishing , Sherod Santos employs natural images in a way that is substantially different from that of any other writer, and rain is the telling example. It first appears in the title poem as a mere suggestion: a "sound in the nettle trees" that is at once "whisper," "unsettling air adrift," "hushed and small," an "upwelling thing," and "the soft chorale / Of something unsayable slipping away." The sound acts like a gathering storm, but is really "the sound / Of our own perishing"- a knowledge of death that, once recognized, colors and informs everything, even memory. The con- nection between rain and death is made even more explicit in "A Sound like Rain": Twice tonight I awakened to the soughing sound Of rain and twice discovered it was only that, Across the street, our recently widowed neighbor Had left her garden sprinkler on, its standing water Here and there welling up over the concrete curb In loose, collected rivulets of wet, a moon-lit runoff Less like spilled water than the dispossessing ghost Of water sluicing down the gutters and away. In eight lines, the poem moves from the expansive simile of the title back to root source. In doing so, Santos uncovers another implied simile- one dictated by context and association. The ending of the second line - "it was only that" - is instructive; it simultaneously moves into the explanation of the third and fourth lines and harks back to the first, reminding us that the literal sound of rain was only a sound (like rain),</page><page sequence="14">194 THE GEORGIA REVIEW not rain itself. The focus remains on the comparison. Yet the poem is infused with a knowledge of grief. The simplicity of the subject matter is complicated by its underlying "story." The forgetfulness of the recent widow (or the inability to remember what had been her husbands domain?) leads directly to a new way of seeing the water (through her eyes?), transformed by moonlight into a "dispossessing ghost" that, even as it is observed, is rushing away. Rain, here, functions almost symbolically. It is wholly symbolic in "The Book of Blessings," a poem that encapsulates the major concerns of this collection. Written into a boys Book of Blessings: a doctor in the ER who pronounced his mother out of danger; the windfall apples at the Shaker village where his mother had gone to recover; his mothers tears; the image of Martin Luther King in 1965 in Selma, seen by the boy as he watched television in the next room; the "papery sound" of the quiet place King opened up within the crowd; songs committed to memory; plus language and the imaginary moonlit sea it conjures, the bed somehow transformed into a boat, and then his penis erect in a dream that boat Now carries him toward, a dream in which The towering secret of his begetting Is at last spelled out in the bright pearl-droplets Of a falling rain, as though the moon Were weeping on the open sea, And the sea were a body it yearned for. The poem ends with the closing down of memory, the erasure of such vivid trans- formations, and the poets impending knowledge of the books of Death, Silence, and Forgetting, thus foretelling its own perishing. Acutely aware of the disparities between memory and event, between dream and reality, between art and life, Santos explores the theoretical territory of Saussure and Derrida. He is least successful, however, when he uses the theories as referents. He is most successful when the circumstances of the poem give rise to their own philosophi- cal ruminations, as in my favorite, "Dairy Cows at Crawford Farm." A scene outside the window of an Irish В &amp; В calls up a childhood vision- "the traced illustrations / Of a nursery rhyme"- as the cows are transported from the self-conscious "particulars of a landscape" into the realm of meditation: It follows then That something within their cumbered Motions through the morning air recalls An instinct pastured where the slow, pacific Form thought takes is given time to reflect On thought: thought thinking thought, And the once unthinkable end of thought . . .</page><page sequence="15">JUDITH KITCHEN 195 There it is again: the flickering knowledge of death, tinting the present with premoni- tion. And once more, the knowledge is seen in terms of imminent rain: They move the way a slow-forming storm Cloud moves, trolling the earth out of which It draws, in the evanescence of a passing hour, A heaviness it must soon become. And yet A cow jumped over the moon, we're told . . . Cows, rain, imagination, memory, surprise, and the reality of milk all fuse into one experience, delivered (note the simile) "like gladness, on a breakfast tray." Even though Santos has returned to the image in nature on which the poem is constructed, its an image that takes on personal symbolic associations allowing the poet linguistic leeway into his imagination. Many of the poems in The Perishing are about absence. Absence as presence has long been a poetic mainstay, but Santos has added to this an intellectual overlay that calls up not only what has been lost but also its implications, often tinged with an unflinching candor. Whether it is Thomas Hardy s vision of the wife he was more devoted to after her death ("Landscape with Missing Figure"), the mother who has abandoned her family ("The Fostering"), or three untimely deaths ("Small Variations"), we are surprised by the poems cerebral weight. More potent surprise resides in the numerous poems about violence. The Per- ishing is fraught with a sense of the anxiety of our times, and these poems go to the heart of human vulnerability. Not so much intellectual as brutally explicit, they make up the books penetrating core. Both politically and personally charged, they give voice to the killers and killing fields of this world, from Tamerlane to Hitler to Pol Pot, from Rwanda to Serbia: "the wall is the wall / Of oblivion, and even if it did not exist, even if it had never existed, / Wed have had to kill them anyway, wed have had to kill them all." In "The Talking Cure," Santos presents a victim of molestation speaking to his therapist. Out of a kind of violence, he has come to understand the nature- and limits- of love, and he names its consequence: "that secret, solitary, nowhere of a place wherein / One brief fluorescing stroke a shudder of grief / And arousal struck a lifelong, inwrought, echoing chord." In finding his appropriate symbols, Santos also finds a way to dissolve differ- ences. The books final poem, "Smoke Tree," moves easily between body and mind, literally breathing in and exhaling the image. Noting that the tree "fulfills in us // the idea of a life," the speaker makes linguistic play of the "game it makes of us each spring," when even a breeze or squirrels leap will "shake down on us a sil- / Very shower of light and rain, / A chill exhilaration we quicken to," and With a goose-bumped, breathless, earth- Bound thrill the flesh transfiguring figures through</page><page sequence="16">196 THE GEORGIA REVIEW A language that imagines Our storied bodies come crisply into leaf. What saves this poem from being warmed-over James Wright is that it knows better than to break into blossom. Santos does not pretend that this happens, only that lan- guage can make it happen- and that makes all the difference. Theres humility here, and disciplined intelligence, and a sense that nature remains so unutterably other it would take more than metaphor to bridge the gap. By moving the other direction, into symbol, Sherod Santos strikes his own echoing chord. Carl Phillips' poems have a sinuous physicality, orchestrated by syntactical gestures to epitomize the jabs and feints of the meditative mind. At the same time, they convey the tentative fragility of the hinted at, the wondered about, the wished for. Because his poems proceed by syntax, they learn to accommodate their conjunctions and prepositions and adverbs; as in desire, for every "before" there is an "after." The comma becomes a way of opening up, and fending off, meaning: it refines the pattern of thought, allows for deviation, provides shading and nuance. In The Rest of Love , his seventh collection of poetry, Phillips explores- and extends - the implications of myth, concentrating on the many manifestations of desire. In doing so, he incorporates the natural world into his mythmaking (and myth-dissecting) lexicon. One is tempted to say that Phillips is the exception to Wil- liam Carlos Williams' rule: no ideas but in things. But that would not be quite accurate. For Phillips, ideas and things serve each other in near equal measure, twisting like two parallel strands into one tight rope of meaning. Unlike the objective correlative, whose image helps to translate the ineffable, the image for Phillips accompanies the ineffable, literally becoming an integral part of the thinking process. It is one element among many in an ongoing interior conversation- a springboard for thought rather than an illustration of its logic. In "The Grackle," for example, imagination activates the senses as the bird, descending from the highest branches to the ground, passes through a strobe light of conceptual intrusions. The poet finds the perfect mix of image and inquiry to capture the ephemeral, knowing that the grackle will any moment enter the very light to which what will the bird most be, then, if not the blue and bronze and black and verdigris exception -</page><page sequence="17">JUDITH KITCHEN 197 Often the image serves to ground the subjective with a sense of an exterior world. But its not that world that interests Phillips. Or the reader. Even when he gives us pinpoint descriptions of nature, as in "Like Cuttings for a Wreath of Praise and Ransom," he catches our attention with his unusually subtle discriminations: The landscape opening as if no end to it, a longing anywhere for some resistance, some stop: the magnolia, its ring of bird- ravaged seed-cones, the birds themselves, a wind lifting a collar of feathers at the neck of each - stiff courtiers, Elizabethan. Clarity, versus blur. Fine distinctions. Here the images act, in the poems own words, like a "Silo, through which / the rains, passing, / pass unimpeded," creating an interior space where the intervening mind can make its connections and qualifications and hesitant conclusions. So the rain (which is never rain) becomes a conduit for the minds unrest. In "Tower Window," nature reveals itself in parts, as though glimpsed through river water, stilled in the inquisitive mind- "I had thought so, / 1 had wanted to think so"- until it makes connections with (as opposed to reveals something of) the human: Last night, the storm was hours approaching. Too far, still, to be heard. Only the sky, when lit - less flashing than quivering brokenly (a wing, not any wing, a sparrows) - for a sign. It seemed exactly the way I've loved you. The impending storm (a frequent image throughout the book) serves as backdrop, an external manifestation of the poems true concern: the "way" he has loved, now given physical expression via the storms sporadic lightning. The image is clearly transitional,</page><page sequence="18">198 THE GEORGIA REVIEW helping the poem move between what are essentially inner emotional or psychologi- cal states: And you a stone, marked Gone Already- you a leaf marked Spattered Milk in that light, then out of. Phillips usually evokes a state of being rather than a specific geography. The mind is a landscape; thought is fleetingly connected to- but not grounded in- place. Language is saved from insubstantiality by image or simile, but the images themselves remain remarkably general: water, shore, light. The sea, for example, becomes pucker, then bloom, then sprawl, then interruption, "a thing undoing itself," until, in "Sunset, With Severed Head of Orpheus," as if to wrest it back from language, the poet asserts, "the sea was itself / not watered silk." That poem articulates the underlying issue: how for every image, there's the rest of the world, where everything but, it seems, that image turns, contained. This also applies to love, where the distances are twofold: those caught between what is said and what is understood, and those divided by what is told from what is withheld. In the end, lovers must adjust to, and recognize, their separateness, falling distinctly, as in "Aubade: Some Peaches, After Storm," so that "each / is its own, now." The Rest of Love is passionately passionate, but it is a passion tempered with analysis. Heart and head are inextricable, even as the speaker would like to extri- cate himself, even as he resists- and confronts- the instinct to probe his own logic. Simultaneously alive and isolated in language, Phillips always confronts an immediate paradox: his poems desperately desire union even as they chronicle the private, often lonely, voice of the individual. This book is permeated by what Andrei Voznesensky calls "nostalgia for the present." The present is informed not by the past but by the mythic, so the future is foreseeable- a future in which the present moment is already falling away, already diminished. Love, too, is time-bound even as its impulse is toward timelessness. Note the awareness of time in this passage from "Here, On Earth": Only days ago, the peonies opened- and already- just look at them: group portrait</page><page sequence="19">JUDITH KITCHEN 199 of a winter river the thaw has touched, and now takes hold of- and soon must possess entirely. In "White Dog," the speaker releases the dog into snow, knowing she will not return, as though one part of love is the capacity to let it go. The books title poem examines the impulse to encapsulate desire, to make something of what has faded, and ends with Orpheus and the clear implication that what is lost can become the impetus for art. "Fray" extends this insight to encompass language itself: The words themselves over time coming to matter the way, in painting, color does: less, finally, than the gesture each stroke memorializes. Ultimately, Phillips resists even gesture as he pares experience to its "knowable" essen- tials. This is never more clear than in his quest for God. But if there is a God here, its an elusive one, and Phillips settles somewhat restively for doubt. He keeps returning to the human body, the human need to give "shapelessness / a form." The Rest of Love gives us Phillips at the height of his powers. To read this book is to take a deep step into pleasure, "this far in" (where language is immaterial) as the poem of that title urges us, resisting memory (which is a form of ownership) in favor of desire- "without which // would there have been / imagination?" If Carl Phillips had not come onto the scene, we would have needed to invent him. His idiosyncratic style, his innovative method, and his unique voice are essential steps in the evolution of the craft. These poems pass, unimpeded, into the water table of American poetry.</page></plain_text>
