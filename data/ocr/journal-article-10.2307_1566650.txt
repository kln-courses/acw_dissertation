<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSEPH SOLOVEITCHIK AND IMMANUEL KANT'S MITZVAH-AESTHETIC by ZACHARY BRAITERMAN In the following pages, I will address the relationship between Jewish thought and aesthetics by bringing Joseph Soloveitchik into conversation with Immanuel Kant, whose Critique of Judgment remains an imposing monument in the history of philosophical aesthetics. While Buber and Rosenzweig may have been more accomplished aesthetes, Soloveitchik's aesthetic proves closer to Kant's own. In particular, I draw upon the latter's distinction between the beautiful and the sublime and the notion of a form of indeterminate purposiveness without determinate purpose. I will relate these three figures to Soloveitcchik's understanding of halakhah and to the ideal of performing commandments for their own sake (li-shemah). The model of mitzvah advanced by this comparison is quintessentially modem: an autonomous, self-contained, formal system that does not (immediately) point to extraneous goods, such as spiritual enlightenment, personal morality, or social ethics. The good presupposed by this system proves first and foremost "aesthetic." That is, immanent ,to the system. Supererogatory goods enter into the picture only afterward as second-order effects. This proposed coupling of Kant and Soloveitchik involves two fundamental ironies. The first involves Kant, whose Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone promoted a thoroughgoing critique of statutory religion. Indeed, scholars who trace Kant's impact on modem Jewish thought generally sidestep his understanding of statutes, not to mention his aesthetics. Instead they turn to the First and Second Critiques to explore epistemology and ethics. Kant, it would seem, offered no help in figuring why modem Jewish people (might) observe mitzvah. But what if a possible response appears in the Third Critique? Against AJS Review 25/1 (2000/2001): 1-24 1</page><page sequence="2">2 ZACHARY BRAITERMAN Kant, this would mean looking at the system of mitzvot less as a juridical body of statute and law. Halakhah in this respect would fall under the purview of aesthetic judgments, providing that the performance of mitzvot occasions aesthetic judgment and its attendant pleasures. This presents an understanding of mitzvah that both Kant and Soloveitchik would have resisted, but one that is suggested by reading both thinkers in tandem. Our second irony involves using Soloveitchik to examine the aesthetic dimension of mitzvah when a fundamental ambivalence characterizes his approach to the topic. On one hand, theological, cognitive, ethical, and aesthetic considerations fall into a loose hierarchy in which the aesthetic occupies the lowest rung. In contrast to scientific cognition and ethics, aesthetic life provides the lowest level of human culture. On the other hand, the cognitive and the ethical will share this bottom rung with the aesthetic when they are all contrasted in toto against revelation. In other words, the combined fruits of culture pale in comparison to revealed commandments. Either way, the aesthetic thread that will interest us most remains largely subordinate and even hidden throughout Soloveitchik's texts. I will nevertheless argue that precisely this aesthetic thread proves to be a compelling, if unintended, legacy to modem Jewish thought. Throughout the primary literature, readers find explicit and interlocking theological, cognitive, and ethical claims about mitzvah: (1) The essence of mitzvah emanates from divine will and understanding; and therefore, halakhic cognition equals cleaving to the mind of God.' (2) Halakhah constitutes an a priori cognitive grid (on a par with those provided in the theoretical sciences) by which halakhic persons constitute reality. (3) Performing mitzvot morally refines the individual and unifies the Jewish people into a covenantal community. The tact accorded Soloveitchik throughout the secondary literature cannot obscure the suspicion that these theological, ethical, and even cognitive threads may indeed fray under 1.

Readers will find particularly acute analyses of these claims in the work of Aviezer Ravitzky, David Singer and Moshe Sokol, Shalom Carmy, and especially Lawrence Kaplan.2 In the meantime, reading Soloveitchik against the grain and in light of Kant's aesthetic suggests three simpler and perhaps more enduring claims about mitzvah than the ones Soloveitchik's own explicit statements presuppose. They are: mitzvot are beautiful, they are sublime, and one performs them first and foremost for their own sake alone-not for the supposed spiritual, cognitive, and ethical effects that Soloveitchik takes for granted.3 Soloveitchik, Kant, and Aesthetics Both Ravitzky and Singer and Sokol have noted the ambivalence underriding Soloveitchik's explicitly stated comments regarding aesthetics. This ambivalence takes the form of qualified affirmation, hostile parody, and relative indifference.4 Note how he begins Part Three of The Halakhic Mind, affirming "homo religiosus" as an aesthetic creature. Against Maimonides, Soloveitchik upholds the liturgical use of poetic element and anthropomorphic metaphor for the warmth and color they provide the God-human relationship. He describes the worshipper "lured on irresistibly, from time to time by grotesquely 2. Aviezer Ravitzky, "Rabbi J. B. Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge: Between Maimonidean and Neo-Kantian Philosophy," Modern Judaism 6, no. 2 (May 1986); David Singer and Moshe Sokol, "Joseph Soloveitchik: Lonely Man of Faith," Modern Judaism 2 (1982); Shalom Carmy, "Pluralism and the Category of the Ethical," in Exploring the Thought of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, ed. Marc D. Angel; Lawrence Kaplan, "Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik's Philosophy of Halakhah," Jewish Law Annual 7 (1988). 3. I stake this argument with and against Singer and Sokol. On one hand, Soloveitchik's own explicit claims about halakhah sit at odds with modem philosophy. On the other hand, the modernism underlying Soloveitchik's implicit aesthetic runs deeper than Singer and Sokol allow or even Soloveitchik himself may have recognized. 4. Cf. Ravitzky, "Rabbi J. B. Soloveitchik on Human Knowledge," p.186, n. 85. According to Ravitzky, the aesthetic realm may include the entire world of "majestic man," the entire world of human culture, not excluding political and judicial leadership. On the other hand, according to Ravitzky, the aesthetic is also seen by Soloveitchik as constituting a primary, precognitive natural stage that precedes majesty. Cf. Singer and Sokol, "Joseph Soloveitchik," pp. 251-52. Singer and Sokol note Soloveitchik's affirmation and rejection of aesthetics, but not the indifference.</page><page sequence="4">4 ZACHARY BRAITERMAN anthropomorphic and figurative attributes." After all, homo religiosus "moves in a concrete world full of color and sound."5 Having said this, however, Soloveitchik proceeds to describe the religious person as a cognitive creature, no longer swayed by the abstruse sentiment or ephemeral feelings that characterize the aesthete.6 From this point on in The Halakhic Mind, Soloveitchik says next to nothing positive about the religious subject as an aesthetic creature. Aesthetics and aestheticism now assume pejorative connotations. In this text, as in others, aesthetics assumes a precognitive value, but one that is overridden by ethics, cognition, and religion.7 At worst, the notion of autonomous aesthetic life, unfettered by moral constraint, constitutes a purely negative phenomenon. In the essay "Confrontation," Soloveitchik describes the biblical Na'amah as the fairest of women seducing the sons of the Nephilim. Her attractions provoke an appalling disregard for the divine norm prohibiting men from taking that which does not belong to them [sic]. In this deeply gendered account, the aesthetic here takes the form of unethicized, unredeemed beauty inflicting "untold harm upon a holy nation and kingdom of priests."8 For the most part, however, Soloveitchik's attitude is nonplussed. He neither condemns nor affirms aesthetic life. In "U- viqashtem mi-sham," one finds Soloveitchik referring to the aesthetic in the same breath as ethics and speculation. This allows speculation, ethics, and aesthetics (always in that order) to sit alongside each other as interlinking facets of "ontological man." Taken together, they form into "a complete and variegated totality" that represents a rich gamut of ontological religious experience over against revelatory experience.9 5.

In this description of halakhic cognition, the halakhist begins aesthetically, dimly "sensing" halakhic ideas as if they were "contents of sound, sight, and smell." These fragmentary insights are then linked by the halakhist into a clear chain of cognitive knowledge. 8. Joseph Soloveitchik, "Confrontation," Tradition 6, no. 2 (Spring-Summer 1964): 7-8. 9.

Indeed, Kant argued that aesthetic judgment (a subjective act by which we assert that something is beautiful or sublime) does not work according to objectively determinate concepts or lawfulness. Halakhah, in contrast, forms an objective order based on set concepts, principles, and laws. One must respect but not overstate this basic difference. Take, for instance, the description in Kant's Third Critique: "[an] aesthetic judgment . . . refers the presentation, by which an object is given, solely to the subject; it brings to our notice no characteristic of the object."'1 In other words, aesthetics involves purely subjective judgments that say nothing objective about objects. This would then seem to contradict Soloveitchik's understanding of halakhah and its objectifying structures. However, Kant continued, "[aesthetic judgment] brings to our notice no characteristic of the object, but only the purposive form in the [way] the presentational powers are determined in their engagement with the object."" Three points bridge the gap between Kant's subject-oriented aesthetic and the objective structures of halakhic consciousness. First, what Kant called the presentational powers (including the Understanding qua seat of objective concepts) play an important role in forming aesthetic judgment. Second, aesthetic judgment falls under a particular, albeit indeterminate concept of purposiveness by which human subjects presuppose purposes that they cannot fathom. Third, we will see below that aesthetic judgments (even though they do not operate according to determinate concepts) assume the form of statements whose subject holds them universally valid. Turning to Soloveitchik shows an understanding of mitzvah implicitly reflecting the very aestheticism that it supposedly supersedes. But we must be clear. By aestheticism we do not mean the untrammeled hedonism polemically parodied by Soloveitchik in "Confrontation." After all, most artists, more often than not, attribute moral, religious, social, or political significance to artistic 10. Immanuel Kant, Critique of Judgment, translated by Werner S. Pluhar (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1987), p. 75. 11. Ibid.</page><page sequence="6">6 ZACHARY BRAITERMAN creation. Instead, we follow Kant's distinction between aesthetic judgment per se and "the agreeable." By the latter Kant meant "what the senses like in sensation."12 This includes purely subjective liking, as in the case of a particular person's happening to enjoy certain wines, the color violet, or the sound of wind instruments. These, according to Kant, are merely agreeable, but not technically beautiful, since they cannot compel universal assent.13 In contrast, aesthetic means the human mind making judgments about the beautiful and the sublime. It means sense intuition combining with concepts of the Understanding and ideas of Reason to form those judgments. These judgments are autonomous vis- A-vis the real world of physical objects. At the same time, the human subjects who make these judgments do not hold them as subjective whim. According to Kant, you expect me to agree with you when you judge something to be beautiful or sublime (as opposed to merely "agreeable"). Aesthetic judgments fall under the forms of universal validity but indeterminate lawfulness. As such, they escape the determinate definitions that one expects from the sciences. The universal sense of lawfulness these judgments assume is aesthetic, not cognitive. The same holds true of the descriptions of mitzvah that follow. The Beautiful In one of his five derashot (sermons) delivered to the Mizrachi movement, Soloveitchik attacks non-Orthodox Jews for wanting to enjoy the aesthetic beauty of Judaism while ignoring its halakhic discipline. Judaism is said to combine the aesthetic spirit of Sarah with the disciplined spirit of Abraham. Soloveitchik compares non-halakhic Jews to the scoffers in the Midrash who ridiculed Sarah's delivering Isaac. These are the mockers of the generation, since their entire system is mockery. The Jewish soul requires that they approach Abraham as well as Sarah..... Of course, there is much beauty in Judaism, much spiritedness, much majesty and 12. Ibid., p. 47. 13. Ibid., p. 55.</page><page sequence="7">JOSEPH SOLOVEITCHIK AND IMMANUEL KANT 7 depth. However, the beginning of wisdom: [Judaism] is a way of life of self- control and self-discipline.14 No doubt, this sharp distinction between beauty and discipline makes more polemical sense than theoretical. Soloveitchik makes use of it in order to challenge non-halakhic Jews to accept "Abraham" along with "Sarah" or reject both in toto. But in drawing this line in the sand between beauty and discipline, he misrepresents both. Indeed, in his own thought, the beauty of Jewish life lies precisely in halakhic discipline. Soloveitchik refers repeatedly throughout Halakhic Man to the beauty of mitzvot and of the behavior of those who study and uphold them. In one passage, he compares halakhic system building to the mathematical elegance of scientific constructs. Soloveitchik explicitly states that these latter surpass the works of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. One can safely assume that he thought no less of halakhah. To be sure, he respects the dictum attributed to R. Jacob in Pirqe Avot that "He who walks by the way and studies and breaks off his study and says, 'How beautiful is this tree, how beautiful is this plowed field,' Scripture counts it to him as if he committed a mortal sin" (3:7). But Soloveitchik does not reject aesthetic rapture as much as he founds it upon halakhic cognition. He counsels only against interrupting the very studies that allow one to hear "the tones of amor Dei intellectualis . . . reverberating here. And indeed, how beautiful is the echo of these tones, if the God for whom man longs is the living God and not an impersonal, infinite substance, imprinted with the stamp of necessity."15 Take as another example Soloveitchik's description of the moral purism of R. Ilayyim of Brisk in aesthetic terms. Two men die, one poor, one rich, the one before the other. With none to plead for the poor man, the burial society prepared to bury the rich man out of turn. The poor man found his advocate in R. IIayyim. Earning many enemies in the process, R. Ijayyim forced the burial society to bury the poor man in the order prescribed by halakhah. Soloveitchik 14.

These two examples reflect a vague resemblance to Kant's aesthetic. Both consider or involve acts of aesthetic judgment: on when and whether to call this tree or that field beautiful, on judging an ethical-halakhic act beautiful. We also note from the passage cited above that the idea of a living God conforms to free beauty insofar as it does not conform to the stamp of necessity. By and large, however, these references express a general aestheticism with little to do with Kant's more technical understanding of aesthetic judgment in the Third Critique. Compare, in contrast, the instance in Halakhic Man where Soloveitchik describes the observant Jew cognizing laws regarding Shabbat and encountering a sunset on Yom Kippur. Given the importance of this passage, I quote liberally: If a Jew cognizes for example, the Sabbath laws and the precepts concerning the sanctity of the day in all their particulars, if he comprehends. .. the basic principles of Torah law ... then he will perceive the sunset of a Sabbath eve not only as a natural cosmic phenomenon but as an unsurpassably awe- inspiring, sacred, and exalted vision-an eternal sanctity that is reflected in the setting of the sun. I remember how once, on the Day of Atonement, I went outside into the synagogue courtyard with my father ... just before the Ne'ilah service. It had been a fresh, clear day, one of the fine, almost delicate days of summer's end, filled with sunshine and light. Evening was fast approaching, and an exquisite autumn sun was sinking into the west, beyond the trees of the cemetery, into a sea of purple and gold. R. Moses, a halakhic man par excellence, turned to me and said: "This sunset differs from ordinary sunsets for with it forgiveness is bestowed upon us for our sins.". . . The Day of Atonement and the forgiveness of sins merged and blended here with the splendor and beauty of the world and with the hidden lawfulness of the order of creation and the whole was transformed into one living, holy, cosmic phenomenon.17 16. Ibid., p. 95. 17. Ibid., p. 38.</page><page sequence="9">JOSEPH SOLOVEITCHIK AND IMMANUEL KANT 9 Clearly, this passage shows a general aestheticism. Sabbath and Yom Kippur are clothed in light, color, and warmth. They reflect the passage of time and the intimation of death. This sets an excited mood that wafts simultaneously sweet and melancholic before the order of creation transformed into a holy work of art. But if these general comments exhaust the description, we could commend Soloveitchik for his romantic prose and turn to "more serious" epistemological and ontological issues. In fact, this description of sunsets, Sabbaths, and Yom Kippur resonates (consciously or not) with Kant's more technical understanding of beauty. Before we begin to analyze this passage it is important to review two basic points. First, Kant's formalism does not preclude feeling insofar as aesthetic judgment involves pleasure. The next thing to remember concerns Kant's philosophical psychology. Kant distinguished three faculties of the human mind: Imagination, Understanding, and Reason. Imagination is the faculty by which the mind arranges sense impressions. The Understanding is the active faculty of the mind that orders these sense impressions into an organized and coherent pattern according to concepts. The "concepts of the Understanding" (e.g., unity, plurality, totality, causality) correspond to no external reality. They are but tools by which the mind organizes the manifold of sense impression into an ordered whole. Lastly, Reason posits these ordered impressions under the overarching ideational postulates of God, world, and soul. The "ideas of Reason" have a more ambiguous relationship to external reality. On the one hand, they are postulates of pure Reason. On the other hand, Kant accepted the possibility that God, world, and soul refer to real external referents, even if we can know absolutely nothing about them. In either case, the ideas of Reason along with the concepts of the Understanding subsist first and foremost in a self-contained cognitive system of internal reference. According to Kant, the pleasure taken in judging things beautiful is likewise self-contained. In judging something beautiful, the human subject says nothing about the object. Rather, the pleasure one takes in judging an object beautiful results from the Imagination (which provides a determinate sense- impression of the object) entering into a harmonious, free play with the concepts of the Understanding. As such, the external object serves as an occasion that sets the mind into motion. By way of example, Kant included, "designs 'a la grecque, the foliage on borders or on wallpaper, etc., [which] mean nothing on</page><page sequence="10">10 ZACHARY BRAITERMAN their own: they represent nothing, no object under a determinate concept, and are free beauties."18 Remembering Soloveitchik's own reference to the grotesque, we continue quoting Kant: That is why the English taste in gardens, or the baroque taste in furniture carries the imagination's freedom very far, even to the verge of the grotesque, because it is precisely in this divorce from any constant rule that the case is posited where taste can show its greatest perfection in designs made by the imagination.19 Kant also included "the changing shapes of the flames in a fireplace or of a rippling brook: neither of these are [technically] beauties, but they still charm the imagination because they sustain its free play."20 In each case Kant referred to objects that stimulate the Imagination and concepts of the Understanding in tandem. They interact outside of the precise determination with which concepts are applied in forming strictly cognitive judgments. Following the design of a baroque or a" la grecque pattern allows the Understanding to roam freely (for example) from the category of unity to that of limitation, to possibility, to impossibility. In short, concepts freely intermingle with sense-impressions following no particular principle, necessity, program, or interest. The pleasure that Soloveitchik takes in the performance of a mitzvah follows suit, except that here the concepts of the Understanding are halakhic. Performing a mitzvah sets the mind in motion, placing sense impressions into a free play with the concepts of the halakhic understanding. Sunset, trees, and cemetery intermingle with Sabbath and Yom Kippur laws and precepts in the description cited above. The mind roams from particular halakhot to the concepts of forgiveness, creation, and holiness as they intermingle with the setting of the sun, the architecture of a synagogue courtyard, and the unfolding landscape that lies before Soloveitchik and his father. This allows Soloveitchik to judge the order of the world as "living, holy, cosmic." Aesthetic judgment is 18. Kant, Critique ofJudgment, pp. 76-77. 19. Ibid., p. 93. 20. Ibid., p. 95.</page><page sequence="11">JOSEPH SOLOVEITCHIK AND IMMANUEL KANT 11 predicated on halakhah: that is, laws, precepts, and all of their particulars. The lush proliferation and formal arrangement of halakhic concepts and natural sense impressions stimulate mental pleasure. Indeed, it is no wonder that Soloveitchik returns again and again to describe the life of mitzvah and its study in terms of "delight."21 A lack of pretension, even a tautological elegance, informs a picture in which one observes a mitzvah because it is a mitzvah, because it is beautiful. In this description, Soloveitchik does not set out to show how mitzvot generate goods external to the system. This suggests the following. Soloveitchik's own theological understanding of mitzvah may wobble on fideistic claims about the mind of God. Comparing halakhah and the theoretical sciences may prove not a little disingenuous. Ethical claims probably hold out unrealizable hopes that performing mitzvah might morally refine the individual and unify Jewish society into a covenantal community. In contrast, an aesthetic understanding of mitzvah does not refer the halakhic mind to a set of external goods and goals. Rather, it remains entirely self-referential. Mitzvot and sense impressions point only to each other. This aestheticism, therefore, remains immune to criticisms of the type leveled against Soloveitchik in the critical literature. As Kant himself understood, it is impossible to argue over aesthetic judgment. Arguments rely on concepts. Since no determinate concept applies to aesthetic pleasures, there can be no real argument about them. Likewise, there can be no real argument about the ultimate purpose in performing mitzvot. This will strike many critical readers as being just as fideistic as Soloveitchik's theological argument except for one difference. It is one thing to judge a mitzvah-performance beautiful. It is quite another to suggest that its essence "emanates" from divine will and intelligence. This, of course, does not mean that a commanding divine presence does not contribute to an aesthetic understanding of mitzvah. We would only observe that God does not figure into the technical "beauty" presented in Soloveitchik's picture of Shabbat and Yom Kippur. Indeed, Kant brings God (qua idea of 21. See Soloveitchik, Halakhic Man, p. 65; "U-viqashtem mi-sham," p. 222; Halakhic Mind, p. 98. Singer and Sokol seem to miss the aspect of pleasure underlying Soloveitchik's understanding of mitzvah. They argue that Soloveitchik never integrates intellect and affect in his understanding of Jewish life, an argument that I find unpersuasive. Singer and Sokol, "Joseph Soloveitchik," pp. 256-63.</page><page sequence="12">12 ZACHARY BRAITERMAN Reason and the real presence this idea may or may not reflect) into the analytic of the sublime, not into the analytic of the beautiful; and so too Soloveitchik. The Sublime The sublime represents the second leg of Kant's aesthetics, acting in tandem with the beautiful. In both cases, the intuition of external phenomena stimulates the mind and generates pleasure. But here, the act of aesthetic judgment provides the human subject with "negative" pleasure. In judging an object beautiful, the Imagination's intuition of that object enters into play with the concepts of the Understanding. This falls within the scope of human comprehension. In the case of judging something sublime, Imagination refers the mind to the ideas of Reason (God, world, soul) whose apprehension lies beyond the limits of sense. What Kant called the "mathematical sublime" refers to the absolutely and infinitely large in nature. Judging an object mathematically sublime means experiencing the inability of our Imagination to bring an absolutely large representation into a single intuition. At the same time, Reason demands what it is impossible to sense. The negative pleasure in judging something mathematically sublime, therefore, consists in this. Judging an object sublime generates a feeling of respect, not for the external object, but for the power of our own Reason to seek and proceed toward an infinity that lies beyond its sense. More important to this study of Soloveitchik is what Kant called the "dynamic sublime" (the act of judging natural phenomena in terms of might and power). The human subject now discovers its physical impotence before nature. Physiological power and sensual need are reduced to naught before the compelling power of nature. At the same time (and herein lies the pleasure in judging nature dynamically sublime), the subject discovers the superiority of Reason and moral principle over the nature within us and the, nature without. Ultimately, Kant insisted, the experience of sublimity shows Reason equal even before God. As such, he disassociated the attitude of fear and trembling on the part of homo religiosus from the experience of sublimity. Only if [homo religiosus] is conscious that his attitude is sincere and pleasing to God, will these effects of [divine] might serve to arouse in him the idea of</page><page sequence="13">JOSEPH SOLOVEITCHIK AND IMMANUEL KANT 13 God's sublimity. ... [H]e recognizes in his own attitude a sublimity that conforms to God's will, and is thereby elevated above any fear of such natural effect, which he does not regard as outbursts of God's wrath.22 A roughly similar insight works its way into Soloveitchik's understanding of mitzvah. The experience of revelation also provides "negative" pleasure. First, the human person confronts the limiting experience of compulsion. Soloveitchik makes this point repeatedly in "U-viqashtem mi-sham." This distinguishes what he calls revelatory experience from ontological experience. The human person must submit before an overpowering divine presence that makes absolute demands. So far we are with Kant (for whom the human subject confronts representations mathematically too vast for one to intuit and a dynamic power before which one proves physically impotent). At the same time, for Soloveitchik as well as for Kant, the human subject remains sublimely confident in its own powers-in the ability to proceed toward an infinity that it can never reach, in its own moral power before the nature within and the nature without, in the ability to create new worlds by rendering law. Kant, we know, insisted on the autonomy of human reason and morality. Indeed, judgments regarding the sublime presuppose a secure subject. Kant wrote, "We can... consider an object fearful without being afraid ofit. .. Thus a virtuous person fears God without being afraid of him. . . [The sight of a sublime object] becomes all the more attractive the more fearful it is, provided we are in a safe place."23 For his part, Soloveitchik offers "halakhic man" no less security and confidence. A first example comes from Halakhic Man. We take it from Part One, section XIII, and identify it as a high point of the text. In section XI, halakhah was said to constitute the third term resolving the antinomy between lowliness and loftiness. In section XII, Soloveitchik showed mighty and stoic men, bristling with halakhic armament, who master the fear of turbulence and death. Now, in section XIII, Soloveitchik's expands his rhetorical powers to offer this sublime vista of halakhic creativity: 22. Kant, Critique ofJudgment, pp. 122-123. 23. Ibid., pp. 119-120.</page><page sequence="14">14 ZACHARY BRAITERMAN Halakhic man received the Torah from Sinai not as a simple recipient but as a creator of worlds, as a partner with the Almighty in the act of creation. .. . The essence of the Torah is intellectual creativity. .... The whole of transcendental existence is subjugated to him and under his sway. He creates supernal, exalted worlds and destroys them. "Know that which is higher mimkha ['than you' or 'from you']" (Avot 2:1). All reality higher than our lowly world is from you; it exists by virtue of man's creative power. Know that [that] which is higher from you!24 I am not sure why Soloveitchik begins the next section (Part One, section XIV) of our text by asking whether "halakhic man" lacks the splendor, rage, and tempestuousness of homo religiosus.25 After all, he has just finished exulting in the halakhic person's own extraordinary powers, powers that ultimately overwhelm what Kant called the nature within and the nature without; powers that ultimately prove equal before God's own. The halakhic person stands before the infinite power of divine creation and revelation, building fences beyond the power of angels, creating and destroying worlds. Kant himself could not have accorded greater dignity to a human subject in the face of the sublime. At this apex, "halakhic man" exults in his own powers. But even this epiphany ends. As the text now unfolds, Soloveitchik must bring his reader back from this peak point. In sections XIV-XV, he reminds his reader that such heights are afforded only after the careful and sober cognition that characterizes halakhic reasoning. Soloveitchik affirms stable religious experience, not the fleeting ephemera of homo religiosus. Indeed, after the torrent of words culminating in section XIII, Soloveitchik returns to the reticence of "halakhic men" who do not waste time with songs and hymns.26 Now he points to the centrality of this-worldly justice and the courageous pursuit after it.27 Rather than tempt his reader with the awesome powers that are the fi-ruits afforded halakhic abstraction, Soloveitchik insists that one must study halakhah li-shemah 24. Soloveitchik, Halakhic Man, pp. 81-82. 25. Ibid., p. 82. 26. Ibid., pp. 82-88. To be sure, section XIV does not lack for aesthetic descriptions of its own. See pp. 83-84. That's where Soloveitchik insists that from the midst of mathematical-scientific law issues "a cosmos more [sublime] and beautiful than all the works of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo." 27. Ibid., pp. 89-95.</page><page sequence="15">JOSEPH SOLOVEITCHIK AND IMMANUEL KANT 15 ("for its own sake"). It is here that Soloveitchik recounts the story cited above about R. I;ayyim of Brisk defending a dead man's rights. Stepping back a moment allows one to chart the following movement in Part One of Halakhic Man. Soloveitchik takes the reader from the beauty of Shabbat and Yom Kippur to the halakhic sublime and back to judging the beauty of halakhic ethics. Note, however, that this ethical thrust, the notion that "halakhic men" study and observe halakhah li-shemah, does not annul aesthetic judgment. Indeed, the very ethical rigor of studying and observing the law li- shemah constitutes a third aesthetic thread in its own right-one found in Kant's system and in the theoretical canons of modern, abstract art. Li-shemah The need to return to mundane ethical duties explains the polemic against poetry, psalms, and piyyutim in Part One, section XIV of Halakhic Man. "Halakhic men" do not waste time with them. Instead, they pursue the study of Torah and halakhah li-shemah. Soloveitchik describes how his own father would study halakhah during the Days of Awe rather than recite piyyutim with the congregation. This behavior epitomized the point that "the study of the Torah is not a means to another end, but is the end point of all desires. It is the most fundamental principle of all."28 In this passage, Soloveitchik even seems to elevate study over against the value of cleaving to God. Citing R. Hayyim of Volozhin, Soloveitchik writes: "The primary purpose of study is not to study simply for the sake of cleaving to God, but to comprehend, through the Torah, the commandments and laws and to know each and every matter clearly."29 According to this line of argument, mitzvot bear no mystical intentions. One must perform mitzvot for their own sake, for the sake of mitzvah.30 Soloveitchik shows himself to be a stem moralist in such passages. Readers of philosophy will in turn recognize in Soloveitchik Kant's ethical purism. To be sure, even Kant postulated a final summum bonum after death where virtue 28. Ibid., p. 87. 29. Ibid., p. 88. 30. Ibid., pp. 59-60.</page><page sequence="16">16 ZACHARY BRAITERMAN received its just reward. Nor did Soloveitchik dismiss the spiritual rewards attending halakhic study. But at the level of motivating principle, both Kant and Soloveitchik insist that one perform one's duty for its own sake, not to benefit from extraneous material or spiritual goods. However, in turning to the ethical ideal of pursuing a mitzvah li-shemah, Soloveitchik (unwittingly, I think) trespassed into the aesthetic. After all, the force of performing one's duty for its own sake resonates with ideas about aesthetics in the Critique ofJudgment. According to Kant, judgments regarding beauty are necessarily "disinterested." That is, the pleasure we take in objects judged beautiful has nothing to do with our interest in whether they actually exist in nature as objective entities. Hence his examples: "Flowers, free designs, lines aimlessly intertwined and called foliage: these have no significance, depend on no determinate concept, and yet we like them."31 Of course, we also take pleasure in the agreeable and the good. But these are distinguished from the beautiful in terms of the active interest that we take in the actual existence of objects judged agreeable and good. "We may say that, of all these three kinds of liking, only the liking involved in taste for the beautiful is disinterested and free, since we are not compelled to give our approval by any interest, whether of sense or of reason."32 In other words, we like objects judged beautiful, not because of the interest sensual appetites or ideas of reason take in them. We like them solely for their own sake. This disinterestedness bears upon the idea that one should study and perform mitzvot for their own sake. Soloveitchik repeats over and over in The Halakhic Mind that halakhic concepts carry no necessary relation to the world of external objects, that they exist independently of them. The examples of the Sabbath and Yom Kippur described above would be a case in point. The halakhic person does not observe them because they involve the same type of physical gratification as eating or drinking. To use Kant's term, that would make their observance "agreeable" (i.e., hedonistic, not aesthetic). But neither are Sabbath and Yom Kippur "intrinsically good" or even "indirectly good" in 31. Kant, Critique ofJudgment, p. 49. 32. Ibid., p. 52.</page><page sequence="17">JOSEPH SOLOVEITCHIK AND IMMANUEL KANT 17 the sense meant by Kant. After all, Kant saw that the idea of the good demands a sense of determinate purpose.3 Once one assigns determinate moral purpose to aesthetic judgment, it loses its autonomy. It then serves goods external to it. This insight holds as true for Soloveitchik as it does for Kant. According to our author, the ethical assumes a subordinate position over against the autonomous value of religion and halakhah. As Carmy notes, ethics and halakhah overlap in Soloveitchik's writings, representing separate and distinct realms of value.34 Carmy makes the stronger point that Soloveitchik seems "oblivious" to ethics as an independent source of commitment.3 The likely reason has to do with securing the autonomy of halakhah. Note why Soloveitchik rejects Maimonides' theory regarding the historical origins and moral telos of the mitzvot. "The net result of Maimonides' rationalization is that religion no longer operates with unique autonomous norms, but with technical rules, the employment of which culminates in the attainment of some extraneous maximum bonum" (emphasis added).36 For instance, the rationalist argues that God prohibits perjury because it violates the norms of truth. But to Soloveitchik this means turning religion into the handmaid of ethics; that is, religion assumes a merely instrumental value defined by higher ends. With this in view, we better understand why Soloveitchik calls social justice "mundane."37 Ethics may never trump halakhah lest the latter lose its autonomous value. Rather than insist on their moral utility, Soloveitchik frequently maintains that the study and performance of mitzvot are "delightful." In one description, he implores his readers to consider that 33. Ibid., pp. 48-49. 34. Carmy, "Pluralism and the Category of the Ethical," p. 331: 35. Ibid., p. 333. 36. Soloveitchik, Halakhic Mind, p. 93. Soloveitchik's interest in autonomy shifts from text to text. In The Halakhic Mind, he compares halakhah with the autonomy of science. In the essay "Confrontation," he defends Judaism as a "totally independent faith community" over against the common cultural ethos of what he calls a "Judeo-Hellenistic-Christian tradition." 37. Ibid. Note too the peculiar phraseology in "Confrontation," pp. 20-21. Soloveitchik caps off a discussion of the Jew's comrimitment to "the general welfare and progress of mankind" with the distinctly nonchalant "et cetera."</page><page sequence="18">18 ZACHARY BRAITERMAN the revealed law is man's delight and only comfort. He serves the Holy One Blessed be He out of love. .... Cleaving absorbs within it the absolute, suprarational, supranatural command. Does not man elevate himself by laying tefillin? ... Does not man feel the happiness of an additional soul on Shabbat? Does he not enjoy tranquility on Sabbaths and joy on holidays? Does not observing mitzvot constitute an experience that sweetens the bitterness in man's life, purifying and redeeming him from his grief, from his loneliness and mourning? Indeed, the more the lawful character is "deprived" of reason and apparent explanation, the more it gladdens the heart [emphasis added].38 Here and elsewhere, Soloveitchik describes the delight that the "halakhic man" takes in performing mitzvot, especially those without apparent rhyme or reason. By describing the halakhic life and its pleasures, Soloveitchik means to defend the autonomy of halakhic ethics against Kant's critique that statutory religion is heteronomous. This repeats the traditional notion that serving God through fear and compulsion turns into serving God through love. First one accepts divine law under compulsion and then accepts it as if it were equal to one's own creative reason. Law thereby loses its heteronomous quality as it merges with freely chosen will.39 I do not want to make too much of this argument except to note how this bald appeal to halakhic pleasure smoothes the divide between ethics and aesthetics. No appeals are made to external standards like God or the Good. The normative demand to perform halakhic duties li-shemah resonates with the pleasure one takes in performing beautiful acts that transcend rational purpose. This may represent a ta 'am, a reason for observing mitzvot. However, the purpose is internal, not external, to the performance of the mitzvah. Aesthetics, Moral/Spiritual Good, and Mitzvah So far, we have examined three aesthetic threads (the beauty, sublimity, and autonomy of the halakhic act) that run through Soloveitchik's thought. A full- blown understanding of mitzvah based upon Kant's aesthetic and the aesthetic thread in Soloveitchik's thought would posit a self-contained system. The 38. Soloveitchik, "U-viqashtem mi-sham," p. 222. 39. Cf. Soloveitchik, Halakhic Man, pp. 64-65.</page><page sequence="19">JOSEPH SOLOVEITCHIK AND IMMANUEL KANT 19 mitzvot in such a system do not directly or unambiguously point those who observe them to supererogatory spiritual, cognitive, or ethical goods. Such a self-contained system runs against the philosophical tradition of ta'ame ha- mitzvot in which a mitzvah constitutes a signifier pointing to an external signified that lends it its meaning and authority. This aesthetic theory does not promise material blessings, moral community, the attainment of prophecy, or eternal truths. Rather, it roughly follows the claim found in Pirqe Avot that "one mitzvah leads to another mitzvah, and one sin to another. Because the reward of a mitzvah is a mitzvah, and the wages of sin is sin" (4:2). In other words, the reward of a mitzvah is no less and no more than another mitzvah. Lacking any other direct or concrete sense or purpose, mitzvah is observed for its own sake. As such, mitzvah constitutes a signifier pointing to other signifiers (to other mitzvot) whose cumulative effect may have everything or nothing to do with God, community, or ethics. I readily admit that this moves us far beyond any possible understanding of mitzvah that Soloveitchik himself would have seriously entertained or even recognized. Two sets of potential objections therefore confront the attempt to link this model to him: (1) It may seem that I have turned Soloveitchik into an aesthete. (2) It would also seem that I have ignored the ethical seriousness, the spiritual quality, and the strong sense of commandment that define Soloveitchik's writings in particular and classical Jewish thought writ large. The first possible objection would represent a fundamental misunderstanding of what Kant meant by aesthetics and aesthetic pleasure. To repeat, Kant made a strong distinction between the pleasure people take in "aesthetic" judgments and the sensual gratification they take in objects they find "agreeable." This too must be said: pleasure in Kantian aesthetics (and in Soloveitchik's understanding of halakhah) is an effect, not a motivating reason or cause. Pleasure cannot be a motivating cause in Kant's aesthetic, as that would violate the autonomy of aesthetic judgment. He was quite clear on this point: If the pleasure in the given object came first ... then this procedure would be self-contradictory. For that kind of pleasure would be none other than mere agreeableness of the sensation, so that by its very nature it could have</page><page sequence="20">20 ZACHARY BRAITERMAN only private validity, because it would depend directly on the presentation by which theobject is given.40 In this respect, aesthetic categories make neither Soloveitchik nor Kant a hedonist or an aesthete. Second, we conclude from what follows that Kant's aesthetic does not ignore the supererogatory spiritual and ethical concerns that exercise religious thinkers like Soloveitchik. Nor does it preclude a sense of mitzvah. Mitzvah Jewish philosophers and their students will rightfully note that mitzvah means more than aesthetic pleasure. First and foremost, mitzvot involve a sense of compulsion without which it makes no sense to speak of them as "commandments." However, something similar characterizes Kant's aesthetic. First, judgments about the beautiful are not purely private and subjective; they are communicated to others and assume a rough form of universality. In judging something beautiful, the subject seeks to command universal assent. Even more to the point, aesthetic judgment includes an immanent lawfulness. Kant's argument that aesthetic judgment falls under no determinate purpose does not preclude indeterminate purposiveness. As Kant saw it, people form judgments regarding the beautiful by following an indeterminate concept unique to aesthetic judgment. He called it the notion of "purposiveness without a purpose," noting, We do call objects, states of mind, or acts purposive even if their possibility does not necessarily presuppose the presentation of a purpose; we do this merely because we can explain and grasp them only if we assume that they are based on a causality [that operates] according to purposes, i.e., on a will that would have so arranged them in accordance with the presentation of a certain rule.41 40. Kant, Critique ofJudgment, p. 61. 41. Ibid., p. 65.</page><page sequence="21">JOSEPH SOLOVEITCHIK AND IMMANUEL KANT 21 In other words, we ascribe the general purposiveness of an aesthetic arrangement to a will that arranged it, even if we do not know the precise reasons underlying it. At most we can know that aesthetic judgment has a general, formal purposiveness to it: "namely to keep [us in] the state of [having] the presentation itself, and [to keep] the cognitive powers engaged [in their occupation] without any further aim."42 That is, the purposiveness in judging a presentation beautiful is to maintain that presentation as an object of consciousness, to make it linger for as long as possible. As such, Kant observed something compelling about aesthetic experience; it commands prolonged attention by drawing the observer after it. To apply Kant's notion of "purposiveness without a purpose" to mitzvah would entail the following. The human person may not know the precise reason or purpose, the ta 'am underlying many of the commandments. On the other hand, one ascribes these mitzvot to a will (whose?) that has arranged them according to a general purposiveness of which we can know nothing. Even more to the point: the formal purposiveness of these commandments is (requoting Kant) to keep the observant Jew "in the state of [having] the presentation itself, and [to keep] the cognitive powers engaged [in their occupation]." In this light, the general purposiveness of the commandments keeps those who observe commandments observing commandments once they start observing them. As such, the mitzvot effectively build upon themselves. Observing mitzvot draws those who observe them into observing more. and more mitzvot in greater detail and with greater zeal. Having so commanded the attention of those who follow them, their primary purposiveness has been fulfilled. These acts may or may not then assume the host of supererogatory and idiosyncratic moral and spiritual goods ascribed to them by Jewish thinkers throughout the ages. Moral Purpose A mitzvah system following the strictures of Kant's Third Critique is self- contained. One observes mitzvah on account of mitzvah. This does not mean, 42. Ibid., p. 68.</page><page sequence="22">22 ZACHARY BRAITERMAN however, that a system of ritual acts cannot point beyond itself to supererogatory moral goods. Kant confirmed this aspect of aesthetic judgment by admitting how interest may attach to it once the judgment has been made. He knew that society takes an active ethical interest in the beautiful. He even thought that aesthetic taste might advance society.43 On the one hand, Kant made the obvious point that a feeling for beauty is distinct from morality. On the other hand, he assumed that a "direct interest in the beauty of nature . . . is always a mark of a good soul."44 To apply this to the mitzvot as I think Soloveitchik might have understood them: one first performs and takes delight in the mitzvah for its own sake and then brings it to bear upon ethical interests. To give ethics priority would threaten the autonomy of the halakhic act. However, the argument that the mitzvah system is primarily self-contained does not absolve one from moral responsibilities. These responsibilities are neither primary nor uniquely Jewish. As Soloveitchik argues in The Halakhic Mind, ethics are universally shared and therefore not particular to Judaism or halakhah. To be sure, one might still argue that "the purpose of the mitzvah is to create moral community." But a more precise rendering of this statement might read: "the primary purpose of the mitzvah is to create a moral community that follows mitzvot." Spiritual Purpose To call the system of mitzvah self-contained does not mean that it has no reference to a God who stands (in whatever sense) outside that system. After all, Kant himself saw how forming sublime judgments points the subject to ideas of Reason, to the ideas of God and moral freedom. According to Soloveitchik, cleaving to God does not constitute the purpose of studying halakhah. Yet Soloveitchik also describes the Shekhinah as resting on that very student studying it li-shemah. The distinction made by Kant between motivating cause and supererogatory effect settles the contradiction between studying li-shemah and spiritual reward. One studies li-shemah. The resting 43. Ibid., p. 163. 44. Ibid., p. 165.</page><page sequence="23">JOSEPH SOLOVEITCHIK AND IMMANUEL KANT 23 of the Shekhinah is a supererogatory spiritual effect, what Derrida might have called a "dangerous supplement." Moving past Kant's critique, we see the following two aspects of Soloveitchik's thought that allow theological understandings to jibe with an immanent understanding of halakhic purposiveness. (1) At a very basic level, Soloveitchik does not see God standing outside the system of mitzvah. We noted above that he considered the essence of halakhah to represent an emanation of divine will and wisdom. As such, the finite mitzvah system forms an immanent part of a greater spiritual-intellectual nexus: the mind of God. It therefore makes no sense to speak of the mitzvot pointing "beyond" themselves to God, since they themselves are said by Soloveitchik to constitute a part of that very Godhead. (2) Even if one hesitates before this leap of faith, the following holds true in Soloveitchik's thought. The act of devequt does not constitute an end that is external to the halakhic system. According to Soloveitchik, devequt is itself a mitzvah. As such, the purpose of performing a mitzvah remains intrinsic to the system of performance. Mitzvot point to each other and not to goods external to the system. The primary purpose of a mitzvah (lighting candles) is another mitzvah (cleaving to God).45 Conclusion I do not want to understate the difference between Soloveitchik's understanding of mitzvah and Kant's Third Critique. The latter's notion of an immanent, indeterminate lawfulness does not provide the strongest sense of mitzvah that Soloveitchik himself intends. But then again, the same can be said about Soloveitchik's presentation of halakhah. The rabbis believed that God revealed the written and oral Torah in its entirety to Moses at Sinai. Mendelssohn and Samson Raphael Hirsch tried to bring this tradition into the modern period. Although Soloveitchik believed no less in the Torah's divine origins, he eschews what Rosenzweig called a pseudo-juridical 45. Soloveitchik, "U-viqiashtem mi-sham," pp. 187, 194-95.</page><page sequence="24">24 ZACHARY BRAITERMAN conceptualization of revelation.46 His thought squirms instead on assumptions regarding the divine nature of halakhah and a combination of Aristotelian and neo-Kantian epistemologies (discussed in full by Ravitzky and Kaplan). All this does not mean that Soloveitchik himself does not approach halakhah as a juridical system with determinate contents and concepts. The turn to Kant reflected in this essay represents my own attempt to work through and stretch Soloveitchik's philosophical corpus. Defending this turn, I can only conclude that Kant's aesthetic does not preclude moral purpose, spiritual verve, and a rough sense of mitzvah. Moreover, Soloveitchik's own implicit aesthetic may end up proving more cogent than his own primary theological, epistemological, and ethical assertions. Finally, the Kantian legacy and modem theoretical sciences belonged to a broad cultural nexus that included artists like Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, and Kazimir Malevitch (whose own thoughts about art were infused by spiritual and occult currents). Soloveitchik's turn to Kant and theoretical science brings him into a tighter proximity with abstract art than he himself might have imagined. Theoretical scientists, abstract artists, and this Jewish philosopher shared a common vocabulary of beautiful form, sublime force, and autonomous value. As such, Soloveitchik himself supplied the very basis for this misreading of him--a misreading that generates an aesthetic analysis of mitzvah that respects the limits of reason and a possible defense against Kant's critique of statutory religion.
