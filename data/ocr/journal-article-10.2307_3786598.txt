<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID M. NICHOLAS NEW PATHS OF SOCIAL HISTORY AND OLD PATHS OF HISTORICAL ROMANTICISM An Essay Review on the Work and Thought of Otto Brunner The appearance of a second and expanded edition of Neue Wege der Verfassungs- und Sozialgeschichte by the Austro-German historian Otto Brunner provides opportunity for a comprehensive analysis of his work and its influence. Brunner's work is still scarcely known outside Germany, yet he provides a key to many trends now apparent in historical writing there. The new edition contains eighteen papers: the ten which appeared in the first edition (Neue Wege der Sozialgeschichte [1956]) plus eight articles which appeared in more recent years. The earliest of the papers in the second edition first appeared in 1949, the most recent in 1965. One, "'Feudalismus': Ein Beitrag zur Begriffsgeschichte," appeared in English in Lordship and Community in Medieval Europe, ed. F. L. Cheyette (New York, 1968). Of the eight additional essays only one, "Das Fach 'Geschichte' und die historischen Wissenschaften," adds appreciably to the theoretical statement of Brunner's position. Others are specific instances of his methodology which fill in the broad outlines pre- sented in the earlier articles. Two of the new essays, "' Feudalismus" and "Bemerkungen zu den Begriffen 'Herrschaft' und 'Legitimitat,"' deal with specific problems of historical terminology, a theme which looms large in Brunner's view of history and his methodology. Of the DAVID M. NICHOLAS is in the department of history at the University of Nebraska. Reviewed in this essay is Otto Brunner, Neue Wege der Verfassungs- und Sozial- geschichte, 2d ed. enl. (G6ttingen: Vanderhoeck and Ruprecht, 1968; 345 pp.). The reviewer was introduced to the work of Otto Brunner in 1964 in the seminar of Hans Rosenberg, Shepard Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley. He wishes to thank Professor Rosenberg for his many helpful comments and suggestions.</page><page sequence="2">journal of social history more "historical," as opposed to theoretical, of the new essays, the most important is unquestionably " Souveranitatsproblem und Sozialstruktur in den deutschen Reichsstidten der frUhen Neuzeit," a paper in which terminological considerations also play an important role. There is a certain amount of repetition among the essays, as Brunner admits in his introduction, but this is probably inevitable when one reprints unchanged a collection of papers by the same scholar dealing with different aspects of what is fundamentally the same problem. The addition of the word Verfassung to the title of the second edition has a largely theoretical significance. A major theme which Brunner follows in this collection is the necessity of interrelating various disciplines, for history is neither an all-inclusive unity nor a science (p. 8). He uses Verfassung, as he states in his introduction, to complement Sozial, for the two are interrelated, and the type of historical study which he urges can be termed either Verfassungs- geschichte or Sozialgeschichte according to the particular viewpoint of the historian. He goes further in "Das Problem einer europaischen Sozialgeschichte" and asserts that "it is no longer possible to differentiate between historical sociology and social history; one may use either term, depending upon whether the topic treated is con- sidered under the aspect of history or sociology" (p. 102). He calls for broader viewpoints in the tradition of the Strukturgeschichte concept expressed by Werner Conze in Die Strukturgeschichte des technisch-industriellen Zeitalters als Aufgabe fir Forschung und Unterricht (Cologne, 1957). Brunner means by this concept a general viewpoint which bridges the individual disciplines; certainly he does not seem to have been influenced by the anthropological structur- alists. He calls upon the historian to view the entire picture of the human past, then to describe various entities within it in terms of their interrelationships and their relationships to that past itself. Brunner views the general subject of "social history" as dealing with society in the sense of Gesellschaft, with men in their relation- ships to one another. Sozialgeschichte is actually a narrower concept which has originated only since the period of the French Revolution; yet upon it modern ideas of Gesellschaft were developed ("Das Problem" [pp. 80-82]). Sozialgeschichte in this sense is only one of the modern social sciences, a group of disciplines which, as we shall see, Brunner views with considerable distaste. It deals with the inner structure of human groups, while Brunner uses political history to 278</page><page sequence="3">THE WORK AND THOUGHT OF OTTO BRUNNER designate the discipline which describes how those groups have maintained themselves against external forces. Brunner nonetheless is trying to give a broader connotation to Sozialgeschichte than is normally associated with either it or with Gesellschaft by including under it not merely " social" groups but also political institutions and the intellectual framework within which society as a whole operates. Each of these forms or divisions of history is necessary for genuine Strukturgeschichte, the most comprehensive term except history per se which Brunner uses, but even Strukturgeschichte is only one way of approaching the whole of history. None of the forms of history can claim that it is the only legitimate method of approach. All, in con- trast to the modern social sciences, have human beings as opposed to the works of human beings as their subjects. This is obviously the case with social history; it is less obvious with political history, for political has become bound to a modern conception of politics as the technique of power struggle. Brunner prefers to use the term in the ancient Greek sense of the totality of human life as connected with the state or with governance, although in practice he tends to limit it in the direction of the modern sense of politics. Otto Brunner is thus a practicing historian who, having begun his career in essentially traditional patterns, in later years has begun to think and write about the implications of history, its meaning, and its methodology. The present essays were all written after the appearance of the scholarly monographs for which Brunner is best known. Most of the essays are of interest more for methodology and concepts than for specific "historical" contributions. Hence it seems appropriate to consider Brunner's earlier work. It provides keys to the theoretical positions which he has elaborated during the two decades covered by the essays in Neue Wege. Brunner began his career as a historian of the city of Vienna; he spent most of his scholarly career at the university there, then moved to the University of Hamburg in 1954. His first monograph, Die Finanzen der Stadt Wien von den Anfangen bis ins 16. Jahrhundert (Vienna, 1929), unfortunately is scarcely known outside the German world. In many respects it is a traditional and in every respect a solid treatment of its subject. Yet even at this early stage Brunner sought deeper meaning. His work, more than a mere financial history, expands to include insights into the broader operations of city government and into the social development of the town. Brunner has tended recently, with his work on Hamburg, to return 279</page><page sequence="4">journal of social history to his earlier interest as a town historian. During the middle period of his career, however, he was the historian par excellence of the south German rural aristocracy. This rural orientation has colored, and unfortunately distorted, his more theoretical work to a consider- able degree. Brunner is best known in the West for Land und Herrschaft (first ed.: Vienna, 1939; fifth ed.: Vienna, 1965). This work is one of the landmarks of modern German historiography. It has had a revolution- ary impact on views of later medieval political life and social norms and mores. Critics of the book, myself among them, cannot deny its monumental character even as they criticize it. Land und Herrschaft is an attempt to portray conditions among the nobility in Austria and Bavaria in the later Middle Ages. In it Brunner enunciates several themes which recur constantly in Neue Wege. First he emphasizes the anachronism of applying modern terminological concepts to the history of the period before the eighteenth century, an age which Brunner considers to have witnessed the "breakthrough to the modern world." In Land und Herrschaft Brunner objects particularly to the use of the term state in dis- cussions of the Middle Ages. A state in the modern age is an autono- mous corporation, separated in principle from "society," and characterized chiefly by its being the sole legitimate exerciser of power within the body politic and social. The Middle Ages, Brunner argues, had no concept of the state but only a loose idea of all men being bound to live under justice. "Justice" is viewed as an Aris- totelian concept with every man "having his due" and in particular having his freedom. This "freedom" is positive; it is not only a freedom from certain restrictions but also a freedom, even an obligation, to perform certain actions. Freedom also has the terri- torial concept of Freiung, an area free from outside interference. "Freedom" carries the connotation of privilege, not (in contrast to the ideological corpus derived from the age of the French Revolution) of the freedom of all citizens within the nation. Without a state monopolizing the legitimate exercise of power, every household lord (a concept to which we shall return shortly) has the power of legiti- mate resistance to infringements upon his freedom, that is, offenses against justice. Again, lacking the state as the ultimate arbiter of justice, each household lord decides what is just for him and what he shall resist. Correspondingly society was based not on a concept of the relationship of the subject to the sovereign state but rather of fidelity 280</page><page sequence="5">THE WORK AND THOUGHT OF OTTO BRUNNER involving mutual obligations formalized in private contractual relationships. Fidelity governed relationships among lords and between them and their peasants. Brunner thus provides a theoretical justification for the turbulent condition of late medieval Germany and in particular of the feud, the core of the noble's right of resistance against injustice. He notes that numerous late medieval sources speak of violent nobles as latrones and spoliatores. Yet he also argues that for the modern historian to take these designations at face value is somehow to inject a modern moral judgment about the state and the legitimacy of the exercise of power. The historian should on the contrary view the conduct of the nobles in terms of what they thought of themselves and how they regarded their own actions, for as Brunner repeatedly emphasizes, this was a "noble world," and the ethos of the nobility was the ethos around which all social values of every group were based. Despite Brunner's dissatisfaction with the use of modern terms to describe the phenomena of the past, he never claims that we should use the terminology of the past uncritically in an attempt to portray historical reality. In this case indeed Brunner tells us with which sources we should agree. The contemporary writers who thought that the feud was simple plunder and murder did not know what they were talking about. They lacked historical perspective, the ability to see structures in their totality, and as such failed to appreciate some of "the most sublime accomplishments of medieval rulers and peoples" (Land und Herrschaft, fourth ed. [Vienna, 1959], p. 11). This is not the place for a detailed critique of Land und Herrschaft. One must wonder, however, how the Landesherr was considered to have a place somehow above other nobles with the particular duty of preserving peace (the function which ultimately enabled him to erode the foundations of the "noble world" with the beginnings of the modern state) if the period totally lacked a conception of the state. It seems quite apparent indeed from the earliest barbarian law codes that if the earliest Germanic tribes lacked such a conception, they had borrowed one from the Romans by the time of the composition of the codes. Brunner totally ignores numerous modern studies of the influence of Roman law in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries when the early medieval conception of the state was transformed into something approaching the modern. It seems certain that state in the modern sense was in current usage in England by the early fourteenth century at the latest. While the cases of France and Germany are 281</page><page sequence="6">journal of social history more ambiguous, much of the royalist literature coming out of the quarrel between Philip IV and Boniface VIII and of that between Ludwig of Bavaria and Pope John XXII would seem to anticipate the modern state. Marsiglio of Padua indeed defines the state in terms of a monopoly of coercive power, a concept which Brunner claims (Neue Wege, passim and esp. pp. 66-69, 303) only appears in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Most fundamental to a discussion of Brunner's theoretical views, however, is his tendency in formulating his views of the medieval and modern "states" to set up and tilt at terminological windmills. This tendency becomes quite pronounced in several of the essays in Neue Wege (esp. pp. 113 ff., 137 ff., 213 ff.), although it is decidedly less apparent in others. The concept of the state current in the twentieth century is not that of the nineteenth, let alone that of the fourteenth. To deny that the fourteenth century knew the same idea of public power as that of the present day proves nothing; to say that because of this it knew no conception of public power at all is simply errone- ous. Brunner himself speaks of a "medieval state" in which local authorities were subjects of the king yet were in a relationship of fidelity to him ("Vom Gottesgnadentum zum monarchischen Prinzip" [p. 165]) ; few would deny this idea but it hardly corresponds to Brunner's thoughts in even more recent editions of Land und Herrschaft. Brunner also admits that such terms as institutioneller Fldchenstaat and Lehnstaat are useful if the historian is fully aware that he is not describing a state in the modern sense ("Die Freiheitsrechte in der altstandischen Gesellschaft" [pp. 188 ff.]) Since Brunner feels that the proper object of concern of the social historian is the human being rather than his works, he bases his discussion of the southwest German Ldnder in Land und Herrschaft on the idea that the Land was composed not of territory but rather of the Landesherr and the Landesgemeinde living under a common Landrecht. Landesgemeinde is defined as the lords who exercised an independent household authority under the Landesherr. The only subject of concern for the historian of Herrschaft, or rule, in "old Europe" is hence the nobility. The nobility is essentially a countryside class. In the Middle Ages the townsmen, in Brunner's view, simply imitated noble manners. The Middle Ages, then, was a "noble world," the world particularly of the lesser nobles of the ritterlich-hofische Kultur. This ethic was formulated principally by the great poets of the late twelfth and early 282</page><page sequence="7">THE WORK AND THOUGHT OF OTTO BRUNNER thirteenth centuries, most of whom had ministerial or even bourgeois origins ("Das Wiener Biirgertum in Jans Enikels FUrstenbuch" [pp. 263-64]). It was only with the development of "modern industrial civilization," a catchphrase that Brunner uses with causative force for a multitude of ills, that the bourgeoisie developed its own ethic, an occurrence which helped lead to the overthrow of the "noble world." And this same modern development led to a breakdown of the old patriarchal unities in both town and countryside, unities so character- istic of the world of the noble. Primary among these unities was the Haus, the extended household. The Haus is a subject of frequent treatment by Brunner in Land und Herrschaft, in Adeliges Landleben und europiischer Geist (Salzburg, 1949), and in Neue Wege, particularly in the article " Das'ganze Haus' und die alteuropaische 'Okonomik."' It included governmental functions which in the modern period appertain solely to the state: the authority exercised by the household lord not only over his "family" in the more narrow modern sense but over his familia, his dependent peasants and their families, his household servants, and all who came under his protection. Combined with this was the ancient conception of oeconomia, a broad idea of agrarian household and estate manage- ment based upon the self-sufficiency of the individual unit. Oeconomia sharply contrasts with the more purely materialistic ethic of moder "economics," which is based on the marketplace and gain. Oeconomia differs from modern capitalism in this respect and also in its less "rational" or planned character. The basic function of the house- hold was thus less "economic" in the modern sense than "political" in the classical sense, for it was the basic governmental unit of the late Middle Ages and the early modern period, the area over which the Hausherr exercised his Vogtei, his Herrschaft over his familia. The household lords then constituted the petty nobility or landholding class. They were the Landesgemeinde, those with "political" rights in the classical sense. Brunner argues that modern economic historians have completely misunderstood ancient and medieval "economic history," for moder Wirtschaft is not the same as oeconomia. Yet it seems to me that most modern economic historians of the Middle Ages have fully recognized the governmental functions of the lord of the household and how very different the nature of the household was then from now. They are simply trying to portray a particular set of relation- ships within the household in terms which will be intelligible to men 4 283</page><page sequence="8">journal of social history of the present. The issue here, as in the case of the "state," is or should be how the affairs of the household were carried on, not what they are called. Brunner admits that this is the case, but solely because the oeconomia of old Europe can be understood only through the methods of modern economic history ("Das 'ganze Haus"' [p. 122]). Yet, he continues, before his work modern economic historians did not understand that they were portraying only a partial function of the "entire household "-an estimate of Brunner's importance with which I must differ. It is obvious that Brunner's conception of the later Middle Ages can easily lead to unhistorical romanticizing about a lost bucolic paradise where the lords were well-read, conscious of their virtue, gentle rulers of their peasants, etc.-at least while they were not defending iusticia through the feud. The romanticism which is implicit in Land und Herrschaft becomes explicit in Adeliges Land- leben. Here Brunner tries to trace the conceptions of the nobility and the household through a study of the lesser Austrian nobility in the seventeenth century, particularly through Wolf Helmhard von Hohberg (1612-88), a minor baroque epic poet who also wrote on noble estate management and-perhaps characteristically-sold his rural estates and spent the last quarter century of his life in Regens- burg. Most of Brunner's work in this book, however, deals less with von Hohberg than with an elaborate development of the idea of nobility which derives ultimately from the Greeks. The Greek con- cept of arete ("virtue") characterizes the noble. He is "privileged" (only in the distorted modern conception) because his innate virtue, of which he is well aware, causes him to stand out above his fellow men. Christian ideas enter the picture in the early Middle Ages, a period which forms a noteworthy gap in Brunner's presentation. From the time of the investiture contest, however, Church and secular world begin to separate, and with this increasing dichotomy much of the spiritual and intellectual justification of the nobility was threatened. It nonetheless continued to be the dominant ethic of society between the twelfth and eighteenth centuries, a development which "can only be understood through the continuity of a particular social structure" (" Osterreichische Adelsbibliotheken des 15. bis. 18. Jahrhunderts als geistesgeschichtliche Quelle" [p. 288]). The intel- lectual formulation given to the noble ethic by the great poets of the High Middle Ages remained definitive. 284</page><page sequence="9">THE WORK AND THOUGHT OF OTTO BRUNNER This picture is grotesquely ahistorical. Brunner ignores numerous modern treatments which have shown that nobility in the Middle Ages was considered to be transmitted by blood rather than by virtue. Brunner correctly notes that some degree of "political" authority was necessary for one to be considered noble. This political authority, as Brunner well knows, was acquired in the early Middle Ages by the most crass forms of usurpation and in the later period by means only slightly more refined. Yet Brunner bewails the modern conception of politics as power struggle as something differentiating the modern age from the good old times. He is not unaware further- more of social mobility upward into the noble classes ("Biirgertum und Adel in Nieder- und Ober6sterreich" [pp. 271 ff.]), yet he does not seem aware of the enormous gap between the lesser nobility, upon whose activities he concentrates in Land und Herrschaft and Adeliges Landleben, and the greater nobles. Brunner notes the wide range of works, particularly classical, but also from the Middle Ages and the Reformation, including devotional literature, in Austrian noble libraries ("Osterreichische Adelsbibliotheken" [pp. 284 ff.]). He admits that most of the nobles whom he is describing were illiterate. Yet at other points he argues that those who accuse them of acquiring books merely out of fashion fail to understand their ethos. He sees a common intellectual world among the nobility in the seventeenth century, both Protestant and Catholic, based on the classics, the Christian tradition (which was basically the same for both confessions), and the universities. In Neue Wege Brunner urges historians to view the total picture. Yet in his own historical work he concentrates almost exclusively on the noble classes and those who imitated them (e.g., the town patricians, the "urban nobility"), feeling that in so doing he is portraying the basic ethic motivating the entire period between the twelfth and eighteenth centuries; he insists furthermore on viewing them as they saw themselves or pretended to see themselves, without benefit of either historical perspective or an indication of what those outside the noble world thought of their behavior. But this "noble world" ended with the development of modem science and scientific methodology and with the industrial revolution. The progression culminated in the French Revolution. As Brunner correctly emphasizes, these changes have drastically altered our way of life, ethical and moral standards, and terminology. The implication of these changes for the practicing historian, and in particular for 285</page><page sequence="10">journal of social history the historian who tries to deal with the problems of "old Europe," is the object of concern of most of the studies in Neue Wege. Perhaps primary among these problems in Brunner's view is the fact that the modern age has seen a fragmentation of history into numerous Fachwissenschaften ("branches" of history), related disciplines, and auxiliary sciences. Brunner has in mind particularly the social sciences, whose influence upon historians he deplores, yet with which he urges contact and cooperation. The new disciplines are not primarily historical. They are based upon and have as their primary concern either man's works or (as with such disciplines as sociology and psychology) man himself without reference to his past. The proper concern of the historian, in contrast, is man himself in his past structural situation. For example, the legal historian is concerned chiefly with law rather than with the past per se; the social historian in Brunner's conception is concerned with the past and will deal with laws and legal systems of the past only as part of the overall picture that he is trying to give concerning the men of the period with which he is dealing. Brunner admits the truth of Croce's formulation that all history is ultimately present; yet if the historian looks at history only with the hope of explaining the present or some aspect of the present, he loses his appreciation not only of past ages in terms of themselves but also of the totality of the historical development of past ages. Although Brunner obviously regrets the modern fragmenta- tion which prevents a unitary view, he does not deplore specialization per se. He admits that the successful historian must be a specialist, but one with a broad viewpoint who has mastered the methods both of his own and of related disciplines (" Das Fach 'Geschichte"' [p. 23]). Brunner admits that the social sciences are useful. Yet they are bound to the world of "contingent being," in the language of the scholastics, and since Descartes this world has become inextricably bound to philosophy, almost to the exclusion of the world of absolute being. Philosophy claims universal validity, with the result that under the influence of the social sciences a philosophy of "history" has arisen emphasizing the allegedly universal validity of one aspect of man's development as a basis for other developments. The philosophy of history portrays past ages not in terms of themselves but in terms of the end result of the historical process whether in the present day or in the future. Brunner treats this problem and its origins particularly cogently in "Abendlandisches Geschichtsdenken" (pp. 26-44). 286</page><page sequence="11">THE WORK AND THOUGHT OF OTTO BRUNNER In a sense this development is a secularization and particularization of the philosophy of history developed by the radical strain of medieval thinkers under the influence of Greek anthropomorphic conceptions of state and society, conceptions which included an idea of development within the process. The early Christian philosophy of history, under the dominant influence of St. Augustine, saw the historical process purely in terms of the human spirit on its road to salvation. But in the High Middle Ages the idea spread of a chosen people, such as the Romans under imperial auspices, and with it an emphasis on the role of various groups within the history of the world. Such concepts apparently began in the second century and received their first clear formulation in the work of Eusebius of Caesarea. This tradition is first clearly united with the Augustinian ideas which had dominated the early Middle Ages in the work of Otto of Freising in the twelfth century. This more secular strain in Christian eschatology in turn dominates the Augustinian tradition beginning with the thirteenth century when both the Church and the secular power developed distinctly radical ideologies while also maintaining the more traditional patterns of thought. With the separation of philosophy and theology, furthermore, both a secular and a religious strain developed within the Church itself. The modern historicists are thus in the radical Christian tradition of Joachim of Flora, a tradition which has become secularized in the modern period by the substitution in philosophy, which was origin- ally religiously oriented, of reason as a means of obtaining salvation rather than faith and/or divine providence ("Das 'ganze Haus"' [p. 126], "Abendlandisches Geschichtsdenken" [p. 40], "Das Zeitalter der Ideologien: Anfang und Ende" [p. 59]). As this organic developmental thought came to fruition in the eighteenth century, modern historicism emerged. The tragedy of the modern develop- ment of the philosophy of history, in Brunner's view, is that every attempt to take an overall view of the historical process which has been made to date has been made by the social sciences and always under the aegis of some form of determinism. The social scientists see history as proceeding in orderly "developments," in artistic styles following one another, in "schools" of philosophy, in "stages" of economic growth, and the like ("Das Fach 'Geschichte"' [p. 22]). They received most of their terminology and methodology in the struggle between theory and "reality" in the "age of ideologies." Brunner argues that while such ideas as "development" and "stage" 287</page><page sequence="12">journal of social history are useful tools for understanding the past, they have no inherent reality in themselves. They are merely imposed by the historian or social scientist upon his material as a construction. Yet, he continues, the social scientists normally assume that these ideas have historical reality in themselves. The historian thus cannot simply compile the conclusions of the social scientists concerning the period with which he is dealing. He must know their methodology and be able to rework their material in a light more appropriate to an historical study. Hence Brunner constantly battles the tendency of the presentation of history to be affected in the modern period by the separation of state and society, the introduction of scientific methodology into history, and of a residual eschatology having its roots in Christianity. History when viewed under these aspects is seen as an impersonal or supernatural process operating under fixed laws. Brunner, in con- trast, sees each event in history as a unique occurrence, although our understanding of this uniqueness should be furthered by a comparison of similar events and structures. Hence Brunner spends much time in Neue Wege inveighing against various determinist positions and their effects, particularly in the essay " Das Zeitalter der Ideologien." He uses ideology to mean a specific historical pheno- menon, the group of theories which originated out of the strife of the French Revolution and the years immediately following, in particular the various forms of liberalism, conservatism, and socialism and the nationalisms which have come to be connected with them. The ideologies have as common forces uniting them a unique and utopian belief in history as a process and the fact that they are based or claim to be based on modern science and its methodology. The ideologies of the modern age unite two separate conceptions: the idea in the Greek sense of form and a moral conception of what ought to be. The ideologies thus concern themselves with the "good" society, now seen apart from the state, and thus contribute still further to the separation of the two. They normally involve a political program, and the tension between ideology-the realm of pure idea-and political "reality" is always an important part of their development. Brunner sees the importance of the future in history as a significant feature of the "age of ideologies." He notes that "ideologies" in his sense of the term are weakening in the West, but in areas in which the industrial revolution is only now coming they provide the same substitute for religion and earlier intellectual attitudes that they did in 288</page><page sequence="13">THE WORK AND THOUGHT OF OTTO BRUNNER Europe during the eighteenth century ("Das Zeitalter der Ideo- logien" [pp. 61 ff.]). It should be noted in connection with Brunner's judgment of historical determinism and of the role of the idea in history that he often seems to fall victim to the very determinism against which he warns. He bases his idea of the unity of the twelfth through eighteenth centuries upon essentially ideological criteria: the separation of Church and world in the late eleventh century and the elaboration of a noble ethic, then the rise of modem science, the end of the noble ethic, and the development of separate ethics for other social groups at the end of this period. The world of "old Europe" terminated in the "age of ideologies," that of the French Revolution which created the modern concepts of nation, people, state, and the like ("'Feudal- ismus"' [pp. 129 ff.]). Within this period, Brunner seems to feel that whatever the "realities" (in the modern sense) of the situation may have been, the conduct of the noble-and after him of other social groups in considerably varying degree-was determined by abstract conceptions of nobility and virtue. In "Vom Gottes- gnadentum" Brunner claims that the European monarchy lost its function because it lost its unique status of rule by the grace of God and became subject to ideas of natural law which juxtaposed the state with civil society and made the former subject to the latter. Whether Brunner is correct in his determinism is a matter for the individual "ideologue" to decide; of importance here is the central fact that Brunner does not seem to realize that his work shows him in considerable measure subject to the same criticism that he directs at others. Brunner is obviously very preoccupied with the antecedents of the break of the eighteenth century: the gap between noble ideal and noble reality, the changes within the noble world, and the beginning of more "modern" modes of thought under the influence of science. In view of this, one must wonder why he considers the eighteenth century break so fundamental or why he is so precise as to the time that the break occurred. One strongly suspects that the men of the seventeenth century had as much difficulty thinking of the fifteenth century in terms of itself, apart from the linguistic tools with which they had to work-those of their own day-as did the men of the nineteenth century in trying to recapture the seventeenth. Brunner's historical periodization is interesting and ingeniously constructed, but it is entirely too rigid in its separation of old and new. 289</page><page sequence="14">journal of social history Basic to Brunner's position is his conception of historical termin- ology and the necessity for the historian to use terms which are rele- vant to men of the present and yet at the same time avoid anachronism in dealing with the past, in particular the period before the eighteenth century. Much of the terminology now used by historians was developed in the "age of ideologies," itself a product of the "break- through to the modern world," and was borrowed by historians directly from the various social sciences. As a result of the chronol- ogy of the "breakthrough," however, the social structure of Europe immediately before the French Revolution became the basis upon which much of the historian's terminology was evolved. With the new mores which developed under the aegis of modern industrial society, as opposed to the "noble world," two tendencies become apparent: first, unfavorable value judgments about a past which could no longer be understood were incorporated into the language; second, conditions of the early eighteenth century became the basis upon which critiques and descriptions of medieval society were made, for example in connection with the use of the word feudalism ("'Feudalismus"' [p. 134]). In four of the articles in Neue Wege Brunner discusses the historical foundations of the terms rule (Herrschaft), legitimacy, feudalism, and Stinde (a word which even in its modern connotation is difficult to translate into English). He shows in particular the linguistic origin of these terms, the historical circumstances of their beginning, and what they have meant to different persons at different times. Brunner seems at times to despair that the historian can ever overcome the "breakthrough to the modern world" and formulate a historical terminology adequate for the expression of the realities of the lost past. Certainly few would deny the basic logic of his position that the historian of the present must distort the past because he has experi- enced only his own present. Yet Brunner also feels that the historian must continue to try to bridge this gap or risk complete intellectual isolation in his present. Much of the work on historical terminology which has been done in Germany during the past generation is at least partly under the influence of Brunner's terminological discussions in Land und Herrschaft. Much of it, for example the work of Walter Schlesinger and Karl Bosl, has been more fruitful than that of Brunner himself, who seems to feel that if the past cannot be re- captured it must be romanticized, particularly in view of the " spiritual crisis of the present day" (Adeliges Landleben [p. 339]). Historians 290</page><page sequence="15">THE WORK AND THOUGHT OF OTTO BRUNNER are now tending to concentrate less on such catchwords as state and feudalism and to speak more in terms of ruling relationships and the like. Brunner does not call for an automatic broadening of concepts, for this may deprive useful terms of their meaning; rather he has urged the use of terms that reflect with the greatest possible accuracy the totality of the social structures of a particular segment of the past ("'Feudalismus'" [p. 159]). Neue Wege also contains expressions of Brunner's belief that there are certain social forms and structures peculiar to Europe, with Europe being defined as western Christendom rather than a geographical concept. He treats these features particularly in the fundamental article "Das Problem" and in "Europaisches Bauern- tum," "Stadt und Biirgertum in der europaischen Geschichte," and "Europaisches und russisches Biirgertum." Since the nation as a concept has only arisen since the eighteenth century, he urges his- torians to avoid becoming bogged down in national history, al- though nations must be considered as part of the total social history of a people. Brunner basically accepts Max Weber's concept of a "trend to- ward rationality" as a feature of European history which distin- guishes it from others. Brunner does not adopt this category in the sense of rationality in general but rather points to specific instances of what he considers rational in European development: the limitation of the "divine" functions of Western rulers by legal and super- natural sanctions; the view that law is above the state, with the concomitant separation of Church and secular authority in the West, a development which has deprived the secular power of some of the supernatural justification that it has had in non-European civilizations. As one might expect, Brunner also sees the altstandische Gesellschaft, in which every Hausherr had the right and duty to resist tyranny, as an instance of the peculiarly European rationality before it was whittled away by the bureaucracy of the modern state. Brunner also sees the great medieval seigneuries as an example of the rationality of "old Europe" ("Europaisches Bauerntum" [pp. 209 ff.]). He attributes many of the technological advances in Western agriculture during the Middle Ages to this system, claiming that peasants, who always lag behind other elements of the popula- tion in accepting innovation, would never have developed the horse collar, the three-field system, manuring and fertilizing, and the like. Brunner also attributes the great colonization movements of the 291</page><page sequence="16">journal of social history Middle Ages to the rationality of the seigneuries and their lords who could and would want to undertake such enterprises. His generalizations about peasant mentality are overdrawn. In addition recent research, much of it German, has shown the great extent to which individuals and towns were active in leading the colonizing and clearance movements; indeed the great landlords often lagged behind in showing interest, although when they did begin to participate they played an exceedingly important role. Brunner also attributes the considerable independence of European towns and merchants from outside control in the Middle Ages, with the concomitant development of numerous small towns as well as large, to the inherent rationality of a system of numerous small territorial powers, none of which, he implies, could adequately have coerced the towns ("Stadt und Biirgertum" [p. 222]). Brunner rejects the traditional interpretation of the towns as being outside the western European feudal structure, eventually conquering it, and becoming the "nation" in the eighteenth century, because European Feudalismus in contrast to other feudalisms had a place for the towns. The Stadtgemeinden were one form of many types of independent local authority, all of which were ended in 1789 in France and in the nineteenth century in Germany. This line of thought, it should perhaps be noted, is a conspicuous instance of one of Brunner's terminological "windmills." While to the best of my knowledge most scholars still place the medieval town outside Lehnswesen, most would allow it some place within Feudalismus. Despite the immense variation in structures throughout Europe, therefore, Brunner believes that these basic features separate Europe from the outside world and make it an intellectual and structural unit. Europe has known in addition the presence of a comparatively free peasantry; a common tradition of the altstindische Gesellschaft and the end of this society under essentially the same forces throughout Europe; a peculiarly European type of state structure, absolute in the sense of the monopoly of legitimate power, separated from ecclesiastical sanction, yet limited by its position under an abstract law; and finally a distinctive bourgeoisie which he con- siders more active both "economically" (in the modern sense) and politically than the town populations found in non-European cultures. Brunner arrives at his conclusions concerning peculiarly European institutions and social forms by a comparative method, for example 292</page><page sequence="17">THE WORK AND THOUGHT OF OTTO BRUNNER in his comparisons between the bourgeoisie and peasantry of western Europe as a whole and those of Russia. His results are not entirely successful, and he himself admits in his introduction that he deals with non-European phenomena only for purposes of com- parison. He is obviously unfamiliar with Europe outside Germany, and his generalizations about non-Western cultures are derived entirely from the work of other scholars. Brunner notes this difficulty in "Das Fach 'Geschichte"' when he states that the modern historian must broaden his viewpoint to include the non-European yet in so doing will probably lose the mastery of his craft (p. 14). Many of Brunner's generalizations even for European urban and agrarian life are thus suspect to the student of medieval or early modern French or English history. The only study in this volume in which he does an infra-European comparison on a broad scale, "Hamburg und Wien: Versuch eines sozialgeschichtlichen Ver- gleichs," is shallow and contributes very little to an understanding of either city. Brunner's emphasis on the distinct place of Europe in the history of the world is part of his attempt to show that each phenomenon within history is unique and will never be repeated. His comparisons of European structures with those of other civilizations are thus under- taken more with the intention of showing European peculiarities than with the extent to which common features recur. Yet the same thing might be said concerning the uniqueness of each and every political, religious, economic, or social subdivision within Europe. Brunner is trying to prove by speaking in broad terms an idea of history which, while certainly correct, makes suspect each attempt to speak in such broad terms. For as knowledge increases so does the historian's awareness of complexity, and Brunner admits that breadth of vision alone does not make a good historian. Otto Brunner's "new paths" are thus rather newer for German historical scholarship than for that of the West. He is quite correct that German historians, and many in the West as well, have spent too much ink recounting battles, leaders, and insignificant details. He deplores the approach which takes the modern age, or what one would like the modern age to be, as a standard for making moral judgments upon the past. He objects to elaborate argumentation over catchwords. He seeks general lines of development which bridge national and regional boundaries and also individual disciplines, and which, although they have no inherent reality within history for 293</page><page sequence="18">294 journal of social history Brunner, are useful tools of understanding for the historian of the present. Unfortunately Brunner carries his plea beyond this. He posits breaks within the historical process which a more judicious applica- tion of his own methodology does not support. In attempting to justify the conduct of a particular social group, he has elevated European nobility into a principle of such significance that it becomes a characteristic separating European society from others. In his dislike for the modern age and his feeling that the man of the modern age cannot adequately appreciate the past, he has romanti- cized the past with an entirely one-sided approach. Brunner's principles are thus essentially sound, but his own application of them often is not. The strengths and weaknesses of his career as a historian are well summarized in the second edition of Neue Wege.</page></plain_text>
