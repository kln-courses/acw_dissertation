<plain_text><page sequence="1">The American Biology Teacher Vol. 2 APRIL, 1940 No. 7 Living versus Dead Biology1 EDWIN G. CONKLIN Emeritus Professor of Biology, Princeton University Biology is generally defined as the sci- ence of life, or the science that deals with living things, but as it is frequently taught it might better be defined as the science of life with the life left out- necrology rather than biology. I. The detailed study of the anatomy of dead animals lingers in my memory, as their smell lingers in my nostrils, when I think of my first laboratory course in biology. A classicist visiting that laboratory said, "Dead animals sinell worse than the dead languages." Anatomy oceupied a leading part in zoology courses, and I think the same was true of botanical ones, until near the beginning of the present century. It is said that Louis Agassiz, who was the teacher of many of the teachers of biology in America, used to assign to beginning students a preserved specimen of a fish with instructions to make a care- ful study of it, and when they reported to him in a short time he would send them back to do it more thoroughly and often kept them at it for several weeks. When I joined the faculty of the School of Biology at the University of Pennsyl- vania the beginning course in zoology was known as "the cat course," in which students were given a preserved cat and were expected to work out its anatomy after the manner of Agassiz. Only the most persistent students survived. We soon organized an introductory course in general biology, although the botanists insisted on its being called general zoology since they defined biology as "botany taught by a zoologist. " We also had built for our zoological work a vivarium which was the counterpart of the botanist 's greenhouse, and which was, I believe, the first such vivarium in America. It provided for keeping living representatives of all phyla and classes of the animal kingdom, for purposes of teaching and research. Anatomy is only a part, and in general, the least inter- esting part of biology for beginners. Of course it is necessary in any compre- hensive course, but it should not occupy the chief place in an elementary course. 1 Address before The National Association of Biology Teachers, Columbus, Ohio, December 29, 1939.</page><page sequence="2">166 The American Biology Teacher [Apr. II. A great advance was made when the beginning course in biology included physiology as well as morphology. But here also there was too little study of real life as contrasted with mere mecha- nisms, such as muscle-nerve preparations, and the chemistry of digestion, respira- tion and excretion. Such physiology of organs and parts, like their morphology, is a necessary study for advanced stu- dents, but is less suitable for beginners. Scientific research does consist in "know- ing more and more of less and less," in more complete analyses of the structure and function of systems, organs, tissues and cells, but it is important to begin such research only after having acquired a knowledge of whole organisms. It is said that an investigator at Woods Hole who had for two years studied the blood of Linuldus, which was always brought to him in glass vessels, chanced to see for the first time a living Limulus in a tank and said, "For heaven's sake, what is that animal ?" III. Ecology, or old fashioned Nat- ural History, is, in my opinion, the most interesting and important entrance into the science of life. Instead of everlast- ing analysis, seeing more and more of less and less, and consequently getting only fragmentary views of life, it deals with living, moving, feeling animals, with the organization (structure and func- tion) of whole organisms, with their actual development, their food and man- ner of getting it, their enemies, friends and parasites, their mating, breeding and care of young, their daily and seasonal activities, their adaptations to new con- ditions, their behavior, instincts, habits. This is the study of real life, and it is the most fascinating and in recent times the most neglected aspect of biology. Life is change, activity, movement. Animals as well as humans are interested in things that move, because they seem alive. The hawk sees the moving mouse, the mouse the moving cat. The charm of the cinema is that the pictures move and seem alive. The interest of children in living things is largely in what they do, and one of the chief charmns of biology is in the activity of animals and plants. IV. The laboratory study of living things is much more difficult than that of fixed and well preserved material, which can be kept in cans from year to year and can be studied with notes or directions that never need to be changed. The lazy or indifferent teacher will have little use for a course which requires constant care of living material and keen attention to its infinite variety. BuLt it is worth all that it costs. Of course in lim- ited laboratory space small organisms must be used. But the teacher has a great variety of these to choose from- protophyta and protozoa, algae, fungi, mosses and ferns; seeds, seedlings and potted plants; hydroids, worms and rotifers; phyllopods, copepods, decapods, snails; insects, fish and frogs, their eggs and embryos; tadpoles and embryo ehicks. A vast variety of living mate- rial can be studied even in a city school, and in a great many ways, such as their anatoiny, physiology, embryology, adap- tations, regeneration and behavior. Such a study of livino organismns is much more interesting and valuable than the stuLdy of their dead remains. Solomon said, "Better is a live dog than a dead lion," and a wise teacher of biology would say, "Better is a live paramecium than a dead dog." V. Interest in biology is directly pro- portional to its humanization. Modern exact science has been so fearful of anthropomorphism, or the interpretation of animal behavior in terms of human behavior, that it has devitalized biology.</page><page sequence="3">1940] Living versus Dead Biology 167 But to deny that animal behavior is akin to human behavior is to deny the funda- mental postulates of evolution, and to regard animals as mere mechanisms is to affirm that man also is a mere mechanism; to deny feelings of satisfaction or dis- satisfaction to lower animals makes it hard to explain their behavior and equally difficult to explain the behavior of higher animals and man. Differential sensitivity and reactivity are present in all living things, they are the psychic elements in germ cells and embryos out of which develop the psychic phenomena of man, and there is good ground for assuming that some of this psychic development occurs in many ani- mals other than man. The fear of anthropomorphism has gone to such un- reasonable lengths that many analytical biologists deny that man is a self-con- scious personality. Mind, consciousness, emotions, purposes are said to be de- lusions. But delusions of what, if not of these same phenomena; they can scarcely be delusions of delusions. I give it as my deliberate opinion that there is no more danger in interpreting animal be- havior in terms of human behavior than in the reverse process; no more danger of error due to anthropomorphism in the study of amoeba than of amoeba-mor- phism in the study of man. When a sophisticated student once told Professor W. K. Brooks, of Johns Hopkins, that he treated his dog as if he were human, he replied, "If he feels more or less as I do it would be eruel to treat him otherwise, and if he does not have such-feelings it will do no harm to treat him as if he did. " But of course it is possible to misinter- pret both animal and human behavior. We all know that a dog fight is akin to a boy fight, but boys may misinterpret a crowd of paramecia or of ball fans as a fight when it is not. I once gave a lecture at a boy's reformatory on "Living things in a drop of water" and I projected on the screen a colony of living paramecia, and as these little animals swarmed in and out among one another, the boys rose up and shouted, "See 'em fight, See 'em fight." That was an anthropomorphic, or rather a pueromorphic misinterpreta- tion, but not so great as it would have been to have interpreted a crowd of boys or paramecia as a swarm of dead, insen- sitive masses of matter, or a "fortuitous concourse of atoms.'" A humanized biology regards all liv- ing things as fellow creatures. This is the great lesson of evolution. There is no other science that cultivates such a feel- ing of sympathy and fellowship with its objects of study. In this it resembles emotional disciplines such as poetry. The biologist can say with Coleridge: "He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small." Anid certainly the recognition of our fel- lowship with other living creatures de- flates onr egotism and broadens our sympathies. VI. If there were time for it I should like to speak oni " Living versus Dead Teachers," for it is perfectly evident to all of us that both kinds exist. Perhaps we are all only partly alive, both as organisms and as teachers, and can there- fore say with Mrs. Browning, "All our life is mixed with death." But at least some teachers are more alive than others. All good teaching is done in the spirit of discovery; the teacher and the stu- dent should be learners together. Of course, the teacher should be able to keep a little ahead of his students, but not so far ahead that he loses the learner 's point of view. I hold that the first duty of a teacher is not lecturing or the exhibition of erudition, but the furnishing of stimulus</page><page sequence="4">168 The American Biology Teacher [Apr. to the student; the second duty is to lead by example, and the third and least is to impart knowledge. Inspiration, illumination, information are important in the order named. For the chief aim of all teaching should be character f or- mation and the first aim of biology teach- ers should be to cultivate in students habits of (1) open eyes and open minds, (2) sincerity and love of truth, (3) sym- pathy with and appreciation of all that live. These habits are essential to peace and progress, and the cultivation of such habits is the chief hope of the future. In the cultivation of these habits few, if any, subjects are more important than humanized biology, and our profession is a high and holy calling.</page></plain_text>
