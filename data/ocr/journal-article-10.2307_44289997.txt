McKinney2 Abstract This paper develops a theoretical integration and estimates an associated structural equation model of the ecological footprints of nations. The ecological footprint is an approximation of environmental pressure on natural resources that stems from production, consumption, and the resultant disposal of waste. We use structural equation modeling techniques to test an integrative perspective based on direct and indirect effects, taken from human ecology, ecological economics, modernization, and political economy approaches, as well as from the natural sciences. We find evidence for the conjuncture of many of the theories investigated and for contextualizing the footprint in a global network of causes. The model raises questions about conclusions reached in prior analyses based on direct effects only. The significant roles played by natural and economic forces suggest a need to attend to multidisciplinary dynamics. With the exception of "weak sustainability," the indirect and direct impacts suggest ever-escalating levels of the footprints of nations. Keywords ecological footprint, structural equation model, cross-national, environment, sustainability Introduction First articulated by Rees (1992) as "appropriated carrying capacity," the "ecological footprint" compares the demand of the human population on nature with the ability of the biosphere to renew its resources and absorb waste. It is the biologically productive land and sea together with solar forces that regenerate what humans consume and mitigate the harm caused by that con- sumption. With further conceptual and empirical development by Wackernagel and Rees (1996) and others (Bagliani, Bravo, and Dalmazzone 2008; Jorgenson and Clark 2009; York, Rosa, and Dietz 2003a), the "footprint" has become a standard metric to judge humanity's demand on nature and the necessary land requirements for the biosphere to keep pace with our consumption and the waste that flows from that consumption. While the footprint's importance has long been recognized in the expansive body of literature devoted to it, this literature is essentially void of 'North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA 2Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA Corresponding Author: Edward L.

Most cross-national studies focus on the ability of our ecosystems to attempt to meet con- sumption demands via production processes and waste absorption (see, for example, Jorgenson and Clark 2009; York et al. 2003a). By these standards, humanity has been in substantial "over- shoot" of its carrying capacity for at least four decades. Thus, in the absence of appropriate changes, we may literally burn out Earth's foundational natural capital and become unsustainable as a species, alongside our co-species. Population size and growth are the chief threats to sustainability generally and the ecological footprint specifically. Indeed in their pioneering, cross-national quantitative treatment, York et al. (2003a) show what amounts to a near empirical identity between national population and the size of the national footprint. Yet, it is the key substantive interest in national productive, con- sumptive, and waste-disposal activities that determine the ecological footprint and drive this effort. Thus, we ask, barring substantial checks on population, what are the other potent, caus- ative, and ameliorative forces? We examine this issue in the present study of the per capita ecological footprints for most of the nations in the world.1 We emphasize the human ecological and global political-economic interpretations of the envi- ronment in general and their approaches to the footprint in particular (Commoner 1971; T. Dietz and Rosa 1994; Duncan 1961; Jorgenson and Clark 2009; Schnaiberg 1980; York et al. 2003a). However, in contrast to other studies, we develop the argument proposed by some environmental economists that the "weak sustainability" encompassed in "capitals" other than natural capital (e.g., financial capital) in principle can check the pernicious growth in the footprint.2 We treat weak sustainability in the contemporary context of what many have called the era of "the Washington Consensus"3 (Krugman 1995; Stiglitz 2007; Williamson 1990), which commonly is ignored in empirical treatments (see, for example, Özler and Obach 2009) but may prove to be a significant predictor in the model presented. These themes are represented in a diagram of direct and indirect causal forces (Figure 1), all emanating from the ultimate anthropogenic agent of causation, the organization or structure of the modern world system. Theoretical Approaches to Environmental Impact Human Ecology : POET , IPAT, and STIRPAT Human ecology approaches in general can be traced to the classical writing of Malthus ([1803] 1992), who argued that population pressure would ultimately produce "population checks" in the forms of famine and war. Malthus asserted that population checks were necessary because a geo- metrically growing human population would inevitably outpace an arithmetically growing food supply. Neo-Malthusians such as Ehrlich (1968) continue to maintain that we should be centrally concerned with the indirect links between overshooting the planet's carrying capacity, the over- exploitation of its natural resources, and the productive processes that make that overexploitation possible. Beginning with the work of Park and Burgess (1921), and continuing with Hawley (1950), Duncan (1959, 1961), and Schnore (1965), human ecology is a foundational theoretical perspec- tive, which identifies interdependencies among population (P), social organization (O), and tech- nology (T), while maintaining that all three are key causes of environmental problems (E), as well as bring consequences of one another and of the environment itself. POET's holistic approach provides a useful framework for examining the direct and indirect ties that integrate societal-environmental interactions. The introduction of the "O" term for organization is particu- larly important in any effort to understand environmental dynamics.

A newer human ecology approach to environmental impact began with the environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s, led by individuals trained in the natural and biological sci- ences (Carson 1962; Commoner 1971; Ehrlich 1968; Ehrlich and Holdren 1971). Dunlap and Catton (1979) articulated additional insights about the important role of culture and social change as well, and their simultaneous attention to subjective culture and objective material conditions, led to their label as the "new human ecologists" (Buttel 1987). Dunlap and Catton maintained the Dominant Western Worldview (DWW) of the Human Exceptionalist Paradigm (HEP) was in the process of being supplanted by the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), which was a greening of values. This rational awareness of the interdependence of humans and nature was argued to be the single most important mechanism for reversing the harmful objective impacts of population, affluence, and technology (i.e., IP AT). Indirectly, then, a national modernization of values emerging from societal organization and institutions can help overcome the direct and indirect effects on the environment of modernization, including its production, consumption, and waste. World-polity perspectives (D. J. Frank 1999; Meyer et al. 1997) relatedly emphasize that coun- tries tend to conform to worldwide norms as they become more deeply incorporated into the global system, with related tendencies to develop state legal codes and systems of enforcement, ministries of the environment, and consequent environmental reforms. Thus, the environmentally</page><page sequence="4">Kick and McKinney 259 friendly norms developed in some nations of the global North or core of the system may be adopted by hierarchically weaker nations in the global South or the periphery of the system. Whether these reforms are actually undertaken is, however, open to question. The discussion of whether behaviors necessarily follow purported beliefs and attitudes has long been questioned (for discussion of environmental attitudes and behavior, see Buttel 1987:472-75; Scott and Willits 1994). Environmentalism may be symbolic, in that many states offer only a superficial compliance with environmental norms. It is further unclear whether reforms, if implemented, are effectual (Buttel 2003; Fischer and Freudenberg 2004). Also, environmental values to the con- trary, the norms of the Washington Consensus may prove themselves to be an overwhelming and opposing force shaping both the economic and environmental activities of all actors in the mod- ern world system. Political-Economic Approaches The political-economic tradition, as we bundle it, encompasses "metabolic rift" (Foster 1999; O'Connor 1998), the treadmill of production (Schnaiberg 1980; Schnaiberg and Gould 1994), and world-systems/dependency theory (A. G. Frank 1978; Wallerstein 1974). We do not claim these approaches adopt an identical focus or even that they share the same foundational assump- tions. Further, we do not claim that we are exhaustive in our treatment of all political-economic approaches that specify direct or indirect dynamics that impact the environment (see, for exam- ple, Hooks and Smith 2005). However, along with perspectives already discussed, many of their themes spring from a comparable causal logic that greatly facilitates an articulation among all of the perspectives we integrate into a model of ecological footprints. Metabolic rift theorists differ in their particular emphases (see, for example, Foster 1999; Moore 2000), but they adopt the classical arguments of Marx to enlighten contemporary (and historical) environmental sociology. They follow Foster (1999:373) especially in revisiting Marx's concern over the primary ecological crisis of his day, "the problem of soil fertility within capitalist agriculture" as well as his concerns with overpopulation, deforestation, and urban pol- lution. Capitalism drives soil depletion and the collection of formerly rural populations into urban centers where they produce and consume finished products, disturbing the metabolic inter- action between humans and the earth. The city-country divide represents the "metabolic rift between man and earth," which attends capitalist production, and embodies Marx's concerns over both ecological and human sustainability (Foster 1999:384). Thus, for Marx, the productive organization of capitalism spurs much of what we typically refer to as "urbanization and modern- ization," and indirectly fuels environmental degradation. Treadmill of production theorists focus on the causative role of new energy and chemical- intensive technology in creating an ever greater demand for natural resources, increasing waste streams and the toxicity of chemicals (Gould, Pellow, and Schnaiberg 2004; Schnaiberg 1980). It is the treadmill of production, run by treadmill elites, that plays a determinative role in exacer- bating consumption, and as a result, the environmental footprint of nations. A particularly insightful aspect of the approach is that to some degree, the movement of U.S. capital abroad has reduced ecological withdrawals and waste additions within the United States but has increased environmental disruptions in the countries to which the productive capital and waste have been transferred (Gould et al. 2004:19). The organization of the capitalist treadmill thus contributes directly and indirectly to adverse environmental consequences around the world. According to world-system and related dependency approaches (Baran 1957; Cardoso and Faletto 1979; A. G. Frank 1978; Galtung 1971; Wallerstein 1974), the organization of unequal exchanges between nations in different structural positions in the global system is deeply rooted in the legacies of hundreds if not thousands of years of near-global, hierarchical structure (Chase- Dunn and Hall 1997; A. G. Frank 1978; Wallerstein 1974, 2004). Quite simply put, and</page><page sequence="5">260 Sociological Perspectives 57(2) consistent with long-standing theories of capitalist expansion and imperialism (e.g., Luxembourg 1921; Marx 1976), a result of these processes is that the modernized, postindustrial, and most profitable modes of production are maintained in North Atlantic core nations, while the least profitable modes of production such as agricultural and mineral or raw material extraction are undertaken in peripheral nations (Bunker 1984, 1985; Bunker and Ciccantell 2005). Core invest- ments and free trade agreements export periphery resources to core regions, increasing the well- being of the core relative to the periphery. As well, natural resources, land, labor, and capital in the periphery are unequally compensated for in markets of global exchange (Baran 1957; A. G. Frank 1978; Galtung 1971). The organization of these economic disadvantages limits the relative gains in sustainable modernization (i.e., urbanism and economic development) of the periphery of the world system. The hierarchy of core, semiperiphery, and periphery nations (Wallerstein 1974) aggravates myriad, position-specific environmental adversities indirectly, via a range of domestic attributes specified in the theorizations treated earlier. For instance, world-system dynamics, directly or indirectly, have been linked to the ecological footprint (Jorgenson and Clark 2009), the produc- tion of carbon dioxide (Roberts, Grimes, and Manale 2003), methane (Jorgenson 2006), biodi- versity loss (McKinney, Kick, and Fulkerson 2010), deforestation (Burns, Kick, and Davis 2003), toxic waste disposal (Frey 1998), and general climate change (Clark and York 2005; Roberts 2001; York, Rosa, and Dietz 2003b). The globally contextualized nature of these indirect pro- cesses affecting the national footprint - modernization, natural capital endowments, and eco- nomic structure - is modeled and empirically examined below (Figure 1). Global Context, Domestic Dynamics, and Footprint Outcomes There is little question that the rise of industrial capitalism has exacerbated anthropogenic caus- atives such as fossil fuel burning, which are overwhelming natural carbon sinks and producing climate change (Clark and York 2005) within the context of global capitalist expansion. The sizable populations of the core and semiperiphery,5 in particular, significantly threaten the global environment in a variety of ways, as shown by virtually all interpretations and empirical treat- ments outlined above. For present purposes, however, we emphasize the indirect effects of the organization of the global hierarchy on other key domestic dynamics taken from the perspectives reviewed above that are relevant to the ecological footprint.6 As emphasized in POET, IP AT, Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT), and political-economic approaches such as the treadmill of production, metabolic rift, and world- systems/dependency perspectives, the affluence of a population has clear, expansionary implica- tions for consumptive capacity and, thus, the ecological footprint. Nations in the core zones of the capitalist world economy have much greater affluence (Gross Domestic Product per capita [GDP/C]), dramatically increasing their ecological footprint (see, for example, York et al. 2003a). A relatively smaller population in a core country can create a much larger ecological footprint (e.g., Belgium, Denmark) than a highly populated peripheral nation, due to differentials in domestic organization and related consumptive patterns. By itself, these processes dominate the ecological footprint for the core, even if there are a variety of other, interrelated global and domestic dynamics, which partly counteract them. For instance, the most powerful actors in the global social organization can "externalize" some envi- ronmental degradation by transferring production in industrial, manufacturing, agricultural, and mining sectors to other structural settings in the world system, impacting their environments adversely. Further, core nations are far more deeply integrated into the world society in a way that fosters greater participation in global culture (Meyer et al. 1997), which according to some variants of world-polity theory (D. J. Frank, Hironaka, and Schofer 2000), and the POET model in its later articulations (Dunlap 2008:479; Dunlap and Catton 1979:251), 7 should reduce</page><page sequence="6">Kick and McKinney 26 1 environmental degradation in the core. Recall, however, the contrasting consequences that accompany the dominant Washington Consensus global ideology and policy set, which height- ens global production and consumption that, in turn, exacerbate environmental degradation. As well, the periphery is the destination for the export of many core toxins. Some criticize this so-called "pollution haven hypothesis" as exaggerated, or downright wrong (Kearsley and Riddle 2010). Nonetheless, Jorgenson (2009) identifies pernicious environmental consequences for human health of core foreign direct investment, and Pellow (2007) offers an especially compel- ling description of the United States' and Western Europe's "recycling" of "e-waste" to Western Africa. Even if all these partially countervailing forces hold true, the ecological footprint of the periphery is far lower than that of the core. World-system arguments also emphasize that in contrast to the core and periphery, semiper- ipheral nations occupy an intermediate position and role in the global division of labor, and therefore in the world's treadmill of production. Modernization, urbanism, and the related meta- bolic rift have been initiated and in some cases (e.g., Brazil, the "Asian Tigers," India, China) are advancing rapidly, resulting in intermediate levels of wealth and urbanism (Foster 1999) for the semiperiphery when compared with the periphery, but not when compared with the core. The expansive and increasing manufacturing sectors of the semiperiphery, coupled with its continu- ing agricultural production and mineral extraction, typically generate some of the most serious environmental consequences in the world system, albeit intermediate in the degree of expansion between the national and global footprints of core and periphery. Specifically, there are a number of treatments in the literature that posit the advantaged position of industrialized countries is pos- sible only because of unequal exchanges the semiperiphery undertakes with less developed coun- tries for raw materials, extracted resources, and manufactured goods (A. G. Frank 1978). Due to lax labor laws (Moghadam 2005) and virtually nonexistent environmental regulations (McMichael 2004), the advanced developing countries of the semiperiphery tend to be organized in such a way that they are under the control of a small class of elite business affiliates with local and increasingly global political power (Sklair 1999). This allows them to direct the production, extraction, manufacture, and sale of a circumscribed set of commodities, globally, with adverse consequences for their national ecological footprints. A number of authors identify these pro- cesses as flourishing during the last three decades, during the era of what is commonly termed globalization , neoliberalism , or the Washington Consensus. Sociologists have not delved deeply into the role of national and global monetary policy in producing modernization and its environmental consequences (Özler and Obach 2009).8 As an illustration of their relevance, however, consider the debate over whether the economic policies of the era, supported most forcefully by the core and some semiperipheral powers, have harmed or aided economic advance across power levels in the system. It is plausible, based on world- system arguments and many of the themes driving political-economic theories of the environ- ment, that the "open markets" and "sound money" defining the modern Washington Consensus (Krugman 1995) have promoted the well-being of powerful nations at the expense of weaker ones. This is precisely what is argued by the World Bank's former senior vice-president and chief economist, Nobel recipient Stiglitz (2007). As well, Stiglitz indicts liberalization for its degrad- ing of the world's environment (see also Bunker and Ciccantell 2005). In addition to this, environmental outcomes for the semiperiphery include land, water, and air pollution, springing not only from export and import patterns that resemble the periphery, and include "e-waste," but also from their increasing assumption of the former role of the core as a global technological leader and manufacturer of textiles, leather, wood, paper, refined petroleum products, chemicals, rubber, and motor vehicles (e.g., China, India, Mexico, India). Taken together these pose increasing threats to the semiperiphery 's environmental quality and national footprints. We emphasize as well that much of the manufacturing profile of the semi- periphery results from the organization of production and trade within, between, and across</page><page sequence="7">262 Sociological Perspectives 57(2) nations (Robinson 2004; Sklair 1999), furthering the transfer of the ecological footprint from core to noncore settings. We subsequently model and test the essentially linear effects of the structural positions of nations in the world system as they operate through such domestic dynamics. Alternative Articulations: Ecological Modernization and " Weak Sustainability " These approaches offer interpretations that focus primarily on forces endogenous to nations that contrast sharply with the theoretical expectations outlined above. They include ecological mod- ernization theory (EMT) and the "weak sustainability" approach taken by some environmental economists (Solow 1993).9 The central thesis of EMT is that environmental problems can be solved through modernizing existing social, political, and economic institutions. Environmental reform and state environmen- talism have been theorized to be a "luxury" of the more economically and technically advanced or modernized countries of the world (Mol and Buttel 2002; see also Buttel 2000). EMT suggests that individuals and organizations globally will eventually see the value of investing in green technologies and engaging in a variety of environmentally friendly practices (Mol and Buttel 2002). They will push for stronger environmental laws and enforcement. Thus, the main causal mechanism of state environmentalism - consistent with the view of some of the "new human ecologists" and world-polity theorists noted above - is the changing cultural importance of the environment and a shift to more environmentally rational behaviors. A difference is that the strongest EMT positions see these processes as globally inevitable. While paralleling world- polity theory, their argumentation also is evident, albeit in weaker form, in the approaches of those economists who adopt the "weak sustainability" perspective. Few sociologists theoretically develop and empirically incorporate the weak sustainability arguments made by a number of economists. Some weak sustainability proponents eschew the dilemma of finite resources based on the assumption of substitutability of human advances and technological innovations for natural resources (Hartwick 1978, 1992; Solow 1974, 1993). They typically emphasize that as the world deepens its ecological footprint beyond apparent sustain- ability, this can be offset by human-engineered, compensatory mechanisms (Neumayer 2010). That is, in a world of extensive resource depletion, accumulation of other forms of capital makes commodity production possible. To illustrate, technologically intensive hydroponie methods for cultivating food can remedy the absence of naturally fertile soil due to resource depletion; other organizational changes such as manufactured flood control management and dam infrastructure can adjust for repetitive flooding resulting from deforestation. Further, it has been argued that stocks of human, manufactured, and natural capital are fun- gible; consequently, advances in human and manufactured forms of capital negate natural capital losses. Reflective of the weak sustainability stance on the substitutability among these forms of capital is the "genuine savings rate" (Hamilton 1994; Neumayer 2010), which is a dynamic cap- tured in national accounts statistics now collected routinely by the World Bank (see also De Soysa and Neumayer 2005; S. Dietz and Neumayer 2004). Here, the concept refers to "all utility- relevant stocks of capital including man-made capital, natural capital, human capital, as well as (in principle at least) social capital, from traditional net savings, which refers only to man-made or produced capital" (Neumayer 2010:126). These weak sustainability advocates optimistically propose that multiple capital accumulations can be translated into favorable outcomes that out- pace the ecological footprint, as well as a variety of other pernicious environmental consequences (see Neumayer 2010). If the approach of these economists is accurate, they have identified a palliative to environmental degradation that may help to offset the many negative effects identi- fied in most other far less optimistic portrayals of the future of the global environment and one component of particular interest, the ecological footprint.</page><page sequence="8">Kick and McKinney 263 Strong sustainability advocates generally question weak sustainability assumptions and mea- sures, such as the "genuine savings rate," to gauge sustainability, opting instead for the use of more ecologically based measures of environmental pressures, such as the ecological footprint. Circumventing debates on the merit of indicators, we assess sustainability in a framework that embraces the ecological footprint, which is preferred by strong sustainability advocates. We add to this approach by testing the effects of the "genuine savings rate" measure adopted by weak sustainability adherents (for discussion, see Neumayer 2010: 126-68) on the ecological footprint. Thus, we capture the empirical linkages between these two seemingly competing interpretations to assess bridges between these related, though contrary, approaches to sustainability. Data and Measurement Dependent Variable The ecological footprint is the preferred indicator of strong sustainability advocates, as an ecologi- cally sound measure, which we use as our dependent variable. Typically, the total ecological foot- print is comprised of the amount of land used in the production of crops, grazing land used in the production of animal products, forest land used in the production of wood and paper, sea area used in the production of fish and seafood, land used for housing and infrastructure, and forest cover needed to absorb carbon dioxide emissions that result from energy consumption (Wackernagel et al. 2000; York et al. 2003a).10 We concur with many others that the multi-component approach of Wackernagel et al. (2000) is, in principle, conceptually superior to others due to its inclusion of a variety of impacts, and because it can account for impacts "wherever they occur geographically" (Jorgenson and Clark 201 1; York et al. 2003a:282). The latter advantage is argued to overcome the so-called "Netherlands Fallacy" (Ehrlich and Holdren 1971), whereby the causes of environmental problems within the borders of one country are misattributed to that country alone, when in fact these problems may stem from other parts of the world. As well, the measure is inclusive, based on a rigor- ous calculation methodology, widely used both as a descriptor and dependent variable; has demon- strated sufficiently high face validity; and is available for a sizable sample of nations (Jorgenson and Clark 201 1). Since our focus is not on population and the total footprint, and others have estimated their virtual statistical identity (see York et al. 2003a), we adopt the per capita footprint measure (for 2006) used in studies comparable with ours (Jorgenson and Clark 2009, 201 1; Jorgenson, Clark, and Kentor 2010). The appendix lists the 136 developed and developing countries included in our analy- sis. While findings are reported for all nations sampled, subsampling in line with the world-system position variable yielded consonant results across positions, as discussed later. We note that among industrial countries, the "carbon component" dominates, while for our developing countries' sample, in 43 percent of the countries analyzed, another component con- tributed more than carbon to the country's footprint profile (World Bank 2009). In addition, in more than 70 percent of the cases analyzed, the aggregated scores for the other components outdistanced the carbon score. Yet, there is a comparative homogeneity across measures, yield- ing a composite alpha that is defensible (.65 - see Garson 2013). Along with the many other studies mentioned earlier, Bagliani et al. (2008:653), who use the measure, view it as "a powerful indicator of the dynamics of renewable resource use, capturing a significant share of environ- mental pressure both on the input side (extraction of almost all renewable resources), and on the output side (waste absorption and C02 sequestration)." Perhaps even more persuasive is that our findings remain robust across developed and developing nations (as treated later). Independent Variables Global political economy. We use the measure of world-system position developed by Kick and asso- ciates (201 1), for the period 1995-1999. This measure is essentially a replication of the findings</page><page sequence="9">264 Sociological Perspectives 57(2) presented by Snyder and Kick (1979) updated to measure world-system positions for the modern period and not the early 1960s. As in Snyder and Kick, the measure is based on a multiple-network analysis (using UCINET) of transnational economic, political, cultural, and military linkages among 160 countries. Specifically, the network analysis is comprised of ties between nations across four relational dimensions - commodity exports/imports (World Bank 2009), international, non- governmental organizations (Beckfield 2008), inter-nation embassy sponsorship, and arms trans- fers between countries (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 2007). When the 10 clusters of countries derived are arrayed in a matrix, densities are calculated to reflect the degree of overall interconnectedness between the clusters, or the relative scope of the power and dependency of each cluster over the others. Hence, as would be expected, Kick et al. (2011) show the most powerful countries of the North Atlantic core lead the global hierarchy and the least powerful coun- tries of Africa comprise the bottom of the world hierarchy or the true periphery. The newly indus- trializing countries stand in between in a roughly, hierarchically arranged "semiperiphery." This measure is multidimensional, recent, in line with a more comprehensive interpretation of structural positions of power in the world system (Chase-Dunn 1989; Galtung 1971; Lloyd, Mahutga, and De Leeuw 2009; Snyder and Kick 1979; Wallerstein 1974) and evidences a high degree of substantive and empirical overlap with prior efforts (Kentor 2000; Snyder and Kick 1979). We acknowledge, however, that this approach is one of two primary and defensible net- work lineages in the literature (Lloyd et al. 2009), which also includes efforts that use only eco- nomic networks to measure nations' ties. Washington consensus . From around 1980 onward, weak sustainability processes have operated in the context of what has variously been known as "the Washington Consensus," "neo-liberal- ism," "globalization," or "market fundamentalism" (Davis and Monk 2007; Harvey 2005; Roy, Denzau, and Willett 2007; Stiglitz 2007; Williamson 1990). While Williamson (1990) offered 10 key characteristics of this ideal-typical model primarily for Latin American nations, it is Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman (1995:29) who generalized in summative fashion captures it best when he says, "One may, however, roughly summarize this consensus, at least as it (has) influ- enced the beliefs of markets and governments, more simply. It is the belief that Victorian virtue in economic policy - free markets and sound money - (that) is the key to economic develop- ment." Krugman's emphasis on free markets and sound money is consonant with Williamson's approach, which has become thematic of the period (see, for example, Baker 1999; Dornbusch 2000; Kiely 2005), and we use "free markets" and "sound money" as indicators of the Washing- ton Consensus in our estimation, taken for 2004 from Gwartney and Lawson's (2009) Economic Freedom Network data. The first - access to sound money - accounts for the average annual growth of money supply, annual GDP growth, inflation rates, and foreign currency freedoms. The second - freedom to trade internationally - includes international trade taxes, tariff rates, trade barriers, exchange rates, size of trade sector, and capital market controls, among others. For elaboration of the methodology behind the economic freedoms calculations, we refer the reader to Gwartney and Lawson (2009). High scores on the index components indicate a stable mone- tary system and minimal barriers to international trade. We specify the Washington Consensus as conditioned by the world system and ecological factors elaborated below. We expect nations with higher positions of power in the world system to be more likely to support the U.S.-initiated enactment of the Washington Consensus globally. Global political-economic interpretations on the environment posit neoliberal economic policies are at odds with sustainability, thus predicting this indicator will increase the ecological footprint (see, for example, Özler and Obach 2009). We test attendant hypotheses that neoliberalism boosts capital accumulation, which is captured by our measure of weak sustainability, insofar as stocks of human and manufactured capital increase. Thus, the Washington Consensus latent vari- able is specified as directly and indirectly affecting the ecological footprint via its effects on modernization and weak sustainability.</page><page sequence="10">Kick and McKinney 265 Modernization. An advantage of our analytic technique, structural equation modeling (SEM), is the ability to use latent indicators for a concept, when those indicators, if used simultaneously as regressors, would otherwise induce multicollinearity. Affluence and urbanization are taken as latent indicators of modernization in our model of the ecological footprint, which reflects the literature on the modernization process (Durkheim [1893] 1997;Rostow 1955) and is empirically validated by the SEM analysis.1 1 National affluence (or economic output and prosperity) is oper- ationalized using the conventional measure, GDP/C for the year 2005. GDP/C is a continuous variable measured in constant U.S. dollars, log transformed to address skewness,12 and taken from World Bank (2009). Data measuring the percent urban for each country are from the World Bank for the year 2005. We specify that modernization is conditioned by world-system position and by the Washington Consensus, directly and positively, while modernization directly increases the ecological foot- print. This is posited by IPAT/STIRPAT, metabolic rift, treadmill of production, and world- system/dependency themes, among others. POET formulations also could be used to articulate the indirect impacts of global organization in a way comparable to world-system/dependency theory and could be tied in similar ways to the other theorizations. Weak sustainability. The ecological modernization indicators, GDP/C and percent urban squared (to test the Kuznets curve hypothesis - see Ehrhardt-Martinez 1998), are not elaborated here because they failed under all estimation circumstances to be related to the footprint, although their measurement may be inferred from our discussion of those two components above. How- ever, we do specify the effect of weak sustainability on the footprint. Weak sustainability is measured by the national genuine savings rate, 2005, as reported by the World Bank (2009). The genuine savings rate13 and the ecological footprint rank among the favored indices of national sustainability (Pillarisetti and van den Bergh 2010:49), although comparisons demonstrate the relative lack of parity in assumptions, measurement, and ultimate conclusions regarding national sustainability performance (Pillarisetti and van den Bergh 20 10). 14 We note that criticisms of the genuine savings indicator indict its assumptions, including the assumption of substitutability among capitals and the assumption of investing domestic savings in human or manufactured capital, its failure to account for regional sustainability dynamics, and the lack of consideration of international trade (see, for example, Ayres, van den Bergh, and Gowdy 1998). However, we accept the arguments of the World Bank and proponents of the measure, who most frequently propose its use until an unambiguously better measure is discovered. As described, the measure reflects the weak sustainability assumption of substitutability (see Neumayer 2010), as well as the World Bank's parallel articulation of the role of multiple capitals in the world's environmental future (Everett and Wilks 1999). 15 According to Neumayer (2010:77), "proponents of WS sincerely believe that in the end economic growth will be rather beneficial and not harmful for the environment," and he goes on to state, "the conjecture that economic growth will improve environmental conditions (is) the main proposition of WS with respect to environmental degradation." Thus, we test the proposition that weak sustainability springing from the Washington Consensus mitigates the ecological footprint, which bodes well for sustainability. Ecological variables . Dunlap and Catton (1979) voice POET's utility in specifying ecological determinants of a range of national outcomes (see also Bunker and Ciccantell 2005), which is a component of the "ecological complex" (Duncan 1961:145). Diamond (1997) persuasively ties ecological determinants such as climate and the geographical area of Eurasia to the ancient and contemporary fate of societies. Further, all else constant, nations in colder climates simply require more energy for heating, with companion effects on their footprints (York et al. 2003a:294). To capture such impacts, we model latitude, taken from Espenshade (1993), who provides the world's climatic zones (York et al. 2003a).

Arable land. Total arable land area for 2000 (World Bank 2009) also is included as another eco- logical determinate. It captures expanses of land cut off from the central activities of the world system, being land under temporary crop utilization (typically for home usage), meadows, and fallow land, arable land will be associated with relative inertia and lower levels of the footprint than more active geographical areas. Drawing on global political-economic interpretations that neoliberal economic policies seek to maximize the integration of land for productive uses in global markets of exchange, we expect arable land to be negatively associated with the Washing- ton Consensus. Analysis We include in our analysis all countries for which data are available, resulting in 136 countries (see appendix). This decision is based on the theoretical traditions from which we draw, in par- ticular world-systems theory, which posits all nations in the world are organized in a global divi- sion of labor that affects a wide range of outcomes in different ways across the three hierarchically arranged tiers. There are many convincing arguments in foundational (Wallerstein 1974), tempo- rally intermediate (Snyder and Kick 1979), and contemporary articulations (see, for example, Babones and Chase-Dunn 2012) that when conducting analyses of the world system, all nations should be included, and we adopt this position in the analysis that follows.16 We think it is also important to report that in our rough replication of several prior regression- based studies, we found a number of commonly used regressors that were essentially linear combinations of the others, and hence the concerns raised about multicollinearity earlier (see Table 1 - bivariate correlations).17 We also found unacceptably high VIFs (Variance inflation factor; over 10, when Allison 2012 recommends no more than 2.5 and Garson 2013 recommends a maximum of 4 to 5), and condition numbers (over 279, when the generally accepted threshold is 30 - see Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch 2004). Under conditions of multicollinearity, in addition to other untoward consequences, widened confidence intervals can lead to the false rejection of true hypotheses (and the theories from which they are derived). We adopt an alternative approach to the current norm in sociology, in using SEM, which maximizes the reliability of results derived from statistical analyses that include highly correlated</page><page sequence="12">Kick and McKinney 267 predictor variables. Further, one of our positions is that cross-national quantitative studies of the per capita footprint across all nations are relatively new, and elimination of alternative perspec- tives is less important at this point than examining possible points of compatibility. In the present case, of course, we weave central hypotheses from key theorizations, and SEM permits examina- tion of the magnitudes, and signs of direct and indirect effects as specified by that interweaving. For instance, we follow the logic of POET and world-systems/dependency theoreticians, who have initiated construction of rather comprehensive direct and indirect effects models. We address the utility of such synthetic models in more depth later, as an implication of our study. Further, while analytical tests cannot serve as substitutes for superior theorization, it can be use- ful for examining the directionality of causal relationships and, thus, aid in subsequent theory construction. As illustrations, we note that weak sustainability might not only impact the ecologi- cal footprint but also affect modernization, and that the footprint might affect modernization too, contrary to theorization. SEM permitted a statistical rejection of these possibilities and suggested the alternative relationships we report. The SEM design also can be used to address a range of other technical difficulties, including measurement error, heteroscedasticity, skewness and kurtosis, and influential outliers (Bollen 1989) that plague cross-national research (Bollen and Jackman 1985). The inclusion of latent variables reduces multicollinearity in the model, as indicators that are highly collinear are com- bined into one composite measure (Bollen 1989; Garson 2009). SEM also appears to be espe- cially suited to causal environmental treatments (see Grace and Bollen 2005). Figure 1 results show fine model fit statistics (root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .049; incremental fit index [IFI] = .989; comparative fit index [CFI] = .989) (Byrne 2009; Garson 2009). They represent model fit after multiple iterations in which a variety of causal pathways were empirically estimated and deleted when coefficients or model fit became insignificant statistically (e.g., RMSEA &gt; .08; CFI &lt; .9). Securing acceptable fit statistics in this phase of SEM specification permits the interpretation of stable, unbiased coefficient estimators. Before proceeding, we mention the regressors that we tried, but which fell short in our model estimation efforts - population growth, recycling rates, percent of renewable energy sources, rates of foreign direct investment, gross capital formation, the squares of the modernization indi- cators (GDP/C; % urban) used to test for the Environmental Kuznet's Curve (EKC), radios per 1 ,000 population, percent GDP in service sectors, percent GDP in manufacturing sectors, percent GDP in agricultural sectors, international environmental treaty ratification, the number of envi- ronmentally focused IGOs (International governmental organizations), and a number of military measures (see Hooks and Smith 2005; Jorgenson et al. 2010). Model results show that virtually all pathways point to globally increasing footprints rather than reductions in them. Ultimately, the hierarchical organization of the global system, greater power in the world capitalist system spurs further modernization (by inference at a relatively slower pace in part of the semiperiphery and the bulk of the periphery), indirectly exacerbating the ecological footprint of core nations especially, but of the entire system too. In general, the results conform to our earlier discussion of the increasing footprint profile that accompanies proportionately greater positions of national power in the world-system hierarchy. In addition to world-systems theory, this is precisely the emphasis of metabolic rift, treadmill of production, IPAT/STIRPAT interpretations, and undoubtedly POET themes as well. The coef- ficients from world-system position to modernization, and to the Washington Consensus, the effects of the Washington Consensus on modernization, the momentous impact of modernization on the footprint, and the direct impact of the Washington Consensus on the footprint do not augur well for the ongoing impact of core countries on their own environments, or on the global envi- ronment. These pathways predict a cycle of accelerated use of the Earth's biomass, well beyond renewable levels.</page><page sequence="13">268 Sociological Perspectives 57(2) We note that while this production and consumption cycle is somewhat geographically local- ized (the coefficient for latitude is .27 for the Washington Consensus and .15 for the ecological footprint), its effects reflect, in part, the spread of overproduction and overconsumption across the globe. As well, the coding of our latitude measure is admittedly crude, even if it follows con- vention. Fortunately, where these cycles are absent ("arable land") and the central forces of the system are not in operation, overshoot is mitigated. We interpret this effect as confirming the contradiction between strict adherence to neoliberalism (e.g., the integration of domestic produc- tive forces into global markets of exchange and minimal barriers to trade) and the relative abun- dance of land that is not contributing to the productive logic of the Consensus. Unfortunately, the long history of expansion in the world economy (Chase-Dunn and Hall 1997) and its acceleration in the modern period (Clark and York 2005; Harvey 2006; Wallerstein 1974) suggest this land, unless carefully protected, will simply be the locus of future footprint expansion for production, consumption, and waste disposal. There is at least a glimmer of hope offered in the performance of the "weak sustainability" (WS) pathway, and it is fortunate that WS measures have become an increasingly important component in the dialogue of environmental economics and in the World Bank's accounting logic (see, for example, Neumayer 2010; Everett and Wilks 1999). Ecological economists and ecological modernization theorists have not identified effective checks against the pernicious dynamics that are the locus of the human ecology and political economy interpretations more generally in the contemporary period. Yet, WS is the only pathway in the model (or in the mul- tiple iterations we tried) that results in albeit rather marginal ameliorative effects on the ecologi- cal footprint. An interpretation within the POET tradition (among others) is that the organizational form of the world system and the corresponding organizational form of the bulk of its constituent nations favor ever greater production and consumption, and not the effective conservation that might otherwise reduce the ecological footprint and environmental degradation generally. Nonetheless, if the dynamics reflected in WS were writ much larger, they might begin to offset what amounts to a singular dynamic shown in the rest of the model. At the moment, the WS relative effect is small in the extreme. Unfortunately, too, it has been objected that while the measure itself might be valid for poorer countries with negative WS values (e.g., Africa), for a variety of reasons, it may be more frail for oil-producing countries, some African countries, and some wealthy coun- tries (see, for example, Neumayer 2010: 126-27). 18 Discussion and Conclusion We began expressing the view that national and global patterns of production and consumption are placing planet Earth into a deeper and deeper biomass "deficit," where renewal is outpaced by the expansion of the ecological footprint. This line of reasoning is congruent with long- standing interpretations such as Marx's metabolic rift (Foster 1999; Marx 1976), and with ecological interpretations first articulated by the POET model (Duncan 1961). Again, POET argues that the societal mode of production and consumption (its "organization") can have significant and pernicious impacts on environmental well-being. Consonant with this empha- sis, metabolic rift, treadmill of production, and world-system/dependency theorists posit that the logic and accompanying organization of capitalism lead to ever-greater production and consumption. IPAT/STIRPAT interpretations comparably add that mounting wealth, technol- ogy, and population increases produce the same consequences. Our model validates the theme that as affluence grows, particularly in the absence of checks on population, the Earth's envi- ronment will suffer even more deeply. Returning to the POET model, it is important to expressly recognize that well beyond adverse environmental consequences that themselves</page><page sequence="14">Kick and McKinney 269 threaten global sustainability, more recent POET (re)articulations (e.g., Bailey 1990; Dunlap 2008:479) focus on the "feedback" of environment on societal organization, technology, and economic organization, although we do not expressly test or theoretically develop this asser- tion. Others have speculated on the pernicious feedback of environmental degradation on a range of national consequences (e.g., Bunker 1984, 1985). Certainly, all our model specifications encapsulate a world-system/dependency theoretical framework that articulates the logic of production, consumption, and division of labor in the global system and the nations that are constituent parts of it. Our impression is that the explana- tory power of the world system would be downplayed or overlooked if a different measure of the world system were to be used, as it often is, or if a direct-effects-only, ordinary least squares (OLS) design were used, pitting measures of the world system and its national consequences against one another as alternative, rather than as complementary and interdependent, explana- tions of the ecological footprint.19 World-systems theory is one example (POET if developed is another) of a complex theorization with direct and indirect causal pathways, and the effects of this complex of factors simply cannot be as effectively captured by a number of the more com- monly adopted analytical designs that are the mainstay of the discipline. Despite some pessimism, our estimated model suggests in regard to the global environment and the world's future that some environmental economists might be right in adopting an alterna- tive position that is more optimistic about humanity's future. They maintain that the dynamics of "weak sustainability" can offset the more negative environmental results that are foreseen in much of literature in environmental sociology. We interpret the relatively small but ameliorative effect of WS on the ecological footprint with caution, noting its positive association with the Washington Consensus, which directly aggravates the ecological footprint and might over- shadow its benefits. In a related vein, ecological modernization proponents contend that accom- panying modernization are institutional and cultural forces that can deflect or overcome environmental impact. Our results are relatively clear on these alternative approaches; for our data, their position is untenable. We acknowledge that it is possible in principle that far more aggressive domestic programs for renewable energy, recycling, construction with alternative materials, and so on could adjust the core's and the world system's environmental well-being, but we were unable to confirm these hypotheses with the data used. In any event, we advocate for a broader interest in the range of other "capitals," especially those related to geography and to the policies of global agencies such as the IMF, WTO, and World Bank (McMichael 2004; Stiglitz 2007) that are supported by the world's powers, for an informed and more environmentally sensi- tive order. There are some limitations of this analysis that we also wish to note. Longitudinal analyses in the future could be very beneficial, so long as the case base (including longer-term data availability), the appropriate interval for effects, and appropriate overtime variation are ensured. Our disclaimers suggest that longitudinal analysis in practice is not necessarily a superior technique to cross-sectional analysis, but it can be if appropriate conditions are met (see Bollen and Brand 2010). Future research may consider such an approach to ensure that time-ordered results match what we argue are causal relationships, although we are cognizant of the limitations of fixed and random effects analyses in this area of inquiry (see Babones 2009; Bollen and Brand 2010). An additional direction we suggest relates to the ecological footprint measure articulated in its present form as a multidimensional, composite measure. Along with others in the past, we</page><page sequence="15">270 Sociological Perspectives 57(2) provided a defense of the footprint measure earlier (see Wackernagel and Rees 1996 for greater detail). While we feel the measure in its current form and in the current treatment is justified for reasons considered above, future efforts might focus on those specific footprint measures that congeal most strongly as a composite, or individually. For example, while carbon dioxide foot- prints are much higher in the most developed countries, deforestation rates often are lower. In the periphery, this pattern frequently is reversed. Our theorization and analysis revitalizes some approaches that previously have been relatively overlooked in recent times (e.g., Duncan 1959, 1961; Hawley 1950). However, the questions we raise about flawed analytical techniques suggest that through measurement, method, or the absence of now-available data, some viable approaches to the environment have essentially been seriously questioned or even buried. To be more pointed, while we clearly advocate that environ- mental dynamics be studied in their global context, we find a great deal of utility in the offerings of early studies in human ecology and in the relatively complex, later theorizations that broad- ened foundational human ecology to specifically treat reciprocities among the environment, demographics, technology, and organizational forms ("the ecological complex" - POET; see Duncan 1959, 1961). Frailties in measurement and methods spur us to be far less certain that the "stack them up and mow them down" approach to testing theorizations, typically "validating or disconfirming" theo- rizations by OLS (or its derivatives) and direct effects modeling of singular hypotheses drawn from multiple theories, is optimal for achieving explanatory power in environmental sociology, or in sociology in general. We have taken a step in this direction by our estimation method and more holistic theoretical effort. We recognize that components of the technical approach we advocate (factor analysis, path analysis) has been employed in one form or another for decades; indeed, path analysis was central to analyses for quite some time in the classical, empirical stud- ies of status attainment (see, for example, Duncan 1979). SEM brings a number of innovations beyond these past utilizations. Further, our call for an integrative approach is far from new. Theoretical integration has been advocated for sociological studies in a number of treatments over the last two decades or so. Although our list is incomplete, we draw attention to the work of Turner (1991), Collins (1989), Munch (1987), Giddens (1996), Habermas ([1981] 1984, [1981] 1989), and Wright (2009). Merton's position as re-stated by Ritzer (1991:2) arguably is one of the most concrete and pertinent: [P]essimism results from the growing pains of a rapidly differentiating discipline in which the differentiation has multiplied so fast that we haven't the human resources to develop each sphere of inquiry in sufficient degree. The sociological enterprise requires a sense of tolerance rather than of battle, consolidating a mutual awareness of various theoretical orientations with a reasonable confidence that their mutual theoretical connections will be progressively defined. Our aim is less ambitious than those who advocate for a sociological paradigm that spans the discipline of sociology. For global anthropomorphic and geophysical dynamics, we suggest instead a wedding of the core themes of the theoretical strands examined in the present study, including, for example, the key insights of natural scientists (Hansen 2007; Kump, Kasting, and Crane 2004), climatologists, and geographers (Diamond 1997, 2005; Harvey 2006) in the study of the sustainability of the environment.</page><page sequence="16">Kick and McKinney 27 1 Appendix Countries Included in the Analysis Albania Algeria Angola Argentina Armenia Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bangladesh Belarus Belgium Benin Bhutan Bolivia Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina Botswana Brazil Bulgaria Burkina Faso Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Canada Central African Rep.

For additional discussion and warrant of the per capita measure, see Jorgenson (2003 :377). 2. At the onset, we note the substantial differences, indeed internal debate (Ayres, van den Bergh, and Gowdy 1998; Daly and Cobb 1989; Neumayer 2010), in conceptualizations, operationalizations, and perspectives on "sustainability," "strong sustainability," and "weak sustainability" (WS). Our approach to sustainability generally follows that of the United Nations, our approach to strong sustainability fol- lows the natural sciences in concern over the environment, and our treatment of WS is derived from neoclassical economic concerns over capital investments, monetary management, and their substitut- ability vis-à-vis existing environmental resources (S. Dietz and Neumayer 2007). 3. Our use of the term Washington Consensus refers to those policy reforms advocated by the U.S. Treasury, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund as a strategy to enact development around the world. The Washington Consensus and its ideals reflect a fundamental adherence to laissez- faire capitalism where the market reins free (Stiglitz 2007). This economic stance is also referred to as "neoliberalism," and we use the two interchangeably in the paper, though we note the latter has acquired a somewhat pejorative nature as a result of emerging critiques (see, for example, Harvey 2005). 4. One article by two pioneering environmental sociologists (T. Dietz and Rosa 1994:219) mentions the POET framework may be underidentified because all terms in the model affect one another. Certainly, Duncan anticipated much fuller models that were correctly specified using those terms, which he demon- strates in his 1961 piece, anticipating the upcoming problem with smog in Los Angeles. Further empirical applications illustrate the viability of the POET model across a wide range of topics including, but not lim- ited to, demography (Sly 1972), disasters (Donner 2007), and agriculture (Albrecht and Murdock 1984). 5. We note there are obvious exceptions to this line of argument with respect to both core nations that have relatively smaller populations (e.g., Canada, Australia) and semiperipheral and peripheral coun- tries with comparatively larger populations (e.g., India, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh). Yet, the bulk of the world's population resides in the semiperiphery with China and India alone comprising nearly 40 percent of that population. 6. We note world-system position affects population because it suspends the transition of periphery nations from more traditional agrarian societies to advanced manufacturing societies, thus sustain- ing incentives for families to have more children (or "field hands") to perform domestic labor. This dynamic essentially prevents the demographic transition (i.e., going from a society with high birth and death rates to a society with low birth and death rates; Thompson 1929) in developing nations, which results in inflated population in these areas. Clearly, the more people an environment attempts to sup- port, the greater the ecological footprint. Once again the near identity of population and the ecological footprint is a taken-for-granted in our approach and in the literature, obviating its empirical treatment in the present effort. 7. In fact, Dunlap (2008:479) candidly chronicles an early exchange with his long-time collaborator, Catton, in which Catton says, "You've got an expansion of the POET model." This is suggestive of the fact that there is a great deal of potential interdependency among the various interpretations in the</page><page sequence="18">Kick and McKinney 273 sociology of environment literature. This is one reason why we include many of these variants in our synthetic model tested by structural equation modeling. 8. For example, Özler and Obach (2009) test for the effects of laissez-faire capitalist state policies on the footprint. 9. Another sub-global approach that in comparative terms is theoretically underdeveloped, controver- sial, and empirically disconfirmed generally, proposes the Environmental Kuzneťs Curve (EKC). The EKC posits a curvilinear relationship between economic growth and environmental outcomes (Ehrhardt-Martinez 1998). That is, in the early stages of economic growth, damage to the environ- ment increases to a certain level of per capita income, and then the environmental trend reverses itself. Stern (2004) is persuasive in demonstrating that the EKC is at its demise as a tenable explanation, due to flimsy statistical evidence (Stern 2004). This position is taken by a number of comparable studies conducted outside the United States (see Bagliani, Bravo, and Dalmazzone 2008, and the studies cited there) and is consistent with our own findings. Yet, some studies find evidence for the EKC and water pollution (Paudel, Zapata, and Susanto 2005). Those seeking to corroborate our conclusions are invited to request the necessary data from us to do so. 10. We note too that we also utilize the entire footprint instead of its components only to maintain consis- tency with earlier, comparable efforts. 1 1 . We recognize that while this statement is generally true, some assessments of developing nations point to the dynamics of "overurbanization" (Kentor 1981). The periphery houses the lesser populated coun- tries in general. 12. We note that this approach successfully adjusts our variables so they conform to the assumptions of structural equation modeling. 13. The genuine savings rate "aim[s] to denote the rate at which national wealth (broadened to include human capital and natural capital) is being created or destroyed" (Everett and Wilks 1999:3). The genuine savings figure is derived from the gross national savings measure plus educational spend- ing, less consumption of fixed capital, resource depletion, and pollution damage (including losses to human health). The resultant value is normed over GNI[GNI] and as such is expressed in a percentage. For filli discussion of measurement details, we refer the reader to Everett and Wilks (1999) and Bolt, Matete, and Clemens (2002). 14. Pillarisetti and van den Bergh (2010) offer an excellent comparison of premier indicators of national sustainability, including the ecological footprint and the genuine savings measure. Although their mea- sure of the footprint includes biocapacity estimates - the same measure used by McKinney (2012) to approximate overshoot - that ours does not, their analyses point to the contradictory conclusions of national sustainability performance reached by the measures but identify 14 nations that the footprint and genuine savings measure agree are unsustainable. 15. We note nuances, which some would say reflect, instead, significant issues, remain as controversies in the measurement of this important concept. This is true even among the strongest supporters of the concept (see Neumayer 2010: 126-68). In the final analysis, we place our trust with respect to measure- ment in pioneering efforts (Neumayer 2010) and the most credible, global, relevant institutions (e.g., the World Bank). 16. We reran our analyses on various subsamples of tiers (semiperiphery, periphery, noncore) and found that while the drop in case base reduced the statistical significance of the coefficients somewhat, the signs and magnitudes of the coefficients remained very close to those reported for the full sample, indicating comparable causal patterns across the tiers of the world system. Of course, when all those patterns are taken together, they result in substantially different implications for the three tiers. These results are available upon request. 17. Although it is the partialed relationships that should be carefully inspected, too (e.g., the relationships among the coefficients and the degree to which they "push" each other in magnitude and sign, while impacting confidence intervals), bivariate associations are a baseline indicator of possible difficulties with unacceptably high intercorrelations. To quote Bollen (1989:58), "The simple bivariate correlation between explanatory variables is not sufficient for determining the extent of collinearity. The multiple correlation of each explanatory variable regressed on the other explanatory variables comes closer to measuring this dependence." 18. Again, we note the controversies that exist over the calculation, assumptions, and use of the genuine savings rate (see, for example, Everett and Wilks 1999). In its current form, it is the "best" measure</page><page sequence="19">274 Sociological Perspectives 57(2) of sustainability offered by the World Bank and advocated by WS proponents. At the very least, it provides an alternative measure to wealth (i.e., Gross Domestic Product) that accounts to some extent for social and environmental dimensions. Thus, we include it in our model and interpret its effects in an effort to synthesize what would otherwise be viewed as contradictory predictions on environmental outcomes, such as the footprint. 1 9. We note the parity in our conclusion and that offered by T. Dietz and Rosa ( 1 994) on how to reformu- late (and ultimately improve estimations of) the IPAT (impacts of population, affluence, and technol- ogy) model (283-4) "because the various driving forces interact in complex ways, it ultimately will be necessary to move from a single equation model - one that estimates only direct effects net of other variables in the model - to a systems model that estimates both direct and indirect effects of driving forces.
