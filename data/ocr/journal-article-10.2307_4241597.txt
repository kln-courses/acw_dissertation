<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW FINDS IN THE INDUS VALLEY1 By SIMONE CORBIAU URING last winter I made some archaeological researches in the upper part of the Indus Valley,2 and the results of my investigations are herein published. Some years ago, Major D. H. Gordon, a British officer on duty in the NW. Frontier Province of India, discovered that archaeological remains were coming from a mound called Sari-Dheri, near Charsadda, in the district of Peshawar. He published certain of these, which he bought from the native villagers, with what information he could gather concerning the location of the finds.3 These, in his opinion, belonged to the Graeco-Buddhist culture, that Hellenistic civilization which arose in India after the conquest of Alex- ander the Great. Now I agree with Major Gordon that some of these terra- cottas belong to the Hellenistic school of Gandharian art, towards the be- ginning of our era, but I believe that others among these objects, which show definitely an archaic style and technique, are far more ancient. They repre- sent, in fact, a new aspect of the Indus chalcolithic civilization, of which, hitherto, no traces had been found in the north (Fig. i). It is not surprising that this civilization should be found higher up along the Indus Valley, nor that it should be found in those spots where, later on, more recent populations have settled and left historical remains. On this point I wish to lay emphasis upon the fact, generally not considered, that during the first excavations at Harappa were found, not only dozens, but even hundreds of Indo-Scythian coins.4 These indicate a recent occupation of a site which is, on the other hand, correctly recorded as prehistoric, and the same has been the case, I think, for Sari-Dheri. Sari-Dheri, a site situated along the road which leads from Charsadda to Mardan, is composed of two mounds: one towards the West (Plate I, i) and another towards the East (ib. 2). Both are of great dimensions, about I50 ft. in superficies, and 24 to 40 ft. in height. As Major Gordon has pointed out, the villagers are gradually destroying them, using the earth as manure for their fields. Almost two-thirds of the western mound have already been removed, and the remaining third offers difficulties for investigation, owing to two reasons. First, because the highest part of the mound (ib. 3) allows a view into the harems of the Mohammedan village lying at its foot and therefore, although I personally was allowed to make an examination of the top, my workers had to remain below; secondly, because the portion of the mound that remains accessible to the men is crowded with tombs. It is l A communication read before the British Associa- tion for the Advancement of Science, Blackpool, 1936. 2 Cf. Bulletin des Musees Royaux d'Art et d'His- toire, 1936, no. 2, pp. 42-5.

But even this violation of the tombs (which were con- structed of unburnt bricks) offended the population, and in spite of my telling the villagers that these men, who died more than 2,000 years ago, were no relatives of theirs, they were simply horrified when bones were re- vealed by the spade of *he workers. They reverently picked up every bit of the human remnants, dug another resting-place for them, and, the fol- lowing night, went to the Khan and made so much trouble that at this mound we had to cease work. I then started to investigate the other mound, the eastern one, which was supposed to be sterile.1 Four trial pits were made at different points of the outskirts, and I had the agreeable surprise of finding that this mound, the only one which can be excavated, is as full of remains as the western one. At one spot, measuring some 3 yards by 6, I was able to dig through from top to bottom. This enabled me to ascertain that, regarding this place at least, the native assertions, upon which Major Gordon based his opinion, are inexact. For, although the villagers stated that the archaic figurines came from the Fig. i. Sketch map showing the position of Sari Dheri Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 1932, 163.</page><page sequence="3">NEW FINDS IN THE INDUS VALLEY 3 top parts of the Dheri, and the Hellenistic ones from the bottom, I found quite the contrary to be the case. See Pl. 11, 2: the Hellenistic head, which is undoubtedly Gandharian, came from 6 ft. under the surface ; the archaic head (ib. 3) was recorded 15 ft. lower at a depth of 21 ft. Numerous Hellenistic fragments were found in the upper layers, down to a depth of 10 ft. From that moment downwards began the remains of archaic style, and the Hellenistic material ceased. I was unable to make more extensive diggings at Sari-Dheri, and was just able to examine some other mounds in the neighbourhood. One of these, Sulai-Dheri (village of Rajjar, some 10 miles from Sari-Dheri) contained remains of the same periods, and showed a similar sequence of cultures, the Hellenistic remains being at the top and the archaic ones below (ib. 4, 5). As trial pits are not sufficient proof to establish a stratification definitely, I should not dare to base my opinion upon these facts only, but I rely upon the archaeological connexions of the finds (either found or purchased at Sari-Dheri) herein published. The most characteristic of these are little idols in terra-cotta which represent a naked woman, most probably a goddess of fertility (Plate in, 1, 2). These are in all points identical with the one which the Boston Museum acquired some years ago as coming from the Peshawar district, and which M. Cooma- raswamy dated as Indo-Sumerian, circa 3000 B.c.1 (Fig. 2, nos. 1-2), and to the Susa II figurines found lately by M. de Mecquenem below the Ur III level (Fig. 2, nos. 3-6). M. Coomaraswamy drew special attention to the body-ornament in form of an X that crosses the front and the back of his figurines, which he identified with the 'Channavira' of later Indian sculpture. The Sari-Dheri specimens also show that ornament, and in these instances it is often painted (Plate p?, 3). We can see distinctly the same body-ornament upon most of the terra-cotta idols of the archaic period: painted at Assur, incised at Kis (Fig. 2, nos. 12-13), in the Cyclades, in Crete, &amp;c. It was made at that time in a way much more primitive and stiff than upon the figurines of later date such as Fig. 2, no. 14. The bead decorated with white incrustation (Plate in, 4) (a technique which is found both in Mesopotamia and on the Indus in proto-historic times (Fig. 2, nos. 7-11) and the saucer-like jar covers bearing a knob in the middle (Plate v, 2) (identical with the Jamdat Nasr and Mohenjo-Daro specimens) are interesting to note. Although they afford no decisive evidence, since they are still made, they add something to the argument, since these similarities have been taken into consideration for the dating of the Mohenjo- Daro culture. I attach more importance to a peculiar feature which the Sari-Dheri figurines bear: the treatment of the eyes, made of pellets of clay separately affixed and afterwards slit in the middle in order to simulate the aperture of 1 I.P.E.K., 1928, 64-76; article India in Encyclo- pedia Britannica xii.212; Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Dec. 1927, pl. iv, 3, 90-6.</page><page sequence="4">SIMONE CORBIAU Fig. 2 i,2.

The lateral stroke can be discerned by a profile view of many specimens. This peculiar feature is so characteristic that Major Gordon himself holds it to be 'almost,if not quite,unique'.1 But I do not see this technique in the Hellenistic period at all, and I do find it upon many figurines of proto-historic times: at Mohenjo-Daro (Fig. 2, no. 15)2 at Kis (ib., 16) and upon the interesting figurine of the Jamdat Nasr level at Khafaje (Plate in, 8~9),3 which is, on other grounds, so similar to the Sari-Dheri terra-cottas.4 It should be noted that both in Mesopotamia and in India this technique disappears completely in later periods, and therefore these examples must be compared with others of Graeco-Buddhist times, if the theory of the low dating is to be maintained. Some archaic figurines from Sari-Dheri are more roughly made than these more elaborate specimens. For instance, in one case, a stand plays the r?le of legs (Plate iv, 1). This type has parallels of ancient date, i.e. at Susa II and at Alishar II (Fig. 2, nos. 17-20) and also at Mohenjo-Daro (Fig. 3, no. 1). A very suggestive type of flat idol which appears in great numbers at Sari-Dheri (Plate iv, 2-4) recalls the Aegean type of schematic figurines (Fig. 3, nos. 2-3). I do not pretend to say that they are identical in all respects, since the material and even the shapes demand a fuller discussion, but these curious idols appear to have a common religious meaning, which is obviously symbolical in the case of the figurine of which the lower part is shaped in the form of a triangle.5 This is not from chance but by deliberate intention, for the examples are many, both in Sari-Dheri (Fig. 3, no. 4) and in the archaic Sumerian levels of Mesopotamia (ib. 5-6). Dr. Frankfort; points out to me that similar flat figurines, dated of the Isin-Larsa period, found at Tall Asmar (Plate iv, 5-7) show the Isin-Larsa dotted decoration which we can observe on the Sari-Dheri triangle. The technique of black clay ornamented with white-filled incisions is well known during proto-historic times all over the Near East,6 and we can see it also at Sari-Dheri (Plate iv, 8). Further, the fan-like head-dress which is so common at Mohenjo-Daro7 (Fig. 3, nos. 7-9), the holes to fix ornaments 1 Man, Sept. 1935, 160. 2 Dr. Mackay tells me that among the non- published material of Mohenjo-Daro this feature is quite frequent. 3 I gratefully acknowledge here, for this photo- graph on pl. in, 8-9, as well as for pl. iv, Figs. 5-7, that Dr. Frankfort has authorized me to make use of these before their publication by him. 4 Compare with Plate in, 7 and Fig. 2, nos. 3-6, for the technique of the head-dress, which was presumably affixed separately, and with Fig. 2, no. 14, for the way of indicating the necklace by rows of incised dots. Note also the cone-like termination of the arms. 5 This triangle represents the pudenda region emphasized. For these symbols of the fertility cult, cf. A.

This fan-like head-dress appears also on the Chanhu-Daro figurine, Fig. 5, which bears a round ornament hanging between the breasts like the archaic figurine from Sulai-Dheri (Peshawar Dis- trict) in Bulletin des Mus?es Royaux d'Art et d'His- toire, March-April, 1936, Fig. 13.</page><page sequence="6">SIMONE CORBIAU ?.

The spindle-whorls, so numerous in Sari-Dheri, also point to ancient cultural connexions. Fig. 3, nos. 11-12, 16-17, show exact similitudes be- tween the Sari-Dheri finds and the Knossos and Jamdat Nasr spindle-whorls on the one hand (ib. 13-15), and the Anau III spindle-whorls on the other (ib. 18-19). As regards the Anau III material, we should note the similarity of many finds, among which are the terra-cotta torsos (Plate iv, 9 from Sari-Dheri, and the figure given in Pumpelly, Expl. in Turkestan, Plate 41, fig. 8). These connexions between the Indus, Anau, and the Aegean, to which the Sari-Dheri material points, are confirmed by Dr. Mackay's finds at Chanhu-Daro in Sind, where the Harappa level has yielded the characteristic hairpin ornamented with a double spiral, a type hitherto unknown in India, but well-known at Anau and in the Cyclades.1 Next we have certain ceramic specimens (Plate iv, 10), showing a profile well known in the pottery of the Jamdat Nasr period, and made of a deep-red polished ware. Numerous fragments of a grey polished pottery, sometimes turning to a real black hue, were found in quantity at Sari-Dheri. This primi- tive fabric recalls the Uruk V stratum in Mesopotamia, which is so charac- terized by its carboniferous ware that Professor Gordon Childe, noticing that it is alien in Mesopotamia, even calls the people who made it 'the red-grey pottery makers'.2 Another (Plate v, 1) made of buff-coloured clay, shows the al-* Ubaid and Cretan type of low squatting-pot with carinated shoulder (see Fig. 4, no. 1). The jar-cover (Plate v, 2) is of the Jamdat Nasr and Mohenjo- Daro type (Fig. 4, no. 2). Incidentally, I should like to lay stress upon certain definitely archaic ceramic types which I noticed among the collections of the Peshawar Museum, which point to a very ancient period of occupation in the district. Plate v, 3-4, is a vase shaped in the form of a woman, and the best analogue to it that I know comes from Assur G (Fig. 4, no. 4). I found the top part (head) of a similar vase at Sari-Dheri (Plate v, 5). (Cf. one found by Dr. Mackay at Chanhu-Daro (Fig. 6), a piece of hollow pottery also broken at a delicate part of the neck). Plate v, 6, is a fragment of pottery very peculiar in technique. It is studded all over with pellets of clay, which make a kind of decoration. This peculiar ware is met also at Susa II (Fig. 4, no. 5), at E?nunna (ib. 6), and in Crete (ib, 7). Plate v, 7, shows a most characteristic type of vessel, as no practical use can explain its double spout. Double-spouted vessels have been found both in proto-dynastic Egypt and in Crete, and are one of the strongest arguments on which Sir Arthur Evans relied to establish the correlation between the Egyptian and Cretan finds.3 Hence the case should hold good also for the dating of the Peshawar culture, and I should like to add, regarding these chronological connexions, that double-spouted vases appear also in the 1 Illustr.

The children gather what idols they can in order to sell them to foreigners or to dealers for a few annas, and it is probable that the Boston Museum acquired some of these. The British officials in the region have written to me lately that this clandestine digging is going at such a speed that probably in a couple of years nothing will remain of the Dheri. The only thing to do is to excavate Sari-Dheri with the briefest delay, before all these precious remains have disappeared for ever. The researches which I was able to carry on last winter are due to the generosity and to the disinterested foresight of a Belgian Maecenas, M. Tournay-Solvay. The enterprise was so hazardous that no official funds could be asked for the purpose, and the French maxim: 'Qui donne vite donne deux fois' proved more true than ever in the present case. Although the modesty of M. Tournay-Solvay would not even let me publish his name, I feel bound to state here what is due to him, and I am proud to say that, in our small country Belgium, the rare species of Maecenas still exists. In conclusion, I may add that a glance at the map (Fig. i) will show that this entrance of the great Indian plain is the strategic point by which all invasions have poured into India from Central Asia and from Persia: in historic times, the Mohammedan and the Afghan invasions, the conquest of Alexander the Great, the Achaemenian rule; prior to these, the Aryan migration, and, perhaps, the makers of the Indus Valley culture as well. Of all these, the Khyber Pass and the adjoining valleys are bound to reveal traces. This is indeed a fruitful and thrilling field of research, both for ethnology and for archaeology. The 'Gates of India', as they are called, hold, I feel certain, the key to some of the problems for the solutions of which we are searching. Fig. 5. Fig. 6.

Tt is interesting to find a cylinder seal in India/ writes Dr. Mackay, the excavator, 'as it is an undoubted proof of connexions, commercial or otherwise, with contemporary Elam or Sumer* ; let us note that the fantastic monster with a reptilian body, engraved in the centre of this cylinder, is similar to that represented on the Indo-Sumerian example. Two cylinders, unluckily not found in regular excavations, may be seen in the Indian Museum, Calcutta.3 They are of comparatively recent date. One represents a king wor- shipping Assur above the magic tree protected by two monsters, while the god Marduk stands on the other side of the tree. The other cylinder, octagonal in shape, is Hellenistic and was reported to have come from Taxila.4 S. CORBIAU. Fig. 5.
