<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 (2) 2004 Review Forum Leviticus as Literature (Maiy Douglas, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1999) Review Article by Ronald S. Hendel (University of California, Berkeley) Analogy in Priestly Thought A native thinker makes the penetrating comment that 'All sacred things must have their place. ' It could even be said that being in their place is what makes them sacred for if they were taken out of their place, even in thought, the entire order of the universe would be destroyed. Claude Lévi-Strauss1 In 1979 two tiny silver amulets were discovered in a burial cave near Jerusalem. The amulets date to the late seventh-sixth centuries B.C.E., and both contain the following blessing: May Yah weh bless you and keep you, May Yah weh shine his face upon you, The larger amulet breaks off at this point, and the smaller continues: And may He give you peace. This remarkable find is a slightly shorter version of the Priestly Blessing of Numbers 6:24-26, which God gives to Aaron and his sons to bless the children of Israel." These amulets, presumably worn by those buried in the cave as their final blessing, are the earliest extrabiblical attestation of verses found in the Hebrew Bible. They testify to the importance of the Priestly Blessing in the waning years of the First Temple period. The style of this blessing is graceful, rhythmic, and terse. It expresses itself through divine invocation ("May Yahweh bless you"), then turns to the liminal scene of blessing ("shine his face upon you") - alluding to the cosmic light of Yahweh's cultic presence and finally to the experienced result of the blessing ("give you peace"). The repeated object "you" (4x) provides a rhythmic focus on the worshiper who experiences the blessing. In its powerful words and ritual context, this priestly discourse is performative in accomplishing what it invokes - joining Yahweh and the worshiper in the nexus of divine blessing. The priest's words to the Israelite are, in this instance, sublime and spiritual. The bulk of priestly discourse in the Pentateuch is, in contrast, somewhat less sublime. The difficulty of this discourse - and of the purity system that is its ideological core - is the problem I wish to address, drawing inspiration from a recent book by Mary Douglas. The following is a representative sample of difficult priestly discourse,1" from the instructions on diagnosing and treating a house afflicted with mold or fungus: Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: "When you come to the land of Canaan that I am giving you as a possession, and when I afflict a house of the land of your possession with scaly skin disease and the owner of the house comes and tells the priest, saying: 'It seems to me like an affliction on the house,' the priest shall command that they clear out the house before the priest comes to examine the affliction, so that whatever is in the house will not become impure. Afterward the priest will come to examine the house. He will examine the affliction, and if the affliction on the walls of the house consist of greenish or reddish eruptions and its appeareance is beneath the wall, the priest shall go out of the house to the entrance of the house, and he shall quarantine the house for seven days. The priest shall return on the seventh day and inspect, and if the affliction has spread on the walls of the house, the priest shall command that they remove the stones on which is the affliction and take them outside of the city to an unclean place. He shall have the house scraped throughout and have them take out the plaster that they scraped outside the city to an unclean place. They 172</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 (2) 2004 Review Forum shall take other stones and put them in place of the stones, and take other plaster and plaster the house. And if the affliction retums and spreads in the house after he has removed the stones and after he has scraped the house and after plastering, the priest shall come back and inspect, and if the affliction has spread in the house, it is persistent scaly skin disease in the house; it is impure. He shall break down the house - its stones, its timber, and all the house's plaster -and bring it outside the city to an impure place. Whoever enters the house during the days of its quarantine shall be impure until evening. Whoever lies down in the house shall wash his clothes. Whoever eats in the house shall wash his clothes. (Lev 14:33-47) This is typical priestly discourse - repetitious, inelegant prose, filled with precise detail but lacking explanation or persuasive diction. It is priestly instruction for priests, a specialized discourse for specialists, which seems hermetic and strange to modern ears. Why, after all, is so much attention lavished on the problem of houses with "scaly skin disease", a medical term that here refers to mold or mildew? The significance of this elaborate instruction is obscure. It probably seemed obscure to the early rabbis also, as evidenced by the comment: "A stricken house has never come into existence and is never going to come into existence."v The problem of priestly thought, particularly in the cultic instructions in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, is that it is so difficult to penetrate. In the eyes of many nineteenth and early twentieth century biblical scholars, the priestly writings were a collection of "dead works" - the decline and detritus of a once vibrant religious culture." We have learned since to read the text without such antinomian lenses (stemming from anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic biases), but it remains forbidding. Jacob Milgrom, a major figure in the modern réévaluation of the priestly writings, argues that Theology is what Leviticus is all about. It pervades every chapter and almost every verse. It is not expressed in pronouncements but embedded in rituals. Indeed, every act, whether movement, manipulation, or gesticulation, is pregnant with meaning.™ Yet even if Milgrom is correct (and I find his explication of the rituals largely convincing), the significance of the ritual acts does not directly address the problem of the literary discourse. Why is the priestly theology "not expressed in pronouncements," as Milgrom observes? Why is the priestly style of thought - the dry descriptions, the absence of explanation, the inexplicable transitions - so impenetrable? Stephen Geller rightly observes: The problem of P is not so much that he is reticent, as the intimation one receives, in view of the obvious complexity and sophistication of his editorial endeavor, that this reticence is somehow willed, in some peculiar way intrinsic to his message."" Perhaps priestly discourse doesn't want or need explanation - it guards its difficulty closely. Perhaps, like Job, we are not intended to understand. Styles of Thought In her recent illuminating book, Leviticus as Literature ,IX Mary Douglas returns to the biblical book that she explored in her anthropological classic, Purity and Danger. x Building on her recent studies and the substantial anthropological literature on "modes of thought,'"" she proposes a theoretical model for understanding the nature of priestly discourse in Leviticus. She details the style of thought that she calls "analogical" or "correlative," which contrasts with the more familiar mode of "rational-instrumental" thinking. The latter is the style of modern critical discourse: Our logic ... organizes experience in theoretical terms. Rational construction based upon it always goes in a direction away from the concrete particular towards the universal .... For example, rational construction creates contexts in which 'human nature,' or 'human rights,' or 'equality under the law,' can be invoked.™ This analytical style of thinking, which in our culture descends from classical Greece and Enlightenment 173</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 (2) 2004 Review Forum Europe, tends to flourish in a social context in which argument and persuasion are valued and politically effective: "The main precondition of this movement is the liberation of enquiry, a world made open to question and doubt, and the resulting high value set on persuasion."™1 Such was the world of the ancient Greek polis and the individualist world of modern urban society. In contrast, analogical or correlative thinking operates by a more associative logic: It is not based on dialectical principles, its arguments do not run on a linear, hierarchical model. It is based on analogical association, "it is 'horizontal' in the sense that it involves the association of concrete experienceable items." x,v Analogical thought is found in many times and places, but it seems to flourish in social contexts that are highly ordered, in which people know their place, and where inherited structures of authority rather than personal persuasion are the primary locus of political power. The dense and nested structures of analogical thought seem to do best in an environment in which social interactions are themselves dense and nested, in which a word or gesture are sufficient to communicate meaning, rather than a comprehensive explanation. This fits the highly structured world of the priests of Leviticus and provides a key to their style of thought: Leviticus' literary style is correlative, it works through analogies. Instead of explaining why an instruction has been given, or even what it means, it adds another similar instruction, and another and another, thus producing its highly schematized effect. The series of analogies locate a particular instance in a context. They expand the meaning. Sometimes the analogies are hierarchized, one within another making inclusive sets, or sometimes they stand in opposed pairs or contrast sets. They serve in place of causal explanations. If one asks, Why this rule? the answer is that it conforms to that other rule. If, Why both those rules? the answer is a larger category of rules in which they are embedded as subsets or from some of which they are distinguished as exceptions. Many law books proceed in this concentric, hierarchical way. In Leviticus the patterning of oppositions and inclusions is generally all the explaining that we are going to get. Instead of argument there is analogy. " By clarifying the different conceptual forms and the supporting social contexts of these styles of thought, Douglas explains why it is so difficult for us to read Leviticus with empathy and understanding. For those of us who live in a social world of persuasion, free inquiry, and competition, Leviticus "belongs to a now obsolete and completely foreign order of thought.'"™1 We need to learn to follow the intricate analogical ordering of Leviticus: As we read any part of Leviticus we see that the rules build up verbal analogies: the consecration of a priest has a pattern of points in common with the consecration of the altar. We should read them as projections of one another and learn from each something more about what consecration means. The same applies to analogies drawn by the ritual of consecrating a priest (Lev 8:23-4) and the ritual cleansing of a cured leper when he is to be brought back into the community (Lev 14:14). The anointing says something, but is it something about the meaning of cleansing? Or about the meaning of leprosy? Or about the meaning of priesthood? Only the whole system of analogies in which it nests will show how it is to be read. xv" Douglas offers a fresh and powerful perspective on how to read priestly discourse and follow its distinctive style of thought. In the following I wish to return to the house stricken with mildew, and to demonstrate how it can be comprehended as a piece of analogical thinking within the larger correlative structures of Leviticus and priestly thought. xvul Most of the details I will note are familiar (at least to specialists in Leviticus), but the way of approaching and synthesizing them is not. It is, as Douglas urges, a rational-instrumental path into analogical thought. Scaly Skin Disease and Analogy The immediate literary context of the mildewed house is a sequence of priestly instructions on the diagnosis and ritual purification of scaly skin disease. This word, which most translations incorrectly 174</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 (2) 2004 Review Forum render as "leprosy," refers to a class of skin disorders characterized by flaky or ulcerating skin and subcutaneous lesions. From the perspective of modern medicine, the diseases which best fit this symptomology include certain types of psoriasis, eczema, seborrhea, and also a type of severe malnutrition (Kwashiorkor, a protein deficiency). "" Leviticus 13-14 contain instructions on the diagnosis and disposition of scaly skin disease in humans, garments, and houses. The literary structure of these chapters intersperses in parallel the human and non-human instances of this condition: diagnosis of human scaly skin disease (Lev 13:1-46) diagnosis and disposition of garment scaly skin disease (Lev 13:47-59) purification/reincorporation of human healed of scaly skin disease (Lev 14:1-32) diagnosis and purification of house scaly skin disease (Lev 14:33-53) The whole section ends with a concluding summary: "This is the instruction for all diseases of (human) scaly skin disease ... and scaly skin disease of garments and houses ... to teach when it is unclean and when it is clean - this is the instruction of scaly skin disease (Lev 14:54-57). The envelope structure of this summary ("This is the instruction ... this is the instruction of scaly skin disease") corresponds well to the interleaving structure of the instructions. Clearly in this section a number of different phenomena are analogized to each other. As commentators observe, mold or fungus on houses and clothes are quite different things than human skin diseases. But the priestly writer uses the same name for all three types of conditions, thereby classing them together. This linguistic and compositional/redactional m move creates an explicit analogy between body, garments, and house, focusing on the skin or surface of each as subject to the stain of impurity. Each instance of scaly skin disease in these analogous domains is subject to similar diagnostic procedures and, when not malignant, ritual purification. Douglas notes that this analogical series "signals a return to the body/temple microcosm.'"™11 Where body and house are correlated in the "body logic" of Leviticus, particularly in the context of ritual pollution and purification, it is plausible to see a connection with other prominent bodies and houses in their relation to pollution and purification. A body/temple microcosm is richly encoded in the analogies of the scaly skin disease texts of Leviticus 13-14. Not only are the healed body and house purified by similar rites (compare 14:3-9 with 14:49-53), but so too is the sacred Tent of Meeting in Leviticus 16. The Tent does not have scaly skin disease, but is polluted invisibly by the accumulated transgressions of the Israelite people, including the sins of priests and other leaders. ""u To remedy this metaphysical disease, the high priest performs a ceremony to purify the holy place and the people. The most striking similarity in these rites of purification is the use of two animals - a pair of birds for the human and house and a pair of goats for the Tent - one of which is sacrificed and its blood applied to the site, and the other released in the wilderness. Note the similarities in the scenes of purification: Purification of person healed of scaly skin disease The priest shall order that two clean wild birds be brought for the person to be purified from scaly skin disease ... And the priest shall order that the first bird be slaughtered ... And he shall sprinkle (its blood) on the person to be purified from scaly skin disease seven times. When he has thus purified him, he shall send the wild bird to the open fields. (Lev 14:4-7) Purification of house healed of scaly skin disease He shall take for the purification two birds ... And he shall slaughter the first bird ... And he shall sprinkle (its blood) on the house seven times, and he shall purify the house with the bird's blood ... And he shall send the living bird out of the city to the open fields, and he shall cleanse the house, and it shall be purified. (Lev 14:49-53) Purification of Tent of Meeting He shall take two goats and stand them before Yahweh at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting ... He shall slaughter the goat of the purification offering ... And he shall sprinkle (its blood) on the the cover of the Ark and in front of the cover, and he shall cleanse the holy place from the pollution and transgressions of the Israelites, all their sins ... And he shall sprinkle it (viz. the altar) with the blood seven times with his finger. 175</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 (2) 2004 Review Forum Thus he shall purify it and sanctify it from the pollution of the Israelites. ... And he shall present the live goat ... And he shall send it by the hand of an appointed man to the wilderness, and the goat shall bear on it all their transgressions to a barren land, and he shall send the goat to the wilderness. (Lev 16:7-22) These scenes of purification are not the same, but they have an analogical relationship. Human scaly skin disease and house scaly skin disease are analogous to the pollution that afflicts the Tent of Meeting. The afflicted skins or coverings are also analogous. The purifying rites - involving the two animals, one slaughtered and its blood used as a ritual purifying agent, and the other cast out into the wilderness - are also clearly analogous in these details. m There are, of course, also many differences in the rites, such as the types of animals (birds vs. goats) and their ritual status (the slaughtered goat is a purification offering, and the slaughtered birds are not). By situating these scenes in a correlative relationship, the processes of pollution and rites of purification are exemplified and reciprocally intersignifying. In this analogical sense, the person with scaly skin disease and the house with mildew stains are exemplars or microcosms of the metaphysically stained Tent of God, whose periodic purification is necessary for Israel's continued existence. The bodies and houses impure from scaly skin disease serve as concrete metaphors (what T. S. Eliot called "objective correlates") of the holy Tent afflicted with the invisible disease of human transgression. To borrow Milgrom's literary metaphor for the priestly system of purification and atonement, the bodies and houses with scaly skin disease are Priestly pictures of Dorian Gray. On the analogy of Oscar Wilde's novel, the priestly writers would claim: sin may not leave its mark on the face of the sinner, but it is certain to mark the face of the sanctuary, and unless it is quickly expunged, God's presence will depart .... the sinner may be unscarred by his evil, but the sanctuary bears the scars. The sanctuary bears its scars invisibly, while its analogical projections - the bodies and houses with scaly skin disease - are tangible and ghastly exemplars of impurity. In this respect the "leper" is the projection of the defiled body, and the "leprous" house a picture of the defiled sanctuary. The body/temple microcosm implicit in the scaly skin disease sequence - human, clothing, house - extends not only forward in Leviticus to the purification of the Tent of Meeting, but also backward to the purification of the priests. xxv" In Leviticus 8, shortly before the instructions about the person with scaly skin disease, God instructs Moses on the rites that Aaron and his sons must undergo in order to become the sacred officiants at the Tent of Meeting. Among the rites of passage that the initiates undergo, Moses applies sacrificial blood to their right earlobes, thumbs, and big toes: He slaughtered (the ram), and Moses took its blood and put it on Aaron's right earlobe, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. And he approached Aaron's sons, and Moses put the blood on their right earlobes, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. (Lev 8:23-24) The same curious rite (though with a different animal and a different type of sacrifice) occurs in the purification of the person healed of scaly skin disease: He shall slaughter the lamb of the reparation offering, and the priest shall take the blood of the reparation offering and put it on the right earlobe of person to be purified from scaly skin disease, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toes of his right foot. (Lev 14:25) The analogy of the initiate priest and the person purified from scaly skin disease is clear in the similar application of sacrificial blood to their right ears, thumbs, and big toes. Nowhere else does this curious rite recur. Just as the body and house with scaly skin disease are analogical exemplifications of the polluted Tent of Meeting, so the person being purified from scaly skin disease is an analogical exemplification of the initiate priest. Both are transformed from a state of impurity to purity in their respective rites of passage, though the priests are transformed a step further to a state of holiness. XX1X Significantly, as part of the process of purification each must remain for seven days either outside or at the threshold of a tent: 176</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 (2) 2004 Review Forum Priestly initiate "You shall dwell at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, day and night, for seven days" (Lev 8:35) Person healed of scaly of skin disease "He shall dwell outside of his tent for seven days" (Lev 14:8) Only after the seven day period of the rite of passage is the person reintegrated into society, whether the Israelite community or the priestly guild. The person purified of scaly skin disease can now dwell in his tent, among his people, just as the purified and consecrated priest can now serve at the holy Tent of Meeting with his fellow priests. The body/temple microcosm is confirmed by these ritual acts. A lacuna in the analogical ordering thus far is the position of the garment with scaly skin disease. It holds an intermediate place between human and house scaly skin disease in the literary sequence of Leviticus 13-14, but is less explicitly analogous to the situation of the Tent of Meeting or the initiate priest. I would suggest that that there is nonetheless a possible analogical relationship with Tent and priest. The garments subject to scaly skin disease are made of wool, linen, or leather (Lev 13:47-48). The garments of the initiate priests - which are sprinkled with oil and sacrificial blood in order to consecrate them (Lev 8:30) - are made of fine linen and dyed wool. The exterior "cover"of the Tent of Meeting is made of leather (Exod 26:14), and the "cover" over the entrance is made of linen and dyed wool (Exod 26:36). "™ In sum, the garments of the priests and the coverings of the Tent of Meeting are vulnerable to scaly skin disease, providing an analogy of coverings, garments, and skin. The case of garment scaly skin disease exemplifies the vulnerable "skin" of the Tent of Meeting as it does the sacred vestments of the priests. Priestly Revisionism Seen as an example of priestly analogical thought, the instructions on scaly skin disease impurity gain a greater degree of intelligibility. This is not a random class of disease - note that no other diseases are covered in the priestly instructions - but a specific set of conditions that fits into the analogical ordering of the purity laws of Leviticus. A question that arises from the analogical significance of scaly skin disease in priestly discourse is whether and to what degree this represents a break with previous concepts of this malady. Scholars have argued that it exemplifies a conceptual rupture that is foundational for the priestly purity system, but they disagree on what type of departure it represents. The priestly instructions on scaly skin disease do not trace its cause to a fault of its victim. As Milgrom observes regarding garment scaly skin disease, "The nexus between malady and sin has been severed.""™" The analogy of garment, house, and human scaly skin disease may suggest that the human malady too is independent of personal guilt or liability. This is remarkable in view of the treatment of this disease in other biblical texts and elsewhere in the ancient Near East. Karel van der Toorn describes the traditional view in Mesopotamia and Israel: Illness stands out as the traditionally most unambiguous indicator of sin .... Leprosy was felt to be a punishment from God or the gods more particularly than other ailments, necessitating the banishment of the afflicted from the palace and the temple. xxxlv In the Bible scaly skin disease is often moblized as a divine punishment in accordance with this traditional view. The following are the clearest examples (all from non-priestly texts): 1. When Miriam and Aaron complain about Moses' authority: "Yahweh was angry with them ... and behold Miriam was stricken with scaly skin disease like snow .... And Aaron said, "... we have been foolish and have sinned" (Num 12:9-1 1). 2. David curses Joab: "Let there never be lacking from Joab's house someone with genital discharge, someone with scaly skin disease, someone who holds the spindle, someone who falls by the sword, and someone who lacks bread" (2 Sam 3:29). 3. Elisha curses his unfaithful servant Gehazi: '"Let the scaly skin disease of Naaman cleave to you and to your seed forever.' And he went out from before him stricken with scaly skin disease like snow" 177</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 &lt; 2 ) 2004 Review Forum (2 Kgs 5:27). 4. King Azariah/Uzziah: "Yahweh smote the king, and he had scaly skin disease until the day of his death" (2 Kgs 15:5). (In 2 Chr 26:16-21 the fault of the king is specified as an attempt to enter the Temple to burn incense.) In each of these examples, scaly skin disease is used forensically as a punishment for a sin or crime. In each case God is involved, implicitly or explicitly, as the divine judge who dispenses the disease as punishment. Probably related is the case of Job, who is afflicted with "terrible boils from the sole of his foot to his head" (Job 2:7). In his case the term scaly skin disease is not used, but the same forensic conception is involved, since both Job and his comforters assume that he is being punished by God. To Job this punishment is unjust, since he has not sinned. But while Job questions God's justice, he never questions the causal nexus of skin disease and divine punishment. Priestly discourse in the purity laws of Leviticus appears to abandon this nexus. This is a significant departure from precedent. As Douglas observes, "no sin has caused the impurity, leprosy is not a punishment any more than a nocturnal emission [Lev 15:16] is a sin." There are other places in priestly narrative where God does dispense disease as punishment - in the Egyptian plagues (Exod 9:8- 1 1), the plague after the sin of Korah (Num 17:13-14), and the plague after the sin at Peor (Num 25:8-9) - but notably not scaly skin disease. The priestly purity laws may diverge in this respect from priestly narrative, or it may be that scaly skin disease is a special case. The situation is comparable in the case of house scaly skin disease. While there are no other examples from the Hebrew Bible, there is mention in Mesopotamian omen literature of house fungus as a sign or portent of evil. Samuel Meier comments: "The katarru- fungus is an omen which normally indicates that evil is on the horizon. If the sign can be destroyed, then the evil it points to can be short-circuited." In Mesopotamia, house fungus is a divine sign, a portent of fate and the intention of the gods. As such, it participates in the model of disease as a signifier of divine displeasure. But, as Meier notes, in Leviticus 14 "it is the fungus itself which is destructive [viz. polluting - RSH] ... no hint of the fungus being an omen." xxxvni In priestly discourse, house fungus is a source of impurity with no obvious connection to the nexus of sin and punishment. Milgrom notes that there is an implication that the condition of human scaly skin disease pollutes the sanctuary, since the person healed of scaly skin disease must offer a purification sacrifice. But this need not be a matter of the sufferer's sin, it is more likely the function of a basic principle that Milgrom enunciates: "impurity displaces an equal amount of sanctuary holiness." ^ Milgrom also notes that since the healed person must offer a reparation offering, there is a possible implication that he committed an unwitting sacrilege, even though "his disease is not traceable to sancta [trespass] or for that matter to any other cause." The significance of the reparation offering is unclear in this context. Although it may acknowledge the possibility of inadvertent sin, it seems that the priestly system has effaced, or at least radically attenuated, the earlier forensic model which highlights scaly skin disease as a punishment for sin. Milgrom attributes the decoupling of the priestly rites from the model of sin and punishment to a symbolic reinterpretation motivated by a priestly aversion to pagan demonology: "In large measure, the priests succeeded in excising, and failing that in blunting, the most blatant pagan elements of the rite." It is, Milgrom argues, a rejection of "demonic impurity," viz., the idea that demons cause impurity. This may be true in other instances of impurity, but in the above cited biblical examples of scaly skin disease, it is not demons who afflict scaly skin disease, but God. The priestly break is not from foreign or demonic models of disease, but from traditional Israelite and Yahwistic understandings. The priestly break or reinterpretation of earlier concepts of scaly skin disease and the nexus of disease and sin is plausibly connected to a wider trait in priestly thought that Baruch Halpem has called "the elite redefinition of traditional culture." The innovations in priestly thought are, in many cases, revisions of the practices and beliefs of earlier Israelite culture. Halpern lists briefly some of the Priestly reforms: P set out to correct the distortions in anthropomorphism and distributed sacrifice found in the old national literature. He even provided a new, central shrine of the collective ancestors, the patriarchs, suppl [anting] the place of the old clan section shrines. P rewrote the folk history of JE, suppressing all mention of angels... As mere representations, epiphenomena of the One, the gods and nature were alienated from Yhwh and 178</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 12) 2004 Review Forum identified as alien, as against the old theology, which lived comfortably with their stewardship of other nations in subordination to Yhwh. xlv"' In a striking example of Priestly revisionism, the "heavenly host" - formerly the lesser divinities of Yahweh's heavenly entourage - becomes in the priestly creation account a term for inert nature: "Thus were completed heaven and earth and all their host (Gen 2:1). ^1* The lesser gods are naturalized, nature is depersonalized, and God is de-anthropomorphized. The structures of traditional religion are loosened and recast, "rationalized" in Weber's sense. 1 The uncoupling of scaly skin disease from the traditional model of malady and divine punishment is part of a wider reformulation in priestly thought of the relationship between God and humankind. God is more transcendent, religion less anthropocentric. The concept of scaly skin disease is shorn of its forensic import and is now a type of what David Wright calls "tolerated impurity." 11 Victims of this condition are not guilty of sin, they are merely susceptible to impurity, as is every Israelite. As Wright observes, "impure conditions are so numerous and natural that such debility is taken for granted and made part of the system."1" Disease becomes something like a natural condition rather than a supernatural consequence. In priestly thought it is not demons that are exorcised, but rather a degree of the "enchantment of the world." According to this implication of the priestly system, divine punishment is no longer the necessary cause of human malady. m' Conclusion: Priestly Silences Priestly thought is dense and obscure. It does not explain. Mary Douglas astutely connects the silence of the priests with their highly structured social context and their analogical mode of thought. In such conditions, sometimes silence is more powerful than speech.... Meaning depends on shared knowledge about the logical relations of objects in time and space. Meanings are not carried primarily through verbal channels, but conveyed obliquely by reference to established analogies. Uv Priestly discourse, ordered by analogical relations among its parts, is a densely textured "science of the concrete," to use Lévi-Strauss' term.lv The place of the analogical sequence of human, garment, and house scaly skin disease is as a set of signifiers in a larger analogical discourse about pollution and purification, whose focal points are the priest and the house of God, both of which are holy and vulnerable, and whose ritual interaction sustains the cosmic order. Milgrom argues that the prominence of scaly skin disease in the priestly purity system has to do with its symbolic function as a signifier of death. The main clue for understanding the place of scaly skin disease in the impurity system is the fact that it is an aspect of death: its bearer is treated like a corpse. This equation is expressly stated by Aaron in his prayer on behalf of Miriam when she is stricken with scaly skin disease: "Let her not be like a corpse" (Num 12:12) lvl He suggests that "the wasting of the body, the common characteristic of all biblically impure skin diseases, symbolizes the death process,"1™ and that "the purificatory rites for scale-diseased and corpse- contaminated persons ... symbolize the victory of the forces of life over death."1™1 In this view, the priestly purity system is situated between the opposition of life and death and resolves it - at a theological and performative level - in its effective rites. lix I would qualify Milgrom's view by noting that life and death are themselves symbolic operators in biblical thought. As Johannes Pedersen acutely observed, life and death in biblical discourse often refer to poles or phases in a continuum: Life and death are not two sharply distinguished spheres, because they do not mean existence or non- existence. Life is something which one possesses in a higher or lower degree. If afflicted by misfortune, illness or something else which checks the soul, then one has only little life, but all the more death. He who is ill or otherwise in distress may say that he is dead, and when he recovers, he is pulled out of death. ,x 179</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 (2) 2004 Review Forum A case in point is the person with scaly skin disease, who is banished from the community and must engage in rites of mourning (Lev 13:45-46). This person is in a state of social death, cut off from human society and from the ritually available presence of God. lM "All the days the disease is on him, he shall be unclean - he is unclean. Alone he shall dwell, his dwelling shall be outside the camp" (Lev 13:46). His solitude, his ritual state of mourning, his marred appearance, and his cry, "Impure, impure" provide a vivid portrait of Dorian Gray, of the symbolic death that is the negative correlate of the priest officiating at the holy of holies. The person with scaly skin disease is not only the inverse of the sanctified priest, but his condition of exile and social death is a symbolic correlate of the outcome should the delicate balances of the priestly purity system collapse. tól Moreover, the condition of scaly skin disease is not entirely "an aspect of death," for it can be healed and purified, and one can return from it. It is certainly death-like in some respects, condemning its victim to a pitiful existence outside the vital world of the living. But it is ambiguous in that it is reversable, and the purified victims - unlike the dead - can return to their tents. The condition of scaly skin disease is therefore ambiguous with respect to the opposition of life and death, since it can be resolved either way. It is therefore an apt symbolic operator or mediating term between life and death. In some respects scaly skin disease is like the condition of sin - it can destroy, or it can be cured and purified. The dangerous effects of sin on God's Tent are, I have argued, correlated with scaly skin disease in the analogical structures of priestly discourse. Sin and scaly skin disease mediate between life and death, between impurity and holiness, since they change the status of persons and tents between these crucial domains. And for both, to restore the fullness of life requires the interventions of priestly ritual. While the subtle valences of life and death, and the correlated states of holiness and impurity, are certainly basic to priestly thought, they are not the only motivations. Douglas argues that purity laws in most cultures have social impact as instruments of power: [W]here lines of abominability are drawn heavy stakes are at issue. The classification of the universe is part and parcel of social organization, and the categories are useful in defining who can be admitted where, and who comes first and who comes second or nowhere at all. The conceptual categories of priestly thought should have practical and political ramifications, and not be simply a play of abstractions. She observes that the purity system "applies well enough, in fairly obvious ways, for the cult of the tabernacle and the dignity of the priesthood .... [and] draw[s] a boundary round the people of Israel against outsiders." |X1V She further suggests that a salient social function of the priestly purity laws may have been to eliminate or reduce the force of impurity accusations: Ritual contagion, usually a punishing accusation, has been defanged, its claws are drawn, it is rendered helpless for defence or attack. The systematization of sin in Leviticus makes all human creatures unavoidably liable to defilement .... In the priestly books uncleanness is a sacred contagion whose conditions are independent of intention. ^ This is a plausible social motive - the reduction of social strife by neutralizing accusations of pollution - and may be related to the broader reformulations of traditional culture in priestly thought. The traditional view would be that represented in the psalms of lament and in Job, where the victim's friends and enemies alike condemn the victim as morally culpable and either abandon or attack him.lxvi In the priestly system impurity is not a term of moral condemnation, but a condition of human existence. Yet even as impurity is to some degree universalized and defanged, the priestly system reserves for itself the political power implicit in accusations (or diagnoses) of impurity. According to the priestly rules, ordinary Israelites cannot marshal effective impurity accusations, but priests can. The story of King Uzziah (2 Chron 26:16-21), removed from kingship by priestly diagnosis of scaly skin disease, is a case in point. Ix™ An egalitarian doctrine of impurity is qualified by a priestly monopoly over its social power. |XV1" The priestly writings are silent on the rationale for the purity laws. In the foregoing I have tried to draw closer to their rationale by extending Mary Douglas' study of analogical thought in Leviticus to the details of the priestly instructions on scaly skin disease and the analogical networks that sustain and channel their meanings. Douglas argues that "microcosmic thinking uses analogies as a logical basis for a total metaphysical framework. The priestly discourses on scaly skin disease, in this respect, provide an entry into priestly metaphysics. The purity laws are sustained not by persuasion or argument, but by the 180</page><page sequence="10">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 (2) 2004 Review Forum subtle linkages among such concrete things as bodies, garments, houses, priests, and the Tent of Meeting where God's presence rests.
