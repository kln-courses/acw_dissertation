On the basis of case studies of twenty-five surveys of museum visitors and performing-arts audiences , the authors describe the purposes , applications, and general impact of small-scale applied social research , note similarities to and divergences from the federal experience, and suggest explanations based on organizational theory. A X JLccording to a once-conventional viewpoint, applied social re- search contributes to a policy process by giving decision makers the specific information they need to solve focused problems rationally. This view of a restricted but unproblematic application of research was shaped by a traditional paradigm presupposing the existence of a system of rational, goal-directed actors. Individuals face problems of ensuring their own welfare; they clarify alternatives, obtain in- formation necessary for informed choice, and then use the informa- tion gathered to choose the alternative that will yield the best out- come. The anthropomorphic problem-solving model assumed that private organizations and public agencies also act purposefully and arrive at optimal solutions to their policy problems by seeking out We are grateful to Paula Brown and Jane Gallup for research assistance, to the National Endowment for the Arts for research support, to Michael Garet for helpful comments on an earlier draft, and to the Center for the Study of Public Policy for institutional support.

Investigators examining the use of federally sponsored applied research in areas as diverse as education, health care, and communications policy have concluded that, in general, "most research studies bounce off the policy process without making much of a dent on the course of events."3 To the extent that the research does affect policy, it does 1. The problem-solving model is described by Carol H. Weiss in "Re- search for Policy's Sake: The Enlightenment Function of Social Research," Policy Analysis 3 (1977): 118. Her definition is similar to that of David Cohen and Michael Garet, "Reforming Educational Policy With Applied Social Research," Harvard Educational Review 45 (1975): 17-41; and of Martin Rein and Sheldon H. White, "Policy Research: Belief and Doubt," Policy Analysis 3 (1977): 239-71. The problem-solving model is related to what John Steinbruner has called "the analytic paradigm" ( The Cybernetic Theory of Decision : New Dimensions of Political Analysis [Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1974], pp. 25-35). Such models rest on a belief in procedural rationality, behavior being seen as rational "insofar as it is purposefully directed toward explicit empirical objectives and planned in accordance with the best available scientific knowledge" (Stanley H. Udy, Jr., "Administrative Rationality, Social Setting, and Organizational Develop- ment," in A Sociological Reader on Complex Organizations , 2d ed., ed., Amitai Etzioni [New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1969]). 2.

Research results are seen as weapons in political struggles.5 The research process has been identified alternatively as a tool for problem-setting and as a tactic for delay and cooptation.6 And the research enterprise itself has been characterized as a form of social discourse or, at best, as an agency of general enlightenment.7 What these diverse diagnoses share is a rejection of the notion that research yields solutions to specific problems and that research enters the policy process in a manner characterized by procedural rationality. Analysts of the impact of applied research on decision making have thus far largely restricted their attention to the use of research by a single type of organization - the government agency, partic- ularly at the federal level. Yet the use of applied research has not been monopolized by the federal government. Other types of or- ganizations, including many small nonprofit institutions, increas- ingly conduct or commission their own research, and many turn to social scientists. If this small-scale applied research is neither so visible nor so well funded as research at the federal level, it may, ultimately, be equally significant. It is tempting to assume that lessons derived from the federal ex- perience are directly applicable to the small-scale research situation. Yet to do so without empirical verification would be an error. Re- search on organizations has amply demonstrated that decision- making processes are influenced by such factors as organizational size and structure and environmental constraints. Thus the role of research findings in the deliberations of organizations that are, for the most part, smaller, more autonomous, and poorer in resources and in information than federal agencies may well differ in impor- 4.

On the one hand, we might surmise that the relative inexperience and, in some cases, less strict adherence to bureaucratic norms of smaller nonprofit organ- izations would lead to even greater deviation from the problem- solving model. On the other hand, the existence of fewer hierar- chical levels and the greater autonomy of many of these organiza- tions might permit a flexibility that would lead to a more direct application of research results in decisionmaking.8 The purpose of this paper is to consider the use of applied social research by one set of relatively small organizations in a decentral- ized field, that of the arts. On the basis of case studies of twenty-five such research projects, we describe the purpose for which research is undertaken, the uses made of research findings, and the impact of the research as a whole on the organizations that undertake it. Finally, with these findings in mind, we consider the ways in which the organizational context of applied social research influences its execution and implementation. In particular, drawing on the work of Michael Cohen and James G. March, we suggest that despite im- portant similarities, small-scale applied research plays a somewhat different role in organizational decision-making than the federal experience would suggest.9 AUDIENCE RESEARCH: THE BACKGROUND OF THE ANALYSIS One major set of users of small-scale applied research consists of arts organizations - museums, performing-arts organizations, and local arts councils. Much of their research concerns the composition, behavior, and attitudes of arts audiences. Typically, samples of visitors or attendere are asked for information on topics ranging 8. The effects of an organization's environment on its decision-making process have been investigated from a variety of perspectives. See, for ex- ample, Tom Burns and G. M. Stalker, The Management of Innovation (Lon- don: Tavistock, 1961); Paul Lawrence and Jay Lorsch, Organization and Environment (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University, Graduate School of Business Administration, 1967); James D.

Art audience studies also include crosssectional surveys of local popula- tions designed to acquire information on respondents' exposure to and attitudes towards the arts. Most of the studies employ tradi- tional survey techniques, although some use quasi-experimental de- signs. Such research has ostensibly been undertaken by arts man- agers and policymakers to determine the composition of the public that particular arts organizations serve, provide information for market-expansion efforts, estimate the local economic impact of spending associated with attendance at arts events, inform decisions on prices and hours, and evaluate public sentiment towards the arts. While such studies constitute a fugitive literature - only a tiny proportion of the studies yield published results - the frequency with which they have been carried out is great indeed. Of more than six hundred arts organizations responding to one inquiry, 33 per- cent had conducted audience studies within the previous five years.10 Of 612 arts organizations responding to our own survey, 27 percent had undertaken such studies in recent memory and many others were preparing to do so.11 The extensiveness of audience research, which appears to be a relatively recent development, is a response to changes in the environment of arts organizations. First, the in- creasing importance to those organizations of governmental funding has heightened concern about the public served. Second, the in- creasing rationalization and professionalization of arts administra- tion in response to expansion and financial privation has intensified management's interest in the arts constituency and potential market. While audience research is often shoddy, sometimes perfunctory, and not yet an established part of arts governance, such research is widespread and provides an opportunity to investigate the use of applied research in settings far different from those already studied. The research performed and commissioned by arts organizations is not "policy research" in the ordinary sense. In nearly every case, 10. See Alton C. Johnson, and E. Arthur Prieve, Older Americans: The Unrealized Audience for the Arts (Madison: Center for Arts Administration 1976). 11. See Paul DiMaggio, Micnael useem, and Paula Brown, Audience Studies of Museums and the Performing Arts: A Critical Review (Washing- ton, D.C.: National Endowment for the Arts, 1978).</page><page sequence="6">192 POLICY ANALYSIS the impetus behind such research is more diffuse and less ambitious than the term policy research suggests. Nonetheless, in the arts these small-scale studies have been, up to now, the most important form of policy research. This is so because the artistic field lacks the kind of central coordination that generates a visible policy enterprise. Solutions to the most crucial issues of arts policy - the relationship of cultural institutions to the public, the importance of planning, the kinds of products deemed legitimate art - are developed as the aggregate of many decisions by local organizations. Some decisions into which research findings enter - for example, whether or not to place benches in art galleries to oombat visitor fatigue, or whether to market symphony tickets to individuals who demographically re- semble current attenders rather than to groups presently underrep- resented in audiences - are decidely mundane. Yet such decisions may provide the most important occasions for the airing of more profound policy issues, and it is out of such choices that arts policy is wrought.12 Technical Quality and Degree of Utilization The research described here was instigated by the paradoxical re- sults of another analysis, reported elsewhere, of a set of eighty-six audience studies.13 In that analysis, we were concerned with the factors that predict a study's technical quality and with the extent to which a study's technical quality would influence the likelihood of the study being used. Research that is carefully designed and ex- ecuted should provide a better basis for decision than research that is not, since it yields information that is more accurate and therefore more appropriate for decision makers' needs.14 12. In the past four years the National Endowment for the Arts has turned its attention to planning and policy, its research division has begun to com- mission more conventional policy research, and some independent policy analysts have turned their attention to the arts. This activity, however, is still in a very early stage. At present, the arts policymaking process is still characterized by an extreme form of what Charles Lindblom has character- ized as "disjointed incrementalism." See David Braybrooke and Charles E. Lindblom, A Strategy of Decision: Policy Evaluation as a Social Process (New York: Free Press, 1970), chs. 4 and 5. 13.

Other studies have indicated that the quality of evaluation research</page><page sequence="7">SMALL-SCALE POLICY RESEARCH IN THE ARTS 193 We found it possible to predict the technical quality of a study with considerable precision once the budget and study director's profession were known. To measure the study's usefulness, we asked the directors to rate the utility of their research in nine different managerial and policy areas, ranging from the selection of exhibits or works for performance to designing development programs, pro- moting public relations, and maintaining the support of funding sources. We discovered virtually no relation between the technical quality of a study and its degree of utilization. Study directors rated some studies as very useful and other studies as much less valuable. Technical quality varied widely from study to study, yet technical quality bore no relationship to reported utility. Twenty-five Case Studies To better understand this puzzling finding, we intensively ex- amined the ways in which twenty-five of the eighty-six audience studies were applied to the decisions of arts organizations. The re- sults of this analysis are reported here. In each instance, we at- tempted to interview both the study director and the person most likely to have been in an organizational position to utilize the re- search results. (In eight cases, either the study director was the key user or interviews with only one of the two principals could be ar- ranged.) We completed forty-two semistructured interviews, aver- aging forty minutes in length and ranging from twenty to ninety minutes. For additional background material, we conducted un- structured interviews with twenty-five other individuals who had commissioned, directed, or attempted to use the results of audience research. The case studies included all audience studies in our possession that had been conducted between 1974 and 1977 in the New Eng- land and Middle Atlantic regions.15 The studies ran the gamut of affects the conclusions reached.

Some were attempts to assess the economic im- pact of an art form on an urban economy. Some involved questions related to planning, broadly defined. Others sought information oriented toward marketing problems. Still others evaluated museum- exhibit effectiveness. The studies included surveys of visitors to and audiences for six art museums, one science museum, five theaters, two classical-music organizations, one opera, one ballet, and one organization presenting several kinds of performances. Two local cross-sectional surveys assessed public attitudes toward participa- tion in the arts, and two studies covered audiences for most or all of a city's cultural organizations. Of the twenty-five studies, four were carried out by consulting firms, ten by academics (often work- ing closely with managers), four by university students, and seven by arts-organization staff members. Studies ranged in cost from under a hundred dollars to more than ten thousand dollars. The or- ganizations studied varied in size from several of the nation's lead- ing performing-arts organizations to relatively small museums in small cities and performing-arts organizations with extremely mod- est attendance and budgets. Our interviews suggested that the problem-solving model of re- search utilization provides a poor guide to what really happens when arts organizations sponsor audience studies. Despite the range of audiences surveyed and types of studies represented, the researchers and arts managers with whom we spoke portrayed a remarkably similar process and one that deviated sharply from the conventional norm. Their accounts explain the lack of connection between the technical quality of research and its utility, and also suggest some ways in which locally oriented research differs from that sponsored and used at the federal level. THE REASONS FOR AUDIENCE RESEARCH According to the problem-solving model of decision making, re- newsletters, we were able to acquire 268 audience studies conducted since 1960. The twenty-five studies that are the focus of the present inquiry are drawn from among these. Only post-1973 studies were included, to ensure that respondent recollections were relatively fresh; the regional restriction was imposed to minimize data-collections costs. Since these restrictions re- sulted in the exclusion of all examples of several major types of studies, the geographic restriction was relaxed to include five midwestern studies, in order to represent all types of audience studies among the case studies. For further details, see DiMaggio, Useem, and Brown, Audience Studies.</page><page sequence="9">SMALL-SCALE POLICY RESEARCH IN THE ARTS 195 search is undertaken when organizations or governments need in- formation upon which to base relatively focused decisions. In con- trast to this model, not one of the twenty-five studies about which we interviewed organizational directors and/ or users was under- taken primarily to gather information necessary to influence a specific managerial decision. Instead, they were instigated by such factors as the need for political leverage, the appearance of an un- expected opportunity to have a cost-free study conducted, and a variety of diffuse concerns only indirectly related to specific de- cisions. Political Factors Politics was the most frequently mentioned major reason for undertaking an audience study (ten of the twenty-five studies). Po- litical purposes included acquiring evidence useful in seeking funds, gaining leverage in internal policy debates, and appeasing members of an organization's board of directors or other influential persons. The initiation of research for the sake of seeking outside subsidy is illustrated in the case of one study undertaken to document public support for a new performing-arts facility. The study's director de- scribed its purpose: "A committee [of bankers and businessmen] set about to raise money to get [the local government] to take over the theater for the county once it was renovated. The study was a spinoff of that effort. ... It was done to prove that there was a market and to gain additional support to get the county to approve and accept a building." In another instance, an economic-impact study was performed to illustrate the importance of a beleaguered theater district to an ur- ban economy. The city was ready to act and "the research had clout because it documented the obvious." In yet another case, a cross- sectional survey was commissioned by a municipal government to document an existing arts council's failure to meet local art needs. The survey results contributed to the resignation of the old council and the creation of a new one. One arts council conducted a study essentially for the purpose of announcing its presence and increas- ing its scope of operations. Other audience research was commissioned for use in internal debate. Individuals needed additional ammunition for their posi- tions and were confident that a research study would support their cause. Although the study's instigator may have been open to per-</page><page sequence="10">196 POUCY ANALYSIS suasion, the primary motive was to compile support for a position rather than to resolve an issue. One theater manager, for instance, in explaining his reasons for surveying the audience of a summer drama festival immediately after becoming manager, stated, "In the summer, [the theater] did seven shows in rolling rep, which I think is insane itself, and [the theater was] doing about 50 percent busi- ness. ... I had the feeling that [the theater] should be delivering a more popular product, and the survey helped document this." Being new to the job, this experienced arts manager needed to demonstrate the value of an alternative policy before instituting a controversial change, and he (correctly) anticipated that a survey would support his own preference for more popular fare. Similarly, a new director for a rather traditional museum saw in a wide-ranging membership study a fulcrum for the change of several traditional practices. One museum surveyed visitors for evidence to combat pressure to insti- tute an admission fee, while another arts facility made a survey to justify the institution of an admission fee to a skeptical state funding agency. Audience studies are occasionally done in response to pressure from influential membership committees or members of boards of directors. One study of a performing-arts institution, for instance, was undertaken because of a membership committee's concern with what it perceived as an overly "elite" audience. The study's findings, however, were largely ignored by management; the study's purpose was pacification, not illumination. This was also the case for another study initiated at the behest of a chairperson of a museum's member- ship committee. The administration of the museum regarded the survey questionnaire as "silly," and the disappointed study director concluded that her study "was just an exercise. ... I didn't know who to tell the results to or who would listen to me." Opportunity The second most commonly reported general motivation for undertaking audience research was the appearance of an unexpected and relatively cost-free opportunity. This was a principal consider- ation in eight of the twenty-five cases we examined. Arts managers often take advantage of such occasions for inexpensive research to satisfy a kind of free-floating curiosity. Volunteer labor, the avail- ability of outside funding, or both were usually the catalyst. In one</page><page sequence="11">SMALL-SCALE POLICY RESEARCH IN THE ARTS 197 instance, museum administrators were in the process of preparing a grant application for federal funds. The museum was almost certain to receive the grant, and at the last minute an affiliated researcher revised the proposal to include a visitor survey. Similarly, when questioned about the timing of a visitor study at his museum, an- other director said, "Simply, funds became available. ... [A federal agency] made funding available for the purpose so [the museum] used the occasion to do a study." Volunteer outside labor was the motivating factor in other instances. In one case, a country-wide attenders/nonattenders study was included in a larger audience- development program only after a university professor stepped for- ward, suggested the study, and promised to design the questionnaire and provide student labor. A theater study was undertaken when a business school student with an outside grant took it on as a summer job. The initiative for such studies often rested with a single indi- vidual prepared to take advantage of an opportune situation. One researcher, hired as a consultant for overall planning, defined his role to include carrying out a visitor study. The museum managers "didn't so much want the study done as they, kicking and screaming, grudgingly allowed me to do it." General Concerns The third major reason for undertaking audience research, prin- cipally cited in six of the twenty-five studies, is a nagging sense of concern, a vague feeling on the part of managers that they are work- ing in a knowledge vacuum and that certain kinds of background information, usually not clearly specified, would be valuable. In several cases, for instance, museums were about to undertake long- range physical planning and felt that they needed "some input" from visitors or wanted "to get some idea about the audience." One outside researcher complained that a museum representative ap- proached him with "vague, vacuous questions." Another said of an arts-council client, "They vaguely suggested doing a survey of gen- eral goals." A museum director spoke of the difficulty he had in fixing goals for a study of his visitors, and an in-house research di- rector for a performing arts institution described his study as a "first feeble attempt at research. . . . Some of it was stabbing in the dark." Such studies were inspired by a genuine desire to learn more, an acknowledgement of the importance of audience opinion, and a sense</page><page sequence="12">198 POUCY ANALYSIS that so little was known that any gain in knowledge would be worth- while. APPLICATIONS OF AUDIENCE STUDIES Despite the variety of reasons for which these studies were un- dertaken, and the wide range of quality once they were completed, most arts managers did use their results extensively, if often in- directly or marginally. Participants in all but two of the twenty-five studies mentioned at least one example of study impact, and multi- ple usages were cited in many cases. Of seventy-seven applications described, fifty-one (or 66 percent) were broadly instrumental - re- lated to such specific organizational decisions as physical planning, marketing, programming, or further research. Twenty-six instances (34 percent) were basically political - related to either internal politics or external lobbying and fundraising. Instrumental usage was made of twenty of the twenty-five studies, while political appli- cation was made of eighteen (see table 1). Instrumental applications Table 1.

Instrumental Applications The most frequently mentioned use of audience research was for the instrumental area of physical planning, cited for fourteen of the studies and representing 29 percent of all instances of application. In nearly half of the cases, research findings were inputs into de-</page><page sequence="13">SMALL-SCALE POLICY RESEARCH IN THE ARTS 199 cisions involving the orientation of museum visitors (signs, infor- mation desks, guide training, brochures) or the institution of at- tender conveniences (special bus services, restaurant facilities, roadway markings, cleaner washrooms). Audience research was also cited as influencing decisions about ticket and admission prices, performance times and museum hours, exhibit labelling and design, exhibit-acquisitions policies, and performance sites. More generally, studies were said to have an indirect influence on architectural plan- ning and to increase staff concern with visitor orientation. Marketing was the second most important area of instrumental applications. Input into marketing decisions was cited for twelve studies and represented 20 percent of all cases of utility. Audience research provided input into decisions to change the target of mar- keting efforts and to change the themes of promotional materials. More generally, studies were also given credit for stimulating in- stitutional thinking about audience composition, marketing, and audience development. Surprisingly, the directors and users reported that 12 percent of the study applications were in the instrumental area of research it- self. Six studies were used to encourage research beyond the insti- tution sponsoring the study; three studies aroused enthusiasm for further research within the same organization. Finally, 6 percent of the applications were for the instrumental purpose of programming. Study results had a direct effect on programming choices or re- oriented administrators' thinking about programming. Political Applications Internal political consequences were cited for fourteen of the twenty-five studies, representing 22 percent of all uses mentioned. Such political uses included increasing trustee interest, selling ad- ministrators on the value of marketing, aiding the reorganization of a local arts council, providing leverage with parental or affiliated organizations, sparking the withdrawal of some members to form new institutions, and making curators more secure in their positions. Of the application areas described here, internal political uses were the most often unexpected and the least explicit at the time the study was conceived. Use in external political areas was mentioned for nine of the studies and represented 12 percent of all instances cited. Audience- research results were used to seek funding from municipal and state</page><page sequence="14">200 POLICY ANALYSIS governments and from private individuals and concerns. No inter- viewees indicated that the results were useful in approaching the federal government. THE ROLE OF THE RESEARCH PROCESS IN ARTS MANAGEMENT For whatever reason it is undertaken, audience research obvi- ously has payoffs for arts organizations in a wide range of substan- tive areas. The relative frequency of instrumental applications may even seem to confirm the problem-solving model. This interpreta- tion is illusory. Even research that is frightfully poor by orthodox standards of social science inquiry has played a useful role in the deliberations of arts managers. This finding does not accord with the conventional view that research is most powerful when it is most sophisticated, and that good research, designed to address specific problems, is used to make specific decisions about these problems. While the problem-solving model may characterize aspects of a few of the studies, we have seen that much audience research is highly variable in quality, is rarely designed with specific decisions in mind, yet is reported as being highly useful. This could reflect a lack of research and managerial sophistication among arts administrators, but we think not. Rather, just as research is not undertaken for the purposes commonly supposed, research findings, even when put to instrumental use, do not play the role in rational decision making that the problem-solving model attributes to them. Instead of serv- ing as the basis for decisions, study findings act as catalysts or props; they function more as utensils for decision makers than as deter- minants of action. To understand how audience research is applied, let us look more closely at the ways in which study findings affected arts management among the cases we examined. Marginal Impact The impact of research findings on arts management is invariably marginal. This is true in several senses. First, arts managers usually have at least some administrative experience, are often aware of the limitations of research, and rely on their own experience and judg- ment to assess research conclusions. Research findings are used, but they are used in the context of a complex background of previously acquired knowledge and beliefs.16 For instance, a performing-arts 16. See Cohen and Garet, "Reforming Educational Policy," for similar observations at the federal level.</page><page sequence="15">SMALL-SCALE POLICY RESEARCH IN THE ARTS 201 manager cited an audience study - the technical limitations of which he fully understood - as influencing his decision to change promotional strategies for a series of public performances: "It helped us refocus our promotional efforts in the [outdoor drama series] . I'm not totally trustful of the results, but they did show a large number of people heard about the concerts in the community newspapers, which we hadn't expected, and even if it's only half as large as the survey indicated, it is very economical advertising. We're putting more money into the neighborhood press." Studies frequently serve to reinforce preferences already held or decisions already favored. The results of one study, said a theater manager, "followed exactly what my gut was saying. I just wanted to be sure I was right." Conversely, when research results contradict strongly held positions or views, they are likely to be ignored, de- spite high technical quality and clearcut policy implications. Thus, one well-executed museum visitor study had virtually no impact, even though it contained implications for museum design and visitor orientation. One in-house supporter of the study recounted, [The museum staffers] were skeptical, first because they could not believe that [the research director] knew more about the public than they did, and second because they did not feel that knowing about the public had anything to do with how the galleries should be han- dled. . . . The major criticism of [the research director] was that he was an outsider who lacked a depth of knowledge based on years of experience. He was not criticized on any specifically methodological grounds; his critics didn't know what methodology was. In some instances, studies provided material for those on all sides of a debate. One somewhat cynical research veteran observed of another museum study, "I'm a bit jaundiced against this study, I have to say. People have pulled out of it what they wanted. They picked and chose what they needed to support their position." A second sense in which audience studies are marginal is that de- cisions into which they enter usually involve competing priorities. Even when participants take the accuracy of findings for granted and agree on the implications, differences in values strongly affect their willingness to implement the findings. In one typical instance, attendere of a performing-arts institution were found to prefer strongly an earlier curtain time, but action on this finding was thwarted by the need for a tight rehearsal schedule. Similarly, many</page><page sequence="16">202 POLICY ANALYSIS museum directors and curators we interviewed balanced the impli- cations of visitor-research findings against their commitment to museum functions other than responding to visitor needs. One mu- seum director put it this way: "My chief purpose is to preserve the collection; my secondary purpose is to offer programs and services which will maintain public support." Indeed, our interviewees cited many instances of administrative or curatorial resistance to research implications that were perceived as implicitly "populist." Thus re- search frequently confronts vested interests, making direct applica- tion problematic. As one director of a performing-arts audience study put it, "in general, data step on toes." Audience research findings are also marginal because they are often relevant to marginal problems. Most arts organizations have limited funds and are understaffed. Even relatively limited programs may be difficult to implement. One performing-arts manager favored a marketing strategy suggested by one study (to arrange a dinner package with a neighboring hotel), but noted that the "hand-to- mouth" existence of his organization precluded arranging for even such a minimal innovation. Similarly, several individuals in arts councils felt that other demands on their time had prevented them from fully disseminating the results of audience studies they had undertaken. And one performing-arts festival director said the pre- carious economic existence of his organization accounted for his in- ability to utilize research results: "One of the restraints on the im- plementation of new policy was that the festival is just so poor." Indirect Impact If research results play a largely marginal role in managerial policymaking, their impact is also highly indirect. Findings and im- plications are not straightforwardly translated into decisions; rather, research contributes in circuitous, often unexpected, ways to the policy process. In many cases, the studies are used less to suggest solutions to problems than to catalyze action on a burning issue or to symbolize a point of view: "I think that the survey results basically, gave us a data base to support many of the things we had an inclination about already. . . . But there was nothing cataclysmically different from what we had expected. It simply gave us a statistical base from which to work." In one museum where a study of exhibit labelling</page><page sequence="17">SMALL-SCALE POLICY RESEARCH IN THE ARTS 203 was undertaken, the specific findings and recommendations have been largely ignored, but staff people arguing for more-detailed labels often allude to the study to bolster their position. In other cases, directors or users mentioned that study findings found application but could not assess the finding's relative weight in the decision-making process - which again suggests that the effects were largely intangible. One sponsor of an internally man- aged public-opinion poll, the results of which were used in a suc- cessful lobbying effort, said of the study at one point, "It was def- inately effective in our case and at our level of government." Several moments later, however, he reflected, "It is hard to attribute any- thing directly to the report. . . . Much of what was found was very obvious, but they never [had done] anything about it. . . . They needed some kind of incentive." Again, the effect was more cata- lytic than decisive. In several other instances, staff members of arts organizations assumed the role of champions of a survey, using it repeatedly in arguments over issues involving the public. In these cases, data was brought to bear in the decision-making process, but its use was largely symbolic, representing more generalized commitments to such principles as service, better visitor orientation, or the value of marketing. In these cases the research was simply part of a much broader process of discourse and contention over organizational values and aims. The research process itself is at times as influential as the study findings. An audience study can serve to focus attention on certain aspects of an art organization's management or environment. One researcher felt that a report of his study of museum labelling was almost completely ignored, but noted that a "number of the staff had never thought about the issues I was raising, and my comments seemed to open their eyes." In another museum study, both the museum director and the researcher felt the study had heightened sensitivity to visitor concerns. The researcher observed, I think it has made a general difference in how people see things. There is not yet a radical enough effect. . . . But the idea of the questionnaire has been accepted. That goes on a lot now, whenever there is any controversy or question to be solved, people circulate questionnaires to get visitor opinions. The idea of feedback from visitors has become more important. Even going out on the floor and</page><page sequence="18">204 POLICY ANALYSIS observing and talking to people has become more important. Hie basic change is the idea that you can't sit behind closed doors and predict visitor reaction, you have to go and find it out. One of the most important indirect applications of audience studies was not in solving problems but in finding them. Rational decision-making theory would suggest that organizations monitor their environments, note problems as they arise, and made decisions accordingly. Research is generally seen as a part of the decision process, undertaken to fill gaps in information needed to make rational judgments on existing or future programs. More often, however, research appeared to help organizations scan their en- vironment, to define problem areas where at most only vague con- cerns existed.17 Museum visitor studies were particularly useful in this respect. Studies of visitors to several museums led to numerous, easily accomplished changes. Floors were renumbered, new signs posted, information desks installed. Several performing-arts institu- tions found that attenders preferred different performance times, and curtain times were changed. Surveys revealing audience social composition sometimes led to greater publicity among overrepre- sented groups, at other times to publicity among underrepresented groups. In some cases, statistical findings were less influential than handwritten comments elicited at the end of survey questionnaires. Critical assessments of physical plants were described as partic- ularly useful, since organizations could readily respond to many of the recommendations. The importance of the problem-signalling function of audience studies provides a clue to the lack of relation- ship between technical quality and utility. Information need not be precise to place an item on an organization's agenda. Seen this way, the absence of association between a study's tech- nical quality and reported usefulness is less surprising. Rather than helping managers make specific decisions, the audience studies we assessed usually served to reinforce opinions, persuade outsiders, or focus attention on some general problem area or set of goals. The contribution of research to the managerial process appears to be suggestive or symbolic rather than definitive. When this is the case, research carried out poorly can be as effective as research that is well designed and executed by orthodox standards. Not surprisingly 17. On the problem-finding function at the federal level, see Rein and White, "Belief and Doubt."</page><page sequence="19">SMALL-SCALE POLICY RESEARCH IN THE ARTS 205 then, the linkage between technical quality and research utility is a tenuous one. Even in those relatively few cases where research was brought to bear on relatively specific questions, management often had so little information that any input, however rough, could re- duce ambiguity and clarify alternatives. THE ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT OF SMALL-SCALE POLICY RESEARCH The experiences of individuals involved in applied audience re- search for arts organizations have several themes in common, some of which are familiar to students of the use of applied research at the national level. This kind of small-scale research is often used tactically, for example, as a political weapon in the conflict within and between organizations.18 Research is used to delay decisions and to appease influential people. It is commissioned to bolster the positions of managers and to lend their actions legitimacy; and the same research may be used in different ways by different sides in a struggle. Small-scale policy research is also a form of discourse and dia- logue, dealing with values and priorities as well as facts.19 Research studies are used in decision making as symbolic reference points, as indirect and marginal inputs into complex choices. Often the re- search process itself is more fateful than any specific findings, inas- much as it places large issues on an organization's agenda and im- plies a rationally oriented and thus, for most arts organizations, new way of dealing with planning and the public. Our discussions with directors and users of arts research also highlighted factors specifically related to the nature of small-scale research and of the organizations within which it is undertaken. Other analysts have identified several organizational characteristics that can help explain these special elements of the research process in arts organizations. "Organized Anarchy" and Its Consequences In their essay on the American college president, Michael Cohen and James March describe a form of organization they label an 18.

Cohen and Garet, "Reforming Educational Policy."</page><page sequence="20">206 POUCY ANALYSIS "organized anarchy."20 Such organizations, of which the university is their principal example, are characterized by problematic goals, uncertain technologies, and fluid participation of organization mem- bers in given administrative functions or decision areas.21 Although arts organizations vary greatly, the metaphor of "or- ganized anarchy" seems appropriate to them in general. Most arts organizations have goals that are either implicit or contradictory. Art museums seek to preserve collections and serve scholars at the same time they seek to educate the public. Performing-arts organ- izations attempt to maintain the highest standards of their art, pro- vide outlets for innovative works, and maintain a large paying audi- ence. In museums, different goals tend to reside in different profes- sional groups and lead to internal conflicts. In performing-arts or- ganizations, different goals surface at different times and rarely pro- vide stable reference points for decision. By the same token, in the absence of clear goals, organizational technologies are unclear. In Cohen and March's terms, the organ- ized anarchy "does not understand its own processes. Instead, it operates on the basis of a simple set of trial-and-error procedures, the residue of learning from the accidents of past experiences, imi- tation, and the inventions born of necessity."22 Arts organizations, perhaps even more than universities, have been notoriously resistant to attempts to institute formal rational planning and to analyze their own behaviors. Arts organizations also frequently suffer from the erratic partici- pation of particular actors in particular decision situations. Arts managers invariably complain, seemingly with justification, of be- ing overworked, of spending their days putting out small fires. In the museum world, as in universities, participants include profes- sionals primarily committed to scholarly specialties (curators) and boards of trustees whose involvement is usually intermittent and not entirely predictable. In the performing arts, the tempo of re- hearsal and presentation encourages a pattern of arousal and con- centration of energies on immediate performance goals, alternating with brief periods of fatigue and relaxation. 20.

Cohen and March, Leadership and Ambiguity, p. 3.</page><page sequence="21">SMALL-SCALE POLICY RESEARCH IN THE ARTS 207 Within organized anarchies, problems, solutions, participants, and choice opportunities are best seen as relatively independent factors; at any given time, they may become activated in almost any combination. Such an organization "is a collection of choices look- ing for problems, issues and feelings looking for decision situations in which they might be aired, solutions looking for issues to which they might be the answer, and decision makers looking for work."23 These patterns of organization have numerous consequences, but here we concern ourselves with only two that affect the ways in which arts organizations receive applied social research. Garbage Cans - Within organized anarchies, opportunities for choice become "garbage cans into which various problems and so- lutions are dumped by participants."24 Audience research studies appear to suffer a similar fate. A recommendation, based on a sur- vey of visitors, to place benches in museum galleries may become the occasion for a debate over the responsibility of a museum to its public. The initiation of an audience survey in a performing-arts organization can instigate a wide-ranging discussion of the impor- tance of planning or the need to develop new marketing strategies. Contrary to the problem-solving model, according to which research is undertaken to acquire data pertinent to specific problems, most arts organizations initiate research either for political reasons or because an opportunity presents itself; only then do problems, solu- tions, and participants attach themselves to the research process in a manner that may appear arbitrary to an outside observer. Random Disturbances - The garbage can element is related to the second notable characteristic of small-scale applied research - its tendency to take on the character of an apparently random dis- turbance and the arbitrary nature of its use. The impact of an audi- ence study, undertaken for political reasons or simply to take ad- vantage of an opportunity, depends upon the problems and persons with which it is associated. An arts audience study is used when and if some person within an arts organization becomes its champion and actively pushes action on the basis of its findings. An audience study is also used when it indicates the presence of a problem that can be solved with little expenditure of time or effort - for example, the absence of directional signs or audience preference for a slightly 23.

CONCLUSIONS The study of the impact of applied audience research on the policy and management of small-scale arts organizations reinforces several general hypotheses also applicable to the use of applied re- search by the federal bureaucracy: the problem-solving model of research utilization proves of little value in describing the impact of actual research on organizational decisions; research does not have to solve problems in order to be used, and in fact serves a variety of purposes other than problem solving; the extent and form of re- search utilization depend in part upon the nature of the user. The last point brings us to the ways in which the specific nature of small-scale organizational contexts causes applied research to be used differently than it is on the federal level. While it would be unwise to overstate the extent to which clear goals, set procedures, and constant participation of decision makers characterize federal bureaucracies, it seems clear that such attributes are particularly lacking in most of the small-scale, decentralized arts organizations we studied, and that their absence - and the presence of other fac- tors related to the structures and environments of these organiza- tions - shapes the way in which research findings are applied. First, small-scale research users are likely to be particularly un- concerned with the quality of the research they use.26 The willing- ness of arts managers to accept the findings of research that does not meet ordinary technical standards is, we feel, a rational response to several aspects of the environment in which arts organizations func- 25. For a fuller description of the determinants of utility and the role of advocates, see Paul DiMaggio and Michael Useem, "Applied Research in a Decentralized Setting: Factors Affecting the Utilization of Audience Re- search by Arts Organizations," Journal of Applied Behavioral Science 15 (1979): 79-94. 26. Evidence that federal decision makers are concerned with the tech- nical quality of the research they may use comes from studies by Caplan ("Social Research and National Policy") and by Carol H. Weiss and Michael J. Bucuvalas, "The Challenge of Social Research to Decision Making," in Using Social Research in Public Policy Making, ed. Carol H. Weiss (Lexing- ton, Mass.: Heath, 1977), pp. 213-33. Contrary evidence, however, comes from a study by Patton et al. ("In Search of Impact").</page><page sequence="23">SMALL-SCALE POLICY RESEARCH IN THE ARTS 209 tion. Most art organizations have little time, money, or experience with research and could not strive to undertake high-quality re- search even if they wanted to. Furthermore, most arts organizations have had virtually no systematic information about the composition, attitudes, or habits of their audiences; any source of information may be valuable in reducing uncertainty. Finally, lack of concern with technical quality reflects a recognition of the way in which re- search findings actually enter into the decision process - as mar- ginal, indirect, reinforcing, suggestive, expressive, tactical, or sym- bolic inputs that depend little on the precise technical methods employed. Second, when decentralized organizations, such as those in the arts, commission research, there is a high likelihood that they will use it. Such organizations tend to have very brief organizational memories; learning is rarely cumulative. Thus research that merely replicates the findings of countless other studies is usually news to those who sponsor it. The mere novelty of research for many organ- izations makes it a focus of interest and attention. Third, small-scale applied research is likely to be used randomly and arbitrarily, depending on when it is received and who is behind it. The flow of problems, energy, and participants through the arts organizations we studied tends to be highly variable. Fluctuating goals, procedures, and decision-making processes may lead to con- flict and inconsistency in the application of research findings. Where an individual has the time to attempt to implement a study's find- ings, those findings may well be implemented. Where the person most enthusiastic about the research leaves the organization or be- comes overwhelmed by other demands, study findings will be ig- nored. (On occasion, managers take audience studies from their old organizations to their new posts and use the findings there. Thus research on one audience is used to design programs for another.) Clearly, then, to understand the likely outcomes of small-scale policy research in a decentralized field, one can neither apply the problem-solving model of research utilization nor automatically ex- trapolate from the federal experience. Rather, one must take into account both models developed on the basis of observations of re- search at the federal level and the unique elements of the organiza- tional context within which the research is conceived and under- taken.</page></plain_text>
