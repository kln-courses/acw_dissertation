<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bears: The Need for a New Sanity in Wildlife Conservation Courtesy National Parks Service Gairdner B. Moment Recurring death and injury from bears in National Parks have underlined the need to re-evaluate some of the policies and procedures of our National Park Service. Probably more impor- tant, these ugly events have made it evi- dent that a re-examination is in order for some of our dogmatic, if well-inten- tioned, philosophies of wildlife conser- vation and the public relations based on them. Specifically, the problems of bears in National Parks merit close scrutiny because, with the possible exception of the redwoods, bears form the most con- spicuous point of contact between the general public and many of the issues of wildlife management. Every summer over ten million people visit parks where bears occur. Feeding and photographing black bears at the "bear jams" along the roads in Yellowstone has become a na- tional pastime. Bears have required much thought and untold man-hours of physi- cal work by the Park Service. Virtually all the millions who enter the parks have some contact with the Park Serv- ice, its literature, its exhibits, and per- sonnel. A large percentage of them attend the illustrated evening lectures given by the Service. Interest in bears is always high. Clearly, here is an un- excelled opportunity for conservation education and also a heavy responsibility. Views and actions not scientifically valid will not only mislead, but they could easily backfire to the detriment of the cause of conservation itself. Consequently, this mix of people, bears, and the Park Service presents a challenge to all who love the natural world and have a concern for the main- tenance of the best possible habitat for the human race. Therefore, we must help in every way to make sure that the wildlife conservation taught and prac- ticed is indeed scientifically based, that anthropomorphic and misleading ideas about animals are not encouraged, that extremist views about man's moral obligation to all species of animals are avoided, and that intelligent discrimina- tion is exercised at all times. In short, we must all - scientists, general public, and Park Service - face up to the facts, pleasant and unpleasant, ecological, behavioral, economic, and political. Hard choices and baffling The author is Professor of Biological Sciences at Goucher College, Baltimore, Md. December 1968 1105</page><page sequence="2">problems of great complexity confront us. A sense of wonder in the presence of Nature is a fine thing but it is not enough. As Lawrence Slobodkin (1968) has well said, solutions to the manifold problems of ecology "require more than a good heart." Bears: The Myths Bears today enjoy a privileged posi- tion in American folklore, evidently because of long continued and persisting mis-education. Most of us were raised with teddy bears in our play pens. Over TV our children receive weekly indoc- trination by the self-termed "Gentle Ben." For adults, there are the ubiqui- tous posters of Smokey the Bear. Peer- ing out from under his authoritative Ranger hat, he looks the very embodi- ment of sturdy dependability. Few peo- ple realize that even his slogan, "Only you can prevent forest fires," is mis- leading since a very large proportion of them are set by lightning. Remember the story of Goldilocks where the child is cast as a juvenile delinquent and the three bears as injured innocents! An attractive silhouette of a mother bear with cubs adorns many of the offi- cial leaflets handed out to visitors enter- ing National Parks. The special folder on grizzlies, which the Park Service prepared for distribution during the summer of 1968, features on its cover a photo of a museum exhibit showing a mother grizzly tearing open a dead log to find grubs for her half-grown twins. The emblem of the National Parks Association, carried on the mast- head of its magazine, is a mother grizzly followed by two cubs. The handsome colored brochure issued by "the Yellow- stone Park Company of Yellowstone National Park" features drawings of friendly bears handling your luggage, driving your car, and providing you with map information. One comes to feel that to be critical of bears is tanta- mount to denouncing man's best friend or perhaps taking a stand against moth- erhood. Bears: The Facts Injuries from black bears are an al- most daily occurrence during the tourist season in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and in Yellowstone. These injuries range from deep scratches which have to be sewed up, to mangled hands which require amputation. On several occasions early in the summer of 1967 grizzly bears chased up trees people who were fishing along the shores of lakes in Glacier National Park. Later that summer two campers were pulled from sleeping bags, dragged off into the woods, and killed by griz- zlies. One was partly eaten. A young man was so badly mauled that he had to be flown out by helicopter to undergo three hours of surgery. In a Forest Serv- ice campground along the Sun River about 100 miles southeast of Glacier, two sleeping boys were attacked by bears. One required prolonged hospi- talization. Across the border in the Canadian Rockies, two children were dragged off by bears and one, an 8-year- old, killed and eaten. There is nothing at all new about grizzly bear attacks. Within the past few years the U.S. Government has paid out $100,000 in damages on two differ- ent occasions because of grizzly bear injuries of a particularly horrible nature sustained within National Parks. The actual nature of the grizzly, Ursus horribilis (U. arctos), has long been well established. A booklet en- titled, "Mammals of Glacier National Park," by R. R. Lechleitner, published "in cooperation with the National Park Service," and sold in the Park last sum- mer, flatly states of the grizzly that "its presence is incompatible with human occupation." This is not surprising for a carnivore weighing up to over 800 lb. and so fast that only a horse or an ante- Courtesy National Parks Service lope can outrun it. Half a century ago, E. W. Nelson, then Chief of the U.S. Biological Survey, wrote in his Larger Mammals of North America that the grizzly is "America's fiercest and most dangerous big game" and went on to record that "even experienced hunters have been killed by them" and that "they stalk cattle by night, seizing their prey by the head, usually break its neck, but sometimes hold and kill by biting." These methods of attack were used by both grizzlies in the fatal cases in Glacier Park. The highly dangerous character of the grizzly has been amply confirmed by the magnificent studies of Frank and John Craighead (1966) on the grizzlies of Yellowstone. By placing radio transmit- ters in collars on these bears, they have been able to follow the wanderings and life histories of about 400 individuals over the past decade. Among other things, they have found that grizzlies habitually make shallow "day beds" from which they strongly resent being disturbed. The Craigheads also report that it is "extremely hazardous" to ap- proach a place where a grizzly has hid- den food. Furthermore, "if jumped or startled at close range, a grizzly is about as likely to charge as to run." Peter Mathiessen (1959), in a book widely hailed as a bible of conservation, ends his chapter on bears by admitting that the grizzly, "monarch of the wild," and man do not mix. 1106 BioScience Vol. 18 No. 12</page><page sequence="3">Park Service Solution On June 10, 1968, the National Park Service issued, over the signature of Superintendent Keith Neilson of Gla- cier, a long list of "Bear Management Responsibilities" for Park personnel, evidently based on an earlier "Bear Management Plan --1968." In addi- tion, there is the newly prepared folder, mentioned above, entitled, "In Grizzly Country," for distribution to Park vis- itors. The contents of these documents, once you grant their basic assumptions, make good enough sense. "Whatever you do, try to remain calm." "Wear bells or put pebbles in a tin can to rat- tle as you walk" but remember that "noise is not a foolproof way of avoid- ing bears." Speak to a threatening bear in "soft human monotones" while "look- ing for a tree to climb" because "a human can never expect to outrun a bear." If attacked, don't move. "Lying still under the jaws of a biting bear takes a lot of courage," the leaflet tells you. It continues by assuring you that such an act may prevent your death. But it is also clear from the record of recent years that "lying still under the jaws of a biting bear" may not. The detailed instructions to Park per- sonnel set forth in the directives of June 1968 are certainly useful, but the strik- ing overall fact about them is that, ex- cept for several special items, there is nothing very different from what is con- tained in the directives respecting bears issued in July 1960 or subsequently. The assertion that menstruating women are in special jeopardy is new and may very well be true. Two of the people killed during 1967 were such young women. However, two cases hardly form the basis of a firm scientific con- clusion, especially when other victims have been men and boys. Certainly lack of menstruation, or the lack of the de- odorants and cosmetics mentioned, are no more foolproof protection than rat- tling pebbles. New, and certainly all to the good, is the emphasis on packing out all trash and garbage and the issu- ance of plastic bags for this purpose. But otherwise the proposed measures seem variations of the same old proce- dures which the Service has been un- willing or unable to implement and enforce. The 1968 instructions to Park Naturalists tells them to "mention that bear feeding is prohibited not only as a matter of safety but also to preserve the natural scene." All Park personnel and especially Rangers are to admonish vis- itors not to feed bears and are given extensive duties in reporting incidents of bear molestations and closing trails and campsites after bear "incidents." The 1960 directives were more strin- gent, at least on paper. They specified "an aggressive program of bear warn- ing" and "an effective law enforcement program aimed at the prevention of bear feeding." Rangers in jeeps equipped with "bull horn" loud speakers were supposed to break up "bear jams." This 1960 procedure was evidently not feasible. As recently as 1967, with my wife and two of our children, I entered and re-entered Yellowstone, Glacier, and other parks where bears are found. We hiked the spectacular 8-mile trail from Logan Pass on Going- to-the-Sun Highway to Granite Park Chalets and together or separately ex- plored many other trails. At no time were we made aware of a bear-warning program. "Bear jams" occurred many times a day on the roads of Yellowstone while tourists fed and photographed black bears. There was no attempt at remonstrance, much less "an effective law enforcement program." One of the "attractions" at the chalet was to watch grizzlies eat garbage every evening. This was all the more puzzling because the 1960 directives plainly stated that "to tolerate infractions of the rule which prohibits feeding is a disservice both to the animals and the visitors," and the official Report of the Advisory Board of Wildlife Management (the so-called Leopold Report) to Secretary of the In- terior Udall said several years ago that "Fed bears become bums, and dan- gerous." One looks in vain for anything in the 1968 instructions which will make them more workable than the 1960 instructions. Warning signs are called for in the new as in the old procedures. Never- theless, none was evident at the chalet the day before the attack. Near the be- ginning of most trails we did see signs which included very general warnings about bears more or less buried among many other items of interest. They were unobtrusive signs and commonly one had to step well off the trail to read what they said. Hardly part of "an aggressive" program! The standard procedure for dealing with the bears themselves remains basically the same, namely, trap and remove to another part of the Park the so-called "problem bears" after they have become problems. Some of the specifics have been changed. For ex- ample, bears are now to be divided into back country bears and those frequent- ing roads and campsites and treated somewhat differently. A grizzly at a camp site can be trapped and removed "immediately upon a sighting" or even destroyed, except for bears trapped and tagged during a previous year. These shall be trapped and removed to a dis- tant part of the Park. On the other hand, except in unusual circumstances, a back country grizzly should not be trapped or disposed of until after it has molested campers at least twice. The tragic inadequacy of the "problem bear" policy has become only too evi- dent. Temporary closing of trails after serious bear "incidents" is repeated in the new instructions. One of the troubles with this closing-the-barn-door- afterward policy is that it can be ex- tremely difficult to implement just when needed most. For example, after the fatal night attack at the Granite Park Chalet in Glacier, the trails in were closed the next morning. Nevertheless, several hikers arrived at the chalet for breakfast. Quite innocently they had begun the trek in very early before the Rangers had had a chance to close the trails. Basic Assumptions The purpose of the Park Service Plan, as stated in the 1968 document, is "To preserve and maintain natural populations of bears while providing for the safety of Park visitors." Clearly, it is the double nature of this objective which, to a very large extent, creates the problem. The reason for adopting an objective with a built-in self-contra- diction lies in two assumptions. The first concerns a special view about man's relation to the rest of the animal king- dom. As put by R. M. Darnell (1967), "The dramatic need of our time is for an extension of the Golden Rule to cover man's relations with all living creatures." He explicitly declares that we have a "moral obligation" to elimi- nate "genocide" as applied to animal species. Others have written in a simi- lar vein. H. G. Cassidy (1967), for example, tells us that we must learn to regard our environment not as "It" but as "Thou." Despite such references to Martin Buber and other theologians, I find my- December 1968 1107</page><page sequence="4">self, as a zoologist, left a bit dizzy by what seems to be a new interdisciplinary field, biotheology. Would not such an extension of the Golden Rule make us all vegetarians? What could the Golden Rule really mean in terms of an alli- gator, or an aphid? Would not the per- sonification of nature be the basis for a prescientific anthropomorphism? At least I can find no directive in the Ten Commandments or even in the New Morality of situation ethics requiring that every species be saved from extinc- tion. More to the point, in the science of biology there is no categorical impera- tive that all species must be preserved. The science of biology merely asserts, in Dollo's law, that extinction is a ter- ribly final thing and that the extinction of species has been a regular part of the order of nature for hundreds of millions of years. The dramatic need of our time is for the intelligent control of our environ- ment, not its personification. A strong sense of stewardship for our wildlife heritage is indeed much needed in our own interests and those of generations yet unborn. But to acknowledge such a need should make it easier not to suc- cumb to a mindless absolutism claiming that every species should be preserved and no discrimination is possible. The Carolinas are less colorful today be- cause of the extinction of their native parakeet, and the world is poorer be- cause of the loss of many species. How- ever, any zoologist could draw up a list of animal and probably plant species that we would be better off without: the common rat, the fire ant, certain species of sharks, the tse-tse fly, the malarial organism. Of course, each of these species possesses ecological, physio- logical, evolutionary, and other aspects of considerable scientific interest. That isn't the point. So does every other species. Removal of any one would result in some change in the intricate web of nature. The upper Mississippi valley is not the same without the pas- senger pigeon. But this kind of thing has been going on all through the course of evolutionary history. The point is that to abdicate the use of human reason is to throw away the most powerful and unique tool Homo sapiens has. Why can't we discriminate? If a species like the grizzly, which is on the endangered species list, can be saved, all well and good. But there is no scientific basis for the dogmatic assertion that the Park Service or anyone else is obligated to save it or any other species without re- gard for the human cost in money, lives, or health. The second assumption, which ap- pears to underlie the Park Service Plan, is that the Service must attempt to pre- serve every species within every park without any thought for the familiar biological principle of specialization of functions and the division of labor. Consequently, Yellowstone, which boasts some of the most spectacular wonders in the world of geology, is supposed to serve also as a preserve for what is admitted on all sides to be our most dangerous carnivore, even though it is a species with a range extending for thousands of miles outside that park. Newer Possibilities Once it is admitted that intelligent discrimination is possible both in the amount of effort to be expended in sav- ing different species and in the use and development of different parks, then other solutions for these questions of wildlife conservation become possible. The morning after the fatal grizzly at- tacks in Glacier, the Park Naturalist on duty ably guided the 60 or so people, who had spent the night either in the chalet or in the nearby campsite, down to Going-to-the-Sun Highway. It was a very diverse group in age, sex, na- tionality, and occupation, but the re- action to the events of the previous night was virtually unanimous. The Park Service should make up its mind whether it wants to run a park for peo- ple or for bears! An over-simplifica- tion? It did not seem so at the time. Sober later thought indicates that it would make perfectly good ecological as well as common sense to designate certain parks, such as Yellowstone and Glacier, as areas primarily devoted to people for hiking, certain types of camp- ing, and similar activities, but above all for viewing those stupendous geological sights which form such important parts of our heritage of natural wonders. Old Faithful is unique to Yellowstone, bears are not. If it seems important to conserve the grizzly, there are other suitable habitats. This past year thousands of acres in the Northwest were newly set aside for the benefit of waterfowl. A similar action could be taken in some of the many mountainous regions already under gov- ernment control and sanctuaries set up for grizzlies. It sounds attractive to talk of main- taining "a natural population" of ani- mals in National Parks but when the species concerned is admittedly our "fiercest and most dangerous" carnivore, such a project cuts directly across the praiseworthy efforts, described by Jack Hope (1966), to get Park visitors out from behind their windshields and onto the trails. Furthermore, neither the black or the grizzly bears have formed natural populations for many years. For one thing, they have been con- sistently fed. Certainly as long as man and his works are present, the habitat will be modified and intelligent control and discrimination necessary. It is reassuring that the Leopold Re- port, already mentioned, most em- phatically takes this kind of realistic stand. Says the Report, "Management (of National Parks) may at times call for the use of the tractor, chainsaw, rifle, or flame-thrower but the signs and sounds of such activity should be hidden from visitors in so far as possible. ... A reasonable illusion of Primitive America can be retained or recreated using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecological sensitivity." Certainly the continued presence of grizzly bears in every park where they once lived can- not be held as essential to that happy illusion, nor are we under any "moral" obligation to maintain every species without discrimination.
