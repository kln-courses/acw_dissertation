<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYLLIS GRANOFF THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA A Study in the Texture of Allusion and the Weaving of a Group-Image (PART I) Modem scholarship knows Siddhasena Divâkara as an eminent phi losopher and particularly as a gifted logician. If there is still consider able disagreement as to his exact dates, his precise sectarian affiliation and the extent of his writings, there is at least unanimity on this point: that Siddhasena, who was the first to compose a manual of logic for the benefit of the Jain community, can be regarded as an outstanding representative of the elitist intellectual tradition of classical India with its deep regard for erudition and its predilection for complex, difficult and never widely accessible writings. In fact there is much in Siddhasena's extant corpus that is still a mystery to modern investigators, and the poor state of transmission of his writings combined with the lack of a reliable tradition of commentaries upon them suggests that his con temporaries and those who followed immediately after him found him a daunting prospect indeed.1 It comes therefore as a surprise to read the biographies of Siddhasena that the ávetambara community has transmitted, for the Siddhasena of the biographies is mocked when he is at his most formidably intellectual and applauded when he is most down to earth, speaking to the masses directly, either in their own vernacular language or in the still more universal tongue of miracles and supernatural feats. The deeds of Siddhasena are told in a number of medieval Jain texts.2 These include at least one collection of didactic stories dated 1134 A.D., the Âkhyànakamanikosavrtti of Ámradevasüri, and the standard prabandha collections, the Kahàvali of Bhadresvara, which remains unpublished but is said to date from the twelfth century A.D., the Prabhâvakacarita of Prabhâcandra, dated 1277 A.D., and the Prabandhakosa of Ràjasekharasûri, dated 1349 A.D. His biography also appears in brief in the collection that has been published under the title Purátanaprabandhasamgraha, in the Prabandhacintàmani .Journal of Indian Philosoohv 17: 329—384. 1989. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">330 PHYLLIS GRANOFF of Merutuñga, dated 1304 A.D., and in the pilgrimage text, the Vividhatirthakalpa of Jinaprabhasüri, dated 1333 A.D. It is also found in brief in the Jain recension of the Vikramacarita, the deeds of King Vikrama, a cycle of tales that was enormously popular in all of medieval India, and amongst Hindus as well as Jains.3 Each of these texts is distinctive in style and tone. The Àkhyànaka manikosavrtti is a Prakrit verse commentary that relates various stories to illustrate the Prakrit verses of the Âkhyànakamanikosa. Written in the vernacular, the Vrtti tells these often well-known stories in a familiar and easy language. The Prabandhakosa, although written in Sanskrit prose, for the most part continues the familiar tone of the didactic story collections like the Àkhyànakamanikosavrtti. Its lan guage is conversational, its sentences are brief and its syntax is simple. The Sanskrit sparkles with vernacular expressions and there is con siderable brisk and lively dialogue. The prose is highlighted by occasional verses, often in Prakrit and at times more complex than the prose itself. By contrast the Prabhâvakacarita is written in difficult Sanskrit verse, and is unlikely to have reached as wide an audience as the Prabandhakosa or the Âkhyànakamanikosa, if only because reading it requires a much higher level of sophistication and a high degree of education. The Vikramacarita and the Vividhatirthakalpa belong once more with the Âkhyànakamanikosa and the Prabandha kosa. The Vividhatirthakalpa has sections in Prakrit and in Sanskrit; the section on Siddhasena is in simple Sanskrit, and the Vikramacarita passage is likewise in readily understandable Sanskrit.4 These texts then exhibit considerable stylistic differences. They also differ in language and thus in the overall medium through which they present their material, and we shall see that they often display as well significant differences in content, in the specific details of Siddhasena's deeds that they relate. Nonetheless they share one important feature that I would stress in my analysis of Siddhasena's transformation in the traditional biographies. Siddhasena the philosopher appears in his traditional biography as repenting for his being overly fond of learning and of formal Sanskrit learning in particular, and his skill in debate is made the cause for much hilarity at his expense.5 In searching for a possible motivation for this radical transformation I should like to consider first the nature</page><page sequence="3">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 331 of these texts in which the biographies of Siddhasena came to achieve written form and thus official sanction, to see if this might not provide some direction to the course of this investigation. The first feature about these texts that I would mention is that they all belong to the Svetàmbara Jains and that all of them extend beyond the limiting confines of any one particular sub-group or gaccha within àvetàmbara Jainism. For example, in marked contrast to that other group of biographical texts from medieval S vet ambara Jainism, the pattàvalis or gurvàvalis, which relate the deeds of a particular group of monks who all belong to a specific lineage or gaccha, the prabandhas extol the deeds of monks from a variety of different groups. For their part, the didactic story collections also use to illustrate their points the deeds of monks from many different lineages, and are often seemingly oblivious to the precise origin of a monk and neglect even to provide this information. To some extent this may reflect the fact that the stories predate the period of division into fixed lineages, but there would have been nothing to preclude the later insertion of such information, and one must conclude that its lack of prominence in these texts is meaningful.6 In addition, the prabandhas, in contrast to the pattàvalis and gurvàvalis, though sometimes compiled after those texts, seem to have deliberately chosen to relate the deeds of monks who lived many centuries before the prabandhas were compiled, and thus were active before the period in which the Svetambara com munity began to experience its great fragmentation. Indeed these early monks were often incorporated into many of the different lineages, even those of mutually hostile groups; given the fact that the actual historical patriarchs lived so late in the tradition and there existed a need to create an unbroken line of succession back to the tïrthankaras, or founders of Jainism, it was but natural that these early monks would be made part of a number of different lineages.7 In their very choice of subject, then, the prabandhas would seem to be concentrating on the lives of those monks who would have been most widely acceptable to ávetámbara Jains regardless of any particular loyalty to a local group or gaccha. I should like to investigate here whether this concern for addressing a wide audience that extends beyond the dividing barriers of local affiliations might not in fact also account for the strange transformation of Siddhasena Divàkara from philosopher</page><page sequence="4">332 PHYLLIS GRANOFF into miracle worker. I should also like to see if there is anything about the way these texts relate their accounts of Siddhasena that likewise might be taken to imply such an aim of reaching the larger community and speaking directly to all the splinterings and fragments of that whole. I shall first describe briefly the nature of the medieval ¡Svetámbara Jain community and then consider more specifically the prabandhas and the stories of Siddhasena. The medieval Svetàmbara community was split into a number of different groups. In many cases the names of these groups reflect their local origins and strong local affiliations. The two major groups in Northwest India were the Kharataragaccha, mainly centered in Rajasthan and dating back to the eleventh century A.D., and the Tapàgaccha, which was centered in Rajasthan and Gujarat and dates to the thirteenth century A.D. Epigraphical sources reveal the names of scores of other local groups, most of which came to prominence sometime in the eleventh century or later.8 Relationships between these various groups were not always peaceful, and intense competi tion could and did break out between rival monks seeking royal patronage and local support. What divided these groups in terms of doctrine and ritual observance is not always clear to the modern historian; although there do exist records of debates in the various pattâvalis and there is the occasional polemical text, all of these accounts are clearly written with a noticeable bias and must be treated by the historian with care. Nonetheless what is undeniable from a reading of these sources is that local lineages of monks regarded themselves as standard bearers of a tradition that had somehow become corrupted by their opponents at other religious centers.9 Most often the points of difference would seem to have devolved upon the interpretation of scriptural passages dealing with ritual matters, and often with the proper deportment of a monk. Whatever the fine points were that held these various local groups apart from each other, and some of this information may in fact be lost to us, the available sources are nonetheless unanimous in painting the relationships between the groups as agonistic and marked by strident competition. If the various accounts in the exclusively sectarian pattâvalis have any basis in reality, then it would also seem prudent to conclude that philosophy and philosophical argument and debate played a promi</page><page sequence="5">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 333 nent role in that competitive atmosphere. It is this last observation that I find decisive for an understanding of the anti-intellectual bias of Siddhasena's biography and its devaluing of his contribution as a philosopher. Acuity in philosophical argument was clearly regarded by the authors of the pattàvalis as a necessary gift for the monk who would see to it that his group prospered at the expense of rival groups by defeating their members in open public debate; at the same time, however, they show a definite reluctance to encourage monks to enter into debate unless first challenged, emphasizing the caution with which debate, and philosophy — for the two go hand in hand — must be regarded by those who would seek truth. Even in the aggressively sectarian first part of the Kharataragacchabrhadgurvávali, the section that was written by Jinapàla, we read the admonitory words of the monk Jinapriya, warning against too great eagerness in seeking out debate. A local ruler has just proposed that the head of the Kharatara monks, the young Jinapatisüri, debate with a Digambara in his realm. Jinapriya explains that it is regarded as unseemly in his community actively to seek out an opportunity to debate. Monks in his community will of course fight back when attacked by those who make trouble, whether because they are overwhelmed with pride in their own learning or because they are intent on disparaging the true doctrine. One may see in Jinapriya's words an understanding of the danger that actively seeking debate is divisive and ultimately destructive for the commu nity.10 This same text also makes clear that there is a major problem with philosophical argument and debate: it should in fact be possible for a skilled debater, someone who is learned in philosophy, to argue convincingly an incorrect position. Indeed a monk who has been challenged might be forced to support the wrong position in order to prove himself greater than the challenger, and by implication, to prove his doctrine better than the false doctrines of his opponent. This is what happens in the Kharataragacchabrhadgurvávali to the child-monk Jinacandrasüri, leader of the Kharatara monks before Jinapatisüri. He is attacked by a rival Jain monk, Padmacandràcàrya, who asks him what he has been studying. He answers that he has been studying the Nyâyakandali, at which point Padmacandra asks him if he has under stood the Nyàya-Vaisesika discussion of darkness as a quality, rather than as a substance, which is the Jain position. Jinacandra replies in</page><page sequence="6">334 PHYLLIS GRANOFF the affirmative, only to then be asked by Padmacandra if he agrees with the viewpoint expressed in the Kandali. Jinacandra offers the judicious reply that truth is in fact independent of debating position, and suggests that it is possible indeed to prove in debate the Nyâya Vaisesika position. He challenges Padmacandra at this point, sug gesting that he himself could do just that against Padmacandra.11 Padmacandra is furious and shouts that Jinacandra could never stand against him in a debate if Padmacandra were to put forth the position that darkness is a substance, leaving Jinacandra in fact to argue the Nyàya doctrine. Jinacandra's reply is particularly significant in light of the debate that will convert Siddhasena, a debate held not in the king's court as was usual, but in a village field. Jinacandra demands that they go to the king's court to hold the debate, for he says, "the forest is the battleground for animals and creatures that resemble them".12 It is, I hope, clear from these two anecdotes, that even in a text where a competitive tone dominates, debate and philosophical argument have a somewhat ambiguous position. It is to this point, the status of philosophy and philosophical argument in medieval accounts of monks, that I would now turn to see how it might provide some direction for an investigation of the radical transormation that the philosopher Siddhasena underwent in his biographies. As in the story of Jinacandra, philosophical brilliance in religious biographies is generally regarded less as a means to achieve realization of the truth, which is accomplished instead through religious austerities, service of a guru and radical insight, than as a tool in a struggle with other contending groups. This is true even outside the pattàvalis of the various local Jain groups. There exist a number of texts that extol the deeds of the Vedànta founders, the philosophers par excellence in the Indian tradition, and it is clear that for these texts philosophical argument and philosophical acumen are really adjuncts in the competi tive struggle between various groups. The ability to tangle with knotty and intricate problems of exegesis is above all a weapon in hostile encounters. In fact the Vedànta founders engage in a world-conquest, a digvijaya, similar to the world-conquest that kings must undertake, and in doing so they meet and best their rivals in a series of agonistic encounters that usually involve philosophical debates. Philosophy in these texts, then, is not so much a way to realize truth as it is a means</page><page sequence="7">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 335 to propagate truth and that task invariably involves hostility and aggression.13 When we come back to the Jain prabandhas we see at once that their attitude towards philosophical argument is essentially the same. Philosophical debate is an agonistic contest and the stakes make it clear that it is a serious one indeed. Siddhasena wagers that he will become the disciple of the man who bests him in debate; the monk Bappabhattisüri participates in a debate in which the royal patron of the loser must surrender his kingdom to the patron of the winner; Jinesvarasüri bests Sûràcàrya before King Durlabharàja on the agreement that the losers will be expelled from the kingdom, and Haribhadra engages in a debate where defeat means death to the loser.14 Philosophy, in these texts, then, is closely linked with contests and with conflict.15 It is this fact and the observation made above that the prabandhas seem deliberately to tell the lives of uncontroversial figures in the tradition that have led me to the ultimate conclusion that the traditional biographies have deliberately transformed Siddhasena from philosopher to miracle-worker because philosophers were potentially conflictual figures engaged in agonistic behaviour and emphasis on philosophy could serve as a reminder of the hostile relationships between the various Svetâmbara groups, while the Jain miracle-worker could bestow benefits on all his co-religionists regard less of their local affiliation. This is not to imply that the various prabandhas do not depict Jain philosophers debating with and defeating enemies; the prabandhas offer ample incidents such as the ones I have cited above, but the enemies are almost always external enemies, Buddhists or Hindus, and the overall picture of the monk in the prabandhas is very much like that of Siddhasena, as miracle worker and wandering ascetic, at times close to royal power and himself the very source of that power, and most importantly easily accessible to the majority of believers through the hymns he writes and the miracles he performs.16 It is also true that monks in the more aggressively sectarian biographies like the Kharataragacchabrhadgurvâ vali are also regarded as miracle workers; the Kharatara accounts of its leaders sparkle with stories of miracles and marvelous deeds. What is different in those accounts, however, is that there is no devaluation</page><page sequence="8">336 PHYLLIS GRANOFF of philosophy or learning as I will argue there is in the prabandha accounts of Siddhasena.17 My contention in the analysis of Siddhasena's biographies, thus, will be that the close association of philosophy and the philosopher with debate and conflict that we can observe in the traditional lives of the great philosophers, Hindu and Jain, and that perhaps reflects actuality as well as literary convention, provides a clue to an understanding of the radical transformation of Siddhasena in the traditional stories told about him. The work that modern scholars consider to be Siddhasena's main philosophical work, his Sanmatitarka, is nowhere mentioned in the biographies in the prabandhas and related sources. His other texts, all showing erudition and philosophical brilliance, are devalued as intellectual accomplishments and revalued as mantras, spells that when recited lead to miraculous results. His bravado performance in philosophical debate is made the occasion of a humorous parody of the entire intellectual tradition with all its elitist overtones, and the central event of his life becomes a penance that he must undertake because he is too committed to Sanskrit learning and wants to translate the Jain texts into Sanskrit, a penance that culminates in his celebration as a wandering ascetic and miracle worker. In their task of drawing together the many factions of the Jain community, the prabandhas chose to create an image of Siddhasena, the individual monk, and by metonymy of their community at large, that spanned bridges and glossed over the potential for quarrels. This image was of the monk as hymn-maker, story-teller and miracle worker, and their choice of these incidents in Siddhasena's life created an image of Siddhasena that was least controversial and of widest appeal. I shall also try to show that the way in which these incidents were related also helped achieve this end. To anticipate some of these points that will be developed in detail below, the tradition tells of Siddhasena stories that were rich in resonances to the lives and deeds of other famous men, monks and kings, within the Svetambara Jain tradition and even outside the Svetàmbara tradition in the Digambara texts and in Hinduism as well. In short many of the stories told of Siddhasena are allusions; they are allusions to other similar stories told in the prabandhas themselves, which make these tales then internally allusive, and they are also</page><page sequence="9">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 337 allusions to stories told in other traditions.18 This complex network of allusion has the effect of leading the reader to assume a familiarity with the monk whose life is told; beyond the boundaries of limited local affiliations, through familiar stories the reader is encouraged to reach out and embrace the subject of the biography whose deeds he knows well in another, totally uncontroversial context. My contention will be that through a skillful interlocking of stories the tradition has created a biography of Siddhasena that subordinates the need to create a unique portrait of a single monk to an even more pressing need to create a group-consciousness that will appeal to a wide audience of believers. The resonances that particular events in Siddhasena's life have to other events in the lives of famous figures in the pan-Indian tradition or in the Jain tradition create for the reader a sense of deja-vu, a sense of being on familiar territory and a willing ness to acknowledge the sanctity of the subject of the story without regard for or despite his particular local affiliation. Repetition of familiar stories and allusion will be seen as key devices in weaving a texture for Siddhasena's biography that includes some threads from everyone's skein. In unraveling some of that texture I shall begin with a discussion of the earliest biography of Siddhasena available to me, that in the Àkhyànakamanikosavrtti, and a study of its elusive allusive ness, and proceed then to show how this process of balancing the need for an individualized portrait with the deeper need for creating an image of a monk that is recognizably acceptable to a wide group is continued in the later texts as allusions are expanded and developed. I shall then conclude with some general remarks on what this study of Siddhasena can tell us about the prabandhas as a group of texts, summing up the basic conclusions that I shall have reached. I. THE SVETÀMBARA BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA: THE ÀKHYÀNAKAMANIKOÉA VRTTI There was in the city of Ujjain a Jain monk, learned in the Jain doctrine, the crest-jewel of the host of wise men, Vrddhavàdin by name. Because he was overly proud of his learning he made a solemn oath that he recited before all and sundry, in a Sanskrit verse that went like this:</page><page sequence="10">338 PHYLLIS GRANOFF My cow's horn is the size of the pole that stands aloft in Indra's festival; fire is cold and wind is still; or if that doesn't suit you then name whatever impossible thing that comes to your mind. Vrddhavâdin will declare it is true and who will dare to contradict him? Now hearing these words that were so filled with pride, a Brahmin by name of Siddhasena, accompanied by his own disciples and bristling with anger, went out to meet Vrddhavâdin to challenge him to a formal debate, thinking to himself all the while, "How dare he or anyone else pick a quarrel with the Brahmins?" Now no sooner had the Jain monk gone to some village or other than Siddhasena, thinking that he had conveniently vanished from the scene, pursued him at once. And as he continued in his wanderings the Jain monk was soon overtaken by the young Brahmin students. And they shouted out to him, "Hey you, in the white robe, where are off to? What do you mean by disappearing like that?" And the monk answered, "I haven't run off anywhere. After all what do I have to be afraid of"? And while they were talking in this way Siddhasena himself arrived on the scene. He said, "Fulfill that solemn oath of yours. Engage with me in a formal debate." The monk replied, "Let us go to the city in the presence of learned men." The other one answered, "No. Let the debate be held right here." And the Lord of Monks said, "But there are no learned men here who could serve as judges." And he said, "So, what about that? Debate with me right here." And the monk on his part countered, "Then let these cowherds and farmers be the judges and witnesses." And when the other had assented the cowherds and farmers were all called together by the monk. "He who loses will become the disciple of the one who wins." This is the solemn oath that was made by Siddhasena in the presence of all the farmers. When the King of Monks said, "You first state your proposition", then the Brahmin began to speak, using the Sanskrit language. There is no such thing in the world as an omniscient being, for none of the five valid means of knowledge can grasp him. And therefore I say that he is the object of the valid means of knowledge that reveals non-existents, just like a lotus in the sky, which is an absolute fiction. Let me explain in greater detail. An omniscient being is not perceived directly through ordinary sense-perception by anyone in this world. And because there is no inferential mark possible for him he is also not the object of inference. He cannot be grasped by the means of knowledge</page><page sequence="11">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 339 that operates through perception of similarities since there is nothing in the world that is similar to him. And that sun of the world, the illuminator of all things, cannot be known through the means of valid knowledge we call presumption which makes known something or someone without whom an impossibility would result, for in fact without him everything proceeds quite normally. Therefore it is obvious that the omniscient being must be the object of the means of valid knowledge which reveals only the non-existent. Give up at once your stubborn and wrongful insistence on his existence. All knowledge of religious merit and sin is to be had from the Vedas alone. And when the Veda is available to us all, of divine and not human origin and thus free from any flaw that might result from a human author, eternal, what need is there to go about imagining the existence of an omniscient being? And for his part, the glorious Vrddhavâdin, having heard this argument to refute the existence of an omniscient being which was proposed there by that twice-born in a court where the judges were but farmers, spoke these words which were far more fitting to the occasion. Good deeds and righteous living according to the true faith together are the lord of all creatures. Without them. . . (text is broken off at this point). Through the power of such good deeds and righteousness men become blessed with fortune. What good is life if one is born in a land that the true doctrine has not reached? What use is a man who is but a burden to his mother the earth, who does nothing but eat and drink, who wanders again and again in this cycle of rebirths and who has not made the true doctrine his devoted friend? After he had recited these verses the Lord of Monks then asked the assembled farmers who were the honored court judges of the debate, "Now you tell us whose words, his or mine, are true." They said, "Your words are like the nectar of the gods to our ears. But we didn't under stand even a word of what that one muttered. What did he say anyway? We couldn't get a word of it at all." Now the monk told them, "Listen, for this is the gist of what he said. He said that in your temple there is no Arhat." They said, "There is so. Why, we just prayed to him a little while ago. Even if our own father told us that we would say he lied. "And with these words they seized the Brahmin by the arms and held him fast. They said, "Come, so that we can show you the Arhat in the Jain temple." And they all shouted victory! victory! to that best Lord of Monks. And the Brahmin, intending fully to make good the solemn oath he had made earlier, said, "I am your disciple. Ordain me as a monk." And in this way Siddhasena was ordained by the Lord of Monks on an</page><page sequence="12">340 PHYLLIS GRANOFF auspicious day. And that great and noble man penetrated all the secrets of the true doctrine. The monk installed him, who was filled with all good qualities, in his very own position, and Siddhasena then wandered as a Jain monk bringing glory to the most excellent teaching of the Jain sages. In his wanderings all over the earth it happened to pass that he came to the city Ujjain. He heard people mocking the Jain writings because they were composed in Prakrit. He summoned the Jain monastic community and with hands folded in respectful submission he said these words to their head, "If the community so instructs me in its wisdom and graciousness then I shall put all the Jain writings into Sanskrit." Now hearing these words the members of the monastic community went on to say this, "Never mind speaking such terrible words. It is unworthy of you even to think such a thought. For the very thought of such a thing demands a great penance." Siddhasena then said, "I have committed a grave offense that requires a great penance. It is no longer proper that I should remain here. Let the community of monks show favour to me and name my penance through the practice of which I shall become purified." And they gave as his penance that he roam twelve years, concealing his identity as a Jain monk, for this was the proper penance for such a sin. Granted leave by the community of monks, Siddhasena, the Lord of Monks, concealing his true identity as a Jain monk, began to carry out his penance. And pure in mind and steadfast as he wandered the earth he thought, "How lucky are those best of monks, worthy of praise and honour in the three worlds, who do not step off the true path as I have. Ever resplendent in the glory of their perfect conduct, may they rejoice forever in the world." And exactly at that time, when the full twelve years had passed for this man who had destroyed his sin by means of such pure thoughts, he chanced to arrive in Avantï. Mindful and heedful of the true doctrine he stopped at a temple to Siva known as "Kudañgesvara". He did not say a word of praise to the God there. The townspeople came to know this and they informed the king, "O Lord, there is an ascetic who hides his true identity who is staying at the temple Kudañgesvara. He does not praise the God there." Hearing their words the king went there. He asked, "Who are you?" And the other answered, "I am a righteous man." Then the king</page><page sequence="13">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 341 said, "Why do you not praise the God here?" And the other gave his reply, "This God would not endure my praise." At this the king then said, "That may be. Let us see. Praise the God. My curiosity is aroused." Thinking, "Let me cause the true faith to prosper here", he said, "Let me do so in the presence of everyone assembled here." And on the twelfth day after that, the whole town, including the king, gathered at the temple. And the Jain monk Siddhasena, having carried out the proper rituals of purification, remembering in his heart the Lord of the Jinas, began to sing praises with his thirty-two hymns of thirty-two stanzas each. Through her supernatural knowledge the protecting Goddess of the Jain faith knew that this was to be the occasion for a great triumph for Jainism, and in her devotion to the faith she arrived there. In the meantime out of the middle of the beautiful forehead of the God there suddenly began to appear an image of the Jina Pàrsvanàtha, calm and beatific in appearance, there at the end of all the thirty-two hymns. The people and the king all saw it and all attested that it was real. Seeing this miracu lous event, this wonder that redounded to the credit of the Jain Faith, many people were enlightened. The cause of the true faith was greatly advanced.19 This is the account of Siddhasena in the Ákhyânakamanikosavrtti. It begins in the time-honored style of all Indian story-telling by setting the scene and naming the main characters. The scene is Ujjain, a bustling and prosperous city in many Jain stories, and the main characters are the Jain monk Vrddhavàdin, whose name literally means, "the old debater", and a Brahmin Siddhasena. There is little by way of description in this opening. The city is merely named, unlike many other stories in which some adjectives, often in the form of long compounds, are provided. Similarly Vrddhavàdin is only briefly characterized as "the crest-jewel of the host of wise men". The text then moves quickly from such generalities to specifics. The narrator tells us that Vrddhavàdin is overly proud of his own learning and that he has therefore made the outrageous promise that he can prove in debate anything at all, even the most impossible of propositions. Vrddhavàdin is allowed to speak for himself at this point, and his challenge to the world is quoted in the form of a Sanskrit verse. The question of what language should be used by Jain monks is central to the story of Siddhasena, and it is worth remembering that Vrddhavàdin, precisely when he is said to be overcome by pride and suffering from</page><page sequence="14">342 PHYLLIS GRANOFF haughtiness, speaks Sanskrit.20 The narrator's characterization of Vrddha vàdin is at this point essential in guiding our perceptions of the role of Sanskrit and in making a negative evaluation of its use by the Jain monk. The narrator then resumes the story, introducing Siddhasena as a Brahmin, who has already achieved some eminence for his own learning, as we can infer from his having his own group of disciples (vs 4). More importantly, here too the narrator provides an explicit judgment of his character, suggesting that Siddhasena is also suffering from the sin of pride, in this case pride in his birthright, for he is described as being unable to stand the haughty words of the Jain monk and as reacting in anger to the very idea that anyone should challenge a Brahmin (vs 5). There is a significant omission here; nothing is said of Siddhasena's own learning or intelligence, though we have clearly been given to understand that Vrddhavàdin is learned if arrogant. Siddhasena is also described at this point as acting rashly; he is gurumaratta (vs 4), unable to stand the haughtiness of the Jain, and in vs. 6 he hastily pursues him (jhatti dhàio tassa patthïe). The narrator by skillfully employing a few carefully chosen adjectives and adverbs and skillfully omitting others has instructed us well as to how we should view both Siddhasena and Vrddhavàdin. Vrddhavàdin is a great monk, although given to the sin of pride in his own prodigious learning, while Siddhasena is rash, not wise, and overly proud of being a Brahmin. The contest between them will centre in fact on this last point: what is on trial is not simply one man and his religious affiliation, or any specific religious doctrine; what is in question is in fact all of tradi tional Brahmanical culture and learning, which are typified by Sanskrit and by the formal structure of argument in Sanskrit philosophy. We are at this moment in fact already prepared for the outcome. The only Sanskrit words in the text so far have been the outrageous challenge of Vrddhavàdin, the product of his own overweening pride, as the narrator has distinctly informed us. Sanskrit culture, false pride in birth, conceit and arrogance over learning, all are embodied by the Sanskrit language and Sanskrit culture, and it is their defeat for which we have been carefully primed. After this brief but essential introduction by the narrator, which has lasted only six and a half verses, the story moves rapidly into dialogue. Most of the remaining forty-five verses will be direct speech between</page><page sequence="15">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 343 the actors in the story. The dialogue is even more clipped and sparing than the narration was; sentences are short, there are few if any compounds and those that do occur are short and readily familiar, such as "muninda" "Lord of monks", often used as an epithet for Vrddhavâdin (vs. 13, for example). The pace of the action is further accelerated by the fact that the text uses pronouns instead of actual names. The names are longer, and where they do occur they arrest our attention by slowing the action. So for example, when Siddhasena has finished expounding his proofs for the non-existence of an omniscient being and Vrddhavâdin returns to the limelight, he is introduced not as simply the monk, or that one, but as Sirividdhavài, the "Glorious Vrddhavâdin", creating a pause in the action and a noticeable emphasis. The dialogue continues for some time, with the narrator only appearing each time the speaker changes with the short phrase, "he said", or "that one said". The narrator then steps in as the debate reaches its climax. His remarks, though brief, are nonetheless once more highly significant in guiding our understanding and interpretation of the events. In verse 20 the narrator tells us that Vrddhavâdin replies in a way that is halaharasahàe uciyam, "suitable in a court where the judges are farmers." His reply moreover is of a totally different nature from Siddhasena's argumentation; it has nothing to do with philosophy and does not attempt in any way to meet Siddhasena's arguments. Although the text is broken off at this point it is clear that Vrddhavâdin offers to the farmers not philosophy, but simple gnomic verses in praise of the religious life. Were it not for the narrator's insistence that Vrddhavâdin is correct in evading Siddhasena because he has taken into account the nature of his audience, we might be tempted to judge the debate otherwise. The narrator intervenes again after Vrddhavâdin's speech has concluded, describing how the farmers shout victory to the Jain and grab Siddhasena to lead him off to the temple, and how Siddhasena intends to keep his own promise and acknowledge defeat. The narrator's remarks are still short through all of this and soon the individual actors in this drama are allowed to resume the burden of carrying the story as Siddhasena himself proclaims his desire to become Vrddhavâdin's disciple. We are then finally told something of</page><page sequence="16">344 PHYLLIS GRANOFF Siddhasena's intellectual gifts: he is in vs 28 said to have mastered all of the Jain teachings, sayalasiddhantapàragàmï, and he is a great and noble man, mahàsatta. Further, in vs. 29 he is bahugunaganaparikalia, endowed with many great qualities, these all standard terms to describe an outstanding monk. The narrator then continues, setting the scene for the next major crisis in Siddhasena's life, just as he had introduced the first episode. In verse 30 in a remarkable act of symmetry we are returned to Ujjain. The narrator again explicitly provides us with the means to interpret what follows, exactly as he had in the debate. Siddhasena, he tells us, has heard people belittle Jainism because the Jain texts are written in Prakrit and not Sanskrit. We are also returned to the same issue that lay behind the debate between Siddhasena and Vrddhavàdin, and we are told that it is not Siddhasena who doubts the primacy of the vernacular over Sanskrit. His own conversion to Jainism and to Prakrit culture was in fact successfully accomplished in the debate with Vrddhavàdin. It is the urban populace who remain to be con verted to the same truth. It is important that Siddhasena's motivations are clearly stated by our author, who deftly intervenes at this juncture, for we shall see that the tradition did not always view Siddhasena's desire to put the Jain corpus into Sanskrit in the same light. The implication of the debate between Siddhasena and Vrddhavàdin was profoundly anti-intellectual; cowherds and farmers are suitable judges of truth and Sanskrit argumentation is worthless in the face of simple Prakrit verses. Not all of our texts found this lesson so easily learned, and some permitted Siddhasena to continue from time to time to labour under the assump tion that Sanskrit culture had merit, requiring him again and again to learn otherwise, a course of learning that finally culminates in this episode. Our narrator's comments, thus, are essential here in our reading of this version and we shall return to them again later. After the narrator's stage-setting, we move immediately into direct discourse once more. Siddhasena summons the monastic community, offering to put the texts into Sanskrit, and is punished for his unspeak able suggestion. He is given the penance, and ultimately he performs the miracle at Avanti and converts the king and the populace. It is worth pausing to note that the king here is not named; other accounts</page><page sequence="17">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 345 will give him a very prominent identity as Vikramiditya, and Siddha sena's biography will circulate outside of the prabandhas in the cycle of tales associated with this king, and in two prabandhas, the Praband hacintàmani of Merutuñga and the one included in the collection entitled the Puràtanaprabandhasamgraha, events of Siddhasena's life will be found in the sections on Vikramàditya. The practice of sanctifying a figure or a holy site by telling a story in which a leading and well-known king plays a major role is a time-honored practice in the world of Indian religious story-telling, and the Àkhyànakamaniko savrtti is unusual in allowing the king to remain anonymous.21 To conclude, then, in this episode in a close parallel to the episode of the debate, Sanskrit learning and Sanskrit culture make way for more popular forms of expression, here not gnomic verse but spectacular miracles. That Siddhasena's hymns of praise are themselves written in difficult Sanskrit is not mentioned, a deliberate omission, I would suspect, where the power of a sacred word is meant to transcend the very medium of language. I have taken this opportunity to examine the techniques used by Âmradeva in his account of Siddhasena because as we shall see other texts tell the same stories but with different techniques and with correspondingly different results. My ultimate interest is in the image of Siddhasena that each biographical account conveys, an image that is as much conditioned by such devices as authorial comment and the use of dialogue as it is by actual details in the story plot. I should like now to turn to a discussion of the individual stories that constitute this biography in and of themselves, to a consideration of their wider context within Jain religious tales and Indian narrative literature as a whole, before returning to the text of the Âkhyanakamanikosavrtti to see how these familiar themes have been manipulated by our author and how we thereby come to understand Siddhasena and the two major crises in his life which the biography relates. II. SIDDHASENA'S CONVERSION TO JAINISM: COMIC INVERSION AND THE PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATE We have seen in the discussion above that the Âkhyânakamaniko savrtti account of Siddhasena essentially consists of two parallel</page><page sequence="18">346 PHYLLIS GRANOFF episodes, the conversion of the Brahmin Siddhasena to Jainism as a result of a philosophical debate, and the expulsion of the Jain monk Siddhasena from the community for a period of twelve years, culmi nating in his performing a miracle in the Siva temple in Avanti. The parallelism of these two episodes, which look superficially to be totally distinct, consists first and foremost in their both revolving around the same issue, the primacy of popular culture, represented by the Prakrit language as opposed to Sanskrit, by certain literary forms such as gnomic verses as opposed to the formal argument of the inference, and by the universal language of miracles over the elite language of Sanskrit. In addition, both of these episodes share the important fact that each has a rich and recognizable context within the tradition of story-telling in Jainism and in other religions in India. Stories of conversion occur often in the Jain prabandhas. Indeed many of the monks who figure in these texts were not born into Jain families, but only later became Jains.22 At times the story of their conversion forms a central episode of the biography, while on other occasions it is simply mentioned and is not made part of the essential drama of the monk's life.23 Siddhasena's conversion is thus not a unique event in the world of these texts. In fact it has an extremely close counterpart in the story of the conversion of another famous Jain philosopher, someone who is similarly revalued in the traditional biographies as primarily a magician and not as the outstanding logician and philosopher that his writings tell us he was. This is Haribhadra, who before his conversion to Jainism is depicted as a buffoon, a comically arrogant Brahmin whose behaviour borders on the manic as he carries a shovel, a ladder and a net to seek out adversaries on land, at sea and in the air to defeat in debate.24 Haribhadra also wears shoes over his eyes to show that he does not need to see with his flesh and blood senses, having the inner eye of wisdom, and he covers his belly with a metal plate for fear it will burst with all the learning that it contains. Haribhadra becomes a Jain because he has made the rash promise that he will become the disciple of anyone whose words he cannot understand, and by chance he encounters a Jain nun who recites a Prakrit stanza from the Âvasyaka on the Jain culture heroes. He admits his defeat at once and submits to the Jain faith.25 Haribhadra, like Siddhasena, is thus not depicted as experiencing</page><page sequence="19">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 347 any internal emotional or religious revolution; he has made a solemn oath that he respects. A second point of similarity between the manner in which the traditional biographies describe the conversions of Haribhadra and Siddhasena is that in each case the victor has employed a Prakrit verse. Haribhadra, the purohita of the king of Citraküta, is as much the representative of Brahmanical culture as Siddhasena, and his defeat for failing to understand a Prakrit verse is as much the defeat of that culture as it is an individual defeat. The story of Siddhasena's conversion, then, with the arrogant Brahmin brought low by Prakrit verses, immediately calls to mind the conver sion of Haribhadra. We shall see later that in some of the other versions of Siddhasena's biography additional episodes appear that greatly strengthen the connection between these two men. The prime difference at this point between their conversion stories is that the story of Siddhasena involves a more thoroughgoing rejection of Brahmanical learning, including philosophy as a whole, the very usage of philosophical argument, and the Sanskrit language. Much of this can be inferred from Haribhadra's biography; Siddhasena's story in its reproduction of the details of the debate between Vrddhavàdin and Siddhasena makes it virtually explicit. Both stories also share a distinctly comic tone, and it is to this feature of Siddhasena's conver sion that we must now turn our attention. If the philosophical debate is an even more familiar scene in religious biographies than the conversion scene, the debate held in a village with cowherds and farmers as the judges is most definitely an unusual event. In fact it is these very differences between the well known debate and the debate in which Siddhasena engages that hold the surest clue to understanding the function of this episode in the biography. The debate with cowherds and farmers as the judges represents a type of comic inversion not uncommon in Indian folk literature, where for example we find fools mistaking a cow shed for the king's palace when they are on their way to present themselves to the king's court to display their imagined talents.26 There is even a story in the Prabandhacintàmani where a princess, who is overly proud of her learning, is punished by marriage to an ignorant cowherd. The cowherd eventually through a boon of the Goddess Kâlï becomes</page><page sequence="20">348 PHYLLIS GRANOFF himself the great poet Kàlïdàsa, in an episode that is full of rich humor.27 Despite frequent assertions that humor in Indian literature does not seek to undermine traditional values or cause a reexamina tion of societal norms, this is exactly its function in the debate to which Siddhasena assents.28 It is significant that in this version of the biography it is Vrddhavàdin who proposes that they permit the cowherds and farmers to stand in the position of learned judges; it is almost as if by this act alone Vrddhavàdin has won the debate, for he has perceived his opponent's weak spot. It is Siddhasena's very pride in his birth and in the trappings of Brahmanical culture that will cause his failure, for it is obvious to Vrddhavàdin as it should be to Siddhasena, that Sanskrit learning will hardly impress these rustics. In addition Vrddhavàdin knows equally well that Siddhasena's committment to Brahmanical culture will lead him to offer them formal arguments in Sanskrit that they cannot comprehend.29 In so doing, of course, Siddhasena is keeping to the conventions of the philosophical debate at the king's court; evidence from the Kharataragacchabrhadgurvávali tells us clearly that a debater was meant to speak correct Sanskrit. Thus Jinapatisüri upbraids the arrogant Padmaprabha who uses Prakrit verb endings instead of correct Sanskrit terminations, and himself so delights those assembled with his Sanskrit, "that their hair stood on end."30 There is a further irony in having the cowherds and farmers stand as judges to the debate, for not only are they uneducated and thus unsuitable to judge any intellectual contest, they are also not usually regarded as paragons of honesty. The Prabhàvakacarita has a telling remark in its biography of Haribhadra. When Haribhadra's disciple, who is locked in combat with a Buddhist, discovers that the Buddhist has in fact been cheating, he hurls at him this abuse: krstijanàdhamâ bhavantah, "You are worse than a farmer", vs. Ill, page 69. The conditions of the debate between Vrddhavàdin and Siddhasena make it a parody of the normal debate: the king's court has become the village field, and the learned judges are now unlet tered villagers, peasants, who even if they had the schooling to comprehend abstruse arguments could not be trusted to hand in an honest verdict. The comic potential of the incident is handled with considerable</page><page sequence="21">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 349 subtlety; where the Prabandhakosa will heighten the mood of hilarity by enlarging upon the story of Vrddhavàdin's own conversion and career as a monk with its more humorous aspects, the Âkhyânaka manikosavrtti retains an air of seriousness. Vrddhavàdin is introduced in typical fashion with due respect, as the "crest-jewel of the host of wise men", and if his boast is ludicrous, it is understandable as the result of that surfeit of pride from which, the narrator informs us, Vrddhavàdin suffers. This is controlled humor, where the narrator is relying on our awareness of the comic inversion operating here to create the comic effects. The initial setting and conditions for the debate do not exhaust the potential for humor or comic inversion in Siddhasena's conversion. Cowherds and farmers as judges is not the only reversal in our debate. The account of this debate violates several other expectations that we have, both from this very story and from general experience with philosophical debates in other Indian literature. It was Vrddhavàdin's initial boast that he would prove in debate even the most impossible of propositions, but it is Siddhasena who sets forth his own position. The challenger has become the challenged in a reversal of the normal rules. Suddhasena's position itself is not surprising; Brahmanical argu ments against the Jain doctrine of an omniscient being are well-known from all periods of Indian philosophy. What is unusual is Vrddhavàdin's reaction to those arguments, and this provides the final reversal. The normal requirements of debate demand that the second debater refute in detail the specific details of the arguments that had been advanced by the first speaker. If we keep in mind that what is on trial here is not a given argument but the whole apparatus of elite Brahmanical culture, then Vrddhavàdin's reaction is fitting, not only as our text tells us, to the occasion of a debate where the courtiers are cowherds and farmers, but also to this hidden proposition. Vrddhavàdin replies not with any counter-arguments, as convention required, but with simple Prakrit verses, which he follows up immediately by a demand to know to whom victory has been awarded. The response of the judges is also a humorous one: using a simple compound that parodies flowery Sanskrit locutions, they rather pompously declare that the words of the Jain monk were as "nectar"</page><page sequence="22">350 PHYLLIS GRANOFF to their ears, tuha padhie sui juyamamaena simciyam amha, vs. 22, a somewhat surprisingly poetic statement for these illiterates. They continue in the second half of that verse with their verdict on Siddhasena, which returns to simple unadorned speech "And we do not understand a thing of what he said", eyassa santiyam puna na kim pi amhe suhàvei. When Vrddhavàdin explains to them the point that Siddhasena has tried to make, they then grab Siddhasena and start to drag him off to the Jain temple to show him the Arhat whose existence he has tried to disprove. Again, the scene is rich in comic potential, the learned Brahmin being bodily carted off by the farmers, and there exists as well the less obvious humor of people arguing at cross-purposes and inhabiting totally different worlds. For Siddhasena surely never meant to imply that there was no statue in the temple of the Jains; he was criticizing the abstract conceptualizations that surround such images. The final irony, of course, is that Siddhasena admits his defeat, proving once and for all that something other than a specific philoso phy was at stake in the debate. What was at stake as we have seen was a world view and a culture, and the laughter we experience at Siddhasena's expense is a laughter directed at the larger group he represents, the dominant intellectual tradition of classical India. The ultimate verdict in the debate, then, is given not only to Vrddhavàdin and the Jains, but also to Prakrit or popular culture, to the world of the cowherds and farmers, whom religion reaches directly through simple poems, and through the performance of miracles. There is a distinctively anti-intellectual tone to all of this. Siddhasena is defeated precisely at that moment when he is doing what he did best in all of his writings: expounding philosophy in the elite and learned tradition of classical India. The image of the monk that we are forming begins to come into focus. Vrddhavàdin is wise but with a wisdom that implies not great book-learning, but rather a sensitivity to the needs of the common people and an awareness of how to deliver religious instruction to its greatest effect. He is also psychologically quite astute, for his suggestion to Siddhasena that they permit the cowherds and farmers to act as judges seals the debate even before it has begun. In his turn Siddhasena, the arrogant Brahmin, employs the tools of his trade with absolutely no effect. In admitting defeat he</page><page sequence="23">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 351 acknowledges the limitations of the elite Brahmin culture. Siddhasena becomes a Jain monk as part of his defeat, with the implication that the Jain monk Siddhasena, like Vrddhavàdin, in his wisdom will espouse something distinct from philosophical learning, philosophical argumentation and skill in Sanskrit. But Siddhasena's ordeal is not quite over; if this is his installation as crown-prince, his actual enthronement must await one more trial. III. SIDDHASENA'S EXILE: THE MONK AS KING Siddhasena is expelled from the Jain community in Ujjain and given a penance that demands that he wander incognito for twelve years before he will be taken back into their fold and thus before he can resume his lawful office in which his teacher had installed him. The exact name of this penance is given in the Prabandhakosa and the Prabhâvakacarita as the páráñcika penance, while the Àkhyânaka manikosa simply calls it the "highest penance", carimapacchittam,31 The páráñcika penance is known from the commentarial literature of the ávetámbaras, and it is a twelve-year period of seclusion that is the maximum penalty under this, the most severe of all penances. It is important to note that there is no mention of any actual concealment of the monk's religious identity during the period in which he must stay away from the group, while such concealment is central to the exile periods of both Siddhasena and Samantabhadra.32 In addition, Siddhasena's penance in his biography also may be seen to bear some resemblance to the accounts we find in the texts on monastic dis cipline, in the fact that it ends with a miracle displayed for a king. The texts describing the penance actually allow for its commutation at the request of a king who has been won over to the monk's cause.33 At the same time, however, Siddhasena's expulsion from the community is given a significant twist, when to the usual punishment of physical separation from the group is added in all versions of his biography the condition that he travel incognito, never revealing that he is a Jain monk. To understand this addition it is necessary to turn from canonical commentaries to the broader category of story literature in India. Such a motif of a twelve-year exile, most often carried out incognito, is standard in stories of kings in classical Indian literature,</page><page sequence="24">352 PHYLLIS GRANOFF and would no doubt have been known to any Indian reader or hearer of Siddhasena's biography, and have added a host of rich associa tions to his story. The exile of the king is a core episode in the Mahàbhàrata and occurs in countless other stories of kings in the epic and the various purànas?A Scholars have interpreted the exile period as a kind of liminal stage in which the king is prepared for kingship, and have noted the association of the twelve-year period of exile with specific rituals associated with kingship in ancient India. For this discussion I would stress particularly that in the majority of these Indian stories of exiled kings there is a close association of exile with sin, usually a sin that is the result of some ritual impurity. Thus in many of the epic and purânic stories in which a king is exiled, the exile serves as a period of expiation rather than as a true rite of passage, and there is no marked change in the character of the king as a result of his exile. He simply emerges from his exile unstained, but without any other major discernible alteration. The period of twelve days is also the time period in the funeral ritual during which the disembodied soul emerges from a dangerous state of limbo and becomes a true pitr, or ancestor, instead of a disembodied ghost who is potentially dangerous to the living.35 During this period the ritual impurities that cluster around death are also removed through the performance of specific rites. Siddhasena's twelve-year exile, then, carries with it a host of associations, all of which revolve around the notion of a dangerous liminal period which involves a temporary loss of identity and after which an individual resumes his true identity. Just as the king during this exile period travels incognito, without revealing that he is a king and devoid of any trappings of royalty, just as the dead soul during his twelve days has no body, no physical identifying features, so it is made a condition that Siddhasena will travel during this period without any of the distinguishing marks of a Jain monk, essentially incognito. Beyond these resonances to many stories of kings in the pan-Indian tradition and resonances to ritual practices, both rituals of royal consecration and funeral rituals, the story of Siddhasena's exile is remarkably close to another story within the Jain tradition itself. This is the story of Samantabhadra, a Digambara Jain, whose biography first appears in the Kathákosa of Prabhàcandra, a Digambara text that</page><page sequence="25">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 353 A. N. Upadhye, its editor, would place in the last half of the eleventh century A.D.36 In fact the Kathákosa story of Samantabhadra's miracle in the Siva temple at Benaras becomes the standard version of Siddhasena's biography. In the Âkhyânakamanikosavrtti as Siddhasena completes his hymns of praise an image of Pàrsvanàtha emerges from the head of the God, making it clear that it is an anthropomorphic image. In the Kathákosa we shall see that Samantabhadra praises the liñga and the liñga splits, revealing an image of the Jain TTrthañkara Candraprabha. This more violent miracle is the one that Siddhasena performs in all the other versions of his biography that are known to me; it happens in all the versions at the temple to Siva in Ujjain, the famous Mahàkàla temple, and it is this more aggressive act that becomes emblematic of Siddhasena. In the Tapàgaccha pattávalis, for example, Siddhasena's name is often cited, despite the fact that he is not considered one of the Tapàgaccha head monks, and after his name there is always some phrase saying that Siddhasena has rent in two the liñga at Mahàkàla and made manifest an image of the Jain ñrthañkara Pàrsvanàtha.37 The close parallel that obtains between the stories of Siddhasena and Samantabhadra is not a unique case; the story of Haribhadra in the ávetámbara tradition, that monk to whose biography Siddhasena's biography shows so many other parallels as we said above, is also intimately related to the Kathákosa story of the famous Digambara philosopher Akalañka.38 What is more difficult to establish in the case of Siddhasena is the relative priority of the accounts.39 Because they both continued to circulate over the succeeding centuries and seem to have been aware of each other, I shall in fact treat them as contem porary and parallel stories, and consider them as each enriching the other by providing resonances and allusions and a deepening context for the exile and miracle that these biographies make so central in their accounts of these two monks. I give now a translation of the biography of Samantabhadra from the Kathákosa of Prabhàcandra. In South Káñci, a certain great sage, the Glorious Samantabhadra by name, who was capable of explaining all the major scientific treatises, from those on logic to those on grammar, and who had carried out many difficult penances and religious observances, was now tormented by an affliction of the digestive system that had arisen</page><page sequence="26">354 PHYLLIS GRANOFF on account of the force of his own grievous past deeds which were such that they led inexorably to his enduring much suffering. In his agony he reflected, "Tormented by this disease I shall not be able to do anything for the Faith. That is why I must certainly find some remedy to still this malady. And there is no other remedy for this sickness besides eating large quantities of rich and tasty delicacies. Since I cannot get such foods here, I must go wherever I can and I must assume whatever guise is necessary in order to get them." With this determination he abandoned the city Káñci and heading north he came to the city Pundra. There he beheld a great hall for public rituals in the outer court of a Buddhist monastery, and thinking, "I will find a remedy for my digestive troubles in this place", he donned the apparel of a Buddhist monk. But because he did not obtain the necessary delicacies there that would cure his sickness, he left that place and heading north once more he wandered through many cities and villages until he came to the city Dasapura. And there he saw a grand monastery of the Vaisnavas which was thronged with crowds of monks bearing the marks of pious Vaisnavas, and these monks feasted on the most delicious foods that were given them by rich donors in deep devotion to their faith every day. He abandoned his Buddhist robes and assumed the guise of a Vaisnava monk. But because he did not get the very rich foods that would cure his digestive troubles there either, he left that place as well and wandering through many districts, towns and villages he came to Benaras. In the course of his wanderings through the city, wearing all the marks of a Saiva ascetic, he beheld the divine temple to Siva that had been made at the command of the King of Kings, the Great King áivakoti, and the temple was filled with eighteen kinds of rich and delicious foods that were being offered to the God. He thought, "Here I shall find a remedy for my digestive troubles." At this very moment it just so happened that he saw the offerings to the God being thrown away after the ceremony had been concluded. He chuckled and said, "Do you mean to say that there is no one here who has the ability to cause the God to come down into our midst and partake of the divine offerings that the King has had prepared with such great devotion?" Hearing these words the temple servants said, "Do you then, sir, have the power to cause the God to come down into our midst, that you</page><page sequence="27">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 355 should speak such words?" And the ascetic replied, "I do indeed." Then the temple servants told the King, "Lord, there is a certain ascetic who, seeing the divine offerings being discarded outside the temple at the end of the worship ceremony to His Majesty's God has said, 'I shall cause the God to come down into our midst and partake of these divine offerings.'" Hearing this the King, his curiosity aroused, took with him the most delectable dishes, all sparkling with large crystals of sugar and dripping with sugar-cane juice, and a hundred pots filled to the brim with curds and ghee, and went there. And then the ascetic was told. "Please, sir, cause the God to partake of this food." Saying, "I shall do just that," he went into the temple, and having cleared the temple of all those present, he shut the door. And as soon as the door was closed in a flash he gobbled up all that food, and when he was done he opened the door and said, "You may take away the empty pots." Now the King was greatly amazed by all of this and so each day he had more and more and richer and richer food prepared and sent to the temple. And when at the end of six months his digestive troubles had been gradually cured and he could eat normal food, then the ascetic no longer ate the food that the King sent. He left it totally untouched. Now the temple servants asked him, "Sir, Lord of ascetics, why does the marvelous meal the King has sent go uneaten?" He said, "The Lord has eaten his fill and is not hungry anymore. Now he is eating only small amounts." The temple servants relayed all this information to the King. And the King stationed a clever fellow by the conduit that carried water and old offerings from the temple and concealed him by covering him up with flower garlands. And that fellow saw the ascetic close the door and eat the food himself. And he told the King, "My Lord, the ascetic does not cause any God to come down into our midst and partake of the offerings. He just closes the door and eats them himself." And when he heard this the King was angry and said, "O ascetic, you have told lies. You do not cause any God to come down into our midst and partake of the offerings. Not at all. You close the door and you eat them yourself. Why, you do not even offer a word of praise to the God." Hearing this the ascetic said, "He would not be able to survive my</page><page sequence="28">356 PHYLLIS GRANOFF words of praise. Only that one who is free from passion and devoid of the eighteen sins could survive my words of praise. That is why I do not praise this God. Were I to praise him, then this God would crack right open." Hearing this the King said, "If he is going to crack wide open then let him crack right open. I order you to praise this God. Let us see your great powers." Then the ascetic said, "Tomorrow at dawn I shall show to you my great powers." And the King, saying, "So be it", threw the ascetic into the temple and had the place carefully guarded by rows of his best warriors, and groups of his elephants. And while the ascetic was desperately worrying, thinking to himself, "I have rashly said something that can never come true. Who knows now what will happen to me," in the second watch of the night the protecting Goddess of the Jain Faith, Ambikâ, sensing his dismay by a trembling in her own divine seat, came there and appeared to him in person. And she said, "O Blessed One, do not worry and be disturbed in your mind. Everything that you said will come true; when you recite the hymn of praise to the twenty-four ñrthañkaras that starts with the words, 'By the One who is Self-existent, who works for the good of all creatures on earth,' it will all take place right before your very eyes." Saying this and rescuing the Blessed One from his troubles, she then vanished. And the Blessed One, filled with joy at having seen the Goddess, composed the hymn to the twenty-four ñrthañkaras, and his mind dancing with bliss, his lotus-face abloom with joy, he spent the rest of the night in supreme happiness. And the next morning at dawn, the King accompanied by all the townspeople, with great curiosity, came to the temple, ordered the temple doors opened and had the ascetic brought out of the temple. And as he came out they all could see that he was delighted at heart, his lotus face was abloom with joy, he was surrounded by an effulgent halo of light, and he radiated strength and power. Now the King thought to himself, "Today this ascetic looks as he never did before. For sure he will carry out his promise." And then the King said, "O Sir, O Lord of Ascetics, I order you to praise this God. Let us see your power." And so the Blessed One began to recite the hymn that began with the words, 'By the One who is Self-existent, who works for the good</page><page sequence="29">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 357 of all creatures on earth'. And as he came to the verse that praises the eighth ürthañkara, Candraprabha, as he recited the words, 'Like the darkness rent asunder by the rays of the enemy of darkness' the liñga split wide open and out of it came a Jain image bearing the likeness of the tirthankaras on all four of its sides. And everyone there shouted out, "Victory! Victory!". And as the King and all the people assembled there were struck with wonder, the King spoke, "O ascetic, who are you with these incredible, wonderful powers, you who bear no obvious marks of your faith?" And then the Blessed One replied with these verses. In Káñcí I was a naked mendicant, my body smeared with dirt; in Làmbusa my body was all white; In Pundrodre I was a Buddhist monk; in the city Dasapura I was a Hindu ascetic who ate fine foods. In Benaras I became an ascetic, my body all white, shining like the moon; O King, whoever has the power, let him come forward and debate with me, the Jain, the follower of the doctrine of those who have freed themselves of their karmic knots. Some time ago I sounded the drum in the middle of the city of Pâtaliputra to challenge to debate whoever might be there; and after that in the country of Màlava, in the land of Sindhu, and in the district of Thakka, in Káñcípura and in Vidisà; now I have come to Karahataka, which is crowded by many who think themselves so wise, fighters all of them; wherever I go I seek a good contest, O Lord of Men; like the meter of these verses, my step is jaunty and springy, like the step of a young panther eager for the hunt. Having said these words, he abandoned his disguise as a Saiva monk, and revealed for all to see the marks of a Jain monk, including the small peacock feather that monks of his Faith were wont to carry. And defeating all those who held that reality was capable of being defined by any one given viewpoint by means of his own doctrine of the multiplicity of viewpoints, he greatly enhanced the prestige and the power of his own Faith. Now in this instance he displayed steadfast and right faith by refusing to praise a false God. And he displayed steadfast and right knowledge by defeating all of those who held to the correctness of single points of view in describing reality. Seeing this great miracle, the King Sivakoti and all of the people there came to have great faith in the Jain doctrine, and all of</page><page sequence="30">358 PHYLLIS GRANOFF them achieved great insight into the true nature of things. And the King became totally discenchanted with worldly power and worldly goods because the particular type of karma that had heretofore obstructed his taking the religious life was exhausted. And he abandoned his kingdom, practiced asceticism, mastered completely all the sacred texts, and then for the sake of those individuals who were either insufficient in intel lectual gifts or who had too short a life-span, he condensed the great work of the teacher Lohàcàrya known as the Àràdhanà and which consisted of 84,000 verses, and composed his Mülárádhaná. which consists of 84 aphorisms and 3,500 verses and begins with the words, 'the sign of an arhat\ This biography of Samantabhadra is as interesting in its own right as the biographies of Siddhasena that I have set out to study. My comments here will be biased by the fact that my prime focus is Siddhasena and the manner in which he has been depicted in the Svetambara tradition; I shall try to restrict my comments to those parts of Samantabhadra's biography that I feel are most instructive for the present study.40 The very existence of this biography is significant to an understanding of the treatment of Siddhasena in the prabandha collections and related texts, first of all because it makes abundantly clear that at least one of the central events in Siddhasena's life after his conversion is not in fact unique to Siddhasena. There existed in medieval Jainism at least from the time of the eleventh century, and if one doubts the dating of the Kathâkosa, then at the latest from the time of the thirteenth century when it is alluded to in an inscription, a common story of a Jain monk who is guilty of a sin and must expiate that sin by travelling incognito.41 At the end of his travels, he proves his purity by displaying miraculous powers. Aided by the protecting Goddess of the faith, he composes a hymn. Through the force of his words he then causes an image of a Jain tïrthàkara to appear, either in a violent shattering of the Sai va Iinga, as in the case of Samantabhadra, or a less violent manifestation from the head of an anthropomorphic image, as in the Âkhyànakamanikosavrtti account of Siddhasena.42 Siddhasena's sin is explicitly named in the Âkhyànakamanikosavrtti; falsely influenced by popular slander of the Jain texts which are written in Prakrit, he offers to rewrite them all into Sanskrit. Samantabhadra's sin is not explicitly named; he is suffering from a disease, and the text makes</page><page sequence="31">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 359 clear that the disease is a result of some bad karma he has accumulated. It is a common notion in Indian religious stories that certain disease are the result of sin. Leprosy, for example, is commonly regarded as the result of gross sin.43 Exactly what happens to Samantabhadra during the course of his journey is also extremely important for us in reading the biography of Siddhasena, for the Âkhyànakamanikosavrtti leaves unstated much of the meaning of Siddhasena's exile, which I have hinted at in my reference to the twelve-year period of exile in other contexts as a liminal journey preparing the individual for the assumption of a heightened role in the community and for the assumption of his true identity. For this reason I should like to focus for a moment on how Samantabhadra's wanderings are treated in the Kathàkosa. The exact nature of Samantabhadra's journey is conveyed with extreme subtlety by Prabhàcandra. Samantabhadra is introduced at the outset of this brief biography by name and with a few simple epithets as is usual at the very beginning of a story, and in precisely the same manner as in the Àkhyànakamaikosavrtti. Thereafter Samantabhadra is referred to only indirectly; even the pronoun is left unstated in the passive verb construction that predominates. Not until he assumes the guise of the Saiva ascetic in Benaras is he again designated specifically. At this point he becomes known as "the ascetic", "yogin", and the reader is alerted to the fact that it is this guise that is especially important in the story and that will lead to the climax, for here at this point Samantabhadra seems to be emerging from a state in which he had only fluid, shifting and marginal identities to one in which we can now begin to localize him with more certainty. Finally, when Samantabhadra, desperate that he will not be able to fulfill his boast of wrecking the liñga by his words of praise, is imprisoned in the temple and visited by the Goddess, we have his final transformation and glorification. No longer the "yogin", no longer just "he", he becomes bhagavàn, "the Blessed One". Samantabhadra, then, starts out in this story with a distinct identity, a name and precise qualities; he undergoes a journey in which he seems basically without precise identity, known only by pronouns, donning and abandoning disguises that are alien to his true nature. He then resumes his true identity as a Jain monk at the conclusion of his journey, but it is clear that some</page><page sequence="32">360 PHYLLIS GRANOFF kind of a transformation has occurred. He is no longer Samantabhadra, the expounder of abstruse treatises, and the practitioner of penances, as we met him at the outset of the story; he is now the Blessed One, the reciter of hymns and the powerful magician, who with his words causes the false God to crumble and the true God to be manifest. It seems at first glance possible that we might conclude that Samantabhadra in his journey has moved in fact from one image of a Jain monk, the monk as scholar and ascetic, to another, the Jain monk as miracle worker and spreader of the faith through his mar velous deeds and charismatic appearance. This is precisely the trans formation that we have seen Siddhasena undergo in his biography. Siddhasena's conversion from the purely scholastic, the purely academic, began with his conversion to Jainism in his debate with Vrddhavàdin. This movement from the elite culture to the world of Prakrit, of verses as opposed to philosophical argument, was only strengthened by the story of Siddhasena's penance and exile and his final apotheosis as hymn-maker and miracle worker. It is tempting to regard Samantabhadra's wanderings as an exact parallel, but I would argue that there is a crucial difference between the two stories and that a consideration of this difference is extremely revealing of what the ávetámbara tradition is doing in its biographies of Siddhasena. Samantabhadra's journey was the reverse of the royal journey in exile in the many stories of kings in Indian literature, for kings move from the city into the wilderness, while Samantabhadra and Siddhasena travel through the cities, which are not the normally sanctioned centers of activity for monks whose natural setting is the wilderness.44 Nevertheless, like those other journeys, it can be understood to involve not a realignment of values, but a reinforcement of clearly existing values, a period of preparation for the assumption of his natural position. There is between the starting point and the finishing point of this journey not a radical change in character, but a gradual revelation of inherent abilities, just as in the case of the young prince who born to kingship goes forth and emerges mature and capable of fulfilling that role. Samantabhadra, after he has become the "Blessed One", still uses his philosophical talents to defeat all the adherents of rival doctrines in debate. He still boasts of his talents as a philosopher and as a debater, in verses that are not entirely appropriate to the</page><page sequence="33">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 361 setting if one concentrates on detail, for they place Samantabhadra in the presence of a king at Karhataka and our story reaches its climax in Benaras, but the verses are neither sloppily nor gratuitously appended here. In fact without these verses the entire saga of the wandering and miracle would be incomplete, for the verses make absolutely clear to us that what has happened in these wanderings is what happens in other such journeys in Indian stories. The hero is prepared to accept the role ordained for him from the start. Samantabhadra began as an intellectual, an expounder of difficult treatises, and he remains an intellectual to the very end. He displays perfect knowledge as well as perfect faith. And in this he is in marked contrast to the Siddhasena of the Àkhyànakamanikosavrtti. The Âkhyânakamanikosavrtti displays a profoundly anti-intellectual tone, as I have repeatedly stressed. Its treatment of the motif of exile and return is best understood as part of a deliberate attempt to create an image of the monk who is not intellectual, but is rather a thorough going populist. If we return for a moment to the text of the Âkhyânak amanikosavrtti, when Siddhasena is about to begin his journey, he too is introduced as learned in all the teachings, sayakasiddhantapàragâmï (vs. 28). At the end of his journey, however, there is no trace of that erudition. Like Samantabhadra he is aided by the presiding Goddess of the faith; like Samantabhadra he composes what the text regards as hymns, but which interestingly enough are often short philosophical treatises, and critical to my point, unlike Samantabhadra after his journey he does not engage in any debates or display the powers of his intellect. This journey has not led to any heightening of inherent powers or to a preparation for a state which at the outset was clearly defined. This journey, like the initial episode of the biography, the debate between the Brahmin Siddhasena and the Jain Vrddhavádin, is a kind of conversion, from intellectual to miracle-worker. The ávetámbara account delicately alters a well-known motif to make a distinct point and create an unambiguous image of Siddhasena, the Jain monk. And that image denies categorically the function of intellectual activity in favour of miracles and the emotive religion of the hymn. The story of Siddhasena, then, in its description of the exile of the monk draws on a theme that has many parallels in the Indian tradi</page><page sequence="34">362 PHYLLIS GRANOFF tion. In this case it exploits this theme by changing it ever so slightly to serve its own ends. The theme of exile and return is employed by the Âkhyànakamanikosavrtti with a twist: the journey is less a period of transition, an opportunity for the maturing of natural tendencies or the removal of some offending and ultimately adventitious sin, than it is a means of conversion and radical change. While it is obviously not possible to prove that readers or hearers of Siddhasena's story were familiar with the story of Samantabhadra, given the close relationship between the Kathâkosa and the ávetárpbara texts in other cases, I find that not an unlikely possibility; in any event readers would surely have been familiar with the exile motif in the lives of famous kings. The biography of Siddhasena depends for its effect on such a familiarity, in that it relies on our awareness of the important changes it makes in the commonly told story of kings in exile who return essentially unchanged but mature enough to assume their thrones.45 In addition to the exile and return motif, both the biography of Samantabhadra and that of Siddhasena use other widely familiar themes and rely on other widely held beliefs to create an image of their subject that is believable and emotionally acceptable. Both rely heavily on universally held beliefs in the power of hymns, and both build on a tradition of miracle stories current in Hinduism and Jainism about extraordinary events that happen around a Saiva image as a result of reciting hymns and prayers to Siva. I would now like to look in brief at these topics to show how rich the context of these stories is and how deeply they are rooted in the pan-Indian tradition. For by employing such common themes these stories create a network of expectations and associations that contribute greatly to their own effectiveness. III. THE POWER OF HYMNS AND THE MIRACLE AT THE LINGA: THE JAIN VERSION Belief in the efficacy of the sacred word is as ancient as is religious speculation in India.46 It is as important in Jainism and Buddhism as it is in Hinduism, and in the medieval period it even led to the develop ment and collection of independent miracle stories that describe the wonders that transpired upon the recitation of a certain verse of a</page><page sequence="35">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 363 certain text. In the Jain context this was most often the verse of a hymn, and we have an entire commentary to the famous hymn, the Bhaktàmarastotra, that is a collection of such miracle tales and is dated 1370 A.D.47 Similarly, from Hinduism we have such collections of miracle stories as the Gïtàmàhàtmya of the Padmapuràna, which relates a miracle story associated with the recitation of each chapter of the Bhagavadgîtà.48 It is instructive to note that in the case of the Gltàmâhàtmya, which is telling stories about a text that the tradition regarded as a philosophical treatise and one of the major sources of scholastic Vedânta philosophy, the miracle stories have absolutely no connection with the actual content of the text. The philosophical content of the text is totally irrelevant to the actual awe in which the text was held and which is conveyed amply by the miracle tales. In the Jain case it is also important to note that there is a criss-crossing of genres between miracle tales and biographies; the biography of Mánatuñga, for example, occurs both in the commentary to the Bhaktàmarastotra as a miracle tale and in the Prabhâvakacarita as a biography. Likewise, the biography of Àryakhapatàcârya appears in a variety of prabandhas and in the Bhaktàmarastotra commentary. It is not surprising, then, to see in the biographies of Samantabhadra and Siddhasena and other famous Jain monks great importance placed on the hymn and the power of the hymn to produce miracles. Biographies and miracle stories of hymns belong very much to the same religious world in medieval Jainism. Beyond drawing on a wide-spread belief in the miraculous powers of hymns, which in itself would have made these stories seem totally credible to a public that shared those beliefs, the emphasis on this motif has yet another function in our stories. The fact that Samantabhadra and Siddhasena perform such a miracle immediately places them in a recognizable context: they are now made members of a whole gallery of famous Jain monks who perform miraculous feats by reciting hymns. If my assumption about the biography of Siddhasena is cor rect, namely that the tradition was attempting through this biography to create an image of a monk that would be widely acceptable and uncontroversial, then surely it would have been useful to create for Siddhasena a community to which he could belong, thereby enabling the hearer or reader of his story to place him in a familiar and congenial</page><page sequence="36">364 PHYLLIS GRANOFF setting. By transforming Siddhasena's texts into miracle-producing hymns, when in fact they were in the main mostly philosophical texts and not hymns at all, the tradition has reinforced its transformation of Siddhasena from philosopher to miracle-worker, locating him squarely among other well-known figures who wrote hymns and performed miracles with them.49 The incongruity of changing the philosopher, who wrote meticulous Sanskrit and extremely difficult, terse and opaque philosophical texts, into the miracle-worker who uses those very texts as magic charms, is in part concealed by this ready famili arity of the context. The transformation is also facilitated by the very nature of the process of telling a miracle story about a text, where we have seen the actual content of the text was always largely irrelevant to its ability to give rise to supernatural feats. Siddhasena as hymn reciter and miracle-worker, then, is in good company and I should like to turn briefly to this company Siddhasena is now allowed to keep to show how his biography can be read as replete with allusions to the deeds of other similar heroes and how it is greatly enhanced by such hints of participating in a larger, common cause.50 Siddhasena is closest to Samantabhadra, as we have seen, but there are also countless other Jains whose stories were well known and who recite hymns and make miracles. There is Mànatunga, the author of the Bhaktàmarastotra, whom I have just mentioned. In addition there is a humorous story told of the monk Bappabhattisüri in the Praband hakosa.51 Bappabhattisüri is locked in debate with the Buddhist Varddhakuñjara. His royal patron tires of the debate and tells the monk to put a hasty end to the proceedings. Bappabhattisüri summons Bhàratï, the Goddess of Knowledge, through a hymn of praise. The Goddess explains to Bappabhattisüri that the Buddhist had praised her over the course of seven births and she had rewarded him for his devotion with a magic pill which makes his arguments unbeatable. The Jain monk then upbraids the Goddess and accuses her of being anti Jain, at which the Goddess relents and tells the monk of a ruse by which he can steal the magic pill from the Buddhist. In return she asks him for a favour: that he not teach anyone the fourteenth stanza of his hymn because she is compelled to appear in person to anyone who recites it. Bappabhattisüri agrees. In the Prabhàvakacarita biography of Abhayadevasüri, the Snake King Dharanendra makes the same</page><page sequence="37">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 365 request and for a similar reason; he is weary of having to appear before wicked mortals, merely because they recite a hymn.51 In the Prabandhakosa, again, the monk Bhadrabàhu also composes a hymn to help relieve the torments caused by Varâhamihira who has become a demi-god, a vyantara, and is tormenting the Jains.53 Similarly a central event in the biography of Âryanandila in the Prabandhakosa is Àryanandila's composition of the Vairothyâstava or hymn to the Snake Goddess Vairothyà, the recitation of which frees people from any threat from snakes.54 There are many other monks in the Svetàmbara tradition who are famed for their hymn-making and the miracles that attend their words. Jinaprabhasüri, for example, is said to have written seven hundred hymns and to have made a vow that he would never eat without first reciting a new hymn to the Jain Goddess Padmâvatï, from whom he believed that he had derived his great wisdom. From the eleventh century onward 3 vet ambara Jains composed hymns in great num bers.55 The pattâvalis of the Tapàgaccha of medieval Gujarat tell of numerous miracles that were the result of the recitation of a hymn. Manadeva averts the plague by reciting a hymn to àântinàtha. The same miracle is also attributed to Munisundarasüri. In fact, most of the monks in these pattâvalis are chiefly remembered for their com position of hymns.56 Samantabhadra and Siddhasena belong clearly to the dominant stream in the medieval Jain tradition when they compose their hymns and use them to perform miracles. The episode of the hymn and its miracle is thus richly allusive, pointing outward from the biography of Siddhasena both to specific stories of Jain monks and to a whole world of popular belief and popular story telling. It remains now to examine the miracle story itself and its equally rich but far more complex ramifications. Magical manifestations at a liñga or an image of Siva occur regularly in the puranic corpus of stories that celebrate particular holy sites and particular religious observances. While an exhaustive study of the miracle stories in the Saiva purânas is beyond the range of this paper, a few of these miracles should be mentioned as background to a more detailed discussion of the Jain appropriation of the theme of the appearance of a God at the liñga in response to the prayers of a pious petitioner.</page><page sequence="38">366 PHYLLIS GRANOFF The Éivapuràna contains a section on the various jyotirliñgas, the most famous Siva liñgas according to this text. The story of the Bhïmesvara liñga, which appears as well in the Jain context makes an appropriate place to start.57 Bhïmesvara is in Kamarüpa, or Assam. A demoness or ràksasï named Karkati has a son named BhTma from the demon Kumbhakarna of Ràmàyana fame. The king of Kamarüpa is an ardent devotee of Siva, but the demon Bhlma defeats him and has him imprisoned. The king continues fervently to worship Siva. He makes an earthen image of Siva to which he addresses his prayers. Now the demon is intent upon destroying Hindu worship, and his conflict with the king of Kamarüpa is in fact a religious war. The Gods are aware of this fact and they all betake themselves to Siva and request that he destroy the demon. Siva instructs the Gods to go at once to the imprisoned king and reassure him that he will destroy the demonic oppressor. In the meantime the demon's followers report to Bhïma that the king is up to something suspicious and that he is always intently worshipping Siva. Bhïma decides to kill the king. There is a brief dialogue between Bhïma and the king, but Bhïma soon tires of talk and raises his sword to strike the image when Siva appears from it and strikes down the weapons that the demon throws at him. A fierce battle ensues, in which the demon is defeated. In commemora tion of his miraculous appearance at that site and the defeat of the demon Bhïma, the Gods ask Siva to remain forever at that place. Such are the origins of the sacred Bhïmesvara. In the éivapuràna account of the origins of the sacred Nàgesvara (chapters 29 and 30), a merchant worships an earthen image of Siva that he has made after he has been imprisoned by a demon. The demon's followers inform him of the merchant's devotions and the demon comes to investigate. The demon orders his minions to slay the merchant, when suddenly an effulgent Siva emerges from a depression in the ground near the image, in full splendour, accompanied by his own heavenly hosts and along with his divine abode. Siva then slays the demon and proclaims the sanctity of the site where the miracle occurred: whoever worships there will become a cakravartin, a world emperor. He then makes a prediction about a particular king, associat ing the powers of the holy site with a well-known specific royal figure, a common feature of these accounts, as I have already noted.</page><page sequence="39">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 367 In the Skandapuràna, Jâtesvaramâhâtmya which belongs to the Avantïkhanda, we learn of a King VTradhanvan whose sins are numerous, from the murder of Brahmins to the slaying of cows. He is advised by the sage Vamadeva to go to the Mahàkâlavana, a place that we shall see is central to all the other accounts of Siddhasena in the Svetâmbara tradition and is in fact the exact location of his miraculous manifestation of a Jain ñrthañkara at a Saiva liñga. There he is told to sing a hymn to the liñga that goes under the name Jâtamahesvara. As he sings his hymn Siva emerges from the midst of the liñga and the king is freed from sin.58 In other accounts of miracles at liñgas or Sai va images the magical manifestation is not an anthropomorphized Siva, but often a myste rious light into which the devotee then merges, achieving his ultimate religious goal and state of perfection, complete union with Siva.59 Sometimes it is flames that shoot out of the liñga and destroy the enemy of the pious devotee, but whatever the exact nature of the manifestation, it seems possible to describe a number of features that these stories have in common and that are relevant in a discussion of the context of the Jain miracles performed by Samantabhadra and Siddhasena. In the majority of these stories the miraculous manifestation of Siva, whether in human form, or as light or flames, occurs as a response to the prayer of a devotee, usually a king. The God then rescues the devotee, either by slaying an enemy or by granting him final salvation and freedom from all of his sins. When we return to the stories of Samantabhadra and Siddhasena, the parallels are clear. Here the Jain ñrthañkara appears in response to prayer, specifically to a hymn; the ñrthañkara by his appearance rescues the devotee from the clutches of an enemy, for both Siddhasena and Samantabhadra by the time they perform their miracle are sorely pressed by the Saiva king whose God they have insulted; at the same time the ñrthañkara also grants the king present final salvation, for the miracle so impresses the king in both our stories that the king converts to Jainism, a sine-qua-non of achieving final salvation. There is of course an obvious difference between the Jain stories of Samantabhadra and Siddhasena that we have been examining and these Saiva stories, and that is that in the Jain accounts the manifesta</page><page sequence="40">368 PHYLLIS GRANOFF tion at the áaiva image or liñga is not Siva at all but the representative of a rival faith and the ultimate result of the miracle is the displace ment of Saivism by Jainism. Thus if the Jain stories carry with them rich resonances of these Hindu miracle tales, in this case both of them have changed a common theme for similar purposes. It is not difficult to imagine the effect created by using a motif so familiar in the world of Indian religious story-telling, with this time a not so subtle change. In fact these two Jain biographies are not isolated examples in the Jain tradition of the use of the theme of a miraculous manifestation at a Saiva holy site, so there are also numerous associations with other Jain stories as well as Hindu stories. I should like now to consider some of these other Jain stories in what follows. Perhaps the story closest to that of the miracle of Samantabhadra and Siddhasena occurs as a minor episode in the biography of the Jain teacher Virasüri, recorded as far as I know only in the Prabhàvakacarita. Virasüri in the course of his wanderings comes to a temple in a village called Sthira (vs. 52). Now there dwells in this temple a demi-god or vyantara named Vallabhïnâtha whose custom it is to take the life of anyone who dares to stop in his temple at night (vs. 53). Virasüri is able to endure all the torments the vyantara has in store for him and finally the vyantara admits defeat. In his amazement at VIrasüri's steadfast and fearless endurance he tells the Jain monk how many divine and mortal creatures have met their end at his hands. His boast includes an account of something that had taken place in the eastern corner of India, in the town of Dakkari at a áaiva temple known as Bhimesvara (vs. 68). There he says he had refused to bow down to the liñga and furthermore had treated it with great contempt by actually sleeping with his feet resting on the water basin that surrounds the liñga. This is in fact exactly what Siddhasena himself does in the brief account of him included in the Puratanaprabandhasamgraha\ it also recalls the contempt with which Àryakhapatàcàrya treats a yaksa in the various accounts of that monk.60 Now the king happens to come to the temple and observing his behaviour is struck with curiosity. He asks the vyantara if he refuses to bow down to the liñga out of ignorance or because he is somehow unable to do so. The vyantara replies that dire consequences might ensue if he bows down to the liñga. The king in disbelief urges him to bow down, which he agrees to</page><page sequence="41">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA 369 do in the presence of all the assembled townspeople. Once they have gathered the action moves swiftly to the expected climax; the liñga cracks wide open when the vyantara performs his obeisance (vs. 77). Overcome by the miracle the king accepts the vyantara as his God (80) as do all the assembled onlookers. The vyantara adds that he bound the liñga with the cloth that he had used to tie his own legs during meditation and that it is still worshipped in that form today (82). Readers of the Prabhàvakacarita could hardly have missed the allusion here to the miracle of Siddhasena. Moreover, since the vyantara as a result of his defeat by VTrasüri becomes an ardent Jain, it seems also possible to appropriate this miracle story for our catalogue of accounts of miracles done by Jains at áaiva temples, and to assume that similarly a reader of Siddhasena's biography, who was familiar with this history of VTrasüri, could hardly have failed to note the coincidences between the two stories. It is difficult indeed not to regard these parallels as deliberate, drawing one story inextricably into another, creating in effect composites as well as individual portraits, and ultimately portraits of the tradition itself as well as its individual representatives. There is another even better known example of a manifestation at a Saiva shrine that redounds to the credit of Jainism and that was no doubt know to every reader or hearer of Siddhasena's miracle at least by the fourteenth century.61 This is the miracle that Hemacandra performs for the benefit of the King Kumárapála. It takes place at the famous S ai va temple of Somesvara and is in response to the King's desire to know the true religion and the path to release. Hemacandra instructs the King to worship the liñga with incense while he himself sinks into deep meditation. From the liñga emerges suddenly a great light and a tiny image of Siva as an ascetic appears at the base of the liñga. The King touches the image and verifies that it is real and not a hallucination; he then hears its advice about the superiority of the Jain doctrine.62 The very same miracle takes place in a story told amongst the followers of the Kharataragaccha of a different monk and king. A King Borad in Ambagadh wants to see Siva in the flesh. The Jain monk Jinadattasüri agrees to help him realize his wish and accom</page><page sequence="42">370 PHYLLIS GRANOFF panies him to a Siva temple, where the monk tells the King to fix his eyes on the liñga. Suddenly smoke begins to bellow out from the liñga and Siva appears before their eyes. Siva asks the King what it is that he wants and the King replies that he wants release. Siva tells him that he can only achieve final release by following the Jain doctrine and so the King converts. The date of his conversion is in fact given in the story as 1059 A.D.63 Finally, the last such record of a manifestation at a liñga belongs not to Jainism, but to Islam. A nineteenth century Gujarati text tells of a Muslim saint causing the liñga at Somesvara to split open, revealing the form of a Muslim ascetic. No doubt, given the rich context that the miracle had in this region, the Muslim text depended for its effective ness at least in part on all the associations it carried with it.64 These accounts of the miracles performed by Jain monks and future Jain devotees at Saiva temples provide a wider context for the stories of Siddhasena.65 Other versions of Siddhasena's biography show a similar network of connections and associations, resonances from the biography of one Jain monk to another, which were in fact essential to the expansion of the biography. Additional incidents only enrich these associations and provide more cross-linkages in the texture of the biography, which depends for its effects on our understandings of these various contexts.66 NOTES 1 The best review of all current scholarship on Siddhasena is to be found in A. N. Upadhye, Siddhasena Divâkara's Nyàyàvatâra, Bombay: Jaina Sahitya Vikasa Mandala, 1971, which includes a bibliographic survey. In his own introduction to this work A. N. Upadhye has argued that Siddhasena belonged to the Yàpanïya Sañgha, a Jain sect that was regarded by both the Digambaras and the Svetâmbaras as heretical. Upadhye further suggested that this was why the traditional Svetàmbara biographies of Siddhasena, which are included in the various prabandha collections and which will be the subject of this paper, never mentioned his main philosophical work, the Sanmatitarka (page xv). It would of course be possible to account for the absence of traditional scholarship on Siddhasena's texts by the same assumption: Siddhasena belonged to a splinter group whose works have been largely lost. I am not entirely convinced by Upadhye's arguments, however; in any case I shall try to establish in this paper that the absence of mention of the Sanmatitarka is better understood as part of a more general denial of Siddhasena's gifts as a philosopher and is perfectly in keeping with the anti-intellectual tone of his biography. I shall further try to under</page><page sequence="43">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA stand this tone in terms of the Svetàmbara community's efforts to create for themselves a self-image that would reach beyond various dividing boundaries and be uncontroversial and readily acceptable to as many fellow Jains as was possible. Such an explanation is more in keeping with the observation that in a commentary to a Svetâmbara canonical text like the Nisithasütra, the Sanmati is mentioned along with the Siddhiviniscaya with much respect as one of the texts that greatly furthers the cause of the Faith. In fact study of these two texts was considered so important that certain restrictions were relaxed in the case of a monk who sought to learn them. See the references to the Nisïthacùrni in Madhu Sen, A Cultural Study of the Nisitha Cùrni. Parsvanatha Vidyashram Series, volume 21, Amritsar: Sohanlal Jaindharma Pracharak Samiti, 1975, page 247, note 19. I would also add that it is not altogether impossible to explain Siddhasena's neglect in part by the difficulty of his texts and his originality; such a situation is possibly not unprecedented in the annals of Indian philosophy. Sri Harsa was recognized by the Vedànta tradition as brilliant and as one of their own. Despite this his main philosophical text, the Khandanakhandakhàdya, remained poorly understood and received relatively little attention from commen tators. See my Philosophy and Argument in Late Vedànta: The Khandanakhanda khâdya of Sri Harsa, Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1978. Finally, it is worth noting that even several hundred years after his death and roughly during the time when many of the versions of his biography achieved their final written form, at least Siddhasena's Nyâyâvatàra, his manual of logic, was mentioned as one of the logic texts that Svetámbara monks studied. Such a reference occurs in the Kharataragacchabrhad gurvávali account of the Kharatara head monk, Jinapati. The text is edited in the Singhi Jain Series by Jinavijava Muni, volume 42, Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1956, and on page 34 we hear of two monks who have studied the Nyâyâvatàra amongst other Jain philosophy texts. Muni Jinavijayaji in his article, "Siddhasena Divákara aur Svâmï Samantabhadra", Jaina Sahitya Samsodhak, vol. 1, part 1, Mahavira Samvat 2446, p. 12, cites a number of commentaries on Siddhasena's works as evidence of the high regard in which Siddhasena was held at least amongst some members of the Svetâmbara community. At the same time, on pp. 10—11, he notes a number of authors who were definitely hostile to Siddhasena for what they viewed as his challenge to orthodoxy. They criticized him particularly for what they saw as his extensive reliance on logical argument as opposed to strict fidelity to the canonical texts. All of this suggests to me that the hostility to Siddhasena the philosopher that I am analyzing in the biographical tradition had deep roots within the ávetámbara community and may reflect a widely held suspicion of creative and original interpretation of revealed texts. I am indebted to the staff of inter-library loan at McMaster University and the L. D. Institute in Ahmedabad for providing me with a copy of Jinaviyaja's article and with much of the other material that I have used in my research. I should also like to acknowledge the assistance of a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada that has enabled me to do my work. The grant, on religious biographies in Asia, is a joint project headed by Dr. Koichi Shinohara at McMaster University and includes Dr. Eva Dargyay from the University of Calgary. I am particularly indebted to Dr. Shinohara for his many insightful comments along the way and to Professor J. R. Hightower who read this paper and made many useful suggestions. 2 In addition to the list of texts that follows, Dr. Charlotte Krause in her article,</page><page sequence="44">PHYLLIS GRANOFF "Siddhasena Divàkara and Vikramàditya", Vikrama Volume, Ujjain: Scindia Oriental Institute, 1948, pp. 213—280, page 217, note 1, lists the following works, none of which is available to me.

To this list of sources could be added Devamürti's Vikramacarita, composed around 1419 A.D. and discussed by H. D. Velankar, "Vikramàditya in the Jain Tradition", in the same Vikrama Volume, pp. 643—645 and 665—666. 3 On the Kahâvali see Dalsukh Malvania, "On Bhadresvara's Kahâvali", Indologica Taurinensia, vol. XIII, 1983, pp. 77—95, and my comments in note 3 to my paper, "The Biographies of Ârya Khapatàcàrya: A Preliminary Investigation Into the Transmission and Adaptation of Biographical Legends", in a volume on religious biography in Asia edited with Dr. Koichi Shinohara to be published by Mosaic Press shortly. This paper on Aryakhapatàcârya deals with the possible relationships between the didactic story collections and the later biography collections or prabandhas, a subject that I will be treating here as well in my discussion of Siddhasena's bio graphies. I have also discussed the relationship between pilgrimage stories, particularly the Vividharirthakalpa, and the biographies of the prabandhas in a paper on Jain biographies of Nâgârjuna included in the same collection. Unfortunately for the present investigation I do not have access to the Kahâvali and its biography of Siddhasena and have only an inadequate summary given in Upadhye, op. cit., page *37. For the other texts cited here I shall be referring to these editions. Prabhàvaka carita, edited Jina Vijaya Muni, Singhi Jain Series, vol. 13, Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1940.

Of these various versions I shall discuss in detail only those from the Àkhydnaka manikosavrtti, Prabandhakosa and Prabhâvakacarita, which are in fact the main texts that give the complete biography. Information about the others will be found dispersed through the body of this paper and in the notes. 4 Vividhatirthakalpa. pp. 88—89; Vikramacarita, Jainistic recension, section VII, page 251—254 in part I, translation. 5 The exception to this statement is the biography in the Prabhâvakacarita, which occurs in chapter 8, "Vrddhavàdicarita", pp. 54—61, and I shall argue that it is the exception that proves the rule. As might be expected from my brief description of this text, the Prabhâvakacarita is a much more intellectually demanding text than the other collections of biographies and stories, and it displays far less hostility to book-learning than the other texts. I shall show later on that by skilful repetition and by careful alterations to certain scenes the Prabhâvakacarita is the only text that actually accepts Siddhasena as a scholar and seems comfortable with the image of the monk as both</page><page sequence="45">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA magician and prominent thinker. I should also like to note here that W. H. McLeod in his Early Sikh Tradition: A Study of the Janam-sakhis, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980, particularly chapter 2, pp. 8—14, has similarly concentrated in his approach to the Sikh hagiographies of Guru Nanak on the image of Guru Nanak, which he prefers to call the "myth", that lies behind the biography, in much the same way I am here trying to seek to identify the image of Siddhasena that emerges from his biography. The "image" or "myth" of Guru Nanak, is however, by comparison to that of Siddhasena unproblematic and readily accessible and comprehensible; that of Siddhasena, going against the impression gained from his works requires considerable thought to understand its rationale and the deliberate process by which it was created. 6 Little work has been done on the various pattàvalis. The Kharataragacchabrhadgur vàvali has been mentioned above, in note 1, and a major collection of the pattàvalis of the tapágaccha has been published under the title Pattàvalisamuccaya, edited by Munidarsanavijaya, Viramgam: Sri Caritra Smaraka Granthamala, 1933. Articles on the pattàvalis include the following. Johannes Klatt, "Extracts from the Historical Records of the Jains", Indian Antiquary, vol. 11, 1882, pp. 245—256. Dasaratha Sarma, "Gleanings from the Kharataragacchapattávali", Indian Historical Quarterly, vol. 26, 1950, pp. 224—231.

Johrapurkar, Jivaraja Jaina Granthamala, no. 8, Sholapur: Gulabchand Hirachand Doshi, 1958, pp. 1—7. All of the various groups with one exception would seem to have placed utmost importance on the correct transmission of the teaching and thus on establishing the pedigree of an unbroken lineage. The one exception seems to have been the Lumpaka, founded in 1452 A.D. which denied any continuous tradition and regarded itself as based simply on written teachings, "kevalapustakamulaka". See A. Weber, "Ueber den Kupaksha kausikaditya des Dharmasagara, Streitschrift eines Orthodoxen Jaina vom Jahre 1573", Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, July 1882, page 807. This document also illustrates clearly how hostile the mutual relationships of these different Svetâmbara groups could be, a point to which we shall return below. 8 My information comes from Muni Uttam Kamal Jain, Jaina Sects and Schools, Delhi: Concept Publishing Company, 1978, pp. 49—75. 9 There is to date no adequate study of the splintering of the medieval ávetámbara community and what actually divided these groups from each other. Muni Uttam Kamal Jain's book cited above, Jaina Sects and Schools, Delhi: Concept Publishing Company, 1978 is useful and some information is contained in S. B. Deo, The History of Jaina Monachism from Inscriptions and Literature, Poona: Deccan College, no title page. There is also a multi-volume history of the Kharataragaccha, the Kharataragac chabrhaditihâsa. I have seen only the first volume of this work which is a translation into Hindi of the Kharataragacchabrhadgurvávali by Mahàmahopadhyàya Vinayasâgara, published in 1959. For information on the same phenomenon among the Digambaras see Bhattâraka Sampradàya, cited above, and Weber's article also cited above. 10 Kharataragacchabrhadgurvávali, page 23, paragraph 45. " Kharataragacchabrhadgurvávali, pp. 20—21, paragraph 40. The text has a lacuna here, but the context makes clear what is happening. 12 "Jñásyate Ràjasabhàyàm. Pasuprâyànam evàranyam ranabhümih", page 21. 13 On the texts about the Vedànta founders and their essentially aggressive tone see my article, "Holy Warriors: A Preliminary Study of Some Biographies of Saints and</page><page sequence="46">PHYLLIS GRANOFF Kings in the Classical Indian Tradition", Journal of Indian Philosophy, 12, 1984, pp. 291—303. Specifically on debate in these texts see my article "Scholars and Wonder workers: Some Remarks on the Role of the Supernatural in Philosophical Contests in Vedànta Hagiographies", Journal of the America Oriental Society, 105/3, July, 1985. 14 On Haribhadra and his debate see my paper "Jain Lives of Haribhadra: An Inquiry into the Sources and the Logic of the Legends", forthcoming in Journal of Indian Philosophy. On the origins of philosophical debate and its agonistic nature see J. C. Heesterman, "On the Origin of the Nàstika", Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde Siid Asiens, 12-13, 1968-69, pp. 171-185. 15 In fact it would seem that debate was almost universally regarded as an aggressive act, even in texts that are not biographies of philosophers. In the Dharmaparîksà of Amitagati, which is dated to 1014 A.D., we have the following description of a debate: vacobhir vâdino 'nyonyam kurvate marmabhedibhih/ yatra vàdam gataksobhá yuddham yodháh sarair iva (chapter 3, vs. 25, edited with Hindi translation by Pandit Balachandra Shastri, Sholapur: Jain Samskrti Samrakshaka Sangha, 1978, Jivaraja Jaina Granthamala volume 32, page 43.) "Where fearless debaters debate with each other, their words deadly sharp and cutting, like so many steadfast warriors wounding each other with arrows meant to deliver a fatal blow." 16 This may be one reason for the anachronistic emphasis in the prabandhas on the Buddhist menace which I explained differently in my paper on Haribhadra cited above. In fact the resurrection of the Buddhist menace even in fiction could have provided a possible rallying point for Svetàmbara Jains who had become more accustomed to fighting amongst themselves. Such a contention is supported by a text like the Kharataragacchabrhadgurvdvali where the Buddhists are nowhere in evidence and the enemy is clearly the rival Jains who live in the temples, the various caityavâsins, against whom the Kharatara monks rose up. 17 I am preparing a study of the Kharataragacchabrhadgurvdvali and hope in the future to be able to discuss its particular conventions and patterns and compare them with those found in the prabandhas. 18 I borrow this term "internally allusive" from Robert Alter in his introduction to The Literary Guide to the Bible, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987, pages 13—14. 19 This is my translation of the text of the Àkhyânakamanikosavrtti, pp. 171—172. As in all the translations done in this paper I have taken certain liberties with the text while I hope not doing violence to its purport. My aim in each case has been to give a reliable translation that yet allows an English reader to appreciate some of the distinctive literary qualities of the biography. What is lost in all of these translations, regrettably, is the effectiveness of the fanciful switching of languages from Prakrit to Sanskrit, which carries with it a host of associations and meanings that are particularly important in these accounts of Siddhasena. I shall rely on my analyses to make these points clear. 20 In fact the question of what language a sacred text might use was debated not only through the medium of biographies such as this one. The Nyâyakumudacandra of Prabhâcandra includes a defense of Prakrit against the non-Jain community, particu larly the Mïmâmsakas, who argue conversely that only texts written in Sanskrit are</page><page sequence="47">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA authoritative and can lead to salvation. See the Nyáyakumudacandra, edited Mahendra Kumar Nyayacharya, Manikchandra Digambara Jain Granthamala, 39, volume 2, Bombay, 1941, pp. 757-767. Buddhists also raised the issue of the propriety of allowing sacred texts to be in Prakrit and came to a conclusion similar to that of the Jains. There is a famous passage in the Cullavagga which in some ways offers a Buddhist parallel to the story of Siddhasena. In my understanding of the passage, two Brahmin converts to Buddhism suggest to the Buddha that his teachings are being distorted as they are told in various local languages. For this reason they offer to put the Buddha's words into Sanskrit. The Buddha replies that they are fools even to conceive of such a thing and tells them that putting his teachings into Sanskrit would constitute a wrong-doing (Cullavagga, Nalanda Devanagari Pali Series, 1956, pp. 228—229). There is a remarkable volume of scholarship on the exact meaning of this passage, which has been much debated by Western scholars. There are also a number of interesting discussions of the use of vernaculars in Buddhism. See for example Lin Li-Kouang, L 'Aide-Memoire de la Vraie Loi, Paris: Adrien Maisonneuve, 1949, chapter 4, pp. 163—228; Etienne Lamotte, Histoire du Bouddhisme Indien, Louvain: Institut Orientaliste, reprinted 1967, pp. 607—618. Most recently the Cullavagga passage has been discussed by John Brough and K. R. Norman in articles in the volume Die Sprache der Àltesten Buddhistischen Überlieferung, edited by Heinz Bechert, Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wissenschaften, Gottingen, 1980. See also Madhav M. Deshpande, Sociolingustic Attitudes in India: An Historical Reconstruction, Ann Arbor, Michigan: Karoma Publishers, Inc., 1979, pp. 40—56. All of these discussions, with the exception of Deshpande, unfortunately neglect the broader philosophical context of the debate over canonical or ritual language in India and I believe that this has led to some distortions in their interpreting the significance of Buddhist comments supporting the use of languages other than Sanskrit and indeed condemning the use of Sanskrit. Thus Lin understands the Cullavagga passage as intending to prohibit the fixing of any single language for Buddhism, ignoring in the final analysis the pointed hostility to Sanskrit displayed by the Chinese vinaya translations that he discusses (p. 225). Norman notes Buddhaghosa's praise of Màgadhï as the root language and the natural language as well as the language best suited for scripture, but he does not make any comment as to why Buddhaghosa might have understood that a scriptural language should also be a root language or a natural language (Norman, pp. 66—69). In fact the Brahmanical/Jain-Buddhist debate over scriptural language helps provide the answer. To the orthodox community only Sanskrit was suited for use in scripture in part because only Sanskrit as the root language was capable of making known its meaning directly. By contrast Prakrits make known their meaning only by indirect reference to this root language of which they are corruptions. In addition the very fact that Prakrits are corruptions of the primary language implies their inferior status and unsuitability for ritual or religious matters. As corruptions they are the result of ignorant misuse of the primary language. To all of this the Jains and Buddhists rejoined that in fact Prakrit is the natural language, the root language of which Sanskrit is the secondary derivative, thus turning the Brahmanical argument against itself. References to the various Buddhist, Jain and Brahmanical arguments are given in the excellent notes to the Nyáyakumudacandra. I have written in more detail on this subject in an article, "Buddhaghosa's Penance and Siddhasena's Crime: Remarks on Some Buddhist and Jain Atitudes Towards the Language of Religious Texts" to be</page><page sequence="48">PHYLLIS GRANOFF published in a Festschrift for Dr. Yiin-hua Jan edited by Dr. Koichi Shinohara and Dr. Gregory Schopen, forthcoming from Mosaic Press, Oakville, Ontario, Canada. Finally I would note that there is a Pali biography of Buddhaghosa, attributed to the Burmese monk Mahàmangala of the thirteenth century A.D., that contains a story of Buddhaghosa that is very much the mirror-image of the Jain account of Siddhasena and his penance. Buddhaghosa must pay for an act of intellectual arrogance by journeying to Ceylon and translating the Buddhist texts that exist there in the vernacular, Sinhalese, into the dialect of Magadha, the Buddhist canonical language. For his part Siddhasena is expelled from the community of monks for proposing that he translate holy books from the vernacular into a canonical language. Buddhaghosa's penance is Siddhasena's crime. See the Buddhaghosuppatti, Or the Historical Romance of the Rise and Career of Buddhaghosa, edited and translated by James Gray, London: Luzac and Company, 1892, chapters 3—7. There are other parallels between this text and well-known Jain biographies. For example, chapter 5 in which Buddhaghosa witnesses an argument between two slave girls is essentially the same story as is told of Sri Harsa in the Prabandhakosa, page 56. I have no concrete evidence that suggests that the Jain text was known to the Buddhist biographers, and at this stage in my research would only propose that such a story might have been commonly told to stress its hero's brilliance and gift with languages. 21 The Prabandhacintâmani of Merutuñga has been edited by Jina Vijaya Muni, Singhi Jain Series, vol. 1, Santiniketan: Singhi Jaina Jnanapitha, 1930 and translated by Tawney, The Prabandhacintâmani or Wishing Stone of Narratives, Calcutta: Asiatic Society, 1901. Much has been written about the association of kings and monks, and the scholarly emphasis has been to understand the close association of kings and monks in religious biographies as a reflection of reality, of the fact that monks sought royal patronage and that kings and monks were essential to each other. This is essentially the thesis behind David Shulman's recent study, The King and the Clown in South Indian Myth and Poetry, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985. See also G. W. Spencer, "Religious Networks and Royal Influence in Eleventh Century South India", Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, vol. 12, 1969, pp. 42—56, particularly page 48. I would prefer to view the frequent appearance of kings in religious biographies as literary devices and to stress the close parallels between religious biographies and other medieval religious tales such as those in the mâhâtmya sections of the major purànas, the Sivapuràna, Skandapuràna and Padmapuràna, for example. Well-known kings also figure prominently in the vratakathâ sections from these purànas, and a collection of late Buddhist vratakathàs, the Vicitrakarnikâvadanoddhrta, preserved in Newari and translated into English by Hans Jorgensen, Oriental Translation Fund, New Series, Vol. XXXI, London: Royal Asiatic Society, 1931, reveals the same phenomenon. I intend to make a detailed study of the way in which people and places are sanctified in stories in medieval India and hope to enlarge upon this idea in the future. 22 This is also true of Buddhist monks in the stories told of them in the Pali commentaries. These stories usually relate the deeds of the group of monks who lived during the time of the historical Buddha Sákyamuni, and the "conversion" scene is almost a type-scene in the sense in which that term is used of repeated episodes in Biblical narrative. The men in these stories, most often of high birth in Brahmin families and highly educated, become converted to Buddhism merely upon seeing the Buddha, whose charismatic presence produces in them a deep religious experience.</page><page sequence="49">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA Sources for these stories include the Manorathapurani on the Añguttaranikáya, the commentaries to the Thera- and Therigàthàs, and the Apadânatthakahà. I borrow the term "type-scene" from Robert Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative, New York: Basic Books, 1981, pp. 49ff to emphasize that this should be regarded as a literary device rather than as a record of actual fact, as is sometimes done. 23 It is central in the case of Haribhadra, for example, whose biographies 1 have studied in an earlier paper cited above. By contrast, in the case of Mallavàdin, the Prabandhakosa simply mentions that Mallavâdin's mother became a Jain and had her son ordained as a Jain monk at the same time (p. 22, vs. 27—28). I have studied Mallavâdin's biographies in my paper on Âryakhapatàcârya cited earlier. In the Praband hakosa (p. 26) Bappabhattasüri's conversion to Jainism forms a central part of his story, and takes place during his exile in an experience which brings him very close to his future royal patron. While a detailed comparison of how conversion is treated in the Jain prabandhas is beyond the scope of this paper, I would note that the conversion is often not necessarily described as the result of a deep religious experience. Often it is as we see it for Siddhasena, the result of the fulfillment of a rash and hasty promise. 24 In fact this bizarre behaviour is not confined to Haribhadra. In the Prabandhakosa biography of the Digambara Madanakirti, the arrogant Madanakirti, armed with a spade, a net, and a ladder, and a host of disciples, sets out for the South against the explicit advice of his teacher in search of rival philosophers to defeat in debate (page 64). I would definitely consider the mention of Madanakirti's equipment as an explicit allusion to the behaviour of the arrogant Brahmin Haribhadra. This must be seen as another example of the use of allusion as a kind of cross-referencing system which ultimately serves to build in the reader's mind a recognizable class of persons or objects. In this case the man who carries a ladder, spade, and net is identified at once as overweening, wrong-headed, and destined for a fall. I am in the process of translating the biography of Madanakirti along with other biographies from the Prabandhakosa for a special volume that I am editing for the Journal of South Asian Literature, which will be devoted to Jain narrative literature. 25 See my paper on Haribhadra cited above for details. 26 So in a story of three foolish brothers retold in the Bengali Satabarser Rûpakathà, edited Malayasankar Dasgupta, Calcutta: Book Trust, 1983, "Hattamâlàr Dese", by Kartikacandra Dasgupta, pp. 97—106. 27 The story is the second episode in the cycle of Vikramàditya tales. It is discussed by Toshikazu Arai, "Jaina Kingship as Viewed in the Prabandhacintamani", in Kingship and Authority in South Asia, edited by J. F. Richards, Madison: University of Wisconsin, South Asian Studies, 1978, pp. 80—81. Arai notes the anti-Brahmanical tone of the story and also raises the larger issue in his article of the Jain disdain for the elite Sanskritized culture of the royal court in general. I am somewhat less convinced by this overall argument; certainly such an attitude is not markedly in evidence in the Prabandhakosa and the Prabhâvakacarita. 28 On the general topic of humor in Indian literature see David Shulman, The King and the Clown, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985, particularly chapter IV. See also Keith N. Jefferies, "Vidüsaka Versus Fool" Journal of South Asian Literature, vol. 16, 1981, pp. 61-73. 29 In the Prabandhakosa account of Siddhasena, p. 16, it is Siddhasena who suggests that the cowherds be the judges. In the Prabhâvakacarita account, biography 8, vs. 44,</page><page sequence="50">PHYLLIS GRANOFF page 55 it is Vrddhavàdin who makes the cowherds the judges but only under duress. Siddhasena refuses to wait to conduct the debate in a proper place and Vrddhavàdin is left no choice but to permit the debate to be conducted in such an unusual place and under such unusual circumstances. 30 Kharataragacchabrhadgurvàvali, page 26, paragraph 48. 31 Àkhyànakamanikosa, page 172, verse 35; Prabandhakosa, page 18, line 19; Prabhávakacarita, page 58, verse 118. 32 My information comes from S. B. Deo, History of Jaina Monachism, thesis approved for the Ph.D. at the University of Bombay, 1952, published by the Deccan College, Poona. My edition lacks the title page and exact details of publication. The discussion of the páráñcika penance appears on pp. 377—380 and is taken mainly from the Brhatkalpabhàsya, V, 5135—37, a text that is unfortunately not available to me. The comparison of Siddhasena's penance with that described in the bhàsya raises the very interesting issue of the extent to which the behaviour of monks described in the prabandha biographies corresponds with the rules laid down for them in the canonical texts and their commentaries. It was, for example, forbidden for a monk to study at night (See Deo, p. 313). Nonetheless, in the Prabandhakosa account of Siddhasena we shall see Vrddhavàdin keeping his fellow monks awake all night with his loud recitations. I hope some day to study this question in detail. 33 This is in fact what happens in the Prabhávakacarita. See page 58, verse 119 where he is told that if he does something extraordinary in service of the faith the punishment will be commuted, and verse 121, where we are told that seven years out of the twelve have passed when he comes to Ujjayinï. 34 On the exile of the king for twelve years see David Shulman, The King and the Clown, cited above, particularly chapter V. See also Wendy O'Flaherty, Dreams, Illusions and Other Realities, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1987, chapter 4. Both these scholars tend to stress the transformative powers of the period of exile; I shall place a different emphasis in my own analysis of the role of exile in most of these Indian stories of exiled kings, stressing the function of the exile as an expiatory period, much like the expiatory journey of the Gods Brahmà and Siva, who in a variety of stories in the purânas must undertake such journeys to remove major sins. It is certainly the case that among famous royal exiles Hariscandra, the Pândava brothers, and Nala have all committed ritual infractions. I use the term "liminal" in my discussion in loose borrowing from Victor Turner's many writings to underscore the fact that during the exile period normal rules are suspended, normal identifying marks are erased and striking reversals of status may occur. I feel that in the Indian exile stories for the most part the "liminal" stage is less a part of a rite of passage than a distinctively defined period of ritual expiation, and I recognize that the word "liminal" may carry associations that do not entirely apply in the cases I am handling. Nonetheless I find the term useful for discussion. 35 See Jonathan Parry, "Ghosts, Greed and Sin: The Occupational Identity of the Benaras Funeral Priests", Man, new series, volume 15, 1980, p. 91. 36 Published in the Manikcandra Digambara Jaina Granthamala, no. 55, Bombay: Bharatiya Jnanapitha, 1974. Upadhye's discussion of the date is on page 28 of the English introduction. The story of Samantabhadra is pp. 8—10, story number 3. The most detailed discussion of this biography of Samantabhadra is to be found in an essay by Jugalkishor Mukhtar in Hindi that has been published in his edition of the Ratnakarandasràvakàcàra, Manikcandra Digambara Jain Granthamala, 24, Bombay:</page><page sequence="51">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA Bharatiya Vidya Pitha, 1926. In his article, "Siddhasena Divâkara Aur Svàmï Samantabhadra", cited in note 1, Muni Jinavijaya draws a number of close parallels between the position of Siddhasena within the Svetâmbara tradition and that of Samantabhadra among the Digambaras. Both were the first in their respective commu nities to write in Sanskrit; both were the first to use logic and the tools of the Brahmanical intellectual tradition to justify Jain doctrines. See pp. 13—14. Muni Jinavijaya also notes that the ávetambaras and Digambaras valued both men equally for their accomplishments and bestowed on them the same honorific epithets (p. 20). 37 See the Srïpattàvalisamuccaya, edited Munidars'anavijaya, published in Viramgam by the Sricaritrasmarakagranthamala, 1933, page 46. 38 See my paper on Haribhadra cited above. 39 Mukhtar believed that the Kathàkosa story of Samantabhadra and a reference to it contained in an inscription at Candragiri near Sravan Belgola that is dated 1128 A.D., and that in fact includes the verses that close the Kathàkosa story, predated by a considerable span of time the first appearance of the story of Siddhasena. The inscription can be found in Jainasilàlekhasamgraha, part 1, edited Hiralal Jain in the Manikacandra Digambara Jaina Granthamala, vol. 28, Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Pitha, n.d., no. 54, page 102. Mukhtar was not aware of the story of Siddhasena in the Âkhyânakamanikosavrtti, which was unpublished at the time in which he was writing, and which dates to the mid-twelfth century A.D. The Âkhyânakamanikosavrtti indicates that the story of Siddhasena was known at least by the mid-twelfth century A.D.; it is thus no longer possible to agree with Mukhtar that the biography of Samantabhadra predates that of Siddhasena by such a long period of time. In addition, because of the problems of dating the Kathàkosa and the inherent difficulty of assuming that the particular date of a written text implies the first occurrence of a story that might very well have circulated orally, I would prefer not to deal with the relationship between the biography of Samantabhadra in the Kathàkosa and the biography of Siddhasena as an historical question. On the grounds of internal consistency there is reason to find the biography of Samantabhadra a more tightly organized and coherent text; the verse which causes the lihga to split is perfectly appropriate to the task, talking about the rending of darkness bringing about the rending of the false God. This seems, however, not quite sufficient grounds on which to argue for the priority of Samantabhadra's story over that of Siddhasena. In any case, there is no doubt that as time progressed the Digambara story was greatly influenced by the ávetambara story of Siddhasena and other stories of similar miracles that are recorded in the prabandhas. The Kannada Rájávalikathe which Mukhtar summarizes has the monastic community decree the punishment as in the story of Siddhasena current in the Svetambara tradition, and locates the miracle in a temple called Bhimesvara, the name of the temple where we shall see a demi-god or vyantara perform a related miracle in the Prabhàvakacarita (see the biography of Virasuri, number 15, page 130, vs. 88ff). It also corresponds to a folk tradition preserved in Gujarat which also tells of a cracked litiga. The folk story comes from a place called Bhimnath and tells of how Bhïma tried to fool the pious Arjuna by having him worship at the wrong place. He makes a bogus "God" for Arjuna, a pot of leaves, and when he wants to show that Arjuna's worship was in vain he strikes the pot; but miraculously milk flows out of it. There is a lihga underneath the pot and it is cracked from the blow. See Brenda Beck, Peter J. Claus, Praphulladatta Goswami and Kawahrlal Handoo, Folktales of India, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987,</page><page sequence="52">PHYLLIS GRANOFF tale no. 93, collected in 1948. The Ràjàvalikathe seems also to have assimilated certain elements from the story of Hemacandra's conversion of the king Kumârapâla that was popular in the Svetàmbara community and which I shall also be discussing later in this paper. In the Ràjàvalikathe Samantabhadra does not cause the liñga to break. His stare causes the tïrthànkara to materialize at the liñga, much as Hemacandra causes a tiny figure of Siva to appear at the base of the liñga for King Kumârapâla. For details of Kumârapâla's conversion see G. Buhler, The Life of Hemacandràcârya, Singhi Jain Series, no. 11, English translation by Dr. Manllal Patel, Saniniketan: Singhi Jaina Jnanapitha, 1936, chapters 5—7. 411 In his detailed analysis of this biography that I cited above from the Ratnakarandasrà vakàcàra, Mukhtar follows the difficult path of trying to ascertain from the traditional accounts the exact events of Samantabhadra's life. Mukhtar found problematic the biography in the Kathàkosa, which he knew in detail from its later, sixteenth century summary by Brahmanemidatta. Some of the points that troubled Mukhtar are the very points at which this biography diverges from the Svetàmbara biography of Siddhasena, and which are told differently in the later Kannada Ràjàvalikathe, as Mukhtar noted and I have indicated in the previous note. These include the fact that Samantabhadra himself in this account decides to seek a cure for his sickness, when Jain monks should be indifferent to the body and should refuse medicine. Given the fact that the focus of Mukhtar's analysis was to determine the actual events in the life of Samantabhadra and that he started from the assumption that Samantabhadra was an exemplary monk, because he found Samantabhadra's action in this biography to be contradictory to the principles that ought to have governed the life of a monk, he then went on to discount its historicity. He preferred the later account in which the monastic community orders Samantabhadra to find a cure for his illness. Mukhtar also found difficult the fact that Samantabhadra in this account goes north, not finding the rich foods he needs in the south. He again preferred the Kannada account which set the miracle in Káñcl. In a similar vein Mukhter analyzed the miracle itself, preferring the less violent version of the Kannada text to the Kathàkosa version that I have translated here. Mukhtar's analysis is thus motivated by his deep regard for Samantabhadra, and his conclusions endorsing the historicity of the latest account of the monk's life with its likely late borrowings from the ávetámbara stories are unacceptable to me. Nonetheless his article is invaluable in the information it contains about Samantabhadra from inscriptions and in the citations from various Jain texts which illustrate the high regard in which Samantabhadra was held in the Digambara tradition. There has also been some work done on Sivakoti, his identity and his relationship to Samantabhadra. Sivakoti is known as the author of the Mulàradhanà, but the veteran scholar Nathuram Premi in his article, "Àrâdhanà aur uskï Tïkâye", included in the volume, Jaina Éáhitya aur Itihàsa, Bombay: Hemacandra Modhi, 1942, pp. 23— 41, explicitly denied any possible connection between this Sivakoti and Samantabhadra. Premi also expressed the opinion that the story of Samantabhadra probably did not makes its appearance much before the Kathàkosa of Prabhâcandra. He based this on the observation that the story is unknown to Harisena who wrote his Brhatkathàkôsa in 932 A.D. Finally, Premi identified Sivakoti as a member of the Yàpanïya samgha, the splinter group regarded by both Digambaras and Svetàmbaras as heretical and to which Upadhye suggested that Siddhasena himself belonged, in his introduction to his edition of the Nyàyàvatàra cited above. It is tempting to see in the closely related</page><page sequence="53">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA stories of Samantabhadra and Siddhasena a lost Yàpanïya tradition; Karahataka, named in the verse at the end of Samantabhadra's biography in the Kathàkosa is considered by some scholars to have been the centre of the Yàpanïya movement. The Yâpanîyas also seem to have been particularly devoted to the Tirthañkara Pàrsvanàtha who figures prominently in the biographies of Siddhasena. In addition the Yâpanîyas were also called "gopya" or "concealed", a title that would fit in aptly with both Samantabhadra and Siddhasena in their traditional biographies where they travel incognito. Unfortunately there is nothing substantial to support such an hypothesis, as attractive as it would be to discover remnants of a lost tradition, and it would be rash at this point to attempt to develop it further. Information on the Yâpanîyas is found in another article by Nathuram Premi included in Jaina Sáhitya aur Itihâsa, entitled "Yàpanïya Sàhityakï Khoj", pp. 41—61. See also A. N. Upadhye, "Yàpanïya Samgha: A Jain Sect", Journal of the University of Bombay, vol. 1 issue vi, 1933, pp. 224—231 and "More Light on the Yàpanïya Samgha: A Jain Sect", Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, vol. 54—55, 1973—1974, pp. 9—22. The information on the devotion to Pàrsvanàtha comes from "More Light", p. 18. On the term gopya see Premi, "Yàpanïya Sàhitya", p. 41. Karahatak is the centre of the Yâpanîyas according to the Digambara accounts of this group which are published by H. Jacobi, "Über die Entstehung der Svetâmbara und Digambara Sekten," Zeitschrift fiir die Deutsche Morgenlands Gesselschaft, vol. 38, 1884, pp. 1—42. There is an inscription at Vindhyagiri dated 1398 A.D. that knows Sivakoti as the disciple of Samantabhadra. See Jainasilàlekhasamgraha, part 1, edited Hiralal Jain, Manikcandra Digambara Granthamala vol. 28, Bombay, n.d., page 198, inscription number 105. Given its late date it is more likely an indication of the popularity of the tradition transmitted in the biography of Samantabhadra than any concrete support of an actual historical relationship between these two men. I would prefer to understand the presence of the King Sivakoti in the story as another example of a literary device that is common in Indian religious story-telling, particularly in those stories that tell of the efficacy or sanctity of a particular religious observance, or a particular holy place, or relate the deeds of a man whose holiness is being established. In these stories, as I have mentioned earlier in this paper, a well known king regularly occurs in an intimate connection with either place, ritual or monk. If we accept that the conventions demanded that a king be influenced or in some way affected by a holy man in the account of the holy man's deeds, then the question of whether or not there is any evidence that a King Sivakoti was converted by Samantabhadra is neither a significant nor appropriate focus of further investigation. 41 On this inscription see the information contained in note 26. 42 The importance of violence in the sanctification of a holy site and the role of the violent wounding of the God in establishing a holy place, particularly the wounding of the liñga, are central themes in South Indian accounts of the origins of holy sites. It is tempting to regard the Kathàkosa account of the South Indian Digambara monk Samantabhadra's splitting the liñga as reflecting Southern notions of the sanctifying force of wounding the God as opposed to the Northern Àkhyánakamanikosa account, in which there is no violence involved in the manifestation of the Tïrthankara. On the South Indian tradition of the wounded God see David Shulman, Tamil Temple Myths: Sacrifice and Divine Marriage in the South Indian Saiva Tradition, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980, chapter III, section 2, "Milk, Blood, and Seed", pp. 93-110.</page><page sequence="54">PHYLLIS GRANOFF 4-1 See the many stories in the Skandapuràna, Tàpïkhanda, which is a history of the Nagar Brahmins of Gujarat. In particular I would cite chapters 45, where the King of Ânarta, Brhadbala, is stricken with leprosy when he tries to steal a magic lotus from a lake; chapter 83, where the wicked Kung Venu contracts leprosy as a result of all his wickedness, and chapter 32 where it is directly stated that leprosy is the result of killing a Brahmin in a previous life. King Ambarisa has a son in this chapter who has leprosy and is cured by holy water in answer to his father's prayers. Given the strongly Brahmanical bias of this text it is not at all surprising to see absolute evil equated in this way with taking the life of a Brahmin. 44 On kings and wilderness see the many comments in Shulman's book cited above and see as well, Nancy Falk, "Wilderness and Kingship in Ancient South Asia", History of Religions, vol. 13, August 1973, number 1, pp. 1—15. 45 On the relationship between the Kathàkosa and the Svetàmbara biographies see my paper on Haribhadra cited above. See also notes 36 and 39 on the Digambara assimilation of Svetambara stories in the later biography of Samantabhadra in the Kañnada Râjâvalikathe. 46 It is the stock-in-trade of the Bràhmanas and lies behind all of Tantric worship with its emphasis on the recitation of mantras or sacred formulas. On the Bràhmanas see Wendy O'Flaherty, Tales of Sex and Violence: Folklore, Sacrifice and Danger in the Jaiminiya Bràhmana, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1987, first published by the University of Chicago Press 1985. On the power of the Rg-Vedic hymns see the references contained in J. Muir, "On the Relations of the Priest to the Other Classes of Indian Society in the Vedic Age", Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. 2, new series, 1866, pp. 252—302. 47 The text is edited by Professor Hiralal Rasikdas Kapadia in the Sheth Devchand Lalbhai Pustakoddhara Fund Series, no. 79, Bombay, 1932. I have taken the date from the Jinaratnakosa of Hari Damodar Velankar, Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, 1944, p. 287. I have discussed this text briefly in my paper on Arya Khapatâcàrya cited above and drawn attention to the close connection between these miracle stories and the biographies in the prabandha collections. There are many other such collections of miracle tales associated with the Bhaktámarastotra. Some are listed by Kamalkumar Jaina Shastri in his Citrabhaktàmararahasya, Delhi: Sri Kunthusagara Svadhyay Sadana Prakashan, 1977, p. 48. 48 Padmapurána, Uttarakhanda, chapters 171—188 in the Anandasrama Sanskrit Series, volume 131. 49 The traditiion also attributed the Kalyánamandirastotra, another famous Jain hymn, to Siddhasena. Modern scholars discount this attribution and the fact remains that a text like the Âkhyànakamanikosavrtti is using Siddhasena's Dvàtrimsikàs, his brief compositions of thirty-two verses which are in the main not hymns at all, as hymns. On these texts and on the attribution of the Kalyánamandirastotra to Siddhasena see Upadhye in his introduction to the Nyàyàvatàra cited above and particularly the bibliographical essay that he has provided. 50 It is worth pausing to note that the transformation of philosopher to miracle worker, accomplished by turning philosophical text into magical formula, may in fact reveal a significant and unusual attitude towards books in general which is consistent with the overall anti-intellectual tone of these biographies. In the main, the prabandha collections tend to regard books as magical objects with supernatural powers, very much as the Padmapurána treats the Gità. Books are dangerous, and Gods or</page><page sequence="55">THE BIOGRAPHIES OF SIDDHASENA Goddesses often reclaim them from unworthy mortals who would trifle with them, as in the biographies of Mallavàdin, Siddhasena, Àrya Khapatàcârya and Haribhadra. This forms a striking contrast with the respect for books not as dangerous magical devices, but as records of learning and repositories of authoritative proof for sectarian doctrines, an attitude which marks a text like the Kharataragacchabrhadgurvâvali, that distinctly sectarian collection of the biographies of the leading monks in the Kharatara branch of the Svetâmbaras. To the Kharatara monks books are essential; no philo sophical debate can be held without a book, nor can monks even preach without a book to read from, as is clear in the biography of Jinesvara, pp. 1—8. In addition, rival monks seek to thwart the Kharatara monks by denying them access to books, and lay devotees are encouraged to spend money having texts committed to writing (biography of Abhayadeva, page 8) in contrast to the situation in the prabandhas, where wealthy lay devotees are urged to use their funds in the restoration of images and temples (the biography of Jívadevasüri, Prabandhakosa, pp. 7—9, is but one example). Even divine messages may be conveyed in the Kharatara text in writing, rather than in sleep or through the direct appearance of the Gods as in the prabandhas (Jinesvara and the message from Marudevigani, pp. 5—6). I suspect that this attitude of the Kharatara biographies towards books and the written word is closely connected with their avowedly sectarian nature, and that the transformation of disputatious text into a magical object that occurs in the prabandhas may be further evidence that supports the hypothesis I am seeking to establish in this paper, namely that in the prabandhas we see a deliberate effort to avoid points of conflict and create images that appeal to all members of the wider community, beyond local and sectarian divisions. 51 Page 36. 52 Prabhdvakacarita, page 166, verse 166. 53 See page 4. 54 Page 7. 55 See the volume Jaina Hymns, Bombay: Shri Yasobharati Jain Prakashan, 1975, and its lengthy Hindi introduction on hymns in Jainism by Dr. Rudradeva Tripathi. 56 See the Pattàvalisamuccaya cited above, particularly pages 26, 40, 60. 57 Sivapuràna, chapter 20, p. 710 in the edition of Ramatejashastri, Kasi: Panditapus takalaya, n.d. The Jain parallel is in the Prabhdvakacarita story of VTrasüri, biography number 15, pp. 127—132. I shall return to it in some detail below. 58 Skandapuràna, Avantïkhanda, chapter 28, volume 5, pp. 325—330. 59 This seems to be particularly common in the miracle stories in the Skandapuràna, while the Sivapuràna tends to favour the direct appearance of the God in human form. See for example Kàsïkhanda, chapter 73, vs. 97, and chapter 25 in the Avantïkhanda, where such a magical appearance of light occurs twice in the story. I am using the Calcutta edition edited in the Gurumandal Series, published in the 1960s. 60 Puràtanaprabandhasamgraha, page 10. On Àryakhapata see my book cited earlier for references to the texts. 61 Despite the fact that it is somewhat anachronistic to consider this here in a discussion that has been based on the account of Siddhasena in the twelfth century Âkhyànakamanikosavrtti, 1 do so for the sake of completeness. My information that the miracle Hemacandra performs to convert King Kumârapàla is not known before this time comes from the remarks made by Buhler in his volume on Hemacandra</page><page sequence="56">PHYLLIS GRANOFF which I have cited above. The Prabhàvakacarita which was written in 1277 does not relate the miracle. It is known to the fourteenth century Prabandhacintàmani and the Kumàrapàlacarita of Jinamandana, the date of which according to the Jinaratnakosa is 1436 A.D. 62 This is not the only instance in Jain religious biographies where Siva himself appears to an individual and is instrumental in leading him to accept the greatness of Jainism. This is a major theme in the biographies of Jinesvara. See Jina Vijaya Muni's detailed Hindi introduction to his edition of Jinesvara's Kathàkosaprakarana, Singhi Jain Series, vol. 11, Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1949. 61 The story is published by Agarchand and Bhanwarlai Nahta in the Hindi book Kharataragacchapratibodhita Gotra aur Jàtiyàm, Calcutta: Sri Jinadatta Sevasamgraha, V.S. 2000, p. 44. 64 For the account see Major J. W. Watson, "The Fall of Patan Somanatha", Indian Antiquary, vol. 8, 1879, pp. 153—162. 65 I restrict my comments to Siddhasena, since his biographies belong to the Svetàmbara tradition and it is safe to assume that these other stories belonging to the same tradition and often told in the same or in closely related texts would have been known to those who heard his biography. 66 My emphasis in the sections that follow will not be on the historical development of the biography. While this is in itself an interesting question, the evidence I have at my disposal does not permit a strict historical analysis. The Kahâvali of Bhadresvara, which is said to belong to the twelfth century A.D., and is thus contemporary to the Àkhyânakamanikosavrtti, is unavailable to me, as are several other important sources that I have cited in note 2 above. From the inadequate summary of the Kahâvali that I have from Upadhye's bibliographical essay in his edition of the Nyàyâvatâra cited above, note 1, it would seem that the Kahâvali already includes several episodes that do not appear in the Âkhyânakamanikosavrtti but that do appear in the later prabandha collections. These are Siddhasena's anticipating the greeting of the king and offering him a blessing, despite the fact that the king has not openly welcomed the monk, and his assisting a king with soldiers and money. See Upadhye, page *37. In addition, the Visesaciimi to the Nisithasütra, composed in 676 A.D. by Jinadâsagani Mahattara, mentions in passing that Siddhasena studied texts like the Yonipràbhrtaka and obtained from them the ability to produce magic horses. I found this reference first in Charlotte Krause's aricle "Siddhasena Divàkara and Vikramàditya", page 228, cited in note 2. The actual line in question may be found in the edition of the ciirni published in the Agama Sahitya Ratnamala, no. 4, edited by Shri Amar Chandji Maharaj, Delhi: Bharatiya Vidya Prakashan, 1982, volume 2, p. 281. A Siddhasena Ksamâs'ramana is often mentioned in the Nisitha as a commentator on the Niryukti verses. It is generally accepted that this is a different Siddhasena from Siddhasena Divàkara, whose traditional biographies are the subject of this paper. On this point see Madhu Sen, A Cultural Study of the Nisitha Ciirni, Parsvanatha Vidyashrama Series, volume 21, Amritsar: Sohanlal Jaindharma Pracharak Samiti, 1975, p. 3, note 4, citing the opinion of Dalsukh Malvania.</page></plain_text>
