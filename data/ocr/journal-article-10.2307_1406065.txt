<plain_text><page sequence="1">LION, LAMB AND LETTUCE John Passmore: Man's Responsibility for Nature: Ecological Problems and Western Traditions. (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1974. Pp. 206, index. $7.95.) It is a thing charged with terror that nature, which once was responsible for man, has now fallen into her dotage and must be looked after by her erstwhile dependent. Evolution, having produced the cerebral cortex, now appears to have abdicated any further respon- sibility for the course of events. Yet it is as if, to paraphrase Samuel Butler, the cerebral cortex were only nature's way of making a second nature. In rummaging about through the set pieces of the ecological reper- toire, John Passmore has produced a thoughtful and thought-pro- voking work. He holds that our Western traditions, a least the secular ones, are broad and deep enough to allow for the incorporation of an ecological ethic without serious strain. We need not adopt Zen or peyote to insure an indefinite and meaningful future for man on this earth. But distinctions are necessary here. Despite grave reservations about the Stoic-Christian ethic, Passmore finds our moral traditions in the West capable of being reworked in light of our emerging sense of responsibility for the biosphere. But our metaphysical traditions, at least the Christian metaphysical tradition, are another matter. "Only if men see themselves . . . for what they are," Passmore writes in a final chapter entitled "Removing the Rubbish," "quite alone, with no one to help them except their fellow-men, products of natural processes which are wholly indifferent to their survival, will they face their ecological problems in their full implications. Not by the exten- sion, but by the total rejection, of the concept of the sacred will they move towards that sombre realisation" (p. 184). Thus, the Christian metaphysical position that man is unique is part of the rubbish that must be removed if we are to survive. "What is ecologically dangerous in Christianity," he writes, "is not that it denies the sacredness of nature, but that it encourages men to believe that they are 'sons of God' and therefore secure, their con- tinued existence on earth guaranteed by God. So far it encourages hubris; it makes of nature something which can be ravaged with impunity. Man, it must certainly be recognized, has no tenure in the biosphere" (p. 184). A host of questions arise at this point, and one hardly knows in</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 565 what order they ought to be asked. What would man be with this higher pessimism that is preached, with God long dead and nature now following Him to the tomb, with civilization secularized, and with his near-timeless project of extrapolating onto nature his own moral expectations? Or, again, just what is the difference between being "unique," and being "quite alone" in the universe? What sort of a process would evolution be if it could produce a species which was quite alone, somehow qualitatively unrelated to other species? Further, one might ask how Christianity, with its linear conception of time moving from genesis to apocalypse, should have come to be seen as giving man the sense that his continued existence on earth was guar- anteed by God. An apocalyptic view of time and nature would be no more attractive to most ecologists, but it might be more accurate. One suspects that the God of the Old Testament has been singled out here as spokesman for Christianity; and one hears echoes of Teilhardian optimism. But it could be argued that such anthropomorphic optimism is heterodox mystical rubbish and indeed, then, something to be swept away. There is ironically no little bit of "mysticism" in Passmore's call to man to take a via media between a return to nature on the one hand and a proud domination of her on the other. "If we ask, indeed, what human beings add to the world by their presence in it, there is, I should say, only one possible reply: civilisation" (p. 170). Man, uniquely, transforms the world into a civilized state (p. 178). Man alone can create (p. 180). One begins to ask just how it is that old, plebian evolution has alchemically produced in man an apprentice who can turn the dross of reproduction into--creativity. But no matter. It seems that the good news Passmore brings sounds quite traditional: greed [avarice] is the root of all [ecological] evil (p. 187). Yet what emerges is a sort of higher utilitarianism, a utilitar- ianism which strives to bring about "the greatest good for the greatest number"-not just of the human species, but of all sentient beings, at least (cf. the citation from Bentham, p. 114). Passmore argues (p. 123) that we are called to a higher reverence for life, yet not such an exaggerated one as that practiced by the Jains of India. Here, somewhat uncharacteristically, Passmore comes out on the Stoic side: to treat animals and plants as if they were persons would make civi- lization impossible. And here comes the rub. "Theologians are now busily attempting to work out new attitudes to nature, still consonant in a general way with traditional Christianity but reverting in important respects to a prelapsarian conception of man and man's role and denying that men have a sacredness which animals do not possess" (p. 184). And Pass- more's own conclusion is that he "more than doubt[s] whether Chris- tian theology can thus reshape itself without ceasing to be distinctively Christian" (p. 184). Even Charles Darwin had his mystical moments, and in one of the better known of them mused that animals and men "might all be</page><page sequence="3">566 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS netted together," that they who share our toil and pain and go about with us on this journey might have some special relationship to us that we have refused to examine. It is most sobering to see Christianity wrestling with that suggestion. Like all Passmore's works, this one is worth reading. It is pro- vocative, erudite, and good reading. But it is puzzling. And a reviewer can do little better than the author who, in summing up, finds it im- possible to sum up (p. 194). We are left with enigmas, paradoxes, dilemmas: civilization is impossible unless we treat sentient creatures as means, not ends; yet such treatment leads to callousness which feeds the fires of greed and avarice, which in turn make civilization unbear- able. Man must give up the metaphysical conceit of his uniqueness, and yet not submit to nature and thus lose his unique power of trans- forming nature. And man must develop an ecological ethic (and metaphysic?) without the freaked-out excesses of the [oc] cultish young, yet one emphasizing the somewhat romantic concept of respon- sibility toward nature. -JOHN LYON</page></plain_text>
