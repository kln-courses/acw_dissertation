The classicist Jasper Griffin has argued that the heroic, pioneering age of textual criticism is over and that we are now living in a quieter age of commentaries, the 'instruments of settled education, enjoyment and profit', as he metaphorically describes them.1 In classics the returns from textual criticism diminished to an exiguous level some time ago. In modern German literature, however, there are still opportunities for textual critics, chief among which, to the shame of Ger- manists, is Goethe's Faust. The most celebrated work in the history of German literature has not had a complete critical edition since volumes xiv and xv of Erich Schmidt's Weimarer Ausgabe appeared in 1887 and 1888, and these have long been regarded as seriously deficient.

The only attempt at a critical edition, Ernst Grumach's Akademie-Ausgabe, was wound up with only Faust I completed. Together the three new editions under review here represent the most in- tensive period of editorial activity on Faust since the 1950s. Albrecht Schone's two-volume edition for the Deutscher Klassiker Verlag, the result of a dozen years' work by Schone and his team of assistants, appeared in 1994 (henceforth cited as FA, 1, vn/i and vn/2). According to its dust jacket, volume 1 offers Faust 'in einer von Entstellungen befreiten authentischen Textgestalt, dazu hand- schriftengetreu die Fruhe Fassung und alle Entwlirfe und unterdriickten Pas- sagen in vervollstandigter und zuverlassiger Fassung'. It also contains Schone's own performing text (Buhnenfassung) ofthe 'Walpurgisnacht' from Faust I. Vol? ume 11 provides over 1,100 pages of commentary. At the same time, Dorothea Holscher-Lohmeyer was working on a new edition of Faust II for the Hanser Verlag's Miinchner Ausgabe of Goethe's Sdmtliche Werke nach Epochen seines Schajfens, under the general editorship of Karl Richter (henceforth cited as MA, xviii/i). (The Urfaust had appeared in 1987 edited by Gerhard Sauder, Faust; Ein Fragment in 1990 edited by Edith Zehm, and the 1808 Faust I in volume vi/i edited by Victor Lange.) Holscher-Lohmeyer enjoyed the assis- tance of her husband, the classicist Uvo Holscher, who had responsibility for editing Goethe's text. It was published in 1997, late enough to take notice of Schone's new text of Faust II, but too soon to respond in detail to his commen? tary. At nearly 700 pages, Holscher-Lohmeyer's commentary is even longer proportionately than Schone's. In 1999 Reclam published another new edition of Faust with a two-volume commentary of over 2,100 pages by Ulrich Gaier. The first volume is a line-by-line commentary, the second a series of interpre? tative essays, each reading Faust from a different thematic perspective. This follows on from Gaier's 1989 Reclam edition ofthe Urfaust and represents the result of nearly thirty years of work. Also in 1999 a fourth, revised edition of Schone's Faust appeared, including an index to the commentary volume, a new text of Faust I edited from a different base text, and responses to critics and reviewers of the first edition. Griffm's view that textual criticism has given way to commentary applies to these editions too. They contain commentary in abundance. Yet although the texts represent considerable improvements on the Weimarer Ausgabe and its descendants, and although the editors give detailed accounts of the text's history and discuss many of the textual problems, none of the editions dares to call itself a critical edition. The editions have already been reviewed individu- ally, and Schone's has been the subject of a short, penetrating article by Peter Michelsen, as well as some excitable press coverage.2 One justification for sub- 2 See the reviews of Schone by Gerwin Marahrens in Goethe-Jahrbuch, 114 (1997), 285-301, and Theodore Ziolkowski in Arbitrium, 14 (1996), 86-91.

The textual history of Faust is particularly intractable, and the issues surrounding the editors' treatment of the text require more explanation than a reviewer can normally give. But it is the fact that there is no modern critical edition of Faust that makes a detailed assessment of the new editions necessary. The commentaries also deserve extended scrutiny. Each is a monu- mental achievement and a major event in the study of Faust. It must be said, however, that their design is quite different from the traditional line-by-line commentary, which was supposed to 'elucidate and make sense of the text' for the benefit of the studious reader.3 In the second half of this article I shall try to give a sense of how effective the commentaries are and what are the main strengths and weaknesses of each. After the posthumous publication of Faust II in 1832 the next important advance in the editing of Faust was Erich Schmidt's discovery of a transcript of an early form of Faust (henceforth referred to as U), which he published in vol? ume 1, xlix ofthe Weimarer Ausgabe under the title 'Faust. In urspriinglicher Gestalt'. Copied down by the Weimar courtier Luise von Gochhausen at some time between 1776 and 1780, the so-called Urfaust is probably a copy of Goethe's original manuscript, which he had brought with him to Weimar from Frankfurt in 1775 and from which he gave several readings to Weimar friends and notables. U appears to be a fairly accurate copy, as its punctuation and orthography correspond quite closely to Goethe's highly idiosyncratic and affected habits in the 1770s. Where it contains un-Goethean spellings, these are generally either harmless normalizations (fi for ss, k for ck after consonants in words such as dencken) or the result of Gochhausen's spelling according to her own spoken Thuringian dialect (confusion of h with/) and d with ?).4 The colla- tion of the manuscript presents some minor problems. Upper- and lower-case d are often indistinguishable, and the joining of words is virtually undecidable in some cases. These problems can be inspected in the (slightly fuzzy) facsimile of U printed in volume 1 of Ernst Grumach's Akademie-Ausgabe of 1954. The first edition of Faust published in Goethe's lifetime was Faust: Ein Fragment (henceforth referred to as S) in volume vii of Goschen's Goethe's Schriften (1790). The manuscript fair copy made for the printers, which would have provided an interesting comparison with the Gochhausen transcript, has not survived. However, it appears still to have been in circulation as late as 1816, when a new separate edition of Faust I by Cotta was published (E2) that at four points diverges from the 1808 separate edition (Ei) and gives readings that correspond to U. The Fragment version, as well as shedding light on Goethe's attitude to the Faust material in the 1780s, has some authority in the textual history of Faust. For instance, in the scene 'Hexenkuche' at lines 2348-50 all other editions published in Goethe's lifetime have Mephistopheles saying to Faust: nung', Goethe-Jahrbuch, 114 (1997), 313.

Only S has what must be the correct reading, 'dich zu verjiingen'. Aside from U and S, the only other surviving materials from the genesis of Faust I are a handful of manuscript fragments from the period 1797-1801. These include the notorious Blocksberg scenes on which Schone has based his heavily edited performing text ofthe 'Walpurgisnacht'. Finally there is a manuscript of eight lines of material from the 'Walpurgisnachtstraum' (11. 4335-42) that first ap? peared in the Ausgabe letzter Hand' (1828/9). Faust I was first published in 1808 in volume viii of Goethe's Werke by Cotta in Stuttgart (A). A virtually identical separate edition of Faust (Ei) appeared in the same year. This was followed by the separate edition referred to above, E2, in 1816. A text virtually identical to E2 appeared as volume ix of a second Cotta edition of Goethe's Werke in 1817 (B). Mean while the fair copy on which E2 was based was sent by Cotta to Vienna for a licensed edition of 1817, Goethe's Werke: Originalausgabe, by Kaulfuss und Armbruster (Bi). As a resetting from the manuscript, Bi has some value as a potential corrective to E2 and B. The last complete edition to appear in Goethe's lifetime, the 'Vollstandige Ausgabe letzter Hand' (C), was published by Cotta in two formats in 1828 and 1829, the earlier 'Taschenbuch' (Ci) and later 'GroB-Oktav' editions (C3). Goethe began with the intention of himself revising the text for Ci. In ad- dition he arranged for the Jena classics professor Karl Wilhelm Gottling to go through the text of B correcting obvious errors and normalizing spelling and punctuation.5 It was not Gottling's brief to carry out a full-scale recen- sion of the printed and manuscript source material and compare it with B. Nor was Gottling a full-time editor; newly appointed to his chair, he had other more pressing and interesting business than correcting Goethe's spelling. Still, Goethe was extremely happy with the early samples of Gottling's work and therefore reviewed only some of it. The resulting edition, Ci, was then reset for the larger-format C3. In neither case, Ci or C3, were the proofs corrected in Weimar by Goethe or Gottling or others. As C3 was a resetting of Ci and is therefore likely to have introduced new errors, while not comparing its source Ci against Gottling's original corrected version of B, it is to be assumed that C3 is less reliable than Ci. The editors ofthe Weimarer Ausgabe seem to have been unaware of this when they decided to use C3 as their base text. It is also worth noting that in the Hamburger Ausgabe Erich Trunz is under the misappre- hension that the reason why Ci appears more reliable than C3 is that it is later than C3 and corrects C3's errors.6 However, in some cases C3 corrects errors in Ci and in particular tends to omit some of its punctuation. (For instance, Ci has commas at line 51 'Wehen,' and line 343 'muB, als Teufel, schaffen', which C3 omits, arguably to better effect.) The latter tendency may have been in response to a general directive by Goethe, who, when editing, tended to delete rather than add punctuation. In summary, then, Ci has better authority, 5 Ernst Grumach, 'Prolegomena zu einer Goethe-Ausgabe', Goethe, 12 (1950), 60-88 (pp. 66- 8s). 6 See e.g. HA, in, 662.</page><page sequence="5">638 Three Recent Editions of Goethe's (Faust' but C3 cannot be discounted. In addition, the fair copy ('Druckvorlage') from which C1 was set survives in the Cotta archive at the Deutsches Literaturarchiv in Marbach (CiCoDv). This differs from Ci itself in over seventy places, for the most part minor changes introduced into the text by Cotta's editors and setters. As well as Faust I, volume xn of C contains Act I of Faust II (up to line 6036) and volume iv of C contains Act III of Faust II. What should an editor make of this? The texts of Faust I belong to one of three families: the 'Vorstufen' of Faust I, including the Urfaust, the Fragment, the manuscript fragments and paralipomena; the first Cotta edition (A) and its successors (B, E); and the 'Ausgabe letzter Hand' (C). The last of these is technically speaking the first complete edition of Faust I, as A, B, and E do not contain lines 4335-42. Normal editing practice would be to choose one of these texts as a base text and adduce variants from the others as and when they appear preferable. However, there is a significant problem. Punctuation and orthography vary widely between the A family (A . ..) and the C family (C . ..). A . . . and C . . . are, for those who take orthography and punctuation seriously, very different. One answer might be to conclude that A . . . and C . . . are irreconcilable and therefore to print both. However, for reasons of economics and practicality?it would help to have a single text of Faust I that we could all recognize as authoritative?an editor of Faust has to make a choice. It could be argued that there are reasons for preferring A . . . The orthography of A . . . is broadly based on Adelung's, which comes as close as any does to constituting a late-eighteenth-century standard. The orthography of C . . ., by contrast, was devised by Gottling specifically for this edition, on the arguably spurious and certainly pedantic basis of etymology.7 In addition the punctuation of A . . . is generally sparser and thus closer to Goethe's own lifelong (though inconsistent) practice of punctuating rhetorically rather than syntactically. Admittedly none of these considerations gives a conclusive answer to the problem, but it is a problem to which any solution is going to be imperfect. For the Akademie- Ausgabe Grumach used A . . . for the above reasons. Lange's volume vi/i of the new Munchner Ausgabe ('Weimarer Klassik 1798-1806') gives A . . ., as the rationale of the edition dictates. All other major editions have used C . . . Schone's first edition works from Ci, his fourth edition from CiCoDv. Gaier uses Ci. Both justify this by citing Schmidt's (questionable) conclusion that C is the edition over which Goethe took the most care.8 What then of the other members of the families? Having chosen a base text, what does an editor do with the variants from the 'Vorstufen' or junior members of A . . . and C . . .? The same argument that was used against mixing evidence from the different families?that they represent, historically and aesthetically, quite different texts?is used by Schone for not consulting other members of C . . . To do so would produce a 'Mischtext' that is merely an artefact of the editing process and corresponds to no single text that Goethe 7 Grumach, Trolegomenazu einer Goethe-Ausgabe', p. 82. 8 'Fiir den Druck der Werke hat [Goethe] selbst die Norm gegeben in der Ausgabe letzter Hand.

Er hat mit groBter Umsicht, mit einer Sorgfalt wie bei keiner friiheren, sich um die Reinheit und Voilkommenheit dieser Ausgabe selbst bemuht' (WA, 1, 1, xix; quoted by Schone in FA, 1, vn/2, 69).</page><page sequence="6">MATTHEW BELL 639 himself ever envisaged. We shall return to this argument in due course, but a few words relating specifically to Faust I need to be said here. Editors have traditionally believed that in restoring a 'better' text they were executing the author's will, which was always to produce a text entirely free from the errors introduced in the publishing process. Schone's argument is that Goethe's will is best represented by publishing CiCoDv, the text authorized by Goethe for publication prior to its corruption by Cotta's typesetters. However, Goethe was lax, and it is clear that CiCoDv represents his authorial will only partially. One might even say that the only proper sense in which CiCoDv reflects Goethe's will is that it has his imprimatur: what Goethe authorized in 1828 was the printing of the text, not the text itself, which he had not read in full. Moreover, despite the work of Gottling CiCoDv represents a sedimentary accretion of layers of authorial and editorial activity by Goethe and others reaching back from 1828 to the early 1770s. It is, by virtue of its extended genesis and complex publishing history, already a 'Mischtext'. The only way to achieve what Schone appears to want?a text that fully expresses Goethe's will?would be a 'historisch-kritisch' edition that fully documented the genesis and textual history of Faust I. For reasons to be discussed below, this would be a questionable undertaking in any case. The circumstances surrounding the text of Faust II are even more complex, but despite this the issues facing an editor are perhaps clearer. A manuscript fair copy ofthe whole of Faust II survives, the so-called 'Mundum' (H), which was dictated to or copied by Goethe's secretaries John and Schuchardt, with Acts I, II, IV, and V in John's hand and Act III in Schuchardt's. It is not a particularly fair copy, however, as it is covered in corrections by Riemer, Eckermann, Gottling, and Goethe himself. Goethe sealed the manuscript in July 1831, intending it for posthumous publication by Riemer and Eckermann. In January 1832 he reopened it to make further corrections. There is extensive evidence of the correcting of spelling and punctuation, but this is by no means systematic (e.g. in the use of k and ck, and s and J3). There are also arguably signs of incompleteness, notably the queries in Riemer's hand at lines 6847 and 8386.9 Moreover, Act III was extracted from the bound manuscript in 1828 for use as the proof for C volume iv, and then rebound into the manuscript. In addition there is a manuscript copy of the part of Act I that was published in volume xn of C. This is a copy made by John in January to February 1828. It contains over 300 corrections by Goethe. Finally there are around 300 manuscript fragments of Faust II, some autographs, others in scribes' hands, the latter containing in places what appear to be corrections ordered by Goethe. These are of obvious potential value, inasmuch as they give earlier and therefore possibly less corrupted readings than H. As we have noted, part of Act I appeared in volume xn of C and Act III in volume ix. After Goethe's death the whole of Faust II appeared in volume xli of C, edited by Riemer and Eckermann. This edition is full of errors and poorly justified editorial interventions. The Weimarer Ausgabe used the C editions of the parts of the text published in Goethe's lifetime and H for the 9 MA, xviii/i ,632; the significance of these notes is contested by Schone in FA, 1, vii/2, 75.</page><page sequence="7">640 Three Recent Editions of Goethe's 'Faust' rest. Subsequent editions have followed this practice, including Gaier's and the Munchner Ausgabe. Schone, however, reproduces H throughout, with only minimal intervention such as modernizing orthography (/ for y, t for th) and altering some punctuation. He thus ignores evidence from the parts published during Goethe's lifetime, justifying this with the argument that we have already mentioned in the context of Faust I?that it would result in a 'Mischtext'. This policy has been severely criticized by Peter Michelsen and Rudolf Kassel.10 Before considering how the new editions deal with these problems, it is only fair to note that their editors all state that they are not to be regarded as critical editions. In saying this, what they appear to have in mind is not a critical edition, but a 'historiseh-kritisch' edition, which, as Schone puts it, 'auf dem inzwischen erreichten Kenntnisstand und nach neueren Editions- grundsatzen neben einem zuverlassigen Text beider Teile alle Lesarten ein- schlieBlich der sogenannten Paralipomena und moglichst auch die wichtigsten Uberlieferungsvarianten verfiigbar [machen wurde]' (FA, 1, vii/2, 80).ll This only muddies the waters, though, for a 'historiseh-kritisch' edition of Faust does not exist, nor is one likely to in the foreseeable future. Indeed, by the lights of recent editorial theory, the very idea of a 'historiseh-kritisch' edition must be viewed as a chimera. It presumes that we can represent the genesis of a text in the format of an edition, whereas this can by definition only be done by means of a narrative of the text's composition. Editing causes a text to become fixed; genesis is dynamic. The question, then, is not whether the new editions by Schone, Holscher-Lohmeyer, and Gaier should be judged as 'historiseh- kritisch' editions, but whether they should be judged as critical editions. Since they return adfontes, evaluate the textual evidence critically, and list relevant textual variants, the answer to this must be 'yes'. In Schone's commentary sixty-six pages are given over to the discussion of Fausfs textual history. What principles do the editors apply to editing the text? Holscher uses the traditional methods of textual criticism, as one would expect from a classicist. His aim is to reconstruct a text of Faust II that best expresses Goethe's will, giving due attention to variants in the manuscript fragments. He also corrects grammatical and other obvious errors for which no variants exist (MA, xvin/i, 633-4). Gaier follows a similar line, though making less of textual issues. This brings us to Schone's edition. Schone's guiding principle is the 'diplomatic' re- production of the base texts, U for the Urfaust, CiCoDv for Faust I, and H for Faust II. That is to say, Schone abjures editorial intervention in the text (except in the case of a few flagrant errors). His justification for this is threefold. First, and least controversially, he aims to preserve the 'alien' appearance of this 'old' text by following Goethe's page format and habits of punctuation, although as we have noted this does not extend to retaining all of the original orthography and punctuation.12 Aside from these exceptions, he aims at a faithful repro- duction of the base texts. This means that potentially better variants in other 10 Michelsen, 'Diplomatik als Editionsprinzip', pp. 699-706, and Kassel, 'Entgegnung auf eine Entgegnung',p. 313. 11 See also MA, xviii/i, 632-33, and Gaier, Texte, p. 682. 12 Peculiaritiesand inconsistenciesin Schone's modernizing orthography have been pointed out by Kassel, Thilologische Bemerkungen zu einer neuen Faust-Ausgabe', p. 378.</page><page sequence="8">MATTHEW BELL 641 manuscripts and published texts are not used, as these would 'contaminate' the base text.13 In the same spirit he talks of Grumach's Akademie-Ausgabe of Faust I as 'contaminating', inasmuch as it uses Ei as its base text but looks at all available textual evidence (FA, I, vii/2, 80). In the fourth edition he uses this term again to describe Holscher's 'contaminating' text of Faust II (FA, 1, vii/2, 90). Schone's target is the traditional method of textual criticism, which he labels 'Rekonstruktionsphilologie' (FA, 1, vn/2, 91). This leads us to Schone's second justification for his editorial practice. Whereas the evidence of the base text is objective, assuming of course that it has been collated correctly, an edi- tor's interventions in the text, by contrast, are subjective. It is hard to see the force of this argument, however, for a properly framed critical edition will make its workings transparent. If it is subjective?that is, if the judgements made by the editor are based on personal preferences and not on the weighing up of evidence?then that subjectivity will be apparent and the reader will be in a position to weigh up the arguments critically. Schone's third argument is that traditional 'Rekonstruktionsphilologie' is not appropriate to modern literature, in particular when editors have access to autograph manuscripts. This argument was first made by Friedrich Beiss- ner, defending his new Holderlin edition and, incidentally, criticizing Gru? mach's Akademie-Ausgabe.14 Beissner argued that editing modern texts is dif? ferent from editing classical ones because of the fundamental difference be? tween 'genetic variants' (Entstehungsvarianten) and 'variants of transmission' (Uberlieferungsvarianten), that is to say between variants that arise from the process of composition and variants that are merely products of the publishing process. While classical textual criticism has ways of distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant examples of the latter, it has nothing to say about the former. As Beissner rightly points out, the practice of presenting variants in a critical apparatus will often not work for genetic variants, because what appears in an apparatus as an individual variant word may well be part of a greater string of sense that has changed in the course of composition. Presenting single-word variants in an apparatus can therefore be misleading, for it is often the blocks of sense that are the variants, not the individual words. (It should be noted, however, that the same applies to the transmission of classical texts, when, for instance, a scribe, mistaking the sense of a sentence, replaces the correct reading of a word with an erroneous reading that conforms to his misunderstanding of the text.) Beissner's argument overlooks the fact that there can be a grey area between genetic variants and variants of transmission. Indeed, this is precisely the char- acteristic of modern texts that makes them different from classical texts. As A. E. Housman showed in the preface to his edition of Manilius, there are two quite different types of consideration that an editor of a classical text has to weigh up: 'internal' considerations of poetic appropriateness and 'external' 13 Holscher has pointed out that this is not what contamination means (MA, xviii/i, 634). It is also telling that Schone talks of the base texts diverging ('abweichen', FA, 1, vn/2, 96) from the text of his edition, when properly it is the other way round. See also Michelsen, 'Diplomatik als Editionsprinzip', p. 703. 14 Friedrich Beissner, 'Editionsmethoden der neueren deutschen Philologie', Zeitschrift fiir deutsche Philologie, 83 Sonderheft (1964), 72-95 (pp. 73-77).</page><page sequence="9">642 Three Recent Editions of Goethe's 'Faust' considerations of textual transmission.15 The former are poetic: what makes the best sense and what is the poet most likely to have written? The latter have to do with the nature of manuscript transmission and will involve an editor asking where the manuscripts come from, how they relate to one another, what sorts of error are likely to have occurred in scribal copying, and so on. These two types of consideration have virtually nothing to do with each other. For modern texts, on the other hand, they can meet in the middle, because the pro? cesses of writing, editing, and publishing are not necessarily divorced. Writers often continue to work at texts that are in the process of being edited or even published. Seen in this way, the argument leads to a very different conclusion, namely that H is unlikely to be an unimpeachable witness. One thing we know for certain about H is that it was not written by Goethe alone. It was written by John and Schuchardt, with corrections by John, Schuchardt, Gottling, Riemer, Eckermann, and Goethe himself. Some ofthe textual variants in H are probably genetic variants, some are certainly errors introduced by Goethe's helpers. In some cases it is unclear which is which. Faust II is thus a classic case of the grey area between genetic variants and variants of transmission. Schone's argument that the method of classical philology is inappropriate is therefore clearly inapplicable. It is hard to see why simply accepting the evidence of H, as Schone recommends, despite the fact (acknowledged by Schone) that some of its readings are artefacts of transcription or unauthorized editorial interventions by Goethe's helpers, is any less subjective than critically analysing it. Indeed, by setting up H as his sole textual authority, Schone is guilty of what Grumach criticized the Weimarer Ausgabe for, namely: die Kanonisierung eines bestimmten Druckes als Textgrundlage, von dem nur bei offenkundigen Korruptelen und nur mit Zustimmung der Mehrzahl der Redaktoren abgewichen werden darf, ein Verfahren, das ohnehin den Erfordernissen und den Grundsatzen einer kritischen Edition zuwiderlauft. Denn die Aufgabe eines kritischen Editors kann es nur sein, den besten Text herzustellen. Das klingt tautologisch und ist es vielleicht auch, bleibt aber die einzig mogliche Umschreibung der verwickelten und verantwortungsreichen Aufgabe des Editors, unter Berucksichtigung aller vorhan- denen Zeugen eines Textes und aller seine Geschichte bestimmenden Faktoren die Textfassung herzustellen, die der Intention des Autors den adaquatesten Ausdruck verleiht. Wird diese Arbeit von vornherein dadurch unterbunden, daB ein einziger handschriftlicher Zeuge oder ein Druck fur sakrosankt erklart wird und alle anderen Zeugen nur historisch oder akzessorisch berucksichtigt werden, so kann von Textkritik und damit auch von einer kritischen Edition nicht mehr die Rede sein. (Prolegomena, p. 64) Or, as Housman put it, 'Tell the average man that inert adhesion to one author? ity is methodical criticism, and you tell him good news.'16 Michelsen and Kassel have criticized Schone for appearing to suppress his own critical judgement. If the arguments set out here are correct, then the criticism seems justified. In 15 See Manilius, Astronomicon libri quinque, ed. by A. E. Housman, 5 vols (London: Richards, I9?3~3?)&gt; !&gt; xxx-lxix. Housman's 'scurrilous preface' (v, v) was mainly concerned to defend the practice of conjectural emendation and to ridicule what he saw as the German tendency to rely on the stemmatic method of evaluating and weighting manuscripts. 16 Manilius, Astronomicon libri quinque, 1, xxxiii.</page><page sequence="10">MATTHEW BELL 643 fact, as we shall see, Schone repeatedly compromises his 'diplomatic' principle and, trusting in his own judgement, intervenes in the text. From the point of view of his critics, this is a good thing. Indeed, the problem is that he does not trust his judgement more often.17 In his text of the Urfaust, or 'Fruhe Fassung', as he more properly calls it, Schone takes the diplomatic policy to its extreme, opting for an exact repro- duction of U, in so far as printing technology allows. This means that in places Schone's text contains clear errors. For instance, he prints U's wonderfully anthropomorphic reading in line 88, where Faust contemplates the sign of the macrocosm and sees 'die winkende Natur'. Schone sees that errors of this sort cannot be left unremarked and so gives the corresponding Faust I text at the foot of the page in a pseudo-apparatus. He justifies his approach as follows: Wo der Leser solche Fehler nicht muhelos erkennen und berichtigen kann, gibt eine FuBnote gleich unter der betreffenden Textseite den entsprechenden Wortlaut des Faust I, mit dessen Hilfe man durchkommt. (FA, 1, vii/2, 100) The apparatus exists to stop readers having to struggle to recognize errors in the text that they cannot easily correct themselves. One wonders whether many readers will in fact struggle to recognize errors; one imagines they would either recognize them or not. Indeed Schone's phrasing suggests he might have conflated two problems: the reader failing to notice an erroneous reading and consequently misunderstanding the text, and the reader recognizing the error but 'struggling' to correct it. It is clear that in both cases editorial intervention of some sort is desirable. Examples of the former include line 1172, where Schone reproduces U's reading 'Habe vor den Menschen ein heimlich Grauen', whereas S and all subsequent texts have 'vor dem Menschen'. U thus has Gretchen fearing people in general instead of 'that person', Mephistopheles. An example of the latter occurs when Faust looks up at the light in the sacristy and compares it to his feelings. U reads 'So siehts in diesen Busen machtig' (1. 1402), which is clearly nonsense. A reader might need help discovering what is in fact meant: 'So siehts in diesem Busen nachtig'. The other peculiar aspect of Schone's apparatus is that it gives not a corrected reading of U, but the corresponding text in Faust I. So at line 504, where U gives the nonsensical 'Wies lehret manche Welch Geschicht', Schone supplies the Faust I text 'welsche'. Editors of the Urfaust have traditionally corrected 'Welch' to 'Welsch' in the text proper?the sort of intervention Schone dislikes. This is the couplet as it appears in WA 1, xlix and most other editions of the Urfaust: 'Das Piippgen geknat und zugericht, | Wie's lehret manche Welsch Geschicht'. This is how the lines appear in Faust I: 'Das Piippchen geknetet und zugericht't, | Wie's lehret manche welsche Geschicht'. In Faust I an extra syllable has been added in 'geknetet' that makes rhythmical sense of the extra syllable in 'welsche'. By the same token 'welsche' would be rhythmically wrong in the Urfaust. It is clear why Schone supplies 'welsche': his policy is to avoid anything that smacks of editorial subjectivity. But it is hard to see how in this case the policy helps the reader. Another relatively trivial example occurs at line 441, where U has Mephistopheles saying to the Student: 'Eritis sicut Deus 17 Michelsen, 'Diplomatik als Editionsprinzip', p. 705.</page><page sequence="11">644 Three Recent Editions of Goethe's 'Faust' scientis bonum et malum'. Schone's apparatus reads: 'Faust I, v. 2048 richtig: SCIENTES'. This is problematic, because Schone's 'richtig' is against his own principle of non-intervention. The point of citing Faust I readings was to avoid the intrusion of an editorial voice. It seems that here Schone is eager to correct what is a relatively inconsequential error (most editors retain it) because he believes (rather oddly) that Goethe's quotations from the Bible are accurate, a belief that does more serious damage in one case in Faust II, as we shall see in due course. Gaier also adopts a diplomatic policy towards U, but is not as consistent as Schone. He makes three emendations (1. 203 'unerquicklich' for U 'neu erquick- lich'; 1. 1122 'Uber' for U 'Uber', which Schone keeps; 1. 1402 'nachtig' for U 'machtig'), makes insertions for misspellings ('Wel[s]ch Geschicht') and An- standsstriche ('[Scheis] Haus', 1. 302), and silently corrects some errors (Auer- bachs Keller: 'Es war einmal ein Konig' for U 'Er war . . .'). However, he retains 'die winkende Natur' (1. 88), on the grounds that it is 'sinnvoll'?a weak argument, given that 'neu erquicklich' and 'Er war einmal ein Konig' also make sense after a fashion and are obviously wrong. More damagingly, at line 1172 Gaier retains U's 'den Menschen' and so has Gretchen fearful of going out into the street, and at line 1402 keeps U's 'in diesen Busen', even though he corrects 'machtig' to 'nachtig'. 'Diesem' is clearly required. Presumably Gaier means us to read 'diese Busen' as referring to Faust's and Gretchen's breasts. But that ignores the deictic force of 'diese', and in any case the plural usually denotes the female breasts?see e.g. WA, 1, vm, 53?which would be unfortunate in this context.18 In conclusion, while a diplomatic reproduction of U is undoubtedly desirable, part of the text's attraction being its unpolished immediacy, an editor must surely either correct nonsense or at least indicate in a note where a reading is nonsense and how it is to be corrected. In a handful of admittedly minor cases Schone and Gaier fail to do the editor's job of helping the reader. The main issue in editing Faust I is which family an editor takes the base text from, A . . . or C . . ., and what value is assigned to variants from the other family. Schone and Gaier both use C . . ., whereas in MA, vi/2 Lange gives Grumach's version of A . . . The differences between these are numerous, but mainly confined to orthography and punctuation. There is one striking difference between Schone's and Gaier's editions, in the Erdgeist's words at lines 501-03, where Schone reads: In Lebensfluten, im Tatensturm Wall' ich auf und ab, Wehe hin und her! U, S, A, and Bi read 'Webe' at line 503, all other editions 'Wehe'. The Weimarer Ausgabe printed 'Wehe', because it tended to see editions after A as improve- ments on A. That was until Schmidt found 'Webe' in Bi. This reading cannot just be a hangover from the earlier reading, as Bi's text is based on the same fair copy as B, which reads 'Wehe'. Thus either Bi's 'Webe' or B's 'Wehe' must be 18 I can find no example of Goethe having used the plural 'die Busen' in the sense needed here (breast, seat of the emotions).</page><page sequence="12">MATTHEW BELL 645 a printing error. The textual history allows two possibilities. It is possible that Goethe wrote 'Webe' (A) but subsequently changed it to 'Wehe'. Bi's 'Webe' will then be a printer's error. An editor using Ci as the base text will read 'Wehe', and an editor using A will read 'Webe'. Alternatively Goethe wrote 'Webe', and 'Wehe' is a printer's error in B that went unnoticed and thus ap? peared in all subsequent editions stemming from B. (Bi does not.) The latter seems more likely, but the textual evidence is not compelling, and in this case internal arguments will surely carry more weight. Schmidt preferred 'Webe' on internal grounds, and so read 'Webe' in the Jubilaumsausgabe, in which he has been followed by all subsequent editors, including Gaier.19 There are numerous differences in punctuation between C . . . and A . . ., which do of course affect one's breathing while reading the text and, in a few cases, can be argued to have an effect on sense. For instance, Goethe liked to insert commas to indicate pauses before or after adverbial phrases and so to convey a sense ofthe speaker's attitude. Adverbial phrases with commas round them can express a heavier emphasis on the adverbial items. It can, for instance, make sequences of adverbial phrases sound like lists and so convey an attitude of weariness: Wie traurig steigt die unvollkommne Scheibe Des rothen Monds mit spater Gluth heran, Und leuchtet schlecht, daB man bei jedem Schritte, Vor einen Baum, vor einen Felsen rennt! (3851-54: CiCoDv, Ci, WA) Schone removes the comma after 'Schritte', which is grammatically correct. This removes what is arguably a direction to the actor or reader to linger over 'bei jedem Schritte' and thus express Mephistopheles' affected world- weariness. The normalizing of punctuation to modern rules is characteristic of Schone's text. So at line 620 Schone reads 'Und, schaffend, Gotterleben zu genieBen', where his base text CiCoDv has 'Und schaffend,'. The former is more correct, but the latter arguably corresponds better to natural breathing of the line. Schone also 'corrects' Goethe's highly idiosyncratic use of exclamation and question marks. Hence Schone sometimes has question marks at the end of rhetorical questions where Goethe has none. Similarly Schone removes the question mark from CiCoDv's 'Das sieht schon besser aus! Man sieht doch wo und wie?' (1. 2037). Schone's reading is more correct, but again it is debatable whether it is truer to the feel of Goethe's text. Similarly the comma after 'Glase' at line 2174 in C, which Schone removes, indicates a pause that can be used to comic effect to emphasize Brand's drunkenness or pomposity. Finally Schone has a policy of replacing the semicolon between the protasis and apodosis of a conditional sentence (a not uncommon eighteenth-century habit) with a 'correct' comma.20 These issues are discussed at length in the introduction to Schone's commentary (FA, 1, vii/2, 108-15). Otherwise Schone is broadly true to his diplomatic principle. He breaks it at line 2348 (discussed above), where only S and a list of errata in Riemer's hand 19 See Michelsen, 'Diplomatikals Editionsprinzip', p. 701. 20 FA, 1, vn/2, 112-13; see e.g. 1. 2989, where Schone emends Tlatze;' to 'Platze,'.</page><page sequence="13">646 Three Recent Editions of Goethe's 'Faust' from 1809 have the correct reading. In some cases the diplomatic principle leads him to retain readings which he should have emended. At line 2080 he follows Ci's 'Ihr wollt", which is ungrammatical. Gaier follows the Weimarer Ausgabe's conjecture 'Ihr wollt', on the assumption that Ci 'wollt" is a tran? scription error from the manuscript's 'woll't'. At line 3419 Schone gives Ci's 'lieB', where a subjunctive 'lieB" is required and is thus emended by Gaier. Most damagingly, in the scene 'Triiber Tag. Feld' Schone prints the obviously erroneous 'wandle den Wurm wieder in seine Hundsgestalt, wie er sich oft nachtlicher Weise gefiel vor mir herzutrotten' (A-C). Diintzer had conjectured 'Weile', which was then found in U and so given textual support. Unlike Schone, Gaier accepts most of the traditional emendations, although in places his commentary suggests he would rather sit on the fence. Perhaps the most notorious error in Faust I is A's reading 'Leid' at line 21 of 'Zueignung': 'Mein Leid ertont der unbekannten Menge'. Riemer's 1809 list of errata notes that this should read 'Lied' (WA 111/4, 374). Yet all subsequent editions in Goethe's lifetime have 'Leid', except E2 and a few copies of a separate edition of 1825 (E4). Cotta's 1836-37 edition of Goethe's Werke (Q) also reads 'Lied'. Did Goethe decide to let 'Leid' stay or simply forget to make the correction? Schone emends to 'Lied' on grounds of poetic sense, ignoring his own criticism of editors' subjectivity. In the Hamburger Ausgabe Trunz had suggested that Goethe might have decided to keep 'Leid', as it expressed the idea of poetry giving voice to suffering, as in Torquato Tasso ('Gab mir ein Gott zu sagen wie ich leide', 1. 3432). Gaier also reads 'Lied' in preference to 'Leid' and like Trunz gives the cross-reference to Tasso. He does this for a different reason, though, arguing that the ambiguous reading expresses Goethe's view that the mean? ing of Faust is 'inkommensurabel'. It seems questionable, however, whether a disputed textual variant is the kind of incommensurability that Goethe meant. The idea of incommensurability also influences Gaier's policy on punctuation. In general he tends to follow A's relatively sparse use of commas compared to Ci. His justification for this is that the insertion of a comma sometimes removes a desirable ambiguity, and he cites the example of line 1086, 'Ich eile fort ihr ew'ges Licht zu trinken'. Trunz had inserted a comma after 'fort', thinking that what is meant is either 'I hurry away [sc. from here]' or 'I continue to hurry'. Gaier believes that the comma should be removed as it excludes a third reading: 'I hurry to drink its eternal light continuously'. This seems an unnat- ural way of reading the line. In any case, there is a stronger reason for omitting the comma, namely that Goethe often does not place commas round relative or subordinate clauses where he envisages the line being spoken without a pause. His punctuation is rhetorical, not grammatical. There is also a serious issue of interpretation connected to this seemingly minor textual problem. Both Gaier and Schone argue that the visual appearance of the text is an essential part of its meaning and that, in Schone's words, 'es in der Kunst, auch an den Dichtwerken, kaum etwas nur "AuBerliches" gebe' (FA, 1, vii/2, 98). He goes on to quote Goethe's plea to Cotta in 1805 to ensure that the proof-readers follow the manuscripts faithfully and without deviation. Viewed in this light, arguments about the punctuation of Faust will indeed come to seem important. However, it is by no means clear that in his own practice</page><page sequence="14">MATTHEW BELL 647 Goethe matched the standards of exactness he required of his publisher. He had his own idiosyncratic habits, such as mid-sentence question and exclamation marks, full stops instead of question marks, the use of commas, semicolons, and colons to indicate pauses of different lengths rather than logical relations, and he was not particularly consistent even in the use of these. Common sense therefore suggests that caution should be used in basing interpretations on Goethe's punctuation or the lack of it.21 In their approach to textual issues in Faust II the new editions diverge widely. Gaier and Holscher follow the traditional practice of combining H with the material published in C (Act I lines 1-6306, Act III), with reference also to the setter's fair copy of volume xn of Ci containing Act I lines 1-6306 (CiCoDv). Schone, by contrast, uses H as the base text throughout, arguing that use of the C material would result in 'contamination' and a 'Mischtext'. Holscher defends his text against this criticism as follows (MA, xviii/i, 634-6). The version of Act I lines 1-6306 in H represents the status quo in 1827. The new copy CiCoDv was made in January to February 1828. Mean while Goethe continued to work on the remainder of H up to 1831. Later he also returned to H Act I lines 1-6306, without, however, integrating all the corrections that had been made in CiCoDv. This means that there is a gap in the work on H Act I 1-6306 from 1827 to 1828, and this is filled by CiCoDv. In effect we have two manuscripts of Act I 1-6306 running in alternate shifts. But it does not mean that CiCoDv represents a different phase of work on Faust II, for the work on the two manuscripts is continuous. Therefore using evidence from CiCoDv would not create a 'Mischtext', as Schone alleges. Indeed, ignoring CiCoDv, as Schone recommends, would mean assuming that by not integrating all the corrections made in CiCoDv Goethe was silently revoking the changes he made to Act I 1-6306 in 1827-28. There is no evidence that Goethe meant to do this: it seems more likely that he simply forgot to integrate the CiCoDv changes. Holscher's reasoning seems sound. The first thing that must be said about all three editions is that, in returning to H and collating it afresh, they are able to make some significant improve- ments over other modern editions stemming from the Weimarer Ausgabe, as all reviewers have agreed. One especially striking example is Baucis' warning against accepting Faust's offer of relocation to a parcel of newly reclaimed land. C, Q, the Weimarer Ausgabe, and all subsequent editions read: 'Traue nicht dem Wasserboden, | Halt' auf deiner Hohe Stand!' (11. 11137-38). H reads 'den Wasserboten', which is supported by the manuscript fragment Hi, where Goethe has altered 'auf seine Boten' to 'den Wasserboten'. The Miinchner Aus? gabe helpfully notes that Baucis' dismissive neologism 'Wasserboten' neatly expresses her mistrust. Not all of the new readings are such obvious improvements. At line 10998, in the Archbishop's greedy and blackmailing attempt to win more land out of the Emperor, Schone, Holscher, and Gaier all have the Archbishop asking for: 21 See the sensible comments by Nicholas Boyle, An Idealist Faust? Goethe's Wager in the Context of Intellectual History', in History and Literature: Essays in Honor of Karl S. Guthke, ed. by William Collins Donahue and Scott Denham (Tubingen: Stauffenburg, 2000), pp. 29-46 (PP- 33-34)-</page><page sequence="15">648 Three Recent Editions of Goethe's 'Faust' Den breiten Hiigelraum, da wo dein Zelt gestanden, Mit Berg und dichtem Wald, so weit sie sich erstrecken, Mit Hohen die sich griin zu steter Weide decken, Fischreichen, klaren Seen, dann Bachlein ohne Zahl, Wie sie sich, eilig schlangelnd, sturzen ab zu Thal. (11. 10993-11000) This is H's and Ci's reading. A correction by Goethe in H changes 'steter' to 'fetter', and this latter reading was adopted by the Weimarer Ausgabe and sub? sequent editions. Although 'stet' is less obvious and therefore perhaps prefer- able, 'fett' does seem to me to comport better with the other qualifiers 'dicht', 'fischreich', 'klar', and 'ohne Zahl'. Also it could be argued that 'stet', in em- phasizing that these are year-round, rather than just rich pastures, introduces an uncharacteristically technical note into the Archbishop's greedy wish-list, whereas 'fett' characterizes him nicely. Holscher and Schone both propose several emendations, some of which seem likely to become fixtures. Holscher proposes a particularly bold solu? tion to an awkward crux in the 'Mummenschanz', which involves removing a speaker's name from its anomalous position in mid-sentence ('Doch wir ROSENKNOSPEN halten uns versteckt' H, CiCoDv, Ci) and inserting it in place of the equally anomalous stage direction 'Ausforderung' six lines above. Schone and Gaier also acknowledge the problem, but are content to move 'ROSENKNOSPEN' to the beginning of its line and retain 'Ausforderung'. Schone suggests several emendations in his commentary, but his diplomatic principle does not allow him to promote them to the text proper. At line 6512 he suggests reassigning the words 'Das MaB ist voll' from the Poet to Duena. This would require the words to have a disapproving tone, rather than being an empathizing comment by the lecherous Poet ('he's had his fill'), which seems preferable to me. At line 8510 he plausibly suggests emending 'Stelle' (H) to the less obvious and more 'Greek' 'Schwelle' (Hi, H2). At line 8578 he ex- presses a preference for Hi's 'heim' over H's 'hin' (although the Hi reading is not clear). At line 8776 he proposes emending 'schlachterzogne' (H, Ci) to 'schlechterzogne' (Hi, H2, HIII), noting that line 9004 states that it is twenty years since the Trojan War, so the Chorus could not have been 'educated by (or in) battle' and still be called a 'junge Brut' by Phorkyas. In the context of the line 'schlachterzogne' is repetitious ('kriegerzeugte, schlachterzogne'), but it is also more specific than the arguably somewhat feeble 'schlechterzogne'. At other points Schone breaks his diplomatic principle and in the process undermines his argument against using CiCoDv. At line 4761 he emends H's 'getreuen Lieben' to CiCoDv's 'Getreuen, Lieben' for the sake of consistency with line 4728, as do Gaier and Holscher. At line 5955 Schone, Holscher, and Gaier prefer CiCoDv's 'sich eingeschnurt' to H's 'sinnwidrig' (Schone) 'ihn eingeschnurt'. At line 6552 Schone accepts the traditional emendation 'Strand' (H48) in preference to 'Stand' (H, Ci) on grounds of sense (see 'Wog' und Welle', 1. 6551). Holscher's examination of the manuscripts reveals that H48 reads 'Strand' (and not unclearly, as Schmidt had claimed), and that H60 abbreviates to 'Stnd', whence the incorrect 'Stand' is easily explicable. Gaier</page><page sequence="16">MATTHEW BELL 649 reads 'Stand' without comment. At line 7260 Schone and Holscher accept H74's 'menschenahnlichs' for H's 'menschlich ahnlichs' (retained by Gaier). Also inexplicably retained by Gaier is H's 'kramt ihr in den Kaiserschatz' (1. 10818), where Schone and Holscher read H8's 'in dem'. All of these emendations seem desirable; all are in the Weimarer Ausgabe. There are several differences between Schone and Holscher, some of them significant. At line 4625 Schone retains H's 'verlebtem Graus' and glosses 'verlebt' awkwardly as either 'survived' or 'past' (referring to the terror itself), where Holscher and Gaier follow CiCoDv's and Ci's much simpler 'erlebtem'. At line 4965 Schone defends H's 'Jupiter' against Ci's and CiCoDv's 'Luna fein' on the grounds that 'Jupiter' is not nonsense. While in his fourth edi? tion Schone is able to refute Holscher's claim that Jupiter and silver do not belong together, it is hard to see why this should carry much weight, given that 'Luna fein' is better astrology and the change is very unlikely to have been unauthorized.22 At lines 5158-61 Holscher reads 'sehet [. . .] wollen [. . .] mag' (Goethe's corrections in CiCoDv) for H's inferior 'mogen [. . .] sollen [. . .] will', retained by Schone. At line 5730 Holscher reads CiCoDv's 'geb' in place of H's nonsensical 'gab', which Schone keeps. At line 5793 Schone cites CiCoDv's correction of 'fuhle' to the stronger and more specific 'furchte', but keeps the former. At line 5810 Holscher reads 'engen Kreis' (CiCoDv), where Schone reads H's odd 'strengen Kreis'. At line 8374 Holscher reads 'wegt und regt' (autograph correction in H69), where Schone reads H's 'wagt und regt', construing 'wagen' as 'to move up or down (in the scales)'. Holscher plausibly suggests that 'wagt' resulted from a mishearing of Goethe's Frankfurt accent. In the stage direction at the beginning of Act IV Schone keeps H's odd 'starke, zackige Gipfel' in preference to Ci's 'starre', in support of which Holscher cites paralipomenon 180's 'Vierter Akt. Starres Gebirge'. At line 11160 Schone re? jects Hi's 'fremdem' as a 'conjecture', whereas it is in fact a manuscript variant. Schone argues that the plural 'fremden' is needed because the biblical original refers to the Canaanites, implying that Goethe always cites the Bible accurately. Holscher rejects 'fremden' as an error of agreement with 'ist'. As I have argued elsewhere, the singular 'fremdem', referring to the 'Kirchlein', is appropri? ate because the speech's starting point and central idea is Faust's antagonism towards religion and the discomfort it causes him: Das Glockchen lautet auf der Diine. FAUST auffahrend. Verdammtes Lauten!

(11. 11151-62) The 'Schauder' surely refers to Faust's fear of the church and not any fear of the innocuous, elderly Philemon and Baucis.23 There are three significant cases where the balance of the argument is ex? tremely fine. At line 11513 Schone prefers the description of the lemures as 'aus Ligamenten und Gebein | Geflickte Halbnaturen' to the traditional read? ing 'aus Bandern, Sehnen und Gebein'. According to the Weimarer Ausgabe, in H 'Bandern, Sehnen' is corrected to 'Ligamenten', over which a strip of paper reading 'Ligamenten' has then been glued (on the reverse of this is 'Ligamen? ten' in mirror writing), before finally a new strip with 'Bandern, Sehnen' has been added. Schone suggests, however, that whoever collated the manuscript for the Weimarer Ausgabe removed the strips and then confused their sequence when sticking them back in place, thus causing the mirror writing to appear. Following line 11831 Schone inserts verses from the H2 paralipomenon (as did the Weimarer Ausgabe). Holscher, omitting the extra verses, argues that they disrupt the pattern set in the previous verses of a passage of Mephistopheles' complaint alternating with a verse (between eight and eleven lines long) of the Angels' chorus. As Schone notes, in the earlier alternations Mephistopheles always responds to the Angels in some way; it is only here, assuming the verses are omitted, that he does not. Finally at line 12109 Schone prefers H's original reading 'ist es' to the correction 'ists', arguing that the rhythmic irregularity of 'ist es' reflects the Chorus's amazed reaction to the impossibility it is describing. As Michelsen has noted, however, 'ist es' is not necessarily to be pronounced as two syllables, since Goethe sometimes writes 'es' when a syncope is clearly required by the metre. There are three points at which Schone seems to me to give a better read? ing than Holscher. At line 10439 Schone reverses Eckermann's conjecture of 'Nekromant' in favour of H's and C4i's 'Negromant', arguing that Goethe may have been aware ofthe Renaissance distinction between black magic ('nig- romancy') and magical communion with the dead ('necromancy') and citing parallels in the manuscript and 1818 edition of Goethe's translation of Ben- venuto Cellini. At line 10556 Schone emends H's 'aufgeraumt' to H6's and H2o's 'ausgeraumt' (as does Gaier). At line 10901 Schone prefers H2o's (cor? rected) plural '-speisen' to H's singular '-speise', which Holscher retains. In summary, all three editions of the text represent improvements on the Weimarer Ausgabe and Hamburger Ausgabe, which have now been conclu- sively superseded. The new collation of H yields several improved readings. Schone's (intermittently observed) diplomatic principle is problematic, in the? ory and in practice. Holscher's more pragmatic approach produces better re- sults overall; the Munchner Ausgabe contains what must now be regarded as the best text of Faust II. Both Schone's and Gaier's texts ofthe Urfaust, Faust I, and Faust II contain a sprinkling of odd and off-putting readings. 23 Matthew Bell, 'Sorge, Epicurean Psychology, and the Classical Faust', OGS, 28 (1999), 82- 130 (pp. 126-27).</page><page sequence="18">MATTHEW BELL 651 The commentaries by Schone, Gaier, and Holscher-Lohmeyer are so rich in material that it is impossible to do them justice here. I shall confine myself to giving a taste of what they have to offer and indicating what appear to me to be the strengths and weaknesses of each commentator's approach. The form of the commentaries is broadly similar. As well as the traditional line-by-line commentary, they offer extensive comments on whole scenes. The line-by- line commentaries are thus encapsulated within scene-by-scene commentaries, which does not always make the former easier to use. This is especially true of the Munchner Ausgabe, which presents the paralipomena and sources at the beginning of each scene, and gives detailed interpretative paraphrases of each section. Gaier gives extensive interpretative help, but consigns much of this to a second volume of 'Lesarten', as he terms them, where the interpretation does not swamp the commentary. Still, Gaier does include summaries of the interpretative material in brief essays at the beginning of each act and scene. Thus the line-by-line commentary on Act III of Faust II, for instance, is preceded by thirty-seven pages of other material. Some of the scene-by-scene commentary is very helpful, especially Holscher-Lohmeyer's summaries of Faust IFs metre, which might more conveniently have been put in an appendix. One ofthe main tasks ofthe commentaries is to gloss unusual or now obsolete usages. Much use is made of Adelung and Grimm, but there is surprisingly little comparative reference to Goethe's own usage elsewhere, although the Weimarer Ausgabe on CD-ROM has made this so easy. Gaier provides a glossary of names which is particularly helpful when reading Acts II and III of Faust II. The commentaries come into their own when giving contextualizing illus- tration. In the type of material they use, there is much that the three com- mentators have in common but more that separates them, a sign perhaps of increasing specialization in literary studies. Schone is particularly strong on the German literary tradition and Goethe's immediate socio-historical context. He offers many illuminating observations on Goethe's intellectual and mate? rial culture, such as his note on the smelling salts in the scene 'Dom'. Gaier's interests are primarily philosophical. He commands an exceptionally detailed knowledge of Renaissance philosophical and mystical-alchemical literature. A recurrent theme of his commentary is the importance for Goethe (from the 1780s) of Marsilio Ficino's Renaissance Neoplatonism. He has a keen eye for large-scale intertextual relationships. His commentary is altogether more am? bitious critically than Schone's or Holscher-Lohmeyer's, yet it also tends to force Faust into a single systematic philosophy, such as when Gaier writes of '[die] im Faust omniprasente Lehre von den sieben Geistern Gottes' of Ficino (Kommentar I, p. 641). Holscher-Lohmeyer's main source of contextualizing material is Goethe's own scientific writing. Indeed, her commentary has much in common with her earlier study of Faust IFs scientific themes in Faust und die Welt.2A Again there is a tendency to read Faust as an allegory. These biases lead to quite different readings ofthe text. Gaier reads the early parts of Faust I in the context of Renaissance mysticism. His Faust tries to follow in the footsteps of Paracelsus and Agrippa von Nettesheim. The source 24 Faust und die Welt: Der zweite Teil der Dichtung. Eine Anleitung zum Lesen des Textes (Munich: Beck, 1975).</page><page sequence="19">652 Three Recent Editions of Goethe's 'Faust' ofthe tragedy of Faust is, crudely put, a failure to follow Agrippa's instructions in magic. When Faust sees the sign of the Erdgeist, he appears to be follow? ing Agrippa's idea of three types of inspiration (Kommentar I, p. 139). This reading depends on what appears to me a misreading of line 460, 'Wie anders wirkt dies Zeichen auf mich ein!', where Gaier reads 'anders' as meaning 'in different ways', i.e. the three ways described by Agrippa. The sense of 'anders' is surely that the sign of the Erdgeist has a wholly different effect on Faust from that of the Macrocosm. Gaier further suggests that the inspiration Faust receives from the Erdgeist is a consequence of his having viewed the sign of the Macrocosm, whereas the text makes it clear that the Macrocosm has little effect on Faust. This is essential for the meaning ofthe 'Gelehrtentragodie' as a whole and the contrasts that structure it: cold sight vs. warm feeling, contem- plation vs. activity. Gaier's interest in magic also produces a strange reading of Mephistopheles' transformation from a poodle into a 'fahrender Scolast', a result, Gaier argues, not of Mephistophelean trickery, of Mephistopheles wanting to suggest to Faust that Faust can deal with him on equal terms, but of Faust's failure to recognize the evil and destructive nature of the Devil. Faust anthropomorphizes Mephistopheles. Consequently he cannot appreciate how destructive Mephistopheles will be. Gaier speculates that as a child Goethe would have read in Agrippa about the metamorphosis of a dog into a human and its associated implications for the philosopher and that Faust ignores this important knowledge (p. 218; see also pp. 297, 300, 303). The problem with this approach is that it makes an understanding of Faust's tragedy significantly dependent on a reader having the kind of detailed knowledge of Agrippa that Gaier claims Goethe had. It turns Faust into a hermetic text. Schone is sceptical about this material. Whereas Gaier sources the Erdgeist from Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Swedenborg, Schone interestingly suggests that Goethe drew on Hederich's account of the Daemogorgon. Schone is only in? terested in magic and alchemy in so far as it contributes to the sense of a gener- ational conflict. Faust is a representative of a younger generation that wants to free itself from the shackles forged by its elders and so resorts to the 'alternative' science of alchemy. Schone also sees Faust as a response to the secularization of Western society. Faust represents 'das "verlorene Ich" einer glaubenslosen, tief skeptischen Neuzeit' (FA, 1, vii/2, 210). Intertextual allusions to Haller's Die Falschheit menschlicher Tugenden associate Faust with the figure of Newton, the ultimate representative of secular modernity (FA, 1, vii/2, 211). For Schone, Faust's descent into the wager with Mephistopheles is both an expression of his melancholy (FA, 1, vii/2, 244) and an allegory of secular? ization, with the curse speech (11. 1583-1606) marking both an emotional low point and his final 'Abfall vom Christentum' (FA, 1, vii/2, 257). The much- discussed speech beginning 'Was willst du armer Teufel geben?' (11. 1675- 85) is construed by Schone as a 'hohnende Feststellung' (FA, 1, vii/2, 159). Schone follows all editions published in Goethe's lifetime in reading a full stop at the end of line 1685. The following couplet ('Zeig' mir die Frucht die fault, eh' man sie bricht, | Und Baume die sich taglich neu begrunen!') is a 'verzweifelt-resignierende Aufforderung' with which Faust sardonically confirms to himself that the world and even Mephistopheles have nothing to of-</page><page sequence="20">MATTHEW BELL 653 fer him. Gaier reads the speech differently. Faust does actually want to be shown things that promise but fail to deliver satisfaction, because that will confirm his belief in ceaseless striving. Schone sees the wager as a piece of unconscious legalistic trickery. Mephistopheles wants a traditional pact, but Faust takes it in a new direction. The wager he offers is asymmetrical: Mephistopheles will serve him, but whether or not Faust then belongs to Mephistopheles remains open (FA, 1, vn/2, 260). What Faust says after the formal agreement simply adds to the confusion, as he appears to revert to a more traditional conception. The obscurity of the wager's meaning is what makes the understanding between two characters with such different expectations possible in the first place. Gaier also emphasizes the modernity of Faust's consciousness, but in a dif? ferent way. Faust's aim in the wager is 'alle Dinge zu werden' in a manner described by Ficino (Kommentar I, p. 237). In this modern version ofthe pact, the conventions ofthe traditional pact are parodied. Thus the function of Faust as a 'Warndrama' is largely destroyed. Mephistopheles is not recognized for what he is (p. 243). Hence, whereas Schone thinks Mephistopheles is mistaken about the wager, Gaier thinks it is Faust who is mistaken. To emphasize Faust's modernity, Gaier cites a passage from Rousseau's Reveries that appears to have provided the idea for Faust's focus on time ('Werd' ich zum Augenblicke sagen'): modern man sees time as movement; there is no static point in the modern world. The treatment of Gretchen is a feature of the new commentaries that clearly sets them apart from Trunz and earlier commentators. Schone follows the recent tendency to see Gretchen as neither particularly innocent nor grounded in her social class. At the same time he stresses her independence from Faust's patronizing image of her and calls her Margarete, not Gretchen. Hence her rejection of Faust's first advances is not awkward naivety but contains some 'Koketterie' (FA, 1, vn/2, 289). Schone's concern with the material culture of Faust's and Gretchen's world led him astray at one point in the first edition. He suggested that in the scene 'Abend' Gretchen's entrance carrying a lamp signalled that she was returning from a visit to the outdoor lavatory, when in fact, as Kassel has pointed out, she was returning from talking to Marthe. In other respects the social detail is brought out to good effect. For instance, it appears that Gretchen's mother is a moneylender, as well as a religious bigot (FA, 1, vn/2, 296). The 'Gretchenfrage' is an expression of Gretchen's concern that Faust is a lost soul (FA, 1, vii/2, 322). But she is not naive about Faust's evasive pantheistic hymn (FA, 1, vii/2, 325). Schone also rejects the traditional view that Faust is a victim of Mephistophelean trickery and gives the sleeping potion to Gretchen in good faith. Schone's Faust knows that the potion is a Devil's brew. Line 3511 ('Drei Tropfen nur . . .') is intentionally ambiguous: does Faust mean that three drops is all it will take to put her mother to sleep or that Gretchen must not use more than three drops? Gaier takes the revision of Gretchen even further, stressing the intertextual links to Moliere's Domjuan and Lessing's Emilia Galotti. (It is disappointing to find nothing in either commentary about one ofthe most important intertextual models for the 'Gretchentragodie', Romeo andjuliet.) Gretchen thus comes to represent the conflicts in the bourgeois psyche, determined to assert its own</page><page sequence="21">654 Three Recent Editions of Goethe's 'Faust' values but also fatally attracted by the lure ofthe seeming aristocrat. The world of Gretchen and Faust is that of an 'altdeutsche Stadt' in the late Middle Ages. Gretchen is two people: the pure and upright Margarete and the 'verfuhrend- verfuhrt' Gretchen (Kommentar I, p. 329). Gaier provocatively argues that the name Gretchen has connotations of prostitution (p. 330). Her song 'Es war ein Konig in Thule' contains an intertextual tension with Desdemona's song in Othello. Desdemona's song shows the tragic reality of this kind of relationship, so the intertextuality emphasizes Gretchen's deluded state. Whether the refer? ence to Othello is needed to bring out the flaw in Gretchen's thinking is, I would argue, debatable, for this is a common motif in the contemporary biirgerliches Trauerspiel. Gaier rightly points out that the 'Gretchenfrage' is not just about religion: it is also about whether Faust will be a faithful lover like the King of Thule. An excellent note on line 3569 shows that in Goethe's time the practice of public 'KirchenbuBe' was still an issue in Protestant (but not Catholic!) Ger? many. This nicely reveals the syncretism in the make-up of Gretchen's world: it is not a world or even a form of Christianity that ever really existed. At the end of the scene Kerker Gaier goes so far as to argue that Mephistopheles' 'Sie ist gerichtet!' expresses the view of the Church (Kommentar I, p. 523). Religious matters in Faust I are treated fully and to excellent effect by both Schone and Gaier. Schone's treatment of the 'Walpurgisnacht' has been much discussed, since his proposal for a reading version appeared in his study Gotterzeichen, Liebes- zauber, Satanskult.2S In the 1790s the militantly anti-Christian Goethe appears to have planned a Satan-worship scene, which ultimately became the victim of self-censorship. Schone has organized the surviving fragments into what he believes the planned scenes would have looked like. This involves substantial editing not only ofthe paralipomena, but also ofthe published 'Walpurgisnacht' material. Aside from general criticisms ofthe idea of reconstructing unfinished scenes in this way, it has been pointed out that Schone's version puts the paralipomena in the wrong order.26 The tenor of the material is not in doubt, however. Its guiding idea seems to be parody of and satire on Christianity, and the bulk of the material seems to have been written in 1797, the year of the ballads, when Goethe's anti-Christian animus was at its peak.27 Schone also observes that the published 'Walpurgisnacht' contains a reprise of themes that first emerge in 'Hexenkiiche'. Like the latter scene, it is 'eine ins Groteske, Absurde, Chaotische und wiist Obszone ausgreifende Hexenoper' (FA, 1, vu/2, 342). However, he regards the published 'Walpurgisnacht' as fatally damaged by the omission of the Satan-worship and parodic satanic judgement scenes that were to have been its climax, the appearance of Satan corresponding to and 'answering' the appearance of the Lord in the 'Prolog im Himmel'. Gaier makes less of anti-Christian elements in the 'Walpurgisnacht' and more of its literary and philosophical import. The Faust tradition before Goethe al? ready features a Blocksberg scene, in J. F. Lowen's Die Walpurgisnacht: Ein 25 Gotterzeichen, Liebeszauber, Satanskult: Neue Einblicke in alte Goethetexte (Munich: Beck, 1982). 26 Gaier, Kommentar I, pp. 454-55. 27 Reiner Wild, Goethes klassische Lyrik (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1999), p. 223.</page><page sequence="22">MATTHEW BELL 655 Gedicht in drey Gesdngen of 1756 (Kommentar I, p. 451). Like Goethe, Lowen uses the Walpurgisnacht as an opportunity for satire on contemporary litera? ture. However, unlike Schone, who sees the world of the 'Walpurgisnacht' as a satire on Goethe's world, Gaier sees it as an upside-down version of Faust and Gretchen's world. Faust's world is organized from the top down (like Ficino's!), whereas this world is organized from the bottom up. It is a 'Gegenwelt' to the world of Faust I, and its meaning is a 'Gegensinn' (p. 485). This leads to an odd reading of the 'grau und schwarze Bruderschaft' in the 'Hochgerichtser- scheinung' (paralipomenon 69 line 3). Schone sees these figures as Franciscan and Dominican monks, the theoretical and practical wings of the Inquisition, and thus as a continuation of Faust J's attack on the Catholic Church. Gaier, however, sees them as devils or magicians (p. 464). This is confirmed for him by the underlying intertextual relation of the 'Walpurgisnacht' to the magical atmosphere of A Midsummer Night's Dream (pp. 487-93). Like the interlude in Shakespeare's play, the 'Intermezzo' in Goethe's is intentionally bad poetry and bad theatre (p. 488). At several points Gaier's pursuit of intertextual meanings leads to strained interpretations. From the 'Walpurgisnacht' to the 'Klassische Walpurgisnacht' is a small step in Schone's commentary. The two are connected by their chaotic form and dream-like atmosphere. The later scene is designed to reprise the themes of the earlier. Schone rightly notes that the classicism ofthe 'Klassische Walpur? gisnacht' is not of the noble and serene Winckelmannian kind. Its mood and personnel are very diverse, in parts it is unintelligible, and as a whole it seems in? tentionally mysterious (FA, 1, vn/2, 522-23). Indeed, it is conceivable, Schone argues, that the whole thing is simply imagined in Faust's mind, just as the 'Walpurgisnacht' takes Faust into 'die Traum- und Zaubersphare' (1. 3871). Ultimately its ontological status is not decidable. Its guiding idea is that Faust, Mephistopheles, and Homunculus all find their own element, sexually speak - ing. The movement of the whole episode is towards water, and its main action is Homunculus's quest for physical existence in the origin of all life in water. Holscher-Lohmeyer gives a brilliant account of the 'Klassische Walpurgis? nacht', drawing on her deep knowledge of Goethe's scientific writings. The artistic function of the scenes has to be seen in the context of the polarity of the Gothic and the Classical that runs through the central Acts of Faust II. The artificial, disembodied Homunculus and the dreaming Faust represent Gothic artifice, against which is set the natural and concrete creativity of the classical world. In contrast to Schone, Holscher-Lohmeyer sees the 'Klassische Walpurgisnacht' as the antithesis ofthe 'Walpurgisnacht'. The witches' magic is opposed by the magic of nature; Mephistopheles as the spirit of evil is an? swered by Mephistopheles as a spirit of ugliness; the magical spirits of Faust I give way to elemental spirits (MA, xviii/i, 824). These are not just representa- tives of ancient myth: they also allegorize Goethe's own scientific views (MA, xviii/i, 825). As a whole the scenes represent the process of the creation of life or in Faust's case the reawakening of life. Gaier sees the Klassische Walpurgisnacht as exemplifying a polarity of the spiritual and the temporal-spatial. Homunculus is the universal intellect as envisaged by Ficino. This is an unconvincing interpretation: for one thing, Ho-</page><page sequence="23">656 Three Recent Editions of Goethe's 'Faust' munculus is represented as limited; he only becomes capable of occupying space when dissolved in the sea. Also strange is Gaier's treatment of 'Telchinen von Rhodus' (after 1. 8274) as a scene title. If this is correct, then it is anomalous, as the other scene titles are all locations. Even more bizarre is Gaier's iden? tification of Eros ('So herrsche denn Eros der alles begonnen!', 1. 8479) with Mephistopheles, on the grounds that Eros Phanes, the creator of the universe in some Greek cosmogonies, is the equivalent of Lucifer in Christian myth, both being sons of Chaos (Kommentar I, p. 819). One intractable local problem is the meaning ofthe 'Mutter' in Act I. Are these figures to be taken seriously? If so, how do they relate to the whole classical paraphernalia of Act II, which seems to be responsible for the resurrection of Helen? As she appears in Act I, Helen is only a Mephistophelean phantasm, as in the 'Hexenkiiche'. In both cases Faust fails victim to Mephistopheles' magic, which nearly destroys him. Are the 'Mutter' a Mephistophelean hoax? Goethe claimed that his sole source for the 'Mutter' was Plutarch (in conversation with Eckermann, 10 January 1830). Gaier cites a range of other possible sources, including Gottfried Arnold, Agrippa, Bohme, Swedenborg, and Ficino. Having thus established the ancestry of the notion of the mothers, he reads them (seriously) as representing a principle of transformation and hence as central to the meaning of Act I as a whole (Kommentar I, pp. 639-42). Holscher- Lohmeyer on the other hand sees them as an allegory of an aesthetic process. Faust has promised the Emperor that he will produce Helen, the 'Urform' of human beauty. Since in Goethe's view beauty is a product of nature according to secret laws, the 'Mutter' are a poetic fiction representing the forms of nature (MA, xviii/i, 744-61). Schone also sees in the 'Mutter' a key Goethean idea, but 'ironisch gebrochen, satirisch eingefarbt' (FA, 1, vn/2, 468). He cites an illuminating passage from Plutarch's On the Decline of the Oracles (not the source Goethe mentioned to Eckermann) that talks of a space between the existing worlds which knows no time and where the original forms of things reside. This seems to me the most persuasive of the interpretations of the 'Mutter'. But if Schone makes a better case than Gaier and Holscher-Lohmeyer for taking them seriously, he is also less prepared than they to do so. The historical and political meaning of Acts I and IV is a major theme in all three commentaries. Holscher-Lohmeyer sees Act I as a representation of an ancien regime court (MA, xviii/i, 652). However, Goethe's purpose is not primarily historical: it is rather to show humans as 'triebhaft' beings who strive to fulfil their image of themselves and the world. Faust and Mephistopheles enact this by means of the introduction of paper money and the conjuring of Paris and Helen. These represent two great innovations characteristic of modernity: the creation of new wealth and new forms of entertainment (MA, xviii/i, 653). With the innovations comes the collapse of the medieval world. In addition there is perhaps a reflection on recent history, for the indiscipline ofthe young Emperor's court in Act I leads to the rebellion ofthe Gegenkaiser in Act IV, thus reflecting Goethe's view ofthe causes ofthe French Revolution. Admittedly it is unclear whether there is continuity between the two acts and whether this is even the same Emperor. Paralipomenon 178 shows that Goethe did at one stage intend this, but Holscher-Lohmeyer argues against a strict</page><page sequence="24">MATTHEW BELL 657 causal connection between Acts I and IV. Instead they are united by the idea of 'Herrschaft': the Emperor's dominion is questioned by the Gegenkaiser, and Faust and the Church compete for dominion over land and money. Again, how? ever, Goethe's primary interest is not in a historical process but in 'Herrschaft' as an expression of 'Dasein in Tatigkeit' (MA, xviii/i, 1024-26). Schone also sees historical transition as the key to Act I. According to Goethe's 1816 summary ofthe as yet largely unwritten Faust II, Faust would appear before Emperor Maximilian I in Augsburg or, according to Falk, in Frankfurt at the time of the coronation. These specifics of place, time, and identity do not appear in the completed work, which also omits some arguably necessary psychological linking material (FA, 1, vii/2, 397-98). This is because Goethe wants to generalize, to represent the transition from a feudal to a civil society. The unifying idea of Act I is the idea ofthe artificial and fictive (paper money and Helen). The paper-money plot is played out in Act I, but the Helen theme continues to be important in the subsequent acts. In Act IV key themes are provided by motifs from meteorology and geology. This is signalled at the beginning of the scene 'Hochgebirg' by Faust's arrival at the 'starke [sie] za- ckige Gipfel' (geology) on a cloud (meteorology). Mephistopheles is associated with the Vulcanist geology that Goethe found uncongenial. Schone links this to Goethe's response to the revolution of 1830. The world is subject to the constant threat of upheaval. The Emperor is restored, but only with the help of Mephistopheles' Vulcanist magic and on a shaky constitutional basis. Faust, by contrast, wants to found a durable Neptunian empire on land reclaimed from the sea, though Goethe's deep social and political scepticism makes even this undertaking impossible (FA, 1, vii/2, 652-53). Gaier sees the key to Act I in the idea that 'Alles kann der Edle leisten, | Der versteht und rasch ergreift' (11. 4664-65; Kommentar I, p. 526). He puts less emphasis on history. The dominant perspective in Act I is the 'magische Lesart', and its action exemplifies Ficino's third 'Strebung' ofthe soul. Magic leads to a belief in the impossible; at the same time many things in the modern world result from magic (pp. 532-33). Historically, Goethe conflates the Holy Roman Emperors Maximilian I, Charles IV, and Francis I. This is not a re? presentation of the late medieval world; rather it is intended as an allegory of the Wars of Coalition against Napoleon, in which the Emperor's power and finances were severely weakened. Similarly Act IV is an allegory of the un- dermining of the Empire. Whereas in Act I the focus was on magic, here the 'okonomische Lesart' comes to the fore. Act IV is therefore characterized by Ficino's sixth 'Strebung' of the soul after the ultimate in power and riches (Kommentar I, p. 931; Kommentar II, p. 582). The commentators' accounts of 'Bergschluchten' reveal deep disagreement about Faust's final trajectory. Schone gives an illuminating and persuasive account of the final scene. Noting that the 'Prolog im Himmel' with its talk of striving and activity is exclusively male, Schone suggests a contrast with the feminine metaphysics in 'Bergschluchten', where Christ is notable by his absence. The main characteristic of the female divine is redeeming love. It is not Faust's power alone that wins salvation. This leads into a discussion of Origen's notion of the apokatastasis panton and its influence on the scene. In</page><page sequence="25">658 Three Recent Editions of Goethe's 'Faust' Origen's Platonist view, salvation consists in purification; Faust's 'entelechy' is to be purified. In this process all beings help one another: so Faust will teach the Selige Knaben. However, the whole business is 'mystisch und unaussprechlich' (in Gottfried Arnold's words) and ends with a reminder that what is being represented is 'unbeschreiblich' (FA, 1, vn/2, 795). Holscher-Lohmeyer's emphasis is not on salvation but continued activity. 'Bergschluchten' embodies a quintessentially modern idea, Spinoza's God- Nature. She rejects the idea that Origen's thinking forms a 'transzendierendes Theologoumenon' (MA, xviii/i, 1176). Goethe lacks Origen's moral purpose. Faust's transformation is not a rejection of his former 'impure' state, but a 'Steigerung' of his living potential. Goethe's 'heaven' envisages no end of time, rather time is cyclical (MA, xviii/i, 1167-68), and the cosmology owes more to the Platonism of Plotinus than that of Origen. Gaier's view is closer to Holscher-Lohmeyer's than to Schone's. For him the form of 'Bergschluchten' is Christian, but not its content. Goethe's syncretism forbids any identification of the ending with Christian doctrine (MA, xviii/i, 1125). In any case, the process that Faust's soul undergoes is not one of purification at all, but of ever- increasing activity (MA, xviii/i, 1121). Having rebutted Schone's argument in his comments on the angels' chorus in 'Grablegung', Gaier's commentary on 'Bergschluchten' does not even mention Origen. Instead Ficino looms large again. Faust's soul has achieved love, through which, Gaier claims, it gains a self-reflexive element. With this it has reached the highest state of earthly existence and can now progress to the next of Ficino's five stages of being (Kommentar I, p. 1146). I hope to have given some impression of the richness and diversity of the three commentaries. Each contains large quantities of new and original ma? terial. They will all be valuable resources for future research. None of them, however, can claim to be the standard work, largely thanks to the originality of the others. Indeed, even taken as a whole the three commentaries do not represent the final word on Faust. If anything they show the need for more words, by testifying to the work's enormous density and diversity of allusion, which exceeds the capacity of any one scholar to find and digest. Moreover, the attempt (or temptation) to give an all-embracing interpretation, which is particularly evident in Holscher-Lohmeyer's and Gaier's commentaries, has to confront the highly elliptical and abbreviated character of the text. Even the sections of Faust II that appear to have been over-elaborated are marked by these Pindaric 'Spninge und Wiirfe', such as the absence from the end of Act IV of a scene in which the Emperor formally confers honours or the extraordinary transition from the end of Act II to the beginning of Act III or the lack of ex? plicit continuity between Acts I and IV It is in these two senses?allusiveness and elusiveness?that the incommensurability of Faust surely consists.
