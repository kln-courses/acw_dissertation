<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANALYSIS AND AMS DATING OF THE GREAT GALLERY FOOD AND TOOL BAG PHIL R. GEIB AND MICHAEL R. ROBINS ABSTRACT Here we present a detailed analysis and description of a leather bag and its con- tents. The find came from the Great Gallery in Horseshoe Canyon, Utah, an impres- sive rock art site within Canyonlands National Park. The bag contained marsh elder (Iva xanthifolia Nutt.) seeds and an assortment of flakes and other artifacts that appear related to arrow point production. The bag was made and cached at the site sometime during the interval of cal. A.D. 770-970. This age assignment is based on the average of three AMS radiocarbon dates on separate components of the bag. RESUMEN Aquf presentamos un andlisis detallado de la descripcitn de una bolsa de piel y su con- tenido. El hallazgo proviene del la Gran Galeria del Canon de la Herradura (Horshoe Canyon) en Utah, un sitio impresionante de arte rupestre dentro del Parque Nacional Canyonlands. Este bolso contenfa semillas de sauco del pantano (Iva xanthifolia Nutt), varias hojuelas y otros artefactos que parecen estar relacionados con la producci6n de cabezas de flecha. La bolsa fue echa y escondida en este sitio durante el intervalo de cal. (770-970 d.C.). La designaci6n de esta fecha fue producida basada en el promedio de tres andlisis de radiocarbono AMS sobre diferentes articulos del bolso. n 2005, Sam and Ashley Grimes of Utah were visiting the Great Gallery, an internationally known rock art site within a remote portion of Can- yonlands National Park. While at the site, they discovered a leather bag eroding from eolian sand. Recognizing that this might be a potentially significant find, the visitors notified a seasonal park ranger, Heidi Blankenship, who happened to be leading a tour to the site. Fearing unlawful removal of the bag, the ranger re- covered the item on the day of its discovery. We obtained the bag and its contents on loan from the National Park Service (NPS) to conduct the analysis reported here. Because of the Grimes's selfless action and concern for preservation, every- one can enjoy both the objects and the insights to the past that they provide-a personal find has become a public good.

ROBINS The Great Gallery lies in Horseshoe Canyon, also known as Barrier Canyon, west of the confluence of the Green and Colorado rivers in southeastern Utah (Figure 1). On U.S. Geological Survey maps the name "Barrier" is only applied to the creek of Horseshoe Canyon, which has a seasonal flow. The canyon trends northeastward, draining into the Green River and provides a ready travel passage- way through the imposing sandstone cliffs of the deeply entrenched river corri- dor. Barrier Canyon has been adopted as the name for a rock art style that the Great Gallery epitomizes (Schaafsma 1971). Barrier Canyon Style rock art is char- acterized by large anthropomorphic pictographs that have a ghostlike quality because they usually consist of elongated, shouldered torsos with heads that lack arms or legs (Figure 2). In the Spur Fork tributary of Horseshoe Canyon, upstream from the Great Gallery, lies Cowboy Cave, a hugely significant site because of its great time depth and wonderful preservation of organic remains (Jennings 1980; Schroedl and Coulam 1994). The cave yielded several hide bags (Hull 1980): two of whole marmot skins filled with corn dated to around cal.

B.C. at 2-sigma). This cave and the adjacent Walters Cave yielded day figurines that are closely comparable to Barrier Canyon pictographs from strata dating to the Early Archaic (Coulam and Schroedl 1996), raising the possibility that some images of the Great Gallery are at least 6,000-7,000 years old (Schaafsma 1986: 225; Schroedl 1989:17). Direct dating of some elements of this style, including one image of the Great Gallery, suggests a maximal age of only about 3,000 years (Tipps 1995). GENERAL DESCRIPTION Figure 3 shows the bag as it appeared shortly after removal from the ground. The bag, which measures about 25 cm long (ca. 35 cm long when extended) and 8- 10 cm in diameter, rests upon seeds that had spilled from the lower portion through a fresh rent. The bag had been separated into two compartments by wrapping the middle with a leather strap. Prior to being wrapped, the bottom of the bag had been filled with marsh elder seeds, the volume of which was roughly the size of a softball (perhaps these are the seeds that remained after consuming</page><page sequence="4">294 PHIL R. GEIB AND MICHAEL R. ROBINS FIGURE 3. The bag shortly after recovery; it rests upon seeds that had spilled from the lower portion. the amount that once filled the bag entirely). After wrapping the middle part to secure the seeds, three small leather pouches and a small water-rounded stone were placed within the upper part. These pouches are partially visible through the older weathered rent in the hide. Two pouches were empty, but the third con- tained 40 chipped stone flakes, a biface, and a pressure-flaking tool of shaped antler. The mouth of the bag had been secured the same way as the middle part, by wrapping it with a leather strap. The bag and all pouches appear to be made of antelope hide.</page><page sequence="5">ANALYSIS AND AMS DATING 295 HIDE ARTIFACTS THE OUTER BAG The outer bag was fabricated from a single rectangular piece of tanned hide with the hair removed (the hide appears to have been prepared by scraping it when dry rather than wet). Based on traces of hair that remain in a few places and on over- all thinness, the hide is probably antelope. The grain or hair side of the animal is on the bag interior, but in fabrication the reverse was true, and the bag was then pulled outside-in. The rectangular piece of leather was folded in half along its length, which measured about 35 cm; width of the hide piece was probably around 33 cm, but an accurate measurement is impossible. The folded portions were made flush along the side and an end, and the two layers were sewn together with sZ2 bast cordage using a simple running stitch, thereby producing a rectan- gular sack. (Cordage nomenclature follows Wendrich [1991:30-32], with the first letter referring to the direction of spin for yams, in this case S-spun, and the sec- ond capitalized letter referring to the direction of how the yarns were combined or plied, in this case Z-plied; the subscript number denotes how may yams were combined to form the ply.) In one place there appears to be a strand of human hair incorporated with the bast fibers, probably by accident. At this stage, the construction was pulled outside-in so that the stitched seam was on the interior. Doing so drew the stitching tight and made the seam pucker slightly, producing a wavy appearance (Figure 4b). The overall bag probably measured about 35 cm long by 15-17 cm wide when flat, but exact measurements are not possible because of the leather strips that bind the center and open end. The bag had been repaired in several places to fix linear rents by using a simple overcast (whip) stitch of bast or sinew cordage (all sZ2) sewn through pierced holes. Figures 4a and 4c show two of these repairs. There are three repairs with bast fiber cordage-one long (more than 15 cm but unmeasurable since it goes under the middle wrap) and two short (2.3 cm and 1.5 cm)-and one with sinew (1.7 cm). The sinew patch, which has five passes with overhand knots on both ends to secure the thread, was done before the bag was pulled outside-in because the knots are on the interior, an improbable location otherwise. The means of securing the threads of the other linear patches are all on the outside and consist of both overhand and figure 8 knots. For the start of the longest repair, an S-spun strand was inserted through a pierced hole and then Z-twisted together before sewing the rent closed and then ending with an overhand knot. Prior to forming the bag, a hole about 2 by 2.5 cm near the opening was patched with a small rectangular leather scrap at least 5 cm long and 4 wide (this area is partially under the closing wrap and so cannot be measured accurately). The patch was sewn to the bag interior with a simple running stitch and by being incorporated into the bag seam stitch; thus, this hole was repaired before finish- ing the bag. The sewing was done with an sZ2 bast cord.</page><page sequence="6">296 PHIL R. GEIB AND MICHAEL R.

The opposite side of the bag seen in Figure 3, along with closeup images showing construction and repair details. The bag was divided into two sections by wrapping the middle with a strap of leather. The strap, which measured between 2.5 and 3.5 cm wide, was folded in half lengthways and then wrapped around the bag's middle four or five times and pulled tight. The loose ends were secured with a single overhand knot with the ends left dangling, one longer than the other. The bag opening was similarly closed by wrapping with a leather strap and interlacing the loose ends to form an overhand knot. The leather strap in this case was about 1.4 cm wide and was wound four times around the bag before being cinched and tied. This closure was not, however, the original means of sealing the bag. That was done using sZ2 bast cordage and a simple overcast stitch with an overhand knot at the end to secure</page><page sequence="7">ANALYSIS AND AMS DATING 297 the thread against the hole in the leather, which was placed at the corner opposite the side seam. There are 14 stitch wraps still present, with the last one cut in half and missing along with some of the leather from one side. Evidently the bag was opened at some point simply by hacking into it rather than by unlacing or cutting the stitches. After this, it appears that the leather wrap was used for closure; this reduced the overall volume of the bag, but it doubtless provided more ready access (easier for repeated opening and closing). THE POUCHES Two of the three pouches from the bag are similar in construction, with a flap- type closure, whereas the third is distinctive (Figure 5). The latter was made from an unsplit (cased-out) leg section of hide, probably antelope. Conical in shape, only one end had to be sewn shut to form a bag, in this case the wider proximal portion, leaving the narrower distal part as the mouth. It measures 11.5 cm wide at bottom, 5.5 cm wide at top, and 10.5 cm high. The bottom was secured by a running stitch using sZ2 sinew cordage. Unlike the other examples, this pouch wasn't turned outside-in, so the stitching is exposed. There are 22 insertions of the cord, with both ends secured by overhand knots. The crimping of the hide at the opening suggests that this small pouch was closed with a wrap of leather or cordage much like the overall bag. This pouch was empty, and the leather was unstained except for one corner of the exterior, which was coated with a thin layer of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) pitch. The pitch had been smeared on while in a hot (melted) viscous state but before stitching the pouch bottom shut, so it probably derived from an earlier use of the hide. The pitch contained minute pieces of finely ground wood charcoal, a material that is ethnographically known to be 5 CM . . ........ ........ ..........

GEIB AND MICHAEL R. ROBINS useful as a temper to prevent the mastic from becoming too brittle, such as when using it to haft projectile points. It would appear that the corner of the pouch had been used as an expedient cloth, perhaps to protect the fingers while wiping melted pitch. Also in this comer is a short piece of sZ2 sinew cordage that runs through three holes and is knotted (overhand?) on either side of the hide to secure the strand. Because this strand does not serve to hold the two sides of the hide together its use remains unknown, but it was clearly in place before the leather had been used as a pitch rag because this short sinew cord is pitch-slathered. The two pouches with a flap-type closure were constructed by starting with a rectangular piece of leather. Roughly one-third of an end was folded and over- lain upon the middle one-third, and then the aligned edges on both sides were sewn together with simple running stitches using cordage (sZ2 sinew for one using 11-12 stitches, sZ2 yucca for the other with 13-14 stitches). The cords were secured at both ends by overhand knots pulled tight against the stitch holes, with the loose ends cut short. The stitched sides created a small pocket with the remain- ing one-third of the length as a projecting flap. The construction was then pulled outside-in so that the stitched seam (and hair side) was on the interior, making for a neat, finished look. A string was then added to the flap so that it could be wrapped around the pouch and then tied to hold the flap shut and thereby secure any contents (only the full pouch had this string still in place). The leather for both of these pouches when dry had been purposefully stained red by hematite; the interior of the empty example was so darkly stained that it probably held pieces of this ore at one time. Flakes and a shaped antler pressure flaker had been placed within the other flap-type pouch. This pouch measures about 9 cm wide, 7.4 cm high, and 3.5 cm thick with contents; the flat, empty example measures about 9.5 cm wide and 8 cm high. The closure string for the full pouch consisted of a tightly twisted and nar- row diameter (1.3 mm) sZ2 bast cord that is both red-stained and grimy and exhibits considerable wear. This string had been wrapped around the pouch and tied with a square knot (this knot had been untied by the time of our analysis, but NPS photos allow positive identification). This string was not actually attached to the flap directly but to a short string secured to a perforation in the leather 9 mm from the end of the flap. The short string was an sZ2 bast cord, but after passing through the flap both ends were brought together on the exterior side and com- bined to make a thicker cabled cord that was then secured by an overhand knot. The long closure string was tied to this flap thong by a loose overhand knot such that one side of the string was 18 cm long and the other was 29 cm long (now 28 cm because of removing a portion for AMS dating). The difference in length allowed the longer end of the string to be wrapped over the top of the pouch and the shorter end under the bottom, with both coming back together nearly even on the flap side for tying.</page><page sequence="9">ANALYSIS AND AMS DATING 299 The empty flap-type pouch lacks its closure string, but it appears to have been configured somewhat differently than the example just described. In this case there is an sZ2 bast cord attached to the center of the flap through two holes pierced 10 mm and 3 mm from the end. A cord was inserted through the top hole from the inside and pulled tight against an overhand knot. The cord was then threaded back through the bottom hole, where it is broken and frayed, so how the closure worked remains unknown. The most logical approach would have been simply to have had a string of sufficient length so that it could have been wrapped around the entire pouch one or two times after exiting the bottom hole of the flap. Unlike the full pouch, which had no holes or repairs, the leather of the empty pouch was quite worn and exhibits three holes and one tear. The leather is so heavily red-stained on the interior that this pouch may have once held ocher. Also inside is some whitish sand and one minute chert flake (microflake). The flap of this bag was as wide as the bag overall (9.5 cm) and differs from the taper- ing flap of the full pouch, which was slightly narrower than the bag. STONE ARTIFACTS USED PEBBLE Loose within the upper part of the bag, underneath the three skin pouches, was a small water-worn pebble that exhibits use-wear (Figure 6). This oval, flat, dense igneous rock (probably andesite) measures 75 x 42 x 19 mm and weighs 91.8 g. Both faces toward one end exhibit a worn area where fine striations (scratches) and abrasion have removed the patina, exposing the natural lighter color of the stone. The scratches are not oriented uniformly, occurring at various cross-cutting or intersecting angles. These wear traces are just the sort that we would expect from using the pebble to abrade the edges of flake blanks during flint knapping (platform preparation). Some slight pitting from hammerstone use is evident on the edge of the end opposite that with the facial abrasion. There is some carbon- ate buildup along one edge from when the pebble lay on an alluvial terrace some- where long before being put to service as a tool or included in the bag. The amount of use-wear on this pebble is limited but is still more than could have been produced by the minimal edge abrasion for platform preparation seen on the flake blanks and biface in the pouch. UNFINISHED BIFACE Included in the pouch with the flakes was a small unfinished ovate biface of Dubinky chert (Figure 7), the material that accounted for all but 2 of 40 flake blanks in the same pouch. The biface had been made on a thin flat flake, identical to those in the pouch; both ventral and dorsal surface attributes are still visible.</page><page sequence="10">300 PHIL R. GEIB AND MICHAEL R. ROBINS 4cm ~i .77,7 . . ....... . . . . . . . "Map .1i: 7,.. C fe cr fine scratches &amp; abrasion FIGURE 6. Igneous pebble that was loose within the upper compartment of the bag along with the pouches. This biface measures 31.5 mm long (which is also the original flake length), 20 mm wide, and 4 mm thick (also original flake thickness). Most retouch occurs on the ventral surface and was focused on the bulbar swelling, with the distal third of this surface left unmodified. The invasive flake scars efficiently thinned the proximal two-thirds of the blank; despite this, the platform surface remains par- tially intact. The flake scars are moderately broad for pressure, but this is what we would expect if using an antler bit like that included in the pouch. Pressure retouch on the dorsal surface is less extensive and invasive, mostly occurring along the proximal half of one margin. The ultimate tool form cannot be determined, but an arrow point certainly seems probable given thinness and lack of longitudinal curvature (section symmetry). FLAKE BLANKS The 40 flakes from the pouch-a number that is perhaps not random-are inter- esting for several reasons (Table 1; Figures 8 and 9). First, all but two of the flakes</page><page sequence="11">ANALYSIS AND AMS DATING 301 platform ....... ..................aaaaaaaaa : ..::::::::::::::::::::a:aaa il i ii: iii ii!?ii i iii~ii~i-iiiiii:.iiii iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii iiiiiii i iiii ventral dorsal 4cm III"... FIGURE 7. Small biface that was contained along with 40 flakes and an antler pressure flaker in the one full pouch. are of Dubinky chert, a distinctive cream and pinkish mottled silica that occurs as a lag deposit on the east side of the Green River opposite that from Horseshoe Canyon (see Figure 1). This is a linear distance of some 40 km from the Great Gallery as the crow flies, plus a few thousand meters of elevation loss and gain because of having to cross Labyrinth Canyon on the lower Green. The two flakes not of this material (see Figure 9) include one of chalcedony, likely from the Summerville Formation, and one of brown chert that might come from the Cedar Mesa Formation. Second, the flakes had been culled from the surface, presumably selected because they had desirable plan and section attributes. The flakes are differen- tially patinated, polished, and edge-rounded from variable durations of surface exposure in the desert but also exhibit more recent random nicks on the margins, perhaps largely as a result of bag transport in prehistory. The more recent nicks are easily detected because they have removed the polish and patina. A few of the flakes exhibit minute traces of carbonate accumulation on flake scars, further evi- dence of prolonged surface exposure prior to collection for inclusion in the pouch.</page><page sequence="12">302 PHIL R.

Third, the flat and thin section of virtually all flakes suggests selection for facially thinned tool forms such as bifaces. Moreover, the overall small size of the flakes is consistent with producing bifacial tools the size of arrow points. Based on this, we had predicted that the '4C dates on the cache would fall within the first millennium A.D., after the introduction of the bow and arrow, which is indeed the case (see dating results). The average size of Rose Springs Comer-notched arrow points from the nearby Cowboy Cave is 25.3 a4 mm (length) by 11.3 +0.8 mm (width) (Holmer 1980:Table 5). The average size of the 40 flakes from the bag is 31.5 +2.3 mm by 24.1 a0.5 mm, well suited to the production of this arrow point (sufficient length and width to work with). The average length and width of the flake blanks just given ignores the axis of force application for flake detach- ment, merely assigning the longest dimension as length, which at times was par- allel to the axis of flake detachment but at times perpendicular to it (note that the length measurement of Table 1 refers to the axis of force application).</page><page sequence="15">ANALYSIS AND AMS DATING 305 Shape &amp; Section Comments triangular; lenticular L- &amp; X-sec angular; lenticular L-sec, piano-convex X-sec rhomboidal; piano-convex L- &amp; X-sec bladelike laminar flake that is naturally pointed because of a dorsal arris; lenticular L-sec, piano-convex X-sec subrectangular; lenticular L- &amp; X-sec oval; slight concave-convex L-sec, lenticular X-sec rectangular; lenticular L- &amp; X-sec subtriangular; lenticular L-sec, concave- convex X-sec subrectangular; lenticular L- &amp; X-sec subrectangular; piano-convex L- &amp; X-sec subrectangular; lenticular L- &amp; X-sec rectangular; lenticular L- &amp; X-sec triangular; piano-convex L-sec, lenticular X-sec oval; concave-convex L-sec, lenticular X-sec rectangular; lenticular L- &amp; X-sec dark brownish organic residue along square edge of snapped margin; was once moist and contains whitish fibers minimal marginal retouch, along one margin on both faces small patch of whitish fibrous organic residue on dorsal near one margin; two small areas of carbonate accumulation on ventral near platform moderately "fresh" looking some carbonate accumulation on ventral near platform minimal marginal retouch on the ventral surface of one margin just below platform The majority of the flake blanks were derived from biface reduction, mainly from what appears to have been early to middle stages of percussion thinning. There are 20 whole flakes, 9 broken flakes (platform present but a step termina- tion), and 11 flake fragments (no platform). Three of the Dubinky chert flakes exhibit a minor amount of retouch, all minute, noninvasive, and quite limited in extent, as though the flint knapper was just toying with the start of production, sort of a test of blank suitability. Such microflakes can be removed from thin edges by forceful abrasion against a stone, a practice known colloquially among some flint knappers as edge grudging; a broad antler flaker could be used for this purpose as well. Most of the flakes exhibited microflake removals along the margins that could be confused for use-wear except that these are as polished and smoothed as the surfaces of the flakes overall, indicating that the microscarring significantly predates collection of the flake blanks for inclusion in the pouch. A few random nicks occur here and there on some flake margins but nothing that could be con- fidently interpreted as use-wear. Many of the flakes exhibit minute traces of brown- ish organic residue derived from the pouch interior. A few exhibited minute traces</page><page sequence="16">306 PHIL R. GEIB AND MICHAEL R.

ANTLER FLAKING TOOL One of the more interesting finds in the bag is the shaped antler peg shown in Figure 10 along with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of one end. This item measures 42 mm long, 13.5 mm wide, and 8 mm thick. This tool is similar in morphology to flaking tools made of mountain sheep horn that have come from Basketmaker II contexts of the Four-Corners region (Geib 2002). Some of the best examples of these occur together inside a dog-skin bag cached at Sand Dune Cave and dated to the first few centuries A.D. (Geib 2004). The tool from the Great Gallery bag exhibits attrition to the ends from having been used to flake stone, but SEM examination did not reveal any embedded silica frag- ments as was true for most of the similar tools made of mountain sheep horn.</page><page sequence="17">ANALYSIS AND AMS DATING 307 X ............................... . ......... ............. . .............. .......... ................... . . ............. . ...... .. . .... ... .X: . .......

The antler peg was probably put in the Great Gallery pouch because the 40 flakes blanks are worth little in an emergency without the means for transforming them into use- ful tools; the two formed part of toolkit replacement parts that were essential to survival. THE SEEDS A total of 124.6 g of seeds and plant parts were recovered from three different contexts: the bag interior (16.8 g), spillage (105.8 g), and a small amount from the closed section of the bag under the river rock (2.0 g). The total volume was just over 350 ml. All samples were put through a number 35 geologic screen to remove sand. To reduce the effects of contamination (although sand was present in all three contexts), only the sample for the bag interior was analyzed in detail. All material (including the sand) was sorted through a 10-40X binocular micro- scope. The results are given in Table 2. The bulk of the seeds from the cache bag were identified as Iva xanthifolia Nutt (Figure 11), commonly known as marsh elder (following Welsh et al. 1993). Marsh elder is a relative of ragweed and is in the aster family. Marsh elder is a prolific producer of seeds and can reach a height of 2.5 m (Welsh et al. 1993; Whitson et al. 1996:149). The seeds, which consist of small ovate achenes, can be harvested in the late fall. Marsh elder grows in streambeds and floodplains (Whit- son et al. 1996:149). While marsh elder has not been documented in Canyon- lands National Park today, environments such as that of Horseshoe Canyon appear well suited for this species. We made observations of marsh elder in two locations, one along the high- way down McElmo Canyon near Cortez, Colorado, and one in Flagstaff, Arizona. In the first location, several tall plants were observed growing in very disturbed soil along an irrigation ditch. Other species in this location included amaranth, sunflower, and burdock. Burdock, sunflower, amaranth, and nonnative thistles were also abundant in the Flagstaff location. Here, the marsh elder stands were occupying the edge of a water-filled cow tank. Burdock, a prolific invasive species from Europe, was especially abundant in both locations and may have displaced many of the native marsh elder colonies. In the McElmo Canyon location several of the marsh elder plants had been eaten by horses, suggesting that the introduc- tion of large livestock herds to the southwest during the late 1800s may also have reduced local colonies. The modern distribution of marsh elder (from Albee et al. 1988:97) may therefore have been affected by grazing and invasive plants, limit- ing its present-day distribution in Utah to the central valleys of the state. Ethnographic data on the uses of marsh elder are scant and do not mention its consumption as a food. Moerman (1998:279) notes its medicinal use among the Shoshoni and Pauite.

A comparison of prehistoric and modern marsh elder seeds and chaff. by Navajos as a poultice for healing sheep after castration. Chamberlin (1911:361) briefly notes a linguistic equivalency to the Gosiute word for ragweed, which had a medicinal use. Archaeological data are equally scant but do show its use as a food. Unequivocal evidence for the consumption of Iva comes from human feces recovered from the Early Archaic (ca. 7,000 years B.P.) strata at Old Man Cave in southeastern Utah (Geib and Davidson 1994; Hansen 1994). Hansen (1994: Table 8) reported the presence of Iva spp. achenes in 15 of the total 28 human coprolites analyzed. Sump weed (Iva annua L.), a relative of I. xanthifolia, com- monly occurs in the Eastern Agricultural Complex, where it is regarded as a domes- ticate (Jones 1936). Marsh elder can be harvested during late September through November and, as our experiments showed, is best collected when the plant is completely dry. The composition of seeds and chaff (small stem pieces, dried petals, etc.) col- lected in this way, after being lightly winnowed, bore a remarkable resemblance to the archaeological specimens (see Figure 11). We also duly noted that marsh elder has a very unpleasant taste (see also Asch and Asch 1978). Our experience with stands of marsh elder near Flagstaff, Arizona (elevation 6,780 feet), showed that the plant could be harvested as late as mid-November. Of all the seeds widely available to the prehistoric hunter, marsh elder may have been one of the last items, if not the last item, on the menu. Our experiments also showed that a quantity equivalent to the cache (350 ml) could be collected and winnowed in as</page><page sequence="22">312 PHIL R. GEIB AND MICHAEL R. ROBINS little as 10 minutes. Marsh elder, while bitter and unpleasant to the taste, is pos- sibly the last plant of the year from which to attain a quick, easy snack and stash it away for later use. An approximation of the caloric value of marsh elder seeds can be obtained using data provided by Asch and Asch (1978:Table 1). They studied the economic potential of the midwestern species, Iva annua, where it is widely regarded as hav- ing been cultivated in prehistoric times (Jones 1936). According to their data, I. annua kernels, a somewhat larger seed than I. xanthifolia, yields 535 calories per 100 g. Iva kernels are equivalent to sunflower seeds and are very rich in calcium, iron, and B-complex vitamins. An adult can obtain his or her daily caloric needs (2,500) from 467 g ofI. annua kernels. The kernels constitute about 55 percent of the total seed weight. One would therefore have to consume 680 g of unprocessed Iva achenes in order to obtain the 2,500 calorie daily requirement. In order to estimate the caloric value of the seed cache it is first necessary to (1) deduct the approximate weight of chaff from the sample weight and (2) cal- culate the weight loss of the prehistoric sample due to dehydration and insect consumption. Insect consumption was very common throughout the cache spec- imens. The calculation for step 1 averages at 10 percent, and the calculation for step 2 averages at 58 percent (a subsample of prehistoric seeds weighed 0.055 g, and a subsample of 100 similarly sized modem seeds weighed 0.095 g). Our pre- historic sample weighs approximately 112 grams after deducting the chaff and lost almost half of its weight to dehydration and insect consumption. The pre- historic sample therefore should have weighed around 177 g. Fifty-five percent of this weight comprises the kernel weight of the cache, which is 97 g. Using the caloric value of I. anuua as a proxy for the caloric value of I. xanthifolia, (5.35 cal/g) the prehistoric cache had a caloric value approximating 519. The recovered volume of seeds amounted to 350 ml; however, the bag was damaged, and some seeds had obviously fallen out. The bottom part of the bag, which is roughly spherical in shape, has an average diameter of 9.4 cm, giving it a potential maximum volume of 435 cm3, or its equivalent of 435 ml. This maxi- mum potential volume is 20 percent greater than the recovered volume of seeds. Even so, the potential calories that the bag could have provided would not have exceeded 620, which is barely more than one-fifth of a person's daily need, or one large cheeseburger. By itself, then, the cache appears to have been little more than a snack. The food value of the seeds would provide some degree of comfort while traveling but would not have sustained a hunter through an extended period of deprivation. Other than marsh elder, the most common taxon recovered from the bag was sand dropseed (Sporobolus sp.), followed by goosefoot (Chenopdium sp.). Very small quantities of pigweed (Amaranthus sp.) and purslane (Portulaca sp.) were also observed. Since these seeds all occur in such small quantities, they are likely the remains from previous cache uses of this bag. All the seeds identified in the cache</page><page sequence="23">ANALYSIS AND AMS DATING 313 gra 4: x: ...... . a i 'a Ut:~' ' X0::: ::::'iiii\: ::,E: :a:: : :: :e aa ::i: Noftem Uniersiy Ma 75 rn fil FIGURE 12. SEM image of marsh elder seeds from the bag showing ventral, cross-section, and dorsal views (left to right). mature in the fall. It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that the cache was laid out in anticipation of the hunter's needs during the late fall and winter months. In addition to seeds, small quantities of charcoal, pitch, debitage, and insect parts were recovered. The debitage is a clear to red speckled chalcedony, a differ- ent material from the flake blanks that occurred in the one pouch. Of note is the small piece of pinyon pine pitch mixed with finely ground charcoal and includ- ing several hair fragments and follicles. No doubt this blob broke free from pitch smear on the corner of the leg-section pouch. The combination of pitch and finely ground charcoal was commonly used to secure arrowheads and knife blades into wooden foreshafts and handles. DATING THE BAG For the purposes of radiocarbon dating, we removed three tiny samples from dif- ferent components of the cache: (1) leather from the outer bag, (2) a piece of the bast string tie of the interior pouch that held the flakes (annual plant fibers), and (3) some of the seeds that filled the bottom portion of the bag (annual plant remains). Barring an heirloom or artifact recycling, all three samples should be</page><page sequence="24">314 PHIL R. GEIB AND MICHAEL R. ROBINS contemporaneous, and indeed this turned out to be the case. The three samples were submitted to the NSF-Arizona AMS Facility in Tucson, Arizona, which returned the assays listed in Table 3. In conventional radiocarbon years the dates are no more than 60 years apart, with almost complete overlap of the calibrated two- sigma date ranges. The average of these three statistically identical dates is 1,155 a22 years B.P., which has a calibrated two-sigma spread of A.D. 770-970. DISCUSSION We believe that the Great Galley bag is a good example of what Binford (1979) calls insurance gear, a term and concept that he learned from the logistically orga- nized Nunamiut caribou hunters of the Arctic. The Nunamiut distribute materials that might generally be needed at some unspecified future time throughout their territory and do so during the conduct of regular activities, thereby imposing no extra costs. By doing this, the Nunamiut improve the quality of their environ- ment: "the Eskimo gain utility in both time and space for their resources, at very little direct cost in mobility or transport" (Binford 1979:258). It is also true that the caching of insurance gear gives the Nunamiut an added margin of security by reducing the risks of being caught short. In the words of Jessie Ahgook, "Every dead Eskimo can remember something that he not pick up (and cache) when it was around" (quoted in Binford 1979:258). We conjecture that the bag was cached as insurance gear within what the owner would have considered part of the customary territory, the familiar region that was commonly traversed on an annual basis to extract subsistence resources and for other purposes. It might have been near the edge of this territory, but it seems unlikely that a cache like this would be placed outside this region in what would have been the seldom-visited home range of some other group. The motive for making a cache like this would be the anticipatory need, something that occurs at a distance from home but in an area frequently visited. As such, the raw material that accounts for nearly all of the flaked-stone artifacts in the bag pro- vides a means for making certain inferences about movement on the landscape. Dubinky chert is not a material of exceptional quality such that flint knappers would make special trips to obtain it. Moreover, the general region is not impov- erished when it comes to high-quality siliceous stone: there are vast exposures of chert beds in the Chinle Formation along the Orange Cliffs scarp, from the Cutler Formation (Cedar Mesa Sandstone), and from the Summerville Formation, just to name the most prominent (e.g., Geib et al. 1986:29-32; Tipps and Hewitt 1989:81-87). Also, portions of the landscape that surround Horseshoe Canyon are mantled by calcified Quaternary gravels containing lag deposit chert nodules of moderate quality. The implication is that the flakes of Dubinky chert were opportunistically surface scavenged while the individual was on another mission that placed him in the vicinity of this source. Had the individual simply needed</page><page sequence="25">ANALYSIS AND AMS DATING 313 TABLE 3.

ROBINS some flakable stone for artifact production, there were plenty of higher-quality sources, including extensive scatters of flakes, much closer to Horseshoe Canyon. Given the location of the cache relative to the Dubinky source, the individual traveled to the southwest crossing the Green River and then ascended Horseshoe Canyon while heading for home. At the time period of the cache (A.D. 770-970), formative populations whose home range lay west of the Colorado River and the Green River would have been part of the Fremont Complex (Madsen and Simms 1998), groups surviving by a mixed farming and foraging strategy. Bull Creek (Jennings and Sammons-Lohse 1981) next to Hanksville on the Fremont River provides a sam- ple of excavated Fremont habitations that are the same age as the Great Gallery bag; sites similar to those excavated along Bull Creek are widely scattered in the area, focused on sources of permanent water. The owner of the bag may well have originated from one such residential site, traveling far to the northeast on a hunt- ing expedition. Part of the reason for making this inference is the idea that the bag was an insurance cache, with the implication that the individual who hid the bag was on a logistic foray from some semipermanent residence rather than being a simple forager with a high degree of residential mobility that moved through the region on a regular basis. It is conceivable that foragers may have relied on insurance caches as well, in which case the bag might represent some of the diversity in settlement and subsistence strategies that Madsen and Simms (1998) highlight. Even if this is so, the bag still represents a component of an adaptive strategy of populations residing west of the Colorado River. CONCLUSIONS Finds such as the Great Gallery bag are remarkable because they are a literal time capsule, a rare glimpse into the personal effects of an individual from the distant past: the objects that sustained them, amused them, and cured them and the val- ued objects that they made or found. Such finds allow exploration of prehistory in a personal way, a touching of part of an individual's life story. Yet such finds can also inform on a much broader level, for the concerns of an individual reflected in the cached personal effects also reflect the concerns of the culture that the per- son was raised within and the behavioral strategies that helped to ensure survival. Because each cache pertains to only a segment of past reality, informing at this more general level requires compiling a composite image from the details and insights gleaned from numerous contemporaneous caches. Such a compilation must await future studies of bags such as that reported here. Our interpretation is that the Great Galley bag was the possession of a flint knapper and hunter, one who had ventured across the Green River to the Dubinky chert source. He was probably on a late fall hunt, the season when marsh elder is in harvest, and while there he scavenged surface flakes well suited to arrow point</page><page sequence="27">ANALYSIS AND AMS DATING 317 production. He collected more than needed for the short term, allowing 40 flake blanks to be cached as insurance gear. These he placed in a red-stained pouch along with an antler pressure flaker and an unfinished arrow point. Home was to the southwest, perhaps along the Fremont River, and the trip back brought him up Horseshoe Canyon, a natural travel corridor when heading southwestward out of the deeply entrenched Green River gorge. This led directly past the Great Gallery, a sacred place well known to the hunters of his group and thus an excel- lent location for a cache, one easily remembered and described to kin. His travel bag for food was now almost empty but contained enough seeds to aid someone in dire need. The seeds were sequestered in the bottom by binding the middle of the bag with a handy leather strap. The flake-filled pouch with antler flaker was added to the upper part of the bag along with a worn-out pouch that would make a handy palm pad when pressure flaking and a small stone useful for edge abra- sion and percussion flaking. In the pursuit of game, hunters must commonly travel great distances, so mobility is simply part and parcel of protein acquisition. The caching of tools and emergency rations makes good sense in terms of costs and benefits, espe- cially in a landscape where dry hiding places abound and are easily relocated and where geologic features constrain the movements of people. A cache such as the Great Galley bag could save precious hours during a hunt by eliminating the need to search for raw material after breaking the last point. The handful of seeds would have provided a hunter with only about 620 calories, by itself little more than a light snack, yet this amount could stave off hunger or even be the differ- ence between life and death in the direst of circumstances. These benefits far out- weigh the cost of leaving behind the bag, pouches, and other contents, even if, as happened in this case, the bag was never recovered. The few forgotten caches of prehistory likely represent just a fraction of the hundreds or thousands that were retrieved and that doubtless provided the margin of survival in several cases and a huge relief in others. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS First, we would like to recognize the visitors, Sam and Ashley Grimes, who dis- covered the bag and then responsibly notified the Park Service without removing the find. Because of their selflessness the public has gained; everyone can enjoy both the objects and the insights to the past that they provide. Second, we thank Chris Goetze, Cultural Resource Program Manager, Southeast Utah Group, National Park Service, for bringing the bag to our attention and facilitating the artifact loan so that we could conduct this analysis. Tim Jull and the NSF-Arizona AMS Facility generously provided the AMS dates for our three samples. Ian Thompson helped with the identification of the hide and provided other useful information about tanning and leather preparation. Randy Haas confirmed the bast identification</page><page sequence="28">318 PHIL R. GEIB AND MICHAEL R. ROBINS for the one minute cordage sample that we sent him. Marilee Sellers of Northern Arizona University was of great assistance as usual with the scanning electron microscope. It was a pleasure to visit the Great Gallery in the winter of 2006 to examine the find location accompanied by Chuck LaRue, a veritable fount of knowledge about local wildlife. We also extend a note of thanks to Phyllis Hogan and Karen Adams who provided useful information about marsh elder.
