<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC BRONZE STATUETTES OF ARCHAIC IDALION, CYPRUS (PLATESI 5--I8) INTRODUCTION The anthropomorphic bronze statuettes of Archaic Cyprus remain less well known than the contemporary limestone and terracotta sculptures of the island.' Of these bronzes, examples unearthed in I868 at the temple of Apollo in Idalion by R. H. Lang, the then British consul to Cyprus, comprise the largest group known from a single site.2 They are now in the British Museum and have never been discussed fully, although Masson illustrated some of them in 1968, a hundred years after Lang's excavations, making important observations.3 At the temple Lang also found bronze statuettes from later periods,4 but because of their number the CA (Cypro-Archaic) examples comprise the most significant type within this body of material. This article discusses the anthropomorphic CA bronze statuettes from Idalion, setting them within the context of other contemporary bronze figurines from Cyprus.5 It 'I use the terms 'Cypro-Archaic', abbreviated as CA, and 'Archaic' interchangeably to denote the periods from c.750 to 600 oo (CA I) and from c.6oo to 475 BC (CA II).

Colonna-Ceccaldi, Monuments antiques de Chypre (Paris, 1882), pl. I, provides a more detailed plan. On the location of the temple that Lang excavated and the difficulty of identifying it, see 0.

I have not been able to consult the unpublished dissertation of R. Senff on the temple of Apollo at Idalion, cited in the bibliography of A. Hermary, Musie du Louvre, Catalogue des antiquitis de Chypre: Sculptures (Paris, 1989). 3 Masson 386-402. 4 Ibid. 393-6, items a, b, d, h; figs. 15-17, 28. See also A.

Ath. 13 (i980), 131; Decaudin 184. I exclude from consideration the Cypriot bronze figurines that closely copy standard represen- tations of Egyptian deities, since none has an archaeologi- cal context that allows even a broad dating. Such figurines, when found in the Levant, generally belong to the Persian period or later (e.g. Y. Aharoni, Beer-Sheba i (Tel Aviv, 1973), 16; 54; J. B. Pritchard, Gibeon (Princeton, 1962), 122;</page><page sequence="2">244 A. T. REYES examines aspects of their chronology, style, and usage, and considers them within a broad archaeological and historical framework. Recent studies of Levantine bronze statuettes6 make it possible to draw comparisons with areas outside the island, and since the chronological and stylistic development of CA limestone and terracotta sculptures is currently under review,7 it seems appropriate to consider how, if at all, these bronze figurines contribute to an understanding of these related problems. In discussing the material, I have used the term 'Cypriot' to denote any bronze statuette found on the island, whether through excavation or antiquarian research. In the latter case, the reported provenances may often prove unreliable and should be treated with caution. The problem of distinguishing local products from imported ones is considered further below. THE STATUETTES FROM IDALION AND OTHER CYPRIOT SITES Lang reported that the bronze statuettes from the temple of Apollo were found in what he supposed was an inner courtyard, just beyond the entrance of the temple building: The imposing array of statuary which met the eye of the visitor as he entered the temple in the days of its glory may be conceived, when I say that the headless statues which strewed the ground must have represented I,ooo pieces of sculpture, of which nearly ioo were of colossal or heroic size.8 He went on to mention 'tiny feet in bronze, still adhering to some of the marble slabs', among the larger stone and terracotta pieces. The catalogue that follows separates the CA bronze statuettes into groups, largely on the basis of their different stances. Examples from Idalion appear first, followed by those from other sites, listed alphabetically. Museum accession numbers, extant heights (excluding tenons), and brief descriptions are given, and a select bibliography appears at the end of an entry. An asterisk before a catalogue entry indicates an item I have not examined and handled directly. When no plate number is given, the statuette is not illustrated. I have provided photographs of the bronzes from Idalion and some lesser- known examples from elsewhere, but have otherwise simply cited, in the bibliography, illustrations in readily accessible books and journals. The plates reproduce the statuettes at approximately life-size. The statuettes, unless otherwise stated, represent male figures, wearing Egyptian-style kilts and conical helmets, some of which, at least, imitate the Egyptian white crown.9 fig. 94; J. H. Iliffe, QDAP 5 (1936), 6I-8); the same may hold true for Cyprus. I know of the following examples in the Cyprus Museum, Nicosia: Nefertem (I977.viii-23.13; K. Nicolaou, AR (198o-I), 57-8, fig. 6, with an LC date, but possibly Iron Age); Imhotep (D.326o; GCM 145, no. 6); Anubis (1959.xii-22.I); Osiris (I935.ix-II"; 1947.x-i6.7; D.3217; D.3258; D.3259; cf. GCM 145, no. 5). Note also L.

The plan in Colonna-Ceccaldi (n. 2) marks the position of one bronze statuette in front of a large stone basin, in a courtyard Nw of the precinct.

Standing; arms along the sides; left leg advanced The stance is well attested among terracotta votives from the Ayia Irini sanctuary.14 Within this context, the position probably identifies a figure not as a god, but as a mortal worshipper or attendant. Perforations in the fists of 5 and 9 suggest they carried attributes or weapons,'5 but these are not sufficient to identify divine representations. This type of statuette is well known in the Late Bronze Age Levant, but there are no bronze examples from Cyprus that certainly date to this time.'6 Idalion I. (PLATE 15 a).

The use of incision and the manner of dress, in particular the Egyptian-style collar (cf. the collar of 18, xg, and 28), are appro- priate to Cypriot bronze figurines. The way in which the hair falls onto the middle of the back, however, seems unparalleled in archaic Cypriot sculpture. Unlike the others, the following two are more purely Greek in style and resemble kouroi. Neither has an archaeological context, but their appearance, in particular their short hair, indicates a date in the late sixth or early fifth century. Cf. the modelling of xII with G. M. A.

Standing; one fist on the chest; one arm falling vertically; left leg advanced Of 14 bronzes listed, 7 hold their left fists to their chests, 7 the right; the distinction has no apparent significance. There are no certain examples from Cyprus dating to the Late Bronze Age, and the pose does not seem to be attested at this time among Levantine bronze statuettes. It may well be that the gesture, when used by Cypriot bronze figurines, is indicative of an Iron Age date.2' Myres and Gjerstad noted that, among CA terracotta and stone sculptures, the gesture is very common.22 Idalion 14.

But this is the only example of a figure holding this stance listed in Negbi, and it seems more appropriate to associate it with the other examples from the Iron Age. The round head would not be out of place in the CA period, although the remaining features of the figurine are too summarily executed to allow for close dating. Cyprus Museum, Nicosia B.2614, an unpublished torso fragment, is assigned by the Museum inventory to LBA, but it may belong to IA as well. See also G.

Standing; right arm raised, bent at the elbow, the hand with palm shown open; left leg advanced The gesture sends and acknowledges greetings or blessings, and, in showing the right hand unarmed, emphasizes peaceful intentions.25 The left hand is usually by the side, but may extend forward or be placed on the chest. The stance recalls Cypriot terracotta and stone figures bearing gifts, the right hand raised in greeting, the left with an offering held to the chest.26 There are no known Cypriot examples in bronze dating to the Late Bronze Age, although the gesture is well known among the bronze statuettes of the second- millennium Levant.27 There seem to be no Levantine examples, however, that are shown standing and holding this gesture. As with Group B, it may well be that, among Cypriot bronze statuettes, this stance is indicative of an Iron Age date. The identity of these figurines remains uncertain, but the horned helmet of 28 is possibly an indication of divinity.28 Idalion 28. (PLATE 17 d). British Museum, London; 1872.8-16.96. H. 0.144.

Seated Cypriot bronze seated figures are well known from the Late Bronze Age.39 Heads are in the round, but bodies are essentially flat pieces bent at the hips and again at the knees. Some were simply set on model chairs of bronze or another material; others were secured with tenons. There are no local examples that certainly date to the CA period, and the possibility that 38 is a Bronze Age survivor should be considered.40 It is comparable to a twelfth-century seated bronze figurine from Enkomi.41 But the number of Levantine seated figures with Iron Age contexts is not insignificant and includes figurines from Hama (tenth- to ninth-century context),42 Findik (eighth century),"43 and Al Mina (seventh to early sixth century).44 A seated figure from Samos probably dates to the seventh or early sixth century.45 For the skull-cap and the shape of the head of 38, compare a seventh- or sixth-century Phoenician bronze from Cadiz.46 34"J.

At Kourion, terracotta figur- ines with low turbans fall largely within the 6th cent.53 The long, plain, tight-fitting robe is comparable in style to the dresses of two female smiting figures, one from Tell Dan, the other of unknown provenance.

A limestone head from a CA II tomb in Salamis is very close,60 as is the head of a late Archaic limestone statue excavated from the Persian siege ramp at Paphos.6' DIscussIoN Chronology The Archaic style of the bronze figurines from Idalion is largely unmistakeable. The Egyptianizing headdresses, jewellery, and clothing are typical of seventh- and sixth- century Cypriot sculpture, reflecting in part a cultural background held in common with the Phoenician coast.62 Similar Egyptianizing bronze figurines are known from the Levant during the mature Iron Age (ninth to seventh centuries)."6 None of the few archaeological contexts that are available for the Cypriot bronze statuettes from other sites contradicts this dating. These contexts are summarized in TABLE I, which suggests that, in Cyprus, the series of Egyptianizing bronze figurines had already started by the beginning of the sixth century. Further chronological precision is at present unattainable. The only reasonably secure fixed points for the dating of Cypriot sculpture derive from Samos, where Cypriot statuary with Egyptianizing clothing had appeared before the middle of the sixth century.64 Thus the Samian evidence and the evidence derived from the archaeolo- gical contexts of the bronze statuettes may be taken as mutually supportive.65 Few other chronological patterns are evident. The possibility exists that the stances of TABLE I Summary of Archaeological Contexts Catalogue number Site Context 3 Ayia Irini 700-650 Bc 4 Ayia Irini 650o-6oo00 B 5 Kition CA I 6 Larnaca-Ayios Georghios CA I-CC I 30 Ayia Irini 65o-600 BC 31 Kition CA I 37 Samos c.650 BC 59 Cf.

For the most recent fixed point for dating Cypriot sculptural styles, note H. Ky- rieleis, 'New Cypriot finds from the Heraion of Samos', in V. Tatton-Brown (ed.), Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean in the Iron Age (London, 1989), 52-67. 65 Markoe (n. 7), 112, suggests that the bulk of Egyptianizing limestone male statuary falls within the period of the Cypro-Greek sculptural style (520-480). But for the bronze statuary, at least, this seems untrue. Cf. also C. C. Vermeule, AJA 78 (0974), 287-90; Gaber-Saletan (n. 7), 89-92.</page><page sequence="13">THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC STATUETTES OF ARCHAIC IDALION 255 figurines in Groups B and C are distinctive of the Cypriot Iron Age. Late Bronze Age examples of standing bronze figurines holding these particular poses are unknown in Cyprus and the Levant (see above). By the last quarter of the sixth century the bronze statuettes, along with the rest of Cypriot sculpture, become influenced by East Greek styles and exhibit softly modelled features with smiling expressions (e.g. 7-8, 21, 45).66 By the late Archaic and Classical periods, they appear, for the most part, purely hellenized (e.g. 1]x-x_ ).67 It is impossible to establish a continuity between the CA bronze statuary and the Cypriot Late Bronze Age tradition of Egyptianizing figurines.68 No anthropomorphic bronze figurines are known from Cyprus in the CG period. On present evidence, then, it seems reasonable to posit that this change in dedicatory patterns during the CA period reflects a true shift in local votice practice. But some caution is necessary, since current understanding of Cypriot society prior to the Archaic period derives largely from tomb groups rather than sanctuaries. Styles At the outset it may be noted that, with the exception of 43, whose dating is uncertain, all the anthropomorphic CA bronze figures represent males. As in the Levant, female bronze votives were probably dedicated in local Cypriot sanctuaries; but these are not as yet unequivocally attested in the archaeological record.69 As with the CA terracottas, far fewer female bronze figurines may have been dedicated.70 On the Phoenician coast, female bronze statuettes are equally rare.71 The identification of different regional styles is made difficult by the small number of Cypriot bronze figurines that survive, and by the possibility that a statuette from a particular sanctuary was imported rather than locally manufactured. For the same reason, comment on relationships between different parts of Cyprus is impossible on the basis of this material. Small as they are, some figurines may have been carried into the island from the Levant, where an Egyptianizing taste was equally prevalent; it is notorious that, in the absence of comparable well-dated material from the principal centres of mainland Phoenicia, distinguishing local from imported material is hazardous at best. TABLE 2 presents a summary of the total number of bronzes from the different areas of Cyprus. Only Idalion provides a body of material large enough for an attempt to be made at defining a local style.72 But it is only an assumption that the majority of the thirteen Idalion statuettes were manufactured there.73 6" See e.g. C.

Above all, however, they show a liking for incised detail. Eight statuettes (15-20, 28, and 38) are particularly close in this regard; and I6-I8, which are very similar in their expressions and in the markings on their joints and clothing, may well have been manufactured by the same workshop. This unity of style between eight out of thirteen statuettes from Idalion supports the hypothesis that these bronzes were manufactured in one area. If that is correct, then it is reasonable to suppose that they were produced in Idalion, close as it is to the copper mining sites in the foothills of the Troodos mountains.74 Of unprovenanced examples, io and 27 have many of their details incised, but do not otherwise resemble the Idalion bronze figurines. In contrast, however, statuettes 14 and 35, both from Idalion, have facial features and clothing that resemble each other, perhaps indicating a common origin, but do not use incised detail. Usage The statuettes with known archaeological contexts come, in the main, from sanctuaries and were used as dedications. It cannot be claimed with certainty that these statuettes represent divinities rather than worshippers. Statuette 6 from Larnaca-Ayios Georghios is unusual in having a tomb context. The ring-attachments at its back, and also behind 13, suggest that some anthropomorphic bronze statuettes were also used as pendants. 74 On Idalion and its copper-mining industry see F. L. Koucky and A. Steinberg, 'Ancient mining and mineral dressing on Cyprus', in Stager and Walker (n. 73), 275; cf. J. Waldbaum, 'Metalwork from Idalion, 1971-1980', 328 in the same vol. ('. . . there is little or no evidence for ongoing manufacture of significant classes of metalwork'). For a copper-working site near Idalion, probably in operation by the late CA II period, see W. Fasnacht et al., RDAC 1989, 59-76.</page><page sequence="15">THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC STATUETTES OF ARCHAIC IDALION 257 The quantity and quality of terracotta sculptures in CA sanctuaries have tended to overshadow the importance of the votive bronze figurines, which are less in evidence archaeologically. But the practice of dedicating anthropomorphic metal figurines may have been as common in Archaic Cyprus as it was during the Late Bronze Age.75 CONCLUSIONS In contrast to other sanctuaries where the metal votive statuettes reflect a more international character (e.g. the temple of Hera on Samos), the bronze figurines of the temple of Apollo at Idalion are specifically Cypriot. The sanctuary seems to have catered, in the main, to local worshippers. The small scale and often summary execution of the bronze figurines indicate that a wide cross-section of the population could probably have afforded these objects.76 The absence of bronze anthropomorphic figurines in the CG period, and their subsequent appearance in CA sanctuaries, may reflect a change in Cypriot votive practices. If so, the reasons behind this shift cannot be precisely determined. The practice of dedicating metal statuary is not, in general, Assyrian, nor are the Cypriot bronze figurines comparable to Mesopotamian ones, although some show Assyrianizing traits.77 But on the traditional historical assumption of an Egyptian domination of Cyprus under the Pharoah Amasis around the middle of the sixth century, it might be argued that Cypriots learned to dedicate anthropomorphic bronze statuary from Egypt, where the practice had been widespread since 750 BC.78 But since it seems likely that metal anthropomorphic statuettes had already appeared in Cypriot temples by the beginning of the sixth century, it is difficult to reconcile Cypriot practice with conquest by Amasis. Nevertheless, an Egyptian domination - if that is the correct term - cannot be excluded as a contributory factor; it need not have been the decisive one. The CA period, however, saw increased participation between Cyprus and the Levant within an economic system fostered by the different Near Eastern empires. Close interaction resulted in a general increase in metalwork on the island.79 What develop- ments in metal statuary took place in the Levant during the first half of the first millennium still remains very much a mystery.8o But on the basis of the statuettes from Cyprus, it seems safe to conclude that the greater demand for metalwork at this time encouraged a taste for dedicating bronze anthropomorphic figurines in the local sanctu- aries of the island. St Hugh's College, Oxford A. T. REYES 75 I estimate that the total number of anthropomorphic bronze statuettes currently known from LBA Cyprus is roughly the same as the number of CA statuettes cata- logued above. 76 Markoe (n. 7), I19-20, however, suggests that the large-scale Egyptianizing limestone sculptures of the Late Archaic period were dedicated principally by Phoenician immigrants who constituted a foreign elite within the island. 77 For examples of typical Mesopotamian bronze figur- ines see E.
