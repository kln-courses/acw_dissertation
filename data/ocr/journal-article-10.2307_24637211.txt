Hatch1 Toe-clipping is a commonly used method to mark reptiles and amphibians, collect genetic information, and collect samples to identify disease. Institutional animal care and use committees impose restrictions on such practices in an effort to mitigate pain inflicted on research animals. However, what is considered "painful" is often based on anthropomorphic intuition rather than scientific evidence. While there is no way to quantify pain, plasma corticosterone levels can provide a measure of the stress caused by procedures. Such data can provide animal care and use committees with the quantitative data they need to make appropriate decisions regarding procedures. We measured and compared plasma corticosterone levels in control, handled, and toe-clipped Cane Toads (Rhinella marina) to determine the extent to which toe-dipping induces stress. While both handling and toe-dipping did significantly increase corticosterone levels when compared with toads that had not been handled, we found no difference in corticosterone levels between Cane Toads that were handled only and Cane Toads that had been handled and had their toes clipped. We therefore conclude that toe-clipping does not cause a greater stress response than does handling. MARK and recapture techniques are among the laboratory situation can be used to assess stress levels most practical methods available to researchers (Langkilde and Shine, 2006; Archard and Goldsmith, investigating the population dynamics, organism 2010).

In this study we use corticosterone to assess the effect of toe-clipping in an anuran species, the Cane Toad (Rhinella marina, formerly Bufo marinus). Thus we sought to deter mine the stress caused by toe-clipping in a third major taxon of herptile and demonstrate or negate the broad applicabil ity of the findings of the two previous studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS We chose the Cane Toad, Rhinella marina, a toad native to South and Central America (Slade and Moritz, 1998), because it is a robust animal from which blood can easily be sampled. Toads were purchased from Ward's Natural Science (Stamford, CT). The subjects were housed in 25 cm by 50 cm plastic cages and provided with a water dish and section of PVC piping for shelter.

It takes time for corticosterone levels to peak in the blood (Langkilde and Shine, 2006). Since blood cannot be withdrawn multiple times in short succession from the same toad, 20 toads were used to determine how long it takes to reach peak blood-corticosterone levels after admin istering stress. We stressed the toads by placing each toad individually in a five-gallon bucket with a lid and then gently tipping the bucket from end to end for 60 s. We drew blood at randomly assigned periods times after the stress stimulus was administered. Most animals were used only once.

Cane Toad corticosterone levels after application of stress. Each individual is assigned a unique symbol to indicate those that were used multiple times. The data suggest that corticosterone reaches maximum levels approximately between 300 and 500 minutes after application of stress with a visually estimated peak at 350 minutes. peak. Since we had to choose a uniform time at which to take blood samples, we visually determined that 350 minutes was a reasonable estimate of the time to peak corticosterone levels (Fig. 1). While the peak is broad, it is unlikely that corticosterone levels continue to increase much beyond this time point as this peak agrees with the peak found by others (Narayan et al., 2011a). Previous studies show that MS-222 (Tricaine methanesul fonate) can have an effect on Cortisol (Thomas and Robertson, 1991; King et al., 2005; Zahl et al., 2010) and corticosterone (Archard and Goldsmith, 2010) levels. We tested the effect of MS-222 anesthetic on corticosterone levels in Cane Toads by drawing blood from six toads that had been anesthetized as well as from four toads that had not. In the former, blood was drawn immediately following anesthetization. Corticosterone levels between anesthetized and non-anesthetized were compared using a t-test assum ing unequal variances. We then addressed stress caused by handling and toe clipping Cane Toads as compared to handling without toe clipping. Eighteen toads were placed into six groups of three in order to block for the effect of time and handler. Two different handlers conducted the treatment, each with three groups. Within each group there was a control individual, an individual to be handled only, and an individual to be toe-clipped. Each group was run as a separate and indepen dent trial. The control was removed from its housing and immediately anesthetized. Once the toad was anesthetized, 1 ml of blood was taken and. The toe-clipped toad was removed from its housing and digits 300, 2400, and 4 (Martof, 1953) were removed according to the protocol set forth by United States Geologic Survey (Green, 2001). Since under field conditions animals are not typically anesthe tized when their toes are clipped, we did not anesthetize our Cane Toads before clipping their toes. The toe-clipped toad was then returned to its cage and placed back on the shelving units for 5 hours and 50 minutes (350 min, Fig. 1). After 5 hours and 50 minutes the toad was removed and anesthetized, then 1 ml of blood was removed and stored. The handled-only toad was removed from its housing and handled in the same manner for the same duration of time as the toe-clipped toad, including touching its correspond ing toes with scissors, but no digits were removed. The handled only toad was replaced in its housing and left alone for 5 hours and 50 minutes. After that time period it was anesthetized and 1 ml of blood was removed and stored. All treatments for each trial were timed in such a manner that blood samples were taken in succession, with all three samples being taken within 15 minutes of one another. All blood samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm 12,700 x g for 30 minutes. The pellet was discarded and the plasma supernatant was retained and stored in a freezer at -18°C. All blood samples were drawn via cardiac puncture using an 18-gauge needle and 10 ml syringe (Wright and Whi taker, 2001). Care was taken to guard against infection by spraying the chest with Bactine before and after puncture. The anesthetic used was MS-222 at a concentration of 10 g/1. A volume of 1 liter was used to anesthetize each toad for a time period of 7-14 minutes, depending on the toad's size. Blood samples were stored in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes, as were centrifuged plasma samples. All plasma samples were assayed for corticosterone concentration using the OCTEIA Corticosterone HS Kit (Immunodiagnostic Systems, Ltd., UK). Samples taken to determine peak levels were measured throughout several separate assays, while the 18 samples taken in the experimental phase were all assayed simultaneously. Concentrations were compared using a two way ANOVA with treatment and handler as factors. We used a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test ([' &lt; 0.05). RESULTS Time to peak corticosterone levels.—While a considerable amount of variation in corticosterone levels after the administration of a stressor produced a broad peak, in order to choose a single constant time we visually estimated peak corticosterone levels to be reached after approximately 350 minutes (Fig. 1). Effects of anesthesia.—We did not find a significant increase (t8 = 2.13, P &lt; 0.07) in corticosterone levels among toads that had been anesthetized before blood samples were taken (16.8± 1.9 ng/ml SE) as compared to toads that had not been anesthetized before samples were taken (12.6±1.1 ng/ml SE). The large variance and small sample size results in a low power to detect a difference of this magnitude (ß = 0.13) at P = 0.05. Effect of toe-clipping and handling on corticosterone levels.— Control toads showed significantly lower plasma corticoste rone levels than either toe-clipped or handled only toads. (^2,18 = 4.975, P = 0.019). Toe-clipped toads did not differ significantly in plasma corticosterone levels from handled only toads (Fig. 2). The effect of handler was not significant (Fs, 12 = 1-65, P ~ 0.22) and was excluded from the model. This analysis had a power of 0.8 to detect differences in corticosterone levels of 4 ng/ml or more. DISCUSSION It has been well established in the literature that the capture and handling of amphibians and reptiles, by itself, activates a stress response (Coddington and Cree, 1995; Homan et al., 2003; Ricciardella et al., 2010; Woodley and Lacy, 2010; Narayan et al., 2011b). Toe-clipping has been shown now in three major taxa to be no more stressful than handling. Kinkead et al. (2006) saw no significant differences in stress hormone responses in Dusky (Desmognathus fuscus) and Seal (.Desmognathus monticola) salamanders that were handled and</page><page sequence="3">Fisher et al.—Stress induced by toe-clipping 541 , 1 1 Control Handled Only Toe-clipping Treatment 55 50 • o&gt; 45 • 40 • 8 3S " c o 2 30 ■ * 25 - o o 20* 1 1 1 Control Handled Only Toe-clipping Treatment Fig. 2.

Langkilde and Shine (2006) found toe-clipping did not cause significantly higher corticosterone levels in the scincid lizard, Eulamprus heatwolei. This study's findings suggest this trend can be extended to anurans. The measure of blood corticosterone level is commonly used as an indicator of stress in amphibians and reptiles, and we found no significant differences between corticosterone levels in blood plasma of handled toads and those whose toes were clipped. It is important to note that a similar study conducted by Narayan et al. (2011a) found elevated corticosterone metabolite levels in urine in response to toe-clipping in Rhinella marina. Traditionally, studies of corticosterone have been conducted using plasma and it is possible that there are differences in sensitivity between the two assays. This may be attributed in part to the need for anesthetization of Cane Toads in order to take blood samples for analysis while no anesthesia is required to collect urine (Narayan et al., 2011a). While we found no evidence of an effect of anesthesia on corticosterone levels in plasma, the low power of the statistical test suggests that this failure to detect an effect of anesthesia may be due to a type II error. While both clipped and undipped toads were subjected to anesthesia before blood was collected, it is possible that increases in corticosterone levels due to anesthesia or increased variabil ity in corticosterone levels due to anesthesia make plasma corticosterone tests less sensitive than urine-based cortico sterone tests. The relative effectiveness and sensitivities of these techniques warrants further scrutiny. The difference in the sources of the Cane Toads for the two studies may also explain the different results. Narayan et al. (2011a) conducted their study using wild toads. They collected urine at the site of capture, while we purchased our toads from a biological supply company and maintained them in a lab. Lab specimens may be acclimatized to captivity and handling and this may account for a more muted response. A comparison between corticosterone levels induced in lab reared and wild caught specimens by toe-clipping may provide further insight into this problem. There are few marking techniques that do not require the handling of the animal. Toe-clipping as a technique is an extremely efficient and practical tool for field ecologists (Funk et al., 2005). Much of what is known of amphibian population dynamics has been discovered from mark recapture studies using this method (Reaser, 2000; Funk et al., 2005; Härtel and Nemes, 2006; Gillespie, 2011). Toe clipping is a low cost technique, which is important since many field studies have small budgets. With amphibians being some of the most beleaguered of species (Laurance et al., 1996; Alford and Richards, 1999; Woodhams and Alford, 2005; Woodhams et al., 2008), maximizing the benefits of field studies while stretching resources is essential. While stress is an important consideration, any marking technique that involves handling will impose stress on the animal. Scientifically and ethically it is more important to know whether marking techniques violate the assumptions of mark-recapture models, producing spurious results. While some studies have shown little to no effect of toe-clipping on recovery rates of amphibians (e.g., Reaser and Dexter, 1996; Ott and Scott, 1999), the statistical power of these studies has often been weak (Parris and McCarthy, 2001; McCarthy and Parris, 2004). Others have shown negative effects on recovery rates as a result of toe-clipping (Davis and Ovaska, 2001; McCarthy and Parris, 2004; McCarthy et al., 2009), while a single controlled study found no effect of toe-clipping on survival of salamanders (Ott and Scott, 1999). It may be well advised to shift the focal point of the debate surrounding toe clipping from a discussion on immediate stress responses to an inquiry on the long term effects of any marking study with regards to both return rates and long term stress impacts.
