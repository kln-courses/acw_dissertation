<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORTS FOR 1971-72 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS ON THE NORTHERN SHORE OF THE BLACK SEA IN THE TERRITORY OF THE SOVIET UNION, 1965-70 The five years from 1965-70 were a time of intensive archaeological investigations all along the northern shore of the Black Sea. During this period Soviet classical archaeology also sustained a heavy loss: 1966 saw the death of one of its outstanding archaeologists, Viktor Frantsevich Gaidukevich, who had been a tireless researcher into the towns of the Bosporan kingdom. With his death the long years of fruitful work on a study of Myrmecium were temporarily halted, but at all other points operations continued to enjoy success, and here and there even spread further afield. In 1965 the periodical Archaeological Discoveries started to appear, published annually by the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. It was thus made possible for the scientific world to learn the preliminary results of the previous year's discoveries not later than 5-6 months after the conclusion of the summer archaeological campaign. At the same time there also appeared periodicals issued in the republics-in particular the Sbornik of The Editor wishes to thank Miss Lee Dowding for the transla- tion of the Russian text, and Mr David Blackman for help with specific problems. A previous survey which included the Russian sites was published in Archaeological Reports 1962-63, 34-51, 'Greek Archaeology on the Shores of the Black Sea', byJohn Boardman. the Institute of Archaeology of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, which also carried the results of work in the Crimea and in the southern Ukraine. Reference is made in these periodicals to operations in areas where canals and artificial lakes are to be built; an extensive and thorough examination is now being made of the whole area to be flooded. As before, the results of operations have been published in regular issues of Soviet Archaeology, Short Reports of the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, and Archaeology (the organ of the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR). During the period two corpora were published of inscriptions from the North Pontic Coast: the Corpus Inscriptionum Regni Bosporani (CIRB, Moscow-Leningrad, 1969); and Inscriptiones Olbiae (Leningrad, 1968). Of particular importance and significance is the systematic study of all the existing archaeological material in an exemplary publication under the general title Archaeology of the USSR, a Summary of Archaeological Sources. Among the recent summaries, published 1969-70, one might mention the issues GI-I7: N. I. Sokolsky, 'Classical wooden sarcophagi of the Northern Black Sea coast', and GI-I I : 'Terracottas of the Northern Black Sea coast'. These summaries are devoted to the publication of items preserved in the collections of the museums and S SCYTHIANS Dom S olTanais Olbia Niconi m mfDNei Tyras SEA OF Porthmium Batumi 0 300Km</page><page sequence="2">ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS ON THE NORTHERN SHORE OF THE BLACK SEA 49 institutes of archaeology of the USSR; they cover various subjects and are published either by a single author or by a group of researchers, thus making possible the rapid publication of very rich collections of both material from new excavations and material long preserved in museums. In the past few years a number of explorations have been carried out on the island of Leuce (White Island, the Island of Achilles), under the direction of N.V. Pyatysheva (Moscow and Odessa). Naturally the excavators wished to find the remains of the temple of Achilles, but later earthworks had severely changed the appearance of the island, and in spite of the abundance of archaeological finds the operations here have as yet yielded no promise of significant dis- coveries. In 1960 work was renewed on the island of Berezan and has since then been carried out annually under the supervision of V. V. Lapin (Kiev) and K. S. Gorbunova (Leningrad). The operations have enabled the period of settlement of the island to be dated accurately, extending it down to the end of the fourth century B.C. There have been found on the island a fifth century B.C. apsidal temple, built of mud bricks on a stone foundation, and numerous pit dwellings, private houses and public buildings. A thorough investigation of the necropolis took place, and graves were revealed dating from the end of the sixth century B.C. As had been noted in previous years, the necropolis was dug in the natural soil and the grave goods were not very rich. In one grave there were found three Corinthian aryballoi, a miniature dinos, two lydia, a Corinthian skyphos and two bowl bases that were used as small plates, on which were found ram bones; in each of the remaining graves (nineteen of them were unearthed) were one or two small vessels, copper arrows, iron knives, beads, etc. FIG. I On Berezan were found numerous examples of archaic pottery from various centres, including two fragments of a 'Rhodian-lonic' plate of the 640s or FIG. 2 FIG. 3 630s B.C., depicting an apotropaion, a sphinx and swallows (Fig. i). Most interesting of the Attic pottery were fragments of two black-figured onoi (Fig. 2), articles not found before in the North Pontic area. Especially interesting was the group of nine amphorae from Heracleia, found in a storage-pit (Fig. 3). For the study of Berezan in the early centuries A.D. a particularly interesting find was the inscription with a dedication to Achilles the Hero made by the Olbian agoranomoi. This dates from the end of the first or first half of the second century A.D. (Fig. 4). Without doubt, one of the most significant finds of recent years on the island of Berezan is the lead letter (Fig. 5), found in 1971. It is a private letter, addressed by Achillodorus to his son Anaxagoras. The contents, describing the organisation of trading operations, allow us to draw extensive conclusions about the economy of this region at the end of the sixth and beginning of the fifth centuries B.C. The letter had been rolled into a scroll and was fully preserved, but the peculiarities of the dialect and the types of expression used by the writer of the letter make reading difficult. It is now published by</page><page sequence="3">50 K. S. GORBUNOVA FIG. 4 FIG. 5 Yu. G. Vinogradov in Vestnik drevnei istorii, I97I, n. 4, 74-100. The excavations at Olbia have, in the five years under review, provided particularly important material which illustrates the life of the town at various stages. Work at Olbia is being carried out under the supervision of E. I. Levi (Leningrad); the other director, L. M. Slavin (Kiev), died in 1971i. The investigators' main efforts have been con- centrated on the Olbian agora. Earlier, a temenos was discovered to the north of the agora, with temples to Zeus and Apollo (Figs. 6a and 6b) and numerous bothroi and altars. On the south side the temenos was separated from the agora by a large stoa. Directly abutting the stoa on the west is the recently discovered court house. Its examination, conducted by A. N. Karasev, has now in the main been concluded. An accurate plan of the building has been made, and the numerous graffiti with men's names, the clay tablets for voting and, finally, two bronze ballots (psephoi) confirmed beyond any doubt the purpose of the building revealed. It should be noted that both the stoa and the court house were preserved only up to the top level of the foundation, a foundation of alter- nating layers of clay and clay mixed with ash, the normal practice of the builders of Olbia; one en- counters a similar practice in the construction of buildings in Istria. On the eastern boundary of the agora was un- earthed a row of shops; on the southern side the work of the past few years has started to reveal a gymnasium of the end of the fourth to the third centuries B.c. The rooms of the baths and a superbly executed water course of terracotta pipes were particularly well preserved (Fig. 7). In the western sector blocks of rich houses of the Hellenistic period are being uncovered (Fig. 8); they are merchants' houses since some have little shops adjacent to them: these will have been the western row of shops. The houses are of the pastas type and have many rooms and magnificantly constructed cellars; the finds from them have been quite rich. One of the houses is provisionally called the House of the Priest Agrotas. In it have been unearthed fragments of marble sculpture, much pottery and many terra-cottas. Here, too, in the western sector was found a badly damaged slab with an inscription mentioning the Olbian theatre; it was a decree in honour of an Olbian citizen, posthumously rewarded (third century B.C.). Finally, one should mention that in the last few years building remains of archaic Olbia have been uncovered right in the agora: semi-pit dwellings, cellars and a large amount of pottery. In recent years work has been carried out on the northern section of Zaya- ch'ya Balka (Hare's Gully), to the west of the town site. Here the extension of the necropolis in the early centuries A.D. was investigated, but the particu- larly important discovery is that in the second half of the sixth and the first half of the fifth centuries B.C. there was a residential area here, called by L. Slavin a suburban settlement of Olbia. Huts of pit and semi-pit construction have already been dis- covered, also household pits, and Yu. Kozub, who is studying this region, has conjectured that there was here a temple of the underworld gods. At the western end of the North Pontic Coast there has also been an investigation of Tyras (under the</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS ON THE NORTHERN SHORE OF THE BLACK SEA 51 FIG. 6a FIGo. 7 Al .7 S....l. FIG. 6b supervision of A. Furmanskaya, I. Kleyman and S. Kryzhitsky), where parts of the town and the defences have been uncovered, and of Niconium (M. Minitsin and N. Andrunina). The town of Niconium is furnishing extremely rich material of the sixth to the fourth centuries B.C., including terracottas, Attic vases, etc. Operations of great importance have been carried out along the entire coast of the Crimea. Here it is especially important to mention the systematic study of the settlements of the north-western Crimea, carried out by P. Schultz, A. Karasev, I. Yatsenko, O. Dashevskaya, A. Shcheglov. The sites studied formed part of the xw5po of Chersonesus and the majority of them originated in the period of Chersonesus' greatest prosperity, from the end of the</page><page sequence="5">52 K. S. GORBUNOVA FIG. 8 fourth to the beginning of the second century B.C. Of the greatest importance is the trading-station near the Chaika sanatorium (near Eupatoria), where archaeologists, under A. Karasev, have revealed traces of a trading-station dating right back to the end of the fifth century B.C. (Figs. 9-xo). FIG. 9 Through the efforts of A. Shcheglov, settlements, complexes of villas and isolated fortified farmsteads have been put on the map of the north-western Crimea. Here, too, the later history of the region is being traced. In the mid-second century B.c. these settlements and farmsteads were seized by the Scythians; a burnt destruction layer fixes the event precisely. On the same town site near the Chaika sanatorium there grew up on top of the burnt layer a Scythian settlement, now being excavated by I. Yatsenko. The rapid destruction of the Scythian settlement may perhaps testify to an attempt by the people of Chersonesus to recover their lost lands. Exceptional interest is being aroused by the excavation of a barrow cemetery, (on the northern border of the xpcpa of Chersonesus), carried out by the Tarkhankutsk group led by A. Shcheglov. Each barrow has an unusual plinth (crepis) and contains several graves. There is a fair amount of grave goods, and anthropomorphic tomb- stones, but the graves contain no interments. Such barrows were ex- cavated by the expedition in both 1969 and 197o, and it appears that the mystery of these peculiar cenotaphs will be cleared up only by larger-scale operations in the cemetery site. The centre of the western Crimea- Chersonesus-is the object of investiga- tions on the part of several expeditions. The most significant occasion in the study of Chersonesus in the past few years has been the discovery of a large group of tombstones of the fourth to third century B.C., laid down as building material in the core of the so-called Tower of Zeno (Fig. 11); the investiga- FIG. IO</page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS ON THE NORTHERN SHORE OF THE BLACK SEA 53 tions were led by S. Strzheletsky. Although these operations took place in I960-6I, it seems essential to mention them here. 'From the core of tower XVII 345 fragments of tomb monuments and architectural FIG. II details were extracted, of which 165 preserved the remains of polychrome decoration and 42 have inscriptions. .... Some of the stelai were successfully reassembled in full.' (Reports of Khersones Museum, iv Simpheropol 1969, 'Crimea' Publishing House). It should just be added that in recent times the number of analogous finds has increased: they are now being discovered in other sections also of the defensive walls of Chersonesus, and, moreover, the FIG. 12 last two finds retained the inscriptions splendidly; and on one of them a painted scene was fully preserved. Work has been going on at the citadel of Cher- sonesus, where a large barrack building for the Roman garrison has been found, and in the part of the town by the harbour, where the classical remains are poorly preserved because of the numerous medieval rebuildings. FiG. 13 In the northern region of Chersonesus remains of a glass-making factory were discovered in excavations under the direction of G. Belov. The many pieces of solid glass, small glass fibres and droplets, the glass dross, the fragments of glass vessels and of flat window glass lying right inside the kilns and in between them, all testify beyond doubt to the existence of glass-mak- ing workshops in Chersonesus in the third and fourth centuries A.D. In this way new pages are being written in the economic history of the town whose excavation has been going on without interruption for many decades. Undoubtedly particular interest is being aroused by the excavations at Panticapaeum, the capital of the Bosporan kingdom. Its investigation has been made difficult, as the present-day town of Kerch is sited on top of it. Nevertheless, the excavations on the slopes of Mount Mithridates have furnished extremely rich material for a study of the topography, architectural appear- ance and economy of the capital city. Expeditions have been at work continuously since 1959, led by I. Marchenko. The most significant results of recent years could well be considered to be the discovery of archaic houses, the examination of the city's defences and the finding of the prytaneum building of the second century B.C. (Figs. 12-13). Of particular importance for the solution of the question of the date of Panticapaeum's rise was the discovery in 1952 of an archaic house dating from the beginning of the sixth century B.C. Since then archaic houses and house- hold pits .have been uncovered nearly</page><page sequence="7">54 K. S. GORBUNOVA every year, though the majority of them contain items of the end of the sixth century B.C. Especially important was the discovery of an archaic pottery kiln for firing everyday wares, found in the archaic quarter in 1969, and of streets and alleys of the same period. Recent operations in the western sector of the Novo- Esplanadny district have revealed the picture of the defences of the Panticapaean acropolis. Because of stone-robbing and considerable devastation in the area, the defences of the acropolis have to be recon- structed not so much from a consideration of surviv- ing sections of the walls as by an examination of the cuttings in the rock on the salients of Mount Mithri- dates, which were organically an integral part of the fortification system. One of the salients served as the foundation of a defensive tower up to which ran the walls of the acropolis. Since 1963, work has continued on the uncovering of a large public building of the second century B.C., together with its surroundings. A Doric colonnade framed a large courtyard (80 sq. metres in area), paved with superb slabs; only on the north side was there no colonnade. Here were found fragments of together with the numerous architectural fragments which had preserved their colouring and the finds from the excavations of the prytaneum, have been published by I. Marchenko in Reports of the Pushkin State MIuseum of Fine Arts, vol. iv (Moscow, 1968), PP. 45 if- The investigations in European Bosporus have not been confined to a study of the capital of the Bosporan kingdom. The long-standing investigation of Nymph- aeum has been continued under the leadership of N. Grach. The most substantial result of the opera- tions in the territory of Nymphaeum is the discovery of Hellenistic building remains. In addition, the work of the last few years has made it possible to establish certain major changes in the history of the town planning of Nymphaeum (Fig. 14). The con- structions of the second century B.c. are on a different alignment from that of the buildings of the previous period. N. Grach notes that the orientation of the ground plan changes again in the early centuries A.D., and the site becomes once more strictly oriented to the points of the compass. Recent work has revealed over a wide area a well preserved complex of first to second century A.D. date: rr, loi r a~b T &amp;I? Li le t 4 4 4 2A dp I~f IM 1121~ \'P , \ n-r i17 i-i t \\ ?

In the rooms adjoining the colon- nade were preserved the remains of a wall painting and floor mosaics, and in one of the rooms a hearth was found. All this made it possible to explain the purpose of the building and to identify it as the prytaneum. The results of the study of this building, a slab-paved courtyard, surrounded by a few residen- tial and industrial premises with traces of industry (a pottery kiln). In the centre of the town a sequence of levels can be traced from the sixth century B.c. to the third century A.D. The extensive area that has been un- covered certainly appears to hold great promise for a clearer picture of the life of ancient Nymphaeum.</page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS ON THE NORTHERN SHORE OF THE BLACK SEA 55 Archaeologists are also working on the clarifica- tion of the defensive system of the town and on an investigation of the necropolis. Several burial vaults have been found cut into the rock. Although the tombs have been plundered, there was found in one of them a good collection of plaster ornaments from sarcophagi, which have retained their bright colour- ing. The plaster ornaments varied greatly in their subjects: a serpent-tailed goddess, Gorgon masks, volutes, palmettes, etc. There were also found some articles from the grave goods: glass vessels, bronze buckles, a ring engraved with the image of a lion. In Nymphaeum sherds of very fine Attic pottery are usually very numerous, even in the later strata and in the earth fill of pits. Operations in the territory of Myrme- cium have been of very wide scope, although they have been temporarily interrupted by the death of V. Gaidu- kevich. In his last archaeological campaigns of 1965-6 V. Gaidukevich unearthed and investigated a very important cult centre of Myrmecium, a city which was associated with the worship of Demeter and the fertility cult. Here was discovered a building of the first half of the fifth century B.c., with an altar. Traces of fire on the material filling it testified to sacrifices having been made here. Later, in the second half of the fifth and the begin- ning of the fourth centuries B.C., when the building had already ceased to exist, there grew up over it an ash heap, evidence of the fact that this place remained linked with cult even after the temple had been ruined; a good deal of pottery, animal bones, etc., was found here. In the fourth century B.C. a temple once again grew up here, consisting of several buildings. The stone altar was re-erected. But even this complex existed only until the last quarter of the fourth century B.C. In the third cen- tury B.C. there was again formed on its ruins a huge ash heap (about 50 square metres). Its investigator saw in it an eschara. The mound had been enclosed by a peculiar crepis. In the mound of the ash heap was found a vast number of objects, including terra-cottas, especially busts of Demeter. The coins found in the ash heap (Bosporan copper) clearly date the whole complex to the end of the fourth to mid-third centuries B.C. Of the other towns of European Bosporus the one most studied has been Iluratum; the excavations are being carried out by two teams: the town under the direction of I. Shurgai, the necropolis under the direction of M. Kublanov. Work in the town quarter, which abuts the south-western fortification wall, has led to the discovery of a row of residential and industrial premises, as is usual in a town of this sort. Excavations in the necropolis have provided several types of burial structures: simple rock-cut graves, vault-like rock-cut chambers of varying con- structions, and finally, discovered in 1969, a unique burial structure of the second or the first half of the third centuries A.D. This was covered by a barrow, had many chambers and was built of well-cut slabs and roofed with a semi-cylindrical vault. Even though the burial place had been plundered, the architecture of the vault lends itself to a full recon- struction (Fig. 15). Of the other settlements recently being excavated, one should mention the town site of Porthmium; the director of the excavation in 1953 was E. Kastanayan, in 1968 A. Boltunova. The location of the settlement, FIG. 15 at the narrowest part of the Kerch Strait, where it is possible that in classical times there was a ford, makes it particularly important. It has been ascertained that it grew up at the end of the sixth century B.C. and existed until the middle of the first century B.C. The abundance of imported pottery and the numerous coins testify to the lively trading operations of Porthmium and to its role in establishing a link be- tween the peninsulae of Kerch and Taman at a time prior to the formation of the Bosporan kingdom. In the opinion of A. Boltunova, the destruction of the town is connected with the events which concluded the career of Mithridates Eupator. To complete this short survey of investigations of the basic archaeological sites in the European part of the Bosporus, one ought to note the extremely fruitful</page><page sequence="9">56 K. S. GORBUNOVA research into the rural settlements of the Bosporan kingdom and, especially, the work of the expedition led by I. Kruglikova. Simultaneous excavation of several settlements makes possible the study of the genesis of these habitation sites, their conception (often in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.), their gradual enlargement, the appearance of large farmstead establishments in the fourth century B.C. (e.g. the settlement of Andreyevka South, thirteen kilometres west of Panticapaeum). Generally such farmsteads combine in one complex residential and farm pre- mises, cattle stalls and a group of grain pits. The range of agricultural articles is usually very varied. Certain of these settlements had fortifications (e.g. that of Novo-Otradnoye on the shore of the Sea of Azov) and they possibly sprang up around the numerous strongholds constructed by Asander for the defence of the Bosporan frontiers. An extremely clear picture has been given by the researches of I. Kruglikova into the rural settlement of the early centuries A.D. near the village of Semenovka (on the shore of the Sea of Azov). The results of this work have gone into I. Kruglikova's interesting study Bosporus in Late Antiquity, Sketches of Economic History (Moscow, 1966). Turning to investigations in the Asiatic part of Bosporus, one should first of all consider the arch- aeological excavations at Phanagoria. The main FIG. 16 results of the last few years have been: the discovery of the very earliest levels of Phanagoria (sixth century B.c. and late sixth-early fifth centuries B.c.), and the opening up of an artisans' quarter on the southern edge of Phanagoria, under the direction of M. Kobylina. The archaic level at Phanagoria has been revealed at a very great depth, up to 5"3 m. Even though the area of archaic Phanagoria is still not very large and although only a small section of the paving dating from the late sixth-early fifth centuries B.c. has yet been exposed, the finds already show the existence of local potters' workshops in the sixth century B.C. Then again, industrial buildings and dwellings of the fourth-century potters of Phanagoria have been found in such quantity that their investigator, M. FIG. 17 Kobylina, may speak of Phanagorian pottery (Fig. 16). Pottery kilns have been found dating from various times down to the third century A.D. Phana- gorian clay has long been distinguished and the area of its distribution clarified. Here, too, the remains of wine-making establishments have been discovered. FIG. 18</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS ON THE NORTHERN SHORE OF THE BLACK SEA 57 FIG. 19 The picture of Phanagoria as a manufacturing and industrial centre is steadily becoming more clearly defined. A major town, an industrial and cultural centre, Phanagoria also provides a large number of works of art: an abundance of terracottas (Fig. 17) and of im- ported pottery, fragments of sculpture, a pedestal from a monumental statue, unearthed recently, and marble and limestone reliefs, the publication of which will shortly be undertaken by the director of the excavations. The Taman archaeological expedition concen- trated its operations in the north-western part of the Taman peninsula, under the direction of N. Sokolsky. As a result of this work, 1968 saw the completion of the investigation of the necropolis of Cepi, executed under the direction of N. Sorokina. A cemetery dug in the natural soil was revealed, dating from the sixth century B.c. to late antiquity, and several barrows were excavated. As usual, the work on the necropolis made it possible to solve many problems concerning the town's economy, and to speak of the mixed composition of the population, of the peculia- rities and evolution of the burial ritual, and of the character of the tomb structures. The grave goods date the graves fairly accurately, and include a series of interesting terracottas, a gold pendant in the form of a lion's head, clay and glass vessels. Particularly interesting is a glass vessel of the second century A.D., fashioned in the likeness of the head of Dionysus, and judged by the excavator N. Sorokina to be Syrian. Besides the investigation of the town of Cepi and the discovery of a temple of Aphrodite, not to men- tion the finding of a statuette of the so-called Taman Aphrodite (Fig. i8), the expedition is carrying out an especially important task in the examination of the settlements with forts on the Phantalov peninsula. Precisely worked out procedures made it possible to uncover the mud-brick walls of the forts and to trace the wooden structures inside these walls. One of the towers of the town Batareika II (Fig. xg) was preserved to a height of 4"5 m; the rooms within the fort were also revealed. Built in the first century B.c., the stronghold existed until the second century A.D. and was destroyed by fire. On its ruins there grew up a new fortified settlement in late antiquity. The con- flagration baked the mud-brick, and as a result the walls of the fort have been preserved. Ten similar fortified sites have been traced and uncovered on the Phantalov peninsula, and this testifies to the strategic significance of this region, which was an island in ancient times. A clear picture of the defences has also emerged at the Ilichov town site. At the same time the expedition has recently been uncovering a series of agricultural settlements in the interior of the Taman peninsula. In 1968 in the village of Sennaya the expedition excavated an earth vault of the second century B.C. This vault enriched our collection of Sindian sculp- ture, i.e. of monuments associated with the indi- genous population of the Taman peninsula. In the flooring of the dromos were found two characteristic half-figure statues of Sindian women (Fig. 20o). The finding of the sculpture in a well-dated vault is extremely important for the accurate determination FIG. 20</page><page sequence="11">58 K. S. GORBUNOVA of the chronology of this most interesting group of monuments. The Anapa expedition, under the direction of I. Kruglikova, continued the long-established investiga- tion of ancient Gorgippia. Work is complicated by the fact that the town of Anapa almost completely covers the classical town. Moreover, during re- constructions of the town in the second and third centuries A.D. the lower levels were in many places almost entirely destroyed and removed down to natural soil. The discovery of intersecting streets, residential buildings with cellars and other building remains provides a clearer insight into the planning of the town. A new excavation, situated in a part of Gorgippia away from the sea, also helps to establish that between the sea shore and the southern boundary of the town there were no fewer than five city blocks. Of greatest interest among the finds were samples of bronze and marble sculpture, including a marble head of Aphrodite, which I. Kruglikova dates to the first or early second century A.D., and a bronze bust of a goddess with a serpent emblem (uraeus) on her head-unquestionably a representation of the syn- cretic deity whose cult was widespread in Bosporus in the early centuries A.D. In a brief survey it is difficult to mention all the archaeological excavations of classical centres in the North Pontic area. Much work is being done at Tanais. The leader of the Lower Don expedition, D. Shelov, has completed his work Tanais and the Lower Don, which sums up the results of work in this town. The Southern Don expedition has been continuing work on the Elizavetovskaya town site in the Don delta, led by I. Brashinsky. Articles from this site show its exceptional value in elucidating the special features of the commercial interchange between Greeks and Scythians in the fifth to the third centuries B.C. No less interesting is the investigation of the burials on this site, including some, discovered in 1967 and 1969, in which women had been buried, furnished with weapons. More and more attention is being paid to the Caucasian seaboard, and exploration is being con- ducted along the north-eastern shore of the Black Sea. In addition, we have recently learnt a good deal more about the classical import trade into Colchis. The surprising discoveries of the expedition to Vani, under the leadership of O. Lordkipanidze, once again testify to the wealth of Colchian culture in the fifth and fourth centuries B.c. and to her links and contacts both with the Greek and with the Scytho- Iranian world. The tomb of a Colchian warrior of the fourth century B.C., opened at Vani in 1969, represents, in the words of O. Lordkipanidze, the first herald of those new and complex features which become clearly apparent in the culture of ancient Colchis in the Hellenistic period (Fig. 21-22). In the necropolis below Batumi there have been discovered numerous Attic vases of various periods of the fifth century B.c., among them real masterpieces of Attic vase-painting; these are being prepared for publication by A. Kakhidze. In the present article attention has been deliberately confined to the excavations of the classical towns and settlements of the northern littoral of the Black Sea. The extensive work being carried out in the Crimea and in the Southern Ukraine on the construction of irrigation canals is making it possible to expose a large number of Scythian settlements and burial grounds at the same time. Thus the Kakhovsky expedition FIG. 21</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS ON THE NORTHERN SHORE OF THE BLACK SEA 59 FIG. 22 led by A. Leskov every year discovers sumptuous Scythian burial mounds, and in 1969, near the village of Archangelskaya sloboda, they dis- covered a barrow with two burials dating from the late fifth or early fourth century B.C. In the lateral, unplundered grave were found quivers, 450 arrow heads, spears and numerous gold ornaments: a massive torque with lions' heads on the terminals, on which the plugs which joined the necklace to the heads were enhanced with filigree and multicoloured enamel. 505 small metal plates adorned the shroud, and besides small triangular and cruciform plaques there were found here plates depicting Heracles, others with scenes showing a deer being torn by a lion, and plaques in the likeness of griffins. In the inner chamber of this barrow were found the remains of a wooden bowl decorated with golden chased medallions depicting fishes. In another barrow, of fourth to third century B.c. date, there was preserved the rich burial of a horse, whose harness was adorned with silver and bronze details. Perhaps the greatest sensation, however, was caused by the finding of the 'Haemon grave' barrow in the village of Balka in the Zaporozh' ye district (director V. Bidzilya). The large barrow had been plundered, but in the inner chamber were discovered silver vessels: a kylix, a small fluted jug, a large goblet, a rhyton, ending in a lion's head, and along the edge a facing depicting wild animals fighting. Most valu- able, though, was a silver two-handled vessel with gilt details (Fig. 23). On both sides of the vessel long-haired and long-bearded Scythians, armed and wearing characteristic costume, are shown striking difficult twisted poses, half-lying on improvised couches covered with skins, and making conversation. It is now necessary to study this find thoroughly, to submit every detail to a close examination and to produce a full publication. One thing is clear: this is a find on a par with the renowned Chertomlyk amphora and the Kul-Oba vase, and they provide us with supplementary information about the appearance and customs of the Scythians, about the virtuosity of the craftsman who reproduced the Scythians with ethnographic accuracy on a typical local shape of vessel and managed to combine this with the purely Greek ornamental cymation around the rim. Also of interest is the assemblage of objects, which included both a Greek silver kylix and a bronze jug; an oinochoe for wine, with the head of a satyr rising over the rim, and a situla with double- handles decorated round its rim with ovules. Such was the assemblage of works of toreutic art in the FIG. 23 inner chamber of the 'Haemon grave'. Once again one encounters the problems involved in identifying accurately the place of manufacture of such products. The Northern Pontic Coast, together with the steppes bordering on it, is a most complex and interesting region, where the question of the interaction and mutual influence of the cultures of the local and Greek populations arises most forcefully. And with every new complex we get nearer to answering those questions of classical culture which still have relevance today. The colonies situated along the Black Sea coast, from the settlement on Berezan, the smallest, but so important for the history of the Black Sea coast, to the capital city of Panticapaeum, all enrich classical archaeology annually with new facts, new buildings, new unexpected finds, as well as with an abundance of material which, though familiar, is yet always new, always fresh and shedding new light on one aspect or another of the economic and political history of the region in the classical epoch, or on one facet or another of classical culture and art.
