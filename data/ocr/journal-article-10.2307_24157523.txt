<plain_text><page sequence="1">Grammatical Errors and Feedback: Some Theoretical Insights Mathias Schulze University of Waterloo, Canada ABSTRACT This article discusses selected theoretical aspects of providing error feedback for lan guage learners. The discussion focuses on feedback for grammatical errors, but many of its tenets appear to be of broader relevance. The theoretical considerations concerning the dialog with the learner about linguistic errors are discussed, and some conclusions for CALL system design will be drawn. This discussion focuses on errors in written text production and occasionally draws on examples from parser-based CALL, in particular on insights gained during the work on Textana—a prototype of a grammar checker for English-speaking learners of German. KEYWORDS Feedback, Learning Theory, Human Computer Interaction, Grammar FEEDBACK IN CALL: NECESSARY HYPOTHESES If one of the now many CALL enthusiasts attempts to enumerate the advan tages of computer-assisted language learning, in order to persuade a (not yet) converted language teacher, the latter might ask the former what the computer (program) can do and the (grammar or text) book cannot. The likely reply is that the computer (program) is praised for its capability of providing immediate feedback. This answer usually does the trick and establishes the superiority of computers over grammar books, until somebody counters by saying that, of course, good grammar books provide feedback by giving the correct answers in the appendix of the book or in a little booklet which has to be purchased sepa rately. ... Now a real discussion on feedback can develop .... Feedback is most commonly understood as a technical term: feedback: a principle used in self-regulating control systems. Information about what is happening in a system (such as level of temperature, engine speed or size of a workpiece) is fed back to a controlling device, which compares it with what should be happening. If the two are different, the device takes suitable action (such as switching on a heater, allowing more steam to the engine, or resetting the tools). (Upshall, 1993, p. 337) CALICO Journal, 20 (3), p-p 437-450. © 2003 CALICO Journal</page><page sequence="2">Grammatical Errors and Feedback: Some Theoretical Insights This understanding of feedback is usually associated with the notion of a servo system: servo system: an automatic control system used in aircraft, motor cars, and other complex machines. A specific input, such as moving a lever or joy stick, causes a specific output, such as feeding current to an electric motor that moves, for example, the rudder of the aircraft. At the same time the position of the rudder is detected and fed back to the central control, so that small adjustments can continually be made to maintain the desired course. (Upshall, 1993, p. 892) Of course, the term feedback is also frequently used in psychology and peda gogy in a surprisingly similar way. Annett (1969, p. 26), in his book Feedback and human behaviour, claims that "the concept of feedback can be applied to the analysis of behavior ranging from simplest of movements to complex prob lem-solving tasks.... The general term used since about the turn of the century for a variety of forms of psychological feedback is knowledge of results (KR)." He further explains that this kind of feedback is usually intrinsic. "When the experimenter adds an additional feedback loop this may be called extrinsic KR or augmented feedback. The most common example is the addition of informa tion regarding the standard of performance." (p. 27) The feedback loop for giving extrinsic or augmented feedback in grammar learning is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Feedback Loop in Grammar Learning Computer (or teacher) compare feedback defined structures a submit used structures Learner 438 CALICO Journal Computer (or teacher) compare feedback defined structures a submit used structures Learner</page><page sequence="3">Mathias Schulze Learners submit textual input to the computer. This input is constructed on the basis of the grammatical competence learners have. The parser compares the used structures with the structures it can analyse with its computational grammar and generates feedback which is based on the results of this compari son. (Human teachers produce feedback on the basis of the comparison with their internalised grammar.) Learners have then the choice to confirm their struc tures or revise the submitted input in line with the feedback given. It is at this place that the feedback loop for (human) learners differs from a similar feed back loop for a technical device—a machine has no choice but to revise the input based on the feedback information. Using this general understanding as the starting point, this article discusses different variables that influence the quality of feedback. The complex nature of feedback in language learning necessitates a multifaceted approach to its description, design, and implementation. Given that we are interested in the provision of help in a language learning situation and that the implementation of the feedback algorithm will be in a (parser-based) CALL application, the concept of feedback will be discussed in three different aspects: 1. psychology and learning theories, 2. second language acquisition theories, and 3. human-computer interface design. A discussion of feedback from a linguistic perspective, which is an important fourth aspect, can be found in Schulze (1999). LEARNING PSYCHOLOGY AND FEEDBACK Relevant findings of behaviorist psychology will be outlined here. Behavior ist psychology provides the starting point of this excursion into learning psy chology for two reasons: First, behaviorist psychologists imposed strict rules for experiments they conducted, i.e. concentrating on observable stimuli and responses and avoiding any speculation about unobservable processes. These observations were very often recorded by using quantitative measures. Results are therefore closely related to some mathematical understanding, which, in turn, is closer to the world of computing. Second, the concept of reinforcement is frequently used in behaviorist learning psychology and appears to be related to the concept of feedback under investigation here. The assumption is that feedback of a certain kind can act as a reinforcer. Much of the research in learning psychology has been based on experiments with animals. Is reinforcement really a factor which has to be taken into consid eration when talking about human behavior and in particular about learning? Lieberman (1990, p. 208) argues in this context: "When reinforcement is used in accordance with all these principles, it can be substantially more powerful than our everyday experience might suggest." The principles to which he re ferred are the following: Volume 20 Number 3 439</page><page sequence="4">Grammatical Errors and Feedback: Some Theoretical Insights 1. The kind of reinforcer used is important. The Premack principle says that the strength of a reinforcer can be determined by observing how much time subjects dedicate to the reinforcer if it is freely available. In a learning context, we could ask: what efforts are learners prepared to undertake if they want to gain social recognition, improve their group status, be successful, and so forth? 2. Under these conditions, secondary reinforcers—reinforcers that satisfy no immediate basic need (e.g., grades, points, or scores)—can be as powerful as primary ones if they are paired with a primary reinforcer, examples of which were mentioned under 1. 3. "To generate a high rate of responding, which will persist even if rein forcement is not available for some period, partial reinforcement sched ules are preferable to continuous reinforcement—especially variable ration and interval schedules, in which the reinforced response cannot easily be predicted." (Lieberman, 1990, p. 207) In other words, rein forcement should not be used after each response, but only intermit tently and certainly in fashion that is not transparent to the learner. 4. The quality of responding to a reinforcer depends on motivation, which, in tum, depends on how deprived the subject was of the reinforcer and on the incentive value of the reinforcer. "The Yerkes-Dodson law says that the optimum level of motivation for learning depends on the diffi culty of the task. For simple tasks, high motivation is helpful; on more difficult tasks, strong motivation can narrow attention in a way that interferes with learning." (Lieberman, 1990, p. 207) 5. In order to achieve an occurrence of a response in a wide variety of situational settings, it has to be reinforced in a variety of settings.This principle, of course, coincides with the more general idea of applying a variety of methods (e.g., learning tasks and exercise types). If in each of these different learning situations certain behavioral traits are reinforced, the stimulus-response relationship is going to be more stable. 6. "When a response is difficult to leam, it may be possible to shape it first by first reinforcing a simpler response, and only gradually requiring closer approximations to the target behavior." (Lieberman, 1990, p. 208) If one considers the six principles listed above in the context of language learning and computer-assisted language learning in particular, then it is evi dent that reinforcement plays a role in these processes, if only due to recurring patterns in learning tasks and exercises, in praise and criticism. Of course, in modem teaching situations, most of the reinforcers used are of a social nature— mainly in terms of social recognition of one kind or another—rather than a material one. Consequently, we have to ask what role exactly does reinforcement play in learning theory? One learning theorist frequently associated with early devel opments in CALL was Skinner. His position emphasized the effects of a re 440 CALICO Journal</page><page sequence="5">Mathias Schulze sponse on the response itself. Skinner concluded that the effects of reinforce ment and punishment are not symmetrical; that is, reinforcement changes the probability of a response's recurring, but punishment does not. As CALL prac titioners and researchers know, his work led to the development of programmed learning and teaching machines. As Hergenhahn and Olson (1997, p. 105) have stated, Skinner, like Thorndike, was very interested in applying his theory of learn ing to the process of education. To Skinner, learning proceeds most effec tively, if (1) the information to be learned is presented in small steps, (2) the learners are given rapid feedback concerning the accuracy of their learning (i.e. they are shown immediately after a learning experience whether they have learned the information correctly or incorrectly), and (3) the learners are able to learn at their own pace. Of course, many arguments have been made since for and against programmed learning and behaviorist theories in general. It is striking, though, that rein forcement has remained an important category in the discussion of learning. For most behaviorists, reinforcement is a necessary condition for learning. ... In contrast, most cognitive theorists believe that learning occurs indepen dently of reinforcement. For them, what reinforcement does is provide the organism with information that can act as an incentive to translate what has already been learned into behavior. (Hergenhahn &amp; Olson, 1997, p. 450) In any case, when designing a language learning tool, findings of learning psychology cannot be ignored for practical reasons. We can conclude from the many successful experiments cited in the literature on reinforcement (both Lieberman, 1990 and Hergenhahn &amp; Olson, 1997 provide a good overview) that feedback can act as a powerful reinforcer. Knowledge of results, verbal praise, scores, and so on not only confirm or disconfirm the correctness of gram matical structures in the language learning process, but they also (at least poten tially) reinforce certain behavioral patterns. Even if one constructs the worst case scenario and claims that reinforcement has no influence on language learn ing, then it is still an important factor to be considered when designing the program or tool because reinforcement can certainly influence the behavior to wards the computer program and thus indirectly influence the learning experi ence. On the other hand, of course, there are some inherent problems with rein forcement that need to be considered and, if possible, avoided when it comes to providing feedback. Reinforcement should not be bribery because then the de sired response would not be achieved in the absence of a reinforcer. The mildest reinforcer possible ought to be used. "If reinforcement is seen as a means of control for the benefit of the controller, then it is less likely to be effective." Volume 20 Number 3 441</page><page sequence="6">Grammatical Errors and Feedback: Some Theoretical Insights (Lieberman, 1990, p. 275) This is one of the differences between humans and animals reacting to reinforcers. Humans can act adversely when praised for responding exactly as the subject in charge of the reinforcer expected. Given the fact that in a computer-assisted language learning situation the incentives and thus the reinforcement is controlled by a machine, this adverse reaction to praising learners for having done exactly as they have been told is most likely to be much stronger. The term bribery not only refers to the use of excessive material reinforcers (e.g., large sums of money), but also to the inflationary use of (often one and the same) praise words such as "excellent" and "brilliant." If such praise words are given as feedback to all correct answers, as is the case in a number of CALL programs, then they soon loose their power as a reinforcer (see again the third principle listed above). Similar caution is necessary when attempting to weaken an unwanted response, for example, the application of an inappropriate grammatical rule. Negative reinforcement—punishment—was widely discussed in behaviorist literature. "Early research suggested that punishment had only a temporary effect on be havior, but more recently research has reversed this conclusion. When punish ment is immediate, firm, accompanied by a clear (and fair) explanation, and when it occurs in a variety of settings, it can be a very powerful tool for elimi nating undesirable behavior." (Lieberman, 1990, p. 243) However, the dangers are great. Punishment, already in its mildest form (e.g., negative comments) can result in the following: 1. harmful side effects, 2. fear and/or anxiety which then inhibits attention, and 3. a tendency towards increased aggression (here the punishing subject being used as a model). Therefore, it appears to be best that no computer operation should be per formed that can be perceived as punishment by learners due to the potential side effects of negative reinforcement and its relatively unpredictable and low suc cess rate. At first, this sounds fairly obvious, but if one considers the fact that a number of (language) learning packages offer feedback like "Wrong!," "Incor rect!," "False," or simply "No" and if one accepts that these short phrases can be perceived as mild social punishment, then it becomes clear that careful con sideration must be given to the formulation of feedback messages to linguistic errors. The often negative side effects of punishment can be seen in programs which sound a high-pitched tone if an error was made. To the embarrassment of learners, this tone is heard right across the classroom. It does not take much to imagine what this kind of negative reinforcement does to the motivation of the learners and to their willingness to experiment with language. It is not only in behaviorist approaches to learning that information on feed back can be found. In information-processing psychology, feedback is similarly defined as in servomechanisms; it forms a loop between the input and output of 442 CALICO Journal</page><page sequence="7">Mathias Schulze an action in that the output serves as information on the adequacy of the input. This information-processing approach to psychology can be subsumed under cognitive psychology. Tolman, a psychologist in the cognitive tradition who took his lead from the Gestalt theorists, argues that learning is not the learning of stimulus-response relationships as the behaviorists believe, but the discovery of what leads to what. He rejected the notion of reinforcement as unimportant ... but there is some similarity between what Tolman called confirmation and what the other behaviorists called reinforcement. During the develop ment of a cognitive map, expectations are utilized by the organisms.... Early tentative expectations are called hypotheses, and they are either confirmed by experience or not. Hypotheses that are confirmed are retained, and those that are not are abandoned. (Hergenhahn &amp; Olson, 1997, p. 302) In Bandura's theory, reinforcement has two major functions. First it creates an expectation in observers [see observational learning] that if they act like a model who has been seen being reinforced for certain activities, they will be reinforced also. Second, it acts as an incentive for translating learning into performance. (Hergenhahn &amp; Olson, 1997, p. 334) It can be seen from these short sketches of cognitive approaches to learning in general and feedback in particular that they might define reinforcement dif ferently (or label it differently), but the concept remains an important one in the attempt to explain learning processes. The consideration of reinforcement in computer-assisted language learning is particularly important because repeti tion is inherent in many CALL programs and makes reinforcement of certain linguistic and nonlinguistic behavioral traits more likely. Different learning theo ries can inform aspects of CALL design in that they highlight potential benefits and dangers of reinforcement, knowledge of results, and feedback in general. Strong criticism of the concept of reinforcement as an explanatory tool for language acquisition came from within linguistics. These criticisms have also shaped what is known today as second language acquisition theory. SECOND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION THEORIES AND FEEDBACK These behaviorist views have now been discredited. Chomsky's (1959) re view of Skinner's Verbal behavior set in motion a re-evaluation of many of the central claims. The dangers of extrapolating from laboratory studies of animal behavior to the language behavior of humans were pointed out. The terms 'stimulus' and 'response' were exposed as vacuous where language behavior was concerned. 'Analogy' could not account for the language user's ability to generate totally novel utterances. Furthermore, studies of children acquiring their LI showed that parents rarely corrected their children's lin guistic errors, thus casting doubt on the importance of 're-inforcement' in language learning .... These studies suggested that language acquisition Volume 20 Number 3 443</page><page sequence="8">Grammatical Errors and Feedback: Some Theoretical Insights was developmental in nature, driven as much, if not more, from the inside as from the outside. (Ellis, 1994, p. 300) The application of Chomsky's hypothesis of an innate universal grammar to second language acquisition is still somewhat controversial (e.g., see Cook &amp; Newson, 1996). The exact influence of universal grammar (UG) on second lan guage acquisition processes is viewed differently by different SLA researchers; UG is either seen as playing a major part, some part, or no part at all in these processes. (For a detailed discussion, see Cook &amp; Newson, 1996.) However, there appears to be a consensus as to the existence of the language acquisition device, a cognitive faculty dedicated to the processes of language acquisition. Of course, rejecting the idea that language acquisition can be explained solely in behaviorist terms does not mean that we can ignore stimulus-response rela tionships and reinforcement in language learning altogether. Current thinking about second language learning and acquisition is also still influenced by Krashen's (1985) hypotheses which also show the importance of other cogni tive faculties apart from the language acquisition device. He assumes that learners have two systems for dealing with a second language: an acquired and a learned system. The former is the result of communication, the latter is the result of conscious attention to language and the learning of rules and items. Krashen's view that these two systems are not related has been heavily disputed and can now be seen as disproved. Long (1991), for example, has tested the hypothesis and has strongly argued in favor of a focus on form in language learning and teaching. (For a more detailed discussion, see Schulze, 1998.) Long also argued for the effectiveness of certain kinds of feedback. The widely accepted view that second language is acquired and learned en tails that other cognitive faculties than the language acquisition device have to be used. In other words, independent of whether one presupposes the existence of a universal grammar and a language acquisition device, it is clear that other cognitive processes contribute to the learning and the acquisition of a foreign language, and, more importantly, some of these processes could at least benefit from feedback and reinforcement. Thus, the role of neither feedback nor rein forcement should be ignored when design issues in computer-assisted language learning are considered. Feedback in language learning is mainly done by treating linguistic errors. A number of terms have been used to refer to the general area of error treat ment; these are 'feedback', 'repair', and 'correction'. 'Feedback' serves as a general cover term for the information provided by listeners on the recep tion and comprehension of messages. As Vigil and Oller ( 1976) have pointed out, it is useful to distinguish 'cognitive' and 'affective' feedback; the former relates to actual understanding while the latter concerns the motivational support that interlocutors provide each other with during an interaction. 'Re pair' is a somewhat narrower term used by ethnomethodologists such as Schegloff, Jefferson, and Sacks (1977) to refer to attempts to identify and 444 CALICO Journal</page><page sequence="9">Mathias Schulze remedy communication problems, including those that derive from linguis tic errors. 'Correction' has a narrower meaning still, referring to attempts to deal specifically with linguistic errors; it continues an attempt to supply 'nega tive evidence' ... in the form of feedback that draws the learners' attention to the errors they have made. (Ellis, 1994, pp. 583-584) With reference to cognitive feedback, Ellis (1994) points out on the basis of a study by Vigil and Oiler (1976) that positive cognitive feedback results in fos silization, whereas negative feedback causes learners to work on their error. Here, positive cognitive feedback means that the recipient of a message signals that he or she understood the message independent of the number of errors. Negative feedback refers to a reply which says that the utterance has not been understood. Even more precise information on the nature of effective feedback is provided by Pica and others who established that the main factor was the nature of the feedback signals (cited in Ellis, 1994). Lyster and Ranta (1997) came to a similar conclusion. Learners tended to rephrase their utterances upon clarification requests but were less likely to rephrase after confirmation requests or repetitions. In other words, if errors trigger a clarification request which sig nals that what the learner said has not been understood, the learner is much more likely to work on the error. This result can also be achieved by a computer program which simply indicates to students that it could not fully process the input because there were errors in the text. Naturally, this kind of information can only be the 'trigger-message' which causes students to reconsider their in put. Further help needs to be given in order for them to be able to correct the error. It has to be mentioned at this stage that the pointing out of linguistic errors to foreign-language learners has been the subject of some controversy mainly over whether the provision of negative evidence is necessary or helpful for L2 devel opment (Mitchell &amp; Myles, 1998). The problem here is that very little evidence has been found which would confirm the effectiveness of telling language learn ers that a sentence or phrase is not acceptable according to the norms of the target language. However, there are some areas for which negative feedback has been confirmed as effective. Mitchell and Myles (1998) summarize the achievements of interactionist research regarding feedback by stating that learners who received negative feedback can have an advantage when later tested on those structures. Long (1996) confirms that negative feedback can facilitate language learning at least for vocabulary, morphology, and language-specific syntax. Error feedback has also received some attention in the discussion on the hypothesis of comprehensible output (Swain, 1985; Ellis, 1994). Based on research in second language acquisition, more and more CALL programs place emphasis on providing learners with opportunities to test hy potheses in comprehensible output, on the negotiation of meaning by providing cognitive feedback, and, of course, on the important role of error feedback in general. Volume 20 Number 3 445</page><page sequence="10">Grammatical Errors and Feedback: Some Theoretical Insights Having explored selected concepts of feedback in second language acquisi tion theory, we will now turn to the last area to be investigated—that of human computer interaction. HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION AND FEEDBACK Human-computer interaction (HCl) is an area of research that deals with ques tions of interface and dialog design. It is only the latter that will concern us here. In other words, the two questions for this section are: 1. What are the characteristics of human-computer interaction by com parison to human-human interaction? 2. Which findings of HCl research are applicable to the provision of feed back by a grammar program for foreign language learners? The differences between humans and machines have obviously to be taken into consideration in order to understand the interaction of learners with CALL programs: 1. Machines are compiled out of individual parts for a very specific pur pose; whereas humans are holistic entities whose parts can be differen tiated. 2. Humans process all sorts of experiences and repeatedly and interac tively create their own environment—something machines cannot do. They 'calculate' a problem on the basis of pre-wired rules. 3. The main features of human thoughts are their inherent contradictions and the ability to cope with them—something that will not be comput able due to its complexity, variety, and degree of detail. (Schmitz, 1992, 209f.) Schmitz by no means attempts to diminish the capabilities of computers. He claims that computers can theoretically carry out all operations, but never ac tions because they do not recognize aims, purpose, or position of the action. The differences between humans and machines can for our purposes (i.e., the theoretical description of human-computer interaction) be legitimately reduced to the distinction between actions and operations as is done in Activity Theory. The proponents of Activity Theory, for example, Leontiev and Vygotsky, view humans very much as social beings whose psyche is developed in activity, that is, mainly in social interaction and in actions within an environment. The main categories used are activity, action, and operation: If activity may be correlated to motive and action to aim, then operation may be correlated to conditions. This simplest psychological unit of activity is subordinate to action, and therefore in turn to activity as a whole. ... The correlation between activity, actions, and operations is dynamic. Operations can at first be directed towards a conscious aim, i.e. be actions; they then become automatic and vanish from man's consciousness. There is, however, another type of operation, which emerges as the result of unconscious adap 446 CALICO Journal</page><page sequence="11">Mathias Schulze tation and probing for the right way to act. (Leontiev, 1981, pp. 17-18) Communicative activities can be divided into actions which are intentional (i.e., goal-driven), and actions can be subdivided into operations which are con dition triggered. These operations are normally learnt as actions. The situation is best illustrated with an example: switching gears when driving a car. The learner/driver is asked by the driving instructor to change gears, and this re quest becomes the goal of the learner. Once the learner/driver has performed this action a sufficient number of times, this action becomes more and more automated and, in the process, loses more and more of its intentionality. A pro ficient driver might have the goal to accelerate the car which will necessitate switching into higher gear, but this is now triggered by a condition (the differ ence between engine speed and speed of the car). It can thus be argued that humans learn to perform complex actions by learning to perform certain opera tions in a certain order. Machines, on the other hand, are only made to perform certain (sometimes rather complex) operations. Sequences of such operations can be performed by sophisticated machines like computers in rapid succession (or with powerful computers even in parallel), but each and every one of them is initialized by a condition (e.g., a mouse click or keyboard input). Because they are not subordinated to an intention, they cannot be described as actions (Schmitz, 1992). Activity Theory has some bearing on our understanding of the human-com puter interaction that takes place when a learner uses language learning soft ware. When, for instance, the spellchecker is started in a word-processing pack age, the software certainly does not have the intention to proofread the learner's document. The computer just responds to the clicking of the spellchecker menu item and performs the operation of comparing the strings in the document against the entries in a machine dictionary. The result of the comparison triggers the next operation: if an identical string has been found in the dictionary, the next string from the document is compared; if an identical string is not found in the dictionary, similar strings will be selected from the dictionary according to an established algorithm and displayed to the user as spelling alternatives. For the computer user (in our case, a learner), it might look like the computer is proof reading the document—one realizes that no 'proper' document checking is go ing on only if a correctly spelled word is not found in the dictionary or nonsense alternatives are given for a simple spelling error. Let us compare this interaction with an interaction between two people. Per son X interacts with Person Y in that he observes Person Y's action, reasons about the likely intention for that action, and reacts according to this assumed intention. It appears to be the case that many learners transfer this approach to the interaction with a computer in a language learning situation; they interpret the sequence of operations performed by the computer as an action, reason about the 'intention' of the computer, and react accordingly. This explains, for ex ample, why many learners, when an answer they believe to be right is rejected by the computer, get just as frustrated as they would if it were rejected by their Volume 20 Number 3 447</page><page sequence="12">Grammatical Errors and Feedback: Some Theoretical Insights tutor. Of course, an ideal computer-assisted language learning system would avoid such pitfalls and not reject a correct response or overlook an incorrect one. Since any existing system can only approximate this ideal, researchers and developers in CALL can only attempt to build systems that are capable of per forming complexly structured sequences of (linguistic) operations so that learners can interact meaningfully and successfully with the computer. This conclusion takes us to the second question posed above: Which findings of HCl research are applicable to the provision of feedback by a grammar checker for foreign language learners? It has already been said that the main focus here is on the dialog aspect of human-computer interaction. O'Shea and Self (1983) emphasize the importance of implementing a "dialog system" in any Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). Sutcliffe (1995) discusses principles of dialog design from the perspective of HCL As the first criterion he uses the term 'feedback' by which he means that the computer user is continuously informed about what is going on. With regard to error messages in general, Shneiderman (1992) out lines the following principles: 1. specificity, 2. constructive guidance and positive tone, 3. user-centered phrasing, and 4. appropriate physical format. It has to be noted that with user-centered phrasing Shneiderman argues against the use of anthropomorphic instructions because the pretense that the computer is a 'human' cannot be sustained for a long period of time, and will not be appreciated by (adult) computer users. It can be safely assumed that these prin ciples for error messages in general can and must also be applied to messages that relate to errors the learner made in producing a foreign language text. This is so because both kinds of messages (those for computer users as well as those for language learners) are generated by a computer program. When discussing features of intelligent help systems, Sutcliffe (1995) outlines the following com ponents: dialog manager, user model, diagnostic module (lexical, syntactic, and semantic), and a remediation-repair planner. It is apparent how similar this catalog of desiderata is to one for an intelligent tutoring system. HCl research also provides some answers concerning the timing of feedback: Only one problem at a time should be presented to the user. "Novices to tasks exhibit better performance and prefer to work at slower speeds than knowl edgeable frequent users." (Shneiderman, 1992, pp. 256-257) Short response times are quick and enjoyable, longer response times motivate the users to exer cise more care and make fewer errors. Shneiderman reports from an experi ment: "Overall, subjects working at the shorter response time completed their lessons more quickly and had a favorable attitude toward the system. There were clear indications that subjects tried to work more carefully and made fewer errors with the longer response time." (Shneiderman, 1992, p. 290) 448 CALICO Journal</page><page sequence="13">Mathias Schulze CONCLUSION If one subscribes to the opinion that error correction is a worthwhile activity in the language learning process, then both the error diagnosis process and the provision of feedback ought to be based on a sound theoretical understanding. This article showed how selected information from second language acquisi tion theory, learning psychology and human-computer interaction research can be utilized by designers of CALL software. Of particular importance are: 1. a concise and adequate description of errors, 2. the consideration of issues like reinforcement, which is going to be par ticularly strong in exercises with repeated elements, and the dangers associated with feedback that can be perceived as social punishment, 3. a good understanding of second language acquisition processes (e.g., the advantage of negative cognitive feedback) and the general role of corrective feedback in language learning, and 4. a careful consideration of the traits of human computer interaction.
