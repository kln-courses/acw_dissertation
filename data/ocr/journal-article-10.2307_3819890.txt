<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poetic Idiom Among the Akye of C6te d'Ivoire: The Agnanda-nou Agnes Monnet The notion of poetic language is a present and effective reality among the Akye in Cote d'Ivoire. As in the area of music, the Akye distinguish between a "full word" (i.e., a truly creative language) and an "empty word" in poetry. The "full word" exists alongside the "empty word" just as a "full music" (i.e., a truly creative music) exists in opposition to an "empty music" that is derived from a certain code (Ruwet 26). The "empty word" is what the Akye call veuveu-nou orpiya-nou, (liter- ally "entertaining speech," "low speech," or even "light speech"). The Wolof speak of waxu kaw (surface idiom) and of waxu suuf (deep or beautiful idiom) (see Sene 5); in Akye, the same concept is known as agnanda-nou. This distinction was formu- lated by one of the great teachers of our oral tradition, Gbazza Madou Dibero, who insists that the artist-the true artist-does not have any gaps in his imagination, whereas the gaps in a non-artist's idiom reveal the failure of his imagination. The Akye word agnanda-nou consists of two parts: nou means "the word that is sung," and it can be either vulgar or serious, profane or sacred, whereas agnanda has often been translated by the word "proverb." Admittedly, agnanda overlaps with or incorporates the word "proverb," but it also transcends the various discursive practices that are designated as proverbs, especially when the proverb is defined as a maxim that has become popular and is expressed in few words. According to Atsain N'Cho, a/gna/nda literally means "one/say/news" (in the sense of what is new or secret); it conveys a sense for the character of what is not ordinary-of what does not happen every day-and therefore appears to be mysterious. Agnanda, as the Akye say, is the product of what the individual perceives and experiences. Among all these various definitions, the one we would like to empha- size is the one that views agnanda as that which permits the root causes of events to be apprehended. In this sense of the word, it takes on a mythic aspect. As a mode of expression, agnanda goes beyond the word "proverb" to incorporate what stylistici- ans call "facts of style." This extended field of application for terms such as agnanda is what prompted Yves Emmanuel Dogbe to assert that the equivalent of all Euro- pean rhetorical devices can be found in the African proverb (101). Agnanda-nou is therefore the word that is sung-the word that extends into the realm of sensibility, imagination, and the poet's imaginary through the use of</page><page sequence="2">110 I Research in African Literatures metaphors, comparisons, metonymies, allegories, and symbols. A dense, polymor- phous, and polysemic idiom, the agnanda-nou finds inspiration in all the elements of nature: animals, insects, birds, trees, rivers, etc. And the law of metamorphosis, which affects all elements, remains intensely alive. Otherwise, the Akye oral poet Adou R6en would never have spoken in the following way when he bemoans the absence of his wife, who has run off with his best friend: Aik he j: mwe w5 16 kp6tokpod3i-je-o-l1 tf6k6li k + wb5jwywb diub adu' lne m Ile b3 jak6 [Oh, friends! When the mangrove falls ill the woodpecker rejoices! As for the touraco, he weeps! (...) Adou R6ne! What a pity!] Thus, the agnanda-nou can be regarded as a poetic idiom, analyzable in terms of the poetic function as defined by Roman Jakobson. In addition to the ritual of images, the musical qualities of the agnanda-nou are also important, as can be seen in the reiterations and parallelisms of the follow- ing excerpt from an agnanda-nou: be me d3i1jw ji mE d3ijiw ji mg d3ijwa bg me d3ijiw sE je mE d3ijwa s? ak'do kwafi w5 n5 mg l1 ajaho akodo kwafi w5 n me la [Oh! this business torments me Oh! it torments me Oh! what pain Oh! this business torments me Oh! it torments me! O Akondo Kouachi come fall asleep in my arms. (...) O Akondo Kouachi! Come so I may sleep.] Following Jakobson, we recognize that the literary text transcends the pure commu- nicative function of utilitarian and transitive language (see Borgomano). The care with which the performers of agnanda-nou clothe words, make them wear masks, and open them to one another in tonal and rhythmic patterns justifies us in regard- ing it as a poetic idiom par excellence. More than a celebration of image and rhythm, agnanda-nou is a "word" of ori- gins. Akye poetic speech is essentially an initiatory form of expression, the product of an imaginative leap and a religious fervor that reconcile everything on earth. The way in which the imagination frees itself and travels into another universe-what Bernard Zadi-Zaourou calls the "parallel universe"-is what moves the Akye. The emotions, subtle and discreet, become more intimate, and the poeticity of the word opens to us "the doors of a marvelous universe in which the poet actually radiates because he has become the work of his own genius and because his madness has free rein there" (541). In addition to its poetic qualities (rhythm, sound, image), the evocative and heuristic power of the word is paramount in the agnanda-nou.</page><page sequence="3">Agns Monnet I 111 African culture includes a family of words whose values are not determined solely by the words that surround them in a spoken utterance. This phenomenon is the basis for Zadi Zaourou's notion of an axis of symbolization-an abstract, imagi- nary axis along which words acquire a certain primordial value. By means of this process, the word is projected onto the spoken utterance, charged with a past, an entire history that allows one to speak about a poetic usage of the referential func- tion, a poetization of the referent (Cuche cited in Zadi Zaourou 541). If the notion of the "poetization of the referent" can be accepted from a theoretical point of view, we still need to examine the phenomenon from a practical perspective. To address this problem adequately, we must focus specifically on Africans and their cultures; in fact, Africans have inventoried their respective cultures and interpreted them in relationship to the signs that are offered to them by nature. They have discovered connections among these signs, thereby defining complex networks of symbolic correspondence which, as a whole, form a system of meaning. Consequently, when one encounters a word that belongs to the above-mentioned family of words, one is obliged, if one desires to understand its function, to identify the symbolic network to which it belongs and to analyze its function in relation to the entire system. In this way, one discovers entire stories behind words and their referents. Once this principle has been grasped, these words become a doorway opening into a universe that is whole and complex. This phenomenon can be seen in the text entitled "The Words of the Mongoose": h. mjEho pi-a-j? be 15 batso 6 ne bw+ ajada dze j dz+ng 'j keke kp ke dz + a-1 le dze ji dz-+n il+ j bef'k; 6 k-+k+ 6 k+k b6 ba kwe n bo6 k J'e japo jSke se b6natfi yje tfU-m -f5 kwi f~ jE me yij e I b [The eye observes and the belly keeps the secret Said the mongoose in a proverb It is raining in the heavens An extraordinary event is taking place there in the heavens Thus, it's raining there in the heavens The tortoise showed how to kill her So the people killed her and ate her Eh! Yapo Guionke! The waters are rising And the sea has tossed me back unto the shore So the hour of death is upon me.] In this example, the first two lines are of primary importance for us. A deeper under- standing of these words depends upon an awareness of the time when the mongoose spoke and the circumstances in which she formulated her discourse. In fact, the decoding of these words reveals an unsuspected richness of words in Akye culture. Everything happens as if one had entered a milieu where anything was possible. Death or life. As the following story illustrates, one is on the threshold of mystery: Long ago, when animals were not yet animals, Mongoose and her friend Sheep went fishing, accompanied, quite naturally, by their children. When evening came and our two friends were attacking the fish that had been caught in the</page><page sequence="4">112 I Research in African Literatures trap and were unable to escape, Panther appeared. Mongoose, who had care- fully observed Panther's slightest movements and divined his sinister inten- tions, continued to act as if nothing were wrong, although she did quietly order her children to go and cut some reeds to help divide the day's catch, but only after having whispered to them not to return to the fishing grounds. Mean- while, Mother Sheep and her children, in the blind ignorance that character- izes them, continued to wage war on the last survivors among the fish. When Panther expressed his impatience at not seeing the Mongoose's children return, Mother Mongoose offered to go and find them. After unsuccessfully calling her "disobedient" progeny who were "behaving intolerably," Mother Mongoose went behind a bush and ran off as fast as her feet would carry her. At that moment, Panther unleashed his claws, laid hold of Mother Sheep and her children, and pitilessly devoured them. In the agnanda-nou "The Words of the Mongoose," the term "mongoose" is mean- ingful only in relation to the above story, which obviously takes place at the begin- ning of time. This meaning prevails in the minds of Akye speakers, who do not see the mongoose as "a carnivorous animal of the viverridae family in Africa and Asia, a great predator of snakes" (Quillet). If this story does not take into account the value of the referent-symbol, there is an entire religious tradition that does, and it is evident in the case of Akoudzin Sonan in the agnanda-nou "Libation": dz-+ e dzapt ma mo w no ts m5 afEkwg f6 s5 mb6o s3 bibC s5 E I f m ma m w5 no ts' m3 1o mik X 1S' Il e no ts? ha mja ke ha b6fkp6lo stpe li ha he k6 haiwf 5a ba akudzg sSnS b5 ma b5 hS ha hwFv + b5jE-h _-f3--j s t pe l1 bo mf mS i bi mg fs-ju 15k 15k [Heaven and earth, come partake of this drink O Achekoiche, stream of many meanderings Sacred river Ancestors and spirits, come partake of this drink That day, a day of misfortune for us We were kneeling in the mud We were shouting and weeping O Akoudzin Sonan! You were the one who took pity on us You lifted us from the mud Never, never would you admit that your child is covered with mud.] "Akoudzin Sonan" has a basic meaning (stream of many meanderings). It serves as a referent that can be located geographically and described in objective terms (a stream located at a particular place in Akye country, having its source at another place, measuring so many kilometers in length... ). But what occurs in the utter- ance that we have cited above? This basic meaning is supplanted, and we are left with the problem of identifying the real value of the referent. Nothing in the lin- guistic environment of these words ("mongoose," "Akoudzin Sonan") can confer upon them the values that are comprehensible only in terms of the Saussurian law that no word has any value in and for itself because its value derives solely from the other words that surround it in a spoken utterance.</page><page sequence="5">Agns Monnet I 113 In the practice of agnanda-nou, one must go beyond the discourse itself to dis- cover the basic values about which we have been speaking. At this point, we are obliged to recognize the existence of a tradition that is transmitted by religious instruction or by oral texts-a tradition which insists that Akoudzin Sonan is a river only in appearance and that the mongoose is a viverrida only to the naive. Akoud- zin Sonan is essentially the dwelling place of other forces, of spirits and ancestors. As for the mongoose (who is vested with her characteristic powers of observation, judgment, and discernment), she is a symbol of intelligence and wisdom: a behav- ioral model that serves to inspire the Akye people. So how can we speak about per- sonification or metaphor? The process of poetic communication implied in the agnanda-nou actually involves a leap of imagination and religious faith-perhaps triggered by a sudden flash of insight, perhaps accumulated slowly over the course of centuries. This leap of faith and imagination, which we have called "poetization of the referent," brings about an invisible metamorphosis of phenomena, beings, and objects. The poetiza- tion of the referent thus derives, not from the text itself, but rather from an entire substratum that has evolved through the centuries in the popular imagination. As Genevieve Calame-Griaule has written on the basis of her experience with the Dogon: In the world that was created in this way, everything is a "sign" and nothing is arbitrary; that is, every particle of matter contains a message addressed to man. Human creativity is situated in a universe which reflects its own image and all of whose elements relate to a certain vision that it has of itself and of its problems. Dogon culture is actually a "humanism." Man seeks his reflection in all the mir- rors of an anthropomorphic universe whose every blade of grass, every gnat is the bearer of a "word." (158) As Calame-Griaule explains, the Dogon refer to this "word" as [aduno-s3] "word of the world" or "symbol"). This conception of the "word" is shared by Engelbert Mveng, who defines poetry as the great cosmic celebration of man: the humanizing of nature or man's attempt to integrate his own destiny into creation (133). What the Dogon call "word of the world" is undoubtedly what the Akye refer to as agnanda ("secret word" or "new word"), for it is the word of origins. The "poetic use of the referent," or the "poetization of the referent," is thus a distinctive feature of African poetic expression-a feature that transcends the level of simple meta- phor, one of the fundamental concepts in Jakobson's theory. Indeed, the "poetiza- tion of the referent" would seem to call into question the claim that Jakobson's theory is universally applicable. Another characteristic of Akye poetic speech resides in the power of the word to open itself, to open up other universes, to summon other discourses. A basic prin- ciple of modem structuralist theories assumes that no word can "say" anything except in relation to other words in a spoken sequence; however, the agnanda-nou does not convey its meaning in relation to the narrative instance that apparently motivates it. It nearly always obliges us to consult the history of word-referents. Otherwise, we would only have access to an infinitesimal fraction of the poet's truth, often an insignificant fraction that denies the quality of the "deep word" in the agnanda. One might protest by pointing out that polysemy is a distinctive fea- ture of every genuinely poetic use of language, but it is not merely a question of poly- semy. The addition of an epigraph such as the following one (a more or less parodied version of the first words of Kaydara; see Ba and Kesteloot) does not suffice to resolve the problem:</page><page sequence="6">114 I Research in African Literatures [taalol, taalaangol, taalte yalla a soobote na ? wonande fede baddi pijooji e leeleeje, taalol am yo janta kaawniido. si taw dum motta haabu'en wakkati jemmaaji juudi tuma jaange catti, taasol am yo janta wela nande. so taw dum nyaada-waare' en tekki-da-teppe, taalol am yo kuneungu mbiir- niindi. ndeeno-de, mi baaytodooto, mi nafoowo, mi jaangi-noowo.' [For the little children who frolic in the moonlight, my word is a fantastic story. For the cotton spinners during the long nights of the rainy season, my word is a delightful pastime. For whiskery chins and rough claws, it is a genuine revelation.] If one recognizes the "depth" that characterizes the African poetic idiom, does one have the right to mutilate it by privileging the ritual of images and rhythms at the expense of its initiatory dimensions? Indeed, the "depth" of the African poetic word resides in its revelatory and heuristic potential. The initial words of Kaydara reveal that this initiatory tale is only complete (i.e., beautiful and deep) because it is a rev- elation, an illumination. African poetic speech has never opposed form and content. The "poetization of the referent" enables a word to move and to instruct us because it opens us to other universes, to other codes; indeed, it is a highly distinctive feature of the agn- anda-nou among the Akye. If researchers and analysts disregard this feature of Afri- can speech, they will be ignoring a complex but rich and enriching universe. Yet the "full word," the "deep word," the "poetic word" of the agnanda-nou is not a discursive practice that lies within reach of everyone. According to numerous recorded testi- monies from the field, it requires a perfect mastery of the language by the speaker; that is, he must be adroit in manipulating words, and he must have a profound knowledge of history. N'go Xavier (a poet who works in the Akye oral tradition) believes that each word of the poet must refer to something. Moreover, the poet defines himself essentially as one who has been initiated into all the sounds of nature- the song of birds, the murmur of streams, the behavior of animals, the nature of trees, etc. In short, the poet is, to borrow a term from Aime Cesaire, a man who is "pregnant with the world." In any case, only the Akye listener who is familiar with the knowledge and experiences to which the poet is alluding will have full access to the agnanda-nou. This access transcends the simple question of language and word-play; it is a func- tion of the "being-in-the-world" of the poet and his people. Discriminations are thus made not only on the level of the poet, but also on the level of the audience, for despite the modesty often displayed by poets, we are convinced that every poet always hopes, however discreetly, for a more or less successful encounter between his audience and his "word." Zadi Zaourou deals with the question of poetic usage of the referent in Africa: The analyst of African speech would go astray if he tried to look up the meaning of a certain word (e.g., any word belonging to the Akye parallel universe) in a French dictionary. In this context, the analyst acknowledges that he feels the need for a dictionary of African symbolism-a dictionary that would certainly be of great use. (544) The compilation of such a dictionary would undoubtedly be a laborious task requir- ing a dedicated effort on the part of the researcher, but it is perfectly feasible within the existing structures of oral literature research in most African countries today, as</page><page sequence="7">Agns Monnet I 115 can be seen in the work of Ouattara Tiona at the Institut d'Histoire, d'Art et d'Ar- cheologie Africaine in Abidjan. In his dictionary of terms relating to the animal kingdom, Tiona concludes: Certain traditions affirm that these animals played a role in the migratory movements of the Senufo and that they form the basis of these peoples' origins. In any case, they occupy an important place in mythological stories of a reli- gious and ideological character, in literary genres such as proverbs and tales, in the lexicon of symbols taught to neophytes in the sacred forest, in art, and in the system of assigning names to people. (19) The following terms appear in Tiona's dictionary: [negenetyge] from [negema] and from [tyge] Tree. It is a misshapen tree that constitutes part of the village landscape. It has thorny branches and tiny leaves. It is the privileged roost of vultures, the most feared of all kinds of trees in the area, because tradition identifies it as the place of village sorcerers. [Gberi](Chameleon). He is one of the five primordial animals; the other four are gunugo (tortoise), guna (hornbill), w6tion (crocodile), and fuo (python). The chameleon is characterized by his hesitant and cautious gait, suggesting the fragility of the earth at the moment of its formation. These definitions corroborate Zadi Zaourou's contention that any scholar of Afri- can speech would go astray if he sought the meaning of such words in a foreign dic- tionary. In light of this observation, it is clearly necessary to distinguish the "poetization of the referent" from metaphorization, which lacks sufficient depth to explain the humanistic functioning of the agnanda-nou. As Zadi Zaourou remarks, "In Black Africa, poetry is more than a metaphoric discourse; it is primarily a sym- bolic discourse" (542). Faced with this reality, we propose that a third axis, the sym- bolic axis, be added to the paradigmatic and syntagmatic axes posited by Jakobson. In conclusion, our examination of Akye culture has convinced us that there is a "beautiful word" that is both "full" and "deep." Stylistic analyses have demon- strated that this "word" has nothing to envy in what modem linguistic theories have labeled poetic speech. Its status as a poetic word is thus uncontestably legitimate. If we have elsewhere demonstrated the poeticity of the agnanda-nou (see Monnet), our purpose here has been to define its specificity. By virtue of its "poetization of the referent," the agnanda-nou-"word of the world," a cosmic word-manifests itself as a complete word that reconciles all elements of creation because it is the word of everything that lives and breathes. This enterprise will of course never attain its goal until a dictionary of Akye word-signs-words that have been clothed and adorned by our oral traditions-has been compiled. translated by Richard E.
