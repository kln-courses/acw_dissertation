<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ponge's Photographic Rhetoric ALLAN STOEKL Light plays a central role in the writings of Francis Ponge; his poetry is inconceivable without it. But light - and its ultimate though problematic source, the sun - is more than just one theme or metaphor among many in Ponge's poetic universe; it is, in fact, the central metaphor around which all others turn. When we have understood light (and its contrary, dark) in Ponge, we will be able to understand the status of Ponge's own writings as objects within his light- and object-filled cosmos: we will understand what the writings describe and, perhaps more importantly, what they cannot describe. Of Ponge's writings, "Le Soleil plac6 en abime" ("The Sun Placed in the Abyss") (1928-1954) is surely the most central-not only because it was elab- orated over a quarter of a century, but because of its subject matter. The sun itself is so central that it is ". . . la condition formelle et indispensable de tout au monde. La condition de tous les autres objets. La condition meme du regard" (". .. the formal and indispensable condition of everything in the world. The condition of all other objects. The very condition of the look") (III, p. 162).1 But if the sun is inescapable, at the same time it cannot be fully observed, because of its blinding,glare; it is thus the least likely object that Ponge could describe in a poem: ". .. [le soleil] repousse le regard, vous le renfonce ta l'int6rieur du corps!" (". .. [the sun] repels the look, it pushes you further into the interior of your body!") (p. 162). Nevertheless it must be admitted that everything we see is the sun; we ourselves are merely parts of it, exiled and "envoyes a une certaine distance pour [le] contempler" ("sent a certain distance away in order to contemplate [it]") (p. 163). All we can do is contemplate the sun, not directly (for that is impossible), but in its surrogates, its metaphors: in all other things. The sun, then, must be, yet cannot be, represented; in the same way, the sun is the origin both of life and death. It allows us to live and die on this planet, keeps us somewhere in a middle zone between freezing and burning, keeps us warm for a while and then lets us - along with all other living things - turn cold. Life is a lukewarm mediocrity, "the degradation of solar energy": "Songez combien plus proche de la mort est la vie, cette ti~deur, que du soleil et de SubStance No 41, 1983 31</page><page sequence="2">32 Allan Stoekl ses milliards de degres centigrades!" ("Imagine how much closer life, so luke- warm, is to death than it is to the sun with its billions of degrees centigrade!") (p. 163). The sun can neither be avoided nor confronted; it is the origin and condition of both life and death, and therefore is neither. This is the "oui et non" of the sun; it is heterogeneous, for that reason, to human understanding or logic to the extent that it embraces contradiction in itself: it is, as a philosopher would say, both A and not-A. It is a logically impossible object: "Le Plus Brillant des objets du monde n'est - de ce fait - NON - n'est pas un objet; c'est un trou, c'est l'abime metaphysique" ("The Most Brilliant of the world's is not - for this reason--NO--is not an object; it is a hole, it is the metaphysical abyss") (p. 162). The sun is not a usable object like all others in the world; it is "sans doute en degi de la Vie et de la Mort" ("doubtless outside of Life and Death") and for that reason it cannot serve as an ultimate grounding for man's mean- ings - as can the Word of God, for example. "Tu (le soleil) es la seule personne (ou chose) au monde qui ne puisse jamais avoir (ou prendre) la parole. Il n'est pas question de te l'offrir" ("You (the sun) are the only person (or thing) in the world that can never have (or take) the floor to speak. It is not a question of offering it to you") (p. 170). A little later, again writing of the sun, Ponge asks: "Mais LUI qu'aurait-il donc a dire? Quelle faiblesse, quel marque 'a avouer ou compenser? Non, il n'a rien ' dire!" ("But what would HE have to say? What weakness, what lack would he have to avow or compensate for? No, he has nothing to say!") (p. 172). The sun, not simply an object or a thing (because it is outside the play of signification), and for that reason not a guarantor of deathless meaning (as it is usually presented) nevertheless lacks a lack ("un manque") precisely because it is so totally removed from the (human) play of substitutions and replacements that constitutes both language and the world. But this creates a certain problem for Ponge. As a perfect, faultless (or lack- less) being, the sun becomes something not only outside the system, but some- thing associated with the success of the system and the happiness of those within it. A moral or ethical meaning is assigned to it. Thus Ponge writes of the "remont&amp;e du soleil," the reappearance of the sun after the winter solstice as something to be celebrated through language: "Recommencer volontairement l'hymne. Prendre d6cid6ment le soleil en bonne part. C'est aussi l1 le pouvoir du langage. Nous en f6liciter, r6jouir. L'en fdliciter" ("To willingly restart the hymn. To take the sun decidedly on its good side. That is also the power of language. To congratulate ourselves, to rejoice. To congratulate it") (p. 166). This honoring of the most important cog in our universe takes on an ethical dimension: "Changer le mal en bien. Les travaux forces en Paradis" ("Change evil into good. Forced labor in Paradise"). Darkness is the lack of the sun, the shadow thrown by each individual on his neighbor: light is joy, shadow is unhappiness, and those who receive more light, and thus block out more light, will be happiest: "Dans la joie, hi6rarchie" (p. 168). Even though Ponge's sun is in itself alogical, a "metaphysical abyss," at the same time by the very fact that it is so removed from the earth, the earth can only see the sun in terrestrial terms--terms of good and evil. Writing on the earth, removed from the sun, can only laud the sun. Since it would seem to</page><page sequence="3">Ponge's Photographic Rhetoric 33 be so removed from the sun, however, the attitude of writing, even after lauding the sun, becomes one of indifference. Writing lauds - and thus represents - a sun whose perfection puts it outside the realm of what can be represented. Thus indifference: "Puis finir dans l'ambiguit6 hautement dedaigneuse, ironique et tonique a la fois" ("Then to end in a highly disdainful ambiguity, ironic and tonic at the same time") (p. 166). This healthy indifference on the part of the "objeu," that is, on the part of a writing that incorporates the "liaisons formtes au niveau des racines et les significations boucl6es a double tour" ("liaisons formed on the level of roots [of words] and meanings locked with a double turn") (p. 156), becomes a simple form of amorality. Once the sun is made whole or is elevated, then, writing is distanced from it and becomes either homage or indifference to the sun and its moral qualities. (Indeed writing must be indifferent to the difference between these alternatives.) But why does Ponge write as he does? The painstaking descriptions of objects, the compacted paragraphs where the etymologies of words and the shapes of letters are crucial for the understanding of the poem - what are the origins of these poem-objects? Is their origin the sun, that most fundamental non-object? If so, how did they derive from it? Is their celebration of the non- anthropomorphic simply a function of indifference? Could their relation to solar light be more fundamental than mere homage or indifference? Could the con- fusion and profusion of the poems (cf. III, p. 155) be more than simply analo- gous to the structure of the sun? In other words, how does the totally hetero- geneous sun exit from its sphere and come to the earth as light? What are the manifestations of this heterogeneous light on earth? "Scvlptvre," a short piece written in 1948 on the sculpture of Germaine Richier, establishes a more fundamental link between light and writing. In this text the sun, as light, comes violently to earth. We are told at the outset that SCVLPTVRE, "ce mot de foudre" ("this word of lightning") (I, p. 76), is only a memory of "la premiere fulguration": lorsque la conscience a la lueur de son propre d6chirement se concut a la fois elle-meme comme un amoncellement de nudes et le monde avec evidence autour d'elle comme un Temple ou une Foret peuplhe de formes blanchies par l'arc dlec- trique qui s'6teignit aussitot ... (when consciousness by the gleam of its own rending conceived itself at the same time as an accumulation of clouds and the world around it like a Temple or a Forest peopled with forms whitened by the electric arc which is soon extinguished ...) (p. 76) This first blast of light, this big bang, is not necessarily a mythical gleam (even more originary than the sun) that starts the universe and is then for- gotten (or celebrated); instead it is a gleam of light of the sundering of con- sciousness itself in the act of conceiving itself as clouds and as landscape of Temple and Forest. "Le mot de foudre SCVLPTVRE" ("The lightning word SCVLPTVRE") is itself created in memory of this brilliant self-conception, by and under the light of a self-rending. Rather than writing of an unattain- able mythic sun and its generation of light, Ponge now imagines an originary</page><page sequence="4">34 Allan Stoekl light as the accompaniment of the impossible self-genesis of consciousness in (or out of) a self-destruction or mutilation ("son propre d6chirement"). The next two paragraphs of "Scvlptvre" go on to demonstrate the relation between writing itself and the sudden gleam of self-recognition/self-destruction sketched out in the first paragraph. It is clear from the second paragraph that it is the lightning itself, the "foudre," that has inscribed the word SCVLPTVRE on the "tables de pierre de la loi" ("the stone tables of the law") (p. 76) or on the "fronton du petit monument logique que je prevois" ("the capstone of the little logical monu- ment that I foresee") (p. 77). The inscription has evidently been suddenly etched on the stone; this lightning-inscription in fact precedes the "Parole," the spoken word, which is then nothing more than the repetitive and degenerating echo of the original rending inscription: "mais la Parole, contrairement a ce que l'on croit, ne se fit entendre qu'aussit8t ensuite comme un craquement inter- minablement r6percut6 depuis lors en proclamations de plus en plus indistinctes et lointaines des INSCRIPTIONS myst6rieuses ..." ("but the word, contrary to what is commonly believed, only makes itself heard soon after as an intermin- ably echoing crackling since then in more and more indistinct and distant procla- mations of mysterious INSCRIPTIONS ...") (p. 76). We can understand now the word SCVLPTVRE and why it is "impro- noncable" (p. 77); the two v's not only reflect the fact that this word is inscribed and not pronounced (its pronunciation is only the degenerating sound of its inscription), but the v's represent both the chiseling and dividing point of the lightning, and the cross-section of the surface of the stone, with its inscription. The next paragraph is a meditation on the fact that the word SCVLPTVRE is an impossible conjunction of the instantaneousness of its inscription and the eternity of its self-presentation on the front of the "monument logique": la sculpture contient dans son principe une contradiction absurde puisqu'elle propose ... d'instituer a la lumiere du jour des formes &amp;ternelles ... tandis que son id6e ... tient d'ailleurs non de l'Fternel mais de l'instant le plus fugitif ... (sculpture contains in its principle an absurd contradiction since it proposes ... to institute in the light of day eternal forms ... whereas its idea ... comes in any case not from the eternal but from the most fugitive instant ...) (p. 77) The inscription is now an impossible union of the instantaneous and its eternal remains. In the process light has changed poles, so to speak: daylight ("la lumie're du jour") is now representative of the stable, clear, and eternal, while night is closest to the ghastly light ("formes blanchies," "le monde blafard du platre" [p. 78]) of the lightning of consciousness/mutilation. The last parenthetical state- ment of this paragraph underscores the point, and finds a "solution" to the "con- tradiction absurde": "(Et peut-8tre en deduirai-je par suite que son 6tat de pr6diliction est la photographie sur fond noir dans un recueil par l'orage rapide- ment feuillet6)" ("(And perhaps as a consequence I will deduce that its predilic- tion is the photograph on a black background in a collection rapidly leafed through by the storm)") (p. 77). The light inscription, the photo-graph, is not</page><page sequence="5">Ponge's Photographic Rhetoric 35 read or viewed in the clear light of day, but instead it is "leafed through" by the storm itself and its lightning-light. The photograph is now severed from the light of day: its "taking" and its "viewing" are now both functions of the light of the night storm, of the consciousness of the rending of consciousness. This does not mean, however, that the inscription is not in some way per- manent, but instead that it is so permanent that it presides over the mutation of human consciousness into other forms. Thus the rending-consciousness as inscription is the awareness of animals and plants that make their home in the ruins of the inscription: "les insectes-branches et les femmes-mantes ont pris corps dans le monde de la balafre, dans le monde blafard du platre ..." ("the insect-branches and the woman-mantises have taken shape in the world of the scar, in the bleached word of plaster ...") (p. 78). The inscription is now so permanent that it has overshot the "daylight" of human consciousness entirely; in the inscription a meeting takes place between man and that which is radi- cally other- namely Things. It is a "chemin dj a parcouru de part et d'autre par l'Homme et par les Choses vers leur prochaine 6treinte" ("a road already followed on one side and the other by Man and by things towards their next embrace") (p. 78), a union that will lead to a "mutation brusque (revolution)." Thus when the storm "leafs" through the collection of photographic inscrip- tions, the "leafing" is a process whereby leaves and branches, along with insects and animals, come to make their home in (and finally impossibly merge with) the inscription, the photograph, the word SCVLPTVRE. At the end of "Scvlptvre" Ponge invokes "la foudre," "la priant imp6rieuse- ment de se reproduire" ("imperiously imploring it to reproduce itself") and demanding that it somehow replace or tear apart ("d6chirer") his own writing, "l'informe 6bauche des paragraphes ci-dessus" ("the unformed sketch of para- graphs above") (p. 79). The very fact that he can invoke lightning in this way is an indication that it is the consciousness of the writer himself that, in the first paragraph of "Scvlptvre," is said to "create" the word as a "memory" ("souvenir") of self-genesis through the mutilation of consciousness. Lightning is invoked to memorialize the rending genesis of a writer's consciousness by rending the language of "Scvlptvre" itself-"pour la d6chirer de son jour blafard" ("to tear it from its pale day") - by somehow radicalizing the writing and inscrib- ing SCVLPTVRE at its base -"pour inscrire sur le socle le mot imprononcable de SCVLPTVRE" ("to inscribe on the base the unpronouncable word SCVLPTVRE"). The violence of the inscription is therefore put at the base of Ponge's text; "Scvlptvre" comes under the sway of SCVLPTVRE, the text itself becomes a photograph of the inscription (itself a commemoration of the rending origin of consciousness). "Scvlptvre" memorializes SCVLPTVRE, SCVLPTVRE memorializes the "original" lightning of consciousness; this regress is itself remi- niscent of the decay of the inscription, its reuse in other contexts (as when various animals or creatures come to inhabit it). Ponge's poetry, as in "Scvlptvre" (and as in the self-referential SCVLPTVRE), is a contradictory conjunction of the lightning bolt (the hetero- geneous sun come to earth) and its perpetual, dead but fecund memorialized</page><page sequence="6">36 Allan Stoekl inscription. "Texte sur l'dlectricit6," a piece written for a French Electrical Industry brochure (1954) (I, pp. 143-182) considers the problem of the rhetori- cal status of this light-writing. After we consider this text and its theory of rhetoric, we will be able to understand why Ponge writes the "objeu" as he does. Ponge has recourse to a figure in order to condemn traditional figures. The "old figures," "ellipses, hyperboles, paraboles," are figures of a Euclidean rhetoric,2 somehow analogous to the rigid and unique parallel lines of Euclid's geometry. Opposed to these old forms, Ponge posits "les nouvelles figures, qui nous permettront de nous confier a la Parole pour parcourir l'espace courbe" ("the new figures, which will allow us to give ourselves over to the Word in order to explore curved space") (p. 163). What Ponge means by "curved space" is perhaps explained a few pages later, when the new rhetoric is conceived in the context of electricity: "... une certaine rh6torique: celle de l'&amp;tincelle jaillissant entre deux poles oppos6s, s6pares par un hiatus dans l'expression. Seule la sup- pression du lien logique permettant l'&amp;clatement de l'6tincelle" ("... a certain rhetoric: that of the spark shooting between two opposite poles, separated by a hiatus in expression. Only the suppression of the logical link permitting the explosion of the spark") (p. 172). Ponge here perhaps betrays the origin of his theory in the surrealist theory of metaphor. The idea, or the figure used to convey it, is still important, but the new rhetoric involves a connection between two elements whose linkage is not logical. This connection is not the famous sewing machine and umbrella, but is instead light: the instantaneous juncture of"figural" and "literal," of"signifier" and "signified," is a spark of light, a momen- tary and impossible linkup of two things that cannot be put into a useful, coherent system or a dictionary of meanings. If this spark of light itself has any ultimate referent, it is the heterogeneous sun, the photographing sun come to earth that we saw in "Scvlptvre." Thus the new rhetoric involves not codified tropes, but impossible figures that are grounded by an ultimate signified - the sun and its lightning - that precisely cannot guarantee meaning. But as in the case of the photograph or SCVLPTVRE, there is another side to this electrical rhetoric. We must recall that SCVLPTVRE was ultimately inscribed on the front of a "logical [hence useful, we would suppose] monu- ment" (I, p. 77). Here too the electrical burst of light leaves a remainder that becomes a dwelling for creatures: just as the clam leaves behind its shell, which then is taken over by other creatures, so man leaves behind something, which is then taken over by other men or other creatures. In man's case, however, what he leaves behind is an extension of himself that has never been an uncon- scious "natural" outgrowth (like a shell or web), but is instead a fabricated tool or dwelling. He leaves behind something he can always come back to and use; this "diff6rence characteristique" (p. 179), the externalized artificial body part, is in fact linked to man and put to use through the electrical spark, the current that drives appliances. "I1i donnera done toujours la pr6f6rence . ce qu'il peut commander 5 distance, et du geste le plus facile. Eh bien, I'6lectricit6 i cet tgard n'a pas sa pareille, puisque c'est la force qui se transmet le plus vite" ("He will thus prefer what he can command from a distance, and with the</page><page sequence="7">Ponge's Photographic Rhetoric 37 slightest gesture. Electricity in this respect has no equal, since it is the most quickly transmitted force") (p. 179). Electricity allows man the greatest freedom from his tools and dwellings; it therefore does the best job of preventing him from confusing himself with those things, from thinking that he is those things. In the realm of writing, the same thing is true: it is now the non-Euclidean rhetoric, the spark, which links naked (and agraphical) man to the ossified dwell- ings or tools, the hardened shells of inscriptions, that are his language. Electricity and non-Euclidean rhetoric as forces join things together and at the same time keep them separate. Tools, dwellings, and language are always different from man. The recognition of this difference, in addition to the force of operation at a distance, is what separates man from the animals. What might at first seem a characteristic of the "old" rhetoric -the linkage of man to his useful language and tools, by which he defines himself- is in fact a function of the alogical figuration of the spark. The tools in themselves might be logical, but when they are seen as different from man they are no longer anthropomorphic; instead they are simple residues that could be used or taken over by any beings. The spark of the new rhetoric jumps when man recognizes that he is not his tools, that he is not his logic or writing, that, since he is dependent on his tools or his writing, that he himself is not anthropo- morphic. The short-circuiting of a rhetoric or language that is taken for granted as an integral part of man is the same as the short-circuiting of a self-conception of man whereby his tools or dwellings are simply himself. The lightning of the new rhetoric is a realization that man's words are separate and dead as soon as they have been generated (in lightning). We are back to lightning-generated SCVLPTVRE, which, when read by the light of lightning, is an inscription so different from man that it has come to be the dwelling place of non-human creatures. This is all ultimately about Ponge's own writing, of course. The middle ground of writing, the supposed naturalness, appropriateness, logic, useful- ness, and permanence of signification (in rhetoric, in denotation) is done away with: on the one hand we have the spark of meaning or figuration that is momentary, ephemeral, a shock; on the other we have a permanence of sig- nification that is so exaggerated that it has become a petrified tomb of lan- guage, a shell that, taken over by other creatures, refers to its artificiality and its difference from man. (Both the spark of inscription and the ossification of the tool - or text - are functions of duality: the spark is the momentary union of different and irreconcilable elements, whereas the ossification is the remainder of that spark, which may be useful but which is ultimately recognized as different from man.) Between the extremes of spark and ossification, joining them in their radical difference, is, as we learn in "Texte sur l'6lectricit6," the spark of light of the new rhetoric, of the new process of reading-and writing. Ponge admires writers like Malherbe and Mallarm6 "parce que leur monu- ment est fait de la vfritable s6cr6tion commune du mollusque homme" ("because their monument is made of the true common secretion of mollusk man") (Ppdc, "Notes pour une coquillage," p. 77). These authors as well see language in their poems as a stratification of dead layers of meaning to be mined in the dictionary,</page><page sequence="8">38 Allan Stoekl the shells of meaning thrown off by centuries of human life. The poem itself becomes a "Louvre de lecture" ("Louvre of reading"), a word box or gallery that is as much an object as the objects-man-made or natural-that it describes. In a way, the question of the status of the externality of the world and of the objects described in Ponge's poems is pointless, because the middle ground of language where internal human word describes external natural object has been destroyed in a blast of light. The de-anthropomorphicized objects that Ponge describes are figures for the residue-text as object. All that remains is the gleam of the rhetoric of curved space (where birth and death of meaning impossibly join) and the remains of a language that soon will be inhabited or read by the nonhuman, and then will slowly erode - like shells - when all life is gone: O Louvre de lecture, qui pourra etre habite, apres la fin de la race peut-&amp;tre par d'autres hotes, quelques singes par exemple, ou quelque oiseau ... Et puis, apre's la fin de tout le re'gne animal, l'air et le sable en petits grains lentement y p6netrent, cependant que sur le sol il luit encore et s'6rode, et va brillamment se d6sagr6ger ... (O Louvre of reading, which can be inhabited, after the end of the race perhaps by other guests, some monkeys for example, or some bird ... And then, after the end of the reign of the animals, air and sand in little grains slowly penetrate it, while on the ground it still gleams and erodes, and bril- liantly goes to decompose ...) ("Notes pour un coquillage," p. 77) Under the brilliant sun, the text slowly decomposes... The text as Pongian object, the "objeu," the text as non-Euclidean rhetoric, displaces the text as predictable (and denotative) useful object, as political dia- tribe, as sentimental collection of traditional tropes. Il y a le monde des objets et des hommes, qui pour la plupart, eux aussi, sont muets. Parce qu'ils remuent le vieux pot, mais ils ne disent rien. Ils ne disent que les lieux communs. (There is the world of objects and of men, who for the most part themselves are mute. Because they stir the old pot, but they say nothing. They only say common- places.) ("La Pratique de la litt6rature," II, p. 276) Men think that language is a natural part of themselves and that it can be used to meaningfully change things in the world. Ponge on the other hand holds that man is enslaved to a certain type of language - or rhetoric - and that if a revolution is to take place, it must first be a revolution in the realm of rhetoric itself. Men must conceive a new relation to themselves, by conceiving a new relation to their words. Thus, to the consternation of his friends, Ponge was an active Communist for many years, but he never wrote political tracts or poems. For Ponge, writing has to reach a point where it is no longer naive as to its origins in a process of inscription that is alien to any guarantee of transcendental reference (be it the sun, God, self-reflexive consciousness, or what-</page><page sequence="9">Ponge's Photographic Rhetoric 39 ever), before it can attempt to consider how "external" objects could be repre- sented: "... il faut que [le texte] atteigne, lui, a la r6alit6 dans son propre monde, dans le monde des textes, qu'il ait une r6alit6 dans le monde des textes" ("... it is necessary that [the text] reach the reality in its own world, in the world of texts, that it have a reality in the world of texts") (II, p. 276). The curved space of rhetoric turns on itself, eternally returning to the blind- ing flash of the initial inscription because the only way this inscription sur- vives and is reproduced is through its betrayal, its ossification as crumbling ruin. The momentary flash of light can only be represented by its double and betrayer, the dead inscription. Nietzsche's positions towards rhetoric and language can be seen in Ponge's position; Nietzsche's 1873 essay "On Truth and Lies in an Extramoral Sense"3 puts forward the idea that all language is essentially a lie, because no two referents are strictly speaking identical. Thus we lie when we call two different leaves "leaves"; we ignore some (different) characteristics, and focus on others that are the same. We notice traits held in common only because it is useful to do so. Language is made possible only by what Nietzsche calls a "residue of metaphor" (p. 85), the dead, "bony" remainder of a metaphor, that is, of a word that was initially unique and referred only to a single referent. The momentary, unique (and hence impossible) conjunction of two different ele- ments (what Nietzsche calls "metaphor") is codified and petrified by language and that perfection of useful language, science. Thus Nietzsche can write of science as an "edifice of concepts" that is finally a "columbarium" (p. 85) -a structure that houses dead metaphors, metaphors removed or abstracted from their original and stunningly unique - but not necessarily useful, logical, or anthropomorphic - significations. Only by forgetting this primitive world of metaphor can one live with any repose, security, and consistency: only by means of the petrification and coagulation of a mass of images which originally streamed from the primal faculty of human imagination like a fiery liquid, only in the invincible faith that this sun, this window, this table is a truth in itself ... does man live with any repose, security, and con- sistency. (p. 86) This brilliant "fiery liquid," and this sun, as well as all other objects, are tamed and become useful. Here Ponge goes further than Nietzsche: he pushes the dead anthropomorphic object so far in the direction of death that it is no longer even anthropomorphic; nonhuman beings come to inhabit language or writing, and in the process the ecstatic danger of the "original" metaphor (or inscription) is reinscribed. In a graphic way in Ponge, then, and in a graphi- cally dead text, there is a demonstration of what Nietzsche's language can only state: dead useful writing becomes "aware" of its own death and returns to rep- resent (while necessarily more dead) not life, but a light that is an impossible momentary blast of inhuman consciousness, an originary different (and self- differentiating) metaphor. That originary metaphor (as we know from Ponge) is the sun, but not a useful sun that can serve as a stable grounding for meaning, morality, or even</page><page sequence="10">40 Allan Stoekl indifference. Jacques Derrida has analyzed, in his "Mythologie blanche,"4 the sun as the ultimate metaphor in western philosophy. Derrida argues that there are finally two suns: the stable sun of knowledge is mimed and subverted by a sun that is its written "constructed destruction" (p. 50). The sun is double and turns like any trope; its visible face - the face that guarantees the vision of all things - is also the blindness of vision and the night of logic. According to Derrida, this curved trajectory of the sun is accompanied by a curved move- ment of rhetoric; stable metaphor, the clear distinction between figurative and literal levels of meaning, is mimed by a rhetoric whose most basic trope is catachresis - a problematical figure through which no clear and stable literal level of meaning can be isolated (pp. 38-41). The sun (and its light) is, in Ponge, such a catachretic metaphor; the sun is also the metaphor in Ponge. The very subject matter of Ponge - his objects - as well as his written matter - his object texts ("objeux")- are, as we have seen, the petrified residue of the intervention of light. This light is therefore the ulti- mate referent in Ponge; at the same time, the sun's light (and its earthbound double, illuminated electrical force) is the sign of a rhetoric that is not "natural," that cannot guarantee the "truthful" parallel (Euclidean) conjunctions and adequations of figurative and literal levels of meaning. For this reason, any reading that attempts to account for the strata of meaning in the descriptions of Ponge's objects, his shells and oysters and oranges, or that would ground the meaning of these descriptions in extra-textual "hypograms,"5 must come to terms with the catachretic sun under which Ponge's objects are photographed.
