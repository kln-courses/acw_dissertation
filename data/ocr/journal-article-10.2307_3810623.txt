<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Feminist Critique of Reason Revisited HERTA NAGL-DOCEKAL In this essay I distinguish four different modes of feminist critique of reason. Discussing the work of authors such as Keller, Irigaray, and Butler, I point out that the issue of masculine connotations has been addressed with regard to different con- cepts-or at least different aspects-of reason. In view of a tendency to overdraw the objections, I suggest to reformulate the feminist critique of reason. I also argue that a rediscovery of those philosophical concepts of reason that do not restrict this term to instrumental rationality might be useful for this purpose. The point of departure for a feminist critique of reason is that the concept of reason, in its everyday sense, has connotations of masculinity. The tradi- tional image of gender difference characteristic of Western culture ascribes reason to men and emotion to women. We see this expressed in the way ab- stract thought, objective judgment, and an orientation to general principles are seen as masculine character traits, while subjectivity, spontaneity, and an orientation to the concrete and particular are seen as typically feminine char- acter traits. What this means for women, among other things, is that their faculty of reason is questioned-as witnessed by the familiar jokes about "women's logic." It also means that the cultivation of their rationality is con- sidered "unfeminine"-a reproach expressed in pejorative terms such as "blue stocking." The masculinization of reason has already been diagnosed by Georg Simmel: "Artistic claims, ... the soundness of practical judgment and the objectivity of theoretical knowledge ... all these categories are, in fact, gener- ally human, according both to their form and demands; but in their actual historical manifestation they are thoroughly masculine. Let us simply name such ideas which appear as absolutes 'the objective,' such that in the history of our kind, the following equation can be said to hold: objective=masculine" (Simmel 1985, 200). Hypatia vol. 14, no. 1 (Winter 1999) ? by Herta Nagl-Docekal</page><page sequence="2">Hypatia Further, it is important to note that the "polarization of gender charac- ters"(Hausen 1976, 363)1 did not create a symmetrical, complementary type of order-as its defenders like to maintain-but one that is marked by a pat- tern of hierarchy. Insofar as the relationship between reason and emotion is represented as one of subordination, the traits of masculinity will be estimated superior to those of femininity. This means that the concept of reason, in its everyday sense, carries with it a claim of patriarchal power. The feminist critique of reason sets itself the task to investigate the roots of this connection between reason and masculinity, and to develop alternative ways of thinking. Widely divergent approaches to this task have been for- mulated-the feminist critique of reason does not form an internally consis- tent body of argumentation. One cause of this heterogeneity seems to lie in the way individual scholars define "reason" differently. The following study intends to elucidate this diversity: I will show that the problem of masculin- ization has been attributed to different concepts-or at least different aspects -of reason. I will not provide here a comprehensive typology of feminist cri- tiques of reason. Rather, I have selected a few texts that have gained paradig- matic relevance as their central theses have been met with consent and adopted by a great number of authors. To concentrate on a small sample of texts will make it possible to scrutinize the inner structure of the arguments they formu- late more closely. Thus, the main body of this paper consists of four sections devoted to four modes of feminist critique, each targeting a different concept -or aspect-of reason.2 (By adopting this method, I hope to encourage oth- ers to deal with further texts in a similar manner). First, I focus on the thesis that scientific rationality is based upon the notorious male claim to domi- nance over women (Keller). Next, I center on the psychoanalytically informed critique according to which scientific rationality has its roots in the aggressive separation from the mother that typically characterizes the male child's devel- opment (Keller, Bordo). Third, I deal with a more encompassing form of cri- tique that is not only directed against scientific rationality, but whose diagnosis of "Phallogocentrism" concerns the occidental "Logos" in general (Irigaray). Finally, I analyze feminist objections against conceptions of "practical rea- son," in particular the claim that such conceptions always defend an "instru- mental subject" and promote the suppression of heterogeneity (Butler). One of my points in rereading these arguments will be to advocate a care- ful evaluation: while the analyzed texts do indeed succeed in raising our aware- ness with regard to masculine connotations of common notions of reason, each of the texts also tends to overdraw objections. In the last section of this paper, I therefore suggest to reformulate the feminist critique of reason in a way that avoids this dangerous tendency. I shall delineate four issues whose discussion I consider a basic requirement for any feminist critique of reason. Specifically, I will plead for a rediscovery of those philosophical concepts that do not restrict "reason" to instrumental rationality. I have in mind broader 50</page><page sequence="3">Herta Nagl-Docekal definitions of the term "reason," as provided by authors such as Kant and Hegel, that also include our faculty for making judgments in the spheres of morality and law, and that do not limit our theoretical faculty to the principles of iden- tity and noncontradiction. In view of these more complex conceptions, it may well become obvious, I think, that the feminist reservations that hitherto have been voiced do not provide sufficient grounds for dismissing "reason" toto genere. In this context, it also seems necessary to reflect that feminist theory itself has, in certain ways, appealed to reason all along. BACON'S METAPHOR One variety of feminist critique sees scientific rationality as a form of thought expressing male domination. Many scholars regard Francis Bacon as the fa- ther of this tradition. Bacon views the relationship between science and Nature as one of domination and, in illustrating it, makes use of gendered metaphors: Nature should be subordinate to research and to its attendant technology, just as the wife to the husband. In Bacon's work Temporis Partus Masculus [The Male Birth of Time], an elder scientist, addressing his son, is discussing mar- riage: "My dear, dear boy, what I plan for you is to unite you with things them- selves in a chaste, holy and legal wedlock" (Bacon 1952, 201). He then explains how he conceives of the inner structure of this relationship: "I have come in very truth leading to you Nature with all her children to bind her to your service and make her your slave" (1952, 197). Evelyn Fox Keller generally chooses to interpret Bacon's writings regarding the theory of science in light of these patriarchal metaphors-even where there is no explicit reference to an image of gender hierarchy. As she investi- gates how Bacon describes the way in which science and technology deal with Nature, she claims that, in doing this, she is reconstructing a text about gen- der relations. Thus, Keller explains that Bacon depicts the relationship be- tween scientist, Nature, and God to resemble the family triangle. In her view, we can discern in Bacon a development of the scientist that parallels the ear- ly developmental phases of male children. Object-relations theory provides the categories fundamental to this understanding (see below), and, based on this, Keller traces the following development: the attitude of science appears, at first, to be "receptive" and "submissive"-i.e., feminine. Only later does a "transformation of mind to male from female" take place (Keller 1985, 38- 39). This "hermaphroditic" experience is subsequently denied, and this is the origin of the aggressively masculine standpoint of Bacon's scientist (1985, 40). The result of this development is that the scientist simultaneously embodies both "the appropriation and denial of the feminine" (1985, 41),-and this is what Keller identifies as the core of Bacon's legacy to the present day. One question arising here is whether the kind of transformation process that Keller describes is, in fact, discernible in Bacon's writings, but I cannot 51</page><page sequence="4">Hypatia pursue this matter here. It is more important to question Keller's method. Let us first take a fresh look at Bacon's argument. On the one hand, he maintains that science and technology's relation to Nature is one of domination; and, on the other, he claims that this relation of domination can be described in a metaphorical manner by referring to conjugal relations. Unfortunately, Kel- ler does not clearly distinguish these two elements of his thinking. As a re- sult, her critique fails to address the core problem. From a feminist perspective, it is crucial to focus on the second element and to elucidate the way the hus- band's position is perceived by Bacon, in order to make visible and to criticize the wife's subordination. Such a critique demands that gender relations must be conceived of in such a way that they can no longer be used as a metaphor for hierarchical structures. This is to say that a reading of Bacon's comparison of the "scientist" to the "husband" that is inspired by a genuine feminist con- cern involves a shift of focus: such a reading differs from Keller's approach insofar as the objection to Bacon now relates to only one of the two sides of the comparison he draws: it concerns Bacon's view of the relations between husbands and wives, but not, at the same time, his conception of science and technology's relationship to Nature. The thesis that human beings dominate Nature can just as well be formu- lated without allusion to gender relations. If it turns out that this thesis itself is in need of critical discussion-for instance in reference to today's environ- mental crisis-then we are dealing with a specific problem. We cannot con- demn the human domination of Nature simply by underscoring that women's subordination is unacceptable. In other words, the demand for women's lib- eration does not make it necessary, by the same token, to give up structures of subordination presumed to be found in any other area of reality. Though Keller's claim to discern explicitly patriarchal thoughts in Bacon's work is doubtlessly justified, her critique loses plausibility as she considers the detected patriar- chal traits a sufficient reason for charging Bacon's entire conception of sci- ence to be marked by a masculine bias. That Keller fails to take issue, in detail, with Bacon's use of gendered comparisons adds an, no doubt, unintended ele- ment to her thought: the wholesale objection she raises presupposes that she, instead of articulating a repudiation, tacitly adopts this very alignment of sci- entific rationality with maleness. Very likely, some readers will dispute this manner of problematizing Keller's point of view. They may wish to stress that her focus is the symbolic mascu- linity of scientific rationality rather than explicit forms of misogyny. In this context, reference could be made to Genevieve Lloyd's notion of "metaphor" as stated in the second edition of her book The Man of Reason. "The meta- phor of maleness," she writes, "is deeply embedded in philosophical articula- tions of ideas and ideals of reason" (Lloyd 1993, VIII). Closer inspection reveals, however, that to make this point does not necessarily contradict my line of argument. I also think that it is the symbolic masculinity of reason that con- 52</page><page sequence="5">Herta Nagl-Docekal stitutes the central issue here. But metaphors do not come out of the blue. Therefore, I consider it necessary, from a feminist point of view, to seek to trace the formation process of gendered conceptions. The analysis of Bacon's method I suggested above, highlighting the comparison he draws between "scientist" and "husband," is intended to contribute to this research project.3 Only through such efforts of sorting out the single elements that have been intertwined in the common cliche, it seems, can the basis for defining alterna- tive, unbiased concepts be laid. Lloyd expresses a similar idea of separating strands of thought as she explains that in her book, she had not intended to treat the metaphorical maleness "as part of reason itself, which would have suggested either the irrationality of women or the affirmation of new 'femi- nine' ways of thinking" (1993, IX). THE SCIENTIST: AN AGGRESSIVE SON? In contemporary feminist theory, many authors share the view that the concept of rationality in moder science and technology is, nevertheless, in- separably bound with masculine gender identity. Additional support for this thesis is sought in psychoanalytical theory, and this way of arguing is charac- teristic of the second type of critique of reason I'll investigate. Primarily object-relations theory is used as the conceptual framework in this context-in particular the investigations focusing on the differences be- tween the development of male and female children.4 I will briefly outline the relevant findings concerning the way the ability to perceive reality is gener- ated: At first, the child does not distinguish between the inner and the outer world; the external environment, which for most children in this early stage consists of the mother, is experienced by the child as the extension of itself. Only gradually does the child learn to distinguish the self from the not-self. What is crucial for this process is the separation from the mother: when the mother comes to appear as an independent being, the child experiences the painful recognition of its own autonomous existence. At first, ambivalent feel- ings arise from this experience: there is, on the one hand, a drive to reinstate the original unity and, on the other, a desire for autonomy. The complex pro- cess of development that is thereby set into motion ultimately leads to the child's acknowledgement of a world external to, and independent from, itself. The child then sees itself confronted with objects, and a self-consciousness begins to take shape-one established in opposition to the mother. Yet the child still does not reach the mature stage. Maturity is rather a matter of learn- ing that the separation can be overcome without a return to an earlier stage: "Out of this recognition and acceptance of one's aloneness in the world, it becomes possible to transcend one's isolation, to truly love another" (Keller 1985, 82). Generally speaking, this pattern of development is valid for all children: 53</page><page sequence="6">Hypatia boys and girls both must lear to distinguish between the self and the other. Nonetheless, differences begin to take shape, partly because boys must un- dergo double disidentification from the mother:5 first for the construction of a self-identity and then for the consolidation of a masculine gender identity. Boys therefore tend toward an excessive detachment, resulting in distant be- havior, autonomy, and objectivism-all characteristics generally taken to be masculine. On the other hand, a girl's ongoing identification with the mother hinders to a certain extent the development of a sense of separation. Accord- ingly, closeness, dependancy, and subjectivity are taken to be typically femi- nine characteristics. In feminist theory, this differentiation between male and female character- istics is brought to bear in the interpretation of science. For Evelyn Fox Keller, a continuity exists between a boy's aggressive separation and a science defined by confrontation between subject and object: "A science that advertises itself by the promise of a cool and objective remove from the object of study selects for those individuals for whom such a promise provides emotional comfort" (1985, 124).6 According to her, the same applies to the power aspect of sci- ence; consequently, "the dream of domination over Nature, shared by so many scientists, echoes the dream that the stereotypic son hopes to realize by iden- tifying with the authority of his father" (1985, 124-25). This is the very point of Keller's understanding of science. She characterizes the deficiency of sci- ence in the following way: "But such dreams are by their very nature self-lim- iting. They prevent the son from ever getting to know the real mother. And so, it could be argued, they similarly obstruct the scientist's efforts to know the 'real' Nature" (1985, 125). Before I discuss Keller's critique I would like to stress that my reservations do not concern object-relations theory as such. Rather, in my view, its con- ceptual core, as well as its findings with regard to the development of gender difference, provide valuable analytical tools (although in what follows I must do without a more thorough investigation). With regard to the family struc- ture characteristic of Western culture, the thesis that the socialization of male and female children proceeds differently seems just as plausible as the theory that these different trajectories each tend to lead toward gender-specific deficiency in maturity. The problem that needs to be addressed here rather lies in the way Keller describes the aggressive detachment of the son. In this context, she uses the word "object" in a broad sense: the term refers not only to the world of things, but also to the mother. I will show that this subsumption of "woman" to the concept of "object" is what leads Keller astray. Keller's criticism of excessive separation is certainly justified. It is espe- cially important, from a feminist point of view, to demand that relations among people should take shape in such a way that women are not degraded to object status. (When this demand is discussed in theoretical terms, it usually fore- grounds a concept of mutual recognition. Keller, however, speaks of "love," to 54</page><page sequence="7">Herta Nagl-Docekal which I shall return later.) But a problem arises as Keller rejects not only the object status of women, but object status as a rule. Obviously, she conceives of women's emancipation only in terms of dissolving the confrontation of sub- ject and object in general. The problem here is that she does not dispute the equation of "woman" with the world of objects but instead adopts this equa- tion as a premise herself. Keller's understanding of science is burdened with this problem, as can be seen in the way she seeks to prove the masculine character of moder science's concept of rationality. As illustrated by the previous quotes, she argues that Nature is oppressed in two ways: on the one hand, insofar as it is the object of knowledge and, on the other, insofar as it is dominated. Supposing this description of Nature's oppression is correct, the decisive question still re- mains unanswered: Why should this statement be taken to imply necessarily that modem science is based upon a subordination of woman? Evidence for a male claim to supremacy can only be found here on the condition that "wom- an" has already been identified with Nature. Yet this equation is by no means compelling. On the contrary, it must be challenged, especially from a feminist perspective. The reason this problematic implication of Keller's argument has hardly been addressed until now may be that some of the motives behind her critique of science as such are legitimate. It is, in fact, necessary to reject an epistemol- ogy that hinges on a naive confrontation between subject and object. Like- wise, the scientism of moder research is in need of critical investigation from the point of view that it introduces into the realm of the humanities a way of looking at people that supports sociotechnological kinds of action. But what is problematic here is not that science has connotations of masculinity; rather, the problems are with the specific concepts of subject/object relationship and of scientism that call for a more sophisticated theory. Further, we must con- sider that both these issues have already led to very complex debates that are in the center of the contemporary theory of science and the humanities. Keller's work, however, tends to oversimplify. A couple of examples must suffice here. Where Keller denounces domination in general, a wide range of distinctions is necessary-say, between the justifiably criticized disenfranchisement of hu- man beings on the one hand and, on the other hand, a use of natural resources that is necessary for human survival. Also, considering the world's current ecological crisis, a wholesale dismissal of thoughts about human control over Nature is not advisable. Rather, in this case, it is necessary to distinguish be- tween irreversible destruction of natural resources and the kind of use that leaves intact the resources' regenerative potential. Keller's premises also do not give her the means to address the differences between the natural and the social sciences. Based on her subsumption of woman to Nature, she claims that the scientist's attitude should be inspired by the model of empathy-of love, in fact-between subjects. Thus, she endorses 55</page><page sequence="8">Hypatia June Goodfield's point of view: "If you really want to understand about a tu- mour, you've got to be a tumour" (1981, 63). Goodfield also stands for the view that, in the practice of scientific research, "the best analogy is always love" (1981, 213), a view Keller endorses, too.7 Now it appears dubious whether the concept of love is appropriate at all as a category in theory of science, but it could still be interpreted in terms of the hermeneutic understanding of the social sciences. However, the vague use of the concept when applied to sci- ence in general makes Keller's suggestions for a renewal of the natural sci- ences sound almost animistic. The topic of "animism" is addressed also by Val Plumwood, but in a two- fold manner. While she is criticizing "an anthropomorphic 'respiritualisation' of nature," Plumwood endows the term "animism" with some positive con- notations (1993, 136). Her general aim is certainly plausible: rejecting a mere- ly mechanistic model of nature, she pleads for a more complex conception. Yet the way she seeks to achieve this goal is problematic. Plumwood suggests to reintroduce the concept of "intentionality," which, she hopes, will allow us to discover that "mindlike qualities are spread throughout nature" (1993, 134), and to understand human difference "against an overall background of kinship, forming a web of continuity and difference" (1993, 134). It is in this context that she notes: "There are many ways to readmit intentionality ..., and some forms of animism are ways of stressing continuity" (1993, 134). But what, exactly, does she have in mind? Plumwood explains: "We already have much of the vocabulary of natural agency: 'That stone doesn't want to come,' says the mason of one that is indeed a being thoroughly embedded in the context and mysterious history of its place" (1993, 136). There are two ways to interpret this statement, both of which lead to difficulties. The first con- fronts us with a self-contradiction: by attributing agency to a stone, Plumwood seems to advocate precisely the "anthropomorphic 'respiritualisation' of na- ture" that she sets out to discard. In other words, interpreted in this manner, her considerations do not provide a way out of the problem just diagnosed with reference to Keller's use of the term "love." The second option is to un- derstand the mason's way of expressing himself as metaphorical. In this case, however, because he would not actually attribute agency to the stone in ques- tion, the thesis of continuity, so crucial for Plumwood's argument, would no longer be evidenced by his words. At this point, I would like to note a further instance of self-contradiction: formulating her claim of continuity, Plumwood addresses readers to whom she attributes the specific competence of theoriz- ing about this continuity. She fails to discuss the faculties that make it pos- sible that "we can distinguish, without ordering as a hierarchy, items within a complex differentiated field in which mind is expressed in a family of related intentional concepts" (1993, 135; emphasis added).8 Returning to Keller and concluding this part of the essay, I would like to make one thing clear: my objections are not intended to deny that, on the 56</page><page sequence="9">Herta Nagl-Docekal whole, scientific rationality and reason in general have connotations of mas- culinity. Rather, my concern is that this phenomenon is unconvincingly ana- lyzed by Keller and must find a more precise explanation (see below). PHALLOGOCENTRISM Another variation of the feminist critique of reason-and one that enjoys a wide appeal-takes on not only scientific rationality, but also occidental culture's way of thinking as a whole, which is characterized by the concept of Logos. "Logos" is seen as thoroughly determined by a patriarchal attitude. This belief fuels the most encompassing form of feminist critique. Once again, psychoanalysis provides the categorical foundations for the critique of reason, the work of Lacan featuring prominently in this case. The writings of Luce Irigaray are characteristic of this kind of feminist cri- tique. She first leads our attention to the fact that Freud does not develop a specific theory of female sexuality, but instead speaks of the woman only in terms of lack-as the theory of penis envy shows. Drawing upon psychoana- lytical categories herself to interpret this fact, Irigaray concludes that Freud's concept of sexuality is based on an anal fantasy. She refers to the way Freud explicitly maintains that the little girl must be seen as a small man, and that the woman appears as a deficient man in his work in general. "Female sexual- ity has always been theorized within masculine parameters.... According to these theorists, woman's erogenous zones are no more than a clitoris-sex, which cannot stand up in comparison with the valued phallic organ; or a hole-enve- lope ... a nonsex organ or a masculine sex organ turned inside out in order to caress itself" (Irigaray 1981, 99). Irigaray goes on to note: "Woman and her pleasure are not mentioned in this conception of the sexual relationship" (1981, 99).9 This remark indirectly expresses already the actual aim of her critical reflections. Irigaray's objection is not that Freud has distorted reality. Rather, she is convinced that Freud's formulations are only the explicit expression of how woman is perceived in occidental culture in general, and that this perception determines the real living conditions and experiences of women. As a result, Irigaray's goal is to overcome negative dependency upon the masculine and to make possible the genuine unfolding and expressivity of the feminine. "As Freud admits, the beginnings of the sexual life of the little girl are so 'obscure,' so 'faded by the years,' that one would have to dig very deep in order to find, behind the traces of this civilization, this history, the vestiges of a more ar- chaic civilization which could give some indication as to what woman's sexu- ality is all about" (1981, 100). A precondition for such a rediscovery is to bring to an end men's monopoly on the power to define. Here is where Irigaray's critique of reason comes in. The fact that woman is discussed only per negationem is not, in her view, specific 57</page><page sequence="10">Hypatia to discourse on sexuality, but rather a consequence of the fundamentally mas- culine character of occidental thought. Similar to Derrida, Irigaray holds that the Logos is phallocentric.10 The following assumption is crucial to this inter- pretation: if thought is modeled on the guiding image of the phallus, then it will strive for "the one of form," for proper name and literal meaning. And Irigaray sees the "logic, which has dominated the West since the Greeks" as concentrated on "this kind of unity" (1981, 101). Accordingly, she charac- terizes Western culture as one that "claims to enumerate everything, cipher everything by units, inventory everything by individualities" (1981, 101). In her argument, three principles guide this unity-oriented thought: "identity with, expressed by property and quantity; non-contradiction, with ambiguity, ambivalence, polyvalence minimized; binary oppositions: nature/reason, ob- ject/subject, matter/energy, inertia/movement" (1987, 74). Irigaray then sketches a counter-image in which the suppressed language corresponds to female sexuality. This language is not oriented to unity or un- ambiguity. Woman is, for Irigaray, "indefinitely other in herself. That is un- doubtedly the reason why she is called temperamental, incomprehensible, perturbed, capricious" (1981, 103). Woman's discourse is "contradictory, words seem a little crazy to the logic of reason, and inaudible for him who listens with ready-made grids, a code prepared in advance.... It is therefore useless to trap women into giving exact definition of what they mean; to make them repeat (themselves) so the meaning will be clear. They are already elsewhere than in this discursive machinery where you claim to take them by surprise. ... If you inquire insistently as to what they are thinking about, they can only reply: nothing. Everything" (1981, 103). Just as she associates the language of unity with the phallus, Irigaray relates ambiguity to the female body. 'A Woman 'touches herself' constantly . . . for her sex is composed of two lips which embrace continually. Thus, within herself she is already two-but not divis- ible into ones-who stimulate each other" (1981, 100). When one attempts to follow the course of Irigaray's thought, one runs into a series of difficulties. What stands out is that her concept of Logos en- compasses three disparate elements. To name the first element: many of the definitions applied to the Logos (see above) lead one to conclude that the concept of rationality Irigaray has in mind is that of moder science-or, more specifically, the claim to exclusivity that is frequently associated with it. This claim is, in fact, where critique is warranted. Those who define reason exclu- sively in terms of scientific rationality must be confronted with the fact that the kind of thought that makes use of methods of quantification, and is ori- ented only to the principle of the excluded middle, does not cover, as a gener- ally valid model, all the ways of thinking we perform in our everyday lives. (Typically, we do not consider our judgments in justice, morality and the aes- thetic as irrational, although these judgments cannot be adequately analyzed 58</page><page sequence="11">Herta Nagl-Docekal by means of the narrow concept of scientific rationality.) But the way in which Irigaray formulates this critique-that is, in pointing to phallocentrism-still needs to be examined. Secondly, Irigaray presupposes that her critique of Logos can be applied to European philosophy in general. However, this view is based upon a serious distortion. The history of European philosophy, taken as a whole, cannot be characterized as being oriented to the empirical science's concept of rational- ity.1' One of European philosophy's central concerns, on the contrary, has been the critique of this concept of rationality's claim to exclusivity. More- over, Irigaray does not acknowledge that the concept of reason in philosophy has known a broader definition, one that has included judgment in the spheres of praxis and aesthetics. The problem here lies not only in Irigaray's reduc- tionist grasp of the history of philosophy, but above all in the theoretical re- percussions that arise from it. Irigaray operates with an opposition between scientific rationality and irrationality, and, thereby, is led into the paradoxical situation of allowing the concept of reason she uses to be defined by the very position she rejects. Furthermore, her own thinking is burdened by the fact that she does not pick up on any of the attempts at a broader definition of reason which were made earlier in the history of philosophy. This problem remains to be addressed later. Beyond this, Irigaray applies her critique of Logos to language and thus creates the third disparate element in her conception of Logos. She clearly has in mind Saussure's observation, according to which every definition of a subject by a predicate has the effect of canceling out other options of mean- ing. Irigaray interprets this canceling out as an indication of the sentence's phallocratic character, and she argues that syntax must be overthrown (Irigaray 1985). Regarding this demand it must first be noted, however, that grammar cannot be altered at will; such alteration would be at the cost of intelligibility, and language itself would be abandoned. Here Irigaray ends up in a performative contradiction: her call to overthrow syntax can only be put forward by not being abided. It must further be noted that the alternative language she has in mind amounts to something unthinkable. Without fixity of meaning-with- out any distinction between one word and another-language is impossible. Even the ambivalence-or rather multivalence-to which she aspires presup- poses some fixity; otherwise an oscillation between different images could never be observed. At this point, let's reconsider Irigaray's motives. Her concern is to expose how the roots of patriarchal thought can be traced ever deeper, even into language as such. But her way of proceeding seems to be based on a lack of differentiation. Irigaray does not adequately distinguish between content (for instance, Freud's theories of feminine sexuality) and formal apparatus. She assumes that the contents-the patriarchal conceptions-are generated by 59</page><page sequence="12">Hypatia the logic of science or of language. Characterizing Irigaray's mode of decon- struction, Carolyn Burke also observes: "Irigaray questions the structures of logic in which the female as concept has been suppressed, then displaces the whole system.... She attempts to leave behind the conceptual universe of the Logos and its symbolic policeman, the phallus" (Burke 1994, 45). In pro- viding this characterization, Burke seeks to defend Irigaray's point of view, however. I do not think that this attempt is successful: Burke's defense does not offer a reconstruction from a critical distance but suggests to identify with Irigaray's approach, pleading for a "complicity between reader and writer" (Burke 1994, 51). Consequently, Burke also reproduces the problem discussed here. The lack of differentiation evident in Irigaray's use of the term "Logos" may be found with Burke as well. One example may illustrate this problem: the fact that a neurotic fixation on erection can be observed in psychological contexts does not justify a rejection of any kind of measurement. The core problem with the empirical science's methods of quantification does not lie in the fact that these methods arise from a phallocentric thrust, but rather that they do not offer the means to grasp contexts of human action and aesthetic experience. That Irigaray searches for the origin of misogynist thought at the level of what she calls "Logos" has the consequence that the problem of patriarchy is not closely addressed where it actually arises. What needs to be scrutinized instead of the vague concept of Logos is the power discrepancy between the sexes-the fact that men still have a supremacy in all spheres of life such that they also possess the privilege of definition.12 But shifting the question from the socio-political level to the level of "Lo- gos" also works against the strategy of overcoming patriarchy that Irigaray proposes. Given the premise of Irigaray's Logos concept, there is only one available strategy: to associate women with the counter-concept, that is, the irrational. However, to choose this option means to take on the traditional image of the feminine developed under patriarchal conditions. Scholars fol- lowing Irigaray's lead counter this objection-already frequently raised-by pointing to the difference between the symbolic feminine and the "real" women (Whitford 1988, 119-20). But it needs to be taken into account that Irigaray stresses the irrational with the intention of overcoming the alienation of fe- male sexuality, and thereby of the entire self-understanding of "real" women. Certainly: Irigaray deviates from the traditional cliche in that she revalorizes irrationality. But what does this achieve? Irrationality is both a theoretical and a practical dead end. In theoretical terms, one needs to consider that when dealing with the androcentric underestimation of the feminine (such as found in Freud), a critique can only be convincing, even among women, when expressed in argumentative language. In practical terms, the power discrep- ancy between the sexes, and men's power to define associated with it, cannot 60</page><page sequence="13">Herta Nagl-Docekal be overcome by means of an insistence on ambiguity. It can only be overcome by women having access to equal participation in public discourse, including the academic world, and in the decision-making processes that affect the well- being of the community. What is necessary for a theoretical account of such an involvement is a concept of autonomy; and this would even be a prerequi- site when all that is demanded is a free space for and a recognition of irratio- nality. This means nothing less, however, than that the theories that have been developed in the history of philosophy under the heading of "reason" need to be reconsidered. Do they, after all, contain some elements that allow for a redefinition or transformation that renders them instrumental to current feminist theory? I shall return to this question shortly. It seems possible that yet another motive is guiding Irigaray. It may seem imperative to her, as it has to others, to draw attention to the limitations of scientific rationality in a culture that grants it priority-certainly a justified cause. In this context, it also appears legitimate to vote for ambiguity and ambivalence. Issues of this kind could be discussed, for instance, in a theory of art.13 But the difficulties addressed previously result when ambiguity retains connotations of femininity. THE INSTRUMENTAL SUBJECT Another form of feminist critique of reason concerns the sphere of praxis. It is directed against the attempt to justify actions through universal prin- ciples and, at the same time, against philosophical concepts of a "practical reason" and related theories focusing on the procedure of deciding which nor- mative principles can be universalized. Judith Butler voices this kind of critique with particular intensity. The back- ground for her involvement with these issues is her concern to reject every form of a fixing of gender identity. The formulation and development of a definite identity-regardless of how it is defined-excludes, as she notes, other possible developments. Butler diagnoses a suppression of heterogeneity here. To explain the structure of that suppression, she draws upon the concept of the subject as discussed in contemporary deconstructivist discourse. Accord- ing to this discourse, the term "subject" refers to an identity, the constitution of which requires the rejection of whatever is interpreted as the Other. Clearly, for Butler, "a process of subjection is presupposed in the subjectivating pro- cess" (Butler 1992, 8). Adopting some of the theories I discussed previously, she describes this procedure as follows: "Psychoanalytically, that version of the subject is constituted through a kind of disavowal or through the primary repression of its dependency on the maternal" (1992, 9). Referring to Irigaray, Butler states that this "subject is always already masculine" (1992, 9). With regard to the developing process of the subject, she highlights that, the rejec- 61</page><page sequence="14">Hypatia tion of the maternal being suppressed, the "fantasy of autogenesis" (1992, 9) is able to take shape. One consequence of that fantasy is the pretension that one's "will immediately translates into a deed" (1992, 10). From this perspec- tive, "the instrumental military subject" becomes a paradigm of"subject" toto genere for Butler (1992, 10). On the basis of these considerations, Butler concludes that "to become a subject on this model is surely not a feminist goal" (1992, 9). She is therefore convinced that the feminist concern necessitates a deconstruction of the sub- ject. She also sets out the kind of objective that moves into the foreground when feminism ceases to take its bearings from a fixed image of woman: "if feminism presupposes that 'women' designates an undesignatable field of dif- ferences, one that cannot be totalized or summarized by a descriptive identity category, then the very term becomes a site of permanent openness and resig- nifiability." As Butler comments, this means "to release the term into a future of multiple significations, to emancipate it from the maternal or racialist on- tologies to which it has been restricted, and to give it play as a site where unanticipated meanings might come to bear" (1992, 9). (I shall return to this idea of "play" later.) Butler can be sure of meeting with agreement if she is criticizing behavior that dismisses or instrumentalizes other people. However, a difficulty arises from the fact that she is convinced that the male "instrumental subject" is identical with the philosophical concept of the subject as it evolved at the time of the Enlightenment and as it has been transformed in the twentieth century. Butler stresses repeatedly that her critique of the subject is also di- rected against transcendental philosophy, as well as against transcendental pragmatics and discourse ethics. But these philosophical ideas do not present themselves as being aimed at outlining and authorizing a specific type of iden- tity in an essentialist manner of argumentation. Transcendental philosophy has a more fundamental concern: it inquires which faculties must be taken for granted in order that the emergence of each way of looking at reality and each mode of behavior may be explained. What is at issue in this theory of faculties is our capability of forming concepts, of making judgments, and of making inferences in theoretical and practical matters. As the following analysis is intended to show, Butler's critique of the subject is problematic in two ways: Butler not only reconstructs the philosophical theories that she rejects in a blurred way, but, in doing so, she also deprives herself of a number of theoreti- cal elements that could be of use to a consistent feminist argument. One has to take into account, however, that Butler also dissociates herself from the thesis of the "death of the subject," stating that: "to deconstruct is not to negate or to dismiss, but to call into question and, perhaps most im- portantly, to open up a term, like the subject, to a reusage or redeployment that previously has not been authorized" (Butler 1992, 15). The question now 62</page><page sequence="15">Herta Nagl-Docekal arises: what is Butler's own concept of the subject? Butler places great empha- sis on the fact that social and discursive relations are always a presupposition for us. She interprets this to mean that these relations "precede and condition the formation of the subject" (1992, 12). Following Foucault, she speaks of "those matrices of power and discourse that produce me as a viable 'subject'" (1992, 9). If we now ask how the subject that is created in this way is defined, we come up against an oscillation. On the one hand, the "I" appears as an agency capable of relating to given realities. Using the example of her own analysis of available philosophical positions, Butler explains: "My position is mine to the extent that 'I'--and I do not shirk from the pronoun-replay and resignify the theoretical positions that have constituted me" (1992, 9). In other paragraphs, however, the "shirk- ing from" mentioned here does appear to have taken place after all. Butler's writings also include a series of weaker forms of this "I," eventually approach- ing a zero grade, as I'll point out now. Butler stresses that she is not concerned with a concept of "situatedness." In her view, "it is simply not a strong enough claim to say that the 'I' is situ- ated; the 'I,' this 'I,' is constituted" (1992, 9). In this context the abilities which at first were ascribed to the "I" seem for their part to be derivative, as Butler goes on to say about herself: "Indeed, this 'I' would not be a thinking, speak- ing 'I' if it were not for the very positions that I oppose" (1992, 1). Then how should that opposition be conceived? How can philosophical positions be ex- amined by an agency whose competence to think and speak emerges only secondarily, as a result of that encounter? And anyway, what does that agency consist of? Clearly Butler's reflections lead into a contradiction here-the "I" is simultaneously postulated and denied. That she always places the pronoun in inverted commas even supplies a visual clue to this tension. This progressive dilution of the "I" reaches its lowest point when the pro- noun is described merely as a place. Butler writes, for example: "But it is clearly not the case that 'I' preside over the positions that have constituted me, shuffling through them instrumentally, casting some aside, incorporating oth- ers, although some of my activity may take that form. The 'I' who would select between them is always already constituted by them. The 'I' is the transfer point of that replay" (1992, 9). Here the "I" does not, as in the passage quoted previously, have the competence to replay and resignify spontaneously what is given. It is merely the place where such processes occur. But how do such processes as "replay" and "resignification" come about? Where does discourse get this kind of spontaneity if not from thinking, speaking subjects? It should not remain unnoticed that Butler, in this context, thinks of discourse as of a subject; the structure of self-reflectivity that originally characterized the con- cept of the subject has been transferred to discourse-for example, in the idea that discourse renews itself (Butler 1995, 135). 63</page><page sequence="16">Hypatia This kind of contradiction-the denial of what has been postulated-also comes out with regard to Butler's understanding of practice. On the one hand, Butler advocates "subversive quotations" as a strategy of resistance against oppression; on the other hand, those quotations are consigned to the ano- nymity of discourse: "'Agency' is to be found precisely at such junctures where discourse is renewed. That an 'I' is founded through reciting the anonymous linguistic site of the 'I' (Benveniste) implies that citation is not performed by a subject, but is rather the invocation by which a subject comes into linguistic being" (1995, 135). How can resistance against oppression be explained on the basis of such assumptions? If current discourse does not of itself produce feminist subver- sion, it cannot occur. Seyla Benhabib rightly diagnoses that Butler's reflec- tions ultimately come down to "a doing without the doer" (Benhabib 1991, 140). Benhabib stresses that, if a consistent theory of feminist politics is to be achieved, it is necessary to appropriate elements of the philosophy of the sub- ject as regulative principles. She notes: "The situated and gendered subject is heteronomously determined but still strives toward autonomy. I want to ask how in fact the very project of female emancipation would even be thinkable without such a regulative principle of agency, autonomy, and selfhood" (1991, 140). In Butler's case, however, the risk is that, reduced to a location, the sub- ject will remain an empty stage. Butler's argumentation is ambiguous also where she discusses the practical justification of subversive acts. Butler starts by rejecting all philosophical theo- ries concerned with laying normative foundations for action, referring in par- ticular to transcendental pragmatics and discourse ethics. Her objection claims that every form of universalist moral theory comes down, in the end, to cul- tural imperialism. She writes, for example: "How is it that we might ground a theory or politics in a speech situation or subject position which is 'universal,' when the very category of the universal has only begun to be exposed for its own highly ethnocentric biases?" (Butler 1992, 40). She goes on, in this con- nection, to explain that "to assume from the start a procedural or substantive notion of the universal is of necessity to impose a culturally hegemonic no- tion on the social field. To herald that notion then as the philosophical in- strument that will negotiate between conflicts of power is precisely to safeguard and reproduce a position of hegemonic power by installing it in the meta- political site of ultimate normativity" (1992, 40). Careful reading reveals that Butler confuses two different issues here. On the one hand, she has in mind a phenomenon frequently encountered in the past and present and indeed worthy of criticism-she refers to the kind of pro- cess whereby a particular group of people takes the values that have become obligatory in its own culture, pronounces them universally valid, and prac- tices coercive measures against all those who are committed to different val- ues. On the other hand, Butler sees transcendental pragmatics and discourse 64</page><page sequence="17">Herta Nagl-Docekal ethics as the theoretical expression of this mode of behavior. She does not, however, seek to justify her understanding of these two positions of contem- porary moral philosophy. Butler does not take into account that the claim made by these positions lies in quite the opposite direction, as I shall briefly explain now. There is not, as Butler puts it, "a procedural or substantive notion" (1992, 40); rather, what we have here are two incompatible conceptions of univer- sality. The procedural concept does not amount to a dogmatization of specific values. Quite the contrary-its character is strictly formal. The procedural concept's main point is that only those norms can claim validity that every- one-that is to say, all those affected by a particular action-can in uncon- strained discourse consent to. Butler voices the suspicion that a recourse to a position "that places itself beyond the play of power, and which seeks to estab- lish the metapolitical basis for a negotiation of power relations, is perhaps the most insidious ruse of power. That this position beyond power lays claim to its legitimacy through recourse to a prior and implicitly universal agreement does not in any way circumvent the charge, for what rationalist project will desig- nate in advance what counts as agreement? What form of insidious cultural imperialism here legislates itself under the sign of the universal?" (1992, 39). Butler fails to acknowledge, however, that the consensus framed by discourse theory is not supposed to be justified from an external perspective; whether or not a consensus has been achieved is also something everyone who is involved must agree upon. The reason why Butler disregards this central point of dis- course ethics seems to be that she does not go into the difference between substantive and formal universalism. Rather than discussing that difference, she shares the "affect against the universal" diagnosed and systematically ques- tioned by Axel Honneth as a feature of poststructuralist thought (Honneth 1984, 900). Also, Butler does not take into account the fact that transcenden- tal pragmatics and discourse ethics themselves lead into a critique of ethno- centrism and (not just cultural) imperialism. A further question arises with regard to Butler's own assumptions. As her passages quoted above show, Butler challenges the exclusion and oppression of anyone regarded as different, particularly woman. The thought upon which this critique rests, while not made explicit, must run as follows: no woman may be used as a mere instrument for the purposes of male self-realization; all individuals must be recognized as persons and must also be respected in their differentness. Without the background of some such norm, Butler's critique cannot be understood. At the same time it should be noted that this norm corresponds to the one that Kant regarded as the one formal law of practical reason. After all, one formulation of the categorical imperative is: "Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end" (Kant 1964, 96). 65</page><page sequence="18">Hypatia Butler's reflections thus run into the following problem: the dismissal of the philosophical concept of the subject occurs in an argument that is based on the sorts of ideas that were formulated in the Enlightenment debate about that very concept. (In contemporary discussion, Kant's ethic is often con- strued and criticized to the effect that it demands an abstraction from the dif- ferences of individuals. But that objection is based on a misunderstanding; it confuses Kant's ethic with his liberalist political philosophy. The categorical imperative demands, on the contrary, that individuals should be perceived and supported in their unmistakable distinctiveness.14) A similar problem arises where Butler formulates her political concern. She demands "a social theory committed to democratic contestation within a post-colonial horizon" (1992, 41). How she conceives of that contestation she explains as follows: "Inasmuch as poststructuralism offers a mode of cri- tique that effects this contestation of the foundationalist move, it can be used as a part of such a radical agenda" (1992, 41). However, there is a certain tension between the two statements. By calling the kind of radical program she has in mind "democratic," Butler is formulating a normative foundation, which has a formal-universalist character. Ideally, in a democracy, all citizens have the right to participate in the same way in the process of will formation regarding what laws should be passed in their state. This idea implies that no one may be excluded from this decision-making process because they belong to a particular race, class, ethnic or religious group, or because of their sex. In other words, the contradiction to be found here is this: While rejecting all attempts to ground political action on basic universalist norms, Butler, in plead- ing for democracy, appeals to just this kind of norm herself.15 It is important, however, to see Butler's anti-imperialist and anti-andro- centric impulse in light of her alternative vision of a free development of dif- ferences. Even this ideal, though, is conceivable only on the basis of a formal concept of equality. The free "play" Butler imagines, in which "unanticipated meanings might come to bear" (1992, 9), will in fact be free only if everyone is able to participate in the same way. Incidentally, this tension between explicit critique and the implicit assumption of normative foundations is not unique to Butler; it also characterizes the writings of a number of the authors com- monly classified as postmodern thinkers.'6 For instance, a common current of thinking disregards the fact that the call for plurality and for acknowledgement of differences constitutes a universalist demand. Two different possibilities emerge here, as far as feminist theory is con- cerned. The first is to dispense consistently with any attempts to ground criti- cism of oppression. Each political point of view then appears basically as one among others, and the result is relativism. This means, however, that feminist criticism must abandon its claim to enlighten the general public on the wrongs of patriarchy. The radicalism it aims at in this case vanishes into arbitrariness. As Alison Jaggar rightly complains, such a relativistic attitude ultimately leads 66</page><page sequence="19">Herta Nagl-Docekal to the self-limitation that feminist theory in the end appears binding only to feminists (Jaggar 1990, 162-63). Butler is well aware of the danger of relativ- ism. By adopting the conception of genealogy that Foucault developed from Nietzsche, she seeks to counter that danger in the following terms: "This im- plication of the terms of criticism in the field of power is not the advent of a nihilistic relativism incapable of furnishing norms, but, rather, the very pre- condition of a politically engaged critique" (1992, 39). That declaration of intention is as far as she goes, though. Given her assumptions, Butler is obliged to reject any kind of normative foundation of such a political commitment. Furthermore, the genealogical method has particular problems of its own. As several authors have already pointed out, the proposition that every theory may be traced back to a pretension to power confronts us with a performative self-contradiction. The second option resulting from Butler's vision is the view that feminist criticism, as well as feminist politics, is not possible without normative foun- dations. In this case, feminist theory has to get involved in the debate about justifying norms. But that means it must come to grips with the sorts of ques- tions that have been discussed in the philosophy of the subject, and that are at the center of the contemporary, transformed versions of transcendental phi- losophy, as developed by Apel, Habermas, and Benhabib, for example. ON MASCULINE CHARACTER AND ON REASON IN FEMINIST THEORY As I intended to demonstrate within the previous sections of this essay, an in-depth study of the deliberations typical of the feminist critique of reason leads one to conclude not only that a series of plausible arguments have been brought forth, but also that a tendency to overdrawn objections exists. It is, therefore, necessary to reformulate the critique in a way that avoids this ten- dency. In order to develop a more precise form of analysis, it seems appropri- ate to return to the starting point of the feminist critique of reason once again. What makes us think, in the first place, that feminism calls for a critique of reason? As indicated in the introductory passage of this paper, it is the fact that the concept of reason commonly has masculine connotations. One root of this gendered understanding of the term "reason" is an idea that was intro- duced in the second half of the eighteenth century and has been widely ac- cepted ever since: the idea that men and women have-and are obliged to cultivate-specific types of character.'7 In connection with the division of la- bor between the sexes that emerged in the course of industrialization, each sex has been expected to develop a specific style. Because men were allocated to the public sphere, it has been seen as their ability and also their task to cultivate the use of reason in the spheres of theoretical knowledge as well as practical decision making in politics, justice, and economy. Women, by con- trast, have been denied such competences. With regard to their allocation to 67</page><page sequence="20">Hypatia the domestic realm, they have been expected to represent a counterpart to men's rational orientation. A sentimental ideal of womanliness characterized the bourgeois conception of social order. One telling example is Kant's pre- sumption that women are incapable of letting their actions be guided by the moral law, in other words, by practical reason. "I hardly believe that the fair sex is capable of principles . .. One should not at all demand sacrifices and generous self-restraint. A man must never tell his wife if he risks a part of his fortune on behalf of a friend" (Kant 1965, 81). For the feminist critique of reason, this type of masculinization of reason constitutes the actual scandal, for it confronts us with cliched ways of think- ing and gendered norms still prevalent today. In order to focus on this core problem, feminist critique must proceed in a manner that differs from the ap- proaches discussed above. I do not think, however, that an entirely new mode of critique needs to be created. Rather, I suggest a recombination of feminist research projects that have already been well under way. In my view, the theo- retical elements essential for a more accurate feminist critique of reason have already been provided-are right there, before our eyes, as it were,-albeit not always explicitly related to the issue of the masculinization of reason. In other words, some well-known findings in current feminist theory are valu- able also for redefining the critique of reason. In the remaining part of this essay, I shall outline four issues that I believe no feminist critique of reason should circumvent. It will be immediately evi- dent that, in addressing and discussing these issues, one can draw extensively upon the results of previous feminist research.18 First, no feminist critique of reason should exclude a critique of domina- tion. In this context, the well-known fact that the concept of gender charac- ters has hierarchical implications needs to be addressed. The originally intended symmetry, the presumed complementarity of the sexes, cannot be maintained. Because the sexes are allocated to specific spheres, men hold a dual pre-emi- nence: where women are excluded from the public sphere, the decisions that affect the community as a whole lie in the hands of men only; moreover, the notion of men as the "head of household" also gives them the power to make the decisions relevant to the private sphere.19 In short, as the traditional un- derstanding of the differences between masculine and feminine character re- sults in such asymmetries reason must clearly be criticized as an instrument of male domination.20 This critique must, however, be precise. The objection should be directed against the claim to masculine monopolization on the use of rea- son. To criticize this claim does not, however, as a logical consequence, entail the demand that the concept of reason must itself be rejected. The second element necessary for an accurate feminist critique of reason is that androcentric concepts need to be exposed. As a result of women having been generally prevented from participating in intellectual discourse, the produc- 68</page><page sequence="21">Herta Nagl-Docekal tion of knowledge has in many ways been determined by a viewpoint typical of men. Ensuing conclusions need to be drawn in two directions: With respect to the political dimension of scholarly activity, women must demand equal participation in intellectual life, including academic research and teaching. With respect to the theoretical dimension of scholarly activity, the concept of objectivity must be reevaluated. Already, several authors writing on feminist theory of science have demonstrated that publications in practically every academic discipline, often, while claiming general validity, are marked by male bias. More precisely, it is in many cases the very claim to objectivity that cam- ouflages an androcentric perspective and creates gender blindness. The no- tion of "objectivity" needs to be redefined in a way that demands scholars explicitly reflect upon rather than deny the social norms that guide their think- ing,2' and investigate the justification of those norms.22 With such a renewed definition of objectivity, one task is, of course, to explain the legitimacy of research guided by a feminist point of view. But all this can be done only if women claim to be as capable as men of rational argumentation. The third claim that must not be ignored in any feminist critique of reason is that the notion of masculine and feminine character must be dismissed altogether. According to this notion, human capacities and virtues are distributed among the two sexes. This distribution clearly leads to an impoverishment on both sides. In this context, the correlation between masculinity and reason needs to be more closely examined. Two distinct aspects of this correlation must be distinguished. Reason, when ascribed to men, does not always have to do with men's capacity for judgment in the realms of theory and practice; rather, it often refers to a mode of conduct characterized by distance towards others and the suppression of emotions. This feminist critique of reason is particularly concerned with rendering problematic the construction of an identity wherein strategic rationality is emphasized at the cost of the cultivation of emotions. It elucidates that the masterful gesture produced by this construction consti- tutes the behavioral basis of patriarchal domination. Further reflections are needed, however, as to how much ground this critique may claim to cover. First of all, "reason" is thematized here only in a restricted sense. Where "rea- son" is understood in terms of the detached behavior commonly attributed to men, there is a danger that the realm of reason will be limited to instrumental rationality. As I shall emphasize shortly, such a restricted definition leads to difficulties, not in the least with respect to feminist concerns. To counter this problem, the traditional, broader meaning of reason-whose essential aspects include responsibility and responsiveness-must be brought forth again.23 There is a second, more fundamental difficulty to be noted here. Suppose that the kind of reason that has commonly been attributed to man is defined in a wider sense and not limited to strategic rationality-the division of human capa- bilities among the sexes would still remain problematic. Regardless how the 69</page><page sequence="22">Hypatia respective character images are portrayed in detail, such a division always con- ceives of men and women as halved beings. The alternative that I advocate is to let men and women individually unfold their rational as well as their emo- tional capacities.24 In any case, a critique of reason directed against a style of conduct that is regarded as masculine (at least in Western culture) must be clearly distin- guished from actual philosophical discourse on the concept of reason. Hence, the conceptual pair "reason/emotion" must be approached differently, depend- ing on whether it occurs in a study of behavior or in an inquiry into funda- men-tal philosophical questions. Although it is appropriate to problematize a psychological image of personality built on the severance of emotions, a philo- sophical debate is not eo ipso dubious if it differentiates between reason and sense perception or between duty and inclination. While it may certainly be necessary to question such philosophical differentiations as well, what is rel- evant is the proficiency of such differentiations in elaborating epistemological issues and problems of moral philosophy, not their pertinence to traditionally masculine character traits. Finally, traditional philosophical conceptions of reason must be reanalyzed in feminist critiques of reason. It is important to note a tension that exists within the philosophy of the Enlightenment. The concept of reason was first deter- mined in a sexually neutral manner; it was used to depict the differentia specifica, distinguishing humans from animals. Under the banner of reason, specifically human abilities were elaborated-Kant called them faculties [Vermogen]; of central importance was the competence of making theoretical as well as prac- tical judgments. Only in a second step, in connection with the attempt to construct complementary character-images for the two sexes, did the notori- ous masculinization of reason result. The tension between the sexually-neu- tral and the sex-specific conception of reason also often marks the theories of the feminine. It is, for example, evident in the work of Kant, when he denies women the capacity to act according to principles of reason, yet recommends that they independently make use of their intellect and, thus, rid themselves of their self-proclaimed guardians (Kant 1963). As the texts discussed in this essay illustrate, some authors motivated by feminist concerns seek to expose the tension between the general and the masculine concept of reason as a sham. They maintain that the general con- cept of reason is nothing but a by-product resulting from the endeavor to present masculine conduct as the actual human one and, in this way, secure its dominance. But this generalizing suspicion, as it denigrates the concept of reason toto genere, raises some serious questions. Does it make sense, one will have to ask, for instance, to conceive of a feminist theory that does not rely on any form of reason? As a first step towards a clarification of this issue, I suggest investigating which presuppositions are commonly made-albeit not neces- sarily in an explicit form-in feminist studies. Through such an investigation 70</page><page sequence="23">Herta Nagl-Docekal it becomes clear that, when feminist theory strives to expose androcentric patterns of thought, it carries the assumption that its critique can be formu- lated as an argument, that is, expressed in a manner comprehensible to both men and women. And when feminist theory opposes the subordination of women, it presumes that the critique of domination is not a matter of indi- vidual taste but something that can be made plausible to everybody.25 Consequently, such presuppositions should not be denied if feminist theory is not to end up in a performative self-contradiction. Yet, to explore these presuppositions means to elaborate the very type of questions raised within the parameters of the debate on the concept of reason. This is only to say, however, that the discussion on reason should continue-I do not suggest that any traditional conception of reason be simply adopted. On the contrary, a feminist perspective involves the task of disclosing and repudiating the fre- quent, often tacit transition from an elaboration of the general concept of reason to a theory of masculine character. The central point of the feminist critique of reason lies not in the thesis of the irrevocably masculine character of the rational but in overcoming the traditional masculinization of reason.

NOTES An earlier version of this paper was read at the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies at Harvard University on October 11, 1995. I would like to thank Seyla Benhabib, Hilary Putnam, and all the other participants in the discussion for their helpful comments. Furthermore, I am grateful to those anonymous colleagues who studied this essay on behalf of Hypatia and responded very competently. 1. See also Judith Butler's "Contingent Foundations: Feminism and the Question of 'Postmoderism"' (Butler and Scott 1992, 39). 2. Generally speaking, I am focusing on modes of critique rather than on authors: the work of one individual author may well present a combination of various argu- mentation patterns, as seems to be the case, for example, with Evelyn Fox Keller's writings (see my comments below). 3. Some authors who participated in the recent debate seem to think little of such attempts to analyze metaphors by reconstructing the ways in which distinct thoughts have become associated with one another in the first place. Phyllis Rooney, for example, challenges theories of metaphor-termed "the comparison view"-that focus on the structure of analogy (1991, 86). But her critique fails to be convincing because she does not provide sufficient evidence for the circularity she considers a feature of analogy. (Presumably, the logic of analogy does not account for the forma- tion of every given metaphor. But this is not the issue at stake here.) Further difficulties arise with regard to the alternative Rooney advocates, that is, the concept of "root 71</page><page sequence="24">Hypatia metaphor." Certainly, a kind of metaphor exists that has, as this conception suggests, "become so deeply embedded in our thought that we no longer even recognize it as such" (Rooney 1991, 87). But doesn't this fact render it even more urgent to investi- gate the origins of such forms of rootedness? To reject the option of scrutinizing en- trenched associations carries with it, I think, the danger that metaphor is being mystified rather than analyzed in a critical manner. One inherent problem seems to be over- interpretation, as is illustrated by the way Rooney reads the following passage from Kant's Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals: "To behold virtue in her proper form is nothing else than to exhibit morality stripped of all admixture of sensuous things" (1959, 44). Commenting on this reflection, Rooney notes: "While virtue in its pure form is portrayed as a woman, she is the passive object of male vision, and we see where the voice of power and reason is located" (1991, 84). This interpretation has little to do with Kant's thinking, and is obviously the result of a faulty translation. The German word for "virtue," as regards grammatical gender, is a feminine noun: "die Tugend." Consequently, to talk about "virtue" requires the equivalent for "her": "sie." This explains why the translator mistakenly used the word "her" in the English version of Kant's text. In other words, Kant, in this case, did not draw upon a meta- phor that he might well have chosen not to introduce; he simply used the term "Tugend" in the only grammatically correct way. Of course, grammatical gender is itself a worth- while subject of investigation because it always betrays a background of imagination. But that is a different issue. Obviously, grammatical gender does not prefigure our views in a decisive manner and is not identical with what Rooney would call subcon- sciously held gendered pictures. In the given case, for example, it did not prevent Kant from attributing the faculty of cultivating virtue to men rather than to women (I shall return to this matter below). Neither did the grammatical gender of the term "reason"-which, in the German language, is female as well: "die Verunft"-prevent the word from getting associated with masculinity in the way discussed in this paper. 4. For an example of psychoanalytical studies that focus on the differences be- tween the development of male and female children, see Nancy Chodorow's The Re- production of Mothering: Psychoanalysis and the Sociology of Gender (1978). 5. Keller adopts this concept from R. Greenson's "Disidentifying from Mother: Its Special Importance for the Boy" in Explorations in Psychoanalysis (1978). 6. Susan Bordo reasons along similar lines. In a widely read essay she takes on Descartes' Meditations and concludes that Descartes' concept of knowledge originates in the attempt to compensate for the fear of separation. "I will suggest that we view the 'great Cartesian anxiety,' although manifestly expressed in epistemological terms, as anxiety over separation-from the organic female universe of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Cartesian objectivism, correspondingly, will be explored as a defen- sive response to that separation anxiety, an aggressive intellectual 'flight from the feminine"' (Bordo, 1986, 439-56). Because of the similarity between their arguments, the objections formulated against Keller, in what follows, can also be directed at Bordo. For a critical exchange with Bordo, see also Lorraine Code's, What Can She Know? Feminist Theory and the Construction of Knowledge (1991, 50-54 and 134-37). 7. See Keller (1985, 125). 8. To prevent misunderstanding, I would like to stress once again that I agree with Plumwood's rejection of mechanism. Like her, I think that natural phenomena, 72</page><page sequence="25">Herta Nagl-Docekal such as organic life, call for a more complex account. The problem I wanted to ex- pose, however, is a lack of complexity: having formulated the call for a higher level of differentiation, Plumwood, in my view, moves on too rashly to her assumptions of continuity. Apart from the issue of evidence, the question here is: How should the suggested animistic approach serve the interest of women demanding to be fully re- spected as human beings? 9. See Margaret Whitford's "Luce Irigaray's Critique of Rationality" (1988, 118). 10. For a new interpretation regarding the proximity between Irigaray's and Derrida's thinking, see Ellen T. Armour's "Questions of Proximity: 'Woman's Place' in Derrida and Irigaray," in Hypatia (1997, 63-78). 11. Analyzing how Irigaray reads Heidegger, Ellen Mortensen also charges that her understanding of the term "logos" is too narrow, as "logos... cannot be reduced to a synonym of 'rationality"' (Mortensen 1994, 227). 12. That the deconstructive approach is not very useful for feminist politics is also explained by Nancy Fraser (1992, 177-94). 13. Cornelia Klinger draws attention to the crucial elements shared between a feminist critique of scientific rationality and the Romantics' critique of Enlighten- ment (1992, 29-52). 14. For a detailed investigation of Kant's concept of the categorical imperative see Nagl-Docekal's "Feminist Ethics: How it could benefit from Kant's Moral Philoso- phy" (1997, 101-24). 15. Kate Soper also expresses the charge that postmodernists implicitly appeal to the very values they are rejecting (1989, 91-112). 16. See Herta Nagl-Docekal's "Das heimliche Subjekt Lyotards" (1988, 230-46). 17. As Karin Hausen has shown, in the German language a new term was created to express this idea. The word "Geschlechtscharakter," suggesting the existence of a specifically masculine and a specifically feminine character, came into usage around 1800 (Hausen 1976, 363). 18. Elizabeth Anderson makes a similar attempt of classification in her proposal to sort the given variety of approaches to feminist epistemology into four categories (1995,57-58). 19. From the countless studies analyzing the negative effects on women of the common division of labor between the sexes, I would like to mention at least the following two: Carole Pateman's The Sexual Contract (1988), and Susan Moller Okin's Justice, Gender, and the Family (1989). 20. With reference to the specific issue of feminist epistemology, Naomi Scheman makes precisely this point, as she considers the core concern of "'antimasculinism' by analogy with anti-racism," in "Feminist Epistemology" (1994, 79). 21. Sandra Harding's work is of particular relevance to this project of creating a new concept of "objectivity" (1991). Harding uses the term "strong objectivity" for the reformulated version she advocates and defends in the following manner: "the problem with the conventional conception of objectivity is not that it is too rigorous or too 'objectifying', as some have argued, but that it is not rigorous or objectifying enough ... politically guided research projects have been able to produce less partial and distorted results of research than those supposedly guided by the goal of value- neutrality" (1993, 49-50). 73</page><page sequence="26">74 Hypatia 22. This is the central point of my own attempt to formulate an alternative con- cept of objectivity with regard to the historical sciences (see Nagl-Docekal 1982). For fundamental objections against concepts of "value-free-science" see also Helen E. Longino's "Can There Be a Feminist Science?" (1989, 45-57). 23. Kant's philosophy of practical reason, for example, contains all the essential elements of a theory of care (Nagl-Docekal 1997). 24. Similarly, several authors have demanded in the recent debate that the con- cepts "woman" and "man," understood as categories of social order, should be elimi- nated altogether. See Sally Haslanger, "On Being Objective and Being Objectified" (1993, 85-126). 25. Based upon similar considerations, Martha Nussbaum concludes: "Feminists have an especially great need for reason" (1996, 17-18). REFERENCES Anderson, Elizabeth. 1995.
