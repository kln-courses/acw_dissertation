<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEHAVIORISM, PSYCHOANALYSIS, AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF P-FUNCTION By CARL M. WHITE, Cornell University Subjectivism, regarded as a theory which conceives an inner mental substance and an outer physical substance as partners in a metaphysical dualism, has in recent years fallen into all but universal disrepute; but the consequent readjustment of psychological theory and practice has not yet been completely effected. In the welter of discussion provoked by this circumstance, psychoanalysis and be- haviorism emerge, not necessarily as antithetical, but as extreme positions to the right and left. It now begins to appear that a central position, which should avoid the older metaphysical view and also escape the partialities of the newer extremes, would afford the psy- chology of our times a very great advantage. In his psychology of the P-functions Bentley has attempted such a central position. Let us examine this position and compare it right and left with behaviorism and psychoanalysis. The functional position outlined in Psychologies of 1980 found a partial expression as far back as 1924 in The Field of Psychology. But this treatise, classic though it is in certain methodological features, falters between structuralism, the best elements of which it sought to conserve, and a consistent functionalism. "The Composi- sition of Experience" (Part I of the Field) analyzes 'experience' into the usual 'elements,' sensation, sensimages, and affective qualities; while "The Organization of Experience" attempts, with doubtful success, to regard these constituent 'elements' as they stand integrated. It is, therefore, not until we come to "The Psychosomatic Functions" that we reach the expected functional treatment. Perceiving, remem- bering and imagining, acting and feeling, understanding and thinking, are there described as modes-in-which-the-organism-acts, operates or performs, each mode differing from the others in certain typical aspects which may be observed and described. "Socialization" and "Development of the Psychological Organism" deal with the progressive development of these functions, which are conditioned at any moment of their history by stock, growth, physico-chemical *Accepted for publication January 15, 1931. 263</page><page sequence="2">264 WHITE exchange, association with other organisms, human events, and social traditions. This treatment of the facts of psychology obviously makes the mind (as experientially defined) a co-partner with the physical structures in the psychosome; and it is the functional unity of this psychosome, or mind-body, which lies behind the psychosomatic functions. Here is more than a remnant of structuralism. More than a remnant also of the various functionalisms, cognitive and biological, which have been filling our psychological shelves since Stout and Angell wrote in the '0os. It is to the elimination of these substantively different partners that the author of the Field addresses himself in The Psychologies of 1980. Here the key-note is function. It is function of a psychological sort (P-function, in abbreviation) which supplies all the fundamental material for psychological studies of the living organism. No mental category is employed for supply- ing a mental substrate or 'structure' for the P-functions. There is no longer mind-body or psychosome. There is no longer substantive co6peration. The only 'structures' to be found in the organism are found by the anatomist and the morphologist. These furnish the common ground for all functions, albeit they are to be utterly stript of every materialistic or other philosophical connotation which would tend to prejudge or to limit their functional competency. This departure from the Field involves, as a corollary, a revised view of the natural relations of psychological to biological studies. The new view sets these studies in a functional coordination. The biological functions (B-functions) are of the physiological sort as re- gards the internal economy of the organism and of the adaptive sort as regards the active relation of the organism to its environment. The concept of 'the environment' is handed over to the biologist and quite removed, as a basal term, from the field of the psychologist. Now it should be profitable to compare for likenesses as well as for dissimilarities this revised view of psychology-which makes function basal, distinguishes psychology from the biological sciences, rejects the 'mental' both as content and as cause, and nevertheless preserves all of the usual problems and procedures of psychology-- with that form of behaviorism which has proposed to limit itself to physical, chemical, and biological terms and concepts. We take, for the purposes of our comparison, the writings of Watson. Both Watson and Bentley have agreed that the 'traditional' views of the task of the psychologist are unsatisfactory. For Watson,</page><page sequence="3">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF P-FUNCTION 265 this task is the description and explanation of behavior. With the completion of the behaviorist's program (which cannot, to be sure, be realized until his methods are improved) no really essential problem of introspective psychology will remain unsolved.' On the other hand, to impose upon psychology the task of transliterating behavior into terms of consciousness is, in any event, to proceed by analogy. It would mean that, after the behavior has been described, the conscious content of the animal or human subject would have to be constructed. Obviously, this involves an inference, and since an experimental science has nothing to do with inferences, the analogical procedure is absurd if psychology is to be a science. In the second place, Watson and Bentley are more nearly agreed than might at first sight appear as to what constitutes the subject- matter of psychology. We have seen that that subject-matter con- sists for Bentley in certain distinctive functions of the total organism. The same is, in theory, true of Watson, who objects strenuously to the appellation, "muscle physiologist,"' and declares that "the be- haviorist is interested in the way the whole body works," in "total activities," not in "muscle twitches."3 In this connection, the out- line of his Psychology from the Standpoint of a Behaviorist is illuminat- ing. After the opening chapters, which deal with orientation and methods, the author describes, in the three following chapters, the mechanisms of behavior. If we are to credit his insistence that his program is different from the physiologist's, all of these chapters must be regarded as strictly preliminary. The rest of the book is devoted to a consideration of the functions of the 'whole organism.' Successive chapters treat of hereditary and acquired "modes of response," of the "organism at work" (turning from the acquisition of these modes to their employment by the adult individual), and of "the personality and its disturbance" (considering "how well or how poorly" the individual functions "in his present environment").4 Here we find a difference which is fundamental to an understand- ing of the sense in which either writer may legitimately be referred to as a functionalist. Watson means by 'function' either a mode of operation or a kind of achievement. Thus, when he speaks of function as a way in which the whole organism works, he is using the term in xJ. B.

For Watson, the adaptive signification is primary; but precisely the opposite is true for Bentley, whose P-function always denotes a mode of performance. Once more, a fundamental difference arises over the criterion of objectivity. Watson defines objectivity epistemologically, i.e. on the basis of the traditional dualism of subject and object, of mind and body. By definition, therefore, all things 'mental' are subjective, while that is objective which is 'outside' of the observer in such a way as to be perceptible only to a bystander or onlooker. Thus, at one stroke, psychology is limited to those problems which may be en- visaged from the bystander's system of reference. Bentley, on the other hand, defines objectivity in terms of method. It follows that there is for him no point in categorically denying the possibility of solving any problem that may suggest itself, because the solution will, in any particular instance, depend upon the ingenuity of the investi- gator, who must discover a type of procedure that will enable him to check his results experimentally at each step. A fact is objective, not with reference to a spatial analogy between an inner and an outer, but rather when manipulation of conditions reveals that .(to use a figure) the universe or 'nature,' instead of the experimenter, has spoken thus-and-so. In actual practice, science knows no other form of objectivity than the methodological, a feature that enables the psychologist to test any theoretical issue that may present itself, even the behaviorist's tacit assumption that scientific laws can be formulated concerning only those phenomena which can be observed from the bystander's system of reference. When this deliverance is put to experience in the form of a question, we need go no farther than, say, the third law of color-mixture to ascertain that nature's deliverance does not coincide with the behaviorist's. Another moment enters into the appropriation of the bystander's system of reference. In his early article on "Psychology as the be- haviorist views it," Watson's point of departure is the fact that human psychology has not made good its claim as a natural science. This failure, we are told, is due to a mistaken conception of its subject- matter. It follows that the remedy must come through revising this mistaken conception; and behaviorism prescribes that the traditional subject-matter of psychology shall be conceived in precisely the same way as the sciences of nature (physics, chemistry, and the rest) con-</page><page sequence="5">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF P-FUNCTION 267 ceive theirs. "This suggested elimination of states of consciousness as proper objects of investigation in themselves will remove the barrier from psychology which exists between it and the other sciences. The findings of psychology ... lend themselves to explanation in physico- chemical terms."5 Two questions naturally arise in this connection. First, if it is futile to construe behavior in terms of consciousness, as most psy- chologists would now agree, why is it any less futile to construe it in terms of electrical and chemical processes?6 Obviously, the procedure is based on analogy in one case no less than in the other. The fact is, Watson evidently believes that the final test of scientific respectability, the "true explanation," of any biological or psychological phenomenon requires that its explanation be "couched in physico-chemical terms."Y This brings us to a second question. Does the category of one science provide a more "true," or more nearly "true," explanation than that of another? Perhaps, if we care to give a metaphysical turn to the term 'explanation,' but if we remain on descriptive grounds, an affirmative answer is hardly plausible for the simple reason that the question itself is virtually meaningless. The purpose of the sciences is to describe, each from its own point of view, a common world. Scientific procedure is thus essentially selective, and the very excuse for the existence of more than one science lies in the fact that nature's several dimensions burst the mold of any single descriptive category. This being the case, it is nonsense to discuss degrees of trueness. But apparently Watson is not to be deterred by the warning that questions of truth and reality should be left to metaphysics. A less militant protagonist of the bystander's system of reference would doubtless rest content with the simple declaration that the point of view is adopted and adhered to because it is believed to be the most fruitful approach to the study of psychological subject-matter. But Watson dutifully takes a critic to task for saying that the behaviorist merely ignores, but does not deny, the existence of what traditional psychology called 'mental states.' This is, he reproves, "a serious misunderstanding of the behavioristic position."8 Passages like this plainly indicate that the behaviorist intends to cast his lot profes- sionally with the materialistic metaphysicians. Whether this type of 60p. cit., footnote I. 6Cf. Behaviorism (rev. ed.), 21o. 'Ibid. 8Watson, Is thinking merely the action of language mechanisms? Brit. J. Psychol., II, 192o, 87-104.</page><page sequence="6">268 WHITE Weltanschauung is defensible does not in the least concern us here; but this dabbling in metaphysics sets Watson in sharp contrast with Bentley, who draws a clear line of demarcation between scientific and speculative thought, and carefully consigns the problem of the ultimate nature of truth and reality to the latter. In Psychologies of 1925, Bentley urged that, in preparing to treat scientifically a body of facts, the nature of the facts themselves should receive first consideration. Instead of being thrust into a pre- conceived pigeon-hole, these facts, if they are to be understood, must be described "in such subdivisions or aspects" as their own nature suggests. It is for this reason that Bentley refrains from analyzing the P-functions into 'simples' of any kind; for, if psychologists are, after all, dealing with modes of operation, it is their primary task "to define and to depict" these functional modes as such.9 Just as one may acquire considerable information about the products of a print- ing press, their value, etc., and still be crassly ignorant of the way in which the press works, so we may acquire considerable information about the accomplishment of the organism, the worth of this accom- plishment from the standpoint of environmental adjustment, and the like, and still remain comparatively ignorant of the going-on-to- accomplishment. While, as has been suggested, behavior for Watson may, in a certain broad sense, be equated with the way the whole organism works, behavior, in his hands, nevertheless acquires meanings dis- tinctly foreign to Bentley's P-function. As a preliminary step to- ward pinning down what is signified by the behaviorist's 'behavior,' it is necessary to distinguish at the outset between the behaviorist's faith and the behaviorist's practice. McDougall characterizes Watson as a strict behaviorist who "believes that two very simple conceptions suffice for the explanation of every instance of behavior, namely, the reflex and the conditioned reflex.10 The characterization is apt so far as it goes; but this article of faith is no more important than the belief that the "true explanation" of every instance of behavior must be couched in physico-chemical terms. Watson bases much of his actual procedure upon units of descrip- tion which are 'simples' selected from some ontogenetic or phylo- genetic source. "In order to understand man you have to under- stand the life history of his activities.""1 Tracing the "activity 9M. Bentley, Psychologies of 1930, 1930, 95-114. 10Wm.

"Watson, Psychologies of 1925, 1-35.</page><page sequence="7">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF P-FUNCTION 269 stream" back to its ontogenetic source in the human infant, Watson ends his quest for a 'simple' by adopting the more or less discrete reflex movement as ultimate. Accordingly, the congenital reflexes become the elements out of which all future behavior is compounded; behavior, in this sense, being nothing more nor less than such a com- pound. An interpretation of a world-wide economic situation and the Babinski reflex have fundamentally the same dimension; their only difference is a matter of complexity. The program of psychology differs from that of physiology only in the type of phenomenon re- duced to this lowest common denominator. That program consists in noting movements and in analyzing them into their simple elements. In so far as Watson is faithful to this principle of reduction, it is true that the discrete reflex serves as his basic category. But Watson the psychologist is not satisfied to limit himself to a program so obviously analogous to physiology, and to the extent that he in- troduces non-physiological features, of course, he abandons the dis- crete reflex movement as a category. Thus stimulus and response are both originally defined in physiological terms.U2 But, as he goes on, stimuli are introduced which only by the widest stretch of the imagi- nation are describable in electrical, chemical, thermal and mechanical terms; he frankly expresses his fear that, after all, the reflex is an "over simplication."'13 He even concedes that, in its present state, physi- ology "cannot help us much" in a psychological description of be- havior."4 Obviously, a new and more distinctively psychological category has been introduced, namely, environmental adjustment. That an 'adjustment' and a 'reflex' cite dimensions of experience that cannot easily be resolved into one another, without speaking loosely, will, I think, be disputed by few. Certainly no physiologist could be ex- pected to be enthusiastic over the proposal to state the difference in my reactions to two situations as due to my witnessing a hunter in the one case "shooting squirrels" and in the other case "shooting rabbits."'1 But it is no less evident that Watson slips carelessly from one category to the other. "In this volume," he remarks in Psychology from the Standpoint of a Behaviorist, "the terms ad- justment, response, and reaction are used almost interchangeably."'16 12Vide Standpoint, io-II. 13The fear is, however, suppressed in a parenthesis: Behaviorism (rev. ed.), 1930, 2o6-207.

In the work just mentioned, he indicates that "what we seek to have psychology busy herself with is just this matter of environmental adjustment." The difference between psychology and physiology, in fact, lies precisely at this point; for "nowhere in physiology do we get the organism, as it were, put together again and tested in relation to its environment as a whole."'s In short, the func- tional view of the Chicago School seems to have been embraced from the beginning: "In the main," he announces in 1913,' "my desire ... is to gain an accurate knowledge of adjustments and the stimuli calling them forth."'" This quotation brings us to the last important difference between Watson and Bentley. We may say that Bentley entertains the critical, Watson the Baconian, conception of science. Bentley takes seriously in his psychology the distinction between knowledge, appreciation, and use, contending that the psychologist must, if he is to understand his subject matter, adopt the knowing attitude.20 Watson, on the other hand, states as the twofold aim of psychology: (i) the prediction of human activity with reasonable certainty; and (2) the formulation of laws and principles whereby man's actions can be controlled by organized society.2" Although passages may easily be selected which fit awkwardly enough into such a view, the be- haviorist's goal, as thus articulated, is inextricably linked with the discovery, by the manipulation of stimuli, of responses which are "in line with progress," "good," "desirable," and "appropriate."22 Such being his aim, Watson brings upon himself the necessity of treating his subject-matter causally. The control of human response depends upon a knowledge of the various types of stimuli which affect man and "of the places where such stimuli must be applied in order to produce appropriate action.''23 "Any object in the general environment"24 may be a stimulus and its function as stimulus does 17Nevertheless, it does appear to be true that the psychological phase of the behaviorist's program comes into greater prominence in the revised edition of Behaviorism where Watsonian dogmatism is somewhat less rabid. 18Standpoint, 8 f., 20. 19Vide footnote I. 20Bentley, The Field of Psychology, 1924, 13-16. 21Standpoint, 1-2. 22Behaviorism (rev. ed.), 20-47. 23Standpoint, 48. 24Behaviorism, 6.</page><page sequence="9">THE PSYCHOLOGY OF P-FUNCTION 2 71 not depend, theoretically, upon its relation to the organism; for causa- tion is characteristically efficient, transitive, unilinear.25 The stimulus incites, and then the organism moves. "The human is so built (and so are all other animals) that it must move when these stimuli assail it from within or without."26 We have here the causal schema of early English associationism minus a benevolent mind which manufactures ideas out of the sense material thrust upon it. As to the source of the conception, it should be noticed that, while Watson makes occasional reference to me- chanics,27 this science knows nothing of such a naive view of causality. Unilinear causation, as a force which "produces," "calls out," "rouses," "excites," would work havoc with any sort of mathematical formula, because all content would be compressed into one side of the equation. Every cause is instead regarded as, in some sense, an effect; every force a function of relation which may be stated in terms of differences of velocity or work, and so on. The real source of the conception appears to be common sense, which conceives the relation of one thing to another after the analogy of certain functions of the ex- periencing individual. The vicious circle traversed by Watson ac- cordingly seems to be somewhat as follows. Given a body of func- tions exhibiting a certain distinctive character known as agency, an anthropomorphic view of causality is derived therefrom, which, when it is projected in turn into the environment and used as an explanatory principle, obliterates the distinctive character of the virgin subject- matter. At this juncture, Bentley's motive for the substitution, for psychological purposes of description, of context for environment- whether 'inner' or 'outer'-becomes apparent. He does not believe that the P-functions, like the behaviorist's stimuli, happen non-con- textually as by divine fiat. Least of all does he believe that, if and when regarded causally, the organism is a closed system. But having no oracular utterance to deliver on the subject of causality, and "According to the scholastics, who derived their conception from the Platonic- Aristotelian atrla, a cause was an original substance, while an effect was either an activity of this causative thing or another substance which came to be in conse- quence of such activity. According to the rationalists of the seventeenth century, cause and effect are motions, motion tending to be regarded in turn as substantial. While it is not here intended to attribute philosophical sophistication to Watson, it is interesting to note that he adheres mainly to the scholastic notion of cause, i.e. any object (in the sense of naive epistemological realism) in the environment; and to the rationalistic conception of effect i.e. some sort of motion that is re- ducible to a physico-chemical substance.

Windelband, Geschichte der Philosophie, 1892, 324-326. 6Behaviorism, I97 (italics mine). 2?Standpoint, 392-394.</page><page sequence="10">272 WHITE believing that it is not incumbent upon the sciences to provide a metaphysical explanation of their subject-matter, he rests content with the more modest goal of description. Where behaviorism inclines toward the right, psychoanalysis in- clines toward the left of the psychology of P-function. Elsewhere the author has subjected psychoanalysis to more extended analysis,28 pointing out that the practical motive, which is historically respon- sible for Freud's speculative approach to the meaning of the neurotic symptom, accounts primarily for the introduction of features which mar psychoanalysis as a psychological system. While the analysis was mainly critical, the constructive suggestion was offered that, since psychoanalysis deals with ways in which symptoms evolve in the life-history of the patient, these phenomena are primarily functions and functional products. Unnecessary difficulties might therefore be avoided by the elimination of the substantive and causal features. If these functions were grounded in the total organism instead of a doubtful mental substance, and if description supplanted causal explanation, psychoanalysis would swing decidedly in the direction of the psychology of P-function. While Watson, as we have seen, proceeds in close analogy with physiology, Freud ignores physiology as irrelevant to his purpose. But like behaviorism, psychoanalysis is interested in practical con- trol; and so the treatment here, as there, necessitates causal explana- tion, but in terms of mental substance instead of physical substance. Psychoanalysis arose as "a method of treating nervous patients medically."29 The peculiarity of several neuroses is that no cor- responding organic lesions have as yet been laid bare, the correction of which will bring about recovery. "There are either no discoverable corresponding changes of the anatomical organ of the soul," Freud declares, "or else the changes are of such a nature as to yield no en- lightment."'30 On account of this sterility of the physiological approach, the symptom is diagnosed and treated psychologically. "We shall entirely ignore the fact that the psychic apparatus with which we are here dealing is also familiar to us as an anatomical specimen... . We shall remain on psychological ground."" On this basis, a therapeutic program has been inaugurated, the clinical success of which confirms 28The categories of substance, cause and function in Freud's psychology, Psychol.

While in this respect psychoanalysis resembles the psychology of P-function, a difference between the two appears in the causal etiology of the former. In so far as Freud's genetic account of the symptom is descriptive, it differs in no essential detail from the genetic account of function given in The Field of Psychology.32 But Freud, as has been suggested, is not content to stop with anything short of causal explanation; and his handling of the concept of causality is little, if any, more satisfactory than Watson's. Vitalism and mech- anism are left side by side without any creditable attempt to re- move the discrepancy between them and this despite the question as to whether the psychologist need involve himself in philosophical discussions of this nature. In fact, the negative importance of causal explanation for etiological purposes as illustrated by this inconsistency on the part of Freud appears to cast grave suspicion upon the line of argument designed to show that the scientist must provide an ex- planation of the subject-matter he is to describe. The nearest we can come to a unit of explanation for Freud is un- conscious idea or force. In rebelling against traditional psychology, Freud seemingly makes the common mistake of failing to replace the foundation of the view against which he launches his attack. Traditional psychology had held that psychological activity and con- sciousness are coextensive; that psychological subject-matter is homogeneous in kind; and that mind differs in kind from body. Be- ing convinced, by his study of neurotic symptoms in their genetic setting, of the r6le of psychological activities which have no ex- periential coloring, Freud virtually equates psychological activity and the "unconscious" ("consciousness" being a sort of "sense organ" only); but the rest of the foundation is hardly shaken, except that his terminology threatens, at times, the homogeneity of his subject- matter. As regards method, psychoanalysis is decidedly inferior to the psychology of the P-functions and to behaviorism, both of which, as we have seen, insist on high standards of experimental control. Psychoanalysis proceeds by clinical divination, and explains in terms of an assumed mental substance. The practical utility of this method when used as a therapeutic expedient may readily be conceded; but "Field, 491-509.</page><page sequence="12">274 WHITE until it is brought to a more empirical level psychoanalysis can scarcely-as its defender Fliigel concedes33-claim recognition as a science. By way of summary, we may say that the psychology of the P-functions has developed a thoroughgoing functional point of view, cutting free both from the structural type of analysis and from those compromising kinds of functionalism which have been drawn either from a teleological biology of adaptive ends or from the logic of cogni- tion. This psychology of the P-functions differs, on the one side, from behaviorism in its system of reference and in its fundamental treat- ment of perceiving, remembering, acting, understanding, thinking, and the like, and, on the other side, from psychoanalysis in its ex- purgation of mental substances and causes. If differs from both in avoiding problems of ontology as well as in aiming at description for sci- entific purposes instead of at prediction and control for practical ends.
