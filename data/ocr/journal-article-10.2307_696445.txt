THE fact that M. de Visser's book is a ' doctor-dissertation' would seem to indicate that he is, relatively speaking, but at the com- mencement of his researches in Comparative Religion. So much the more credit is in that case due to him for having combined the rAles of classical scholar and anthro- pologist so successfully as he has done. That the scholar should predominate over the anthropologist is but natural, seeing that he has set himself what is primarily a scholar's task, namely the compilation of Schrift-quellen to illustrate Greek Religion on what might be loosely termed its 'pre- anthropomorphic' side. Book I. (pp. 3-31) and Book III. (pp. 209-70) are, as in bulk, so in intrinsic value decidedly inferior to Book II. (pp. 32-208). The former of these supplementary parts enunciates the</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. 327 author's anthropological presuppositions ; the latter offers a vindemiatio prima of con- jectural elucidations. Now the methods of the palaeontologist of culture are unhappily by no means so exact as to enable any given fragment of bone to be with certainty referred to this or that typical form of skeleton. Moreover many of the fragments collected by M. de Visser are woefully minute and battered. Hence it were manifestly unfair to expect from our author any connected account of the 'origins' of Greek Religion as such. It is in fact rather as a protest against 'philological' attempts to do this very thing that his work claims our favourable regard. Viewed in this light, namely as an almost monotonous, but by no means unnecessary, reiteration of the caution 'For Greek Religion vide General Anthropology,' his supplementary books ought at least to serve to remind the purely classical scholar of his limitations. On the other hand, the contribution in the way of raw material is so lucidly presented as to offer the greatest assistance to the student whose business is the interpretation of ' survivals,' so long as the latter possess even a moderate acquaintance with the Greek language. To deal first with Book II-four categories of sacred objects are recognised, Stones, Stocks, Trees and Animals. The first class ranges from apyo'L XlOo to cones, obelisks, pyramids, columns, hermae, and so forth. It was, perhaps, natural to consider in this context the iplpaia, or roadside cairns to which each wayfarer was wont to add his quota; though, according to M. de Visser's hesitating conjecture, the stones are but a substitute for the gifts once showered on certain holy spots, ' totemistic altars' or what not, and are thus in themselves not sacred. He may be referred to Mr. Hartland's Legend of Perseus (2. 204-11) for a far more probable explanation of the rite in question. If the stones be supposed (like the grass, twigs, etc., similarly heaped up by savages) to represent a formal means of communion with a local 'power,' such a power being always more or less of a UGvapEs &amp;v ij vav'twv, a being equally capable of beneficent or malevolent action, we are at oncefurnished with a general clue, and in particular a enabled to bring the ipyaZa' into relation with the widespread custom, possibly alluded to in Eustath. ad Od 16. 471, of piling a cairn on the murderer's grave (as may likewise be done in regard to the grave of a famous warrior, cf. Adair. Ilist. Am. Ind. 184). The class of Stocks is provisionally distinguished, because the author-wisely, as I think-inclines to make the connection hinted at in Tyler's compound expression ' stock-and-stone-worship' rather than to ex- plain $Oava and the like in terms of Tree- worship understood as the cult of certain vegetation-spirits. Under this head we are presented with a rather miscellaneous group of facts, including rpo7ra^a, raXkdX8a, and the wooden phallus of Hermes Cyllenius. As regards Tree-worship proper, the data, though numerous, are unfortunately somewhat lacking in illustrative quality, being in considerable part supplied by coins, gems, wall-pictures, and names of more or less doubtful etymology and history. The section on Animal-worship, on the other hand, provides us with much that excites, if it does not go far towards satisfying, the passion for interpretation. Instances are given of relationship being claimed with animals (p. 129), of taboos on killing and eating them (ib. and p. 132), and of their burial with solemn rites (p. 133 and p. 135), which at once suggest an endless number of parallels taken from savage custom. It is a pity, by the way, that the indirect evidence adduced in Book III. in support of the view that the Greeks were addicted to 'Totemism' was not given a substantial place in this section. It might likewise have thrown light on the many-sided character of Greek Animal- worship if the writer had not limited himself rigidly to the phenomena of cult, but had also levied a contribution on mythology with its 'Gorgons and Hydras and Chimaeras dire.' Speaking generally, M. de Visser's citations are well-chosen, well-arranged, and copious. His list is, perhaps, not ideally complete. For example, Mr. L. R. Farnell points out to me the omission in connection with Totemism of any mention of the 'OSLo- yves (Pliny, N. H. 28. 30, Strabo, p. 588. Varro ap. Prise. 10. 32) ; in connection with the question of sacred boundary-stones dis- cussed pp. 212-3 of a reference to Demosth. Halonnes. p. 86 flwjuos 70o Ato 'o 70U T ptov; and, as regards the epuaLa, of any allusion to another scholiast on Od. 16. 471 who, taken together with Eustathius ad loc., suggests the curious problem whether the Roman milestones may not have had a religious origin. Still, as it stands, the 'heap of witness' to M. de Visser's industry is of goodly proportions and of the greatest value. As to Book I, my criticism put shortly</page><page sequence="3">328 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. amounts to this, that M. de Visser, finding himself forced to choose amongst a number of representative theories, has, for brevity's sake, if not through excess of faith, ven- tured to give to the fruits of his eclecticism an appearance of system and finality such as the present state of our knowledge most certainly does not warrant. Thus he dog- matically posits Animism as the basis of universal religion without noting the ambigu- ity of the term as used by anthropologists. He does not distinguish between the attri- bution of mere life, and that of soul or spirit, to material objects, with the result that he is forced quite unnecessarily to postulate an 'animus' which inhabits the aerolite or the stone held sacred in virtue of its peculiar shape. Or again, Fetichism as defined by Schulze and Totemism as explained in Frazer's manual are made mutually exclus- ive as relating respectively to individual material objects and to classes, whether of these or of animals and plants. But how can he stomach such a fact as that the sun is with Schulze a fetish and with Frazer a totem ? Once more as regards Animal-wor- ship, he has borrowed from Frazer's Golden Bough the notion of a plurality of irreducible forms of theriomorphic cult: yet he cannot refrain from hunting in company with Jevons after the mare's nest of a universal homo- geneous ' totemistic religion.' In a word, our author seems scarcely to realise that these and such as these are but the temporary labels marking the capacious pigeon-holes into which anthropologists are still busy shooting their raw facts almost at random ; and that they can contain in themselves no principle of explanation so long as their connotation remains almost wholly indeter- minate as at present. That the elucidations which compose Book III are sparse and tentative consti- tutes in my opinion a proof of the author's good sense and moderation. His researches yield virtually no crucial instances in the matter of origins; for these he must go to savagery, and, I would add, to savagery as studied at first-hand. Meanwhile, he has little to say about Stone-worship that carries us back behind the bare facts as cited by' his authorities. His attempt to connect the veneration of Trees and Animals with Manes-worship comes to nothing. Or again, as regards his laborious inquiries concerning Totemism, is there any use in trying to find it in the background of Greek or Indo-Ger- mahic religion till one knows more precisely what one is looking for ? To take but one example of the looseness of his argument, he puts down the ceremonious burial of cicadae marinae practised by the Seriphians (pp. 226-7 cf. p. 135) as totemistic on the strength of a parallel custom in respect to owls quoted in Frazer's Totemism from Samoa. Yet in Tylor's Remarks on Totemism, with which M. do Visser is presumably acquainted, since he quotes it in his notes to pp. 13, 14, it is shewn at some length that the ascription to the Samoans of totems in any sense of that much-abused word is an utterly gratuitous piece of hypo- thesis (J. A. I. New Ser. 1. 142-3). Meanwhile, the section on the progress of anthropomorphism in Greek religious thought stands by itself as a valuable con- tribution to a subject which it is well within the compass of the classical scholar to illus- trate and explain. It is just at the point at which customary religion becomes mark- edly self-conscious and self-justificatory that the student of savage beliefs comes to the end of his clues. The actual transition to what may be called dogmatic religion pre- sents a relatively untouched problem. Would he but focus his energies on this special point, M. de Visser with his know- ledge of the facts, his flair for the primitive, his distrust of symbolistic interpretations, and his power of piercing through aetio- logical pretence, is capable of rendering the greatest of service to Comparative Religion.
