Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 201 1. 416 pp. $29.50 (cloth). James D. Drake's award- winning The Nations Nature: How Con- tinental Presumptions Gave Rise to the United States of America reinter- prets American history from the Seven Years' War to the ratification of the Constitution through the metageographical imagination of early Americans.1 Eighteenth-century British colonists, Drake argues, embraced contemporary scientific taxonomies that linked and natu- ralized geography, political systems, and racial hierarchies. Largely ignorant of the true continental landscape, colonists "imagined" a geography that in turn became central to who they were. In other words, Drake argues that British North Americans became Ameri- cans through the construction of a "continental" identity created in reference to an "imagined natural space" (p. 154). Furthermore, these continental presumptions had tremendous causal power in the Seven Years' War, the American Revolution, and the creation and ratifica- tion of the Constitution. Well written and well researched, this ambitious and stimulat- ing reinterpretation of Revolutionary America is thinly predicated on the "metageographic presumptions" of elite white male colonists and relies on the power of language to shape and express unconscious notions of self and nation. Drake is thus forced to read and interpret sources to demonstrate a "continental" identity colonists and patriots infrequently consciously expressed. Adrift in an imagined space shap- ing unconsciously arrived at notions of self, nation, and polity, many readers will find metageographical rhetoric lacking as an interpretive framework for Revolutionary America. 1 Nation's Nature won the Walker Cowan Memorial Prize awarded by the University of Virginia Press.</page><page sequence="2">984 JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, DECEMBER 20I2 Drake's book is divided into two parts, seven chapters and an epi- logue. Part 1, chapters 1-3, lays out the basic premise and develops the narrative to the beginning of the American Revolution. Part 2, chap- ters 4-7, uses the ideas established in part 1 to reinterpret the Revolu- tion, and the writing and ratification of the Constitution. The brief epilogue examines the demise of metageographic presumptions, even as continental ambitions survived. In part I Drake forcefully and convincingly argues that colonial Americans fused the new scientific taxonomie systems with geogra- phy, racial theory, and notions of polity to establish three basic ideas common to the elite white men he studies: first, the continent was a coherent and natural whole; second, Britons were naturally best suited for domination of the continent; third, the projected demographic dominance of the Britons in North America was confirmation that their rule over the continent was natural. Merging scientific ideas with "geopolitical" visions, colonists imagined the "continent" as "an inher- ently unified entity" (p. 154) that nature demanded they rule. Having established this intellectual framework Drake then applies these ideas to the series of events that began with the Seven Years' War and culminated in the ratification of the Constitution and are commonly referred to by early American historians as Revolutionary America. The Seven Years' War, Drake argues, was an effort by Brit- ons and British colonists armed with "assumptions about continents and corollary notions about race and demography ... to drive others out of North America" (p. 69). Conceptualizing the Imperial crisis of the 1760s through the looking glass of colonists' continental presump- tions, Drake concludes that colonists perceived themselves a "dis- tinct" political community "unnaturally" dominated by a distant Par- liament (p. 109). Colonists thus imagined Britain as an opponent "by virtue of its geography" (p. 1 54). Continental presumptions were also, according to Drake, critical to military victory. Demoralized by their early military losses, colonists' continental identity proved critical to rousing patriotic feeling at key moments and was "no less important than, say, Washington's crossing the Delaware, or France's declara- tion of war on Britain in determining the outcome of the Revolution" (p- 113 )â™¦ A continental identity, Drake concludes, was also key to Patriots' success in forging a federal union drawing disparate regions together into a governable whole under the principles enshrined in the Constitution. Drake's argument is strongest when he deals with intellectual con- cepts his subjects directly engage. Thus, his discussion of eighteenth- century taxonomy and the implications of these ideas for political</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 985 culture are especially absorbing. Analyzing the anthropomorphic assumptions that fueled the debates between Jefferson, Buffon, and others, Drake demonstrates how elite white men of this generation "naturalized" American domination over the continent as part of a "system" in a manner consistent with other "systems" being developed across Europe to explain the natural world and human societies. Nation's Nature might thus have been titled Nature's Nation ; in the eyes of the colonists, Drake suggests, "nature dictated" the national (p. 155). This part of the book is consistent with recent work by Jessica Riskin whose French Enlightenment "sentimental empiricists" imagined nature and society as harmonious and balanced "systems" complete with an inter- nal and "natural" logic.2 It is also an interesting addendum to Benedict Anderson's "imagined" rhetorical communities.3 In Nation's Nature the national "we" is a taxonomie and metageographic construction. Drake's argument that this intellectual milieu helped form colonists' geopolitical vision and encouraged their national and Revolutionary ambitions is an important contribution to the Revolutionary literature. However, Drake wants us to see more than that; he wants these incho- ate and often unconscious ideas to have direct causal power in specific circumstances with concrete outcomes. The problem, however, is get- ting at the sinews that connect ideas, words, and action. For some time now historians have turned to "language" as part of this effort. After all, men cannot, to paraphrase J. G. A. Pocock, do what they cannot "ver- balize."4 However Drake's dependence on rhetoric subjects him, as it does all practitioners of the linguistic turn, to the vagaries of language. In the introduction Drake warns readers against seeing a "continental identity" in every use of the word "continent" or "continental" (p. 5), but alas the temptation proves too strong and Drake repeatedly uses the words as proof for the salience of the idea; he even counts the number of times the words are used as proof of the spread of the concept (pp. 85-86, 164-167, 194-196). Language is, of course, very slippery and, as Drake acknowledges, Anglo-Americans used "continent" and "con- tinental" in a variety of contexts and to describe both "imagined" and "real" places. To assume that the words "continent" and "continental" imply "continental" thinking is deeply problematic. Here we see the 2 Jessica Riskin, Science in the Age of Sensibility: The Sentimental Empiricists of the French Enlightenment (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2002). 3 Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflection on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (London: Verso, 1991). 4 J.

This dilemma is especially self-evident in Drake's discussion of the origins of the "Continental" in Continental Congress and Continental Army. Finding no direct sources explaining this unprecedented nomen- clature he nevertheless argues that "people . . . silently acceded" to the increased use of the label, and that it unconsciously expressed a broader identity (p. 166). Emerging "spontaneously, and almost instantly" without "debate or dissension" the use of "Continental" to describe patriot institutions galvanized Congressional "delegates and other col- onists during the transitional period from 1774 to 1776" (p. 155). At the same time, however, Drake acknowledges that these institutions were hardly popular or supported over the length of the Revolution. The question then is, why were institutions identified with the very metageographic presumptions that Drake argues drove the Revolution not popular? Trapped in this rhetorical dilemma, Drake undertakes a convoluted discussion of the rise and fall of the Continental Congress, suggesting that as Congress "failed" it lost its metageographic appeal and was less often referred to as "Continental." Similarly, he differenti- ates between the Continental Army "as aspiration" and "in reality." Drake's conclusion that Americans did not feel the need to support the Continental Army because they were confident that it had a "powerful ally in nature, that it drew sustenance from the grandeur and resources of the North American Continent" seems particularly conjectural (p. 204). These and other imaginative readings are especially glaring since when the continental paradigm might have been most obvious it is not. As Drake notes, the Continental Congress's 1779 orders to Amer- ican diplomats negotiating the peace in Europe included territorial claims roughly consistent with the borders established in the Treaty of Paris. These boundaries derived not from an "imagined natural space" or the metageographic presumptions associated with taxonomie sys- tems but from the colonial charters, the results of the Seven Years' War, and the Proclamation Line of 1763. Though Drake finds these territorial claims "audacious" he nevertheless recognizes that some of the original charters extended to the Pacific; he does not, however, explain the discrepancy between the more limited goals put forward by the Continental Congress and the continental presumptions that he argues drove colonists to war in the first place (pp. 218-220). Thus, precisely at the point where these ideas might have had their most forceful expression as conscious policy goals we find them absent. For all its shortcomings, however, early American historians and</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 987 graduate students will benefit from Nation's Nature . Students of histo- riography will also find its methodological assumptions and approach of interest regardless of specialization. Its failures and successes are a function of its paradigmatic ambitions. As such it is the latest in a long line of flawed "great books" that have with varying degrees of success shifted the ways in which we reimagine the past. JOSE R.
