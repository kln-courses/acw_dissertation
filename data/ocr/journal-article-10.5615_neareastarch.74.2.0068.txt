The identification of Tel Kin- rot/Tell el-‘Orēme with ancient Kinneret has since  been commonly accepted (Fritz and Münger 2002,  2–4; see fig. 5). The Site and Its Environs Tel Kinrot covers about 25 acres. Topographically,  the site consists of two parts: a “classical,” although  two-staged, tell on the hilltop (the “Acropolis,” ca.  2 acres in size); and a natural declivity with signifi- cant archaeological deposits descending all the way  down to the lake (the “Southeastern Slope” or the  “Lower City,” of which about 12 acres are accessible  for research). Outside the boundaries of the ancient  fortifications, rescue excavations in the 1950s and  the late 1990s have mainly produced evidence of an  Early Iron I necropolis to the north of the site (Ste- panski 2000; see fig. 6).

A  close parallel to this figurine has been found at Tell Deir ‘Alla in  the Jordan Valley in a somewhat later context (fig. 23). Human and animal motifs also appear on fragments of ves- sels retrieved from the southeastern slope. A richly decorated  handle fragment in the shape of a naked woman has circular  reed impressions on the body and arms. Although found in a  mixed fill, the clay of the fragment resembles the locally made  pottery of the Early Iron Age. Such handles are rare, but a close  parallel is known from Late Bronze Kamid el-Loz in the Biqa  Valley of Lebanon (fig. 24). More common are the animal figures that appear attached  to the rim of a bowl found in Area N (see fig. 19 on p. 82). The  figures are worn, broken, and difficult to identify, but one of  them may depict a bull or a lion(ess). The bowl with its zoo- morphic applications bears a certain resemblance to the kernoi  (Nissinen and Münger 2009; see fig. 19). Figure 24 (below). Decorated handle of an Early  Iron Age vessel.
