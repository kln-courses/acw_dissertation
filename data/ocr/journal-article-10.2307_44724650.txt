<plain_text><page sequence="1">820480 Review of Research on Thoracic Impact Tolerance and Injury Criteria Related to Occupant Protection Robert L. Hess, Kathleen Weber, and John W. Melvin Highway Safety Research Institute The University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Ml ABSTRACT The technical and scientific literature dealing with thoracic injury, to or within the rib cage, from blunt loading is reviewed. The history of the development of associated Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards is reviewed from the aspect of its relationship to the history of development of the research information. Field case data from car-to-car and car-to-tree/pole crashes has been examined and summarized. This study suggests that the laboratory research has not adequately covered the principal variables found to exist in actual injury cases. Specifically, more research attention should be given to the shape of the impactor, to the loading location and direction, and to injuries in the contusion and/or laceration family. Correspondingly, the accident investigation process needs to be more sensitive to occupant/ vehicle-interior interaction variables so that laboratory research can be properly guided. THE THORAX, WHICH HOUSES VITAL BODY ORGANS, is the site of more severe and fatal injuries (AIS 3-6) among automobile accident victims than any other body region. (1)* Protection of this region is an important concern of automotive safety design engineers and the government agency who sets Federal Motor Vehicles Safety Standards (FMVSS). Just as in the development of knowledge about head/brain injury (2), regulators and engineers have been unable to rely on field accident data to study injury mechanisms. Instead they have used the more scientific data coming from laboratory impact experiments with animals, cadavers, and human volunteers to determine an acceptable level of protection and to measure whether or not a system achieves this level. This study reviews the laboratory research on chest impact tolerance, as reported in the literature, and traces the development of occupant protection regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in relation to this research. Attention is focused on recent developments in biomechanical knowledge about the thorax. Clinical literature on thoracic injury is also reviewed, and ^Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. observations are made based on information from field accident cases. Suggestions for further research are then presented. EARLY RESEARCH ON THORACIC TOLERANCE AND INJURY MECHANISMS: 1946-1966 Much of the research during this period, in which basic engineering data were sought with regard to thoracic impact tolerance and blunt injury mechanisms, is summarized in the state- of-the-art paper by Mertz and Kroell.(3) Only selected work reviewed there that relates to FMVSS development, as well as some whole-body acceleration research, will therefore be mentioned here. Bierman, Wilder, and Hellems(4) reported on tests in which young male volunteers received chest impacts through a restraining harness attached to a dropped-weight device. With a standard lap/double-shoulder harness configuration (76 sq. in.), load "tolerance," defined as producing a painful reaction and various minor injuries, was found to be about 2000 lb. These tests led to the development of a vest-type restraining harness that distributed loads over a larger area (156 sq. in.) and absorbed some of the energy through controlled stretching. With this harness, peak loads in the range of 1800 to 3000 lb., the peaks being reached at 50 to 70 ms, were sustained without injury. The experiments also confirmed that rate of onset affected load tolerance, with peaks reached within less than 30 ms being "very uncomfortable. " Whole-body rocket-sled data provided by Stapp(5) and summarized by Eiband(6) indicated that harnessed thorax accelerations up to 40 g were tolerable as long as the duration of acceleration at this level did not exceed 0.1 second. The maximum voluntary tolerance observed was 45 g for 44 ms, with a pressure under the restraining harness calculated to be 36.5 psi. Rate of onset was again found to affect tolerance to maximum accelerations, with peaks of 30 g reached at 1000 g/s becoming debi 1 itating. A chest load limit of 2500 lb., which is in the range found tolerable by Bierman et al. above, was incorporated into Federal Standard no. 515/4 on energy absorbing steering systems that was issued by the General Services 1974 0096-736X/83/9102-1974$02.50 Copyright 1983 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">Administration (GSA) on June 30, 1965*, and revised as 515/4a on July 15, 1966. The test procedure involved a 15 mph impact with a 75- to 80-1 b. torso-shaped body block (later to appear in an SAE standard) with a chest-area spring rate of 600 to 800 lb. /in. An additional requirement was that the steering control system could not displace rearward more than 5 inches during a 30-mph (in the revised version) barrier test. Automobile safety engineers proceeded to design energy absorbing steering wheels and columns that would meet these standards. In a brief paper describing the forthcoming SAE recommended test procedure J944 for steering wheel systems(7), Fredericks(8) noted that "the complex problems associated with tolerance of the thoracic region of the body and internal organs have not yet been delineated sufficiently to permit definition of meaningful performance requirements for chest impacts." He also observed that other parts of the body, including the abdomen, face, and neck, can also strike the steering assembly during a crash, depending on vehicle, driver, restraint, and accident variables, and that tolerance levels for these regions also need to be established. At the Ninth Stapp Conference, static and dynamic thoracic stiffness measurements were reported by Patrick, Kroell , and Mertz(9) for several embalmed cadaver subjects. Static loading in the anterior- posteri or direction by a 4-inch-wide bar yielded force-deflection values from 185 to 400 lb. /in. Chest impacts at 16.5 mph against a 6-inch-diameter padded target, however, resulted in approximately constant spring rates of 1000 lb. /in. for loads up to 900 lb. for two different subjects. Rib fractures apparently occurred at this point and stiffness dropped markedly, but it then increased again to about 500 lb. /in. as the internal organs began to be compressed. Peak forces of 1400 and 1600 lb. were reached in these tests, and chest deflection was about 1.5 and 2.5 in., respectively. Deflection was measured by way of film analysis of a rod inserted through the thorax and protruding from the back of the test subject. The authors pointed out the fundamental difference between the stiffness characteristics of the thorax under gradual vs. sudden loading conditions. The stiffer response in the latter case was explained as being due to the inerti al force gradients developed in the thoracic cavity during impact and the viscous behavior of the thoracic viscera. The behavior of the internal organs during blunt impact to the chest without rib fracture and the mechanism of resulting injuries to the arterial system were studied by Roberts, Moffat, and Berkas(lO). Anesthetized dogs were struck at midsternum by a 3-inch-diameter impactor. The authors found that tears in the aorta and great *For regulatory details, citations to and exerpts from the Federal Register can be found in Review of Literature and Regulation Relating to Thoracic Impact Tolerance and Injury Criteria, July 1981, Report No. UM-HSRI-81-38. vessels were in the transverse rather than the longitudinal directioh and therefore postulated that these tears were caused by the displacement of the heart into the left side of the chest, rather than by pressure surges within the vascular system during impact. This reasoning was probably invalid, however, because later work, for example, Yamada(ll), has shown that arterial tissue is significantly stronger in the hoop-stress direction of the vessel than along its length and is thus more likely to experience transverse tears when stressed. In 1966, the energy absorbing (EA) steering column, as described by Skeels(12), became standard equipment on most 1967 model -year domestic automobiles. A spectacular, very severe frontal collision was also reported, which was the first-known case of an EA column in a real accident. The lap-belted driver received no chest injuries whatever, the column having crushed 5 3/8 inches. STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT: 1966-1972 FMVSS 203 AND 204 - In December 1966, NHTSA proposed its own regulations to supersede 515/4a. FMVSS 203, "Impact Protection for the Driver from the Steering Control System," proposed to limit the force on the body block chest to 1800 lb., to limit the contact area pressure to 50 psi, and to require that the peak load would not be reached before 10 ms. A separate proposal, FMVSS 204, "Steering Control Rearward Displacement," placed a 3 inch limit on this displacement. Vehicle manufacturers argued that a need for a lower load limit, tested at 15 mph, did not appear to be based on laboratory test data, and that systems providing such lower loadings might in fact provide insufficient protection in real crashes at higher speeds. EA columns then in production had been designed to the earlier GSA specifications and were found to be working well in the field. The more stringent allowance for rearward displacement was objected to for similar reasons. The realism of the body block's chest stiffness was also called into question, as it would affect test results for both peak load and contact area pressure. Cadaver chests had indeed been found to be softer than the body block by Patrick et al. (9), both in static tests and in dynamic tests at high impact loads. A precise method for measuring contact area also needed to be specified. Engineers involved with designing and testing EA steering systems had determined that other factors than those addressed in FMVSS 203 were important for adequate occupant protection. These design features affected the chest/ shoulder load distribution and included the area of the steering wheel hub, the strength of the spokes, and the angle between the hub and the spokes, or the actual dish-shape of the system. When the rules were finalized in February 1967, the maximum chest load was returned to 2500 lb., the allowable dynamic rearward displacement was again 5 in., and the pressure and rate-of-onset requirements were dropped. No 1975</page><page sequence="3">1976 R. L. HESS, ET AL* changes were made, however, to the specifications of the body block. Later in the year, a general proposal was issued stating that contact-area pressure and rate-of-onset limits were still being considered. An additional proposal mentioned the possibility of requirements limiting occupant compartment intrusion from exterior impact to the front, side, rear, or roof of a vehicle. Further chest impacts with a cadaver were reported by Patrick, Mertz, and Kroel 1.(13) Tests were run at increasing velocities for the same specimen and were aimed at determining rib fracture threshold. Findings were consistent with the earlier experiments, in that rib fracture apparently occurred at about 900 pounds of load during a 16.8 mph impact, and deflection was measured at 1.7 inches for a peak load of 1 340 pounds. Impactor geometry problems precluded measurement of initial chest stiffness, but deflection of 1 inch occurred at about 1000 pounds load. Design evaluation of the General Motors EA steering assembly was guided by Patrick's data and was reported by Gadd and Patrick. (14) Two embalmed, lap-belted cadavers were used in sled tests at 24.4 mph, and one subject was used in a second test at 29.4 mph. As the cadavers rotated around the lap belts into contact with the EA systems, the columns crushed from 4 to 5 3/4 inches, and the force developed on the upper body ranged from 1630 to 1810 pounds. No skeletal damage resulted from the lower speed tests, but rib fractures did occur after the higher velocity test on the repeated subject. In the case of this second cadaver, instrumentation allowed the separation of load measurements between the wheel rim and hub. Although total load was 1810 pounds in the non- injurious test, only 740 pounds were from the hub, well below the rib fracture threshold determined by Patrick et al. above for impact conditions similar to a hub alone. The wheel rim thus distributed the remainder of the load to the shoulders, abdomen, and head, but also without apparent injury. The authors concluded that the "wrap-around" effect observed in these tests significantly reduced chest loads, but that these reductions would not occur using the stiff body block of SAE J944. The state of understanding of cardiovascular injury mechanisms during thoracic impact was summarized in the introduction to a medi cal -engineering study of 67 accident cases in which such injury might be expected. Lasky, Siegel, and Nahum(15) identified three possible occurrences: 1) shearing of vessels at their attachments to the heart, 2) direct compression causing bruising and other damage, particularly when heart displacement is restricted, and 3) development of fluid pressure waves within this closed system. The authors promoted the latter concept by introducing the idea of a "third collision" between the internal organs and the thoracic skeletal structure, during which "the sudden deceleration of the blood can produce a water hammer effect," or a large increase in pressure. Results of the study confirmed the value of EA steering assemblies and brought the problem of side impact injuries to light. To quote the authors, "The mechanisms of cardi ovascul ar injury in side impact collisions appear to be caused both by direct impact with the side door and arm rest... They represent an increasing problem and will require rather specific design solutions that at least reduce interior penetration." SIDE IMPACT AND FMVSS 208 - In December 1968, a proposal on side intrusion protection was issued. Rather than providing specified limits, the proposal was in the form of a Consumer Information Regulation (CIR) that would provide an "intrusion protection value" for each car based on the work required to crush a door with a 12-inch-diameter cylinder to within 12 inches of the nearest occupant's centerline and scaled to the weight of the vehicle. Recognizing that occupants do not stay in place during impacts, the protection concept was modified in January 1970 to test for the average force required to crush a door 12 inches. The resulting value was thus to be a measure of side door strength. This informational proposal, however, was never enacted. Instead, a regulation was proposed in April 1970 that would require minimum resistance of side doors to crush. NHTSA cited the following reasons for the proposal: "Recent studies demonstrate that in side impacts the percentage of dangerous and fatal injuries increases sharply as the maximum depth of penetration increases, and that in fatal side collisions, most occupants die from side structures collapsing inward on them, rather than from their striking the door." Tests resulting in three crush depths, 6, 12, and 18 inches, were proposed with minimum forces of, respectively , 2500 lb., 3750 lb., and twice the vehicle's weight to effect this crush. The intermediate test also included a vehicle-weight adjustment factor. In the final FMVSS 214 rule issued in October, however, the force for the "initial" crush resistance test was lowered to 2250 lb. for the benefit of small cars, the weight factor was removed and the force reduced to 3500 lb. for the "intermediate" test, and a ceiling of 7000 lb. was placed on the "peak" crush test for the benefit of larger cars. A proposal issued in May 1970 was the first to incorporate automatic (passive) crash protection into FMVSS 208. The restraint systems were to be tested against "basic injury criteria with reference to an anthropomorphic dummy, expressed in terms of maximum forces and pressures on critical parts of the body." The tests were to use the dummy described in SAE J963 ( 16 ) and consisted of a frontal fixed- barrier crash at 30 mph the first year as well as lateral and rollover tests the following year. The proposal specified that "the resultant chest acceleration shall not exceed 40 g." Unlike the criteria for head protection, acceleration was not allowed to exceed this limit even for a few milliseconds. In addition, the force developed on the chest was limited to 1200 lb. and the pressure to 50 psi. Arguments from the automobile industry and justifications from NHTSA have been summarized</page><page sequence="4">OCCUPANT PROTECTION 1977 in a report by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board(17). In a moment of candor at a public meeting on the proposal, an NHTSA spokesman stated that its problem was "to establish levels of tolerance based on the best data which was available. In some cases, the data was not available." An industry spokesman certainly agreed when he commented that "apart from the requirements of S.4.4.2 [head acceleration criteria], we know of no published data which could have been used as a basis for the injury criteria levels given in this section." Indeed, the use of resultant acceleration at a single location as a measure of potential injury is more appropriate to a somewhat rigid body, such as the head, than it is to a very flexible structure like the thorax. Although the chest dynamic spring rate specified for the SAE J963 dummy was 800 to 1000 lb. /in., a range similar to initial chest stiffness found experimentally in cadavers, the relationship between the test criteria and real injury was questionable. In the laboratory, research continued with the goal of establishing reliable thorax dynamic response and injury tolerance data. Nahum, Gadd, et al. (18) conducted tests of both embalmed and unembalmed cadavers and compared the results to those of Patrick et al. in 1965(9) and Patrick et al. in 1967(13) Subjects were struck at known velocities by a 6-inch- diameter, 42.5-pound, rigid surface impactor. This test method effected impact conditions similar to those of the earlier tests. Load- deflection curves and rib fracture data, both from X-ray diagnosis and dissection, indicated that the fracture threshold occurred at about 2 inches deflection, a value consistent with Patrick's findings, but that thoraxes were less stiff and damage occurred at lower loads than in the earlier studies. The unembalmed specimens in the current study sustained larger deflections and more fractures at lower force levels than did the embalmed cadavers in any of the studies. Rib fractures occurred in five of six unembalmed subjects under maximum loads ranging from 350 to 680 lb. The authors postulated that the differences in gross chest stiffness might be related to differences in embalming procedures, as well as the lack thereof, but they cautioned that an unembalmed, aged cadaver subject might not in fact be a good representation of the living vehicle occupant population. The authors also suggested that thoracic injury criteria should be based on actual internal injury to the lungs, liver, aorta, etc., rather than on rib fracture only. A revised FMVSS 208 proposal was issued in September 1970 that allowed a cumulative period of 2 ms during which chest acceleration could exceed 40 g. In addition, the requirements for force and pressure limits were dropped. NHTSA stated that "Most commenters felt that the force and pressure measurements specified were beyond the state of the art," and that criteria based on acceleration alone was determined to be adequate. In the same Federal Register issue, however, NHTSA proposed to lower the allowable loads on the body block chest in FMVSS 203 back to 1800 lb., while raising the test velocity to 20 mph. As justification, the agency stated that "The increasing amount of knowledge about thoracic injury threshold levels suggests that the allowable forces should be reduced." In addition, a minimum contact area of 40 square inches would be required, the steering wheel hub would have to be padded, and the rim flexible enough to allow body block contact across its full diameter. These changes were never put into effect, however, and no new revisions of the FMVSS 203 requirements have been proposed. In November 1970, the first automatic restraint rule was issued, with the chest acceleration at 40 g, except for 2 ms, as proposed. The force and pressure criteria were dropped because they "were primarily related to belt-type systems, and it has been found that no accurate means of determining these values presently exists." At the same time, a limit on the lateral component of chest acceleration of 20 g, except for a cumulative period of 2 ms, was proposed, along with lateral and rollover tests. NHTSA claimed that "biomechanical studies" were showing tolerance to lateral acceleration for both head and chest to be much less than frontal tolerance. A review of the literature on animal and human lateral impact tests, reported later by McElhaney, Stalnaker, et al. (19), supported this contention. INJURY INDEXES AND CHANGING CRITERIA - The Severity Index (SI), as described in SAE J885a(20), had become generally accepted as a fruitful step in the direction of calculating head injury potential, but there were no corresponding index and threshold values for the chest. At the Fourteenth Stapp Conference, Brinn and Staffeld(21) proposed a damage index, based on the relative displacement of body organs and structures, that could replace the SI for head acceleration tolerance and could also be used to predict thoracic injury from whole- body acceleration and blunt impact. This Effective Displacement Index (EDI) used a simple spring-mass model for the body part of interest to determine displacement as a result of input pulses of various shapes and durations. For whole-body rocket-sled data, Stapp(5) calculated not only the EDI but also the SI, noting that the latter had been employed for chest impacts by "some safety testers." The tolerable 45-g run referred to previously resulted in an SI of 972, a value very close to the head injury threshold of 1000. No Si's were calculated, however, for blunt chest impact experiments. For assessment of the latter type of injury, that found most commonly in the automotive environment, the authors recommended obtaining the EDI from a direct measurement of sternal deflection. In their closure, however, they commented that the crushing injuries now seen might change to the inerti al -type injuries of the rocket-sled tests if broad, soft surfaces, such as air bags, proved practical in the future. In February 1971, NHTSA announced its intention to relax the chest injury criteria by raising the maximum resultant chest acceleration to 60 g , except for a cumulative period of 3 ms,</page><page sequence="5">1978 R# L# HESS, ET AL. in tests of automatic restraint systems. No separate lateral limit was mentioned. The rule was issued in March with the 60-g/3-ms requirement, to be measured at the center of gravity of the upper thorax, along with the following comments: "Several petitions stated that the chest injury criteria were set at too low a level. In some respects, a higher "g- level" on the chest actually increases the protective capabilities of the system, if properly designed, since it more effectively utilizes the available space in which the occupant can "ride down" the crash impact--an especially important factor in higher speed crashes." In the same ruling, the SI was adopted as the criterion for head protection, but it was rejected for the chest because "The severity index is based on biomechanical data derived from head injury studies and does not adapt itself readily to chest-injury usage." Ever since the SAE J963 dummy had been established as the test device, there had been objections on the grounds that it was inadequately specified and did not therefore yield repeatable test results. In addition, it was not designed to provide human-like biomechanical response. Once the rule was issued, with the justification that the dummy was "the best available," criticism mounted, and the issue became the basis of a suit to block the entire automatic restraint ruling. In October 1971, a further proposal was made that would require manual belt systems, which were to have been temporarily allowed and had hitherto been exempt from the test procedures, to meet the same injury criteria as the automatic systems and also include an ignition interlock. These requirements were adopted in February 1972 to become effective August 1973. At the Fifteenth Stapp Conference, Mertz and Gadd(22) provided some interesting support for the 60-g limit on chest acceleration. An instrumented stunt man jumped from 57 feet to land on his back on a thick foam mattress and registered a resultant acceleration at midsternum of 49.2 g without discomfort. After additionally reviewing human tolerance literature, the authors concluded that there was no evidence that "even a 60 g chest acceleration level would not be tolerable with an adequate restraint system" for pulse durations less than 100 ms. They recognized, however, that frontal chest impacts were characterized by compression, and that "internal organ tolerance to trauma produced by chest compression should be specified in terms of a thoracic compression limit and not an acceleration limit." NHTSA responded in July 1972 to petitions that the injury criteria requirements were not appropriate for belt systems. "To ease the [chest] requirement somewhat without permitting excessive long duration accelerations," NHTSA ruled that SK1000 would now become the chest injury criterion for seat belt systems manufactured before August 1975. Other restraint systems continued to be required to meet the the 60-g/3-ms criterion, and it was expected that belt systems would also eventually be able to meet the same criterion. In response to comments that the SI was not intended for chest application, NHTSA stated in October that "it provides a reasonable interim measure of the effectiveness of the belt system." Two days later, a proposal was issued to extend SK1000 as the chest injury criterion for all types of restraints manufactured before August 1975, because the former criterion "causes occasional failures of restraint systems whose overall protective capabilities are judged to be good." The agency went on to say "the index operates as a check on the high amplitude, long duration spikes that present the greatest hazard to vehicle occupants." The rule incorporating the above was issued in November 1972. DUMMY DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION: 1972-1978 During this period, experimental work was largely directed toward establishing data upon which an anthropomorphic test device (ATD) with a reasonable degree of biofidelity could be constructed. Many imagined that such a test device could become the primary human surrogate for automobile crash testing. IMPACT RESPONSE CORRIDORS - Impact tests of ten cadaver chests, using a 22-pound, 6-inch- diameter impactor at 13 mph, were performed by Stalnaker, McElhaney, et al. (23), and force- deflection curves were reported and compared to results of previous experimenters. The most consistent finding was the relationship between rib fracture and rib cage deflection, no fractures being associated with deflections up to 2.1 inches in this study. Static compression tests using both human volunteers and cadavers confirmed that chest stiffness varied upward relative to the following conditions: 1) unembalmed cadaver, 2) embalmed cadaver, 3) relaxed volunteer, and 4) tense volunteer. The middle two, however, overlapped to a large extent. Using dynamic load-deflection data published previously by Nahum et al. (18) and Kroell, Schneider, and Nahum(24), Lobdell, Kroell, et al. (25) developed recommended chest response corridors for these two velocity/ impactor-mass conditions as performance guidelines for the design of dummy chest structures. Basically, for a 16-mph impact with a 51-pound mass, forces up to 1200 pounds and deflections up to 3 inches were considered acceptable. Five dummy designs currently in use were then tested under the same conditions. None, including the General Motors Hybrid I, responded within the corridors. In general, the deflections were reasonable up to 1 inch (the spring rate in SAE J963 was measured in the .75- to 1.0-inch range), but the forces required to continue deflection were much too great. None of the dummies tested achieved compressions beyond 2 inches. If used to test a restraint system, these dummies would yield excessive chest loads and accelerations. Finally, a mathematical model of a thorax and impactor was developed that was based on a 3-mass, 4 degree- of- freedom mechanical analog. The model simulations were found to correlate well with</page><page sequence="6">OCCUPANT PROTECTION I979 actual cadaver impact tests, including that of Stalnaker et al. (23) The authors suggested this model could be used as a tool for improving dummy thorax design. PART 572 AND OTHER ATD' S - As a result of the court decision of December 5, 1972, invalidating the FMVSS 208 test procedures because the test dummy was not adequately specified, NHTSA proposed to adopt the GM Hybrid II as the test device for automatic restraint systems. This commercially available dummy had adequate documentation and was known to be highly repeatable. The chest structure was quite similar to the Hybrid I, however, and its impact response did not therefore fall within the corridors recommended above, but neither did the chest stiffness specified in the proposed regulation. The test procedure called for a 51.5-pound, 6-inch-diameter impactor to strike the dummy chest at 14 fps (9.5 mph) and 22 fps (15 mph). The forces were not to exceed 1400 and 2100 lb., respectively , and the deflections were not to be greater than 1.0 and 1.6 inches. These values described the performance of the Hybrid II, but did not particularly relate to the human. Nevertheless, a new Part 572 was added to Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations in August 1973 that established this "Part 572 dummy" as NHTSA1 s test device. In the meantime, another court decision related to test dummy inadequacies resulted in the issuance of a regulation in June 1973 that eliminated all dynamic tests for manual belt systems as long as they were allowed. Automatic belt systems would still have to meet certain injury criteria under dynamic test conditions. Later that year at the Seventeenth Stapp Conference, another test device, "Repeatable Pete," was introduced by McElhaney, Mate, and Roberts. (26) The general design goals for this dummy were repeatability, reproducibil ity, biofidelity, and durability. The chest was designed and constructed to match the dynamic response of unembalmed cadavers as determined by Stalnaker et al. (23) in 13-mph impact tests. Similar tests of the dummy's chest showed that its load-deflection curve fell within that cadaver test-band. The development of this dummy thorax was therefore a closed-loop process, in which the same laboratory made mechanical measurements, designed a physical model, and evaluated this model using the same equipment, instrumentation, and procedures. The result was a repeatable test device that also had good biomechanical response. At the Third International Conference on Occupant Protection in 1974, Neathery, Mertz, et al. (27) presented their evaluation of this dummy. Although they found that it was superior in many respects to the GM Hybrid II, particularly with regard to thorax biofidelity, they did not think the complete dummy system was sufficiently developed to be used for restraint system qualification testing. Tennant, Jensen, and Potter(28) then reported on another dummy, the GM-ATD 502, which was developed under contract to NHTSA. General goals were similar to those of the HSRI program, but thorax impact response was to be within the load-deflection corridors recommended by Lobdell et al. (25) This latter objective was not met, and the authors recommended that this dummy also not be used to determine the protective capabilities of restraint systems because of its insufficient biofidelity. The authors pointed out the problems of developing a dummy component based on the best available biomechanical data, but then having to test it as part of a complete dummy system. "It means that the performance of structures such as the neck, lumbar, and arms are also a part of the results of this test. Therefore, the rib-cage performance indicated by this test changes if any of the other components perform differently, and the development of the rib-cage depends on these other components being in the final design testing stage and being repeatable." DEFLECTION CRITERIA: FURTHER CADAVER IMPACT DATA AND ANALYSIS - Tolerance to lateral impact was the subject of a paper by Stalnaker, Roberts, and McEl haney (29) also presented at the Seventeenth Stapp Conference. The 22-pound, 6- i nch-di ameter impactor, used in the frontal experiments, was again used here, but both a flat surface and one simulating an armrest were employed. The impact device could be preset to stop within a range of 1.8 to 3.8 inches and could maintain a constant velocity up to 3 inches of penetration. Impacts were made to both human cadavers and live infrahuman primates. Data from the latter tests were scaled relative to chest depths and breadths (called an aspect ratio) to estimate human side impact tolerance. Results of both series led to a deflection criterion for predicting chest injury. The authors suggested that a lateral deflection of 2.65 in., achieved during a 21.6- mph, 25-ms impact, would result in a 900- lb. load and a serious, but reversible injury, or level 3 on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS).* (The deflection value was later corrected by Mel vin, Mohan, and Stal naker(30) to 3.72 in. for an AIS-3 injury, while 2.65 in. was estimated to be a non-fracture deflection level for the average male.) Commenting on the various parameters that might be used to evaluate chest injury, the authors eliminated acceleration as being "very awkward because of the different accelerations encountered throughout the chest during impact," and force as being "cumbersome because of its dependence upon the weight of the upper torso." They concluded that, "Since most chest injuries were found to be related to the deflections of the rib cage, chest displacement was chosen for this study as the indicator for thoracic *This 6-point injury scale is briefly: 0 none, 1 minor, 2 moderate, 3 serious, 4 severe, 5 critical, 6 unsurvi vable. At this time, rib fractures were coded as AIS-2 or 3. In 1980, the scheme was revised, and rib fractures alone are currently considered AIS-1 or 2. Further internal injury results in a higher AIS.

HESS, ET AL. injury." The findings of this and the previous frontal -impact study(23) were later conveniently summarized and integrated by Stalnaker and Mohan(31), but this paper should be used in conjunction with the corrected figures found in Mel vin, et al. (30) Basically, however, the conclusion was that, for either frontal or lateral impact, a chest deflection in the range of 30% to 35% of the corresponding chest dimension would result in an AIS-3 level injury, while a deflection of up to 20% to 23% would probably not result in any fracture. Kroell , Schneider, and Nahum(32) reported data from 23 additional cadaver tests at the Eighteenth Stapp Conference. These data were integrated with their previous results(18,24), and full documentation of test procedures and results were provided. After impact, the cadavers in this series were subjected to complete thoracic and abdominal necropsy, and AIS values were assigned. Correlation coefficients were then calculated for AIS vs. both peak load and chest deflection, the latter being expressed as a percentage of chest depth. Correlation with force was poor (r = .524), but deflection again proved to be a reasonable predictor of injury (r = .772), with AIS-3 injuries being associated with chest deflections in the range of 28% to 33%, although the regression line indicated 34% deflection for AIS-3 when all injury levels were analyzed. The authors suggested that further parameters, such as cadaver age and size, would contribute to an even better correlation. Although further analysis was indicated, this work was significant in that enough data of a similar type existed to allow such models of injury potential to be developed. Neathery(33) was motivated to perform such a multivariate analysis of the available chest impact data, because these data applied to subjects of widely varying physical characteristics but were being used to predict the response of a 50th percentile male. The author therefore wished to find an appropriate means of scaling these data to determine thoracic response corridors for a range of dummy sizes. Using dimensional analysis methods, six dimensionless terms were devised based on cadaver characteri sties (mass, height, chest depth, age), test conditions (impactor mass, impact velocity, gravity), and test results (peak plateau force, maximum impactor penetration) . Neathery's intent was to use data from both the Kroell group and the Stalnaker group, but detailed analysis indicated that impact responses in the two series were not similarly related to the variables chosen. Male and female data also were not apparently comparable. Regression equations to predict various impact response values were therefore developed only for the ten male cadavers from Kroell' s early series. These cadaver equations were then manipulated to produce dummy response prediction equations (the age factor being dropped), and scaling rules were developed for determining biomechanically acceptable force-deflection corridors for 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile dummies tested according to Part 572. These dummy equations and associated corridors were then revised in an appendix to take Kroell' s later data, just discussed, into account. The realism of the test procedures and compliance criteria of FMVSS 208 were again called into question at the Nineteenth Stapp Conference. Although the resultant acceleration was supposedly measured at the center of gravity of the upper thorax, the accelerometer was in fact mounted on a rigid spine box, and thus it was thought to reflect spinal acceleration. Nahum, Schneider, and Kroell (34) compared sternal and spinal accelerations and resulting Si's for 18 of the unembalmed cadaver experiments reported previously. (32) The authors concluded that SK1000 is meaningless for either measurement location, the sternal Si's sometimes exceeding 20,000 and the spinal Si's usually being under 50. Although the spinal SI did correlate well with AIS (r = .720), normalized chest deflection was still recommended as the best predictor of injury for blunt impacts. The authors also attempted to calculate chest deflections by taking the difference between the second integrals of the sternal and spinal accelerations. These values were consistently high, however, and the technique was determined to be unreliable unless more precise acceleration measurements could be made. Neathery, Kroell, and Mertz(35) carried forward the previous dimensional analysis work to develop equations predicting AIS for cadavers, using data from both the Kroell and Stalnaker series, and then to establish recommended chest deflection limits for dummy test criteria. Dummy "age" was set at 45, and the corresponding penetration-to-depth ratio (or percent deflection) associated with AIS-3 injuries was determined to be .3868. Allowable penetration for a 50th percentile male dummy was thus 3.48 inches based on a chest depth of 9.0 inches. The allowable percent deflection recommended here is greater than those suggested by Mel vin et al. (30) and Kroell et al. (32), because the latter did not adjust for age. Neathery et al. went on to specify appropriate bi omechanical response corridors for the three dummy sizes in terms of sternal deflection, which is approximately 0.5 inch less than maximum chest penetration. In the process of arriving at these recommendations, the authors first demonstrated, with cadaver blunt- impact data, that the force produced by the impactor on the cadaver sternum was not predictive of the injury sustained, while at the same time body-block chest load was being used in FMVSS 203 to certify EA steering systems. They also cited the work of Nahum et al. (34) on the apparent lack of validity of the spinal acceleration and SI injury criteria of FMVSS 208, and they pointed out that bi omechanical response corridors have been defined in terms of load-deflection and not acceleration. The authors therefore came to the conclusion that, only if a dummy has proper biofidelity and if a chest deflection criterion is used, can that dummy predict injury under conditions of blunt</page><page sequence="8">OCCUPANT PROTECTION 1981 frontal impact to the chest. Further, if current practices are invalid for predicting blunt injury, such as from a steering system, they must also be questioned for other occupant protection environments. As a final word on deflection, Viano(36) cautioned against emphasizing thoracic skeletal damage to the exclusion of organ and vascular injury, which is in fact more serious. After reviewing the Kroell series of cadaver data, he concluded that deflection and injury potential have a linear relationship only to a point, and that beyond that point the rib cage collapses and the likelihood of "life-threatening" injury increases dramatically. He suggested that this stability limit for frontal chest loading was a penetration-to-depth ratio of about .32, which is consistent with previous estimates. The important point to note, however, is the critical need to stay below this level of compression lest serious injury result. LOAD CRITERIA: INTEGRATION OF LABORATORY AND FIELD ACCIDENT DATA - During the period under discussion, a number of programs combining accident investigation and laboratory simulation were undertaken. Gloyns and Mackay(37) reported that not all steering systems complying with FMVSS 203 actually provided protection for their drivers from serious chest and abdominal injury. Further, the authors observed that the damage sustained by certain systems under standard test conditions did not resemble that seen in the field. They found that a criterion of peak load alone could not distinguish between protective and non-protective designs, but that differences could be shown if effective loaded area was also taken into account. Patrick, Bohl in, and Andersson(38) analyzed the injury experience of 169 Volvo occupants restrained by three-point belts and compared this to results of 72 sled simulations using instrumented pre-Part 572 dummies in a standard Volvo interior environment. Belt loads and accelerations were measured during the tests, and SI values were calculated with the goal of determining reasonable injury threshold parameters. Among the actual accident victims, chest injuries were the most prevalent. The authors calculated that there was a 50% chance that these occupants would receive at least an AIS-3 injury at a barrier equivalent velocity (BEV) of 45 mph, which, for a dummy in the Volvo system, would result in a peak chest acceleration of 85 g, an SI of 560, and a load at the upper end of the shoulder belt of 1930 lb. The authors suggested therefore that the 60-g limit (even with the 3 ms exclusion) was too restrictive, and that the SK1000 criterion left too much leeway. The SI was also found not to be a suitable predictor of rib fracture, these fractures occurring when the Si's were estimated to range from essentially zero to 710. Belt load at the upper end of the shoulder harness was found to be "the most sensitive parameter to thoracic injury" because of its direct association with forces on the chest. Even so, rib fractures occurred in crashes ranging from 10 to 53 mph, which, when simulated, resulted in belt loads on the dummies ranging from 800 to 2310 lb. Even at the higher velocities, fewer than 40% of the occupants did indeed sustain fractures. The injury tolerance variability shown by these data emphasizes the difficulties inherent in trying to establish meaningful injury threshold parameters. Three papers comparing experimental injuries to cadavers with injuries observed in actual crashes were presented at the Nineteenth Stapp Conference: Cromack and Zi perman(39) , Patrick and Levine(40), and Tarriere, Fayon, et al. (41) All three investigations dealt with cadavers and occupants restrained by three- point lap/shoulder belts, and all found that the cadavers received more severe chest injuries in similar crash environments than did their living counterparts, although the nature of the injuries was the same. Patrick and Levine, in their study, measured upper torso belt loads on the nine cadavers tested. (The horizontal load component was also calculated, these being generally 10% to 15% lower than the measured load at typical shoulder belt angles, but only the latter loads will be cited to facilitate comparison with other studies.) For tests ranging from 20 to 40 mph BEV, loads resulting in rib fracture ranged from 1020 to 1930 lb., while the range for non- fracture was 560 to 1560 lb. Although the two 20-mph runs did not result in rib fracture, three of the four 40-mph runs did produce fractures. In contrast, rib fracture did occur among the Volvo occupants at speeds under 20 mph, but a lower percentage of living occupants received fractures at the higher speeds than did the cadavers. The authors also pointed out that the average number of ribs fractured per subject was much higher for the cadavers (5.6) than for the Volvo occupants (0.9) at BEV' s of 30 mph or more. Although age can be a factor, it was probably not significant here, the cadavers in this series ranging in age at death from 32 to 61 years. Despite the range of tolerance displayed in these as in other tests, the authors suggested that the threshold for cadaver rib fracture corresponded to a horizontal upper shoulder belt force of about 1000 lb. Fayon, Tarriere, et al. (42) also found that when adjusted for subject weight, the load on the thorax correlated fairly well (r = .71) with the number of rib fractures in 31 dynamic tests using three-point belted cadavers. The authors also showed that the relationship between deflection and injury is dependent on the rate of loading and on the nature of the load application (i.e., belt or disk impactor). The correlation between chest acceleration and injury was found to be poor. In the meantime, FMVSS 208 still used acceleration as the basis for the chest injury criterion for all automatic restraint systems, SI &lt;1000 also still being allowed as the "interim" criterion. Manufacturers requested that the SI be made permanent because it emphasized the importance of impact duration relative to injury tolerance and also, no doubt, because it was clearly a very generous criterion. NHTSA responded in July 1976 and, for administrative reasons, did propose to</page><page sequence="9">1982 R. L. HESS, ET AL. extend the SI into August 1977, which, by default, would reinstate the "reasonable" 60- g/3-ms criterion after that time for both frontal and lateral impact tests. The agency claimed that, "Two years of frontal and oblique crash testing involving 20 vehicles and 56 dummies supports this conclusion, in that no dummy recorded chest accelerations greater than 60 g for more than 3 milliseconds." In the same notice, NHTSA suggested that the lateral and rollover test requirements might be dropped if manual lap belts were supplied along with otherwise automatic systems. In August 1976, the extension to August 1977 was formally made, but other issues were left unresolved. At the 6th Experimental Safety Vehicles Conference, Eppinger(43) reported his analysis of 108 experimental impact tests with cadavers, restrained by three-point belt systems, that had been conducted in recent years. He found that the number of ribs fractured was a statistically significant function of cadaver weight, age at death, and maximum upper torso belt force. Using dimensional analysis to scale the weight factor and statistical analysis to account for age, a relationship between thoracic fractures and shoulder belt load was developed. This relationship was applied to the dri ver/passenger population for a 30-mph frontal barrier impact to derive an optimum load limit, given certain belt slack, that would minimize rib fracture. The optimum level for 2 inches of slack was 1300 lb., and for 3 inches of slack the level rose to 1500 lb. Eppinger also suggested that further analysis was needed to address the problem of life-threatening internal organ injuries. In December 1976, a notice was issued asking for comments as to how belt restraint systems could be improved. While indicating that injury criteria might be reinstated for manual belt systems, NHTSA suggested that an upper torso belt load limit might also be added. Foret-Bruno, Hartemann, et al. (44) were able to relate vehicle occupant injuries to shoulder belt loads, in frontal crashes involving Peugeot and Renault vehicles, because of an energy absorbing belt system in which several ribbons of fabric tear successively as the force increases. No rib fractures were received by occupants less than 30 years old under loads up to about 1630 lb. After age 50, however, fractures began to occur at about 950 lb. Comparing these results to Eppinger' s predictions of rib fractures in cadavers of the same ages, the authors found that cadavers could be expected to sustain from 3 to 5 more rib fractures than did the living occupant. GLOBAL APPROACHES TO THORACIC INJURY: 1976-1980 Investigations into thoracic injury tolerance and its measurable indicators had, until this time, concentrated on localized impacts to human surrogates instrumented with one or perhaps two sensing devices. A new approach, described by Robbins, Mel vin, and Stal naker(45) , used ten accelerometers located on the sternum, spine, and ribs at prescribed points around the thorax. This array of sensors allowed the measurement of the kinematic response of this flexible, ellipsoidal body, subject to blunt impact in various test modes and including different impact directions. From these acceleration measurements, the magnitude and velocity of deformations could be inferred. These data describing global thoracic motion would then be correlated with observed injuries. The system was designed to be usable both with cadavers and with dummies. The first series of experiments, reported by Robbins et al., were frontal impacts using 13 cadaver and 20 baboon subjects restrained by three-point belts, EA steering assemblies and/or airbags. AIS was used as the indicator of injury level, rather than number of fractures, because the former addressed the full range of thoracic injuries. Various combinations of anthropometric and accelerometer measurements were used to try to develop linear regression models that would predict injury levels. With the limited number of subjects and the many possible parameters, the modeling effort was not as successful as had been hoped. The baboon series, however, in which the subjects were more similar to each other, yielded better predictions than the cadaver series, the former having an average error of less than 0.13 AIS. Side impact experiments that followed the frontal impact series were reported by Mel vin, Robbins, and Stal naker(46) at the 6th Experimental Safety Vehicles Conference. These tests compared the kinematic response of cadavers to that of the Part 572 dummy and the British Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) side impact dummy. (The TRRL dummy had no arms; design details can be found in Harris(47).) The same ten-accelerometer system was used on the thoraxes of the seven cadavers, but the two dummies were instrumented according to Part 572 requirements. The subjects were seated sideways on the sled next to either a rigid wall structure or a padded, contoured surface representing a vehicle side interior. At impact, the subjects slid into these structures. The differences in whole-body kinematics were marked and were due primarily to the very compliant shoulder structures of the cadavers compared to the fairly rigid dummy structures. The visually obvious consequence of this difference was the response of the head/ neck system. The side of the cadaver heads impacted the wall with considerable force, while the dummy heads rotated laterally and barely touched the wall, if at all. Further implications were apparent, however, for determining thoracic injury potential, if indeed existing dummies did not deform as humans do. It was clear that these dummies were totally inappropriate for side impact testing. It should also be noted that, in the 20-mph lateral impact using the padded structure, the Part 572 dummy recorded a left-right acceleration of 102 g, while the cadaver recorded 19 g. In February 1977, NHTSA issued a rule that relaxed certain requirements for dummy thorax calibration. In the preamble to the rule, NHTSA claimed not to agree with criticism from vehicle manufacturers that "the dummy construction is</page><page sequence="10">OCCUPANT PROTECTION 19 8 3 unsuited to measurements of laterally-imposed force, thereby rendering the dummy unobjective in the lateral impact environment." The agency added, however, that NHTSA's current proposal to drop lateral and rollover tests if lap belts were used gave the manufacturers a way out. The rule allowing the lap belt in lieu of these dynamic tests was issued in July 1977, making the whole question of dummy lateral response characteristics "largely academic," according to NHTSA. The agency also addressed the industry's request that "the severity index be continued as the chest injury criterion until a basis for using chest deflection is developed in place of chest acceleration." It was further suggested that "a shift from the temporary severity index measure to the 60-g/3-ms measurement would be wasteful," because there was "no strong indication" that one was more meaningful than the other. NHTSA responded that the SI was only an indirect limit on acceleration and therefore allowed higher loads than did a direct limit on acceleration. The latter was considered to be a better injury predictor under specific test conditions. The 60-g/3-ms criterion was thus retained. In the following year, the criterion was also incorporated into a proposed revision of FMVSS 213 on child restraint systems, despite a lack of biomechanical tEst data to indicate its validity for children, and became part of the rule in December 1979. The Robbins series of frontal and side impact experiments with cadavers was increased to 51, the additional tests being primarily controlled frontal and lateral tests with a 51.5-lb. flat-faced impactor. For these tests, two additional accelerometers were added to the spinal locations. With these data, a new approach to injury-predictive modeling, using a non-linear Adaptive Learning Network (ALN) program, was tried and reported by Eppinger, Augustyn, and Robbins. (48) With the goal of eventually being able to duplicate as much of the kinematic response of cadavers as possible in a dummy structure, models were exercised with increasingly fewer parameters to reach an optimum set that might be mechanically feasible while still adequately predicting injury. Both AIS and number of ribs fractured were used as injury measures. The parameters chosen for analysis included measured accelerations, first and second integrals of these, and differences between accelerations at two points. Data from both frontal and lateral impacts were included, as well as cross-products of values for each to create "oblique" parameters. Age and sex were also used. The maximum number of parameters was 13, and, with the full set, high predictive capabilities were achieved for both AIS and rib fractures. However, the AIS model usigg only seven parameters was nearly as good (R = 91.1), and, for rib fractures, nine parameters were adequate (R = 94.6). It is interesting that age did not prove to be a significant variable, perhaps because the "structural response" parameters actually reflected the effects of age on injury potential. This modeling approach selected key parameters that could theoretically be used as a basis for designing and constructing a "universal" dummy with valid responses when impacted from any direction. A word of caution is in order, however, regarding the use of multiple acceleration measurements, their integrals, differences, and cross-products, to arrive at a known value (AIS). While it may be possible to achieve a reasonable end result, the relationships among parameters that the model must use to achieve these results may not themselves be reasonable. Further analysis may be needed to validate this approach. At the 7th Experimental Safety Vehicles Conference, Robbins, Lehman, and Augustyn(49) presented their analysis of only the lateral cadaver tests, both sled and flat impactor. To differentiate among the many subjects with identical AIS ratings, a modified AIS that introduced a rib fracture bias was proposed but not used in the final analysis. Some adjustments on data processing procedures were made, so that the first and second integrals of acceleration (similar to, but not exactly velocity and deformation, because the vector direction was not precisely known) could be more accurately calculated. Using regression techniques, injury prediction models were developed using various accelerai i on- based parameters. The first integral of the left upper rib acceleration (impact forces were on the left side) proved to hgve the highest correlation with injury (R = 0.778). Other significant parameters came from measurements on the right upper rib, the spine (laterally oriented accelerometers), and the lower sternum (accelerometer oriented perpendicular to impact). The authors concluded that, if the instrumentation system used in the cadaver tests were integrated into a dummy design, and if the dummy could exhibit the same responses as the cadavers at these accelerometer locations, it was reasonable to assume that this dummy could be used as a valid test device to predict injury. ATD' s based on this global approach and also on the load-deflection approaches, discussed in previous sections, have been developed and are currently being evaluated. These are the GM Hybrid III, based on the Lobdell corridors and described in Foster, Kortge, and Wolanin(50); the Association Peugeot-Renault (APR) dummy, based on load- deflection data of the Tarriere series and described in Stalnaker, Tarriere, et al. (51); and the HSRI Side Impact Dummy (SID), based on the acceleration data of the Robbins series and described in Melvin, Robbins, and Benson. (52) The Hybrid III is limited to frontal impact biofidelity, and the latter two were designed only for side impact testing. The omnidirectional ATD has yet to be attempted. REVIEW OF CLINICAL LITERATURE DEALING WITH THORACIC INJURY To provide some background on and insight into the mechanisms of actual thoracic injuries,</page><page sequence="11">1984 R* HESS, ET AL. clinical literature was selected and reviewed. Both keyword searches of the computerized records of the National Library of Medicine's National Interactive Retrieval System and traditional methods of library search were used. Approximately 200 articles were located and visually scanned for pertinence to this study. Of these, approximately forty were selected for further study. Intense review reduced this set to sixteen articles. (53 through 68) It may be useful to highlight the differences in approach between biomechanical and clinical literature in dealing with injury. The technical biomechanics literature has dealt with kinematic and kinetic responses of the thorax under impulsive, blunt loadings. Structural failure featured "fractured" ribs and "contused" or "lacerated" organs or vessels. The injury statistics from field cases are also described with similar combinations of terms from a few categories. Table 1 lists the categories and terms used. The clinical literature, on the other hand, is far more specific about injury type and location and does not lend itself to generalizations. Further, the authors of the clinical literature reviewed are not concerned about creating a statistical basis for analysis of injury types or degrees, but rather are primarily concerned with matters of diagnosis and treatment in order to reduce mortality and morbidity among those who reach medical treatment facilities. In addition, injuries generated in an automotive environment are often combined with non-automotive injury cases. Finally, this literature treats the development of secondary ailments triggered by the original trauma, an aspect of injury development that is largely absent from the biomechanics literature. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE THORAX ELEMENTS OF INTEREST - The thorax or chest, as referred to here, consists of the rib cage and the organs surrounded by it, but not the overlying tissue. Rib Cage - The cage structure consists of the twelve thoracic vertebrae, the sternum, and the twelve rib-pairs. The upper seven pairs articulate with the sternum directly through cartilaginous extensions of the ribs. The next two pairs articulate indirectly, and the lower three pairs are not connected to the sternum at all. The rib cage partially covers some of the upper abdominal organs. The diaphragm, a dome- shaped, thin muscle, is the lower thoracic boundary separating the thoracic and abdominal contents. Portions or all of the ribs from the seventh pair to the twelfth are thus well below the diaphragm and enclose, to a variable degree, the liver, stomach, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys. Lungs - The lungs are covered by a membrane (the visceral pleura) that quite closely fits the lungs' contours. Another membrane (the parietal pleura) lines the inner surface of the chest wall, covers the diaphragm, and encloses the structures in the middle of the thorax. These two sacs, left and right, are separate from each other. Each sac has potential space between the visceral and the parietal pleura that is known as the pleural cavity. Air or blood may fill this potential space when thoracic injury occurs. Mediastinum and Heart - The space between the right and left pleural sacs is known as the mediastinum. The mediastinum can be crudely pictured on a plane x-ray plate. Fluid filling this space leads to an observed "widening of the mediastinum," as seen on the plate, and serves as a primary diagnostic signal of possible Table 1 - Case Injury Descriptive Terms Injury Level Body Element Injury Type Direction Body Region None Skeletal Laceration Right Head Minor Vertebrae Contusion Left Face Moderate Joints Abrasion Bilateral Neck Severe Digestive Fracture Central Shoulder Serious Liver Pain Front Upper Extrem.

The bodies of the thoracic vertebrae extend into the mediastinum to approximately one-third of the thorax depth at the level of the heart and the great vessels. (These vessels are the pulmonary arteries (left and right), the pulmonary veins (left and right), the aorta, and the vena cava (superior and inferior). The inferior vena cava receives blood from the lower parts of the body and the superior from the head, neck, and upper extremities.) The heart is generally divided into four parts, the left and right atrium and ventricle parts. The heart is encased in a two-layered sac (the pericardium) . The inner membrane covers the outside of the heart and lines the inside of the fibrous outer sac. In general, the two layers of the sac are completely separate and form therefore a potential pericardial space. This sac also extends along the first inch of the great vessels. Fluid build-up in the pericardial sac will put pressure on the heart, constricting it and reducing cardiac output. This condition is referred to as a pericardial tamponade. A partial tracing of a plate illustrating the relative position of the above structures and organs at about the mid-height of the thorax is found as Figure 1. INJURY DESCRIPTIONS - Generally, we shall divide our discussion of thoracic injury among injury of the ribs, injury of the lungs, and injury of the heart. Rib fracture by itself was not included in the clinical literature reviewed, so this injury will not be discussed except to the extent that rib fracture can be used as a diagnostic indicator. Flail Chest - The flail chest is a condition of instability or flapping of the chest wall. This results in chest motion opposite to that occurring during normal breathing. The literature indicates that it is common for the flail chest either not to have developed by the time of first diagnosis in an emergency room, or to be missed in the emergency room diagnosis. Neither the existence of head injury or unconscious state nor the number of ribs fractured seems to differentiate between early and late flailing development. Although flail chest is directly related to trauma- induced instability of the thoracic cage, a change in pulmonary compliance due to airway injury, an accumulation of secretions, or artery-to-vein shunting due to lung contusions may develop in a few hours after the trauma and lead to increased effort in breathing. Oxygen levels in the arterial blood may fall below required levels, carbon dioxide tensions may I /1/ ' )ïhoracic( ff ' I V// ' '' Vertebren jļ ff I ' *y/ 'k _ ' /(( Thoracic AlT'5,h / ' ^/ÍÍ _ EsophagusJj^_^-J^ Aorta ''V ļ ^ ' Ills Visceral Pleura V. 1 ; V'/--; .-''-V I / ' W ^Parietal Pleura /'Bronchus' / ' I Bronchus.'

Tracheal injury or rupture may also be a contributing factor leading to the flail chest. The flail chest is not directly an injury in its own right and thus cannot be related to a specific class of blow other than blunt trauma to the front or side of the rib cage. As a matter of interest, immediate treatment requires placing a breathing tube into the airway and providing mechanical respiratory assistance. It is also generally advantageous for the surgeon to later cut an opening into the trachea to facilitate breathing. However important these treatments may be, the development of bacterial infection of the bronchial tubes, the trachae, or the lungs follows in the majority of cases. Furthermore, mechanically assisted ventilation causes pulmonary blood volume and left atrial pressure to decrease. In turn, there is a reflex of the vagus nerve that results in an increased release of an antidiuretic hormone, causing water retention and leading to pulmonary edema. LungXontusion - It appears that lung brui sing (contusion) occurs in over half of the cases having flail chests. Lung contusion commonly occurs in cases with no rib fracture and is also commonly associated with abdominal injury. Clinical evidence of lung contusion appears to be masked by the presence of rib fractures, air or blood in the pulmonary pleural cavity, collapse of a lung, or inflammation of the lungs due to sucking in of fluids. Lung contusion can be inferred in the second or third day after injury by blood gas studies. Comparison of the time history of the oxygen partial pressures between the air in the lung and the arterial blood provides a basis for the diagnosis of a contusion. In the absence of a contusion, the oxygen parti al -pressure difference will fall by the end of twenty-four hours, and in the presence of contusion it will rise to a large difference at about forty-eight hours after trauma. Lung contusion may double the probability of the development of pneumonia, which is said to be the most serious problem and most common cause of death in cases involving severe thoracic trauma, given survival beyond one to two days. The development of pneumonia prolongs the use of respirators and calls for increased oxygen levels (100% for prolonged periods). Oxygen toxicity added to pneumonia and contusion is considered uniformly fatal in its consequences. Further, the contused lung is more susceptible to simple "blowout." Lung contusion is also likely to lead to local areas being left airless with a resulting artery-to- vein shunting occurring and local pneumonitis. The shunting apparently leads to increased strain on the heart and an ultimate decrease in arterial oxygen. Hemothorax or Pneumothorax - The pleural cavity represents "potential" space. When blood or air enters this space, the situation is described as hemothorax or pneumothorax. The combined hemopneumothorax case also exists. Treatment is by entubing the area and often physically cutting into the cavity to remove clotted blood. In either the hemo- or pneumothorax case, it is important to prevent compression or collapse of the lung by draining the cavity. Neither is properly an "injury," although each is reported on both accident and medical reports. Original pneumothorax would most likely result from a fractured rib cutting through the pulmonary pleura. Late-developing pneumothorax seems to be the result of a "blowout" of the lung at a contused location when on mechanical respiratory assistance. Hemothorax could result from several different blood vessel injury locations. It need not be accompanied by rib fracture but usually occurs when vessels tear at the same time that adjacent ribs are fractured. Heart and Great Vessels - Contusion of the muscle wall of the heart frequently occurs in the same cases in which severe contusion of the lung(s) is found. Diagnosis at the time of admission is seldom made. Since oxygen shortage in the arterial blood would result from the lung injury and contribute to the ECG pattern characteri stic of reduced blood supply to the heart muscle, the heart contusion would not be distinguishable. Contusion of the heart is generally discovered at the time of autopsy. It is not considered a primary cause of death in the short run but does seem to add to the overall set of problems of a lung-injured case, sometimes in the form of oxygen shortage in the brain and cardiac arrest. Treatment for and the general course of heart muscle contusion are similar to those associated with myocardial infarction, except that coronary vasodilators and anticoagulants are of little benefit. Among heart injuries, rupture of the muscle wall is the lesion quite frequently found at autopsy following fatalities from nonpenetrating chest trauma. Rupture of the right ventricle is most common, followed by the left ventricle, the right atrium, and the left atrium. Survival is seldom over thirty minutes, and successful surgical treatment is rare. Survival long enough to reach a medical facility corresponds to the pericardial tamponade situations. Interventricular wall (septum) perforation is a less acute form of rupture. Congestive heart failure in the first two weeks is common if this rupture is not diagnosed and surgically repaired. Animal studies have suggested that this perforation is more likely when the blow is delivered late in the dilation of the ventricles or early in the contraction period. Late true aneurysm, i.e., the thinning or stretching of the heart's muscle wall, or late pseudoaneurysm, i.e., the dilation of an artery at a nearby site, are further complications of heart trauma. Morbidity and mortality are high in these instances. Heart valve rupture, particularly the left side aortic valve in people with pre-existing disease conditions, is not rare in blunt chest and abdominal trauma. Rapid progression of congestive heart failure in one or two years is the expected outcome of untreated cases. Pericardial disruption, the rending of the double layered sac containing the heart and the</page><page sequence="14">OCCUPANT PROTECTION 1987 beginning of the great vessels, is found in a significant portion of those cases examined at autopsy following blunt chest trauma. The tears are typically transverse and extend across the upper base of the heart near the reflection of the visceral (inner) and parietal (outer) pericardium. Naturally, such a tear in the presence of heart muscle injury and bleeding can produce fatal, gross loss of blood from the heart. Smaller tears may allow a sufficient tamponade to occur to control bleeding adequately and long enough to allow treatment. In the absence of pericardial rending of any great extent, the pericardium "potential" space may be filled with blood creating a cardiac tamponade with serious results. Surgical puncture of the pericardium and removal of this blood is required but is a dangerous procedure. An inflammatory reaction in the pericardium following blunt trauma is ordinarily well resolved. Aneurysms of the aorta are not uncommon among people suffering blunt thoracic trauma sufficient to cause bony injury and a widened mediastinum. Aortography is required to confirm the aneurysm. Aortic aneurysms appear to be associated most frequently with upper sternal and/or upper rib fractures. To physically visualize the aorta, consider this image. From the left ventricle, a single great vessel (the ascending aorta) rises upward. This vessel arches above the heart and then turns down, rearward, and to the left, becoming the thoracic aorta (the descending aorta). From the top of the arch of the aorta, the brachiocephalic trunk artery, the left common carotid artery, and the left subclavian artery arise. The brachiocephalic trunk branches in a few centimeters into the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries. The coronary arteries originate at the base of the ascending aorta. Ruptures of the aorta appear to occur in several regions. Because clinical literature is being reviewed, one must suspect that there is case selection being performed according to the author's specialty or interest, and one should not therefore accept sweeping statements that indicate preferred locations for rupture. However, it appears that the site of the rupture is ordinarily just distal (most outboard) to the left subclavian artery. It is estimated that only ten to twenty percent of thoracic aortic rupture cases live long enough for operative care to be achieved, and that even these cases often show few signs of external injury. OBSERVATIONS REGARDING THE CLINICAL LITERATURE ON THORACIC INJURY - The clinical literature on thoracic injury is very instructive. As far as a biomechanics-oriented reader is concerned, this literature does provide the basis for a mechanistic description of thoracic structure and an appreciation for its failures under blunt loading. This literature does not, however, directly establish any well-founded hypotheses regarding injury mechanisms or tolerances such as could be related to location, distribution, direction, or time history of external loading. It does serve to establish a background against which the biomechanics researcher might create hypotheses. It seems clear that greater levels of communication between field accident reporting and medical analysis of cases could establish the basis for laboratory practice devoted to generating a better connection between loading and injury. One must suspect that the health of local tissue prior to injury, as well as the traumatized person's overall health and reserve capacities, have a significant effect on susceptibility to injury. Furthermore, missed diagnoses of significant injuries, inadequate treatment capabilities, delayed outcomes of injury, and the general absence of autopsy of trauma fatalities seem to preclude descriptive statistics on detailed thoracic injury. FIELD CASE DATA Driver thoracic injuries in frontal crashes commonly involve contact between the thorax and the steering wheel. The development of distributed force on the thorax is reasonably assured in this situation. The driver's upper torso must receive an integrated, effective force-time input equivalent to the upper torso's momentum in order for the torso to come to rest. This impulse would be the net effect of the forces, consisting of the separate forces delivered through the connections of the neck, arms, and lower torso with the upper torso plus the force delivered by the hub-rim and spokes of the steering wheel. The loading distribution and time history of the thorax/steeri ng-wheel interaction is of interest in considering specific injuries of the thorax. The technical literature dealing with experimental frontal impacts to the human thorax has generally been restricted to situations in which the impulse has been delivered by a six- inch diameter impactor in the body's plane of symmetry and "normal to" the sternum, with the body in a seated position. There is a variety of evidence to indicate that a horizontal, center-plane impact by a six-inch diameter striker only poorly models the situations in which real crashes produce thoracic injury from steeri ng-wheel-del ivered impulses. This last comment is not a criticism of the research reported in the literature since, surely, standardized laboratory procedures are required in order to allow correlation of research done at different times and places. The comment is designed to suggest that a greater variety of test conditions will be required if the various injury mechanisms associated with impulsive steering wheel loading of the thorax are to be understood. Figures 2 and 3 are derived from data generated by the MVMA 2-D computer simulation of an occupant interacting with a vehicle interior during a frontal crash. The simulation used average values for all parameters of the vehicle and occupant and was run three times with only one parameter changed between runs. This parameter was the height of the steering wheel hub. The three values used were an average</page><page sequence="15">1988 R# L* HESS, ET AL.

Fig. 3 - Force on thorax as a function of steering wheel height</page><page sequence="16">OCCUPANT PROTECTION 1989 height and that height increased and decreased by 7 cm. The most significant observation is that altering this parameter did not have a gross effect on thoracic spinal deceleration (Figure 2) but did have a significant effect upon the level of force delivered to the thorax (Figure 3). The explanation for these two aspects of the data lies in the detail of the data tables. Raising or lowering the steering assembly relative to the occupant results in some of the load normally delivered directly to the thorax being taken by the head or abdomen. This force is still, however, delivered indirectly to the thorax by way of the neck or mid-torso. Thus, even though the direct force input to the thorax from the steering assembly is higher for the mid-mount height than for the high or low mounts, the deceleration of the thoracic spine for all three heights remains about the same. Thus one finds support in this data for an argument that, all other parameters being the same, the thoracic injury outcome of similar real-world crashes should depend upon the height of the driver's thorax relative to the steering wheel at the moment of interaction in a crash. This relative height can of course be affected by the driver's sitting posture and thus may be difficult to ascertain. In addition to thorax/steering-wheel relative height, there are several other factors that seem important. We have inferred that the vertical component of the impulsive force on the thorax may be significant and thus a factor to be considered in accident investigation. NHTSA has had a relatively large number of barrier crashes of automobiles performed in connection with enforcement of FMVSS 204, "Steering Control Rearward Displacement." Data have been extracted from Kahane(69) relative to the vertical movement of the hub of the steering assembly during a barrier crash. Figure 4 (a through p) shows these data for sixteen domestic 1975-76 vehicles plotted as functions of time. These figures should be viewed with the understanding that the time interval from 75 to 100 ms is the interval during which the driver's thorax would be loaded longitudinally by the column. Upward or downward movement of the steering hub during a time interval involving strong longitudinal thoracic loading should be presumed to deliver an associated upward or downward shear type of thoracic loading. Several vehicles from this collection appear to be candidates for such shear- type loading. The vertical line on each of these plots indicates the approximate time at which the hub reversed its fore and aft motion relative to the undisturbed occupant compartment. To study thorax/steering-wheel interaction in actual crashes, two data files were accessed: the National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) and the Huelke/Sherman team cases from the University of Michigan Vehicle Occupant Report (UMIVOR). These files were searched for cases in which 1) the injured occupant was the driver; 2) the crash was frontal and, for car-to-car crashes, a barrier equivalent velocity could be estimated; 3) the injury was to the thorax; (4) the contact related to the injury was the steering wheel; and 5) photographs of the steering wheel had been included. The UMIVOR file contains two variables that appeared to be related to the thorax/steeri ng-wheel interaction. These variables describe spoke damage and rim damage, each with a 0-3 damage scale defined by the words "none," "deformed slightly," "severely bent," and "broken." A review of NCSS case photographs of steering wheels by a trained investigator from the UMIVOR team provided values for these two variables for each NCSS case. These two variables were summed creating a total steering wheel disruption (TSWD) parameter. The sums were then used as symbols on plots showing thorax AIS versus barrier equivalent velocity (BEV). Figures 5 and 6 display the results for 41 NCSS cases and 32 UMIVOR cases respectively. Each figure displays the expected relationship of thoracic injury to BEV, i.e., that an increase in BEV is predictive, although poorly, of an increase in thorax AIS values. Note that TSWD values of 0 or 1 are associated with BEV 's of less than 17 mph. The NCSS data in Figure 5 contain 5 of 41 cases with a thorax AIS of 1, while the UMIVOR data in Figure 6 contain 23 of 32 with a thorax AIS of 1. If AIS 1-2 is used for comparison, the corresponding numbers are 14 of 41 for NCSS and 26 of 32 for UMIVOR. Thus the NCSS data set has 27 of 41, or 66 percent, of its cases at the thorax AIS of 3 or more, while the UMIVOR data set has 6 of 32, or 19 percent, of its cases in that severity range. In the NCSS cases, 7 of 41 are at BEV of less than 17 mph, while in the UMIVOR cases, 15 of 32 cases are at BEV of less than 17 mph. The UMIVOR cases are, on average, far less severe than the NCSS cases. With regard to the NCSS data, higher AIS values, higher BEV values, and higher TSWD codes do go together. This is not direct evidence that the nature of the steering wheel disruption is responsible for the nature or degree of injury. The higher injury levels tend to be lacerative in nature, however, and higher TSWD values do indicate that stronger gradients of thoracic deformation might have occurred. Thus a hypothesis of a relationship is not without a basis of support. Table 2 contains an index of NCSS cases examined in detail along with a summary of injury-related data. All cases are of the driver/car-to-car/front-crush type. Figures 7, 8, and 9 present correlations of the thorax AIS values for these cases with computed DOT CRASH2 velocity changes, barrier equivalent velocity changes, and peak deceleration based upon CRASH2-developed forces respectively. The correlation coefficients are between 0.4 and 0.5. Table 3 contains a summary of the regression relationship between the DOT CRASH2 velocity change and thorax AIS for drivers and right- front- seat occupants in a variety of crash formats. Case indexes and correlation sketches for each occupant/crash type, other than the one discussed above, can be found in Appendix C of report UM-HSRI-81-38 previously referenced.

The index of the NCSS cases examined has been repeated in that appendix, along with a set of computer- generated case- report sketches. These sketches were included to provide readers who do not have a readily available means of using the original data files with a fuller understanding of the field cases. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Selected sets of scientific and clinical literature, regulatory background, and case studies dealing with automobile occupants' thoracic injuries during automobile crashes have been reviewed. The bulk of the reported research on the engineering characteristics of the human thorax under blunt, impulsive loading is concentrated on the force-time, force- deflection, and deflection-time histories of the thorax, with the loading being delivered by cylindrical strikers in the central plane and normal to the sternum. Significant biodynamic testing has been done under side impulsive loading with multiple accelerometer locations on the bony thoracic cage. Predictions of injury, on the AIS scale, have been made based upon relative sternum- spi nal deflections or sternal loading, as well as upon rib fracture in central plane human cadaver studies. Also, predictions of injury, in the case of lateral loading, have been developed based upon combinations of signals, and the time integrals of signals, from the thoracic bony cage instrumentation. Most commonly, in the case of human cadavers, rib fracture has played a prominent part in injury predictions, i.e., in predicting the injury a living human would receive under similar loading. The research literature relating to automotive crash blunt thoracic loading does not deal to any the great extent with injury to the lungs, great vessels of the thorax, or the heart. Research relative to the mechanisms of the development of contusions, aneurysms, or tearing of the lungs, great vessels, or heart is generally absent in the literature. Research dealing with the influence of the geometry of impactors and/or with variations in the relative height, centerline offset, or angle of the delivered impulse is particularly absent. Field studies of crashes have produced only a small fraction of cases that can be even roughly modeled to predict the linear or angular time history of the crashing vehicle. These field studies have almost uniformly ignored the probable positioning of the occupant's thorax relative to vehicle landmarks, such as the steering wheel hub or the upper instrument panel's surface in frontal crash cases. The result of these two circumstances is the almost total inability to infer the general nature of the impulsive loading on an occupant's thorax. This general inability is compounded by the known or predictable sensitivity of injury to local force or local deformation patterns. Two broad recommendations follow from this study. First, detailed laboratory human cadaver impact studies should be carried out under protocols that allow insight into the contusions and lacerations of the lungs, the great vessels of the thorax, and the heart, under conditions in which both the impactor shape and impact location and angle are varied. Associated live surrogate testing would be required to allow study of the living system's reaction to contusions and lacerations. Second, intensive efforts to devise means of accurately reconstructing the pre-crash relative position of the occupant's thorax as well as the occupant- vehicle kinematics and kinetics should be undertaken. Motion of the vehicle elements contacted by the thorax during a crash should be given particular attention. REFERENCES 1. L. L. Ricci, ed, "NCSS Statistics: Passenger Cars."
