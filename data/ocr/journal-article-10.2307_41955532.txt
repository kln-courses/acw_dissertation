From a metaphorical reference to shikisen (an augury using astrological calculations and an augury instrument called shikiban ), to a type of magical curse, to a supernatural being, the various explanations offered by Japanese scholars highlight the ambivalent nature of shikigami and demonstrate the difficulties in establishing the exact nature of this enigmatic being. Although such variations in definition are a result of changing textual constructions of shikigami in Japanese classical literature, literary narratives still function as a useful source of social and cultural studies of early Japanese society. Through my study of shikigami , I seek to highlight the significance of Onmyõdõ in Japa- nese religiosity and provoke further studies in Japanese folklore beliefs while examining the use of literary narratives in religious studies. keywords: Japanese religion- Japanese literature- Onmyõdõ- Izanagi-ryû- folklore beliefs - shikigami Carolyn Pang is a PhD candidate in premodern Japanese literature in the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures, Columbia Unviersity. 99</page><page sequence="2">SHiKiGAMi ing nature figures of Japanese (Ätt, in the also traditions religions, written of and as Onmyõdõ Hcffl considering or fêfêlÂ. in its some irregular In view texts) of appearances the are syncretic fascinat- in SHiKiGAMi ing figures in the traditions of Onmyõdõ fêfêlÂ. In view of the syncretic nature of Japanese religions, and considering its irregular appearances in diaries and literature, shikigami are easily identified as an emblem of Onmyõdõ, specifically with aspects concerning thaumaturgy. There are no written records of this enigmatic entity within Onmyõdõ and so there are few explicit descrip- tions, much less explanations, for the presence of shikigami. As shown by the myriad depictions of shikigami in various guises in anime , manga, video games, dramas, and movies, the contemporary mass media has benefitted from this notable lack of detail. In contemporary times shikigami are commonly identified as a spirit servant controlled by the practitioners of Onmyõdõ, the onmyõji fêHrËûî (yin-yang mas- ter). This is a marked change from its early manifestations in Japanese classi- cal literature as an amorphous augury tool. My initial attempts to uncover the meanings embodied in shikigami took me on a literary analysis of its descrip- tions in premodern Japanese texts. Its literary descriptions revealed its char- acteristics to be rather eclectic and encompassing in nature, having possibly undergone cross-influences from other Japanese religions, but also as a result of the nature in which it had arisen: shikigami are attributed as a manifestation of the shikisen Äi" (see below). Although gradual changes in literary descriptions of shikigami seemingly paralleled the historical developments in Onmyõdõ, the narratives provide only a glimpse of its characteristics without detailing its role in Onmyõdõ. Many questions remain about what shikigami are, and what its functions are. Although shikigami have become an almost staple accompaniment to con- temporary portrayals of Onmyõdõ, particularly those involving the famous onmyõji Abe no Seimei žMpfBi (921-1005), 1 it is important to examine how understanding shikigami can help us learn more about Onmyõdõ. An overview of the literature on shikigami shows variations in the way it is described through the centuries, which has resulted in diverse understandings about this entity in contemporary Japanese scholarship. As Japanese scholars have employed differ- ent literary texts and time periods for analysis, this has produced varied and 1. Abe no Seimei was a famous historical figure who served six emperors, from Emperor Suzaku (r. 930-46) to Emperor Ichijõ - ^ (r .986-1011), as onmyõji. There are numerous legends about his magical prowess and his miraculous exploits are recorded in many classical literary texts, kabuki and jõruri plays, movies, and dramas.

An absolutist assumption of the immutability of shikigami beliefs and the abridgement of time overlooks the differing texts and periods of analysis and this often results in different defini- tions of shikigami. Therefore it is necessary to provide an idea of how shikigami were initially perceived in early Japanese beliefs before I introduce prevalent conceptions of shikigami in contemporary scholarship. I do not claim to have successfully escaped from this historical limitation but I hope that by paralleling the scholastic definitions with changing literary descriptions of shikigami , I can somewhat map out the often confusing definitions and ease the way towards an understanding of what shikigami mean for Japanese religiosity. Early Forms of Shikigami The mid-Heian work Makura no sõshi (1001-1002; see snkbz, vol. 18) by Sei Shõnagon (966?-after 1017) is one of the few early Japanese texts to mention shikigami. An episode in the chapter titled "When I first went into court ser- vice"2 describes Empress Teishi (áĚžŤ, 976-1000) asking Sei Shõnagon if she was fond of her, when a sudden loud sneeze from the Table Room interrupted the reply. As the sneeze occurred when the author was giving her answer, the empress jested that it was a sign that she was lying to her and left, leaving the young, inexperienced Sei Shõnagon greatly dismayed by this episode and bit- terly resentful of the person whose sneeze had cast doubt on the sincerity of her words. Later, during an exchange of letters with Empress Teishi, Sei Shõnagon expressed that shikigami ( shiki-no-kami could attest to her honesty and loyalty. In an attempt to convince the empress, she proclaimed her inability to lie due to the fear that shikigami would easily reveal the deception by reporting to Empress Teishi on the truthfulness of her words. In the context of their letter exchange, Empress Teishi had referred to tadasu- no-kami god of Tadasu), a sacred augury forest of the Shimogamo Shrine that was believed to be able to verify truths, to tease Sei Shõnagon about whether she would be able to maintain any lie when faced with the augury of truth. Sei Shõnagons written reply to the empress cleverly used the term shiki-no-kamiy another term for shikisen-no-kami god of the shikisen), to form a par- allel reference between the two augury tools of Tadasu IL and shikisen ÄÄ,a form of augury that onmyõji specialized in that is based on complex calculations using dates, times, and symbolic astrological signs, to emphasize the depth of her sincerity. She expressed her belief in the divination abilities of the shiki-no-kami to reveal the truth in response to the empress's mention of tadasu-no-kami. This 2. The original title is "Miya ni hajimete mairitaru koro" ('S ž h *9 fzh Z. ò). The translated title was taken from McKinney 2006, 173.</page><page sequence="4">102 I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 40/1(2013) comparison of shikigami with the augury tool of Tadasu suggests that shikigami beliefs among the aristocratic class during the mid-Heian period associated it with an augury tool rather than a supernatural force or immanent being. The open use of shikigami as a means of oath-swearing in the interaction between Sei Shõnagon and Empress Teishi indicate that shikigami was already a familiar concept that existed in the Heian Imperial Court during the early eleventh century. The lack of explanation of shikigami in Sei Shõnagons written reply to Empress Teishi was based on the premise of a shared and implicit under- standing of what it was. Makura no sõshi presents a positive image of shikigami as an all-knowing perceptive force that could observe happenings, give reliable reports of events, and even distill truth from lies. In Shöyüki (dnk, vols. 1-11), a diary of the Heian court official Fujiwara no Sanesuke (957-1046) who recorded various events from 978-1032, we get another perspective on shikigami , where it is blamed for the troubles of humans.3 In Chapter 20, "Extraordinary events, part 10" ( Rinji-jü Ks¡0$+), the entry titled "Officials" ( Shinka ET) within the section "Troubles" ( On-nayamukoto ííPlíW) records that the Minister of the Left, Fujiwara no Michinaga, was troubled with illness by a shikigami in the second year of the Chõhõ era [1000]): [Chõhõ era, second year, fifth month] Same year, same month, eighth day, it is said that a shikigami was the cause of the Minister of the Lefts troubles.4 This concise entry was recorded together with numerous documentation of illnesses and troubles suffered by the Imperial family and aristocrats. Unlike the majority of entries that briefly noted that an individual had trouble ( nayamu koto 1SV), or a few entries attributing the causes of illnesses to common reasons or the mischief of evil demons and vengeance of wrathful spirits, in this particu- lar entry it was stated that a shikigami was the cause of the minister s ill health. Instead of a reference to an augury tool as suggested in Makura no sõshi , Shöyüki highlights a different aspect of shikigami where it is a cause of illness and trouble. Shin-sarugakuki is a fictional work by Fujiwara no Akihira (989-1066) that was completed in 1052. It describes the principal occupations of the period in detail and is perceived as the predecessor of the later genre of õrai-mono (textbooks). It is regarded as an important literary contribution to the history of Japanese customs, theater, and performances, with Marian Ury describing this work as presenting the "principal occupations of the time and their vocabulary 3. Shöyüki is regarded as an important source of historical information about court ceremo- nies and the political and social environment during the regencies of Fujiwara no Michinaga Ubílil (966-1027) and Fujiwara no Yorimichi HHKÜii (992-1074). 4. The translation is mine. For the original Japanese tale, I have referred to the version pub- lished in Shin-sarugakuki.</page><page sequence="5">pang: the spirit SERVANT OF ONMYÕDÕ I 103 with encyclopedic thoroughness" (Ury 1999, 385). The descriptive commentary about various artisans and performers of the time illustrates a vivid picture of the social environment in the late Heian period. In the chapter titled "The tenth occupation, onyõ" ( Jükiminobu onyõ the abilities of an onmyõji , Kamo no Michiyo ÄScüffi, were recorded in detail as shown in the translation below: The tenth occupation is an onmyõji by the name of Kamo no Michiyo. . . who was able to freely summon the twelve guardian deities, call thirty-six types of wild birds to his side, control shikigami , create spells and talismans, open and close the eyes of kijin [Att; demon gods], and manipulate human souls.5 The awe over the legendary magical abilities of onmyõji was carefully pre- sented by Fujiwara no Akihira, who listed Kamo no Michiyos expert augury knowledge and formidable command over various elements such as wild beasts, deities, supernatural beings, and humans in the tale. The description that Michiyo was able to command shikigami suggests that this was one of the magical abilities that a highly- skilled onmyõji was expected to possess. The close relationship between the onmyõji and shikigami that is seen here is reiterated in later tales about onmyõji , such that shikigami eventually became an indispens- able existence in most legends of Onmyõdõ. Although the exact function of shikigami cannot be ascertained here, the separate categorization of shikigami from deities, kijin, humans, wild beasts, and even spells, suggests that it had a more specific purpose that the other entities did not fulfill. Shikigami as a Metaphorical Reference to Shikisen In view of the primary duties of the onmyõji as a master of divination since the Heian period, Japanese scholars such as Suzuki (1998; 2001; 2002), Murayama (2002), Toyoshima (2002), Suwa (2000), and Saitõ Tsutomu (2007) have sug- gested an association of shikigami with the augury tool of shikisen ÄÄ. Suwa Haruo points out that it was the eighth-century book Yõrõ ritsuryõ that set the regulations and duties of the Onmyõryõ, and that one of the Onmyõryõ s duties was senzei This is a form of augury using augury sticks and prin- ciples based on the Book of Changes ( 1-Ching ; Suwa 2000, 73). Court onmyõji were regarded as responsible for the tasks of augury and predictions that subse- quently augmented their image as diviners. During the Heian period, an onmyõji was often consulted in the event of a ke (# or 'fi$, strange occurrence), where he used shikisen to determine if the 5. The translation is mine. For the original Japanese tale, I have referred to the version pub- lished in Kawaguchi 1983, 132.</page><page sequence="6">104 I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 40/1(2013) unusual occurrence held further implications. Onmyõji specialized in shikisen , particularly the rikujin- shikisen TaÍÂã, a type of complex augury calculation that was said to have been introduced into Japan during the late sixth to early seventh century. Shikisen was widely used by practitioners of Onmyõdõ in the Nara period until the mid-sixteenth century where it was replaced by ekisen Ju è, a type of augury calculation derived from the Book of Changes (Yamashita 2004, 64-66). During the shikisen session, a specific device called the shikiban Ääf, which is also alternatively known as chokuban, is used. This is an elabo- rate instrument comprised of two attached rotating panels, with one round panel called tenban (Heaven panel) placed on top of a square panel called jiban iÉifi (Earth panel). Both panels have twelve cardinal points; those on the Heaven panel are referred to as the jüni-gatsushö (twelve guardians of the months), and those on the Earth panel the jüni-shi (twelve signs of the East Asian zodiac). The Heaven panel is usually rotated during augury cal- culations. In order to derive the final meaning of the reading, the jüni-gatsushö and the jüni-shi have to be carefully coordinated through mathematical calcula- tions to match the dates and times with the symbolic astrological signs. Onmyõji would then use the result to ascertain if the ke had any detrimental effects and advise what actions should be taken to alleviate them. With the comment that a shikigami shares the same first Chinese character Ä as shikisen , Suzuki claims that shikigami is actually a shiki-no-kamu or "kami of the shikisen 9 (god of the shikisen ) (Suzuki 1998, 61-62). The idea of shikigami as a deified representation of shikisen is supported by Murayama Shûichi, who argues that the chokuban was regarded as a sacred spiritual object ( shinsei misare reibutsu) that shaped ideas of shikigami as a spiritual entity (Murayama 2002, 16). Murayama also points out that the two shikigami that Abe no Seimei was fabled to command are a symbolic representation of the chokuban s Heaven and Earth panels. Suwa gives more details about the close relationship between shikigami and shikisen by explaining that the twelve shinshõ (guardian deities or war- rior gods) that legend claims Seimei commanded were likely based on the twelve cardinal points on the chokuban s Earth panel that relate to the jüni-shi. Although jüni-shi do not possess a clear identity, they were given characteristics of divinity in Onmyõdõ and existed as shugojin tF fîtt (guardian gods or protector spirits) that were often invoked during rites (Suwa 2000, 74-75). Suzuki sees ke as an important factor in the association of shikigami with shikisen, taking examples from historical diaries such as Shöyüki , Teishinkõki (907-948; DNK, vol. 1), and Midõkanpakuki (995-1021; dnk, vols. 1-3) to illus- trate the broad and varied definitions of ke. Ke might first appear as commonplace, nondescript occurrences such as a crow dropping its excrement on someone, and it required a knowing eye to recognize the deeper implications behind such inci- dences. Ke became a matter of high importance, especially within the aristocratic</page><page sequence="7">PANG: THE SPIRIT SERVANT OF ONMYÕDÕ | IO5 class since unusual occurrences were believed to portend cautionary signs for the future and possibly influence the general populaces perception towards the rul- ing class. As the augury skills of onmyõji were regarded as vital in interpreting the meanings embodied in ke , aristocrats often consulted onmyõji during times of ke occurrences for augury advice on the appropriate action to take to counter the possible negative effects of ke. Suzuki emphasizes that ke is a sign of forthcoming calamity, not the disaster itself, and shikigami act as the trigger to bring atten- tion to ke , while shikisen works to interpret the signs given by ke and unveil the meanings in it. In this aspect, shikigami becomes a personified embodiment of an onmyõji s ability in identifying the ke and his remarkable powers of prediction (Suzuki 1998, 60). The close link between shikigami and ke is demonstrated in Uji shüi mono- gatari (snkbz, vol. 50), a mid-Kamakura work consisting of a collection of a hundred and ninety-seven assorted tales and said to be completed in the period 1213-1221 by an anonymous compiler. In Tale 26, scroll 2, titled "Seimei sealing the young Archivist Minor Captains curse,"6 Seimei witnessed a crow dropping bird excrement on a popular chamberlain and quickly deduced that it was the setting of a shikigami curse. Finding it a pity that the chamberlain should die, Seimei decided to save the young man by laying protective spells around him throughout the night. The tale ended with Seimei successfully saving the cham- berlain by causing the deadly curse to retaliate and kill the spell-caster instead. It was later revealed that the curse was initiated by the jealous brother-in-law of the chamberlain who desired his death. In this episode, the corporeality of shikigami is in the physical form of a crow that sets a curse by dropping bird excrement on the chamberlain. The coincidence of a passing bird whose excre- ment happened to land on the chamberlain is imbued with critical significance due to the association of this unusual happening with the concept of ke. Seimei s remarkable skills in recognizing and deciphering ke is reiterated in Tale 184, scroll 14, section 10 of Uji shüi monogatari titled "The Hõjõ-ji, Minis- ters white dog, Seimei and other miraculous events."7 The tale describes the inci- dent where Fujiwara no Michinaga was on his daily visit to Hõjõ-ji (ft ÖCtP) when his favorite pet, a white dog, started running around in front of his carriage and bit the hem of his robe to prevent him from entering the temple precincts. Michinaga was concerned with this unusual incident and summoned Seimei, 6. The translation is mine. The original title is Seimei, Kuraudo no shõshõ 0 fuzuru koto which Tyler (2002) has translated simply as "The Genie," which I think is too succinct. Tyler s use of the term "genie" could also overlook the actual functions and meanings of shikigami by imposing cultural attributes embodied in the foreign concept of "genie" on shikigami. 7. The original title is Midõkanpaku oinu, seimei-ra, kidoku-no koto mm.</page><page sequence="8">io6 I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 40/ 1 (2013) who used his augury skills to divine the ke presented by the dog s strange behav- ior. After a few minutes of augury calculations, Seimei was able to ascertain that a curse was intentionally buried along the road to harm Michinaga and even accurately locate the burial site of the curse. The extraordinary ability of Seimei to recognize and interpret ke due to his augury knowledge is presented in the two tales; the tales also serve to highlight the close relationship between ke and the onmyõjis role as diviner. The association of shikigami with augury predictions is repeated in Genpeijõsuiki , a late fourteenth to early fifteenth century collection of military tales that consists of forty-eight scrolls. In scroll 12, titled "The Empress's Birth" ( Chügu o-san fflJjli), the wife of Taira no Kiyomori ^ (1118-1181), Tokiko Nfť (1126-1185), went to Ichijõ-modori Bridge in the Heian capital to consult fortunes using hashiura Si,a form of augury where fortunes are revealed by listening to the conversation of passersby on the bridge. After arriv- ing at the bridge, a group of twelve children with bobbed hair and of fourteen to fifteen years of age appeared from the west, clapping their hands and uttering a prophecy in unison. They later disappeared into the east. The twelve children were believed to be shikigami , as described in this translated excerpt: Ichijõ-modori Bridge was said to be where Abe no Seimei, the greatest in the knowledge of astrology and able to command the twelve guardian deities, had used incantations to seal the twelve deities jüni-shin] under the bridge and summoned them when needed as his wife feared the appearance of shikigami. If one consults ones fortune at the bridge [using the hashiura or bridge augury], shikigami will utter the fortune through the mouths of pass- ersby. Hence, the twelve children must be manifestations of the twelve guard- ian deities! [^^W'%J'tM1~)^^y-&gt;jüni-shinshö no kagen narubeshi].8 Matsuo Ashies annotation for this tale defines the twelve guardian deities as "divine followers of the Yakushi Nyorai" ( Yakushi nyorai no kenzoku) and states that they also refer to the "twelve guardian deities of the twelve hours of day and night" ( chüya-jüniji no gohõ-shin).9 In the tale, the twelve children shikigami were aware of Tokiko s identity and even hinted at her high status in their prophecy. This awareness of their current surroundings and ability to identify individu- als reiterates early beliefs about shikigami being well-informed about everything as expressed in Makura no sõshi, and emphasize shikigami s possible origin as a metonymy of shikisen. The close association of shikigami with shikisen augury and the shikiban instrument gives a reason for shikigami s link with hashiura. 8. The translation is mine.

He gave several examples of shikigami läctt in Buddhist texts, such as Bosatsushotaikyõ (t vol. 12, no. 384), which defined it as an anthropo- morphic realization of the active psychological or mental state (shiki, ftt; Suzuki 1998, 54). Suzuki is one of the few Japanese scholars in the field of Onmyõdõ research to attempt the study of the origins of shikigami , and his early efforts to identify the source of shikigami take the approach of examining examples from Konjaku mongatari shü (1120; see snkbz, vol. 37) and Uji shüi monogatari. He uses the religious backdrop of the two anthologies of tales to present the idea that shikigami was conceived from a Buddhist term describing a physical manifestation of a psychological state. Suzuki (2001) seeks to expound his definition of shikigami by relating it to Buddhist concepts of consciousness and Japanese beliefs in spirit possession such as tsukimono (spirits of animals, objects, or other lower beings that possess humans). His reference to Buddhist ideas of consciousness is meant to reveal the abstract and psychological aspects of shikigami , while the comparison with Japanese spirit possession is intended to identify the physical and behavioral aspects. To establish the origins of shikigami , Suzuki did an etymological examination of the meanings embodied in the different Chinese characters used to repre- sent shikigami. He listed and grouped the different Chinese characters used in Japanese classical texts and concluded that the Chinese character Ä was initially used in the early Heian period but was later interchangeably used with Wi in ref- erence to shikigami. As mentioned in the previous section, Suzuki is one of the few Japanese scholars who speculates that the use of Ä was initially intended as a metaphorical allusion to onmyõji s mastery over shikisen (Suzuki 2001, 28-29). After a study of the religious background of Konjaku mongatari shü and com- parisons with Buddhist texts to examine the meanings behind Hfc, Suzuki sur- mises that despite referring to the same entity in Onmyõdõ, the use of fjfefl to represent shikigami suggests that it is later viewed as a form of anima rather than augury abilities. Suzuki proposes that IScíí is a collateral existence produced by the active psyche which possesses autonomous control over the consciousness (líSc, shiki). The concept of shikigami as a type of spontaneous energy or vital force produced by the active psyche resulted in an anthropomorphic treatment of it. This meant that the symbolic role of shikigami as the indispensable aid to onmyõji is effectively a narration of the onmyõji s personified will and conscious- ness (Suzuki 2001, 36). Suzuki claims that shikigami s position as a metonymy of the onmyõji s will, consciousness, and knowledge explains why descriptions</page><page sequence="10">io8 I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 40/1(2013) of shikigami in classical Japanese literary texts are often portrayed as invisible to the human eye. In this context, he interprets the encounter between Seimei and the Harima onmyõji Chitoku in a tale in Konjaku mongatari shü as a com- petition of mental strength rather than magical skills. Konjaku mongatari shü is a collection of more than a thousand tales by an anonymous author that is speculated to have been completed in 1120. Described by Joseph Kitagawa as "probably the most valuable source regarding the reli- gious beliefs and practices of the masses during the Heian period" (1990, 83), the majority of the tales deal with Buddhist philosophical teachings, experiences of divine wonders, and karmic causality. The tale, "The tutelage of Abe no Seimei under Tadayuki, Tale 16" 10 records the episode where Seimei was challenged by an old monk, Chitoku from Harima.11 When Chitoku arrives at Seimei s abode on the pretext of paying a visit, he is accompanied by two young pages who Seimei immediately guesses are shikigami intending to test his capability. Seimei decides to conceal the boys with incantations and mudra hand signs as punish- ment for the monks insolence. When Chitoku leaves after Seimei asks him to revisit another day, he is alarmed to discover that his pages have disappeared and quickly goes back to apologize to Seimei and ask for their return. The epi- sode ends with Chitoku being highly impressed with Seimei s magical abilities and requesting to become his disciple. Konjaku mongatari shü provides a more definite image of shikigami , where it is able to take on a human physical form with a degree of realism that can deceive unknowing people into believing that it is real. There are no visible signs to verify the existence of shikigami at first sight and even Seimei, who is renowned for his impressive magical skills and knowledge, had to verify his sus- picions with the use of incantations. From this excerpt, it is shown that chants and hand signs are needed to manipulate shikigami , and the knowledge of such magic allows for the control and possession of shikigami. The use of chants and hand signs as a method to control supernatural forces suggests influences from Buddhism or Chinese Daoism. Suzuki argues that shikigami is a literary representation of Chitokus will and psychological intention to assess Seimeis capabilities (Suzuki 1998, 54). When Chitoku faced Seimei, competitive desire overtook him and weakened his state of mind, causing him to lose sight of his original intention. As such, he lost con- trol over his will, his " shikigami ," which allowed Seimei to overcome and "con- io. The original title is "Abe no Seimei, Tadayuki ni shitagaite michi o naraukoto daijùroku" Tyler has translated it as "The Test" (2002), based on a similar tale in Uji shüi monogatari. 11. See Tale 19 in Konjaku monogatari shü , "Harima-no-kuni onmyõji chitoku-hõshi no koto dai-jûkyu ' where the monks name was Chitoku.</page><page sequence="11">PANG: THE SPIRIT SERVANT OF ONMYÕDÕ I 109 ceal" his shikigami. In other words, Seimei and Chitoku s battle of wits is actually a struggle of control over ones own will and desire. Suzuki s concept of shikigami as a form of human cognitive power is a fascinating interpretation that high- lights a psychological approach towards the study of shikigami and suggests a possible influence of Buddhism on Onmyõdõ philosophical ideas since the late Heian period. Shikigami as a Type ofUtilizable Energy In the latter part of "The Tutelage of Abe no Seimei under Tadayuki, Tale 16," the command of shikigami and the legendary powers of Seimei are given in more detail in an anecdote of his visit to Prelate Kuwanten ÍlIíHUIE12 of the Hirosawa area where he is asked by a monk if he keeps shikigami and whether he can kill a man easily. In this account, Seimei admits that there are limitations to an onmyõji s power whereby it is difficult to kill a human with magic despite the possibility of doing so. He then proceeds to display his extraordinary skills with a blade of grass that is powerful enough to instantly crush a frog. Seimei s mastery of shikigami is emphasized in the next section of the tale that states that Seimei is said to employ the use of shikigami for simple household chores and describes the situation in his house where shutters lower and rise and doors close when there are no humans around. The concept of shikigami as a form of energy that can be tapped from existing natural elements is derived from literary descriptions of onmyõji conjur- ing shikigami from specific objects or animals, such as the case of Seimei using a leaf to kill a frog. Examples of shikigami as a form of utilizable energy can be found in Toyoshima Yasukuni s detailed glossary of Onmyõdõ terms that describes shikigami as a kakyü-no-reitekisonzai (low-ranking spiritual exis- tence) that is commanded by onmyõji and usually conjured from human-shaped items made from paper or grass, or animals such as dogs or foxes (Toyoshima 2002, 137). In Suwas examination of the historical context behind the legends of Seimei, he takes literary examples from texts such as Shin-sarugakukU Uji shüi monoga- tari , Genpeijõsuiki , and Okagami (mid-eleventh to early-twelfth century; snkbz, vol. 34) to classify shikigami characteristics. He then uses the classification of shikigami characteristics to identify two main traits: the first trait refers to magic that utilizes the innate powers of objects to carry out tasks, and the second is that of the role of a kakyü-no-kenzoku-shin (lower- ranking deities attached to Buddhist divinities; Suwa 2000, 79). Suwa gives literary examples of Seimei using a leaf to kill a toad or controlling a piece of paper to do his bidding 12. The name is given as "Kuwanten" instead of "Kanchõ" in modern Japanese translations of the tale.</page><page sequence="12">no I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 40/1(2013) as indicative of the employment of an objects inner powers to perform tasks, and defines shikigami as magic that allows onmyõji to draw on the innate powers of objects and command divine powers to do his bidding (Suwa 2000, 90). He refers to the Tai-na (annual court purification rite) ceremonial procedures described in Engishiki (a collection of Engi-e ra rules and regulations that was compiled in 927; kt 26), and the usage of specific objects such as reed arrows and bows, staffs, and shields made from peachwood, as suggestive of the preva- lent Heian beliefs in the innate powers of certain objects and the employment of such objects in ritual tasks (Suwa 2000, 80-82). Bocks explanations of the ritual instruments listed in Engishiki echoes Suwas idea by elaborating that the "bows and staffs of peachwood demonstrate the Chi- nese belief in the efficacy of the wood of the peach tree for warding off evil" (Bock 1985, 83). The construction of shikigami was influenced by the idea of ki a Daoist concept that refers to an inner life-force or essence that is believed to exist every- where and in everything from animate to inanimate objects. The inherent essence in objects can be utilized by magic spells and the process that involves the utiliza- tion of this innate energy, and its resulting effect is termed shikigami. The onmyõji is dependent on objects that possess the energy, such as a leaf or paper, and magi- cal incantations to summon the powers existing within the relevant objects, and implies that shikigami is seen as a naturally-existing energy instead of an internal magical prowess cultivated through individual spiritual practice. This animistic view of shikigami as external energy that onmyõji can utilize runs into the problem of identifying the nature of energy that it originated from. However, an exami- nation of the deeper significance behind this animistic definition suggests that shikigami is actually a means through which the onmyõji controls the innate energy in natural elements with magical incantations. The concept of shikigami as a type of magic spell to control objects imparts a magico-religious aura to Onmyõdõ. Shikigami as a Magical Curse Miura elaborates on the magico-religious aspect of shikigami by describing it as a form of human-created magical curse. This differs from Toyoshima and Suwas concept of shikigami as energies inherent in objects that are tapped by onmyõji through the use of spells. Instead, he sees shikigami as the epitome of Onmyõdõ magic spells and refers to the tales in Ökagami , Konjaku mongatari shü , Uji shüi mongatarU Genpeijõsuiki , and Kojidan (1212-1215; see snkbt, vol. 41) to draw out various facets of shikigami , such as a helper spirit who carries out mundane chores or a fearful kami with killing abilities, though he admits that none of the characteristics can be clarified or proven in present-day scholarship (Miura 2002, 32-33). Miura studies the relationship between Onmyõdõ and magic by focusing on magic spells in Onmyõdõ tradition with an emphasis on jujutsu PÄffi (magic</page><page sequence="13">PANG: THE SPIRIT SERVANT OF ONMYÕDÕ | 111 spells and incantations) and juhõ PÄii (magic rituals) that he sees as having been influenced by fuko ZEft and the Taoist magic oigoraihõ S® ft, a spell that con- trols supernatural elements such as ghosts and fox spirits (Miura 2002, 32-35). Fuko , or gu Ô in Mandarin, is a Chinese poisonous curse that is created by sealing five venomous creatures such as a centipede, toad, snake, scorpion, and gecko in a sealed jar and letting them devour each other. The sole surviving crea- ture is believed to be the most powerful as it contains the venom of the other creatures and it becomes the gu that is used to carry out spells and cause the victim to be under the control of the spell-caster. Hu explains that the magic of gu is said to employ the use of poisonous insects that have the qualities of evil ghosts and goblins to attack people, and this reinforced belief in its highly poi- sonous and shape-shifting attributes (Hu 1999, 370). Chinese folk beliefs have a great variety of gu , such as snakes, dogs, cats, lizards, toads, silkworms, and centipedes. These can fly, swim, transform shape, illuminate, appear, and disap- pear without a trace. During the early Qin period of China, it was believed that victims who suffered from an illness inflicted by a gu attack would be in a state of mental confusion as if possessed by spirits, and gu owners would use magic to command gu to fly into food or drink and bring all kinds of illnesses through the gu till the victim died, or even stealthily shift the victims wealth to the gu own- ers houses. A more sinister aspect of gu is its ability to allow its owner to control the soul of the dead victim (Hu 1999, 371-72). Miura sees similar characteristics between gu and shikigami. As indicative of gu practices, he takes the tale of an onmyõji, Dòma ÜIS from Uji shüi monoga- tari and Kojidan , who seals a curse in an earthen pot to harm Fujiwara no Michi- naga Si J® 31 ä (966-1027), and refers to Genpeijõsuiki to suggest that shikigami could also be gu in human form (Miura 2002, 33). By relating shikigami to gu magic spells, Miura presents shikigami as a form of malignant human-created curses rather than energy tapped from naturally-existing elements. Miuras study of shikigami from the perspective of gu associates magic rituals in the Onmyõdõ tradition with Chinese magic spells and suggests that the develop- ment of Onmyõdõ into a magico-religious practice was influenced by Chinese magical practices. Shikigami as a Supernatural Being The most common idea of shikigami presented by Japanese scholars is that of a supernatural being under the command of onmyõji. The dictionaries of Nihon kokugo daijiten and Kõjien define shikigami as a supernatural attendant to onmyõji , and most Japanese scholars generally identify shikigami as a spirit servant that can be commanded by onmyõji to change forms, carry out mul- tiple tasks, or perform unbelievable feats, though different terms are given to</page><page sequence="14">112 I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 40/1(2013) denote the type of supernatural being that it is. Scholars such as Tachibana and Kato (1996), Kawaguchi (1983), Miki and Asami (1990), and Matsuo and Nagai (1997) describe shikigami as kijin in their annotations of Japanese classi- cal texts. Komine Kazuaki s annotation of Konjaku mongatari shü identifies it as a kakyü shin TSWÍ (lower- ranking subordinate deity; Komine 1994, 412), while Mabuchi et al (2001, 284) call it a seirei Mb, (spirit, ghost or genie). Harima et als annotation of Zokukojidan refers to it as a reijin 31 tt (spiritual being or deity that performs striking miracles; 2002, 35). Annotations in Japanese classi- cal texts establish shikigami as a supernatural being though it is uncertain as to whether it should be viewed as a spirit (seirei), lower-ranking deity ( kakyü shin , reijin), or demon god (kijin). The difficulties in expressing the complex ideas embodied in shikigami can also be seen in Western translations of Japanese classical texts where scholars such as McCullough refer to it as "spirit" (1980, 81), Tyler opts for "genie" (2002, 85), while D. E. Mills uses "familiar" (1970, 340). Bathgate identifies it as "spirit-familiar" in his discussion of signification in Japanese religion and folklore (2004, 131). Such terms tend to reduce the religious and philosophical symbolism embodied in shikigami by imposing cultural attributes embodied in the foreign concepts of "genie" and "spirit-familiar" that can undermine the actual functions and meanings of shikigami by overlooking its particularities and distinct niche in Japanese religious thought. Some Japanese scholars have tried to compare shikigami with other supernat- ural beings to establish a better understanding of what it is. Using an example of the fourteenth century illustrated scroll painting Fudõriyaku-engi emaki , Toyoshima sees the portrayal of shikigami as two diminutive helpers assisting Seimei in a ceremonial purification rite to subdue demons of ailments as simi- lar to the attendant roles of Kongara J7 and Seitaka the gohõdõji lÍčfemŤ (attendant gods that are commanded by divine protectors of the Bud- dhist Laws) to Fudõmyõou in Esoteric Buddhism (Toyoshima 2002, 137). He then quotes from a Tendai Esoteric Buddhist text, Anchin hikuketsu kyõryõchi to illustrate that both shikigami and gohõdõji share the same essence and functions despite the difference in methodological teach- ings (Toyoshima 2002, 138). Similarly, Suwa compares the role of shikigami as a kakyü-no-kenzoku-shin (lower-ranking deity attached to Buddhist divinities) as akin to that of a gohõdõji summoned by Buddhist ascetics to perform tasks, though he specifies that shikigami do not possess the responsive element of gohõdõji in that it does not respond to the prayers of the faithful as gohõdõji do (Suwa 2000, 90). Suwa also highlights that gohõdõji are bequeathed on faithful Buddhist ascetics by Buddhist gods while shikigami are summoned by onmyõji through incantations and hand signs (Suwa 2000, 87). Suwa explains these differences</page><page sequence="15">pang: the spirit SERVANT OF ONMYÕDÕ I 113 to be the result of Chinese Daoist yigui ÍSA (servant spirits) being the proto- type for shikigami, where the qualities of possessing both invisible and physical forms, being summoned through incantations and under the command of their masters, were regarded as key influences in the development of shikigami (Suwa 2000, 91-95). Despite the difficulty in establishing the category of supernatu- ral being that shikigami belong to, it can be understood here that shikigami is commonly viewed as a spirit entity that can be summoned by human onmyõji through spells and incantations, rather than bestowed by divinities or attained after a long process of spiritual self-cultivation. One particular tale involving Seimei and Emperor Kazan TEULl (968-1008) in Okagami explicitly depicted shikigami as a supernatural being. With the political rise of Fujiwara no Michinaga as the setting, the mid-eleventh to early- twelfth cen- tury literature of Okagami recorded historical tales about the Imperial Court from the reign of Emperor Montoku (r. 850-858) to Emperor Go-Ichijõ (r. 1016-1036). The excerpt taken from the chapter, "The Sixty-Fifth Reign, Emperor Kazan"13 describes the fateful night in 969 where the emperor was on an incognito journey to become a monk at Kazanji TElLJtF. As he passed by Seimei s house along Tsuchimikado street, he overheard Seimei announcing a prediction derived from observations of astrological signs about his forthcoming abdication and later, instructing a shikigami to enter the Imperial Palace. Okagami presents several pertinent elements of the physical abilities of shikigami. In this tale, shikigami were able to accurately identify Emperor Kazan, describe his actions, and even analyze the situation after seeing the emperor s retreating figure. The physical power to move objects such as opening a door and vocal and analytical abilities to report happenings to Seimei highlight the corporeality of shikigami. However, shikigami are shown to still be restricted by the physical limitations of distance and materiality as it needed to open the door before it could observe the persons actions. These physical limitations dif- fer from earlier amorphous descriptions of shikigami in Makura no sõshi as the augury tool of shikisen , with the fluid ability to know all the happenings in the Imperial Court. Seimei s position as the epitome of Onmyõdõ skills is highlighted in this short excerpt where his astrological knowledge and magical expertise are augmented by the supernatural presence of shikigami that served to emphasize his easy mastery over supernatural beings. Seimei s specific command for "one of you shikigami" ( shikigami hitori ÂÍÍ-^À) to enter the palace indicates the presence of several shikigami at his bidding. Even though it is not revealed in this tale how many shikigami Seimei possessed, the numerical capacity to pos- sess many shikigami serves to enhance an onmyõji s capability in manipulating many elements. 13. The translation was taken from McCullough (1980, 80).</page><page sequence="16">114 I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 40/ 1 (2013) The Dangers ofShikigami From the study of contemporary research on Onmyõdõ, I have categorized the various definitions of shikigami offered by Japanese scholars into five main ideas: a metaphorical reference to shikisen and onmyõjts prognostic powers; a repre- sentation of human will and consciousness; a type of inherent energy in objects that can be utilized through spells; a human-created magical curse; and a spirit servant that can be summoned through spells and incantations. Although we now know that shikigami are controlled and manipulated by human means, there are instances where the power of shikigami can extend beyond human control to effect results that are sometimes hazardous. One such instance is seen in Zokukojidan (1219, "Anthology of military tales"; snkbt, vol. 41). A tale in the chapter, "Section on officials" ( Shinsetsu Ein) describes the fateful downfall of Minamoto no Takaakira iSîSffl (914-983), son of Emperor Daigo PB68I (r. 897- 930), who became the Minister of the Left in 968. In the tale, Takaakira had just left the Imperial Palace and was passing by the compound of Shinsen-en when he came across two tall beings.14 It was said that he encountered a very serious matter after the two beings called out his name. His ill-fated encounter is recorded in the excerpt below: As he reached the edge of the beam, [he observed] two tall beings standing concealed in the shadows; when they heard his approach, they revealed them- selves when there were no sounds. Takaakira detected the two beings intent and purposely made loud sounds with his feet. Just as he passed the beam, the beings called out his name. Immediately after that, Takaakira encountered a grave matter and he was banished from the capital.15 The historical event of Minamoto no Takaakiras demotion and exile during the Anna Incident of 969 was attributed to the unfortunate result of a run-in with shikigami. The Anna Incident was a political conspiracy orches- trated by the Fujiwara clan to eliminate military rivals in Kyoto that occurred in the early spring of the second year of Anna (969). Takaakira was implicated in the plot and exiled to Kyushu for three years before he was allowed to return to the capital, where he had already lost his political influence, and became com- mitted to a quiet life of study. The Anna Incident was historically significant for removing the political and military rivals of the Hokke i^cM (Northern House of the Fujiwara clan) and Minamoto no Mitsunaka SflS# (917-997) while setting the stage for the increasing involvement of the warrior class in the politics of the 14. Some modern versions of Zokukojidan state that there are three beings instead of two. 15. The translation is mine. For the original Japanese tale, I have referred to the version pub- lished in Kawabata and Araki 2005, 21-26 and 655.</page><page sequence="17">PANG: THE SPIRIT SERVANT OF ONMYÕDÕ | II5 Imperial Court. The use of shikigami to explain an event marks a desire to attri- bute Takaakiras misfortune to an uncontrollable external force. Takaakira did not cause his own downfall because of political ambition or through any personal act but was instead portrayed as a victim of unforeseen inex- orable circumstances. The sense of regret for the fate of a tragic historical figure who was destined for greater things if not for the unexpected shikigami curse is echoed in the latter part of the tale. In the next part of the tale, a physiognomist, Kadohira He1?, was highly impressed with Takaakiras honorable face, exclaiming that he had not seen such glorious and admirable facial features before. But when he saw Takaakiras departing figure, he saw this as a bad omen and predicted the banishment. The inclusion of this latter part of the tale takes a sympathetic view of Takaakiras life, which was meant to be glorious and exalted but was instead heav- ily marked by the unexpected shikigami encounter. The potential for Takaakira to rise further in life was prematurely ended by the shikigami curse, one that showed a belief in the power of shikigami to alter a persons destiny. Here, the shikigami has developed a grim and sinister element: it was not a specific curse that was directed at Takaakira to intentionally cause his downfall but was the residue of a spell that was left in the Shinsen-en compound and degenerated into a freewheeling curse that harms passersby. The excerpt below taken from the same tale gives the reason for the presence of shikigami at Shinsen-en: "During the time of the Horse Racing Festival [kurabeuma SSM] at Shinsen-en, the shikigami that was buried by an onmyõji has yet to be removed. This spirit is making its presence known. Even now, that area should not be entered," remarked an onmyõji named Ariyuki.16 The casual appearance of shikigami in the form of two tall beings had a very negative effect on passersby such as that which the onmyõji , Ariyuki, cautioned against entering the area that they occupied. Most tales describe shikigami as under command by an onmyõji to set curses on the victim where shikigami have no deliberate personal intention to harm people. But the two shikigami that Takaakira encountered were not under any human control and instead acted on their own without any instructions from their onmyõji master. As Ariyuki explained, the shikigami were merely making their presence known, with disas- trous consequences for the unfortunate Takaakira. The change of shikigami from an agent that was commanded to spy and set curses into an uncontrolled force that lingered around to willfully harm innocent passersby is a new develop- ment in shikigami characteristics. Instead of having their forms dictated by their onmyõji masters, shikigami can manifest on their own and even emit sounds to 16. The translation is mine. For the original Japanese tale, I have referred to the version pub- lished in Kawabata and Araki 2005, 21-26 and 655.</page><page sequence="18">li 6 I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 40/1(2013) make their presence known. The fact that shikigami know Takaakiras name indi- cates that they are aware and have clear knowledge of their surroundings and social environment. This reflects the same characteristics displayed in an earlier text, Makura no sõshi , where shikigami were believed to know everything that happened, and Okagami where it was able to identify the emperor and report his actions to Seimei. Another development in shikigami characteristics is its diversion from its original task. As explained by Ariyuki in the tale, shikigami were buried in the racing arena at Shinsen-en compound as protective charms during the Horse Racing Festival. The changing characteristics of a harmful curse that was meant to target a specific person, as in the case of the young chamberlain in Uji shüi monogatari , to bringing capricious harm on an innocent passerby as seen in Takaakiras demotion, echoed the Japanese belief of tsukumogami Inani- mate objects are believed to become demonized as tsukumogami after a long, substantial period of neglect or abandonment. They gain powers such that they are able to plague mischief on humans. The harmful powers of tsukumogami are so feared that annual rituals such as Harikuyõ i+ffiîl17 are conducted to pacify old and used objects to prevent them from becoming demonized and bring- ing harm on humans. The two shikigami at Shinsen-en were a spell that had been buried and forgotten without an onmyõji to remove or pacify them with rites. In the same manner as abandoned objects that became tsukumogami , the two shikigami became demonized such that they changed from their original task of protecting and preventing disasters during the Horse Racing Festival to a destructive element that brought harm on passersby. The protective quality of shikigami changed to a fear of the potential harm that it was capable of, such that earlier literary descriptions of shikigami as a supernatural force with all-pervasive and insidious magical powers that was still under human control were replaced by depictions of an uncontrolled spirit that could freely harm innocent people without any specific instructions from an onmyõji. With the random appearances of the two shikigami at Shinsen-en and the warning by onmyõji Ariyuki to avoid the area rather than rectify the situation by removing the shikigami , the onmyõji s stalwart manipulation over supernatural forces is put into question. Such wariness of the potential dangers of shikigami is captured in descrip- tions of its strange appearance. The Genpeijõsuiki describes the need for Seimei to conceal his shikigami under Ichijõ-modori Bridge as his wife feared their appearances. But this suggestion of the fearsome image of shikigami was likely due to the creation of images that provided a visualization of this supernatu- 17. This is an annual memorial service (kuyõe ÍÂíêzs) held on 8 February or 8 December to give thanks to old or broken needles by piercing them in tofu or konnyaku jelly, or by wrapping them in paper.</page><page sequence="19">PANG: THE SPIRIT SERVANT OF ONMYÕDÕ | 11 7 ral being.18 One such image of shikigami is the fourteenth-century illustrated picture scroll of Fudõriyaku-engi emaki , which belongs to the Tokyo National Museum and is listed as an Important Cultural Property of Japan. Fudõriyaku- engi emaki provides an excellent and detailed record of the proceedings of an Onmyõdõ ceremonial ritual and features shikigami as two diminutive helpers assisting Seimei in a purification rite to subdue demons of ailments. The two shikigami depicted in the emaki are half the size of the human characters with demon-like facial features, bulbous noses, wide gaping mouths, bushy eyebrows, and pointed ears. Their unruly, short hair is brown as opposed to the black hair of the human characters and they have claw-like feet and unnatural skin colors of red and pale green that resemble the strange appearances of the five demons of ailments seated in front of the ceremonial table. The two small-size shikigami are barefoot and clad in flowing robes that expose their arms. One of them is encased in an upper-body armor that resembles scales. The image of shikigami portrayed in Fudõriyaku-engi emaki had a strong influ- ence on many later works such as the sixteenth century Nakifudõ-engi emaki , which belongs to the Shõjõkein collection. It is a replica of the Fudõriyaku-engi emaki and features shikigami with prominent, unusual features such as bulging eyes, protruding cheekbones, long fangs, and skin colors of deep red and green. The two shikigami in the emaki are attired in short robes that expose their arms and legs, with one of them having animal skin wrapped around its waist. Portrait paintings of Seimei also frequently depict a shikigami attendant kneeling by his feet with demon-like features. One of the oldest portrait paintings of Seimei is the early Muromachi work Abe no Seimei-kõ gazò that belongs to the Abe Õji Shrine l®Tfp3rřtttt in Osaka. Although the shikigami attendant is attired in an elaborate outfit of a patterned green robe with long white pants and straw san- dals, it is depicted as small-sized with the same demon-like facial features of big bulging eyes, a protruding eyebrow ridge, a wide-gaping mouth, and green skin. The peculiar appearances of shikigami in pictorial works might have influenced literary descriptions of shikigami as demon-like and fearsome. The question that remains in my study of shikigami is why it has acquired such a bizarre and threatening appearance that seems to run counter to the courtly demeanor of Seimei, a court onmyõji from the aristocratic class. Legends of Seimei being a descendent of a fox spirit might have encouraged such fantastical portray- als of shikigami to accentuate his mythical status, but I would like to suggest that its demonic appearance could also be due to the nature of Onmyõdõ rituals. As part of his study of the religious and thaumaturgical aspects of Onmyõdõ, Yamashita 18. The idea of the influence of illustrated picture scrolls on textual constructions of shikigami was provided by Komine Kazuaki during my research presentation at one of his graduate study groups at Rikkyo University, Tokyo, 4 February 2009.</page><page sequence="20">ii8 I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 40/ 1 (2013) looked into the characteristics of its rituals and saw that the gods of worship in Onmyõdõ have close associations with nature and are usually the anthropo- morphic representations of the elements and astrological signs (Yamashita 2006, 102-3). Ranging from the god of the underworld, known as Taizan Fukun to deities of star constellations like the Big Dipper, the power of these gods was seen to achieve its full potential at night. As the characters of the gods are deeply connected with the time that the rituals are conducted, Onmyõdõ rites like the Taizan fukun sai were conducted after sunset (Yamashita 2006, 109). Onmyõji went to a requested place such as a supplicants abode when they were engaged to conduct rituals, since Onmyõdõ does not have a fixed place of worship, whether in the form of shrines or temples. There are also examples of the rituals being held at the onmyõji s own residence (Yamashita 2006, 104-8). What made these rituals unique was that they were often held at night and outdoors. Although most of the rituals deal with spirit exorcism, purification rites, and disas- ter prevention, Onmyõdõ rituals came to be associated with elements of darkness due to the characters of the gods of worship and the time and venue of conduct. With this impression of darkness, and possibly the occult, shikigami as symbolic representations of the thaumaturgical powers of the onmyõji were likely given strange, demon-like appearances to enhance the mysterious allure of Onmyõdõ. The Disparity of Shikigami Literary descriptions of shikigami in various texts present qualities that range from being an amorphous entity, to having a variety of physical forms and abilities such as being able to act as a messenger, perform mundane household chores, aid in ceremonial rituals, give predictions, set curses, spy, assassinate people, and van- quish demons. Despite common understandings of shikigami as spirit servants of onmyõji , shikigami are not as fully controllable as what most Japanese scholars have suggested. Yet the disruptive potential of the unmanageable and demon-like shikigami are often sidelined in preference of casting shikigami as obedient super- natural helpers of onmyõji. Another quality of shikigami that has been lacking in scholastic study is the specificity of its existence. Legends of Seimei s exceptional magical abilities are sometimes shown by his possession of many shikigami at his command. The use of shikigami as a gauge of the onmyõji s magical power and knowledge is highlighted by Chitoku s test for Seimei and his strong admiration of Seimei s ability to manipulate another's shikigami in the Konjaku monogatari shü tale mentioned earlier in this article (Tale 16). As indicated by Chitoku s deliberate flaunting to Seimei of his ability to control two shikigami , the ability to manipulate several shikigami acts as an indication of an onmyõji s magical prowess and skillful command over super- natural forces. The praise for Chitoku s extraordinary magical powers is extolled</page><page sequence="21">PANG: THE SPIRIT SERVANT OF ONMYÕDÕ | II9 in Tale 19 of Konjaku monogatari shü , "The Tale of Chitoku, the onmyõji from Harima,"19 where he is described as using magic to help a group of merchants retrieve their stolen goods from pirates. The ending of Tale 19 states that Chitoku was a fearful character due to his ability to effortlessly subdue a gang of vicious pirates, but he suffered defeat when he encountered Seimei because he had no knowledge of the skill to control another onmyõji s shikigami. Despite Chitokus fearsome magical powers and excellent control over his own shikigami , he is depicted as inferior to Seimei due to his inability to conceal and manipulate another onmyõji s shikigami. The fluidity of control over shikigami implies that it is not permanently bound to a particular person, whether by spells or mental control. Chitokus experi- ence reveals the belief that if one possesses the necessary knowledge of the spell, shikigami can be easily manipulated and even captured from another onmyõji. In other words, the control over shikigami can be obtained through the possession of the requisite knowledge rather than dependence on heavenly gifts or boons from divinity. This autonomy from divine grants and reliance on specialized know- ledge conversely caused restrictions to the attainment of such magical knowledge. Masuo Shin ichirõ argues that Chitoku was unaware of the spell to control another onmyõji s shikigami due to his status as an onmyõji from Harima (WÜ H), the for- mer name of the southwest area of present-day Hyogo that was regarded as an undeveloped peripheral region outside of the Kyoto capital (Masuo 2008, 208). Masuo sees Chitoku s lack of knowledge of Seimei s spell as an indication of the difference in the magical skills and characteristics between the commoner onmyõji and court onmyõji belonging to the central, state-controlled Onmyõryõ. Under the ritsuryõ laws, the hereditary aristocratic families of Abe SMír20 and Kamo Ä3c21 were accorded the responsibility of being sacerdotal lineages of Onmyõdõ. The ritsuryõ state, described by McMullen as opening the way to the "political ascendency of oligarchic noble lineages," resulted in monopolies in the various spheres of politics, religion, and culture as certain family lineages were accorded hereditary specialties (McMullen 1996, 75). As the ecclesiastic practitioners of Onmyõdõ were of aristocratic lineages, the possession of texts about Daoism, yin-yang theory, and ceremonial rites were primarily controlled by the Abe and Kamo sacerdotal lineages that in effect prevented commoner onmyõji from accessing such knowledge. This divergence between commoner 19. The translation is mine. The original title is "Harima-no-kuni onmyõji chitoku-hõshi no koto dai-jùkyû."

Furthermore, in the final part of Tale 16 the descendents of Seimei could hear sounds made by shikigami in Seimei's original abode, the Tsuchimikado house. The suggestion here is that the shikigami possessed by Seimei continued to exist after the death of their master. Yet, the shikigami did not appear to be inherited by the descendents of Seimei since they could only hear but not see or control them. Shikigami are not hereditary substances that can be passed on physically or bio- logically to another person, but specific knowledge is required to possess them. As highlighted by Chitoku s experience, knowledge of the spell is required before one can control a shikigami , suggesting that Seimeis descendents did not possess the necessary knowledge to control shikigami , a pertinent element that is representa- tive of Onmyõdõ magical powers. Despite the underlying suggestion that shikigami were not under the control of Seimei s descendents, their continued presence in the Abe household denotes their presence as guardians of the Abe clan, which in turn serves to maintain the legitimacy of the Abe sacerdotal lineage of Onmyõdõ. Shikigami and the Shikiõji of the Izanagi-ryü Narratives allow for an understanding of the various aspects of shikigami and reveal some of the underlying meanings embodied in this enigmatic entity. To get a more concrete idea of the workings of shikigami , I refer to the practices of the Izanagi-ryû a sect related to Onmyõdõ that is still in practice in con- temporary Japan in a village located in Kochi prefecture, Shikoku. Current knowl- edge of the Izanagi-ryù has gained much from the works of Komatsu (1994; 2011), Saitõ Hideki (2000; 2002), and Takagi (1996), whose research on this reclusive and slowly disappearing sect has offered important insights into the magic spells and rituals of Onmyõdõ and allowed for a better understanding of Onmyõdõ practices. Their description of the activities of the kitõshi í/í t# SP (thaumaturgists who perform rituals and prayers) of the Izanagi-ryù include prominent rituals that involve the handling of curses, noroi-chõbuku (setting of curses), suso- no-iwai-naoshi PiEläOiKÄL (removal of curses), and suso-no-kaeshi (retaliatory spells). Of particular interest for this article is the suso-no-kaeshU a ritual undertaken with the intention to send the curse back and exact revenge on the spell-caster (Komatsu 1994, 189). It is believed that if suso-no-kaeshi is used by a stronger opponent, the curse will return and double its effects on the spell-caster. In the case of the spell-caster who was killed by his own shikigami curse in "Seimei sealing the young Archivist Minor Captains curse" in Uji shüi monogatari , a messenger visited Seimei to reveal that the shikigami curse had turned back (shikigami-kaeri on the enemy onmyõji with fatal results. Since</page><page sequence="23">pang: the spirit SERVANT OF ONMYÕDÕ I 121 the curse was prevented from executing its deadly task on the chamberlain by Seimei s protective spells, it retaliated and killed its master instead. The mor- tal defeat of the enemy onmyõji by Seimei due to his inferior magic skills sug- gests a perilous process of power struggles in Onmyõdõ where the level of magic skills that an onmyõji possesses has important life and death consequences, and demonstrates a competitive need in Onmyõdõ practice to acquire a high level of magical abilities to guard against the effects of retaliatory spells. Seimei s action of laying protective spells around the chamberlain and sending the shikigami curse back to the enemy onmyõji is remarkably similar to suso-no-kaeshi. Komatsu mentions that the kitõshi are often reluctant to set curses due to the fear of the harmful power of suso-no-kaeshi and the fatal retributive effect known as kayari-no-kaze M ty that has continued negative repercussions on future generations of the kitõshts family (Komatsu 1994, 195). Many kitõshi have displayed a strong reluctance to acknowledge the use of the curse- setting ritual noroi-chõbuku , preferring instead to perform the suso-no-iwai-naoshi , a ritual to remove curses from the victim (Komatsu 1994, 188-90). Such wariness of the grave effects of suso-no-kaeshi and kayari-no-kaze on the kitõshi suggests the sym- biotic nature of curses. Another probable reason for the kitõshi s aversion to setting noroi-chõbuku is the negative association of this ritual with evil sorcery. Prefer- ring to cast themselves as healers rather than sorcerers with ulterior motives, the kitõshi try to avoid having any open connections with noroi-chõbuku. In many of the rituals of the kitõshi, the shikiõji is indispensable to the execution of their arsenal of magic spells and incantations (Komatsu 1994, 199). Seen by Komatsu and Saitõ as another name for shikigami , shikiõji is a term that was likely derived from a combination of shikigami Ätt and õji žEť, also known as dõji IIť in Shugendo (Saitõ 2002, 192). Saitõ sees the creation of shikiõji as evi- dence of the syncretism of Onmyõdõ and Shugendo. While the shikiõji performs an assortment of tasks, its duties can be broadly organized into four main functions: to act as a protective guardian of the kitõshi , to expel curses and spirits that cause diseases, to return the shikiõji sent from opponents with retaliatory effects, and to set curses and send misfortune (Komatsu 1994, 135). What should be noted is that shikiõji is a generic term for the deities summoned and controlled by the kitõshi. It is not specific, as many types of shikiõji can be conjured up from the innumerable spirits and deities that exist (Komatsu 1994, 199-200) and their functions differ according to the type of hõmon (doctrinal texts) with which they were sum- moned (Saitõ 2002, 192). Hõmon is considered different from saimón %r:~% (ritual prayers) as it is used specifically for the summoning of shikiõji. Rather than focus on the magical abilities and functions, hõmon narrates the birth and historical ori- gins of shikiõji (Saitõ 2002, 192). The kitõshi is said to possess a large inventory of hõmon to facilitate the summoning of various shikiõji according to their intended purpose. As such, the more hõmon a kitõshi knows, the more powerful his magical</page><page sequence="24">122 I Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 40/ 1 (2013) figure 1.

All photographs by author. powers are seen to be since he will be able to summon more varieties of shikiõji to do his bidding (Komatsu 1994, 135). In view of the wide array of shikiõji commanded by the kitõshi , Saitõ argues that it is too simple to classify shikigami as low- ranking spirit servants based on the fact that animal spirits such as dogs, snakes, frogs, and eagles are often used as shikigami. There are also examples of gods of the mountains, rivers, and land who can be summoned as shikigami if the appropriate type of hõmon is recited (Saitõ 2002, 302). What Saitõ attempts to do here is to show the capacity of Onmyõdõ in accessing the various supernatural realms of the world and the prominence of its rituals as more than mere occult practices dealing with shady figures. Conclusion Regardless of its ambiguous existence in the Onmyõdõ tradition, shikigami is accepted as a fictional truth by religious institutions such as Seimei Shrine Bf ^ in Kyoto and Abe no Seimei Shrine icfë W in Osaka. Seimei Shrine states on its website that "shikigami are kijin or shieki-jin [íííxtt; servant gods]</page><page sequence="25">PANG: THE SPIRIT SERVANT OF ONMYÕDÕ I 123 figure 2. Small-scale model of Ichijõ-modori Bridge. used in Onmyõdõ that are invisible to normal humans. Abe no Seimei was adept at controlling shikigami and used them for various tasks that ranged from household chores to ceremonial rites. He was said to have normally sealed his shikigami under Ichijõ-modori Bridge as his wife feared their existence."22 The importance placed on establishing the authenticity of Seimei s legends is clearly shown in the shrines special display of a big stone-carved monument with a shikigami statue (figure 1) kneeling beside a small-scale reproduction of Ichijõ- modori Bridge (figure 2) that was constructed within the shrine compounds, and the sale of hand-phone straps that are decorated with a small shikigami rep- lica (figure 3, following page). Abe no Seimei Shrine, which also venerates Seimei and has promoted itself to be the sacred site of his birthplace, explains in its published book of Seimei legends that shikigami are "kijin that follow the commands of onmyõji" and describes their appearance as small-sized and demon-like (Shimura 2005, 26). The Seimei Shrine and Abe no Seimei Shrines emphasis on the magical exploits of Seimei and his mastery over shikigami is understandably meant to enhance the power and charismatic appeal of their figure of veneration, though the utili- zation of shikigami as a publicity tool unavoidably results in an endorsement and 22.

The adoption of shikigami narratives by Seimei Shrine and Abe no Seimei Shrine to legitimize the legendary exploits of past figures highlights the effect of shikigami narratives on the way that the religious institutions of Onmyõdõ construct their religious identity and practices, and illustrates mutual influences between reli- gion and literature. My search for the significance of shikigami has aimed at delineating its char- acteristics and is intended to question the ways we engage the use of literary texts in analyzing a religious symbol. As I studied the ways scholarly discourse navi- gates the manifold literary portrayals of shikigami and produces differing defini- tions of this being, I was made aware of how our understandings of Japanese religions are often subjected to the limitations of available texts. Yet, this does not restrict the potential of literature in providing alternative perspectives to Japanese religions. As I have tried to show in this article through a presentation of the various definitions and aspects of shikigami , from its dangerous potential to its discriminatory tendencies, the study of shikigami is not about classifying it as a spirit or a god, or pigeonholing it as a type of evil or good sorcery, but is to speak of the ambivalent nature of Japanese religions.
