<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONCEPTS AND PROBLEMS OF PRIMATE SOCIOMETRY C. R. CARPENTER, CAPTAIN, AIR CORPS The Pennsylvania State College Detailed descriptions of primate groupings have been published and these can be consulted by those who are interested. A selected bibliography is given with this article. Although only a few of the hundreds of known species of sub-human primates have been intensively studied, enough in- formation is available to show what the problems are and to illustrate concepts and methods which can be used to solve them. This paper deals primarily with theory and methodology. The emphasis is on those phases of procedures for studying free-ranging monkeys and apes which relate to the sociometric techniques and concepts. Requirements for Field Studies Sample populations and feasible environments are selected for the species to be observed before a study of wild primates can be successfully completed. Ideally, animal subjects and environments are selected which have not been molested or modified by man. The animals are most validly studied in that environment which has operated selectively on the evolution of the species and to which the subjects are fittingly adapted. Primate types and field locations are chosen, furthermore, which favor the application of observational and photographic recording procedures. Prolonged and intensive observations are required in order to yield adequate and reliable results. Methods of work are developed or applied which least disturb the normal behavior of subjects. All of these selection requirements are made necessary by either practical or theoretical considerations. Generally it is desirable in studies of free-ranging primates to collect data which, when organized, will permit comparisons of the groupings and social behavior of a number of selected species or genera. However, due to special reactions of some types, or features of the environments where they are studied, data are sometimes collected which cannot be used for purposes of comparison. Whenever comparisons are to be made, common behavioral and social characteristics are defined and similar methods used for studying those characteristics of different genera and species (4). Monkeys and apes cannot be abstracted from their natural environ- ments for on these their natural behavior depends. Therefore, when the question of how a kind of primate behaves is answered, it is necessary to describe, in addition, those situations in which the behavior occurred. Since, however, different species are selectively adapted to different environments, 56</page><page sequence="2">PROBLEMS OF PRIMATE SOCIOMETRY 57 it is impossible to hold a large group of factors constant for comparative purposes. For example, there 'is some evidence to show that the grouping patterns of rhesus monkeys varies for those living mainly on the ground and those in heavily forested areas (3). The sizes of groups differ also between areas where food is scarce and widely dispersed and areas where food is abundant and concentrated. Characteristics of Primate Groups and Problems of Studying Them Available information shows that genera of sub-human primates have characteristic patterns of groupings and social reactions (5). For every type selected for study, therefore, adequate data are collected for describing these characteristics and their variability. For example, when it is required to know the size of groupings or the socionomic sex ratios (the relative number of males to females living in groups) of a particular kind of primate, enough groups must be enumerated to represent the range as well as the average size and socionomic sex ratios. The observer of free-ranging primates in their natural habit is impressed by the complexity of their groupings and social interactions. These com- plexities cannot be accurately represented by statistical data only on the number of animals of different ages and sexes living 'in groups. Each indi- vidual may theoretically interact with every other one in the group. Each animal moreover, has its own variable social or group status. Furthermore, the organized group has internal boundaries or cleavages which must be considered. Because of these sub-groupings, some individuals are restricted in their movements and social interactions while others, which are more dominant or have more extensive social tolerance or prestige, are accepted throughout the group. At least two approaches are possible in describing primate groups. An attempt can be made to describe the group as a whole or each possible elemental relation can be described and these descriptions re-composed to represent the entire group. Actually the field observer does both. In order to represent whole groups which are organized and function cohesively, statistical enumerations must be supplemented by scatter plots or maps which represent patterns or forms of groups. Although this method of representation has not been used intensively, it holds promising possi- bilities. The technique is seemingly practical when applied to types of animals in situations which are favorable to this kind of research. In order to map the pattern or form of a group, the first requirement</page><page sequence="3">58 SOCIOMETRY is that each animal be identified. Secondly, the interactions must be recorded of each individual with every other socially accessible animal of the group. This can be done on a sampling basis provided the sampling in terms of number of interactions and time is adequate for reliability. Thirdly, in order to evaluate strength or intensity of interactions, data must be col- lected on spacing and the duration of associations. And finally the quality and amount of behavior exhibited during interactions must be specified. The application of these procedures to the study of groupings results in data which can be so presented as to represent the many features of a group structure as a whole. Dominant individuals can be represented as can sub-groupings of both relatively temporary and fairly permanent types. The main key to group mapping of this kind is to record the average spacial arrangements and the mean or average duration of these spacings. The strength or intensity of a relationship is inversely proportional to average spacing and directly proportional to duration of association. This viewpoint seems to have much in common with basic sociometric concepts. A full explanation of behavioral interactions requires not only that time-space relations be measured but also that the quality and strength of the interactions be described. For example, assume that the interactions of two males are under study. The animals are continuously together, i.e., the spacing is close and long continued. Actual interactions are enumerated. If no further data are collected, basic facts for describing the relationship are not very meaningful. However, if in addition, the quality of behavioral interactions is described, the relationship takes on much more significance. If the reactions are homosexual, playful or pugnacious, then different mean- ings are implied. . The causes for the relationship are understandable and future interactions are indicated. When attention is directed toward a single relationship between two individuals, the interactions are found also to be complex and for some purposes require detailed analysis. Generally the interactions have two qualities; either they are in some degree antagonistic or affinitive. However, these qualities may be said to be organismically summated, i.e., both positive and negative factors are involved but the elements with similar sign which predominate in strength determine the observable quality of the relationship. For example, during the early stages of estrus (sexual receptivity), of a female rhesus monkey, a male which she approaches reacts typically to her approaches by attacking and biting her. She may be seriously wounded but nevertheless the approach reactions are continued and a close and persisting association is eventually formed (3). The sexual motivation (with positive</page><page sequence="4">PROBLEMS OF PRIMATE SOCIOMETRY 59 sign) of the female exceeds in strength the results of antagonistic responses (with negative sign) of the male. Therefore, the summated interactions give an affinitive quality to the relationship. When the behavior of the male is observed it is noted that initial antagonistic responses are superseded by affinitive responses following persistent sexual stimulation. He no longer drives the female from his envelop of individual space as he would do at other times but accepts her in the closest kind of association until he is either sexually exhausted or is replaced by a more dominant male. It would seem as if in any unilateral interactions between two primates a number of positive and negative, drive-incentive interactions, elements are involved and, to repeat, those motivational elements which are greatest in sum or product characterize the complex relationship. In an affinitive relation elements of negative sign weaken it but do not change its overall affinitive quality. Likewise elements of positive sign may modify but not entirely change an antagonistic relationship. In this kind of analytical study, gross observations of space-time asso- ciations and the counting of interactions may fail to yield definitive results unless behavior quality is considered. When a pair of primates are closely associated during the female's estrus, for example, and sexual motivation in both individuals is strong, negative elements are eclipsed by the strong sex drives. When, however, the sex drives are reduced in strength after repeated copulations, the antagonistic elements are expressed in behavior and can be observed. These successive changes should be described and, if possible, measured. Analysis of the Concept of a "Social Relation" Considerations of primate social behavior lead to questions of what, in operational terms, is meant by a "social relation" in the study of primate groupings. The concept of a relation has often been used as if referring to a real, objective phenomenon. The concept has often been reified. Actually nothing of a relationship exists outside of, or external to, the participating organisms. It is suggested that what should be meant by a "social relation" is the reciprocal interaction of the behavior of two or more individuals which stimulate and respond to each other. The behavior, in turn, should be considered as expressions of individual motivation or physiological processes. The quality of the behavior of the participating individuals is the basis for the observer's inference that similar reactions may have occurred and will occur again. To describe a single "relation" over simplifies the extremely difficult task of describing simultaneously</page><page sequence="5">60 SOCIOMETRY occurring, complex behavioral interactions and their successive changes. The complexity of 'interactions is great indeed when groups contain large num- bers of individuals. In this connection, there is danger of anthropomorphic thinking when dealing with animal "societies". Proof is lacking that even the highly developed sub-human primates have anything which is even analogous to human kinship relations, relations of obligation based on customs or prece- dent, and relations of agreement or contract. Social Controls of Primates Primate groupings are so organized and structured that social control rests with each individual group. This intra-group control is based on some degree of dominance, usually of the males but in some cases of females. Groups of some species are largely controlled by a single dominant male. Although organized groups, especially of the same species, compete with each other for territory, access to favorable habitats and feeding areas, the troops, bands or families of monkeys or apes do not have remote, extra-group social controls. Studies of primates have not yet shown them to have any- thing which corresponds to the extended controls exercised over members of some human families by selected and remote individuals or groups. Primate groups are controlled by the interactions among adults, usually males, of the immediate group and by direct competition between groups. This fact is favorable for the application of sociometric concepts and procedures to the study of sub-human primate social interactions. It well may be that it would prove profitable to check the validity of new socio- metric procedures by applying them to primate groupings before they are used very extensively on human subjects. Since the 'interactions of primates are more direct, contemporary and overt than those of man, and since the reactions are less camouflaged and less inhibited or distorted by learned social customs, the basic modalities of motivation are comparatively more clearly observable in primates. Effects of Conditioning and Learning The social interactions of sub-human primates are subject to modifica- tion by conditioning and learning. Continuous observations, for adequate periods of time, show that the intra-group associations change. The changes are usually gradual but may take place in a short period of time. Young males which have matured sexually but which do not have the strength to maintain a low-order dominance rank and be accepted in the group may</page><page sequence="6">PROBLEMS OF PRIMATE SOCIOMETRY 61 be driven out by repeated attacks by dominant males and females. The young males become "negatively conditioned" to the group as a whole and avoid it. Two mature males, to cite another example, with low dominance ranks may learn that the social status of each reinforces that of the other. If they stay together and coordinate their behavior, both are able to main- tain social statuses in the group against the resistance of other animals. Social statuses are summated. When successive sociometric charts are made of the space-time associations and their changes, the results of social condi- tioning, of learning and of social summation can be reliably and validly represented. Summary The requirements have been stated for studies of free-ranging primates. Some of the characteristics of primate groupings and the problem con- nected with their study have been described. A question has been raised about the meaning of the term "social relation". It was pointed out that primate social control 'is effected by behavioral interactions in the immediate group and by direct competition between groups. Sociometric techniques are suggested as one means of measuring changes which result from social conditioning and learning. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Carpenter, C. R.
