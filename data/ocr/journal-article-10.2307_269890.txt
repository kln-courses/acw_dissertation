<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GENERATION OF MONSTERS IN HESIOD JENNY STRAUSS CLAY A T THE MUSES' command, Hesiod is to sing the y7vo0 atiEv 60VTWV. He proceeds to recount the genesis not only of the gods of myth and cult, but also of natural phenomena and even of abstract forces like Strife and Deception, which, to our minds, belong to com- pletely different ontological categories. Equally anomalous is Hesiod's inclusion of a catalogue of monstrous beings (Th. 270-336). His list of fantastic beasts is by no means exhaustive (the Centaurs, for instance, do not occur), but in a typical example of Hesiodic synthesis, creatures of di- verse origins, drawn from diverse traditions, are united into a family. One could argue that these creatures were too well known from Greek art and legend to be omitted, so that Hesiod felt obliged to accommodate them somewhere in his poem.1 Yet such a presumed obligation to include some mention of the monsters accounts neither for their treatment nor for their place within the genealogical scheme of the Theogony as a whole.2 The Theogony constitutes an attempt to understand the cosmos as the product of a genealogical evolution and a process of individuation which ultimately achieves its telos under the tutelage of Zeus. As Vernant puts it, this process of individuation is simultaneously teleological, leading to a stable cosmos, whose parts and constituent elements gradually separate, delimit, and order themselves and where the divine Powers, at first absorbed in vague cosmic forces, take on their defined and definitive forms in the third generation as celestial gods, living in the con- stant light of the ether, with their particular personalities and forms, their functions ar- ticulated in relation to each other, their powers balanced and adjusted under the unshakable authority of Zeus.... At the end of this progress which has led to the 1. Cf. G. F.

See also Schoemann's Die Hesiodische Theogonie (Berlin, 1868), p. 152. It is worth noting that the proliferation of monsters in the art of the Ori- entalizing period may be contemporaneous with Hesiod. 2. M. L. West's statement (Hesiod: "Theogony" [Oxford, 1966], p. 244) that the monsters "are put among the descendants of Pontos not because they have any connexion with the sea, but because they could not be put among the descendants of Uranos" simply begs the question.

Generally speaking, Greek monsters are hybrid creatures that unite nor- mally disparate elements, for example, the human and the bestial, or com- bine distinct species.5 Frequently, too, they involve a multiplication of human or animal features or, conversely, a subtraction and isolation of features that usually occur in pairs. The monstrous creatures found out- side the monster catalogue proper, the Hundred-handers, Typho, and the Cyclopes display these characteristics. The monsters all diverge from an implied canonical form that is simultaneously theo- and anthropomorphic. Thus the Cyclopes (142-43) are described as: oi 6' fiTOt T-&amp; 1tV &amp;kka Ocoic CVakiyKtOt Tpav, itoivo 6' 6pOakOt6q P?000) ?VCKC1TO 1tETW7).

Occasionally also, as we shall see, the monsters incor- porate contradictory elements that violate fundamental categories, for in- stance, mortal/immortal, young/old, and male/female. Thus examining Hesiod's monsters can shed useful light on the underlying categories that inform the Theogony. For the most part, scholars have neglected these issues. If they discuss the passage at all, they tend to focus narrowly on the admittedly difficult problem of the referents of the pronouns in lines 295, 319, and 326.7 Yet I would argue that the catalogue as a whole represents an important phase 3.

Hamilton, The Architecture</page><page sequence="3">THE GENERATION OF MONSTERS IN HESIOD 107 in the evolution of the cosmos and that it can teach us a great deal about the articulation of Hesiod's cosmogonic thought. But first we must situate the catalogue of monsters within the overall architecture of the Theogony. After the primordial principles (Gaia, Uranus, etc.), the cosmos takes on its recognizable configuration in the generation of the Titans; but only in the following generation, that of the Olympians, does it acquire its final or- ganization under the rule of Zeus. This genealogical evolution can be seen as a process of successive separation, differentiation, and hierarchization. At the same time, however, this process is radically teleological. As a re- sult, Hesiod frequently collapses chronology, most blatantly perhaps in the Prometheus story where Zeus plays a central role, although his birth has not yet taken place. Elsewhere, too, allusions to the final and permanent or- dering of the cosmos under Zeus anachronistically intrude on descriptions of earlier phases of cosmic evolution, thus giving the Theogony as a whole a double perspective in which being and becoming are intertwined.8 Such a double vision likewise informs the catalogue of monsters. While their births occur at a relatively early phase of cosmic evolution (and hence toward the beginning of the poem), Hesiod also relates how six of them are dispatched by heroes, who belong to a much later stage of cosmic history, postdating Zeus' accession to power. Those monsters that survive are all given both a place and a function in Zeus' dispensation. This pat- tern again parallels the treatment of the monsters outside the catalogue proper, the Cyclopes, the Hundred-handers, and Typho. All are children of Gaia; nF_Xe6pta like their mother, their excessive power inspires fear, espe- cially in those who rule. Zeus' thunderbolt neutralizes the would-be usurper Typho, but the king of the gods manages to harness the monstrous might of the other two and incorporates them into his new order; the Cyclopes produce the weapons that allow Zeus to win and maintain power, while the Hundred-handers keep guard over the defeated Titans. The varied creatures that make up the monster catalogue belong to the family of Pontus, who himself is a primordial offspring of Gaia by parthe- nogenesis, much like Uranus. But unlike the latter who remains so to speak Gaia's consort, Pontus is explicitly produced aiTp -ptO6TrTos Uptg6pou (132). The birth of the salt sea is immediately followed by the birth of Oceanus, the fresh water, through the sexual union of Gaia and Uranus (133).9 Paradoxically, however, it is the barren sea that "nurtures" of Hesiodic Poetry (Baltimore, 1989), pp. 89-92. Both Hamilton, pp. 29-32, and A. Bonnaf6, Poe'sie, nature et sacre: Homere, HIesiode et le sentiment grec de la nature (Lyon, 1984), pp. 205-7, attempt to situate the catalogue of monsters more broadly within the framework of the Theogony as a whole. Bon- nafe emphasizes the chthonic character, inherited from their ancestral mother Gaia, of the whole family, while Hamilton underlines the importance of the heroes and mankind in the passage. Despite valuable observations, Hamilton's overall view of the Theogony's architecture and the place of the monster cata- logue within it raises more questions than it solves. For instance, he acknowledges (p. 24) that his insis- tence that the catalogue belongs to his category of narrative digressions is problematic, yet his schema demands such a classification. 8. Cf. Philippson, Genealogie, pp. 18-20. 9. The desire to contrast salt and fresh water may explain why Hesiod lists Oceanus first among the children of Gaia and Uranus.</page><page sequence="4">108 JENNY STRAUSS CLAY Aphrodite (191-92). Likewise, in what appears to be a unique instance of male parthenogenesis,10 Pontus generates Nereus, whose gentleness and justice counterbalance the violent and grim brood of Eris, a single male offering a positive counterweight to a host of largely female negative forces. In turn, this son of the salt sea will, in union with a daughter of Oceanus, the fresh water, generate the Nereids who embody the benign nature of their father (240-63). l Both barren and fertile, Pontus and his family embrace unexpected combinations of opposing qualities, traits that will reemerge in his monstrous progeny. Now in an incestuous drama that belongs to the earliest phases of cosmogony, Pontus mates with his mother Gaia, the Earth herself, with all her luxuriant, if sometimes irre- sponsible, fecundity. Of their four offspring, two, Thaumas and Eurybie, form forward-looking exogamous marriages.12 The two remaining chil- dren, Phorkys and Keto, join in an incestuous union, thus concentrating the elemental characteristics of their parents, to produce the monsters. Among the descendants of Phorkys and Keto, the female, the chthonic, and the bestial predominate. In the first generation, only their last-born is male. 13 Moreover, the family is characterized by a promiscuous conflation of the distinguishing features of the divine, the bestial, and the human. The Graiai, like their mother Keto KaktXnriplot (270; cf. 238), are never- theless ?K 7yVETrp noXkit, grey like their father, the Sea, whence the name that gods and men assign to them. Curiously, Hesiod ignores their most notorious characteristic, their sharing of an eye and a tooth, but empha- sizes rather their paradoxical combination of youth and age.14 Living at the end of the world, in the nocturnal far west, the Gorgons encompass yet another fundamental dichotomy; for while two of the sisters are immortal, Medusa is singled out as mortal.15 Her union with the Olympian Poseidon in a soft meadow amid spring flowers calls to mind the beginning of countless legendary genealogies, much like those contained in the Cata- logue of Women. But here the conventional idyllic scene masks the incon- gruous and the grotesque. In fact, the monstrous maid will herself be dispatched by one of those heroic offspring of divine/human unions. It is 10. Most commentators assume that Pontus mates with Gaia to produce Nereus, but Bonnaf6, Poe'sie, p. 196, recognizes his parthenogenic birth. Cf. K.

As Perseus decapitates her, Chrysaor and Pegasus are produced from Medusa's severed neck. This mode of birth, violent and unnatural, resem- bles both Cronus' castration of Uranus and Zeus' birthing of Athena, yet significantly deviates from both. If Uranus' unmanning allowed the cos- mos to come into being and the birth of Athena from Zeus' head guarantees its final ordering and permanent stability, Medusa's bizarre delivery has no such cosmic consequences. It is merely an unnatural sideshow. Then too, she herself dies at the moment of giving birth. Pegasus takes after his im- mortal equine father and is ultimately integrated into Zeus' realm, bringing the thunderbolts, emblems of his invincible power, to the king of the Olympians. Evidently mortal like his mother, Chrysaor's birth conforms more closely to that of a divinity in his "leaping forth," ?4?Oopc (281). 16 In turn, Chrysaor forms an exogamous union with the Oceanid, Kallirhoe, to produce the triple-headed Geryon who is slain by Zeus' son, Heracles. While Geryon is a well-established figure in Greek myth, Chrysaor re- mains a shadowy presence. Yet Hesiod mentions him again at the end of the Theogony (979) in the catalogue of goddesses who united with mor- tals.17 In fact, he appears largely to be a linking figure, Medusa's child and Geryon's father, yet he himself does not seem particularly monstrous. His one distinctive feature, according to Hesiod's etymologizing of his name, is his golden sword with which, apparently, he is born.18 This armed birth again reminds us of Athena, but perhaps it is likewise evoca- tive of the Giants who were engendered, along with the Erinyes and the Melian nymphs, from the bloody drops of Uranus' castrated member (183-87). I have argued elsewhere that these Giants in union with the Meliai are the ancestors of the human race.19 If this is so, one could sug- gest that Chrysaor, mighty and armed like the Giants, and who also unites with a nymph, the Oceanid Kallirhoe, represents an alternative progenitor to an alternative race of mortals. That race, however, is short-lived. At Theogony 981 Geryon is described as 3pOTcoV KLpTtYTOV (XELVTWOV. In this context, one may recall the newly-found fragments of Stesichorus' Gery- oneis where before facing Heracles in combat, Geryon muses at length over the question of his mortality:20 does he take after his goddess mother or his mortal father? His encounter with Heracles will reveal his destiny. Geryon's dilemma is that of every offspring of a divine/human union. Of course, we know he will die at the hands of Heracles, another product of such a union, but one sanctioned by Zeus himself. What I am suggesting is that the hybrid Geryon along with his hybrid ancestry parallels the 16. Cf. Hymn Hom. Ap. 119 ?K 6' 90opE irp6 0p6w 6&amp; [Apollo]; and Hymn Hom.

But while Geryon and his kin are doomed to de- struction, the similarly mixed race of heroes not only thrives, but be- comes the instrument of the annihilation of the monstrous brood. Next in the catalogue comes Echidna who, while emphatically divine (Ociriv, 297; dOVaTO . ... Kai aiyipaoS q'gaTa IaTVTQ, 305), resembles "nei- ther mortal men nor the immortal gods" (295-96). Half lovely maiden and half huge snake, she unites the anthropomorphic and the bestial. Moreover, although apparently female, she nevertheless incorporates both male and fe- male elements.21 Like her mother Keto, Echidna is KakktcRap?]O; (298, cf. 238), but she also takes after her grandmother nf?X(pr Gaia (cf. irpXwpov, 299). That the crucial events in Echidna's biography all occur in subterra- nean settings may be due to Hesiod's etymologizing of her mother Keto's name from "hollow" or "cavern."22 Born in a cave, she mates under the earth with Typho, and finally, by divine dispensation, she is assigned a cav- ernous abode "far from gods and men."23 Her reported24 union with Typho occurs ?v (ptXOT1Tt, and in fact he seems an altogether suitable consort, sprung as he is from the mating of Tartarus and ifXprp Gaia, likewise ?V pPO6Tr1Tt (822).25 For his hundred snake heads appropriately complement Echidna's snakey half, while his multiple voices unite the divine and the bes- tial (825-35). Not surprisingly, their children embody features of both par- ents and share their epithets: KpaXTpo(ppov Echidna produces KpcXTcpo(ppova T?KVa (Th. 297; cf. 308); Cerberus is dgi Xavos and (]gqT1a like his mother (Th. 3 10-1 1; cf. 295, 300); Hydra kuXyp' ci6ulav takes after kuypi Echidna (Th. 313; cf. 304). But the doggish traits of Orthos and Cerberus as well as the polycephaly of the latter and his sister Hydra seem to be inherited from their father.26 Cerberus will later receive a place and function in the orga- nization of Tartarus, ensuring that the dead cannot escape from the under- world (769-73) and thus enforcing the clear distinction between gods and mortals. The other two siblings are dispatched by Heracles, Orthos, along with his master (293), and the Lernean Hydra. The Hydra introduces something new into the catalogue. Hitherto, the monsters had been confined either under the earth or located at its extreme boundaries.27 To destroy Medusa and Geryon (and his dog), the heroes Per- seus and Heracles were required to journey thither. But with the Hydra, the 21. The gender of 6(pt is, of course, masculine, but Hesiod could have used the feminine 6pdKatva. Cf. Hymn Hom. Ap. 300. 22.

Th. 304-5 have wrongly been athetized or condemned as variants. Cf. West, "Theogony," ad loc. West's proposal, to take oi in line 301 to refer to Keto, does not solve the problem.

Iolaos, Heracles' nephew and sidekick, may perhaps be considered a repre- sentative of the human race here.28 The collocation of Ato6 uoi6 and Am- phitryoniades to describe the Hydra's destroyer Heracles renders explicit the paradoxical nature of the heroes, themselves mixed creatures, in some sense as anomalous as the beasts they slay. Moreover, the creature from the Lernean lagoon unleashes a larger divine drama embracing Hera, Zeus, his daughter Athena, as well as his son Heracles. Hesiod alludes to a conflict within the Olympian order and a challenge to Zeus' domination posed by his wife Hera, who nurtures monsters to counter Zeus' heroic line. Toward the end of the Theogony, where these incidents belong chronologically, they are more or less suppressed. Once Typho is dispatched, Zeus appears to have no further serious opponents. Intrafamilial Olympian tensions are, as it were, deflected onto conflicts between the heroes and the monsters.29 The next creature to be described in the catalogue is the Chimaera.30 (I will defer until later the notoriously difficult problem of the identity of her mother.) This fantastical fire-breathing monster not only has three heads, but those heads derive from three different species, lion, she-goat, and snake; yet the middle female element seems to dominate and gives the creature her name, a name that is nothing but the common noun to designate a year-old she-goat. There is an almost comic incongruity in the combination of a fierce lion and huge serpent with a young female goat, hardly a terrifying beast and more appropriate as a sacrificial victim.31 It is, then, perhaps no accident that the appellation comes to designate "an unreal creature of the imagination, a mere wild fancy; an unfounded conception."32 Here, in a grand confronta- tion of Mischwesen, the offspring of Medusa and Poseidon, Pegasus, the only "good" monster, teams up with the hero Bellerophon, whose father is like- wise reputed to be Poseidon, to annihilate the Chimaera. Now a she-monster, whose identity is likewise subject to dispute, unites endogamously with the dreadful hound Orthos to produce the Phix, a.k.a. the Sphinx, and the Nemean lion. As the Sphinx is generally imag- ined as a combination of woman and lion, these offspring share leonine 28. He is, of course, the son of Iphicles, Heracles' mortal brother by Amphitryo and is the first fully human being named in the Theogony. 29. For the parallels between Zeus/Typho and Heracles/Hydra, see Hamilton, Architecture, pp. 29-30 and his conclusion, p. 32: "The close connection between Keto's monstrous brood and Typhoeus suggests the diminution of both the gods' enemies and of Zeus' role in the conflict. Zeus's power is still absolute but he works through agents, his children Athena and Heracles, and the results are much more satisfactory for mankind." Cf. Bonnaf6, Poesie, p. 209. 30. W. Marg, Hesiod: Samtliche Gedichte (Darmstadt, 1984), p. 165, cites Wilamowitz' judgment ("Hesiods schlechtester Hexameter") but suggests that the verse is intentionally as monstrous as the crea- ture it describes. Cf. I. Solomon, "In Defense of Hesiod's 'schlectestem Hexameter,"' Hermes 113 (1985): 21-30. Lines 323-24 are usually thought to be interpolated from the Iliad. Cf. West, "Theogony," p. 256. Marg, Hesiod, p. 166, believes the lines are conscious citations of the Iliad. They may, however, simply be traditional. 31. Cf., for example, Aesch. Ag. 232, where Iphigeneia is likened to a sacrificial she-goat; Xen. Hell. 4.2.20, An. 3.2.12, and Plut. Lyc. 22.2.7. West, "Theogony," p. 255, calls the Chimaera "the oddest and least satisfying of the mythical monsters." Marg, Hesiod, p. 166, comments: "Es ist etwas gespielt mit dem Verhaltnis des Ziege genannten Untiers ingesamt und des Ziegenteils." 32.

About the Sphinx and her destiny we learn little, but Hesiod gives a fuller account of the beast of Nemea. Explicitly identified here as the wife of Zeus, Hera nursed the lion (as she did the Hydra) and KaTCVaWyG, "settled, established," him on the slopes of Nemea. Elsewhere in Hesiod, only Zeus and Cronos are sub- jects of KaTaVcatcL,33 and the verb appears to designate the ruler of the gods in his capacity as organizer of the cosmos. Here, on the other hand, Hera usurps and perverts her husband's role by establishing the lion at Nemea to be a bane for mankind (330-31): ?VO' &amp;p' 6 y' OiKFiO)V ?kUpaipETo (piWh dvOpb)wv, Kotpav?wv Tpiyolo N?wtrj5 ii6' Ainaavroq. In an inversion of the natural hierarchy of men and beasts, the lion rules over his surroundings34 and ?Xc(paipcTo the tribes of men who inhabit them. According to LSJ, this rare verb of unknown etymology means "to destroy" in this passage, whereas it means "to deceive" in its two Hom- eric occurrences.35 These differing definitions clearly arise from the fact that, while gods and dreams may deceive men, animals normally do not. But this may be precisely the point of Hesiod's usage or, rather, misusage, and it may give us a clue to the word's meaning. For if the Nemean lion's behavior presents an inversion of the proper relations between men and beasts through his "ruling over" men, so too may the ascription of ?X?- (paip?FTO to him. I suggest that UXc(paipogat means "to trap" and that it may be drawn from the terminology of the hunt. Such an interpretation would be appropriate to all three occurrences of the term and simultaneously emphasize the monstrousness of the lion who, under Hera's tutelage, both coopts and inverts a properly human activity. In overcoming the lion, whose pelt becomes his iconographic emblem, Heracles restores the ap- propriate hierarchical order whereby men rule over beasts. While Medusa and the Chimaera perish at the hands of the heroes Perseus and Bellerophon, Heracles remains the monster-slayer par excel- lence. In fact, each sequence of monstrous births culminates in an exploit of Heracles: Theogony 270-94 (Geryon and Orthos), 295-318 (the Hydra), and 319-32 (the Nemean lion).36 Six of the monsters, then, perish at the 33.

Why is one breed of Mischwesen honored and exalted while the other is either consigned to the depths or ends of the earth or else annihilated by the heroes? The heroes of course arrive on the cosmic scene much later than the monsters. But more than mere chronology seems to be operative here. Or, rather, chronology cannot simply be regarded as tem- poral in the Theogony. Both monsters and heroes belong to the past, but to different phases of the past. The unions of gods and mortals that give rise to the race of heroes occur during the reign of Zeus and are sanctioned by him. The existence of the heroes thus presupposes a clear distinction and separation of gods and men as opposed to the promiscuous unions of Keto's brood. This means, in turn, that the heroes can only arise after the duel of wits between Zeus and Prometheus, a confrontation whose consequence is precisely that separation ("At Mecone . . . "). The monsters, on the other hand, arise at an earlier phase of cosmic evolution, before those boundaries demarcating gods, men, and beasts are clearly defined and enforced. At this point, we can no longer put off confronting, if not heroically, at least bravely, the thorny question of the referents of the pronouns at Theogony 319 and 326.3 Who is the mother of the Chimaera? Does she have a father? And, finally, who mates with Orthos to produce the Sphinx and the lion of Nemea? The literature both ancient and modern offers almost every possible solution to these questions, and consensus remains as chimerical as the creature herself.38 Various critics have nominated Keto, Echidna, and the Hydra for the position of Chimaera's mother (319), while in line 326 the Chimaera herself is added to the list of pos- sible candidates to be the mother of the Phix and the lion of Nemea.39 Paradoxically, what is striking about all the proposed solutions is their reasonableness: in each case they depend on reasonable assumptions and normative rules. For instance, it is argued that Echidna cannot be the mother of the Sphinx and the Nemean lion because mother-son incest no 37. There is a similar difficulty at 295 where fj designates the mother of Echidna. Here, however, the modem scholarly consensus (West, "Theogony," p. 249; Abramowicz, "Quaestiunculae," p. 171; Lemke, "Beobachtungen," pp. 48-49; Siegmann, "Xilpatpa," p. 756; Wilamowitz, "Herakles," 3:259; Hamilton, Architecture, p. 89) assigns the role to Keto, with the exception of Schwabl, "Aufbau," pp. 174-76, who insists that the reference must be to Kallirhoe. Cf. F. G. Welcker, Die Hesiodische "Theogonie" (Elber- feld, 1865), p. 125. 38. The lack of genealogical clarity within this brief passage has no parallel in the Theogony, although F. Jacoby, Hesiodi "Theogonia" (Berlin, 1930), p. 9, suggested a similar ambiguity at Th. 411 concerning the mother of Hecate, but the parallel is unconvincing. Inevitably, some scholars have taken refuge in the explanation of interpolations or successive expansions of an original Hesiodic catalogue. Cf. Jacoby, pp. 8-19; and A. Meyer, De Compositione Theogoniae hesiodeae (Berlin, 1887), pp. 16-20. Yet it is difficult to understand why an interpolator would fail to integrate his additions into the existing genealogies and thereby introduce not one but two significant obscurities within seven lines. Amputating the text merely sidesteps the problem. 39. At Th. 319, the mother of the Chimaera is identified as Echidna by Wilamowitz, "Herakles," 3:260; Marg, Hesiod, p. 165; Schwabl, "Aufbau," pp. 177-78; cf. Apollodorus 2.3.1 (citing Hesiod as his authority); Hydra, by West, "Theogony," pp. 254-55; Abramowicz, "Quaestiunculae," p. 167; and Keto, by Siegmann, "Xilpatpa," p. 756; Lemke, "Beobachtungen," p. 52; and Hamilton, Architecture, pp. 91-92. At Th. 326, the mother of the Phix and the Nemean lion is identified as Echidna by Wilamowitz, "Herak- les," 3:260; Marg, Hesiod, p. 167; and Schwabl, "Aufbau," p. 183; cf. Apollodorus 3.5.8; Chimaera: Abramowicz, "Quaestiunculae," p. 167; Siegmann, "Xipatpa," p. 756; West, "Theogony," p. 256; Hamil- ton, Architecture, p. 91; cf. scholia at 326 (p. 62 Di Gregorio). Only Lemke, "Beobachtungen," p. 53, nominates Keto. For a summary of earlier opinions, see Abramowicz, "Quaestiunculae," p. 167.</page><page sequence="10">114 JENNY STRAUSS CLAY longer occurs in the Theogony.40 Similarly, the Hydra cannot be the sole parent of the Chimaera, because parthenogenesis only characterizes the earliest phases of cosmogony.41 But all these conclusions rest on the un- spoken assumption that the generation of monsters follows the patterns and norms laid out in the Theogony and presupposed by its whole genea- logical schema: that is, that the evolution of the cosmos progresses from a relative lack of definition and differentiation to a successively higher level of differentiation and definition. It is, however, by no means clear whether, in the case of monsters, such an assumption is warranted or whether the catalogue as a whole in fact presents such a progression. A significant indication to the contrary occurs at the very end of the catalogue. The last-mentioned member of the clan, the last-born and only son of Phorkys and Keto, the snake who guards the golden apples, is no better defined than his brethren. In fact, even less so, for the "mark of the serpent" generically characterizes the entire monster brood.42 Moreover, in striking contrast to the first-born of Keto and Phorkys, the Graiai and the Gorgons, who are assigned not only generic but individual names, in the Hesiodic text the apple-guarding serpent does not even possess a name.43 Nor, for that matter, does the lion of Nemea. By sandwiching the catalogue of monsters between two catalogues that are almost exclusively composed of names, that of the Nereids (Th. 243-63) and of the Oceanids (349-61),44 and commenting on the difficulty of knowing the names of all the rivers (Tcov ovoj' p7yaVov JavTQ)v poToV aiv6pa ?VtGEtiv / oi 6&amp; cKaToTt taaotv, oot tcptvatc-aouot, 369-70), Hesiod draws attention to the importance of naming for his theogonic enterprise. To name a thing is to assign it an individual identity. As Vernant has noted: For the Greeks, the world of the gods is organized as an other-worldly society, with its hierarchies of rank, its levels of grades and functions, its distribution of abilities and special powers. It therefore unites a multitude of individual divine figures, each possess- ing his place, role, privileges, marks of honor, particular mode of action, and sphere of intervention: in short, an individual identity. Now an individual identity has two compo- nents: a name and a body. A proper name is a particular social stamp which is attributed to a subject to mark his singularity within the species to which he belongs.... Likewise a body is what gives a subject his identity in distinguishing him through his appearance, his physiognomy, his clothing, and attributes from all who resemble him.45 40. E.g.

Muetzell, De emendatione Theogoniae hesiodeae (Leipzig, 1833), p. 463: "Etenim unum hoc est ex perpaucis exem- plum, ubi commemoratur sine nomine soboles: id quod et ab consilio genealogici carminis et ab Theogo- niae tenore sane quam multum discedit." Marg, Hesiod, p. 169 aptly notes: "Hesiod hatte ihr gut einen Namen geben konnen, wenn sie wirklich noch keinen hatte, aber er wollte es nicht." Note also, by con- trast, the explicit etymologizing of Chrysaor and Pegasus earlier in the catalogue. 44.

As we have seen, the entire brood is char- acterized by promiscuous combinations of features and qualities that are subsequently distinguished and kept apart. Multiple limbs, conflations of different animal species, hybrids of snakes and maidens, and beasts who behave like human beings no longer arise in the world we know. If, then, the monstrous creatures blur or defy the evolving categories of the or- dered universe, their very existence undermines those categories and calls into question the progressive evolution and definition of a hierarchical cosmos. In a sense, the catalogue of monsters represents an anti-cosmos that explodes the whole conception of the Theogony. In the Proem (45-46), the Muses entertain Zeus on Olympus with ac- counts of those gods ... oib Fara Kai Oi'pav6o &amp;6pi TtIKT?V, IO T' K TOV E7yVOVTO, 0&amp;0i 6WTfpEi saOv. For his own program, Hesiod insists that the Muses enlarge the scope of their song to include not only the descendants of dusky Night, but also o'v'g 0' ackLupo6 ETp-(p- fOVTOq (107). The Oco't &amp;@Tip&amp; ?aov, who distribute and choose wealth and honors and as Olympians are ultimately respon- sible for the cosmos (111-13), are the offspring of Ouranos and Gaia, the Ouraniones, as Hesiod calls them.48 The Pontides, on the other hand, de- scendants of Gaia and Pontos, can be considered anti-gods who, if left to themselves, would generate an anti-cosmos. Of course, this does not hap- pen: through intermarriage, the Pontides are rapidly integrated into the Ouranid clan. The most important representative of this assimilation is the goddess Hecate who receives "a portion of honor" from all the Ouranids (421-22) and whom Zeus honors ncp! natvTv)v (411) by assigning to her a critical mediating function in his cosmos.49 Nevertheless, with the inces- tuous, interbred, and ultimately sterile tribe of monsters, Hesiod gives us a glimpse of what such an anti-cosmos might be. Hesiod seems well aware of the destructive power of the model of his counter-cosmos represented by his monsters. By hedging in the family through endogamous unions and thus cutting it off from the theogonic mainstream, he limits and encloses the contagion of their chaotic promis- cuity. Moreover, by situating the monsters early in the Theogony, he 46. Philippson, Genealogie, pp. 9-10. 47. Cf. Clay, "Muses," p. 332. 48. Cf. Th. 461, 919, 929.

All the surviving members of the clan are integrated into Zeus' regime or rendered harmless at the ends of the earth, literally marginalized. Finally, in setting the hybrid heroes against the other hybrid monsters, Hesiod calls attention to the different kinds of giitft, the one positive and controlled, the other, destructive and disordered. As a necessary aberration, the catalogue of monsters consti- tutes, by way of counter-example, the most compelling argument for an ordered cosmos under Zeus' hegemony. 50 University of Virginia 50.
