<plain_text><page sequence="1">Oxford Review of Education, Vol. 5, No. 3, 1979 The Perfectionists and the School H.M. LEVIN Several years ago I was invited to an international conference to discuss the future of schooling. The conference convened in a lakeside villa in West Berlin that had once been the residence of Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's Minister of Propaganda. I must admit a certain misgiving about entering the halls which had probably reverberated with discussions on alternative methods for achieving the 'final solution' for my people, but I preferred to think in terms of the poetic justice by which swords are converted to ploughshares. Although the conference was attended by a large number of persons from different countries and persuasions, there were three principal participants. I will give each a fictitious name in order to avoid possible charges of libel. The three were Mr Thatcher Kohl, Mr Callaghan Palme, and Mr Benn Carillo. Mr Thatcher Kohl was a distinguished philosopher who had served as a high ranking civil servant and leading representative of the Selfserve Party of his country. Although born into a wealthy family, he perceived clearly at the age of seven that the inheritance laws would confiscate the fruits of his parents' arduous labours (at least those that had not been transferred to Swiss Banks or the Bahamas). From that point on he decided to devote himself to the quest for individual liberty and freedom so that all citizens of his country would have incentives to receive the full value of their inheritances and to promote the traditional values which had created one of the most productive civilisations in the world. After graduating from Barrow and Heidelhund, he distinguished himself as the intellectual sparkplug of the Selfserve Party, while excelling at polo and arbitrage. Among his imaginative policies was an emphasis on competitive free markets with little government interference. As he put it, the government is the enemy of the common citizen by coercing him to take services which he does not need and taxing him excessively for the privilege. He offered the National Health Service as a prime example. He also attacked other government-sponsored impediments to the free market such as trade unions, minimum wage and hour laws, and redundancy or unemployment pay. ". . . It is time that we discipline our people so that their productivity rises and the health of our industry is assured. As our businessmen must compete on world markets, so must our individual workers compete and produce if they wish to receive their daily bread. We must once again provide the incentives to entrepreneurship to create and sustain capital accumulation, for it is the benevolent engine of investment and profits on which our employment and prosperity rest." Mr Callaghan Palme had worked his way from a dustman to a shop steward in a meat packing plant to the position of chairman of the major labour confederacy of his country. Along the way he had also obtained the best academic credentials that his society offered, a true man for all seasons. Callaghan Palme became a member of his country's cabinet, when his party, the Perfectionists, were swept into power. Because of his strong ties to labour (or, as he would say, the common person), he had 251</page><page sequence="2">252 Oxford Review of Education devoted himself to improving the lot of the worker. As part of this strategy, he supported such important reforms as expansion of the national health service, improvement of the work environment and industrial relations, and male paternity leave, while never for- getting the need for maintaining the profitability of the business sector, and particularly the large corporations. He explained that the role of the Perfectionist is to make everyone happy. Capital must make profits, but not at the expense of labour. In order to carry out this difficult task, he had developed an active labour market policy which provided generous redundancy pay and retraining allowances to workers, while providing subsidies to industry. The pinnacle of his inventiveness was the social contract or national bargaining agreement which was designed to provide fair returns to both capital and labour while stemming inflation. All of these policies required high rates of personal taxation, and at the time of the Conference it appeared that the Selfserve Party of his country was probably going to defeat the Per- fectionists in the forthcoming election because of popular resentment over taxes. Mr Benn Carillo had been born of peasant stock, but his father had received the peerage for rescuing a valued game bird of the Queen from a briar patch while cleaning a cistern on her country estate. As a result, Benn Carillo had obtained a distinguished education, but he never forgot his modest roots. At twelve, he renounced the peerage in order to fight for the rights of working people, unencumbered by titles. Carillo had a dual career as both a university professor and a civil servant. Because of his elegant treatises on the logic of collective action, he became a theoretician of the Togetherness Party. His clear thinking earned him the respect of many of the young members of the Party, however, the more traditional members referred to him as expedient and dangerous to the future of inter- national togetherness. Indeed, he was considered to lack the orthodox vulgarity of a 'true' Togetherness Party member. At this stage of his career, Benn Carillo had developed a strategy for worker control of industry that had antagonised both the Traditionalists and the Perfectionists of his country. The Traditionalists thought it laughable that common workmen could aspire to be captains of industry, given their limited breeding and intelligence. The Perfectionists saw the scheme as a direct challenge to the delicate balance of happiness that only the government could achieve, and it urged the trade unions to avoid Togetherness. I am sorry to bore the reader with such details, but this background is quite important for understanding the proceedings of the meeting. Indeed, I should add that if my short descriptions of the three men do not conjure up some of their major differences, a picture of their personal styles might. Thatcher Kohl arrived at the conference in a gleaming white Mercedes, driven by a chauffeur who was dressed immaculately in a black, livery- styled suit with gold buttons. In contrast, Callaghan Palme drove to the villa himself in a Volvo. Most of us were quite shocked to see Benn Carillo arrive late in a battered I952 Volkswagen Beetle that had clearly seen better days. However, we were relieved to find that he switched to his personal Mercedes 450 SLC after conference hours. Given their worldly experience, it was astounding to discover their great spirituality. Thatcher Kohl apparently drew a distinction between those who were deserving and undeserving. God brought success to the former and failure to the latter. Indeed, God served his people as an 'invisible hand' that made certain that justice was served. To serve God, individuals had only to do their own thing. Kohl seemed to worship bees and their industriousness, constantly repeating that the "private vices of bees led to their public virtue", whatever that meant. It turns out that this had been written by a minor deity of the Selfserve Party whose major deities had names like Burke, Hobbes, Hayek, Smith and Friedman. Kohl repeatedly told the other conferees that in serving oneself, one is serving God, country and humanity (in that order).</page><page sequence="3">The Perfectionists and the School 253 Callaghan Palme was also spiritual, but he did not worship bees. Rather, he saw God as anthropomorphic, with a striking resemblance to the Cabinet Members that the Per- fectionists had chosen for their latest government. The reference point for action was always determined by what we should do to improve the world and generate the greatest happiness. It was never quite clear who the we was, but Callaghan Palme was clearly the most ecumenical participant in other ways. When queried about the meaning of Per- fectionism, he made it clear that such a view embraced all mankind and that his party had both Traditionalist and Togetherness wings. In general, he saw the 'common good' as the glue that bound his constituents together. In some ways, Benn Carillo was the most spiritual of all. He would constantly look heavenward and refer to various forces and laws of motion that had determined both the past and present and would determine the future. He also seemed to combine science more fully with his spirituality, referring to the Togetherness Party as having a scientific basis for understanding society. It was impressive to see him combine moral and scientific issues in his frequent soliloquies on objective class interests and the necessity to transform the productive apparatus that leads to worker alienation. A final word on the three principal participants is to express my admiration to them for their cordiality and manners. Although each represented a very different view of human nature, they shared the same brands of scotch and sherry. They were pleasant and could chat animately about Bach or Braque, Napoleon or John F. Kennedy. These were clearly urbane men with cultivated backgrounds and tastes and a facility for sharing both viands and ideas. Accordingly, it was with some chagrin that I learned that once the conferees were seated at the table, each seemed to speak in a mutually untranslatable language. Perhaps, even more suprising was the fact that no-one really cared, as long as each participant was able to deliver his speech on the future of schooling to the entire gathering. Furthermore, I learned that this process, inspired by the parable of Babel, had been repeated across Europe many times in recent years with the same participants, and each had not yet tired of reciting his litany for the benefit of the others. This seminar and four others were used as inputs in the preparation of the volume under review, The School in Question: a comparative study of school and its future in Western societies by Torsten Husen. Husen is clearly one of the most distinguished authorities in the world in the area of comparative education and educational psychology, and he is a master linguist as well. Furthermore, he is a person who is highly informed and is hardly parochial in interests or tastes. Yet, it is clear that he wrote a book on schooling for the Perfectionist Party. Self- serve and Togetherness adherents will hardly find their concerns reflected in its 200 pages, with the exception of gratuitious or slighting references to their views. Professor Husen has been both open and fair about this. He states unequivocally: The overall ideology which permeates this book could be labelled social liberal- ism in the tradition indicated above of commitment to the Welfare State. The emphasis is on individual self-realization within the framework of the common good and on a social control exercised by the State that calls for the establishment of institutional checks aimed at preserving the common good. (page 5) The problem is that by sifting the debate through the Perfectionist filter, one loses the diversity of the views that were expressed at the symposium and that encompass the debate on the role of schooling more generally. For example, one of the 'crises' of school- ing that was discussed at length was that of youth unemployment and 'over-education'. Essentially, this phenomenon was considered to be a crisis because in both Western Europe and the United States large numbers of youth spend a great deal of time without</page><page sequence="4">254 Oxford Review of Education productive employment, and many young persons who do obtain jobs are employed in occupations which do not require as much schooling as these persons possess. The latter is particularly characteristic for the college and university graduates of the I970s who have typically found employment at occupational levels that had been filled by secondary graduates in previous years. Both the diagnosis and the treatment of youth unemployment and over-education were viewed quite differently among the Selfserve, Perfectionist and Togetherness represen- tatives. For example, Thatcher Kohl referred to unemployed youth as 'idle' youth or those who were 'at liberty'. His view was that if these malingerers would accept a wage that reflected their true productivity, they would all be engaged in productive labour. As he repeated again and again: "...'tis better to be employed at a farthing an hour, than unemployed at a quid". His diagnosis was to get the trade unions and the government out of the market-place and to remove the dole and redundancy pay. This would solve the so-called problem of youth unemployment. With respect to over-education of the young for available jobs, he blamed this com- pletely on the Perfectionists. With their ideological commitments to equality through comprehensive secondary schools and the expansion of higher education, they had vio- lated the laws of both science and commerce. (These were referred to by the Perfectionists as the Selfserve twin deities, Shaman and Mammon.) With respect to science, Thatcher Kohl referred to the work of a distinguished educational psychologist, Sybil Curt, who had established the heritability of intelligence through his famous studies of identical twins who had been separated at a young age and raised in different environments. Curt had found that differences in environment had a very small impact on intelligence in comparison with differences in breeding. Indeed, the Selfservers noted that this was one of the most solid findings in the social sciences, with precisely the same results regardless of which methodology, sample, or data were used-as long as Professor Curt were the investigator. They concluded that education was much too good for many of today's youth, since such ruffians could not benefit from upper secondary or higher education due to their limited capacities. Accordingly, over-education was a misnomer, and the correct term should be over-credentialled. In addition to science, the Selfservers invoked the sacred laws of commerce or the market. The labour market rewards individuals according to their contribution to the productive process. Accordingly, the type of job received by educated persons and the level of remuneration are factors beyond the control of both employers and employees. But, the egalitarian tendencies of the comprehensive secondary and higher educational reforms had reduced the barriers to more schooling as well as raising the expectations of students with respect to jobs and incomes. Particularly harmful are the subsidies provided by government for both upper secondary school and the university. Thatcher Kohl be- lieved that reducing such subsidies would raise the costs of attending upper secondary schools and post-secondary institutions adequately to reduce the 'surplus' of educated persons. As he put it, "... let us replace the present social engineering approaches with an approach to education that distinguishes persons according to their capacity and that relies upon the marketplace for determining how many will be educated". Callaghan Palme and the Perfectionists disagreed profoundly with this analysis. In a society that addresses the 'common good' one cannot let the vagaries of the market determine either educational policy or the employment possibilities for educated persons. With respect to youth unemployment, they argued that the state must take an active role in both educational policy and in labour markets to assure that there is an adequate demand and remuneration for trained and educated labour. Since the Husen book is based upon these premises, the recommendations for addressing the issues are discussed in</page><page sequence="5">The Perfectionists and the School 255 substantial detail. With respect to youth unemployment and the transition of youth from education to work, the Perfectionists would emphasise an expansion of work-study programmes and a greater "real work orientation" (page I56). Furthermore, the youth unemployment would be alleviated by "... a system where they are gradually placed in jobs which for some time have to be subsidized at public expense" (page 163). The Perfectionists also had the most efficient approach to solving the problem of over-education, simply excising the word from the language. According to Husen; "... the expression is misleading and ... the problem is essentially one of underemploy- ment. It is a problem of making better use of the educated and of redesigning jobs so as to meet better the over-all educational qualifications of job seekers" (page I55). Again, action of the government is required to provide both job subsidies in the private sector, more public employment, and training and retraining programmes to create qualified employees. Recurrent education and training programmes are also called for in order constantly to refresh and upgrade the skills of the existing work force. Presumably, employers need only to be urged to improve the skill content of jobs and worker par- ticipation in the firm in order to provide challenges for educated workers. Finally, the emphasis on training allowances and subsidies must continue, and no-one should be expected to take a market-place wage that would require a severe sacrifice of living standard. As Callaghan Palme viewed both educational and social policy, there is virtually no limit to what intelligent civil servants and politicians can do to solve what are essentially pragmatic problems. The world can be controlled by intelligent policy makers, but they must ask the right questions and have the wisdom and data to answer them in a way that the common good will be served. In recognition of these premises of the Perfectionists, Husen wrote a concluding section to the book that refers to the responsible use of this awesome power (pages I79-I80). Each of some eight questions is phrased; 'How do we establish... or how do we reshape .. ?' Virtually all are premised on the view that the important decisions affecting the schools are within our control. Benn Carillo and the other Togetherness representatives were in sharp disagreement with the analysis of both Selfservists and Perfectionists on the issues of youth unemploy- ment and over-education. In fact, the Togetherness Party adherents were in sharp dis- agreement with each other. From what I could ascertain, all saw the problems of youth unemployment and over-education rising from the needs of monopoly capitalism for a reserve army of labour. The large number of unemployed and over-qualified workers, it was argued, create conditions under which each worker sees himself as fortunate to have a job or to have steady work. Furthermore, the possibility of promotion up the job pyramid depends on few rising, so workers are placed increasingly in a competitive and antagonistic position to each other. This phenomenon increases both worker discipline and disunity among workers, enhancing the extraction of a labour surplus and the rate of profits and capital accumulation. As labour discipline rises, so does labour productivity; and as disunity increases, the potential confrontation of capital by workers is reduced. At the same time, the competition for jobs increases the incentives to obtain higher educational credentials. Simply to get an edge on one's colleague in the job market, one must obtain more and more education. Thus, the levels of unemployment of school leavers and under-employment of university graduates stimulates the demand for further education, since the probability of obtaining better jobs is dependent increasingly on moving farther up the educational ladder. Furthermore, the schools were viewed by the Togetherness representatives as having a dual role in which they both must prepare the young for dreary and alienated work roles under the control of monopoly capitalism while representing the one hope for social mobility within that capitalist system.</page><page sequence="6">256 Oxford Review of Education However, beyond this the Togetherness participants were in conflict. It appeared that Benn Carillo and his ilk were in favour of schemes of worker control and nationalisation of industry, on the basis that if the capitalist system could not provide adequate numbers of meaningful jobs then the state and the workers could. It was also expected that by getting workers on Boards of Directors of firms, employment and job characteristics could be improved according to Benn Carillo. Furthermore, the experience of workers participating in the governance of their own workplaces would contribute to the longer term Together- ness agenda of complete equality and togetherness as cooperation replaced competition. Surprisingly, the attitudes of Benn Carillo toward schooling were quite similar to those of the Perfectionists. However, Benn Carillo saw the problems of youth unemployment and over-education as problems of the organisation of production under monopoly capitalism rather than as problems of education. The other Togetherness group was vehement in its denunciation of what it called a 'reformist' analysis. Its view seemed to be that any effort to reduce the reserve army of labour or the proletarianisation of university graduates will just serve to delay the historic confrontation of the capitalist class by workers. These participants seemed to revel in the predictions of rising rates of youth unemployment and over-education, and they kept repeating that the path of historic destiny should proceed unimpeded. In fact, they seemed ready to come to fisticuffs with the Benn Carillo group over their protective stance towards non-intrusion on the path of destiny. Few of these debates will be found in the Husen book. Rather, it is a volume that will appeal primarily to Perfectionists, Selfservists and Togetherness types will find it irrele- vant. More than that, even within the Perfectionist world, the diagnosis of the problems of the schools and the prescriptions for their salvation are unduly narrow and pedestrian. The daily challenges faced by Perfectionists in carrying out the recommendations are never addressed. For example, a strong plea is made for reducing the bureaucratic life of the schools by 'de-institutionalising' them and making them more sensitive to human needs and to social needs and especially the world of work. Such an analysis hardly begins to recognise the origins of bureaucracy in schooling and the faithfulness of school organis- ation to the rise of bureaucratic, corporate capitalism. In fact, it may be that schools are integrated too well with the workplace, rather than the opposite diagnosis of The School in Question. In the late nineteenth century in the United States as the workplace became fragmented under the practice of scientific management, so did the schools move from a highly decentralised form of lay control to a bureaucratic and centralised institution dominated by professionals. As work became increasingly sub-divided into minute tasks to be allocated to workers according to their capabilities, schools adopted practices for cur- riculum streaming and for testing students to assign them to streams. The schools became highly standardised with a system of age grading and a common set of instructional materials for each grade and curriculum. Many of the 'modern' factory practices became embodied in the operations of schools. Further, schooling became organised into an institution in which highly regularised rules and regulations dominated educational life. Students learned to work for extrinsic rewards such as grades and promotions and the avoidance of demotions or failures rather than for the intrinsic value of the educational process. Teachers, like the bosses in the workplace, determined which students were following the rules and carrying out their activities in the manner prescribed by the curriculum and by the need for maintaining order. Thus, the schools developed in a manner parallel to the workplace, with similar modes of organisation and control. Since the Husen book does not examine the historical origins of the institutions which</page><page sequence="7">The Perfectionists and the School 257 it seeks to recreate, it tends to treat the distasteful aspects of schooling as if they were accidental by-products of what was intended. Furthermore, by not exploring the possi- bility that the schools do indeed correspond with the needs of the workplace, it is simply assumed that the educational experience is divorced from and irrelevant to the 'world of work'. But, to the degree that the schools are reproducing the social relations of production and the ideology of corporate capitalism, any effort to change schools by integrating them to a greater degree with the world of work will hardly result in any change at all. To ignore this is to ignore the central obstacle to change. It is pointless to single out for analysis each conclusion or recommendation, for it is the entire framework that ought to be questioned. Not only are competing viewpoints on each issue either ignored or given short shrift when they violate the premises of the Perfectionists, but every issue tends to be evaluated in a context that avoids both its historical roots and its structural linkages with and location within the larger society. A fuller analysis would certainly tend to challenge the optimism of the Perfectionists that the problems of the schools can be resolved largely within existing social, economic and political formations, but the reader is carefully shielded from such unpleasantness. The underlying odour of contention and dialogue is masked by the cloying perfume of happy accord. This is surely a case where the aroma of battle would have been vastly superior.</page></plain_text>
