<plain_text><page sequence="1">DETAILED SCHEDULE OF EVENTS FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1993 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. REGISTRATION and BOOK Balmer Hall EXHIBIT 314 9:00 a.m. Executive Committee Meeting TBA 10:30 -12:00 a.m. SESSION 1 (1-7) Balmer Hall 1-1 Hispanic Literature in the United States: Voices from the Past, Present and Future F, 10:30-12:00 a.m. BLM 202 Presiding Officer: Kimberly A. Kowalczyk, University of San Diego 1. Origenes de la literatura chicana. Robert Bacalski, University of San Diego. 20 minutes Las raices de la literatura chicana se extienden hasta el Siglo de Oro espafiol. 2. From New Spain to Lamex: The Writing of the Disaster in the Novels of Alejandro Morales. Wilson Neate, University of California, Irvine. 20 minutes Taking the representation of the disaster as a central concern of what may be loosely termed the postmodern aesthetic, this paper will examine the different instances of that representation in Morales' novels and explore its significance for an under- standing of his work as a whole. 3. Leroy Quintana: Readings from Selected Works. Leroy Quintana, San Diego Mesa College. 20 minutes Leroy Quintana, New Mexico's celebrated hijo del pueblo, will read selections from his works. Quintana's poetry is a poetry of his people. In it he juxtaposes past and present to create a history of his community with its weaknesses and its strengths. 1-2 Women and Literature F, 10:30-12:00 a.m. BLM 209 Presiding Officer: Sara Scott, California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo Secretary: Christine Thompson, Portland State University. 1. Claiming a Native American Identity: Zitkala-Sa and Autobiographical Strategies. Sandra Kumamoto Stanley, California State University, Northridge. 15 minutes. In her autobiographic work "Impressions of an Indian Childhood," Zitkala-Sa, one of the first Native American women to write her autobiography without the help of</page><page sequence="2">Detailed Schedule of Events 149 an interpreter or ethnographer, challenges the predominant assimilationist autobiographies and ethnographic cultural views of the late ninteenth-century. Like W.E.B. DuBois, this native American foremother eschewed a language of accom- modation and enacted an autobiographical strategy of subversion and inversion, deconstructing prevailing western ideologies. 2. Rescripting (His)tory, from the Periphery: The Theatre of Jovette Marchessault. Ellen J. Chapco and Mary-Liz Trant, University of Regina, Canada. 15 minutes. The dramatic output of the Quebec writer, Jovette Marchessault, derives almost entirely from biography. Speaking from the periphery, as a woman writer, she projects onto stage centre women artists considered to be marginal within the patriarchally-defined literary and artistic canon. In so doing, she rescripts (His)tory, restoring to these women their rightful place within the canon. 3. Taking Turns: Feminist Criticism and "The Yellow Wallpaper." Douglas Keesey, California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo. 15 minutes. A look at how revolutions in feminist criticism have led to new interpretations of Gilman's classic short story, but also at how striking aspects of Gilman's story seem themselves to have formed the impetus for some of these revolutions 4. (Re)examining Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Aurora Leigh: Insight into the Mind of a Woman Writer. Constance M. Fulmer, Pepperdine University, Malibu. 15 minutes. Elizabeth Barrett Browning's amazingly modern verse novel, Aurora Leigh, describes the growth of the mind of a woman writer who is also a self-sufficient woman. The delightful and humorous account of Aurora's successes and of her failures can help us to define our own philosophies on education, poetry, love and gender issues. 1-3 F(r)ictions of Culture in the German/Austrian Jahrhundertwende F, 10:30-12:00 a.m. BLM 301 Presiding Officer: Richard T. Gray, University of Washington 1. The Birth of the Cool: Loos, Musil, and the Politics of Interior Space in Turn-of-the-Century Vienna. Michael Jennings, Princeton Univer- sity. 20 minutes Critics have tended to associate the culture produced in Vienna around 1900 with what would later be called Kultur. The production of Robert Musil and Alfred Loos, however, offers a powerful counterposition to the reliance on organic form. I will discuss the function of interior space in two buildings by Loos and in the narrative strategies developed to represent psychological interiority in Musil's novella collec- tion of 1911, Vereinigungen. 2. Im Scheinhaften scheinhaft: Die Signifikanz des Schauspielers in Hofmannsthals Modemekritik der neunziger Jahre. Jens Rieckmann, University of California, Irvine. 20 minutes</page><page sequence="3">150 Detailed Schedule of Events Based upon an analysis of Hofmannsthal's unpublished notes on some of the actors of the Burgtheater in the 1890's, I argue that Hofmannsthal saw their acting style as analogous to his own identity crisis and that of his generation, to the phenomenon of dilettantism, and to Viennese society at the turn of the century. 3. Loss of Outline: Decadence as the Crisis of Negation. Silke-Marie Weineck, University of Pennsylvania. 20 minutes Drawing on writings by Max Nordau, Paul Borget, and several other authors of the fin de sidcle, this paper treats the controversial notion of decadence in the context of Nietzsche's rejection of Hegel, linking it to the rise of psychoanalysis as the project of recreating an outline of the human form. 1-4 Children's Literature F, 10:30-12:00 a.m. BLM 305 Presiding Officer: Angela Estes, California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo Secretary: Kathleen M. Lant, California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo 1. Desexualizing Tom Sawyer: What Really Happens in the Cave. Jerry Griswold, San Diego State University. 15 minutes. When Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher go on their "honeymoon" in McDougal's Cave, Clemens turns an opportunity for adolescent hanky panky into a moment of revulsion. As Clemens desexualized Ivanhoe and Last of the Mohicans, he converts the tunnel of love to a house of horrors. 2. 101 Dalmatians: Fertility Versus Sterility and Economic Success. Claudia R. Myers, University of California, Berkeley. 15 minutes. The differences between Dodie Smith's 101 Dalmatians and Walt Disney's film version of the book are an alembic for American attitudes toward sexuality, reproductive capacity, and economic success. 3. Connections to Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker: The Child in a Post-Nuclear World. Norma W. Goldstein, Western Washington University. 15 minutes. Riddley Walker powerfully presents the child figure exploring a decayed, post- nuclear holocaust world and serves thematically as a corollary to several of the writer's fifty-plus children's books. 4. Ecological Criticism: Home and the Green World of Children's Literature. Janice E. Patten, San Jose State University. 15 minutes. Jonathan Bate's Romantic Ecology not only challenges Marxist and Post-structuralist readings of Romantic texts, but also offers provocative readings of children's books. Reading children's literature renews our links-both for adults and for children- between our inner world of imagination, memory, and self and the external world of Nature.</page><page sequence="4">Detailed Schedule of Events 151 1-5 Italian Critical Theory F, 10:30-12:00 a.m. BLM 306 Presiding Officer: Pasquale Verdicchio, University of California, San Diego 1. Hybridizations of Consciousness: Entrustment, Julia, and Italian Feminism. Serena Anderlini. 18 minutes An "Italian feminist" reading of a Hollywood film released in 1976, Julia, in which a highly controversial episode from the memoirs of the American playwright Lillian Hellman was narrated. Italian feminism has developed a theory of entrustment to explain some relations between women. Entrustment, from the Freudian concept of sublimation of sexual energy that enables relationships among women, claims such relationships as "good investments" in the context of patriarchal and capitalist economies that deem them poor investments. 2. Foscolo's Thanatological Sonnets: Back to the Body of the Mother. Margaret Brose, University of California, Santa Cruz. 18 minutes The thanatological tropes in Foscolo's youthful sonnets (1802-03) present the dream of death as a re-entry into the body of the mother-nation. The return, possible only through death or its surrogate, poesis, is a return as well to a "presymbolic" mode of signification. 3. Disease as Metaphor: Some Italian Autobiographies during the Pre-Romantic and Romantic Periods. Maria O. Marotti, University of California, Santa Barbara. 18 minutes In several autobiographies written at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, disease seems to create a metaphorical language. Taking Susan Sontag's work on the metaphorical use of disease and Francesco Orlando's study of the emergence of repression in the literary text as my starting points, I intend to examine Vittorio Alfieri's and Silvio Pellico's autobiographies. 1-6 English Literature Since 1700 F, 10:30-12:00 a.m. BLM 309 Presiding Officer: Carola Kaplan, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona Secretary: Leila May, University of California, Berkeley 1. Desire, Domestic Space, and the Detective in Bleak House. Kathleen Lonsdale, University of Southern California. 15 minutes. This paper suggests an antithetical relationship between female storytelling or narrative and the primarily masculine agenda of the traditional mystery plot in Charles Dickens' Bleak House. The locus for much of this conflict is in the liminal space between the domestic and the public, as well as the liminal space between the two competing narratives in the novel.</page><page sequence="5">152 Detailed Schedule of Events 2. Economic Individualism and the Female Body: Emerging 'Middles' in Adam Bede. Eileen C. Cleere, Rice University. 15 minutes. The problem of Hetty Sorrel's invisible pregnancy has been well documented by literary critics. This paper situates the pregnant body at the center of the discourse of economic individualism in Adam Bede, arguing that Hetty's emerging, unack- nowledged 'middle' becomes an icon of the emerging middle class. 3. Overwriting: Sensation Fiction and Genre Trouble in Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White. Rebecca Stem, Rice University. 15 minutes. This paper focuses on the relation between overwriting (in the sense of writing over, or revision) and overwriting (in a second sense, namely that condemnation frequent- ly associated with pulp fiction). In The Woman in White, Wilkie Collins plays upon the double entendre of the term "overwriting," and in the process reveals the political implications of genre. 4. Poisonous Pedagogy: Fathers and Sons in Frankenstein. Andrew I. Moss, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. 15 minutes. Recent psychoanalytic and feminist criticism of Frankenstein has examined power relationships within the bourgeois family as well as the workings of patriarchal ideology in science, language, and the public sphere. Considered in the light of Mary Shelley's own readings of Rousseau's Emile and Confessions, the novel offers some- thing more: a subtle critique of father-son relationships, and the way these relation- ships are constructed by conflicting narratives of self-sacrifice and disinterested love. 1-7 Linguistics and Poetry: The Craft of Language Revisited F, 10:30-12:00 a.m. BLM 312 Presiding Officer: Marilyn Maness Mehaffy, University of California, Riverside 1. Materiality, Ideology, and Subjectivity in Judy Grahn's 'The woman in three pieces.' Lynn Bastida Tullis, University of Oregon. 15 minutes. Engaging Antony Easthope's analysis of poetry as discourse and Emile Benveniste's discussion of pronouns as "the first step in [the] bringing out of subjectivity in language," I will analyze this poem from Grahn's collection, The Work of A Common Woman to show how it foregrounds the operations of discourse by highlighting the materiality of language and the construction of subjectivity. 2. The Heart of What?: White Space as Ethos in "12 O'Clock News" D. L. Garber, University of California, Riverside. 15 minutes. Elizabeth Bishop's poem poses a challenge to U.S. isolationism, a challenge lodged in the white space at the work's heart. I want to examine how this critiques and confirms Nietzsche's position that there are no relata, only relations. 3. 'My Voys and I Am At Discord': Middle English Lyric and the Poetics of Anxiety. Michael Near, Occidental College. 15 minutes. Often celebrated for a kind of earthy practicality and disarming directness, the Middle English lyric might also be seen to maintain a darker world of intense and</page><page sequence="6">Detailed Schedule of Events 153 often intensely disturbing psychological complexity. Operating by means of linguis- tic disjunction and discursive fragmentation, the lyric gives voice to a pervasive anxiety of the poetic subject confronted with the epistemological uncertainties of the late Middle Ages. 4. Writing At the Tip of the Tongue: A Poet Explores the Limitations of Her Medium. Jayne Relaford Brown, San Diego State University. 15 minutes. Ironically, we poets often focus our writing efforts on aspects of life where we have already found language inadequate. We revise moments when we were rendered speechless; we search for fresh words for love; we speak on topics "unspeakable." A poet examines her encounters with the limits of language. 1:00 - 2:30 p.m. SESSION 2 (1-7) Balmer Hall 2-1 Gender Studies and the Spanish Theatre in the Golden Age F, 1:00-2:30 BLM 305 Presiding Officer: A. Robert Lauer, University of Wisconsin 1. Gender and the Speech of Love in Ruiz de Alarc6n's El examen de maridos. Everett W. Hesse, San Diego State University. 15 minutes. Ruiz de Alarc6n's El examen de maridos is a remarkable play not only because it champions the privilege of a woman to select her own husband without outside interference but also because it reveals the behavioral problems arising in courtship. This paper analyzes the discourses of love using Speech-Act Theory. 2. Gender Anxieties in El alcalde de Zalamea. Carolyn Morrow, Univer- sity of Utah. 15 minutes. This paper gives a political reading of Calder6n's treatment of women in El alcalde de Zalamea. It examines the seventeenth-century's changing norms for women, emerging forms of femininity, and the tensions caused by more fluid codes of conduct. The questions investigated intersect with broader issues of gender con- struction. 3. Erotic Temptation and Heroic Resistance in El mayor encanto amor. Judith A. Whitenack, University of Nevada. 15 minutes. This paper examines Calder6n's idiosyncratic rendering of the episode of the hero and the enchantress, conventional in heroic literature from the time of Homer. This intertextual study focuses primarily on El mayor encanto amor, with brief references to El jardin de Falerina and Polifemo y Circe. 4. Coriolanus and Calder6n's Matronalia. Susana Hernindez Araico, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. 15 minutes. This play has been seen as a Baroque conflation of the Coriolanus myth and the rape of the Sabine women. Redating the play's composition allows reading it as a courtly Matronalia in praise of the three Spanish queens through whom the elderly Calder6n hopes the defunct Spanish monarchy might continue.</page><page sequence="7">154 Detailed Schedule of Events 2-2 Myth of the Solitary Poet: Non-Canonical Poets of British Romanticism F, 1:00-2:30 BLM 306 Presiding Officer: John G. Pipkin, Rice University 1. The Literary Canon and the Female Byron. Richard Menke, Stan- ford University. 15 minutes In addition to investigating Laetitia Elizabeth Landon's influence on Christina Rossetti, this paper also examines L.E.L.'s own poetics, her place in the literary marketplace of England in the 1820's and 1830's, and the significance of her nick- name, "the female Byron," at a time when Byronism was a European obsession. 2. "Thought-sick and Tired of Controversy": Charles Lamb's Early Poetry and the Literary Marketplace. Dwight P. Davidson, Miami University. 15 minutes. This paper examines Charles Lamb's early poetry, paying particular attention to his contributions to Coleridge's Poems on Various Subjects (1796) and Poems (1797), in an attempt to reconstruct Lamb's radical critique of Coleridge's theodicy and a cor- responding critique of sentimental writing. 3. A History of the Beautiful: Felicia Hemans's Aesthetic of the Human Moment. Elizabeth A. Dolan, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 15 minutes This paper seeks to define Felicia Heman's position in debates about issues that characterize "Romantic Culture." Hemans confronts the male Romantic aesthetic of the beautiful by subtly resisting the enshrinement of art that does not include the human moment or that is revered at the expense of historical context. 4. Two "Psyches": Aesthetics, Authorship, and the Gaze. Janna Knittel, University of Oregon. 15 minutes Juxtaposing Mary Tighe's Psyche, or the Legend of Love and John Keats's "Ode to Psyche," this paper examines the extent to which both poems eroticize the figure of Psyche and argues that the traces of violence in Tighe's text reveal a criticism of conventional gender relations that Keats's poem lacks. 2-3 Appropriation and Identity: The Art of Self-creation F, 1:00-2:30 BLM 309 Presiding Officer: Wilfrid R. Koponen, Stanford University 1. A Genius at Living: D.H. Lawrence's Personal and Artistic Battle with Illness. Wayne Templeton, University of British Columbia. 15 minutes Needing to compensate for the debilitating symptoms of the tuberculosis from which he suffered, and which he denied having, D.H. Lawrence developed a philosophy, based upon the power of the will, which he applied in his attempts to recreate his own identity and to formulate a new theory of characterization.</page><page sequence="8">Detailed Schedule of Events 155 2. The Appropriation of Feminine Writing: Anais Nin's 'June' Portraits," Lynette Felber, New Mexico State University. 15 minutes Anais Nin's claims to be the innovator of a feminine prose deserve consideration in the wake of French feminists' call for an ecriture feminine. By appropriating the identity of a feminine writer, however, Nin may have excluded herself from both traditional and feminist canons, contributing to her own literary marginality. 3. Stealing a Self: 'Survivorhood' and Authority in Sharon Olds' Poetry. Celia Carlson-De Spain, University of California, Berkeley. 15 minutes In her poetry Sharon Olds appropriates the status of "survivor" in order to establish superior moral authority for her poetic voice. However, her poems perpetuate the very power structures she affects to decry. Olds inadvertently gives us insights into the risks of constructing one's identity upon a claim to victimization. 4. Storytelling in Louise Erdrich: Beyond Self-Construction to Cultural Survival. Edwin Stein, Jr., Whitman College. 15 minutes. Through the act and theme of storytelling Erdrich creates, not a self as typically understood in Western terms (a psychological essence evolved through inner dis- coveries and outer experiences) nor a mere type, but a third form of persona combining individual and community identity and capable of securing cultural survival. 2-4 Germanics F, 1:00-2:30 BLM 312 Presiding Officer: Wolfgang Nehring, UCLA Secretary: Gerhard Hoffmeister, University of California, Santa Barbara 1. Freiheit und Fatalismus: Conrad Ferdinand Meyers 'Renaissancismus' und die Grtinderzeit. Monika Sudjian, Occidental College. 20 minutes Die Renaissance und die Griinderzeit sind Obergangsperioden, in denen sich das Geschichtsbewujltsein neu orientiert, wihrend eine veraltete Weltanschauung weiterwirkt, was sich in dem Gegensatz zwischen Freiheit und Fatalismus ausdrUckt. Die Beziehungen zwischen den Epochen (in Wissenschaft, Philosophie und Kunst) erklAren viele Spannungen im literarischen Werk C.F. Meyers. 2. Christoph Heins Drachenblut: Der Traumprolog als Provokation an den Leser. Dieter Sevin, Vanderbilt University, 20 minutes Die Traumvision, die dem Haupttext von Drachenblut vorausgeht, wurde von der Kritik kaum beriicksichtigt. Sie kann aber als der eigentliche ErzAhl- und SchreibanlaSl der Ich-Erzahlerin gelten, und sie gibt dem ganzen Roman eine tiber den nuichtern realistischen Protokollstil hinausgehende allegorische Dimension. 3. Altern Am Pazifik-Der Mann von Funfzig Jahren in Kalifornien. Romey Sabilius, Utah State University. 20 minutes</page><page sequence="9">156 Detailed Schedule of Events Die Protagonisten der Romane Altern von Walter Vogt, Herbst in der Grofen Orange von Hugo Loetscher und Brandung von Martin Walser werden in Kalifornien mit ihrem fortgeschritten Alter konfrontiert. Dies ist ein direktes Resultat der Begeg- nung mit der fremden Kultur. Unterschiede und Gemeinsamkeiten in den Texten sollen unter individual-psychologischen, national-imagologischen und literaturhis- torischen Gesichtspunkten dargestellt werden. 2-5 Classics: Greek F, 1:00-2:30 BLM 303 Presiding Officer: Jennifer Wheat, University of California, Santa Cruz Secretary: Pamela Vaughn, California State University, Fresno 1. Hesiod's Works and Days as Public Performance Piece. Sandy Wes- tover, University of Southern California. 15 minutes. This paper, focussing on the creation of Pandora and the fable of the hawk and the nightingale, explores the possibility that Hesiod's Works and Days constitutes an illocutionary act; that is, that is was intended for public performance. 2. Simaetha's complaint: Female Voice in Theocritus' Idyll II and Beyond. Melinda Weinstein, University of California, Santa Cruz. 15 minutes. This paper examines the performance of female voice in Theocritus' Idyll II in the context of an Alexandrian aesthetic that emphasizes voice, performance and parody. Analysis of these issues indicates that misogynistic norms latent in Alexandrianism can be abstracted from such histrionic "self-representations." 3. Parthenos Ergane and Lysistratos: Athene and her Arts in Aristophanes' Lysistrata. Victor Castellani, University of Denver. 15 minutes. Athene's women's arts dominate agones between the choruses, then between the title character and the Proboulos, Strikingly contrasted is the men's sacrilege (abuse of olive wood, fire brought to the goddess' doorway) with the women's loyal work (washing, baths, yarn making). "Lysistratos"may be a cult title of Athena. 4. Writing Lies in the Bellerophon Episode (Iliad 6.156 ff.). Karen Bassi, University of California, Santa Cruz. 15 minutes. This paper examines the threat to Greek masculine identity posed by writing or mediated speech in the Bellerophon episode, reaching the conclusion that Attic drama developed in response to that threat. 2-6 East West Relations F, 1:00-2:30 BLM 201 Presiding Officer: Hongchu Fu, UCLA Secretary: K.D. Verma, University of Pittsburg</page><page sequence="10">Detailed Schedule of Events 157 1. Knowledge and Reality in Goethe's Faust and Aurobindo's Savitri. K. D. Verma, University of Pittsburgh. 20 minutes Whereas Goethe's Faust is more or less a dramatization of the Kantian view of knowledge and reality, Savitri is a poetization of Aurobindo's vision of the realiza- tion of the Absolute through a process of knowledge. This paper attempts to compare the two poetic views of knowledge and reality. 2. Jacques Lacan and the Oriental Geography of Psychoanalysis. Richard Serrano, University of California, Berkeley. 20 minutes This paper examines Lacan's references to non-Western cultures in "The Function and Field of the Word and Language," in particular his use of non-Western lan- guages to articulate the concept of the unconscious as language. 3. Han Shan and Schopenhauer: Aestheticism and Asceticism as Deliverance. Sheng-Tai Chang, University of Southern California. 20 minutes This paper examines Han Shan's poetry and Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation and discovers affinities between the two authors. Han Shan and Schopenhauer are genealogically related through Indian philosophy, particularly Buddhism. Contemporary American interest in Han Shan bespeaks the cultural conditions of American society, to which Schopenhauer is also relevant. 2-7 Literature and the Other Arts F, 1:00-2:30 BLM 207 Presiding Officer: Crystal Downing, UCLA Secretary: Janice Patten, San Jose State University 1. Urban Transformation and Literary Representation in Modern Paris: Zola and the Haussmannian Rational Construct. Michael J. D'Andrea, University of Southern California. 20 minutes An analysis of Parisian boulevards and structures unveils the capacity of Zola's prose in L'Assommoir to express individual alienation in modern urban existence. Zola undermines the rational means and ideological forces behind the Napoleon III / Haussmann transformation of Paris, conjuring the great avenues and lofty new buildings as tropes for personal experience, memory, and decline. 2. Cityful Passing Away, Other Cityful Coming: James Joyce and the Image of the City. Desmond Harding, University of Southern Califor- nia. 20 minutes In Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Ulysses, Joyce constructs a semiotics of the city in which the particular contains the universal; played out within the public and private spaces of Dublin's topography, the terms conditioning lived city "experience" oscillate within a debilitating binary of frustration and entrapment.</page><page sequence="11">158 Detailed Schedule of Events 3. The Piercing of Safety: Suburban Decay in the Work of Eric Fischl and A.M. Homes. Genevieve Later, University of Washington. 20 minutes This paper describes the paradox at the heart of suburbia: in the midst of plenty there is instead isolation and loss. The juxtaposition of the paintings of Eric Fischl and the short stories of A.M. Homes elucidates, visually and verbally, the clash between economic prosperity and emotional lack that is so much a part of contem- porary American experience. 2:45 - 4:15 p.m. SESSION 3 (1-7) Balmer Hall 3-1 Mexican Women Writers F, 2:45-4:15 p.m. BLM 305 Presiding Officer: Agnes L. Dimitriou, University of California, Berkeley 1. Examining Women's Autobiography in California, 1769-1880. Vir- ginia Bouvier, University of California, Berkeley. 15 minutes This paper looks at the sources that allow us to recreate the history of women in past periods and what these sources tell us of women's lives. The documents and periodi- cals examined for the study reveal different images of Spanish and Mexican women. 2. Hibridez Generica en la Obra de Guadalupe Loaeza. Myrna Garcia- Castanon, University of Wisconsin at Madison. 15 minutes Guadalupe Loaeza irrumpi6 en la escena literaria mexicana en 1987 con uno de los mayores 6xitos editoriales con Las nifias bien. Al igual que en sus libros subsiguientes, Las reinas de Polanco y Primero las damas, estos textos se presentan como cuentos, pero hay un alto grado de contaminaci6n gen~rica a lo largo de sus paginas. Aquf se explora esa contaminaci6n gendrica cultivado con gran 6xito en ahios recientes. 3. The Interplay of Text and Image in Poniatowska's Tinfsima. Susan Schaffer, UCLA. 15 minutes This study on Tinisfma, Poniatowska's most recent publication, involves the relation- ship between photography and what I term the 'micro' and 'macro' vignettes that comprise the novel. What is particularly interesting is how discourse in Tinistma is informed and shaped by the photos that appear in the novel. This text is a reflection and extension of her earlier works that are based on visual images. 4. A Poet's Subversion. Juan Delgado, California State University, San Bernardino. 15 minutes Silvia Tomasa Rivera addresses the issue of the woman poet as outsider. To this end her use of understatement is not only a poetic tool, but a subversive strategy to undermine the conventional poetics of a male literary establishment. Her aesthetic use of understatement validates and affirms the "other."</page><page sequence="12">Detailed Schedule of Events 159 3-2 Autobiography F, 2:45-4:15 p.m. BLM 306 Presiding Officer: Chris Thompson, Portland State University Secretary: Sondra Reid, University of California, Davis 1. Miguel Antonio Otero and Nina Otero-Warren: Public Autobiog- raphy and Ethnic Identity. Margaret Garcia Davidson, University of California, Davis. 15 minutes Chicano/a autobiography does not comfortably fit the usual parameters of ethnic biography as the transformation from an ethnic to an American identity. Miguel A. Otero and Nina Otero-Warren demonstrate the tension between public and private self that shapes the ways in which culture and ethnicity are inscribed as a complex subtext when "writing the self." 2. In the Humble Service of Her Emancipation: Hannah Cullwick's Maid-of-All-Work-Diaries. Martha Dana Rust, California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo. 15 minutes A postcolonialist analysis of Victorian maidservant Hannah Cullwick (1833-1909). Cullwick's diaries, which were written at the request of the upper-class, elitist Arthur Munby, constitute the nexus both of her oppression and of her struggle to dismantle and reshape her identity. 3. Defining Women's Roles in Soviet Women's Prison Memoirs. Janice Chernekoff, University of California, San Diego. 15 minutes Soviet women's prison memoirs evidence an evaluation of women's social and political roles which results in a nostalgic reclamation of the institution of mother- hood and the domestic world for women. Suffering under the burden of un-looked- for, additional social and political responsibilities, they visualize relief in a return to a less "emancipated" society. 4. Reproduction of a Bodied Voice: The Poetic Text as a Form of Resistance in The Little School. Perrin Kerns, University of Eugene, Oregon. 15 minutes In examining Partnoy's use of the poetic in her torture narrative, I argue that what is at stake for Partnoy in her text is language itself. In the "little school," where the body comes into immediate conflict with the systems of power, Partnoy suggests that meaning collapses and language reveals itself to be, like torture, one of the tools with which the power systems socially code the body. 3-3 Scandinavian Literature F, 2:45-4:15 p.m. BLM 309 Presiding Officer: Jan SjAvik, University of Washington Secretary: Susan Spencer, University of Central Oklahoma 1. Privacy Outlawed: The Negation of Grief in Njal's Saga. Miles J. Efron, Occidental College. 15 minutes</page><page sequence="13">160 Detailed Schedule of Events 2. Utopia and the Everyday World: C. J. L. Almqvists's Det gdr an and the Polemic Essays. Lori Ann Ingalsbee, UCLA. 15 minutes. 3. Isak Dinesen: Gender and Narrative. Marianne Stecher Hansen, University of Washington. 15 Minutes. 3-4 The German Novelle: Its Genesis and Purport F, 2:45-4:15 p.m. BLM 312 Presiding Officer: Clifford A. Bernd, University of California, Davis 1. 'Anleitung, was Sie fiUr den Merkur schreiben sollen': Wielands Novellentheorie in einem unbekannten Brief an Sophie von LaRoche. Hildburg Herbst, Rutgers University. 15 minutes Anhand eines Briefes von Wieland an Sophie von LaRoche aus dem Jahr 1780 ist zu beweisen, daf3 Wieland alles Wesentliche der spAiteren Novellentheorie bereits fiinfzehn Jahre vor Goethes Unterhaltungen deutscher Ausgewanderten schriftlich fixierte und somit derjenige war, der die Novelle in ihrer heutigen Gattungsdefini- tion in die deutsche Literatur einfiihrte. 2. Xenophilia and Xenophobia in the German Novelle: The Case of Keller's Don Correa. Gail Hart, University of California, Irvine. 15 minutes Despite its orientation toward novelty, the Novelle is rather conservative when it comes to the novelty of foreigners, tending rather to demonize than absorb cultural outsiders. Keller's narrative of colonial conquest is an exception in that it addresses the xenophobic acts of invasion and conquest and the xenophilia that follows conquest. 3. Dekadenz und Novelle: Zur Erzahlproblematik Eduards von Keyserlings. Wolfgang Nehring, UCLA. 15 minutes Das Paper untersucht den Zusammenhang von inhaltlichen und formalen Erziihlkategorien bei Keyserling: von dekadenter Adelswelt, impressionistischer Stimmungshaftigkeit und Erzibhlstruktur. Keyserlings Erzilhlungen tendieren einer- seits zum Roman, andererseits zur Kurzgeschichte. Aber das Beste leistet er in der impressionistischen Stimmungsnovelle. 4. Siegfried Lenz' Novelle Ein Kriegsende--ein moralischer Modellfall als Historiographie. Hans Wagener, UCLA. 15 minutes Siegfried Lenz' Novelle Ein Kriegsende kann nicht einfach als moralischer Modellfall zum Thema Pflicht verstanden werden; die fir Lenz auf3ergew6hnlich genaue zeitliche und geographische Fixierung des Geschehens macht vielmehr deutlich, daBl es sich um ein Paradebeispiel einer Art von fiktionaler Geschichtsschreibung hand- elt, wie er sie in seiner jiingsten Essayistik proklamiert. 3-5 Classics: Latin F, 2:45-4:15 p.m. BLM 201 Presiding Officer: Victor Castellani, University of Denver Secretary: Karen Bassi, University of California, Santa Cruz</page><page sequence="14">Detailed Schedule of Events 161 1. SINE FINE: The Aeneid and Freud's Masterplot. Robin N. Mitchell, Temple University and Center for Hellenic Studies. 15 minutes This paper investigates Vergil's narrative practice employing the Freudian model Peter Brooks developed in Reading for the Plot. Its focus on issues central to reading the Aeneid, such as the desire for the end and the function of repetition, could further explain the Aeneid's narrative economy and its disturbing ending. 2. The Dido Episode and Augustan Historical 'Progress.' Julie Hem- ker, Stanford University. 15 minutes Criticism of the Dido episode has failed to see the significance of this story for the narrative of Roman history within the Aeneid. The cyclical mutability that Dido represents under- mines the idea that a teleological purpose governs Roman historical "progress." 3. Rescuing Dido: Heroides 2 and 7. Leslie Cahoon, Gettysburg College. 15 minutes. That Heroides 2 (Phyllis to Demophoon) is as much a response to Aeneid 4 as Heroides 7 (Dido to Aeneas) has been noted by Jacobson and others. This paper offers a fuller interpretive treatment of these as a related pair, along the line of Verducci's work on Epistulae 6 and 12. 4. Hyacinthus and the Ciconian Women: Figurative Language and Metamorphosis in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Shelley D. Kaufhold, University of Utah. 15 minutes Apollo turns Hyacinthus into hyacinth, yet figurative language suggests that the youth was always a flower, before physical metamorphosis. Objective change, honoring him, appears appropriate. Later, for punishment, Bacchus changes Orpheus' slayers into trees. The text also transforms these women before physical metamorphosis. However, we "see" them "as" birds, not trees. Ovid's transforma- tions by divine pity seem appropriate, those by divine anger inappropriate. 5. Taking a Crack at Old Jokes and Stereotypes in Satire 6: Resisting Juvenal, Barbara K. Gold, Hamilton College. 15 minutes Satire 6 is a test case for investigating how Juvenal makes points about social conditions, and for asking how Juvenal, participating in and yet ostensibly resisting and ironizing the anti-woman tradition, cleverly constructs (while pretending to problematize) gender norms which both reflect and contribute to Roman (and contemporary) social categories. 3-6 French Literature F, 2:45-4:15 p.m. BLM 207 Presiding Officer: Elisabeth A. Marlow, University of Oregon Secretary: Pary Pezechkian-Weinberg, Loyola Marymount University 1. Fabre d'Eglantine, Robespierre, and the Misanthrope: Theatricality and the French Revolution. Susan Maslan, Johns Hopkins University. 15 minutes</page><page sequence="15">162 Detailed Schedule of Events This paper counters the widespread critical tendency to treat revolutionary politics as theatrical and revolutionary theater as purely political. A reading of Fabre d'Eglantine's 1790 rewriting of the Misanthrope, and of Robespierre's violent reaction to it show that "theatricality" generated considerable anxiety for both politics and the theater. 2. Catharsis in C6line's 'War Trilogy'. Vdronique Flambard-Weisbart, Loyola Marymount University. 15 minutes The desire for catharsis in C61ine's "War Trilogy" goes beyond the poetical act. The sense of sympathy felt at the reading of his work is symptomatic. Although Cfline would like to make believe that his style is the only subject of the "trilogy", he reappears as the subject of his narrative. 3. Balthazar et le probl~me de l'image. Pary Pezechkian, UCLA. 15 minutes Dans son roman, Gaspard, Melchior et Balthazar, Michel Tournier pr~sente un point de vue original sur les relations qui existent entre l'image et le signe. Il choisit un sujet religieux connu, l'histoire des rois mages, pour nous proposer une nouvelle interpretation des origines de l'art et du langage. 3-7 Beowulf &amp; Related Topics F, 2:45-4:15 p.m. BLM 213 Presiding Officer: Gayle Henrotte, University of La Verne Secretary: Frank Battaglia, College of Staten Island 1. Werwulf, the Mercian Author of Beowulf. Fidel Fajardo-Acosta, Creighton University. 20 minutes. This paper claims that Beowulf was composed by Werwulf, a Mercian scholar in the service of King Alfred the Great sometime after 885. Both internal/philological evidence and external/historical evidence are offered to support this claim. 2. Was Beowulf Composed in the Late West Saxon 'Schrift-sprache'? Herbert Penzl, University of California, Berkeley. 20 minutes The dating of Beowulf has remained controversial since the 1880s. Its content favors an early composition before the Viking invasions into still pagan England, in an area with a supportive royal court. This paper examines linguistic evidence (e.g. C. Chase, Toronto, 1981) for an earlier Anglian version of the West Saxon manuscript text. 3. Portmanteau Words in Beowulf. Raymond P. Tripp, Jr., University of Denver. 20 minutes. Klaeber uniformly emends hraerg to haerg (175b) and heand to hand (2596b) in his edition of Beowulf. This paper reexamines the earlier manuscript forms as possible linguistic blends. Early nineteenth century editors tended to be literal in their interpretations of the poem, emending verbal forms to fit the story; the manuscript forms of the terms discussed here are dearly different from the edited ones.</page><page sequence="16">Detailed Schedule of Events 163 FORUM: F, 4:30 -6:00 p.m. KANE 210 THE LITERARY TEXT AND THE EUROPEAN LEGACY: CHANGING PARADIGMS OF THOUGHT Prof. Ernst Behler, University of Washington Prof. Raymond Fleming, Pennsylvania State University Prof. Marjorie Perloff, Stanford University Prof. George Slusser, University of California, Riverside Moderator: Prof. Jean-Pierre Barricelli, University of California, Riverside Reception: F, 6:00 - 8:00 p.m..

The Race and Sex of a Nobel Laureate: La Divina Gabriela in Official Art. Elizabeth Horan, Arizona State University. 20 minutes Representations of Gabriela Mistral, Latin America's first Novel Laureate, in public art situate the poet within an ambiguous, intermediary realm with regard to racial and sexual identities. Literary criticism has created narrative accounts of the poet's life that attempt to resolve these ambiguities without overtly acknowledging them. By contrast, the aggregate Gabriela Mistral of public imagination argues for indeter- minacy and multiplicity. I survey the contradictory iconographic representation of Gabriela Mistral as embodying and negating conventions about race and sex. 2. Tecnologias del ser y los sujetos porticos de Antonio Cisneros. Jill E. Albada-Jelgersma, University of California, Davis. 20 minutes El elemento mis innovador de la poesia del escritor peruano, Antonio Cisneros (1942), es la autoreflexividad de los sujetos porticos de su discurso. Creo que en un andlisis de la poesfa de Cisneros, profundizado por los conceptos te6ricos de Michel Foucault sobre las tecnologfas del ser, se destacarAn las presentaciones innovadoras de los sujetos porticos de su obra, tanto por la calidad literaria de su perspectiva posmoderna, como por las preocupaciones del sujeto del mundo latinoamericano de los fines del siglo veinte.</page><page sequence="17">164 Detailed Schedule of Events 3. Jorge Luis Borges' Self-Translation: an Approach to Borges' Concept of Literary Creation. Dominique M. Louisor-White, California State University, San Bernardino. 20 minutes Jorge Luis Borges' concept of literary creation is best exhibited in his self-translation into English. As Borges translates Borges, free from literality and distanced from his originals, the author re-writes his own works, asserting that the nature of literary creation is in the synthesis of writing and re-writing. 4. Loca or Libre: Reinaldo Arenas and the Gay Challenge to the Left. John C. Hawley, Santa Clara University. 20 minutes 4-2 Gender and Narrative Theory St, 8:30-10:00 p.m. BLM 207 Presiding Officer: Ann ter Haar, University of California, Davis 1. Freud's Masculine Masterplot, Gender Anxiety, and the Problem of Representation: Beyond the Oedipal in Pedro Almodovar's Matador and Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. Carl Eby, University of California, Davis. 20 minutes Texts informed by gender anxiety partake largely of a bipolarity in the Oedipus complex which leads us beyond the oedipal and has important implications for representation and interpretation. I use a revision of Freud's "masterplot" of the killing of the totem animal to illuminate Almodovar's Matador and Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. 2. Terms of Contest: Bodily Inscriptions in Toni Morrison's Beloved. Leah Spence, University of Washington. 20 minutes What does it mean to "speak the unspeakable"? This paper on Toni Morrison's Beloved asks about the material effects of discourse by looking at how "the unspeak- able" (whether that term denotes the atrocities committed against the enslaved or whether it connotes a resistant language of self-creation) is inscribed on and by the bodies of the novel's major characters. 3. Dil's Unspeakable Secret: Gender Shock and/as Imperialist Nostal- gia in Neil Jordan's The Crying Game. Shantanu DuttaAhmed, Univer- sity of Southern California. 20 minutes Discussions of Jordan's The Crying Game often privilege issues of gender, eliding questions of race which are also crucial to the work. I would like to suggest, that however well intentioned, instead of disrupting gender binaries the film often reinstates them through a disturbing emotional investment in what can best be described as imperialist nostalgia. 4-3 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe St, 8:30-10:00 p.m. BLM 214 Presiding Officer: Hellmut Ammerlahn, University of Washington.</page><page sequence="18">Detailed Schedule of Events 165 1. Von der halben und ganzen Humanitait der Iphigenie. Karla Schultz, University of Oregon. 20 minutes. Iphigenie wird aus einer auf Goethe bisher wenig angewandten Perspektive unter- sucht, der Geschichtsphilosophie Theodor Adornos. Dessen Versuch, im Stick eine Humanitft jenseits gingiger Antithesen durch eine tiefere Dialektik aufzudecken, verweist gleichzeitig auf Julia Kristevas Verstdndnis des Fremden und Anderen. Eine ganze statt gezahmte halbe Humanitat erscheint in Thoas und Orest. 2. 'Da war jedem die Zunge gel6st': Reden und Schweigen in Goethes "Hermann und Dorothea." Marianne Henn, University of Alberta, Canada. 30 minutes. Die sprachliche Haltung der jiingeren und ilteren Generation in Goethes "Hermann und Dorothea" zeigt, daiB es infolge der Franz6sischen Revolution zu einem Paradig- mawechsel in der traditionellen unmiindigen Rolle der Frau kommt. Wihrend Hermanns Sprache z6gernd und unsicher ist und er 6fters ins Schweigen flieht, ist Dorothea selbstbewuftt, unabhAngig und sprachgewandt. 3. 'Gelehrtentrag6die'. A Contrastive Analysis of Goethe's Faust I and F. Pessoa's Fausto (ca 1935). Gerhart Hoffmeister, University of Califor- nia, Santa Barbara. 20 minutes. Pessoa's Fausto can be read as a lyrical variation on the form and conception of Faust I. Focusing on the 'Gelehrtentrag6die', Pessoa used the crisis of the scholar to explore his own thoughts on "genius and madness" at the turn of the century, thereby shedding more light on Goethe. 4-4 British Romantic Prose: Fact or Fiction? St, 8:30-10:00 p.m. BLM 301 Presiding Officer: Susan Spencer, University of Central Oklahoma 1. The Subject in History: William Godwin's Historical Fiction. Gary Handwerk, University of Washington. 15 minutes William Godwin's historical fiction, notably St. Leon and Mandeville, provides an essential gloss on the philosophical anarchism of his Enquiry Concerning Political Justice. As some of the earliest historical novels in the English tradition, these novels show Godwin reflecting upon the power of ideology over individual judgment from his transitional position between Enlightenment and Romantic thought. 2. Waverley and the Sublime Problem of History as Art. Keith Welsh, Webster University. 15 minutes Waverley poses the problem of the aesthetics of "History", sublime (Flora MacIvor) versus beautiful (Rose Bradwardine). This paper explores the complex nature of History as it emerges in Scott's novel. Waverley achieves a tentative repose between history and art that contains history within the realm of art and thrusts art into the problem of history. 3. Byron and The Liberal: A Periodical as Political Posture. Jonathan Gross, DePaul University. 15 minutes</page><page sequence="19">166 Detailed Schedule of Events The title of the periodical Byron edited with Leigh Hunt represents one of the earliest and most important uses of "liberal" as a noun. This essay explores Byron's move from a definition of liberalism as noblesse oblige to a revolutionary conception of the word based on struggles for sovereignty in Spain, Italy, and Greece. 4. Freedom or Nonviolence: Leigh Hunt and the Problem of Early Liberal Rhetoric. Daniel Born, Marietta College. 15 minutes Leigh Hunt's prose provides examples of liberal rhetoric in its formative stages, a rhetoric alternating between commitment to political freedom on one hand and to nonviolence on the other. The rift between these two goals of early liberalism-a rift in need of exploration today more than ever-becomes apparent when we explore Hunt's miscellaneous writings on subjects as diverse as freedom fighting in Greece, tight-lacing, and flogging. 4-5 Ancient-Modern Relations St, 8:30-10:00 p.m. BLM 305 Presiding Officer: Erin O'Connell, Stanford University Secretary: Richard Frank, University of California, Irvine 1. Jane Austen: A Female Aristotelian. John Ely, Stanford University. 15 minutes The moral outlook in Jane Austen's novels is distinctly Aristotelian, a point infre- quently observed in the critical literature, but evident in her concept of friendship and community, and her doctrine of virtues. While Aristotle has frequently been criticized with justice for his biological view of female inferiority, Austen suggests a way of looking at his Ethics in less biologistically gendered terms. 2. Machiavelli and Cicero. Richard Frank, University of California, Irvine. 15 minutes Machiavelli often refers to Roman texts, frequently to contradict them. The Discour- ses advance conclusions Livy would have deplored. The Prince quotes Cicero, then justifies exactly what Cicero condemns. The reason lies in the need for a new vocabulary. Medieval political discourse was about justice; in the Renaissance it was about power. 3. The Obsolescence of the Hero: Voltaire's Attack on Homeric Heroism. Carl A. Rubino, Hamilton College. 15 minutes The divergent messages of the Homeric epics were fused into a single heroic paradigm that Voltaire portrays as absurd. After a disastrous Iliadic encounter, Candide becomes a simple-minded Odysseus. Where Homer presents a world governed by divine order, Candide.attacks the notion that suffering makes sense when viewed as part of a cosmic order. 4. Sophocles in South Africa: Athol Fugard's The Island. Seth L. Schein, University of California, Davis. 15 minutes In The Island, two prisoners on Robben island perform Sophocles' Antigone for their fellow prisoners and captors. The action and values of Sophocles' play intensify The</page><page sequence="20">Detailed Schedule of Events 167 Island's representation of the struggle against apartheid and the state. Fugard's hero Winston, isolated and despairing, refuses the role of Antigone; then he finds the compassion and strength to play her part and his own. 4-6 Asian Literature St, 8:30-10:00 p.m. BLM 306 Presiding Officer: Sheng-Tai Chang, University of Southern California Secretary: Harb Sanghara, University of Victoria 1. Historicity of Interpretation: Reflections on Xing in Classical Chinese Poetry. Hongchu Fu, UCLA. 20 minutes. Engaging the problem of xing in its historical contexts, this paper examines three issues involved in the interpretation of a poem: the ontological status of poetry, the receptive ambience, and modes of thinking in various ages. The interplay between the three in poetry interpretation makes xing a complex phenomenon. 2. Death of Self as Figure in the Carpet. Leslie Winston, UCLA. 20 minutes. In order to fill the spiritual emptiness of the hero in A Dark Night's Passing, Shiga Naoya must write the self, which figures preeminently in most of the story, out of the text. The work operates on the inherent paradox of a self that must be erased to effect self-discovery. 3. Feminine/Feminism: Gokhale's Paro: Dreams of Passion. Rosemarie Schlegl, University of Calgary. 20 minutes. Defining one's approach to feminism becomes important for both the novel's charac- ters and critics. Gokhale's novel does not provide a resolution between "feminine" and "feminist" tensions, but describes processes by which female subjectivity has been constructed for the characters and the ways in which they attempt to construct it themselves. 4-7 Modern Drama St, 8:30-10:00 p.m. BLM 309 Presiding Officer: Deborah Thompson, Rice University Secretary: Douglas Keesey, California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo 1. Subtextual Discourse, Representation, and Pirandello's Six Charac- ters in Search of an Author. Matthew C. Roudand, Georgia State Univer- sity. 20 minutes This paper explores the subtextual language embedded in Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author. After establishing a typology of the major levels of subtextual discourse in the play, I will discuss the implications of this didascalic discourse and its relationship to textuality, dialogue, and performance in Pirandello and modem drama.</page><page sequence="21">168 Detailed Schedule of Events 2. The Nobody of Nowhere: Derek Walcott's Don Juan. D. L. Mac- Donald, University of Calgary. 20 minutes The Joker of Seville (1974), Walcott's adaptation of Tirso de Molina's El Burlador de Sevilla, introduces a motif from Homer into the Don Juan legend: Walcott's Don Juan is Nobody, "a being without interiority" (Kristeva) who spreads nothingness around him--and hence a symbol of the European conquerors of America. 3. The Productions of Space in Marguerite Duras' India Song. Padmaja Challakere, Rice University. 20 minutes This paper addresses the implications of the rhetorical stance in India Song, which both minimizes native presence and presents the experiences of a certain class--the ruling elite of the country--as the experience of a "country." In this play, places are transformed into spaces, allowing the reader to suspend time and space and define his/her own subjective space in terms of the signifying space of the text in which the real and the fictive coexist but do not correspond. It is this mythologizing and distancing textual strategy that I find ideologically most problematic. 4-8 African-American Literature St, 8:30-10:00 p.m. BLM 312 Presiding Officer: Paula Barnes, Hampton University Secretary: Isaac Johnson, Pacific Union College 1. James Weldon Johnson's Impossible Text: The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. Aldon L. Nielsen, UCLA. 20 minutes The Autobiography ofan Ex-Colored Man produces the impossibility of a stable reading of its own narrative as exemplary of the instability, the impossibility, of American racial definition. In reading Johnson's novel, we follow the narrator's reading of the text of his own life as if it were an intertext producing two radically different sets of racial significations. 2. Healing the South's 'Sin-Sick Soul': Language, History and Family in Margaret Walker's Jubilee. Australia Tarver, GMI Engineering and Management Institute. 20 minutes In Walker's hands, the South of Jubilee becomes a measure of promise and possibility. Walker's use of the transforming power of religious language demonstrates how Vyry's post-slave community is a direct contrast to the increasing divisions among advocates of nonviolence and black power, occurring at the time of the novel's publication. 3. 'My Tongue is in my Friend's Mouth': Language and Ideology in Black Women's Fiction. Cheryl L. Johnson, Miami University. 20 minutes This presentation will discuss the influences of race and gender in black women's use of language in literature. More specifically, it will focus on how women authors place the black woman's "tongue" (language) into the mouths of her "friendly" audience providing both the speaker/writer and reader/hearer with access to the black woman's ideologically-informed story.</page><page sequence="22">Detailed Schedule of Events 169 SATURDAY, 10:15 - 11.45 p.m. SESSION 5 Balmer Hall 5-1 Vision/Revision of Woman in Latin-American Theatre and Film St, 10:15-11.45 p.m. BLM 201 Presiding Officer: Deborah J. Cohen, University of Tulsa 1. Images and Stereotypes of Argentine Women in Manuel Romero's Films: A Revisionist Perspective. Alberto Ciria, Simon Fraser Univer- sity. 20 minutes Manuel Romero (1891-1954) was one of the leading lights in Argentine commercial cinema of the 1930s and 1940s. His portrayal of women in his numerous films (and in the many tango lyrics he wrote) is in need of a serious analysis both regarding the period in which he made the films and the current 1990s. This paper will provide such an analysis from a socio-cultural perspective, with special emphasis on the collective imaginary of Argentinians, the pervasive social and political myths, and the role(s) of women in today's Argentina. 2. Jungle Love and the Death of Romance: the Modernization of Iracema. Irene Matthews, Northern Arizona University. 20 minutes Jose de Alencar's 19th century romantic version of the Birth of a Nation, Iracema, repaid the willfulness and the love of the native heroine with death. The eponymous film "version" does not actually kill off "Iracema," but shows how native girls from Brazil's heartlands continue to be susceptible to blonde foreigners and to corruption. This paper examines the modern perpetuation of one of romance's fundamental themes: the wages of passion are the death of the soul (...if you're a woman). 3. Maria Adelaide Amaral: Disaffection from Within the Ranks. Leslie Damasceno, Princeton University. 20 minutes Towards the end of the Brazilian dictatorship, when the major theatrical current stressed allegory and/or techniques of aesthetic aggression, Maria Adelaide Amaral was criticized for the psychological realism of her plays, to which she replied: "Registro o que vejo nesse ambiente." This study analyzes how the psychological realism of her two major plays, "Bodas de papel" and "De braqos abertos" gives insights into the post-Brazilian-miracle executive sector of the middle class that provide a multi-layered critique of patriarchal order. 4. Textos dialogantes: la experiencia posmoderna en Siete lunas y un espejo de Albalucia Angel. Ana Maria Rodriguez-Vivaldi, Washington State University. 20 minutes El texto de la novelista y dramaturga colombiana propone una confrontaci6n de grandes personajes femeninos hist6ricos en un Ambito ideal y encantado donde se enfrentan a su vez a la visi6n de lo masculino. El didlogo inserto en la formulaci6n hist6rica y literaria que las define, sirve para hacerlas Ilegar a una visi6n enriquecida de sus propias realidades. La indefinici6n ontol6gica posmoderna surge de esa multiplicidad real/aparencial y del juego de posibilidades entre el presente y lo hist6rico.</page><page sequence="23">170 Detailed Schedule of Events 5-2 Contemporary Italian Women Writers St, 10:15-11.45 p.m. BLM 207 Presiding Officer: Giuliana Menozzi, Miami University of Ohio 1. Renata Vigano's L'Agnese va a morire: Dissimulation and the Female Body in the Italian Resistance. Carolyn Daly, University of Southern California. 15 minutes The paper analyzes the effects of the space of the protagonist's body on her con- sciousness; on the partisans who recognize her both as a maternal figure and soldier; and on the Germans, against whom that space functions as a camouflage dissimulat- ing her identity. 2. The Double Exile: Jewish Italian Women Writers. Paola Cardi, Columbia University. 15 minutes The works of Jewish Italian women writers include accounts of their families' experiences during World War II; and accounts of female characters living a forceful "right of passage." Their state of exile is doubly painful since they are made to feel different both as Jews and as women. 3. Silence and Solidarity: Lalla Romano's Tetto Murato. Bernadette Luciano, University of California, Santa Barbara. 15 minutes Against the backdrop of a war which suspends everyday life, Tetto Murato describes the alternative life style beyond the walls that isolate and protect its protagonists. Conventional social bounds break down and a new reality emerges, defined by the dreams and silence at the core of Romano's poetics. 4. "Spoetizzare tutto": Darcia Maraini's Dialogue of a prostitute with a client. Rodica Blumenfeld, Vassar College. 15 minutes What is the argument of the "Dialogue" with its insisting pattern of bodily focus? If each focus is also a symbolic locus, there is necessarily a counterpoetics at work that confronts the construction of a Woman as in Simone de Beauvoir's "eminently poetic reality." 5-3 Comparative Literature St, 10:15-11.45 p.m. BLM 214 Presiding Officer: Magdalena Zaborowsha, Furman University Secretary: Bradley Butterfield, University of Oregon 1. The Fear of the Feminine: The Daughter's Threat to Paternalistic Authority Structures (Strindberg, Brecht, Giradoux, and Sartre). Hed- vig Fraunhofer, University of Oregon. 15 minutes. In his analysis of fascist literature, Klaus Theweleit (Male Fantasies) claims that the "fear of the feminine" forms the basis of gender relations in patriarchal society. I argue that, in the context of the emergence of the fatherless society, this "fear of the feminine" is inscribed as the daughters' threat to paternalistic authority structures.</page><page sequence="24">Detailed Schedule of Events 171 2. Fearing and Desiring 'Irrational' Women: Dantean Echoes in Thomas Mann's 'Walpurgisnacht' Episode. Ray Fleming, Penn State University. 15 minutes. In the "Walpurgisnacht" chapter of Thomas Mann's Zauberberg Mann presents the Russian woman, Clawdia Chauchat, as a sexual and moral outlaw whose values and desires are at odds with the bourgeois world of Hans Castorp, the "hero" of the novel. Clawdia's "orientalism," her exotic-erotic and irrational appeal threaten to seduce Hans from the path of virtue associated with Western rationality. In canto V of Dante's Inferno it is Francesca of Rimini whose erotic charm and discourse threaten to morally seduce Dante the wayfarer. My feminist examination of Clawdia and Francesca will reveal not only Mann's important and largely unacknowledged debt to Dante in the Zauberberg, but more importantly, it will demonstrate in canonical texts the continuity of fear of the Other as represented by woman, and how that fear arises from masculine desire. 3. Prefatory Personae in Don Quixote and Lolita. Marilyn Edelstein, Santa Clara University. 15 minutes. This paper explores the prefatory manipulations of authorial personae and of reader- ly receptionin Cervantes' Prologue to Part I of Don Quixote and Nabokov's Foreword and Afterword to Lolita. While Cervantes' Prologue is virtually a transcript of a "dialogue" between the "real" Cervantes and a fictive "friend," Nabokov's Foreword (by a fictive editor) and Afterword (in his own "voice") are in dialogue with each other. These paratexts force us to interrogate questions of authority, truth, reality, and fictionality. 4. Crossing Borders: Reading and Writing the "American" Self Across Culture and Language. Pamelyn Dane and Carol Faulkner, University of Oregon. 15 minutes. Bharati Mukherjee, Sandra Cisneros, and Grace Paley are writers deeply embedded in their own cultures: Indian, Latino, and Jewish. Yet all three attempt to create "American" selves in their works by crossing the borders between American literary and cultural expectations. As writers and readers also deeply embedded within our own cultures, we too will cross the borders between academic and cultural expectations as we attempt to suggest ways of reading and writing about these writers. 5-4 Film and Literature St, 10:15-11.45 p.m. BLM 301 Presiding Officer: Douglas Keesey, California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo Secretary: Anna Everett, UCLA 1. The Cinematic Construction of Innocence in Thin Blue Line. Renee R. Curry, California State University at San Marcos. 18 minutes My paper argues that director Errol Morris's documentary constructs Randall Adams as an innocent subject by cinematically interrogating the discursive field of</page><page sequence="25">172 Detailed Schedule of Events law that convicted him as a cop-killer. This interrogation wields a new under- standing of the so-called facts, and ultimately cinema earns Adams his freedom. 2. Pos(t)ing Modernism: The Postmodernism of The Moderns. Crystal Downing, UCLA. 18 minutes The Moderns, a film focused on 1920's modernism, gestures toward the postmoder- nism of the late 1980's when it was made. Just as the narrative center of the film is a conflict over artificial constructions-paintings which are forgeries of famous works-The Modems draws attention to the artificial posturing of its own surfaces. 3. The Masquerade of Femininity in Carson McCullers's The Ballad of the Sad Cafe. Kathleen Doty, Humboldt State University. 18 minutes My analysis of the film adaptation of The Ballad of the Sad Cafe uses feminist theory to argue that dialectical conflicts of gender reside in images of the body. By comparing key scenes, I show how the film turns McCullers's parable into a tragic masquerade of femininity. 4. Passion, Politics, and the Price of Pleasure: Renegotiating the Heterosexual Romance in Recent Commercial Filmic Art. Stephanie Hammer. University of California, Riverside. 18 minutes This paper will look at four recent films' invocation of the romance genre from the U. S. and Germany. Relying on the critical breakdown which occurs in Northrop Frye's very odd analysis of the romance mode in the Anatomy of Criticism, I will briefly map out the ways in which contemporary filmic romance tried (and often fails, as it does in Wings of Desire) to look beyond the limitations of its own formulae, toward new erotic combinations, and toward new narrative possibilities (Terminator's 1 and 2). 5-5 Critical Theory St, 10:15-11.45 p.m. BLM 305 Presiding Officer: Aldon Nielsen, San Jose State University Secretary: Eve Tavor Bannet, University of South Carolina 1. Benjamin's Kaleidoscope: The Machinery of Expression. Tyrus Miller, Stanford University. 20 minutes An exploration of the background and theoretical implications of an image adopted by Walter Benjamin in his Arcades Project: the kaleidoscope; Benjamin utilizes it as a conceptual model for rethinking the Marxist topology of base-superstructure in terms of expressive relations between cultural figures and the material conditions of production. 2. Critical Approaches to Africanist Discourse in 19th Century American Writing. Helen Anderson. 20 minutes This paper traces uses of Africanist imagery in 19th century American writings and investigates images of whiteness that result from a thematic reliance on an aesthetic of blackness. Theoretical approaches to the critique of this discursive reliance occupy the central position of the paper.</page><page sequence="26">Detailed Schedule of Events 173 3. Habeas Corpus: Deleuze, Bergson, Hitchcock. Paul Douglass, San Jose State University. 20 minutes Gilles Deleuze's contribution to film theory is part of his critique of and apologia for Bergson. In purporting to out-Bergson Bergson, he has made a true semiology of the cinema; he has also "disappeared" the subject, mocking, like Hitchcock, our attempt to locate consciousness in Descartean bodies. Deleuze describes a cinematic "image- production" that is disturbing in direct proportion to its productivity as theory. 5-6 The Immigrant Experience in English Fiction St, 10:15-11.45 p.m. BLM 306 Presiding Officer: Inder Nath Kher, University of Calgary 1. Maya Sanyal and Her Cousins: Self-Confrontation, Alienation and Identity in Bharati Mukherjee's Short Fiction. K. D. Verma, University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown. 20 minutes. The case of Maya Sanyal in the short story "Tenant" will perhaps be utterly shocking and repulsive to a moralist. This paper considers Maya Sanyal and her cousins in a broader cultural context, especially as defined by the socio-historical and psychological situation of exile, by the complex process of self-confrontation, aliena- tion and identity, and by the contemporary gender-related critical theory. 2. "Mothers, Daughters and Immigrants in Sara Suleri's Meatless Days. Anu Aneja, Ohio Wesleyan University. 20 minutes. This paper will examine the redefinitions of the notion of "immigration" as manifested in Sara Suleri's Meatless Days, and study the relationships that women and men have to the space around them. 3. German, Jew, Foreigner: The Immigrant Experience in Anita Desai's Baumgartner's Bombay. Pippa Brush, The University of Calgary. 20 minutes. This paper will discuss the multiple layers of displacement experienced by Hugo Baumgartner, a Jewish-German immigrant to India, in Anita Desai's Baumgartner's Bombay. It will examine his identity as Jew, German, and 'foreigner', how he and others construct those identities, and how he functions in relation to those constructions. 5-7 Chaucer &amp; Related Topics St, 10:15-11.45 p.m. BLM 309 Presiding Officer: Roseann Simeroth, Claremont Graduate School Secretary: Elizabeth Walsh, University of San Diego 1. The Three Course Lunch of Fragment III: Does the Summoner Eat the Wife of Bath's Words? Susan Signe Morrison, California State University, Fullerton. 15 minutes. The pilgrims of Fragment III attempt metonymically through language to ally themselves with authoritative discourse. The Wife of Bath translates her source of</page><page sequence="27">174 Detailed Schedule of Events authority, her text of the pudendum, into the three clerkly languages which constitute power. Although the Friar scolds her, his tale empowers female discourse. The authority of male practitioners of authoritative discourse is reestablished by the Summoner's Tale. 2. Playing and Games in the Knight's Tale. Rochelle L. Johnson, Claremont Graduate School. 15 minutes. Chaucer's knight begins the storytelling game of the Canterbury Tales, and includes the game elements of competition, spectacle, and chance in his tale. An examination of the tale as a play space reveals that Chaucer deconstructs medieval societal structures, thereby calling into question the "rules of life." 3. Catalogues of Violence in Sir Orfeo and the Franklin's Tale. Donna Crawford, University of California, Riverside. 15 minutes. This paper theorizes the threats faced by women in Sir Orfeo and Chaucer'sFranklin's Tale, with particular attention to the rhetorical strategies of accommodating violence. Its central concern is with questioning the cultural work performed in fourteenth- century England by the Middle English Breton lai, which claims origins for itself in the ancient past. 4. Hagiographic Allusions in Chaucer's Shipman's Tale. Steven Grossvogel, The University of Georgia. 15 minutes. Chaucer's Shipman's Tale contains several allusions to medieval saints whose lives are parodically imitated by the characters in the tale. By comparing the saint's life to the behavior of the characters in the tale, one can see how Chaucer used these hagiographic allusions for comic effect and as part of a general moral statement. 5-8 American Literature St, 10:15-11.45 p.m. BLM 312 Presiding Officer: Susan Danielson, Portland State University Secretary: Sondra Reid, University of California, Davis 1. Flesh and Resistance in Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Larsen's Quicksand, and Morrison's The Bluest Eye. Marilyn Maness Mehaffy, University of California, Riverside. 15 minutes Conventional critical approaches have critiqued the work of African-American women writers in terms of other written texts--abolitionist, feminist, juridical, medical, literary. My presentation will look at visual narratives (both in the "fine" arts and the popular) of the African-American female body from the 1840's to the 1920's, and will suggest some textual strategies by which Jacobs, Larsen, and Mor- rison negotiate the hegemony of these picturings. 2. Texts and Voices in Cooper's The Pioneers. John Engell, San Jose Stae University. 15 minutes Contrasts the text-centered noesis of Templeton with the ear-centered noesis of Natty Bumppo and Chingachgook. Suggests that different ways to knowledge of law,</page><page sequence="28">Detailed Schedule of Events 175 culture, and history create irreconcilable conflicts between literate and oral peoples in the novel. 3. Shifting Strategies: The Triangularization of Desire in John Updike's Rabbit Redux. Joy Lynch, University of California, Davis. 15 minutes Against a backdrop of social factionalism, Updike explores the tensions of internal dissention. I argue that Rabbit's desire to recover a male bond is submerged within both psyche and narrative, placing pressure on the linguistic space allowed the femlae characters, who circulate as extra-linguistic and metaphoric conduits for a larger series of male connections. 4. Cynthia Ozick's The Messiah of Stockholm: A Holocaust Memorial. Jill Goodman, Santa Clara University. 15 minutes A postive memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe is Cynthia Ozick's 1987 novel, The Messiah of Stockholm. Here she not only recreates Schulz's lost manuscript, The Messiah, but also brings Bruno Schulz back to life by evoking his style in her text, by retelling his history, by offering criticism on his works, and by giving him characters who claim to be his children, who remember and mourn for him. 12:00 - 2:00 p.m. LUNCHEON BANQUET Faculty Club Presidential Address: Konigsburg: Some Unusual Solonibre in Berlin, 1780-1848 Roswitha Burwick, Scripps College SATURDAY 2:15 - 3:45 p.m. SESSION 6 (1-8) Balmer Hall 6-1 Spanish and Portuguese (Peninsular) St, 2:15-3:45 p.m. BLM 201 Presiding Officer: Cecile West-Settle, Washington and Lee University Secretary: Jean S. Chittenden, Trinity University 1. La '(iltima' celda en la poesia de M. Hernandez. Jos6 Maria Nahar- ro-Calder6n, University of Maryland at College Park. 15 minutes La poesia de Miguel Hernandez perteneciente al periodo de su prisi6n se ha visto como expresi6n de una trascendencia mi(s)tica que ha l1evado a la critica a dar .nfasis a sus aspectos "heroicos." Frente a esta visi6n de circunstancias, tambi6n habria que destacar los rasgos espacialmente carcelarios de los poemas para rescatarlos de la celda critica que han postulado estas lecturas mitificantes. 2. Metonymy, Repetition and the Renewal of Language in Claudio Rodriguez's Don de la Ebriedad. Michael Mudrovic, Washington University. 15 minutes Several poems of Claudio Rodriguez's Don de la ebriedad are based upon juxtaposition and repetition. This metonymic approach allows the poet to expand the possibilities of language, but also calls into question poetic inspiration and the identity of the poet who attempts to define himself through writing.</page><page sequence="29">176 Detailed Schedule of Events 3. God and Nature in the Poetry of Gloria Fuertes. Sylvia Sherno, UCLA. 15 minutes Gloria Fuertes's poetry elaborates a view of the divinity that diverges from tradition- al logocentrism. Instead, she finds spirituality and a profound moral sense within herself and within the natural environment. 4. Writing and Seeing Anew: Poems by Maria del Carmen Pallards. Anita Hart, University of North Carolina at Charlotte. 15 minutes. Poet and artist Maria del Carmen Pallarss, born in Madrid in 1950, published six individual collections of poetry from 1979 to 1989, as well as an anthology. Although her works have been acknowledged by critics and anthologists, no one has written analytical studies of her poetry. This paper examines selected poems by Pallarss to see how her work shows new ways of knowing and being. As I consider how the poet is engaged in a process of seeing and transforming her reality, I will incorporate Adrienne Rich's observation that "... poems are like dreams: in them you put what you don't know you know." 6-2 Resisting, Transgressing, Subverting the Boundaries and Limits of Gender, Class, and Race St, 2:15-3:45 p.m. BLM 207 Presiding Officer: Randall Moon, University of California, Riverside Secretary: Linda Joan Krumholz, Denison University. 1. Georg Forster, Immanuel Kant and Christoph Meiners on the Cog- nitive Category of 'Race': Coming to Grips with the Empirical Data of Travel Reports. Thomas Strack, University of Southern California. 20 minutes. I investigate Forster's approach to the category of "race" and show how it became an important issue in late 18th century philosophical studies of cultural diversity. Analyzing how this concept fit in with philosophical anthropology reveals the development of strategies of representing cultural diversity and the formation of a discourse within which the promotion, resistance, and subversion of established notions of "race" were to take place. 2. Puzzling Margins: Materialism and Materiality in Housekeeping, Tar Baby, and Love Medicine. Patricia Hunt, CUNY Graduate School. 20 minutes. These novels, published in the 1980s, share an interrogation of the materialism which was to become particularly defining of the decade. Shunning this materialism, and employing an alternative hermeneutic of faith, Robinson, Erdrich, and Morrison reject the notion that boundaries are absolute. From different cultural loci, these works convey loss and longing for reconnection with a departed other. 3. Metamorphosing Genders: Djuna Barnes' Nightwood. Yvonne C. Reineke, University of Canterbury, New Zealand. 20 minutes.</page><page sequence="30">Detailed Schedule of Events 177 Nightwood explores the ways in which signifying systems are intimately tied to representations of the body. I examine the novel's reformations of bodily repre- sentations in terms of the fixed positioning of bodies and subjectivities in patriarchal discourse. Barnes struggles with the question of whether momentary subversion only reaffirms the system of patriarchy. 6-3 Gender and the German Lyric St, 2:15-3:45 p.m. BLM 214 Presiding Officer: Katherine E. Ayer, University of Southern California 1. 'Ob sie der man ym hau3g sein wolt': Gender, Sex and Genre in the Poetry of Hans Folz. Aaron E. Wright, University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. 20 minutes. In two songs 'in der flam weyB' the Nuremberg poet Hans Folz (ca. 1435-1512/13) claims to reconcile competing stereotypes of misogyny and adoration. In fact, however, the first song's image of the virago, derived from motifs native to maere and fastnachspil, is only affirmed in the second, which defends not woman, but marriage as a device for the control of female wickedness. 2. '...ich wandte mich hoflich an den Mann und schrieb in seinem Beysein schnell ein Versbriefchen': Poetry in Letters of German Women in the Eighteenth Century. Lorely French, Pacific University. 20 minutes. Drawing on specific examples of poetry in personal letters of women in the latter half of the eighteenth century, this paper shows how women couple the lyrical with the epistolary form to foster dialogue in their intellectual community while establish- ing their independence. By integrating poems into letters, women discuss the writing and publishing processes, thereby challenging boundaries of the private and public spheres. 3. Ambiguities of Gender in Ingeborg Bachmann's Love Poetry. Daniel Rhodes, University of California, Irvine. 20 minutes. This paper will examine manipulations of gender in Ingeborg Bachmann's love poetry. The "Ich" is often, although not exclusively, identified as male. These are not poems of fulfillment. As expressions of gender identities and conflicts, they are also an awakening to the possibility of reconciliation. They may be also be seen as a part of Bachmann's exploration of utopia. 6-4 Shakespeare and Related Topics St, 2:15-3:45 p.m. BLM 301 Presiding Officer: Evelyn Gajowski, University of Nevada, Las Vegas Secretary: Kay Stanton, California State University, Fullerton 1. 'The mirror of all Christian kings': Henry V and the Politics of Sight. Jeanie Grant Moore, University of California, Riverside. 20 minutes</page><page sequence="31">178 Detailed Schedule of Events Legendary magic mirrors seen through by kings and the "mirror of drama" as it re-presents Henry 5, "the mirror of all Christian kings," serve more than a mimetic function; rather, they cast multiple fragmented reflections upon the figure of Henry, the constructive and deconstructive possibilities of theatricality, and the problems of history and representation. 2. Curses! The Spoken Word and the Unruly Woman in Shakespeare's Henry VI Plays. Kathleen Patterson, University of California, River- side. 20 minutes Whereas Phyllis Rackin argues that the feminine is associated with "deeds" as opposed to masculine "words" in the Henry 6 plays, I argue that the unruly feminine, patriarchal subverter, is most closely associated with the spoken word; thus, the true dichotomy is between masculine historiography and disruptive feminine speak- ing/cursing/prophesying/ seducing. 3. Loving Palms and Demon Brothers: Conflicting Marriage Models in The Duchess ofMalfi. David Phillips, University of Nevada, Las Vegas. 20 minutes In the early seventeenth-century the Anglican marriage model based on obedience and procreation conflicted with a newly emerging Puritan model which stressed greater freedom of selection and mutual love. I locate the two models in Webster's characters to argue that he supports the Puritan view. 4. Hamlet's Whores. Kay Stanton, California State University, Fuller- ton. 20 minutes Hamlet contests patriarchal assumptions about male superiority and female whorish- ness: "Get thee to a nunnery." Male characters pander themselves and others besides being used as whores; if Gertrude and Ophelia become whores by men's exploitation of them, neither becomes a bawd to others. 6-5 Linguistics St, 2:15-3:45 p.m. BLM 305 Presiding Officer: Roslyn Raney, College of San Mateo Secretary: Gayle Henrotte, University of La Verne 1. Asymmetry in the Use of much/viel and many/viele in English and German. Mary Michele Wauchope, San Diego State University. 15 minutes. Quantifying adjectives much and many in English and viel and viele in German modify, respectively, mass and countable nouns. However, in both languages, one adjective is frequently replaced by the other member of the pair. Historical data indicate that [+ mass] and [+ countable] are not distinct semantic/functional categories for Germanic quantifiers. 2. The Positional Fields Model of Word Order in Dutch and German. Thomas F. Shannon, University of California, Berkeley. 15 minutes.</page><page sequence="32">Detailed Schedule of Events 179 Studies of word order in Dutch and German often invoke the sentence frame, a set of fixed points occupied by verbal elements. Other constituents occupy positional fields whose boundaries are defined by the sentence frame. Various definitions of the fields and certain differences between Dutch and German word order will be discussed. 3. On the Interpretation of Historical Tenses. Cornelia Paraskevas, Western Oregon State College. 15 minutes. Appropriate temporal interpretation of "shifted" tenses, e.g., the Historical Present, depends not on morphological form but on discourse context. Data from Modern Greek oral and written narratives will be examined to determine how explicit and implicit discourse markers serve as anchoring points and allow interpretation of "shifted" tenses. 4. The Past Marker in Palenquero. Martha Swearingen, Stanford University. 15 minutes. The use of the clitic -ba as a past marker in Palenquero, a Spanish creole, differs considerably from the Spanish suffix -ba. Its existence in Palenquero has been noted, but not discussed in detail. Its attachment to verbal and non-verbal constituents and its significance within the tense/aspect system are examined in this paper. 5. Chinook Jargon: Arguments for a Pre-Contact Origin. Barbara P. Harris, University of Victoria. 15 minutes. The origin of Chinook Jargon is a question that creolists have debated for some time. Research presented here adduces linguistic, historical, sociological, and anthropological evidence, as well as anecdotal data from native Pacific Northwest families, in support of the pre-contact trade language hypothesis. 6-6 National Literatures: Italy in a European Context St, 2:15-3:45 p.m. BLM 306 Presiding Officer: Margaret Brose, University of California, Santa Cruz 1. The Moor of Venice, or the Italian on the English Renaissance Stage. Margo Hendricks, University of California, Santa Cruz. 20 minutes. This paper considers early modern English stage representations of Italy. I begin with a brief analysis of "race" and "nation," and then discuss Italian stereotypes in plays such as William Shakespeare's Othello and John Webster's The White Devil. 2. Baroque Polyvocality: Pietro della Valle and the De-nationalizing of Italian. Zakiya Hanafi, University of Washington. 20 minutes. On his return from his arduous journey through the Eastern Empire, Roman aris- tocrat Pietro della Valle (1586-1652) was welcomed by his letterati friends with a funeral for his young Persian bride. My paper erects another catafalque around this baroque occasion by examining the multi-lingual verses composed for the bride by Italian Humanists.</page><page sequence="33">180 Detailed Schedule of Events 3. The 'Colonial Novel' Reconsidered: Colonialism or Cultural Peda- gogy. Pasquale Verdicchio, University of California, San Diego. 20 minutes. This paper presents a brief history of the so-called colonial novel, and its function under Fascism, followed by a consideration of possible evolutions in the genre. I examine the works of Italian "pieds noirs" authors such as Erminia Dell'Oro (Asmara Addio) and Alfredo Antonaros (Tornare a Carobel). 6-7 Medieval Literature St, 2:15-3:45 p.m. BLM 309 Presiding Officer: William E. Burgwinkle, University of Hawaii at Manoa 1. Sex Therapy as a Cure for Love: The Ending of the Romance of the Rose. Peter Allen, Pomona College. 20 minutes This paper proposes a new reading of the Romance of the Rose in light of medieval theories of lovesickness. The author surveys classical Greek and Arabic medical treatises dealing with this illness, considering both their difference from Christian theology and their intersection with literary practice. The overlapping of literary and medical theory that he finds in classical literature can also be found in medieval literature, specifically in the Romance of the Rose, and can offer a new explanation for the romance's sudden ending. 2. White Martyrdom and the Red Cat: William IX's 'Farai un vers, pos mi sonelh' and Religious Asceticism. Marc Wolterbeek, College of Notre Dame. 20 minutes This paper examines charges leveled against Robert of Arbrissel, the founder of Fontevray Abbey, that he practiced white martyrdom (a holy man sleeping with a woman) as a form of penance. Through a study of two contemporary vitae and the poetry of William IX, the author questions whether there can be any substance to the charges and to what extent William's song can be seen as a parody of Robert's mission. He concludes that linear historical contingencies between literature and reality cannot be established and that William's song is quite simply a work of fiction which emphasizes the literal. 3. 'Sic mea fata' and 'Dum ludis floribus': The Lyrical Mutation of a Convergent Culture. Julie Chappell, Saint Mary's College of Califor- nia. 15-20 minutes The Carmina Burana and Harley 2253 manuscripts constitute a cultural and linguistic map of the evolution of the vernacular in European literature. Through an examina- tion of the medieval Latin, English and French pieces that they contain, the author examines how these three languages converge in macaronic verse and parallel the cultural 'identity crisis' of the later Middle Ages. 4. Writing the Present, Writing the 'Real': Reflections on Historical Representations in Froissart's Book I of Les Chroniques. Danielle Nicole Egan, University of Southern California.</page><page sequence="34">Detailed Schedule of Events 181 6-8 Violence in the Literature of the American South St, 2:15-3:45 p.m. BLM 312 Presiding Officer: David L. Arnold, University of California, Riverside 1. When Violence is Not Violence: The Aesthetics of Grotesque Myth in Old Southwest Humor. Kim Johnson-Bogart, University of Washington. 15 minutes Critics characterize Old Southwest humor as violent As participants and critics of American society, the humorists depicted violent realities in their tall tales. But as a mythic world organized by grotesque laughter, Old Southwest humor's violence often positively symbolizes the cycle of destruction and creation central to American genesis. 2. Violence in Southern Literature: 'Violence Begets Violence' in the Works of Toni Morrison. Regenia Woodberry, University of Central Oklahoma. 15 minutes Toni Morrison's depictions of the South resound with the cycles of violence within the African-American community. By examining the racial and gender bases for this violence I seek to determine whether its function is destructive or redemptive, and to define the paradigmatic function of violence in Southern culture. 3. 'Hunt It Down and Kill It': Violence and the Uncanny in Wise Blood. Jeff Gray, University of California, Riverside. 16 minutes In an effort to escape Flannery O'Connor's own anagogical readings of the Southern "grotesque," we may turn to Freud's essay on "The Uncanny" for an explanation of the strangeness of the violence in Wise Blood, a novel in which the autonomy of the body / even of body parts / disturbs both characters and readers. 4. As I Lay Decomposing: The Effluence of the Subject in Faulkner's As I Lay Dying. Jeffrey Poggi, Lafayette College. 16 minutes As Addie Bundren's physical body rots she grows into a centrality as composing subject unavailable to her while alive. Her life with Anse is defined in terms of absence and codified by textual blank spaces, but as the speaking/composing center of the novel deteriorates, Addie coalesces and becomes the center. 4:14 - 5:45 p.m. PLENARY SESSION AND BUSINESS MEETING Kane 210 Germany-A Literary Concept: The Myth of National Literature Hinrich Seeba, University of California, Berkeley 6:00 - 8:00 p.m. Hispanist's Reception Faculty Club 6:00 - 8:00 p. m.

Dickens' Lady Wrestlers: Ethics and the Rhetoric of Revolution. Michael J. Walker, University of Cincinnati-Raymond Walters College. 15 minutes. The battle between Miss Pross and Madame Defarge over Lucy Manette in A Tale of Two Cities reveals the sex/class conflict which Dickens presented as a moral struggle in his version of the French Revolution. Dickens' moral rhetoric allowed his Vic- torian and later audiences to approve of violence while remaining "civilized." 2. The Book of Nature Refigured: Toward a Rhetoric of Biology. W. John Coletta, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. 15 minutes. Nature itself is irreducibly figurative. Given this premise, I will read a "page" from this post-modern "book of nature" and describe a poet's and a scientist's attempts to participate in this biological world through metaphor. A biological catachresis and a Peircean "[meta]index" are compared with respect to survival value. 3. Abstractions of Beasts: The Representation of Animal Minds in Children's Realistic Animal Fiction. Lori Jo Oswald, University of Oregon. 15 minutes. Writers of children's animal fiction have their own biases concerning animal thought, feelings, instinct, and human/animal communication. The genre purports to portray animals behaving naturally. I will focus on how authors define realistic animals, and what assumptions about animal sentience authors display through such definitions. 4. Quintilian Forensics and the Rhetoric of 'A Faithful Narrative' in Pride and Prejudice. Robert Einarsson, North American Baptist College. 15 minutes. The comic resolution in Pride and Prejudice can begin only after Darcy's letter of self-vindication has been unfolded. The letter, containing his narrative version of the events, mirrors Quintilian's instruction on outline and proofs in the forensic oration (Institutio). The real test of Quintilian's methods would be to reduce the negative character judgement that the novel finally levels against Wickham. 7-3 Romanticism Sn, 8:30-10:00 a.m. BLM 301 Presiding Officer: Atara Stein, California State University, Fullerton Secretary: Victoria Myers, Pepperdine University</page><page sequence="36">Detailed Schedule of Events 183 1. Shelley, Christ, and the Wandering Jew. Teddi Chichester, UCLA. 15 minutes When the adolescent Shelley attacked the Christian religion, he inevitably assaulted his own ideal of selflessness: Jesus. Seizing Ahasuerus as his paradigm for the self-involved betrayer, Shelley began developing Christ and the Wandering Jew as competing personae who would allow him both to indulge and combat self-idolatry. 2. Envisioning Lastness: Byron's 'Darkness,' Campbell's 'The Last Man,'and the Critical Aftermath. Morton D. Paley, University of California, Berkeley. 15 minutes Perhaps because of anxieties generated after the French Revolution, criticism in the Romantic period perceived as a threat the idea of the Last Man. An examination of reviews and lampoons will show how coping strategies-including analogy, categorization, and trivialization-were developed to protect readers from envision- ing Lastness. 3. Talking to Myself: The Wordsworthean Sublime within the Descrip- tive Meditative Lyric. Jo-Anne Cappeluti, California State University, Fullerton. 15 minutes Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey" is a clear example of what M. H. Abrams has defined as the descriptive meditative lyric, with its "dramatic mode of intimate talk to an unanswering auditor." This argument delineates what is new about the Romantic way of apprehending and problematizing the sublime in this lyric form. 4. Beautifying the Sublime: Tracing the Aesthetic Development of Subjectivity in Burke and Wordsworth. Bill Musgrave, University of California, Berkeley. 15 minutes This paper argues that the narrative of beautification underlying Burke's "natural- ized" account of the constitution of self and society finds strategic re-visioning in The Prelude, Book V, where it culminates in the "self-interpellation" of the Winander Boy within an "ideology of the beautiful" that tenuously re-submits subjective autonomy to nature. 7-4 Modernism-Is That All There Was? Reassessing Literature of the Transition, 1900-1914. Sn, 8:30-10:00 a.m. BLM 305 Presiding Officers: Anne B. Simpson and Carola M. Kaplan, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona 1. Aesthetic Practices as a Function of a Gendered Epistemology: Reassessing the Nomenclature of Modernism. Ann ter Haar, Univer- sity of California, Davis. 20 minutes. Correspondences in the life-plots and/or early works of Woolf, Mansfield, Rhys, and H. D. during the years 1906-1912 demonstrate the significance of the accessibility of a heretofore inaccessible nomadic life-plot. This paper evaluates the nascent aes-</page><page sequence="37">184 Detailed Schedule of Events thetic practices of this group on the basis of a gendered epistemology, and as distinct from that cultural monolith, Modernism. 2. Old Irish Myth in Yeats's On Baile's Strand. Caitriona Moloney, University of California, Davis. 20 minutes. A glance at Bram Dijkstra's Idols of Perversity confirms the centrality of the femme fatale in Modernism. But for Yeats there was more: he mined Irish literature for his heroines, especially in the Cuchulain cycle plays. In On Baile's Strand, Yeats's radical revision of ancient Irish legend reveals his ambivalence about powerful women: he admires them but portrays them as fatal. This paper explores the nature of Yeats's attraction to, and repulsion from, the power of women in ancient Irish myth. 3. Gertrude Stein: Outlaw or Classic? Nancy Gray, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. 20 minutes. Modernism, while distinctive, was both new and not. Gertrude Stein, usually thought of as a quintessential modernist, could tell stories both new and not. Her first published fiction, Three Lives (1909), has a strong intertextual relation to Flaubert's Trois Contes yet is wholly its own creation. Like modernism, it is both old and new at once. 7-5 Indo-European Language and Culture Sn, 8:30-10:00 a.m. BLM 306 Presiding Officer: Carol F. Justus, San Jose State University 1. The Meaning and Use of Indo-European *dheH- 'put, place; make'. George Giannakis, UCLA. 15 minutes The root *dheH, is widely attested in Indo-European both in its basic meaning 'put, place' (Greek tfftheemi, Sanskrit dadhami) and the derived meaning 'make'. (Latin fa-c-io, cf. Greek &amp;-the-k-a, perfect of 'put'). Collocations with 'name' in the sense 'to fashion a name, to name someone' in Greek 6noma tfthesthai, Hittite laman dai-, Sanskrit nama dha-, Lat nomen facio suggest that it is perhaps a part of the IE poetic formula *(H)nomn dheH. This study contributes to work on the mytho-poetic lan- guage of the IE peoples. 2. The Terminology for Anger in Selected Indo-European Languages. Thomas R. Walsh, Occidental College 15 minutes Terminology for anger and related emotions is a problem for historical semantics. Among both concrete and abstract terms on the synchronic level, any one might drift in the other direction diachronically (Buck 1949:16.42). In Indo-European words for anger were associated with processes such as swelling or boiling as opposed to others associated with processes that can be termed 'mental'. Semantic distinctions in archaic Greek culture between words like ifn 'force' and ufi)is 'counsel, plan'(cf. uhfivis 'wrath') are also reflected in the vocabulary of anger in Celtic, Germanic, Italic, and Anatolian languages. This study examines the semantic shifts. 3. Greek and Pre-Greek Oath and Ritual: The Importance of Styx. Marianina Olcott, San Jose State University. 15 minutes</page><page sequence="38">Detailed Schedule of Events 185 The poets, Homer and Hesiod, and the historian, Herodotus, preserve traditions concerning oaths and oath rituals associated with the river Styx, whose source was traditionally located high in the mountains of Arcadia. The beliefs and rituals of the local Arcadians as preserved by Pausanias confirm and enlarge upon the traditions in the poets. This paper links the archaeology of Neolithic cult and belief at sites on Malta, Crete, and elsewhere in the Mediterranean with the data from the texts, data that quite likely represents a pre-Indo-European layer of culture in the Mediterranean. 4. 'Old Eire and Ancient Ways': Social Implications of Irish Myth. Christopher D. Rigby, Brandeis University. 15 minutes Cumulative models for Celtic origins are discussed in relation to the interpretation of early Irish myth. In particular, the Labor Gabala is analyzed from both functionalist and structuralist perspectives, and an ethnographic analogy is offered. Finally, the early forms of Irish kingship, as manifested in "Wooing of Etain", are examined. 5. Sounding the Gilp: The Generic Structure of Agonistic Boasting in English. Leslie K. Arnovick, University of British Columbia. 15 minutes This study has examined work on "sounding" in Old English poetry and in African- American street talk as examples of a larger oral genre, the agonistic boast. Based on a formal comparison of discourse structure and content, it demonstrates similarities that obtain despite different contexts. This paper will close with some sociolinguistic observations about the cultural factors which might motivate the two reflexes of the one speech act. 7-6 Transcending Culture: Emerson &amp; Women's Fiction Sn, 8:30-10:00 a.m. BLM 309 Presiding Officers: Angela M. Estes and Kathleen M. Lant, California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo 1. Transcending Race and Sex: Alcott's Rebellious Mulatta. Sarah Elbert, SUNY Binghamton. 15 minutes. An intertextual exploration of Louisa May Alcott's story "An Hour" and Harlem Renaissance writer Nella Larsen's novel Passing. 2. Configurations of Transcendentalism. Susan Danielson, Portland State University. 15 minutes. Analyzing Mary Gove Nichols's 1854 fictional autobiography, Mary Lyndon, I tease out the parameters of the antebellum debate between Individualism and Com- munism, and examine the critiques by women writers like Gove Nichols and Mar- garet Fuller and their proposed alternative for women and men committed to leading "truth-filled" lives. 3. The Limber Margin of the Sea: Cultural Boundaries and Transcen- dentalism. Jim Pearce, San Jose State University. 15 minutes. The American Transcendental movement initiated a cultural debate that tended to simultaneously subvert and transcend "the traditions of understanding" that con-</page><page sequence="39">186 Detailed Schedule of Events stituted the cultural boundaries of nineteenth-century America. I will examine the way in which American writers, including Melville, Dickinson, and Winters, responded to Emerson's bold plunge into the unknown. 4. The American Scholar as Paradigm for the Woman Writer in Dorothy Richardson's Pilgrimage. Christine Thompson, Portland State Univer- sity. 15 minutes. Dorothy Richardson, in her modernist novel Pilgrimage, transposes Emerson's essay "The American Scholar" from the masculine and the American into the feminine, and applies the substance of his arguments to her heroine's aspirations as a writer. SUNDAY, 10:15 - 11: 45 a.m. SESSION 8 (1-7) Balmer Hall 8-1 Gay and Lesbian Issues in Literary Studies: Subverting Lesbian Inversion Sn, 10:15-11: 45 a.m. BLM 207 Presiding Officer: Frann Michel, Willamette University 1. 'Only a Woman?': New Women and Their Romantic Friends. Kate McCullough, Miami University of Ohio. 20 minutes Florence Converse's Diana Victrix (1897) offers a representation of female-female desire which implies a twentieth-century notion of erotic desire, but without the accompanying early twentieth-century pathologized tag of "inversion." 2. Encoding Bi-locations: Sylvia Townsend Warner and the Displace- ment of a Lesbian Erotic. Jane Garrity, University of California, Berkeley. 20 minutes This paper situates Sylvia Townsend Warner's first novel, Lolly Willowes (1926) within the context of both modernist experimentation and lesbian literary theory in order to discuss the text's undisclosed, yet central, homoerotic focus. Warner utilizes the figure of the spinster, along with suggestive, allusive language, to signal her protagonist's homosexuality and encode a lesbian thematic. 3. The Inverted World of Mrs. Dalloway. Eileen Barrett, California State University, Hayward. 20 minutes Woolf's depiction of lesbians in Mrs. Dalloway reflects her critical response to the distorted representations of lesbians in the work of Havelock Ellis and other turn- of-the century sexologists. 8-2 19th-Century Interdisciplinary Studies Sn, 10:15-11: 45 a.m. BLM 214 Presiding Officer: Patricia Hunt, CUNY Graduate School Secretary: Jeffrey Groves, Harvey Mudd College</page><page sequence="40">Detailed Schedule of Events 187 1. The Last of the Pequots: William Apess and Radical Assimilation. Randall Moon, University of California, Riverside. 20 minutes. The little-known nineteenth-century Native American preacher Apess problematizes the notions of "authenticity" and "native voice" by demonstrating the porousness of racial boundaries. As he moves adroitly between two worlds, he shows how the state constitutes race for purposes of repression and the appropria- tion of property. 2. Tennyson's Reclamation of the 'Orient'. John McBratney, John Car- roll University. 20 minutes. Throughout his career Tennyson envisioned the "'Orient" as a site of loss that required reclamation through an English poetics. From his youthful adaptations of Sir William Jones to his aged prophecies in "Akbar's Dream," Tennyson participated in the Victorian effort, at once philological and imperial, to revive and thereby appropriate a moribund East. 3. 'Strange Difference of Sex': Gynecology and Destiny in Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure. Laura Morgan Green, University of Califor- nia, Berkeley. 20 minutes. Focusing on Sue Bridehead in Hardy's 1896 novel, I argue that the "New Woman" heroine is shaped by a late-Victorian gynecological discourse that anathematized the sexually and intellectually emancipated woman. This discourse operates in tension with the novel's polemic against legal and social constraints, a tension that continues to haunt constructions of femininity. 8-3 English Literature Before 1700 Sn, 10:15-11: 45 a.m. BLM 301 Presiding Officer: Janice Patten, San Jose State University Secretary: Cindy Baer, University of Washington 1. The Middle English Canon. Peter Schroeder, California State Univer- sity, San Bernardino. 18 minutes In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Chaucer, Lydgate, and Gower were recog- nized as the first real "canon" of English literature. Today Chaucer remains, but Langland and the Gawain poet have supplanted Lydgate and Cower. Why? And what do these changes suggest about the processes of canon-formation generally? 2. True Women Falsely Accused in Shakespeare. Evelyn Gajowski, University of Nevada, Las Vegas. 18 minutes Four generically dissimilar Shakespearean plays--Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, Cymbeline, and The Winter's Tale-depict trials of women falsely accused of adultery. This paper, drawing upon recent research in cultural studies and psychoanalytic theory, interrogates these false assumptions and shows that her-story of female innocence displaces his-story of female guilt. 3. Pathos and Didacticism in the Final Books of Paradise Lost. David Mikics, University of Houston. 18 minutes</page><page sequence="41">188 Detailed Schedule of Events This paper argues against Stanley Fish as representative of the critical line that prizes Milton's didactic efficiency above his testing of this didacticism. Critics such as Fish attribute to Milton a too certain optimism about the hope of didactic success and miss the double-edged character of Milton's reflection on didacticism in the later books. 8-4 Italian Sn, 10:15-11:45 a.m. BLM 305 Presiding Officer: Marga Cottino-Jones, UCLA Secretary: Maria O. Marotti, University of California, Santa Barbara 1. "Nastagio degli Onesti (Decameron, V,8) and the concept of the double." Barbara Pinna, UCLA. 15 minutes This paper offers a close reading of Decameron, V, 8 in freudian terms to explore the concept of the double and its application in the main characters and in the language of the novella. 2. "I1 viaggiatore impossibile: il viaggio come cornice nella Genealogia deorum Gentilium di Giovanni Boccaccio." Luisella Bovio Arnold, UCLA. 15 minutes By analyzing the fifteen "prohemia" of the Genealogia deorum Gentilium, this paper will argue that a fresh narrative attitude together with an unquenched curiosity for distant places is present even in this last 'scholarly' task of Boccaccio. 3. "The Epistolary Legacy of Alessandra Macinghi Strozzi. Mia Cocco, University of Georgia. 15 minutes Alessandra Macinghi Strozzi's "epistolario" is extremely important to family writ- ings and history, mercantile literature, and the culture and language of Quattrocento Italy. This paper evaluates its importance a dose analysis of its main linguistic and literary elements. 4. "Feeding the Cultural Body: Placental Myth in Stefano D'Arrigo's Cima delle nobildonne. Deanna Shemek, University of California, Santa Cruz. 15 minutes This paper discusses Stefano D'Arrigo's 1985 novel, Cima delle nobildonne, in terms of its treatment of gender as a product of both technology and myth, and places the novel's concerns among an array of problems explored by postmodern literature. 8-5 Contemporary German Literature and Culture Sn, 10:15-11: 45 a.m. BLM 306 Presiding Officer: Andrea Gogroef-Voorhees, University of Washington 1. From Bonn to Berlin: The Topos of the Capital. Philip Carroll, University of Oregon. 10 minutes</page><page sequence="42">Detailed Schedule of Events 189 Before the 18th century gave us a concept of culture, "culture" was represented by the arsenal of rhetorical commonplaces. This paper examines how "Die Zeit" has presented the debate over the site over Germany's capital; it argues that the topographical representation of culture is alive and well. 2. Loss, Betrayal, Racism: Taking Account Three Years After German Reunification. Irmgard Elsner Hunt, Colorado State University. 15 minutes Giienter Grass, the aging (West-)German who loved his country, Chaim Noll, the young (East-)German Jew who did not, and Urs Jaeggi, the Swiss outsider: three perspectives on the state of affairs in Germany today which the authors perceive as vastly dominated by fear and hatred. 3. Das Zufillige ist das Wahre. Karin Bauer, Michigan State University. 15 minutes Diese Arbeit untersucht Herta Miillers Poetik des Randes in Reisende auf einem Bein anhand der zergliedernden Wahrnehmungsoptik und des widerstandigen Blickes der Aussenseiterin, deren Schreiben als "Arbeit an der TAuschung" unter dem wachsamen "Auge der Macht" Widerstand gegen die Enteignung der Wirklichkeit und die Zwange falscher IdentitAten anmeldet. 4. "so echt wie im wirklichen leben. fast noch echter." Wirklichkeitsperzeption und Rezeption von "Wirklichem" in Elfriede Jelineks Michael. Ein Jugendbuch fir die Infantilgesellschaft. Imke Meyer, University of Illinois. 15 minutes Meine Arbeit fragt, auf welche Weise den Figuren in Elfriede Jelineks Michael eine "wirkliche" Wahrnehmung von Wirklichkeit durch ihr Ausgeliefertsein und ihr Sich-Ausliefern an eine von Massenmedien dominierte Gesellschaft schon immer unm6glich gemacht worden ist. Der Begriff "Wirklichkeit" wird vom Text in den Raum des Unwirklichen gertickt. 8-6 The Times They Are A'Changin'?: Absence of Women &amp; Minorities in the College Curriculum Sn, 10:15-11:45 a.m. BLM 309 Presiding Officer: Wayne Templeton, University of British Columbia 1. Feminist Revisions to Research Methodology in Humanities. Diane Watson, The University of British Columbia. 25 minutes This paper will survey the methodological principles and practices (which also necessarily embrace epistemological concerns) that some feminist teachers would like to see developed within the context of university/college courses, but which are absent from the curriculum because they pose a deep threat to traditional methodol- ogy. 2. Homer, Woolf, and Silko: Juxtaposing Discourses of Privilege and Discourses of Marginility in the Great Books Curriculum. Laurie J. Churchill, Ohio Wesleyan University. 25 minutes</page><page sequence="43">190 Detailed Schedule of Events This paper discusses how in teaching Homer's Odyssey with Woolf's To the Lighthouse and Silko's Ceremony I explore literary representations of love and sexuality via the lenses or racial, class, and gender differences, thus creating an associative model for exploring new directions in literary interpretation. 8-7 Folklore and Mythology Sn,10:15-11:45 a.m. BLM 312 Presiding Officer: Caitriona Moloney, University of California, Davis Secretary: Michelle Scalise Sugiyama, University of California, Santa Barbara 1. Notes on Goddess Religions of the Early British Isles. Frank Bat- taglia, College of Staten Island. 20 minutes This paper presents a survey of relevant evidence which is rarely summarized: the Grimes Graves, East Anglia flint mine goddess shrine, art and iconography of Breton Neolithic tombs, anthropomorphic figurines suggestive of sexual aspects of fertility religion, as well as literary figures from Anglo-Saxon, Latin and Irish sources, suggest a cult of the "mothers" or encounters with supernatural women 2. Goddess of River, Goddess of the Foam. Miriam Robbins Dexter, University of Southern California. 20 minutes Once,in the Golden Age, there was a goddess of love and beauty who was born from the foam of the sea. In Greece, she was known as Aphrodite; in India, she was Shri Lakshmi. This paper traces the common origins of these Greek and Indic myths, relating them to Near Eastern Kingship-in-Heaven myths; the Babylonian myth of Amakandu, son of Earth; the Hittite myth of Kumarbi and Anu; the Phoenician myth preserved in Eusebius' "Praeparatio Evangelica"; and the Ugaritic myth of El and Anat. 3. The Man Who Dreamed of Death's Space. John Beckman. University of California, Davis. 20 minutes Turn of the century Irish nationalist writers, encouraged by W.B. Yeats, revived an interest in fairy and folklore, recognizing as their muse Leanhaun Shee, a capricious fairy mistress who persecuted those she inspired. As such, fairyland, like Ireland, was feminized, and like the "work" discussed by literary philosopher Blanchot, it became a "death space" by which the writer was obliterated. 4. Lucretia, Savior and Scapegoat. Cristina G. Calhoon, University of Oregon. 20 minutes Recognized as inspirator of freedom from tyranny, as well as the ideal wife, Lucretia occupies a privileged place in Roman tradition. Combining the best and the worst of her society, Lucretia embodies the requisite ambivalence of the sacrificial victim; her self-immolation restores, in ritual fashion, political unity and communal harmony.</page></plain_text>
