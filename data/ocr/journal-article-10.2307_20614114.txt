And the wind in her goings does whisper them to folks to print for other folks, so other folks do have knowing of earth's songs. When I grow up, I am going to write for children?and grownups that haven't grown up too much?all the earth-songs I now do hear. What happened to the child who, at the age of seven, wrote this pas sage in her journal; of whom, at the age of seventeen, the head of the University of Oregon Department of Geology said, "She may become one of the greatest minds Oregon ever has produced"? Opal Whiteley, in 1986, was eighty-nine years old and had lived nearly forty years in a hospital near London, registered under the name Fran ?oise d'Orl?ans. Her voice seems, for all intents, to have been silent that long. Benjamin Hoff, a writer and investigative reporter, came upon her diary, The Story of Opal Whiteley: The Journal of an Understanding Heart, at a Portland public library. As he glanced through it, he observed that "it had a haunting, time-arresting quality, like the sound of a music box." Hoffs essays accompanying this reissuance of Opal Whiteley's child hood journal, originally serialized in Atlantic Monthly in 1920 to enor mous popular success, convey Hoffs passionate vindication of Whiteley against charges of literary fraud. Here also he describes his costly ef forts?emotionally and financially?to meet with Whiteley in England, and to bring to her in her lifetime some of the recognition he is confident she will ultimately receive. HofPs afterword goes further, portraying Whiteley as a visionary whose vision could, if widely shared, save the race from the environmental and social devastation he foresees. Opal Whiteley's journal is less the subject of this review than is HofPs contribution (which includes renaming the journal's chapters). Some readers will agree with publishers who rejected the journal as "sentimen tal" and "trite." Indeed, her use of anthropomorphism raises legitimate issues of criticism for modern readers. However, to Whiteley's credit, her writing usually avoids the worst excesses of anthropomorphism?in which the cloth of nature is cut to fit the body of human understanding? for she is guileless and young, and her impulses are toward identification with, not control of, nature. Certainly many readers other than Hoff have been moved by White ley's vision and manner of expression: The voice sound came again. Then it was like a voice lost from the person it did belong to. It was a clear, low cry, like a ripple of gray</page><page sequence="3">79 Oregon Historical Quarterly /spring 1987 ribbon. We were more near to it. We followed it around a big tree. There it was, come from the man on the stump between that tree and the big tree that was beyond it. The man, he did throw back his head, and the voice came out his throat and went to nowhere. It came again like little bits of queer green fire-flame. And then it was low, and again like a ripple of gray ribbon. As it was so, he did turn his face about?it was the face of the husband of Sadie McKibben. But the look, the look in his eyes, was a queer, wild look that looked looks at nowhere. Hoff is correct in asserting that "the true story of Opal Whiteley is far more interesting than any of the falsehoods her critics created and en dorsed." However, at this time in its history, Whiteley's critics are part of the story, as is Hoff; it is in part a story as paradoxical as any about an American writer and her public. Hoff convincingly rebuts Whiteley's claim, woven into her journal, that she was not born in Colton, Washington; that her parents were not Mary and Ed Whiteley, but Princess Marie and Henri d'Orl?ans, of the French royal family of Bourbon. He supplies credible explanations for facts that might otherwise be interpreted to support Opal's claim of an exotic birth?for example, how a child raised in Oregon logging settle ments at the turn of the century came to use Latin and French expressions in her journal. Hoff is not convincing in his assertion that Whiteley suffered from schizophrenia, to which he attributes her invention of origins. For a child who early felt intellectually and emotionally estranged from her parents, particularly, apparently, from her mother, the invention of "real" parents is not surprising. Hoff does not cite medical authority as a basis for his diagnosis, and the evidence he does present is circumstantial. There are other ways to account for Whiteley's poor eating habits and increasing fatigue; for her apparently sincere belief in her invented past; for the seemingly contradictory characterizations given her: "shy," "a loner," "warm," "very affectionate." Hoff further claims that the "voices" White ley heard in nature were a manifestation of her disease. They might just as well have been the "songs" heard by a child full of imagination and loneli ness and love. HofPs unsubstantiated diagnosis creates significant problems in un derstanding Opal Whiteley and her place in literature. On the one hand, it threatens to simplify and make precious what Hoff knows to be com plex and often tragic. Further, it is problematical to argue, as Hoff does, that Opal Whiteley's perceptual habits and experience of reality?her 'Values"?would, if widely adopted, result in a sane relation to the natu</page><page sequence="4">8o Oregon Historical Quarterly /spring 1987 ral world, a relation by which the human race might hope to survive, and to argue at the same time that mental illness was parent to her genius. It is on the crucial question of the age at which Whiteley wrote the published journal that Hoff is most convincing. (What has been pub lished is only a small part of all she wrote, and much has been destroyed or lost.) Furthermore, he seems indisputable in contending that her cred ibility and literary career were destroyed (the journal, despite its immedi ate success, was out of print within the year) not because of the quality of the work, or even the question of her origins, but because of the contro versy over her age. He further maintains that many of Whiteley's critics (she also had defenders, such as Ellery Sedgwick, editor of Atlantic Monthly) were malicious and used innuendo, rumor, and lies to discredit her. The controversy raises provocative questions: What motive did her decriers have for destroying her credibility? Was her "differentness" in itself (which was also part of her attractiveness) enough explanation? Having been duped by Whiteley's version of her origins, was the public provoked into disbelieving her on the more important question of age? Given that the writing was of a quality to be convincing, did the critics seriously consider whether it was even important that the writer was a child, or an adult remembering her childhood? To what extent did pre conceptions about the capacities of a small girl raised in Oregon logging camps blind the public and the critics to the capabilities of the real child? To what extent are any of us persuaded to belief simply by our desire to believe?by our preconceptions about what seems possible?ignoring the evidence? Hoff makes clear his identification with and love for Opal Whiteley. He sees in her journal the work of a "uniquely gifted communicator who told of two still largely unknown realms?that of the natural world, and that of childhood." Whiteley, in turn, loved the world with exuberance and curiosity. Her voice is that of a young child discovering in the process of describing?her family, neighbors, nature, and herself; it is a voice governed largely by a powerful and restorative imagination. In his afterword Hoff writes: It is my understanding of the various predictions, and the sign of the natural world, that over the next few years, our planet will act to eliminate mankind's destructive technologies and the unbalanced social and economic systems that perpetuate their application. Its actions will be taken for its own survival and that of the human race_If our planet's accelerating rate of change is the warning that many sensitive observers consider it to be, we have little time left in</page><page sequence="5">8i Oregon Historical Quarterly /spring 1987 which to rearrange our priorities_It would be wise, I believe, to spend that time applying the values ["gentleness, flexibility, and understanding"] expressed in the writing of Opal Whiteley. Indeed, what we can and need to learn from nature is inexhaustible. However, there are dangerous moral implications in positing a world whose intent is to teach human beings. Does the world, then, exist prior to and apart from what it teaches? The idea that nature exists to instruct mankind is hardly reassuring, for the distance is short from that to man the-measure-of- all-things. Hoff makes the interesting point that Opal Whiteley "was a mystery in spite of, and because of, her once great notoriety." And so began his investigation. The facts themselves do not, finally, bring one to an under standing of Whiteley's "enigmatic character." If Opal Whiteley is alive and lucid one hopes that HofPs efforts on her behalf will be of some consolation, and that her work and his (he has written a screenplay) will be received widely and with understanding.
