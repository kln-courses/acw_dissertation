<plain_text><page sequence="1">Much Virtue in Ma: Paradiso xdc, 106, and St. Thomas's Seel contra MOWBRAY ALLAN organization of the Eagle's utterance (not to beg the question) in Paradiso XDC-XX is radically problematic: we know where its answer to the Pilgrim's question about pagans begins, but do we know where it ends? The problem is the relationship between the two cantos. So far as we have achieved a consensus, as in the commentaries, we have found the Eagle's answer in Canto xdc, with the result (or for the reason?) that we take it to discourage the Pilgrim's hope for pagans, hope probably implied in his question and certainly by the poem up to here, most point- edly in Inferno i-iv. Paradiso xx, on the contrary, if taken as part of the Eagle's answer, seems on the face of it an explanation rather of God's grace in saving pagans than of His justice in condemning them. And so as indi- vidual readers, we can often be seen to find hope for pagans, even if not, so puzzling are the ways of God, for the same ones we and the Pilgrim had presumed to hope for, above all. A "consensus reading" cannot be speci- fied exactly, but we can focus on the explicit interpretations and implicit assumptions in Charles S. Singleton's commentary and check them against some others.1 Then we shall test these readings against the form, as well as the content, of St. Thomas Aquinas's solution to the problem, as he recognizes it to be, of validating human prayer vis-a-vis the certain- ty of Divine Predestination. We have been readier to find in the Eagle's words a poetic statement of the ineffability of God's ways than an answer accessible to human intel- 195</page><page sequence="2">Dante Studies, CXI, 1993 lect, being perhaps intimidated by the "anti-humanism" of the Eagle's opening {Par. xdc, 40-99) and concluding {Par. xx, 130-138) assertions: that the justice of God's predestination of souls is above human judgment. In fact, that opening is described by Singleton in his note on Paradiso xrx, 79-81, as "actually no reply at all, but an outburst against man's very pride and presumption in asking any such question in the first place" {Commentary, 320). 2 He supports this interpretation with passages from both Old and New Testaments on the theme of "O man, who art thou to reply to God?" (Job 38 and 39 and Romans 9:20). But we should avoid haste in affirming or denying, without first dis- tinguishing, as Dante's St. Thomas reminds us {Par. xni, 115-116). What is it exactly that the Eagle rejects: the validity and relevance of a human sense of justice towards understanding the Justice by which pagans are judged or rather the assumption the Pilgrim's question makes: that we humans know what God's final judgment on them is? These alternatives will make a decisive difference to the organization we find in or impose upon the Eagle's utterance (and in fact will generate two plausible but very different readings of Cantos xdc-xx): the second will readily accept Canto xx as part of the Eagle's answer and will interpret its conclusion {Par. xx, 130-138) as a restatement of the opening, but with a new (and hopeful?) force, following as it does the revelation of unexpected new facts about God's judgment on pagans. Indeed, so emphasized in Canto xx is the ignorance of "il mondo errante" of the what of God's predestination (w. 67-69 and 133-135), that the less intimidating (and even hopeful) interpretation of the Eagle's opening would be the more obvious one, if it were clear that Canto XX is part of its answer. But xx can instead be plausibly taken as going on to new matter: the review of prominent souls in each sphere (or circle) which has become by now an accustomed aspect of the form of the Commedia. It is in fact as the Pilgrim's expectation of that new matter that Singleton and Musa take the words with which, after the tantalizing pause at the begin- ning of Canto xx, Dante describes the rest of the Eagle's discourse: "parole, / quali aspettava il core ov' io le scrissi" (w. 29-30). They are probably representative of the consensus, in this assumption that the Pilgrim has before this point already received (and resigned himself to?) a negative answer. For, if we assume instead that he is still expecting the completion of the Eagle's answer, these words will recall those urging his question: "Sapete come attento io m'apparecchio / ad ascoltar" {Par. XDC, 196</page><page sequence="3">Much Virtue in Ma: Paradiso XIX, 106, and St. Thomas's Sed contra, mowbray ALLAN 31-32) and his hope to find food for the great and long fast, for which he had found none on earth, especially if we feel that after so powerfully tan- talizing a pause, rendered in "slow motion" as if a moment forever writ- ten in memory, the expected review of souls, however interesting, would seem a bit anticlimactic. And, as it turns out, the Pilgrim pays little atten- tion to David, Constantine, and William, being fixed upon Trajan and Ripheus, behavior which the Eagle seems to accept as quite to be expected. Here then is a further complicating problem: to determine the form of the Eagle's utterance, we shall have to refer it to the context and even to the "subtext" of the Pilgrim's responses to it, and on this point we cannot avoid interpretation: the one of the alternative subtexts just defined is as much an interpretation as the other. Indeed, the context of the satisfaction manifested by the Pilgrim not only at the end of the Eagle's utterance but in the course of it (Par. xlx, 91-96) would seem on the face of it to require more and "deeper" interpretation to reconcile with a hopeless reading than with a hopeful. Singleton pushes the completion of the Eagle's answer even further back, to Canto xlx, 105, finding its essence - presumably, a final and deci- sive negative - to be given in w. 85-90 and 103-105 (see his comment on Par. xlx, 40-42). On this point also, he has probably been accurate in per- ceiving what a hopeless reading requires. For otherwise, the "Ma vedi" which follows immediately would seem to leave the answer without demonstrable closure until its final word, volemo (Par. XX, 138), and in that case it would seem impossible to ignore absolutely, as the recent com- mentaries do, the possibility of a hopeful reading of it, given the evident satisfaction of the Pilgrim's response (xx, 139-148). Let us turn to the passages identified by Singleton as the essence of the Eagle's answer, to judge both whether his reading is valid and whether it is required in order to close the Eagle's answer in time to avoid putting the hopeless reading in question. The first of these is Canto xlx, 85-90, per- haps the most discouraging passage in the Eagle's discourse, closing its long opening statement with the conclusion that Divine Justice measures human justice, not vice-versa, and that human will cannot move the Divine Will: Oh terreni animali! oh menti grosse! La prima volonta, ch'e da se buona, da se, ch'e sommo ben, mai non si mosse. 197</page><page sequence="4">Dante Studies, CXI, 1993 Cotanto e giusto quanto a lei consuona: nullo creato bene a se la tira, ma essa, radiando, lui cagiona. However, there are three passages in Canto xx which, though not expli- citly referred to this first passage or to each other, nevertheless unmistakably comment on it and each other, reopening interpretation of the one above. The first (w. 52-54) describes what Hezekiah learned in Paradise: ora conosce che '1 giudicio etterno non si trasmuta, quando degno preco fa crastino la giu de l'odierno, that is, when it succeeded in delaying the date decreed by God for his death. The third (w. 94-99) begins the explanation of the hidden how of the salvation of pagans who apparently lacked faith and is put in the form of a general statement on the relation of human prayer to the Divine Will: Regnum celorum vi'olenza pate da caldo amore e da viva speranza, che vince la divina volontate: non a guisa che Porno a Tom sobranza, ma vince lei perche vuole esser vinta, e, vinta, vince con sua beninanza. The Divine Will cannot be changed by prayer; yet this fact does not inval- idate prayer, for the changelessness of the Divine Will lies paradoxically and precisely in Its willing to be conquered by prayer. The clause "not as man overcomes man" above corresponds exactly to the interpretive qual- ification St. Thomas always makes when scripture speaks of God "regret- ting" an act of His or "repenting" or "changing" a judgment He has made on some person or nation: that these are anthropomorphic figures which cannot be taken to express the literal truth (see the first three of the arti- cles cited below). That the relationship of these three passages, though not made explic- it, is not fortuitous and that their intention is to make a general statement about the validity of prayer (and not just to comment on Gregory's) will appear almost certain to anyone who will read the following from St. Thomas: (1) Truth (De Veritate), Question Six, Article 6: "Can Predestination Be Helped by the Prayers of the Saints?"; (2) Summa Contra Gentiles, Book 198</page><page sequence="5">Much Virtue in Ma: Paradiso xix, 106, and St. Thomas's Sed contra, mowbray ALLAN Three, Chapters 95-96: "That the Immutability of Divine Providence Does Not Suppress the Value of Prayer"; and these from Summa Theological (3) First Part, Question 19, Article 7: 'Whether the Will of God Is Changeable?"; (4) First Part, Q.23, A.8: 'Whether Predestination Can Be Furthered by the Prayers of the Saints?"; Second Part of the Second Part, Q.83: "Of Prayer," especially (5) A.2: "Whether It Is Becoming to Pray?"; (6) A.7: 'Whether We Ought to Pray for Others?"; and (7) A.11: "Whether the Saints in Heaven Pray for Us?"; and Supplement to the Third Part, Q.71: "Of the Suffrages for the Dead," especially (8) A.5: "Whether Suffrages Profit Those Who Are in Hell?" and (9) A.6: "Whether Suffrages Profit Those Who Are in Purgatory?"3 (In #8, St. Thomas returns a negative answer to the question raised; nevertheless, he acknowledges the possibility that Trajan and "many" other "idolaters" were freed from Hell through Christian prayer. Could this concession have suggested to Dante a departure from Thomas, and the whole previ- ous tradition, in placing virtuous pagans in Limbo?) Each of these articles develops exactly the same theme: to assert the meaning and validity of prayer by defining a middle ground between the opposing errors of holding, on the one hand, that human prayer is futile or superfluous in the face of Predestination, or, on the other hand, that the latter is literally and actually changeable. In #1 St. Thomas responds, "These theories, however, are opposed to the Faith. For the first destroys freedom of choice; the second, the certainty of predestination. Consequently, we must answer the problem differently, and must say that, while God's predestination never changes, prayers and other good works are nevertheless effective in obtaining the effect of predestination.... For, as is clear from The Causes, the first cause gives to the second cause the power of influencing the effect." Predestination, as primary cause, is eter- nal and unchangeable, but its working through human prayer and will and action as second causes gives them their validity. This is the way St. Thomas always vindicates the freedom of human will in the face of inalterable Providence, both in general and in particular manifestations of the difficulty. In developing this theme, St. Thomas cites the prayer of Gregory which freed Trajan from Hell in #1 and #8 above and the prayer of Hezekiah which delayed his death (Isaiah 38:1-5) in #2, #3 and #9. Dante's use of the same examples to make exactly the same points - "Now [Hezekiah] knows that the eternal judgment is not changed" - 199</page><page sequence="6">Dante Studies, CXI, 1993 leaves little doubt that he knew and was thinking of, even appealing to, the vindication of the power of prayer by St. Thomas. The following passage from #2 adds warmth to the theme and, I propose, well summarizes the main theme and the tone of the Eagle's answer: Prayer is not established for the purpose of changing the eternal disposition of providence, since this is impossible, but so that a person may obtain from God the object which he desires. Indeed, it is appropriate for God to consent to the holy desires of a rational creature, not in the sense that our desires may move the immutable God, but that He, in His goodness, takes steps to accomplish these desired effects in a fitting way.... Now, every desire is a certain movement toward the good, and indeed it cannot be present in things unless it be from God, Who is good essentially and the source of goodness. In fact, every mover moves toward something like itself. So, it is proper for God, in accord with His goodness, to bring to a fitting conclusion the proper desires that are expressed by our prayers. The third sentence above ("Now, every desire...") corresponds to Paradiso xx, 99: "vinta, [la divina volontate] vince con sua beninanza." Paradiso xdc, 85-90, far from being "an outburst against man's very pride and pre- sumption in asking any such question" as the Pilgrim's, is precisely the (encouraging?) text that the Eagle is to go on to explicate: "nullo creato bene a se tira [la prima volonta], / ma essa, rad'iando, lui cagiona."4 Indeed, if the Eagle's purpose were as Singleton defines it, then we should have to say that the Pilgrim is a singularly indocile pupil, for it is too much pre- sumption, if anything, that he acquires in this sphere, to judge by the sub- text: in the next he needs a gentle rebuke for prying into the ways of God, in a contingent detail perfectly irrelevant to his conception of the good- ness of God and therefore to his own salvation {Par. xxi, 73-105). The intended reference to each other of these three passages seems obvious once one has brought them together. Yet, it has been left to the reader to do that, perhaps to require our active participation: "Messo t'ho innanzi; omai per te ti ciba" {Par. x, 25). Their congruity, confirmed by the further congruity with St. Thomas's reasoning, is evidence for the hypothesis that there is a more precise unity in the Eagle's discourse than Dante has made explicit - what we might call a dramatic form - and, fur- ther, that the Eagle's answer extends well into Canto xx. In fact, the Eagle will be taken to withhold its full (and hopeful) answer until its final word, volemo, by those who put verses 136-138 of Canto xx into the context of the three passages just analyzed rather than (as do the commentaries) into the context of Piccarda's Christian-stoic abnegation of will.5 Our choice 200</page><page sequence="7">Much Virtue in Ma: Paradiso xrc, 106, and St. Thomas's Sed contra, mowbray Allan of readings of Paradiso xlx-xx comes down to this crucial ambiguity and to our preference for the one of these two contexts over the other. Either preference will be an interpretation, granted, but given that the former is the immediate context, it would seem that the commentaries should rec- ognize the possibility at least of reading the Eagle's final words so: their ignorance of the identities of some of the elect is, to the elect, sweet, "per- che il ben nostro in questo ben s'affina, / che quel che vole Iddio, e noi volemo" (Par. xx, 137-138), sweet, that is, because it makes possible the supreme pleasures of importunate prayer and through it of "vanquishing" God, as did Jacob and Gregory, and as did John the Baptist and other men of violence, according to Matthew 11:12, the verse alluded to in the expla- nation of Gregory's triumph (w. 94-99), and as all Christians are coun- seled to do in Luke ll:5-10.6 A nuance worth observing in the progression of these four passages is this: while the first two emphasize the eternal and the changeless, the point of view of God as First Cause, the second two, though reminding us of that point of view, focus attention instead on the dramatic, on the realm of second causes, of human action and prayer; they take the human point of view, from which, in a valid if limited sense, the Divine Will appears open to change through prayer. (This progression corresponds especially closely to the dialectical movement of thought of St. Thomas in #4 and #5 above.) Even St. Thomas sometimes takes this human point of view, as in referring to "a judgment of God in harmony with lower causes, a judgment which sometimes changes" (#1). The power of prayer - even to the breaking of "duro giudicio la su" (Inf. n, 96) - espe- cially prayer for the salvation of another, or the hastening of it, is one of the great themes of the Commedia, and the Eagle's answer is the place where that theme is most fully asserted and rationalized. The other passage taken by Singleton to answer directly the Pilgrim's question is Paradiso XLX, 103-105, which asserts: "A questo regno / non sail mai chi non credette 'n Cristo, / ne pria ne poi ch'el si chiavasse al legno." But to close the answer at verse 105 is virtually to discount the force of the "Ma vedi" which follows immediately. Most of the other commentaries also fail to register any effect following from that Ma. (Scartazzini-Vandelli does recognize it, but as a digression from the question of pagans: "Non si da salvazione senza fede, ma la fede sola non basta: dev'essere accompa- gnata dalle buone opere.") Perhaps some take it (though none says so) as but the transition to the "cold" comfort of the remainder of Canto XLX: 201</page><page sequence="8">Dante Studies, CXI, 1993 "True, virtuous pagans may be consigned without hope to Limbo, but at least they are not damned so deeply, so far from Paradise, as are many Christians." But at least half of the comments on these lines I have found do not in fact take the place for him who knows not Christ as Limbo only, but as Paradise itself.7 Ma vedi: molti gridan "Cristo, Cristo!" che saranno in giudicio assai men prope a lui, che tal che non conosce Cristo. (xk, 106-108) These lines are taken to allude, as well as to several other passages of scrip- ture, to Matthew 8:11-12: "And I tell you that many will come from east and west to take their places with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob at the feast in the kingdom of heaven; but the subjects of the kingdom will be cast out into the dark, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth." It does seem unlikely that one who had questioned long and incessantly God's justice to virtuous pagans should have failed to note these verses. What is the Pilgrim's probable state of mind after line 108? He can be taken to have received, not a definitive and a negative answer, but a puz- zling paradox: on the one hand, it is true that none has ever been received into Paradise who did not believe in Christ; Ma vedi, it is also true that many who knew not Christ (never heard or read of Him) shall be received into Paradise. Given that the Pilgrim has before now, in Purgatory, met Cato and learned that Trajan is in Paradise, probably in this very sphere, a plausible hypothesis as to his state of mind at the beginning of Canto XX is this: far from resigning himself to a bitter disappointment, he is expec- tantly and even hopefully preparing to receive, finally, the food for his long fast, the "parole, / quali aspettava il core ov' io le scrissi" (w. 29-30). By verses 88-93 of Canto xx, the Pilgrim has, as the Eagle points out, been brought to a state of belief that the two sides of the paradox can be reconciled and of belief that the whole of it is true, but he still does not understand the how of it. The Eagle then begins its explanation of that how, which will occupy the rest of its answer. The "Ma vedi" of Paradiso xdc, 106, can now be attended to and receive its due force, in this reading, and in fact become the central transition, and turning point, in the Eagle's argument. Is there a precedent for the kind of form that is beginning to emerge here, a model which should tend to confirm that we are finding and not merely imposing it and which can 202</page><page sequence="9">Much Virtue in Ma: Paradiso xrx, 106, and St. Thomas's Sed contra, mowbray ALLAN explain Dante's beginning with what seems a negative answer, before making a transition with "Ma vedi" to the complete answer, at the risk of obscuring his purpose (as this complex structure may in fact have done)? There is one which we should not be surprised to see followed here: the dialectic form of several of the treatises of St. Thomas, including the Summa Theologica. Each article of the Summa is headed with a question and begins its answer with Videtur ("It would seem"), introducing an opinion eventual- ly to be refuted, or qualified, or reconciled with the truth. This opinion is supported with evidence, including, often - it is important that this be noted - verses of sacred scripture. Next comes Sed contra ("On the con- trary"), introducing the contrasting opinion, the one to be affirmed, with evidence for it, often, again, including verses from scripture. (In reading an article of St. Thomas through the Sed contra, one can get much the same sense of a puzzling paradox as with verses 103-108 of Canto xlx.) The argument is closed with the Responsio ("Reply"), which justifies the Sed contra against, or explains how it can be reconciled with, the Videtur, and answers the specific objections made in the latter. The articles on Prayer and Predestination cited above are excellent examples of this dialectic form and evidence that Dante might well have had it in mind, in writing Cantos xlx-xx. The (fictional) St. Thomas himself has shown us a version of this method, in Paradiso XIII, where he reconciles the truth of his state- ment that there never rose a second of such wisdom as Solomon with the truth of the unparalleled perfection of Adam and of Christ. (The reader is asked to consider, however, that it is not necessary to accept the specific model for it just proposed, to agree that Dante's "Ma vedi" should not be brushed aside.) St. Thomas's use of the dialectic form can no doubt be explained by the fact that many of the points treated were controversial at the time - as would be the status of virtuous pagans. There is a fairly obvi- ous hypothesis for explaining Dante's use of such a form: assuming that it were his purpose to suggest the possibility of salvation for virtuous pagans, it would be necessary for him to confront the doctrine which would be seen to stand in their way. Paradiso xix-xx can be taken to follow St. Thomas's form fairly closely, including the beginning with a question. The Pilgrim's explicit question is not answered, perhaps because, resting on a false assumption (that the judgment on virtuous pagans presently revealed is the final one), it cannot be; the Eagle's opening can be taken to make this very point. If we assume 203</page><page sequence="10">Dante Studies, CXI, 1993 that the explicit question implies some hope for pagans, then we might take the real question to be: "Shall virtuous pagans be saved?" To that question, the Videtur, the posing of objections to the answer to be affirmed, is XDC, 103-105, asserting the necessity of belief in Christ; the allusion here is probably to Hebrews 11:6: "Without faith it is impossible to please God." It was to this verse that Dante appealed in Monarchia (n, vii, 4-5), where, also in the context of justifying to human reason God's judgment on virtuous pagans, he affirmed the necessity of faith for salva- tion. We, who perhaps have little or no experience of approaching scrip- tural statements as if they are the actual word of God, may for that very reason, when attempting to take to them the point of view of the medieval mind, be the more ready to attribute a finality to them that they did not really have for Dante or St. Thomas. It is not at all unusual in St. Thomas for verses of scripture to appear as evidence for the Videtur p, the opinion to be refuted or qualified: such is the case in all of the articles on prayer cited above, except for #7. I am not suggesting that he attributes no more authority to scripture than to other writing. But it takes no wide reading in Thomas to see that he recognizes that scripture requires interpretation, as we say - that verses of scripture can appear to be inconsistent with each other (or with human reason), unless interpreted and one subordinated to another, in degree of literal truth. In any case, it would not be unusual at all, in St. Thomas, to find a Videtur such as Paradiso xdc, 103-105, supported by a reference to Hebrews 11:6, immediately followed by such a Sed contra ("Ma vedi") as 106-108, supported by references as to Matthew 8:11-12. We can take the Sed con- tra to continue with the supporting examples of the damned Christians and of the saved pagans, Trajan and Ripheus. The Responsio, in this case the explanation of how the apparently conflicting scriptural statements can be reconciled, occupies the remainder of the Eagle's answer (Par. xx, 84-138) and is in fact a response to the Pilgrim's irrepressible question, "Che cose son queste?" Indeed, by implication at least, all of our commentaries do confirm the force of "Ma vedi" and the continuance, with hopeful significance, of the Eagle's answer into Canto xx, for they all put the salvation of Ripheus into the context of ST, 2a2ae, QQ. 1-16: St. Thomas's account of the several different external forms taken by the one saving faith in Christ, in the course of the developing history of Revelation. This context suggests that there is an allusion to Hebrews 11:6 not only in Dante's "Videtur" but 204</page><page sequence="11">Much Virtue in Ma: Paradiso xix, 106, and St. Thomas's Sed contra, mowbray ALLAN also in his "Sed contra" (w. 106-108) and that the passage from Monarchia just cited implies a "Sed contra." For the whole verse reads: "Without faith it is impossible to please God. For he that cometh to God, must believe that He is, and is a rewarder to them that seek Him." St. Thomas cites the first sentence in Q.2, A.3 and Q.I 6, A.1 to assert, as he does unwavering- ly, that faith in Christ is the one way to salvation. For Thomas, however, the second sentence radically qualifies or, if you prefer, "deconstructs," the first: he cites it repeatedly as defining the minimum requirements of "implicit faith," the faith sufficient to Christian salvation but open to Hebrews and to pagans: see especially 2a2ae, Q.I, A.7; Q.2, AA.5 and 8; Q.5, A.1; and Q.I 6, A.1 (in this last, the first sentence appears in the Vxdetur, the second in the Responsio). In Q.I, A.7, for example, Hebrews 11:6 is taken to define "certain pri- mary matters of faith" which contain implicitly all of the articles of explic- it Christian faith: "God's existence, and His providence over the salvation of man.... Thus faith in the Redemption of mankind includes belief in the Incarnation of Christ, His Passion and so forth." In Q.2, A.7 access to this implicit faith is extended to pagans: "Though [pagans who are saved] did not believe in Him explicitly, they did, nevertheless, have implicit faith through believing in Divine providence, since they believed that God would deliver mankind in whatever way was pleasing to Him." This doc- trine is probably alluded to in the explanation of Ripheus's salvation: "Dio li aperse / l'occhio a la nostra redenzion futura" {Par. xx, 122-123). And in fact, Singleton can be seen to read Paradiso XLX-xx hopefully, so far as pagans saved by implicit faith, faith in Christ yet to come: "Cato (Purg. I), Ripheus (Par. XX, 68), and presumably many another pagan must not be forgotten here" (note on Par. xxxii, 19-20; Commentary, 536). He does not speculate explicitly about pagans (such as Virgil, if saved) whose faith, like Trajan's, would be in Christ crucified.8 But (in his note on Par. xx, 106) Singleton does quote the passage from #8 above in which St. Thomas generalizes the salvation of Trajan: "The same applies to all those who were miraculously raised from the dead, many of whom were evidently idolaters and damned" (Commentary, 341). Is it fair to say, then, that the interpretive tradition has read the Eagle's answer as hopeful? Probably, on the theological level, but probably not, on the aesthetic. Speculations, however generous, about unidentified pagans who may have been saved by implicit faith, or even after the manner of Trajan, will never amount to more than a negligible addition to our read- 205</page><page sequence="12">Dante Studies, CXI, 1993 ing of the Commedia, as literature. This is borne out in Michelangelo Picone's recent essay, "La Viva speranza' di Dante e il problema della salvezza dei pagani virtuosi." Though his title suggests hope and though he discusses the case of Gregory and Trajan at length, when he comes to generalize his conclusions about the salvation of pagans, Picone appears to read the "caldo amore" and "viva speranza" of Paradiso XX, 95 as referring exclusively to motives required of the pagan herself or himself, that is, to implicit faith: "Chi ha voluto awicinarsi a Dio, anche se vissuto alFinter- no della cultura pagana, ha ricevuto i mezzi per poterlo fare: gli e bastato, afferma Dante, averlo desiderato ardentemente e sperato attivamente" (257). But such a restriction seems incorrect. Virgil certainly could not meet the standard set by Ripheus, but then neither could Trajan have been capable of "viva speranza" in Limbo (see Par. XX, 106-107), and thus of accomplishing his own salvation without Gregory's help. Further, accord- ing to the probabilities of syntax and rhetoric, the wording of verse 95 ("viva speranza") should refer equally or even primarily to Gregory's living hope, "viva spene, che mise la possa / ne' prieghi fatti a Dio per suscitar- la" (w. 109-110). Having thus discounted the general significance of the example of Trajan, Picone goes on to find in Paradiso xx not hope for Virgil and Aeneas, but a positive rejection of them, imputed to Dante ("the anx- iety of influence"?): a revisionist Aeneid whose hero is not Aeneas but Ripheus: "La creazione del nuovo mito di Rifeo assumera allora il valore non di un postremo omaggio alia poesia di Virgilio (come suona il com- mento tradizionale), ma della resa finale dei conti poetici fra Eneide e Commedia" (267). It is the bearing of the Eagle's answer on the virtuous pagans now in Limbo and, above all, Virgil, which will determine our sense of whether that answer is significantly hopeful or not. (What pagans, more worthy of salvation than these, can we be thinking of, as potential objects of God's saving grace? Or can we be thinking that Divine Grace suspends, rather than transcends, Divine Justice?) Our leaving the important question of pagans in a state of vague ambiguity - answering it negatively as we aim at an explicit and "objective" consensus, often affirmatively as we interpret as individuals - is probably due to failure to take seriously the possibility of its hopeful implication for Virgil. It is precisely Virgil who actualizes our concern for justice to virtuous pagans in general, which was there but inoperative: without his involvement in it, the question of pagans has probably not seemed important enough to insist on resolution.9 206</page><page sequence="13">Much Virtue in Ma: Paradiso xix, 106, and St. Thomas's Sed contra, mowbray ALLAN At the beginning of our journey, Virgil rebuked and corrected, in the Pilgrim and the Poet and the Reader, a failure of confidence in the face of a great past so far beyond our daring. In our ("voi mortali") long and unsatisfied doubts about the justice done to pagans, as if in a determinate past beyond hope, the Eagle finds and chastises a similar abdication of our parts in sacred history and, as Virgil had, shows Justice to be "giustizia viva," still within the reach of "viva speranza." In Paradiso xlx-xx, Dante can be observed to follow St. Thomas exactly, in recognizing two ways through which pagans may attain salvation. It is the one not limited to the past or even to the present, the one opening Dante's text to the future (as does Beatrice's promise to Virgil), the way exemplified by the importu- nate prayers of Gregory, that we have failed in the main to generalize explicitly. I would guess, from my perspective, that this failure is due above all to the formidable power of Virgil's own despair to suppress a reading incom- patible with itself. For I can find no other reasons in the text which can explain our trying to confine the Eagle's answer to Canto XLX, even as the relevance of XX has continued to force itself on our attentions, or our balk- ing at the salvation of the one pagan in whose favor we know prayers will be offered, even as we generously admit to Paradise an indeterminate number of unidentified pagans. Why else do we define the Eagle's answer as negative and its tone as discouraging, in the face of the considerable hope we actually find in Canto xx - more than hope in the cases of Trajan and Ripheus? But Virgil's despair cannot be conclusive evidence for its own validity, for this is just the point on which his authority as our guide to Hell must be suspect: his hopeless view of his own and his fellows' state can represent not objective knowledge of definitive theological truth but only itself, his present participation in the defining condition of Limbo, to be taken, from the point of view of the poet and of the reader, as a source of irony and of drama. Of the elect, Trajan at least would certainly once have shared Virgil's despair (Par. XX, 106-107).10 In ST, 3a, Suppl., Q.71 (the same question from which #8 and #9 above come, suggesting Dante's familiarity with it), A.2: "Whether the Dead Can Be Assisted by the Works of the Living?" St. Thomas considers the following objection: "It belongs only to one who is on the way to advance on account of some deed. Now after death men are no longer wayfarers." To this he replies, "Although, strictly speaking, after death souls are not in the state of the way, yet in a certain respect they are still 207</page><page sequence="14">Dante Studies, CXI, 1993 on the way, in so far as they are delayed awhile in their advance toward their final award." In promoting pagans to Limbo, Dante may have been simply making explicit the implications of this teaching, when connected with St. Thomas's acknowledgment, in A.5 of the same Question, that Trajan and "many" other "idolaters" were probably freed from Hell. Inferno TV, 76-78, shows that the Limbo of virtuous pagans is still within the reach of God's grace and of human prayers and good wishes and could prove a temporary abode, unless there has been some change of policy - or loss of nerve - since the time of Gregory: L'onrata nominanza che di lor suona su ne la tua vita, grazia acquista in ciel che si li avanza. Note the close correspondence of this passage with Beatrice's address to Virgil, reported in Inferno n: her respectful attitude to his enduring fame in the world and suggestion that the good his timeless words still bring to those who hear them, as well as his service to the Pilgrim, can win him grace in Heaven. In the reading proposed above, the Sphere of Justice becomes, not the place which above all reveals a rupture between Dante the humanist and Dante the Christian, but the place of the reconciling of the two, after, no doubt, some earlier strains. It is quite appropriate, however, to lay the main stress on Christian, in defining Dante's humanism, for it is exactly the power of Christian prayer - as against the futility of pagan prayer to bend the will of heaven, once confessed by Virgil the poet and confirmed by Virgil the shade (Purg. VI, 28-46) - that reveals the pattern, in the uni- verse, which answers to "intelletto umano" and its hunger for justice, and also promises to enable the pagan champions of human intellect to fulfill their quests, in "quelle Atene celestiali, dove li Stoici e Peripatetici e Epicurii, per la luce de la veritade etterna, in uno volere concordevole- mente concorrono" (Convivio, ill, xiv).

All citations of the text of the Commedia and of the translation and of the commentary of Charles S. Singleton are from his edition, Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy, 6 vols. (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1970-1975). Though there are signs that Dante criticism of the middle of this century - that in English at least - sensed that the Eagle's conclusion left the question of pagans open, I can find no explicit acknowledgment that a hopeful reading of the Eagle's answer (i.e., hopeful for pagans now in Limbo) was ever thought possible, either in Singleton's commentary or in the recent ones I have compared with his: by Mark Musa in his The Divine Comedy, 3 vols. (New York: Penguin, 1984-1986) and by Anthony Oldcorn and Daniel Feldman, with Giuseppe Di Scipio, on Paradiso, in Allen Mandelbaum, The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri, 3 vols. (New York: Bantam, 1982-1986). The same is true of La Divina Commedia: Testo critico delta Societa Dantesca Italiana, comm. G. A. Scartazzini, rev. Giuseppe Vandelli (1937), 21st ed. (Milano: Ulrico Hoepli, 1979), which has been most useful in this study; it contains a running paraphrase of the whole Commedia and thus allows one to observe a more or less complete reading. The following essays suggest the emergence of a new consensus on a "hopeless" reading of Paradiso XDC-xx, significantly different from the old. It may originate in Kenelm Foster's The Two Dantes and Other Studies (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1977), 137-253; the others seem to make use of his illuminating study of "implicit faith" in St. Thomas, a faith open to pagans. For all these writers, this potentially hopeful, humanistic concept weighs against the sal- vation of Virgil and others in Limbo, for the reason that they should already be saved, if by implicit faith. Indeed, Foster and Robert Hollander, at least, agree in speculating that Virgil's damnation might be explained by his having rejected an opportunity for implicit faith. In any case, Dante's failure to save Virgil is seen as the more significant and decisive, in the light of implicit faith: "Yes, he could save Vergil. That is precisely why it is important that he does not," as Teodolinda Barolini argues on page 141 of her note ("Q: Does Dante Hope for Vergil's Salvation? A: Why Do We Care? For the Very Reason We Should Not Ask the Question (Response to Mowbray Allan [MLN 104])," MLN, cv, 1, January, 1990, 138-144). These recent critics do find Canto XX to be part of the Eagle's answer, and for that very reason see a partial but positive rejection of Virgil on Dante's part: "The cruelty of saving Ripheus but not his author makes Dante's volition stand out still more clearly," as Hollander puts it on page 251 of his essay, "Tragedy in Dante's Comedy" (Sewanee Review, xci, Spring, 1983, 240-260). Unlike the previous consensus, this new one acknowledges that modern readers cannot easily share in the Pilgrim's seeming satisfaction with (this hopeless reading of) the Eagle's answer, explained by the com- mentaries, so far as explained at all, by assimilating it to Piccarda's Christian-stoic abnegation of will (see the comments on Par. XX, 136-138). Foster does not conceal his puzzlement and even distress at what he believes Dante to have done in these cantos. This far more precise, anxious and searching exploration of what we could call the "subtext," and of the implications, of the Pilgrim's and the Eagle's dialogue has led these writers to question the endurance to the end of Dante's earlier humanist project and, in the case of Michelangelo Picone, even of his Thomism: he finds in Paradiso xx "l'indicazione del passaggio da una fase 'umanistica' della cultura di Dante (rappresentata dalFenciclopedia filosofica del Convivio), da un momento cioe nel quale Dante crede alia continuita fra mondo classico e mondo cristiano; a una fase per cosl dire 'agostiniana,' ... a un momento cioe nel quale Dante si rende conto dello sbarramento esistante fra mondo clas- sico e mondo cristiano (significato dalFIncarnazione)." See pages 264-265 of his article, "La 'viva speranza' di Dante e il problema della salvezza dei pagani virtuosi," Quademi d'italianistica, X, 1-2 (1989), 251-268. And the very title of Foster's book alludes to his sense that in the end Dante the Christian was unable to assimilate Dante the Humanist. What I find missing in this new consensus, as in the old, is equal attention to the other way to salvation opened to pagans in Canto xx, exemplified by Trajan's salvation through the impor- tunate prayers of Gregory, and to the general significance of the statements there about the power of prayer for the salvation of another. It is the aim of the present essay to redress this imbalance. 209</page><page sequence="16">Dante Studies, CXI, 1993 Dante may not have intended any distinction in merit between these two ways; he so emphasized the initiative of Divine Grace in Ripheus's salvation that Foster concluded - wrongly, I now think - that his is not an instance of salvation by implicit faith (184-185, 188, and 251-252). For recent hopeful readings of the Eagle's response, see Nicolae Iliescu, "Will Virgil Be Saved?" Mediaevalia, xii (1989 for 1986), 93-114; Karla Taylor, "From Superbo Ilwn to Umile Italia" Stanford Italian Review, VII (1987), 47-65; Mowbray Allan, "Does Dante Hope for Virgil's Salvation?" mln, civ (January, 1989), 193-205, and "Two Dantes: Christian versus Humanist?" MLN, evil (January, 1992), 18-35, as well as the "Response to Teodolinda Barolini," MLN, cv (January, 1990), 144-147 (see above in this note; Barolini added a "Second Response to Mowbray Allan," 147-149, in that same issue). The fact that my essays heretofore have been written with- out the help of Nicolae Iliescu's forceful argument, due to its delayed publication, might be taken to add some support to our readings, so far as they agree. Briefly, we agree in stressing Beatrice's promise to praise Virgil often to her Lord (Inf. II, 73-74) as explicitly opening the possibility of his salvation, in pointing to the "Ma vedi" of Par. XK, 106, and in reading Par. XX, 133-135, as an explicit statement that God's final judgment on pagans has not yet been revealed. The hope sensed by those who do not read the Eagle's response as clearly and explicitly hope- ful is perhaps more significant. I aim to show that most of the readings here referred to are implicitly ambivalent as to Dante's hopes for pagans. 2.

See also Allan, "Does Dante," 198-199, "Two Dantes," 32-34, and Foster, The Two Dantes, 146-151. 5. In ST, 2a2ae, Q.83, A.11: "Whether the Saints in Heaven Pray for Us?" St. Thomas con- siders the objection that "the saints conform their will to God perfectly, so that they will only what God wills. Now what God wills is always fulfilled. Therefore it would be useless for the saints to pray for us." To this he replies that "the saints impetrate [obtain by prayer] whatever God wishes to take place through their prayers [emphasis mine]: and they pray for that which they deem will be granted through their prayers according to God's will." Observe the slight ambigu- ity that Thomas must leave in the saints' knowledge, in order to validate prayer by them: on the one hand, their sense of what God has willed must fall slightly short of certainty, for them to pray at all; on the other, they must deem (and no doubt always rightly!) that what they pray for shall be accomplished. This, I should think, is exactly the same nuance of ambiguity we find in Dante's account of the saints' prayers (Par. XX, 134-138), with the added touch that this teasing ambigu- ity makes possible the refinement of their beatitude. There are two additional points to be observed here. The Christian-stoic abnegation of will praised by Piccarda and the doctrine of importunate prayer triumphing over God's will formulated in the Eagle's answer are indeed the two sides of the same (and very thin?) theological coin; yet, even if what separates them should seem to us only the breadth of a hair, that hair still makes all the difference for interpretation of the Eagle's answer. Further, taking it in the context of the two passages from Thomas just above and of Piccarda's restatement of his teaching, should we not recognize Beatrice's promise to praise Virgil often to her Lord (Inf. II, 73-74) as putting the hopeless reading of the Eagle's answer into question, at the 210</page><page sequence="17">Much Virtue in Ma: Paradiso xix, 106, and St. Thomas's Sed contra, mowbray ALLAN least? Is it plausible that Dante should have put that promise into her mouth with less than full deliberation? In short, beginning with the very first canto of the poem, has not Dante carefully prepared the way for the Pilgrim's question in Paradiso xrx? 6. Verses 137-138 in Paradiso XX also suggest a hypothesis for explaining why, assuming Virgil's salvation to have been his intention or hope, Dante might have abstained from an explic- it announcement of it - especially, as already accomplished, by implicit faith: to make it far more dramatic and involving. Compare the Eagle's dramatic handling of the explicit announcements it does make. 7. See the comments on these lines in Mandelbaum, Musa, and Scartazzini-Vandelli and on pages 256-257 of Michelangelo Picone's essay cited above. If one takes Singleton's citations of Matthew 12:41-42 and 25:31-46 in his notes on verses 109-1 10 of Paradiso xrx (Commentary, 324) to amount to the same interpretation, he can be added to the list. 8. Observe that in Paradiso XX, 103-105 and 112-117, Trajan's salvation has been defined by the time of his act of faith, not of his life, with the result - and for the purpose? - that pagans saved as he was, even if they lived before Christ, should be assigned to the still unfilled half of the Rose - compare Paradiso xxxii, 19-27. 9. See Teodolinda Barolini's acute analysis of readers' responses to Dante's Virgil (in MLN, 1990, see note 1 above) and elsewhere, an analysis which I have come to agree with more and more, except for the hypothesis that Dante creates our affection for Virgil so that we shall then experience the pain of renunciation. 10. In Beatrice's description of Adam's state, in the Limbo before Christ, though the words "sanza speme" are not used, the very words which name the consequences and the experience of the pagans' hopelessness in Limbo (see Inf. rv, 41-42 and DC, 17-18) are used of Adam: "in pena e in disio" (Purg. xxxiii, 61-63).
