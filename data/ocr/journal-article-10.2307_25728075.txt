<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews The Best Divisions for Knowledge of the Regions (Ahsan al-taqasim fi macrifat al aqdllm). By al-Muqaddasi, Shams al-Din Abu cAbd Allah Muhammad ibn Ahmad. Translated by Basil Collins. (Great Books of Islamic Civilization). Pp. 426. Reading: Garnet Publishing, 2001. ?18.00. This translation of Muqaddasfs (334-390/945-1000) celebrated geographical trea tise of the 4th/10th century forms part of a larger project which seeks to make avail able to the English language reader a diverse selection of classical compilations from the formative years of the Islamic tradition. The project focuses on those works dis tinguished within their respective fields of learning and will include traditional disci plines such as the Qur'anic sciences, the Prophetic traditions, jurisprudence and the ology, together with works on sciences of a rather more abstract nature such as astron omy, physics, chemistry, medicine and fields of study such as geography and horti culture; given the extensive nature of these works and their conceptual variety, the selection of Muqaddasfs remarkable text for this series of translations is especially fitting for whilst it represents a geographical account of the lands of Islam as depict ed through the eyes of an itinerant geographer, it also creatively places conventional scientific abstraction, empirical investigation, and a well-embellished literary narra tive within an Islamic framework; besides, this cohesive blending of approaches was one of the definitive features of the so-called BalkhT or Classical school of geography and Muqaddasi was its most renowned exponent. The contents of this book and its primary purpose are eminently circumscribed by Muqaddasfs preliminary remarks which establish the framework for the work. He states that it was intended to be 'an account of the Islamic regions, with the deserts and the seas in them; the lakes and rivers there; a description of their famous metrop oles, and noted settlements: the way stations that are well used and the roads that are frequented', adding T will state in my account the ingredients of their medicaments and drugs, the sources and cargoes of commerce; the diversity of the peoples of the countries in their expressions, intonations, languages, complexions; their doctrinal schools, their measures, their weights, their coins, large and small; with particulars of their food and drink, their fruits and waters' (p. 1). Moreover, he boasts that this was to be 4a work travellers and merchants cannot do without'. It was the meticulous attention to detail expressed so stylistically which rendered Muqaddasfs text so valu able, serving as a portal into the classical Islamic world. It is worth noting that this is not the first time that Muqaddasfs text has been the sub ject of a translation. Collins' preface to this publication includes an elaborate survey</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 83 of the various manuscripts of Muqaddasf s work and the different translations. This is followed by an introduction which provides a refined digest of the development of Islamic geography, highlighting the eminent status of this text not only within the classical Islamic tradition but also within contemporary Western scholarship: it was the subject of no less than six previous translations. These appeared in German, French, and English; however, they were not complete renditions of Muqaddasf s treatise, instead they focused on specific chapters and selected passages from the work. The most comprehensive of which was the effort by G. Ranking and R. Azoo, which was published as fascicles in 1897, 1899, 1901 and 1910, covering pp. 1-202 of this text, whilst the translation of A. Miquel also covered extended parts of the text and included an in-depth commentary. The manuscript source of all these translations was scrupulously derived by Michael Jan de Goeje from two apographs and first pub lished in 1877 as the third volume of Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum: this was revised and published as a second edition in 1906. The previous translations of Muqaddasf s work were all based on de Goeje's derived text, which did not include the maps found in the two apographs, although Collins, like others before him, made use of this illustrative material. Furthermore, Collins was also responsible for one of these earlier translations. This was published under the title Al-Muqaddasi: The Man and His Work; With Selected Passages Translated from the Arabic, (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1974). Given his earlier translation of representative sections of Muqaddasf s text which includes his authoritative study of its author, it is evident that Collins not only has an assured command of the literary sources for Arabic geography but he also shows a profound appreciation of the significance of this text. And this is reflected in his assiduous approach to its translation. The genre of works entitled al-masalik wa}l-mamalik (books on routes and realms) represented the earliest examples of geographical literature. It was a secretary by the name of Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 272/885) whose work was to provide a 'blueprint' for subsequent Arabic geographical literature. (See Maqbul Ahmad's entry entitled 'Djughrafiya' in the Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd edn). It is maintained that this work must have been based on antecedents; moreover, an extrinsic influence is also per ceptible in the conventions and divisions employed in this and other early works; such material was largely patterned on Greek, Iranian and Indian concepts. Despite being replete with geographical, mathematical, and astronomical data, several of the authors of these early works were secretaries and administrators. It is argued by both Collins and Ahmad that the works of this early period were plainly 'secular' in their per spective. A transformation in respect of approaches was intrepidly ventured with the advent of the Balkfri school and its putative founder Abu Zayd al-Balkhi (d. 322/934), the author of a work entitled Suwar al-aqalim. It is the Islamic element that becomes particularly pronounced not only in the general philosophy of these writings, but also</page><page sequence="3">84 Journal of Qur'anic Studies in respect of their specific focus: literature by geographers of the Balkhl school con centrated only on the realm of Islam (the geographical compass of the masalik wa'l mamalik works was more extensive). Indeed, Muqaddasi asserts that he did not con cern himself with the terrain outside the realm of Islam ('the countries of unbeliev ers') unless of course there were Muslim inhabitants therein (p. 8 of Collins' transla tion). Moreover, the literature of the Balkhi geographers revealed a concerted attempt to reconcile and illustrate geographical description with Qur'anic and Prophetic dicta, giving the Islamic element greater definition; this was coupled with the use of car tography (see pp. 312-15 of the article entitled 'Geographical and Navigational Literature' by J. Hopkins, Religion, Learning, and Science in the Abbasid period, ed. M. Young (et al.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990). Muqaddasi did have predecessors who were adherents of this school: figures such as Istakhri (d. 350/961) and Ibn Hawqal (d. 380/990); the former was the author of a trea tise incidentally entitled al-Masalik wa'l-mamalik, supposedly based on Abu Zayd's text, and the latter wrote a work entitled Surat al-ard. However, Muqaddasfs text was to surpass the works of his predecessors: for it integrated scientific, religious and liter ary components with such dazzling effect. Indeed, Muqaddasi in his rather candid sum mary of previous geographical literary endeavours does speak of his dissatisfaction with previous writings in the field: this inspired him to take upon himself the task of com posing his text. Whilst he certainly consulted previous writings, often referring to works by earlier geographers, much of the work was derived through his own experiences as an itinerant geographer: he spent 20 years passing through the different towns, cities, and provinces of the Islamic regions: in his own words, 'I could not complete the com pilation of it until after my travels throughout the countries, and my visiting the regions of Islam; until after I had met the learned, and been of service to princes, had meetings with the qadhis, and studied under the jurists; had frequented the society of men of let ters, the readers of the Qur'an, and writers of the traditions; had associated with asce tics and the Sufis' (p. 2 of the translation). Collins mentions that Muqaddasi personally traversed most of the Islamic regions with the exception of al-Andalus and al-Sind (see p. 19 ofAl-Muqaddasi: The Man and His Work; With Selected Passages Translated from the Arabic). The description of his trials and tribulations is a harrowing one: he recounts how he was close to drowning, robbed by highwaymen, confined in prison, and accused of being a spy; indeed, he even speaks of a plot to murder him (p. 42 of the translation). It is this fascinating and often witty narrative furnished by Muqaddasi which provides the text with a very personal quality and Collins has skilfully managed to retain this in his translation, conveying the dynamic combination of features which engagingly dis tinguished Muqaddasfs text. Whether one is referring to its utility as a source of polit ical, historical, social and linguistic documentation or indeed the value of the religious material which it ingeniously preserves, Muqaddasfs text is invaluable.</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 85 It is intriguing to note that a cursory comparison of Collins' earlier translation of sec tions from Muqaddasf s text with this current work shows a large number of changes and refinements made to his earlier translation; however, this would seem to indicate the sustained nature of the effort made by Collins in his quest to capture the substance and style of the original text; moreover, it also highlights the complexities and diffi culties inherent in translating classical texts of this nature. Collins has presented a thoroughly readable and entertaining translation: this is no mean achievement given the variegated nature of Muqaddasf s text and his inclination to resort to the use of rhymed prose for rhetorical effect. The translation crucially enables its reader to savour the tenor of the Arabic original. Furthermore, this is all accomplished without departing immoderately from the literal language of the text. Besides, the text is also replete with defined lists of place names, commodities, and material of a technical nature in addition to theological, juridical, exegetical and linguistic anecdotes. There are a number of passages in the translation which do deserve consideration. In the resourceful chapter on 'Dhikr al-madhahib wa'l-dhimma', translated by Collins as 4 Account of the Madhdhib (Schools of Islamic Law) and the Dhimma (Free Non Muslim Subjects)', Muqaddasi initially identifies the principal legal and theological schools of Islam before moving on to assert that these schools were divided into innu merable sub-groups and often granted secondary labels. However, Muqaddasf s point was that these schools were in essence already enumerated in his earlier classifica tion; the secondary designations, of which there were four classes, were no more than allusions to these previously identified schools. These included nicknames; names denoting commendation; names intimating an opprobrious trait; and in the final class were those labels concerning which there was a difference of opinion. Referring to the passage which identifies the opprobrious class, Collins states: 'Disavowal: al Kullabiyya, who disavow divine constraint on man; al-Hanbaliyya, disavowed for their hatred of CAH; those who do not recognise the attributes of God and are dis avowed because of their anthropomorphism; and those who disavow all the attributes of God' (pp. 34-5 of the translation). Given that Muqaddasi is referring in these two instances to a pejorative connotation inherent in the use of such labels, it would seem logical that the Kullabiyya are actually accused by their opponents of adopting jabr (a deterministic bent) and labelled accordingly, despite any protestations against such accusations. Similarly, the Hanbalites are referred to as ahl al-nasb, which Lane's lexicon confirms, through references to al-Qdmils al-muhlt and Taj al-carus, was an allusion to a sect of possible Kharijite origins who felt it was a matter of religious obligation to bear intense hatred forc AH; the same term is used disparagingly to refer to the Hanbalites, obviously by their detractors (a detailed discussion of this is presented in the notes of Ranking and Azoo). There is also the context in which the terms are themselves introduced: Muqaddasi is referring to that fact that these</page><page sequence="5">86 Journal of Qur'anic Studies conventional schools are known by other labels. Complex passages of this nature present the translator with a perplexing choice and yet the way they are translated is critical to a precise understanding of the text, although in fairness to Collins he does class these theological schools under the heading 'disavowal'. Moreover, it is the next part of the translation which is problematic because of the contradiction it creates. The Arabic reads 'wa-munkiru al-sifat yunkirun al-tashbih; wa-muthbituhd yunkirun al-tactiV (p. 37 of the Arabic text), which means those who deny the attributes (do so in order to) reject anthropomorphism; whilst those who affirm (the attributes) reject (any) negation (of them). Collins' translation reads 'those who do not recognise the attributes of God and are disavowed because of their anthro pomorphism; and those who disavow all the attributes of God.' It is interesting to note that the rendition of this whole passage by Ranking and Azoo reads: 'The blamed ones are: Kullabiyya, condemned for the doctrine of compulsion in human actions: al-Hanbaliyya censured for their hatred of 'Ali; the muthbitu al-sifat (attributists) condemned for representing God as similar to man; munfu al-sifat (deniers of attrib utes) blamed for rejecting all eternal attributes of God' (pp. 52-3: Ranking and Azoo). The version translated in these passages was obviously based on the first edition of de Goeje's manuscript (1877) and the variant wording found therein is referred to in the footnotes of the 1906 revised edition. To their credit the translation of Ranking and Azoo did comprise an illuminating commentary, with many of the aforemen tioned intricacies explained with a profusion of references to primary source materi al. It is perhaps useful to note that Watt adduces a reference to the Kullabiyya com prised in these introductory passages to argue that in the early tradition they were the true precursors of the Ashcariyya, but that Abu'l-Hasan al-Ashcari was subsequently made the eponym of this school, although this can in no way attenuate the signifi cance of his contribution to a synthesis of Sunni orthodoxy (see The Formative Period of Islamic Thought, Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 1997, p. 311). In the same chapter Muqaddasfs reference to ahl al-ra?y and ahl al-hadith (p. 35 of the translation) is qualified by Collins as 'people of subjective opinion - followers of the madhhab of Abu Hanifa' and 'followers of tradition - the madhdhib of Malik, ShaficT, and Ibn Hanbaf respectively. Studies have tended to show that the term ahl al-ra?y was not just a reference to the tradition of Hanafi jurists, rather its semantic compass was much greater as it denoted those schools of jurisprudence who upheld the validity of legal reasoning; and thus it encompasses a number of the other tradi tional schools of jurisprudence (see pp. 14-15 of W. Hallaq, A History of Islamic Legal Theories: An Introduction to Sunni Usui al-Fiqh, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997; cf. pp. 57-8 of Islamic Philosophy and Theology, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1987).</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 87 Amongst the other parts of the translation warranting brief attention are the follow ing: the phrase Ja-hiya ahaqqu bi-find^iha" in the chapter on the jazlrat al-carab (the Peninsula of the Arabs) is translated as 'the greater right attaches to the surrounding space' (p. 69 of the translation). This occurs in the context of Abu Hanifa's advice to the caliph concerning the purchase of property in the vicinity of the Kacba in order to extend and renovate the sacred precincts and should read 'it (al-kacba) has more right to its surrounding enclosure'; in Muqaddasi's recounting of the exquisite merits of iqlim al-shdm (the Clime of Syria), he resolves to enumerate some of its drawbacks and defects (cuyub), translated by Collins as 'disadvantages', moving on to state 'al mastur mahmum; wa'l-ghani mahsiid; wa'l-faqlh mahjur; wa'l-adib ghayru mashud\ This is translated by Collins as follows: 'the blameless are aggrieved, the rich envied. The jurisprudent is in solitude, and the man of letters disregarded' (p. 141 of the translation); whilst Ranking and Azoo's translation reads: 'The meek are molested and the rich envied; jurisconsults remain unvisited and erudite men are for gotten' (p. 274). The phrase al-mastur mahmum might be translated as 'the person of modest means is aggrieved', particularly as an antithesis is implied with the phrase al-ghani mahsud', whereas al-faqih mahjur suggests a ruefully neglected or shunned jurist. Finally, the expression wa'l-adib ghayru mashud must refer to the litterateur not being frequented. In the same chapter (p. 144) Muqaddasi mentions a spring located in the village of Sulwan, describing its waters as sweet (cudhaybiyya, the diminutive form of cadhb, although several variants of this term are cited in the man uscript's footnotes, p. 171 of the Arabic text, including cadhiba). This is translated by Collins as 'water of moderate quality' and Ranking and Azoo as 'fairly good water' (p. 280). It is the case that the lexicon of Ibn Faris (d. 395/1004) entitled Mujmal al lugha records that al-cadhb is al-md3 al-tayyib (fine water) (vol. 2, p. 656); however, it also confirms that the renowned 2nd/8th century Kufan philologist Lihyani refers to ma3 fihi cadhiba(tun), as 'water containing impurities'; and yet one wonders whether sweet water was actually intended in Muqaddasf s text given that he relates how these waters fed magnificent gardens. In respect of its production, this is an accomplished edition. Not only is the pagina tion of de Goeje's original included in the margins of the book, but Collins has also provided variant versions and additions to this text collated from different manu scripts. He has also isolated the various lacunae in the manuscripts used for this edi tion. Having also included twenty maps, he has painstakingly provided English keys to these maps in the book's appendix. It is, however, difficult to understand why a full-system of diacritics was not used in the transliteration of the Arabic given the overall quality of this book: the text only makes use of macrons along with apostro phes to denote the guttural and glottal stops. Moreover, the index for this volume is less than comprehensive and given the book's value as a reference source, this needs</page><page sequence="7">88 Journal of Qur'anic Studies to be addressed. Amongst the typographical errors which I came across were: the inside cover of the first page refers to authorisation by al-Ahzar instead of al-Azhar; Khwarij instead of Khawarij (p. 34); Yahsibi instead of Yahsubi (p. 36); all of the page headings for the section entitled madhdhib (p. 34) read madhdib; al-Hujjaj ibn Yusuf instead of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf (p. 334). It should be said that anyone with an interest in the classical Islamic tradition would want to acquire this volume. Collins' translation leaves one with the distinct impres sion he has successfully presented a generally accurate, fluent, and discerning ren dering of the original Arabic text. This will be especially appreciated by readers with recourse only to the English language, given the academic value of Muqaddasfs text. And this fulfils one of the objectives of this book series. Additionally, students of Arabic and Islamic studies will also find this text of use, particularly in exploring techniques used in the translation of classical material. This publication is highly rec ommended. MUSTAFA SHAH</page></plain_text>
