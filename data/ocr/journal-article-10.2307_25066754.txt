Norman Kutcher, Syracuse University If Michael Szonyi uses one word more than any other to charac terize kinship practices in the vicinity of late imperial Fuzhou, it is "flexibility." This important and carefully argued book opens with an illustration of flexibility at work, describing Guo Bocang and his brother Guo Boy in, both nationally prominent officials, celebrating their Fuzhou lineage's strict adherence to canonical requirements in</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 493 a preface composed for their family genealogy. In reality, they and their kin interpreted these requirements flexibly, resulting in kin ship practice that was a compromise between canonical require ments and family traditions. The case of the Guo brothers was typ ical of the ways in which canonical requirements were flexibly interpreted. In the chapters that follow Szonyi traces this flexibility through five important aspects of Fuzhou society that he conceives in widening concentric circles: the genealogy, the legacy of kinship organization from the Ming, the ancestral hall, the rituals of the ancestral hall, and the relationship of state policy to lineage and local cult. "Flexibility" at times appears to be a euphemism for a more subtle underlying dynamic: that kinship practices were often marked by a professed conformity to state-sponsored orthodoxy that concealed strategic compromises between orthodoxy and local and lineage needs. Appropriately, Szonyi's book begins with the genealogy, which was central to kinship practice in Fuzhou, as elsewhere. In the genealogy, flexibility in matters of kinship recording essentially meant flexibility with the facts. Szonyi shows how genealogies added not just new material but old material, using successive editions to extend lineage history both forward and backward in time. In some instances these backward accretions were made on the basis of new research by family members; in other instances they involved the transformation of legend into history. The goal was always the same: to claim descent from north China immigrants. Such a claim was strongly desired because the indigenous inhabitants, the Dan g and She # peoples, were deeply despised. The pursuit of this goal encouraged additional untruths. Genealogy writers touted the importance of surname fidelity, although it was widely ignored in two situations?uxorilocal marriage and cross-surname adoption, both designed to ensure the existence of a male heir. Because these practices, though frowned upon, were known to exist, they could be invoked?again with insufficient evidence?to tie one's kinship to that of north China immigrants of a different surname. Thus, a branch of a family surnamed Lin could "restore" their surname back to Chen because of an imputed cross-surname adoption (p. 236 n. 41). The systems of military conscription and household registration</page><page sequence="3">494 REVIEWS begun in the early Ming also demanded flexibility from Fuzhou res idents. The military registration system (junhu MF) forced many families to register as soldier families, which required that one male member of the household serve as a soldier?in Fuzhou they were to protect against coastal invasions. This arrangement posed a ques tion: What would happen in subsequent generations? When a sol dier died, would he pass his status (and hence his obligation for mil itary service) to all his sons?a practice that would multiply the obligation? This, according to Szonyi, would have been an unthink able burden (p. 60). However, if the obligation were passed to only one son, how would the government keep track of which son was supposed to fulfill the obligation? The government resolved the problem by prohibiting the division of the household. Whether they lived separately or together, household members were henceforth required to supply a soldier. To deal with this situation, military households interpreted the law flexibly and acted strategically. They divided their households as other families did, but without report ing the division to the state. They then hired a single descendant to fulfill the military service obligation, used lotteries and the pooling of funds to settle on who would serve, or found other ingenious ways to avoid service. Lin Tingxuan (jinshi 1482) used "a not entirely truthful" petition to restore his surname to Lin from Huang, thus denying he was subject to the obligations of a military household (p. 67). For nonmilitary households, developing flexible arrangements was likewise the norm. These ordinary households, which fell under the dominion of the household registration and taxation (lijia M?) system, faced increasing demands over the course of the Ming, as various supplemental taxes were imposed. Households responded by creating contractual arrangements under which the lijia heads paid the taxes and collected reimbursements from kin. These arrangements were sometimes so successful that local officials sought to implement them elsewhere (p. 75). Over the course of the Ming, the lijia households evolved into independent fiscal entities whose members traced their origins to a single registered progenitor. On the whole, such arrangements continued with seemingly little notice from the state, and remained unchanged even by the Single Whip reforms of the late Ming. In the Qing, the state sometimes co-opted these forms of organization, manipulating them to suit its interests.</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 495 Forces other than military service and tax collection motivated kinship organization. Reclaimed alluvial lands (used for agriculture or shellfish cultivation) and commercial enterprises were notori ously difficult to divide among descendants. In the case of the for mer, this was because the land itself constantly shifted, sometimes even disappearing and reappearing downstream. In the case of the latter, households sought to maintain profitable business enterprises intact, rather than attempting a division. In both cases, flexible strategies of kinship organization allowed kin to maintain shared ownership. Szonyi devotes two chapters to the ancestral hall (zongci ^M or citang jflfli?). Most scholars argue that ancestral halls were constructed at the impetus of elites, who sought to use them in an agenda of cultural integration whereby they strengthened their hold over local society. Szonyi, in contrast, demonstrates that they were created for different reasons at different times. From the late Song to the early Ming, ancestral halls were exclusively built by very high-ranking officials in order to mark their special status. In the mid-Ming, lesser elites began to build them, reflecting their growing interest in local society and distaste for commercialism, which they perceived as having a destructive effect on the social order. At about the same time, however, those who had reaped the benefits of commercial ism used their newfound wealth themselves to build ancestral halls. In a discussion of five ancestral halls built over the Ming and Qing, Szonyi traces a general evolution through categories he devises, from "official," to "gentry," to "popular" (p. 97).1 Official halls were exclusivist. They were built by high officials themselves, or by those who had received state permission, to set them apart from the rest of local society. Gentry halls, which were also exclusivist, were cre ated as testaments to social status. In contrast, popular halls were inclusive. Their construction and maintenance were funded by con tributions from all descendants of a founding ancestor, and they aimed to strengthen cohesion among lineage members. The ritual observances practiced in the ancestral halls demon strate the principle of flexibility at work. In theory, ancestral hall 1 Although Szonyi makes it clear that these were ideal forms only, and that they over lapped considerably, it would be useful to have a more systematic presentation of the data on ancestral halls in the Fuzhou region, especially the number studied and the categories into which they fell, for example.</page><page sequence="5">496 REVIEWS practices were supposed to conform to the state-sponsored ortho doxy of Zhu Xi's Family Rituals (Jia li W?i) but in practice they were governed by a variety of subtle forces. Family Rituals was certainly influential, but stated adherence to that work concealed the ways in which rituals as practiced incorporated preexisting local ritual and innovation due to new needs. In particular, the nature of the ritu als practiced had much to do with when, and for what reasons, the halls were built. Official and gentry halls by and large excluded practices that were noncanonical, favoring instead those that con formed to Family Rituals and fostered lineage solidarity. Popular halls, in contrast, condoned noncanonical rituals. One such ritual studied by Szonyi is that of beimang ?W (as pronounced in Fuzhou dialect), which coincided with the lantern festival. In popular halls, this ritual was, and remains today, intermeshed with the fertility rituals of the goddess Chen Jinggu ffei^f?. In gentry and official halls, the lantern festival is celebrated not in conjunction with beimang but with rituals that reinforce the bonds of kinship (p. 136). In his final substantive chapter, Szonyi turns to the local cults of Fuzhou. Here, as elsewhere in the book, the first Ming emperor's presence is strongly felt. Local ritual practice was changed during his reign to ensure that only two cults were worshiped at the local level: the cult of anonymous spirits of soil and grains (sheji ttS) and the cult of hungry ghosts (litan Ait). Elite writers later in the Ming would depict these changes as having once been effective. They crit icized their own time, when extravagant local cults housed in enclosed temples and dedicated to unsanctioned deities pervaded local society. These writers would look back wistfully to a time when local rituals were characterized by elegant simplicity. As Szonyi sug gests, however, it is difficult to determine the extent to which Ming regulations succeeded in uprooting popular religious practices. While it is possible that in some cases officially sanctioned cults fully supplanted indigenous practices, much evidence also suggests that official and indigenous practices were often combined, and that in some locales official cults were never implemented. At times, the language and organization of ritual practices were based on Ming precedents, but the actual performance of a ritual was considerably different. These are more examples of flexibility at work. What is certain is that intervention by the Ming state dramatically changed</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 497 how these local cults portrayed themselves. As Szonyi writes, "Conformity, or claims to conformity, with the norms of the sys tem became a cultural resource that could be deployed in local strug gles and in relations with the state" (p. 173). Through the lijia system the local cult became an intrinsic part of kinship practice. In a process he labels the devolution of the she ft (officially authorized altars), lijia organizations began to build their own altars and temples, and to claim that these were offi cially sanctioned she altars. The process, as Szonyi demonstrates, was not evidence of the deterioration of the Ming system. In fact, lineages strove to establish the pedigree of their she altars, claiming legitimacy by linking them to a prior she altar in the Ming official system. In reality, the she altars as lineages constructed them bore little resemblance to those required by Ming regulations, which called for open earthen altars where sacrifices were to be made. Instead, these so-called she altars were enclosed structures where anthropomorphic deities were worshiped. They remained organi zations that were firmly under the control of lineages that traced their origins to particular lijia households. The central lesson of Practicing Kinship is thus that kinship prac tices were generally not what they were portrayed to be. It is in this thesis that the challenge of the project and ultimate achievement of the book are demonstrated. If Fuzhou people sought to present their practices as conforming to orthodoxy, the historian's task of deter mining what they really did is daunting. As Szonyi describes the issue, "Strategies that involved creating the appearance of confor mity to orthodoxy necessarily conceal their own effects" (pp. 204-5). In the case of genealogies, for example, their compilers "did the utmost to cover their tracks, to present seamless narratives of descent that were not even open to doubt" (p. 53). Szonyi does a superb job of understanding and piercing through the rhetoric of conformity. He assembles considerable evidence from a wide range of sources collected from local archives, libraries, and "m situ"?in one case from the decaying loft of an ancestral hall (pp. 21, 232 n.53). These sources, which include texts he obtained from Fuzhou people, genealogies, inscriptions, gazetteers, and scholarly writings, were supplemented with careful fieldwork in the Fuzhou area. Observations of how residents now practice kinship and</page><page sequence="7">498 REVIEWS discussions with Fuzhou people allow him to see beyond the appear ance of conformity presented in texts. Using evidence from the pre sent to study the past is dangerous, as Szonyi is aware. But his judi cious use of the technique brings ample rewards. It was observing contemporary worship of Chen Jinggu, for example, that led him to insights about the connection between when halls were con structed and which rituals were practiced in them (p. 154). Two other textual sources of information were important to Szonyi's study. The first was contemporary recorded observations made by longtime Fuzhou resident and missionary Justus Doolittle.2 As outsiders, Westerners were ignorant of the requirements of ortho doxy, and therefore felt no compulsion to overlook unorthodoxy in their writings. Doolittle, for example, describes the practice of uxo rilocal marriage more bluntly than Chinese sources tend to (p. 38). His observations are at points so revealing that they left this reader wondering whether Szonyi might have found useful information in other writings by Western missionaries who were based in the Fuzhou region.3 The other important textual source was "jottings literature" (biji wen), including the observations found in the remark ably candid Ming biji, Wu za zu SUffl, written by Xie Zhaozhe 8? MM- In a world dominated by strict rules as to what could and could not be written in particular genres of texts, what I have elsewhere termed "acceptable discourse," Wu za zu stands out for its direct ness and honesty?even by the standards of biji. Other sources Szonyi uses are far less direct than these, requir ing that he decode the rhetoric to uncover what was really done. He shows that many stock phrases were used to conceal behavior that would not have been considered orthodox. For example, he convincingly demonstrates that, when the editors of genealogies described a male ancestor as moving into the area because he had admired the quality of its geomancy or landscape, it meant that his real motivation was a uxorilocal marriage (p. 36).

While Szonyi generally does an outstanding job seeing beyond the rhetoric of stock phrases, at several points he appears to suc cumb to them. In describing the lijia system in the early Ming, for example, he takes literally an author's statement that "local customs were virtuous and the people encouraged honesty and humility" (p. 74). Statements like this, even when supported by other evidence, were themselves formulaic. Writers used such prescribed statements to lament the current decrepitude of ritual observance. Szonyi gives too much credence to other formulaic statements, such as the "ancient ways esteemed simplicity" (p. 98) or "the rites have not been neglected in the least" (p. 144). Because it is difficult to read beyond such pronouncements, the early Ming baseline Szonyi cre ates is not entirely persuasive. How do we know that statements about the observance of orthodox rules in the early Ming can be taken as factual? Szonyi himself acknowledges the possibility that they cannot (p. 178). Indeed, it is difficult to know how literally any claim of adher ence to orthodoxy should be taken, even when the claim appears to be an unequivocal statement of fact. Consider an admittedly extreme example, the following statement Szonyi quotes from an epitaph: "He followed the Family Rituals [when arranging his father's funeral] and did not deign to invite Buddhists [to chant sutras]" (p. 143). How do we know that such statements were taken literally by the people who read them and were not simply formulaic statements considered appropriate to the epitaph genre?4 It is the focus on local history that ultimately makes the analysis in Practicing Kinship so convincing. While some historians may shy away from local history, arguing that it can tell us nothing of inter est wider than the locality described, Szonyi's book proves other wise. By examining one place in China, Szonyi is able to explain how local kinship practice related to the larger worlds of orthodoxy and the state. His analysis, for example, of the subtle ways in which 4 One way of knowing how seriously declarations of orthodoxy were taken is to look for evidence of conflict?for example, instances where one writer criticized another for failing to adhere to an orthodox standard. Practicing Kinship provides little evidence of such conflict.</page><page sequence="9">500 REVIEWS the popular cults of the Fuzhou region related to state-sponsored orthodoxy is extraordinarily revealing. He also demonstrates how the mandates of Family Rituals were understood and negotiated at the local level. This is an invaluable contribution to our under standing of that text, and an important supplement to the work of Kai-wing Chow and Patricia Ebrey, both of whom have studied the significance o? Family Rituals from a wider perspective.5 Their work shows the text was pervasive, but some late imperial sources sug gest it was often owned more than it was practiced. Xie Zhaozhe had noted that while many Fuzhou residents owned the work and some even used it, most people laughed at them for doing so.6 And the seventeenth-century scholar Yan Yuan Mit observed that, when he tried to follow the text's prescriptions carefully while in mourn ing, doing so left him at the point of starvation.7 But these are the comments of individuals. Szonyi's work shows us how the text func tioned in the lineage?which was after all the group for which it mattered most. In reaching the conclusion that lineage practice was based on a strategic and flexible use of orthodox values to which adherence was professed, Szonyi addresses a question first posed by James Watson and Evelyn Rawski in the conference volume they edited on death ritual: Was the state most concerned with enforcing orthopraxy (cor rect practice) or orthodoxy (correct belief)?8 Szonyi looks at the ques tion less in terms of what the state required than in terms of how individuals and lineages responded to those requirements. In doing so, he makes sense of the disjuncture between what we know about local practices and what appears in elite writings and philosophical texts. Szonyi shows individuals professing to adhere to orthodoxy while 5 Patricia Buckley Ebrey, Confucianism and Family Rituals in China: A Social History of Writing about Rites (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991); Kai-wing Chow, The Rise of Confucian Ritualism in Late Imperial China: Ethics, Classics, and Lineage Discourse (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994). 6 Xie Zhaozhe ??H3?J, Wu za zu S?t^?, Biji xiaoshuo daguan edition (Taibei: Xin xing shuju, 1979), 14.4346. 7 Yan Yuan, "Ju you yu jian" JgiSf^JiL (1664), in Xizhaijiyu HHffBi&amp;, Jifu congshu edi tion (Dingzhou, 1879), 10.10a. 8 James L.

When viewed from the perspective of the state's interest, this finding is especially impor tant. In Practicing Kinship, the state's adoption of Family Rituals as orthodoxy marked its intervention in the ritual life of its people. That is, Szonyi depicts the state as deliberately driving a process to determine what ordinary people were required to do, and as gen uinely committed to that orthodoxy. Here it is worth asking a ques tion somewhat outside the scope of Szonyi's inquiry, namely, whether the state was driving the process, or whether it was also merely professing orthodoxy. My own research suggests that, for the early Ming, the commitment on the state's part was real, but, for the Qing, state actors, and even the emperor himself, were no different from ordinary people.9 The state, like its people, was "str?tegizing in the language of orthodoxy" (p. 205). Recognition of this dynamic might have allowed Szonyi to add nuance to his presentation of the state's role. Instead, he goes only so far as to describe the state's presence as "partial or incomplete," arguing that "organized kinship developed in the Fuzhou region in the interstices of this partial state presence" (p. 201). Concentrating on the practice of kinship, Szonyi does not discuss the issue of what people actually believed, nor should he. If the prob lem of trust can be daunting for pronouncements about practice, it is much more so for pronouncements about belief. But it was for this reader, at least, a nagging question. In a situation Confucius himself might have lamented, the practice of ancestor worship seems to have had little to do with worshiping or even respecting the ances tors. It was more concerned with the building of community, and, paradoxically, with competition among the descendants for status (p. 164). In the world of ancestor worship in Fuzhou, everyone pro fessed allegiance to an orthodoxy but strategized to meet other needs. At several points Szonyi's book offers hints that ancestors may have meant more to some people than community and com petition. One man who worked to restore his family's ancestral hall commented that after it was completed he could feel "that the spir its were present" (p. 133). But another writer took a different stance, 9 Norman Kutcher, Mourning in Late Imperial China: Filial Piety and the State (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999).</page><page sequence="11">502 REVIEWS differentiating the building of the ancestral hall from the worship of ancestors. The haul, he said, benefited not the ancestors but the descendants, providing them with a place to "elegantly gather at the time of the festivals" (p. 158). Are these statements themselves merely clich?s? Answering this question would require additional exami nation of the written record. A final question emerges from the conclusion o? Practicing Kinship: Should professed orthodoxy as an analytical formula be limited to Confucian orthodoxy? Underlying Szonyi's book is the assumption that while the residents of Fuzhou professed Confucian orthodoxy, they more deeply and genuinely believed in other competing sys tems. Might other belief systems, such as Buddhism, have pre sented their own orthodoxies, which were also more professed than believed? And might even worship of Chen Jinggu have been a pro fessed orthodoxy? Looking beyond Fuzhou and forward in history, one might ask whether the paradigm of "strategizing in the language of orthodoxy" applies to other orthodoxies, such as Marxism Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. Though a local study, Practicing Kinship thus raises questions of remarkably interesting breadth.</page></plain_text>
