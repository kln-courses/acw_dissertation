Such false yet pervasive imagery suggests the erroneous scheme that "primi- tive art" adheres in the first, "tourist art" char- acterizes the second, and no art should exist in the third. Serious South American ethnography, however, yields evidence that the Peruvian people in and around Iquitos and southwest up the Ucayali River to Pucallpa speak Span- ish (a dialect sometimes called Charapa, "water turtle") in their quotidian lives, and turn when illness strikes to male shamans who take ayahuasca (soul vine, Banisteriopsis caapi combined with another hallucinogenic sub- stance). During ayahuasca trips into and out of the spirit world the shamans chant in a creole Quechua featuring relexified Tupian. In turn, much of the imagery revealed in such shamanic diagnosis and treatment of illness permeates Jivaroan, Tupian, and Lowland Quechua mythopoetics, as well as the cultural themes of many other Amazonian and An- dean people. To understand Upper Amazonian culture and thought, one should master something of the conjoined ethnography and history of Jivaroan, Amazonian Quechua, and Ama- zonian Mestizo imagery, and combine this montage with the Tucanoan, Tupian, Za- paroan, Tukuna, Shipibo, and Andean Quechua systems of thought. This book would be an excellent starting point for such an endeavor, even though the art that it fea- tures emerged recently. Colombian Luis Eduardo Luna is a profes- sional anthropologist specializing in Ama- zonia who resides in Helsinki, Finland. Pablo Cesar Amaringo is a Peruvian who learned shamanic arts in Amazonia, later became a painter, and founded the USKO-AYAR Ama- zonian School of Painting in Pucallpa. Both of the authors have deep and telling histories of learning the ways of Amazonian thought and culture in Colombia and Peru. The fore- runner to this book is Luna's Vegetalismo: Sha- manism among the Mestizo Population of the Peruvian Amazon (Almqvist and Wiksell Inter- national, 1986), which clearly established the efficacy of the shamanic complex in this re- gion and is unfortunately now out of print. The work under review conjoins the deep, ancient inner imagery of the practicing in- digenous shaman and the modern nonindi- genous art world emerging in Amazonian Peru. The former is centered on well-known shamanic practices and insight-producing quasi-trances that permeate the indigenous traditions of Upper Amazonia. The latter is decentered around European fairies, African demons, Hindu goddesses, Andean Incas, spaceships, and other artistic embodiments of modern Amazonia. The book opens with an introduction that describes the learning experiences of the authors. Since Luna knew of paintings by Tucano seers produced at the behest of Co- lombian ethnographer Gerardo Reichel- Dolmatoff, he asked Amaringo to paint some of his previous visions. The learning process of becoming an artist is described by Amaringo, to complement the description by Luna. A very succinct and balanced historical discussion of the scientific and humanistic literature on ethnography and use of hallu- cinogens in Upper Amazonia closes this sec- tion. Amaringo's biography is presented and followed by general comments on visions of people who enter the spirit world induced by the ingestion of ayahuasca. Shamans are called vegetalistas, meaning that their powers derive from those natural spiritual forces of the tropical rain forest gen- erally, and specifically from every single "liv- ing" (including inanimate) thing of the forest, from its undersoil, nursing waters, and prolific vegetation and insect life, to its mois- ture-laden air. The vegetalista must master the icaro (power song) and the use of yachay, yausa, or marin/ (which I translate as "numi- nous phlegm"). "The icaros and the phlegm- both of which have material and immaterial qualities-represent a transference of the spirits of each plant, with all their knowledge and theriomorphic and anthropomorphic manifestations, into the body of the shaman" (p. 13). Luna focuses on the visions that Amaringo calls upon to produce his shamanic art, grouping them as follows: ayahuasca sessions; plant spirits; spaceships; fairies, mermaids, and dolphins; cities; and snakes. Music itself is critical to vegetalista performance, and one of Amaringo's power songs is given in Quechua with English translation. The trans- lation suffers because of an intervening Span- ish version, and though readers may get the sense of the original, we lose the power of the organization of concepts and images in the original Quechua rendition.</page><page sequence="3">492 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [95,1993] Forty-nine paintings by Amaringo are then beautifully reproduced in full color with a running commentary by the artist. Luna pro- vides scientific names to everything included in the artist's own description. My preference was to study the art, appreciate it, think about it in terms of knowledge and visions of the region and its cultures. Only then did I return to read with care the artist's own description. After reading the description it was necessary again to return to Luna's use of his delineated themes. The aesthetic forces of this new, emergent style of Amazonian painting conjoin ancient indigenous traditions of shamanic imagery with cosmopolitan mythopoetics. This is aes- thetic cosmography at its best, for its very quintessence is imbued with transformation.</page></plain_text>
