Liz Ryan. Liberties Press. 313 pp €14.99 pb 21 cm +1-907593-13-0. Ryan is a freelance writer and novelist with seven titles to her name. She moved to France in 2001, finding Ireland at the height of the Celtic tiger just too stressful and unattractive. She spins a good yarn about her problems settling in in France, her encounters with the infamous French bureaucracy and getting used to a new way of life. It is all well told and amusing although there is a serious story underneath it all. Liberties Press have a website where readers can vote on whether they think Ryan should stay in France or come home, and there is also a competition sponsored by Irish Ferries to win a trip to France. ♦+ - * / Rosie's War : an Englishwoman's escape from occupied France. Rosemary Say and Noel Holland. Michael O'Mara Books. 256 pp + 16 of photos ¿17.99 hb 23 cm +1-84317-557-5. This highlights a neglected aspect of the second world war: what happened to British civilians when the Germans occupied France. Rosemary Say, born 1919, was a successful journalist after the war, and then settled in Ireland. She tells the story of her life in France before the war and what happened when Germany invaded. She was interned in a detention camp in Besançon, escaped and with the help of many French people eventually made it back to England. This is an honest, straightforward account of those times, both harrowing and thrilling. Say does well in describing the situations she found herself in and the people she encountered, such as her fellow communist escapee. She died in 1996, and this book was brought to press by her elder daughter and son in law. I « - * y llI'HT.lJiH Fear Not the Storm : the story of Tom Cullen, an Irish revolutionary. Cathal Liam. St Pádraic Press, www.cathalliam.com. 308 pp €12 $16 pb 23 cm. +0 9704-1553-0. This is a stirring account of one of the minor but key figures in the war of independence. Cullen was a committed republican from an early age and participated in the 1916 rising. On his release from internment he continued to be active in the independence movement and rose to become a valued lieutenant of Michael Collins. Liam follows the career of Cullen from its early days to his involvement in the intelligence war against the British in Dublin.

Written by an Irish-American, this biography is different in style from an Irish written biography with parts which read like fiction and many personal interventions by the author conveying his views and emotions, but it's a good read for all that.

The story of Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty has already been well told. First in the Gregory Peck film about him and then more seriously in Brian Fleming's The Vatican Pimpernel (Collins Press, 2008). Indeed Harper Collins carefully muddy the waters by dropping the Harper element of their name. This book owes more to the film in the sense that it is a somewhat sensationalist treatment of O'Flaherty's story. It is marketed as if it were the first biography of him, and the Irish media have duly obliged in its reviews and interviews. Walker isa BBC journalist but this is hardly written in a BBC style as he approaches the story like a political thriller. It is enjoyable nevertheless and does tell O'Flaherty's story from cradle to grave with the main emphasis on his wartime exploits and subsequent relationship with Kappler, the Nazi commander in</page><page sequence="2">Irish Books in Print The Irish Book Database Thousands of Books Hundreds of Publishers One Website www.rapidmultimedia.com Rome, after he was convicted for war crimes. I Unlikely Rebels : the Gifford girls and the fight for Irish freedom. Anne Clare. Mercier Press. 319 pp + 8 of photos €16.99 pb 21 cm +1-85635-712-8. Shirley Kelly interviewed the author in the March issue. Lives of the six sisters, two of whom were married to signatories of the proclamation of the Republic, Grace famously having married Joseph Plunkett in prison on the eve of his execution. Muriel was the mother of Thomas MacDonagh's two children, and two of the others were imprisoned for their republican activities. The cover consists of an attractive portrait of a girl or young woman, but there is no caption or acknowledgment for it, and somehow it raises our suspicions as perhaps a period pastiche. * ··■ * * j C4ÌMUÌJ Going Forward Looking Back : reflections on two decades of Irish charity work in central and eastern Europe, ed. Frances Howarth. Eastern Europe Aid &amp; Development Network, Ashfield House, Derry Road.Durrow, Co. Laois. €10180 pp pb 23 cm +0-9567856-0-2. With one or two high-profile exceptions the public tends to associate Irish charity work overseas with the developing world, but since the fall of communism many Irish charities and workers have been active in countries of the former soviet bloc. All of these countries have experienced poverty and social problems of one kind or another in recent decades. Using interviews with the people involved on the ground, this book gives us a personal and telling insight into the kind of problems these societies face and what Irish charities are doing in Belarus, Romania, Georgia, Albania and other countries. ++.»*✓ m Corporate Fraud. Andrew Brown. Chartered Accountants of Ireland. 207 pp pb 23 cm +1-907214 22-6. Not a guide to getting away with it but rather a serious examination of how big a problem corporate fraud is and what can be done to prevent it. Brown is an accountant with a huge amount of experience of dealing with fraud, theft, accounting misstatement and money laundering, so he writes with authority in detailing what corporate fraud is, the methods of carrying it out and what can be done about it. The final section of the book deals with investigating fraud, gathering evidence and deciding how to deal with it, in other words setting up procedures to stop it recurring. Even in the good times, fraud of this kind could not be tolerated but in straitened economic circumstances, it is all the more important to guard against it. I ·*+ r * «'hi'lH New Vocabularies, Old Ideas : culture, Irishness and the advertising industry. Neil O'Boyle. Peter Lang. 232 pp €37.80 pb 22 cm +3-03911 978-3. In volume 22 in the 'Reimagining Ireland' series, O'Boyle uses advertising as a means of measuring cultural change. Given globalisation and recent immigration into Ireland we might expect that ideas and images about Irishness will have changed. On the contrary, he concludes that the old ideas and images prevail. It is not so simple as that as he shows how the language used, the styles and even the media have changed giving the appearance of a new approach to Irish identity. However underlying this, he claims, the traditional and conventional images familiar the world over continue to be the norm when it comes to Ireland and Irishness. Β I / * / gzxed "Buffoonery and Easy Sentiment" : popular Irish plays in the decade prior to the opening of the Abbey Theatre. Christopher Fitz-Simon. Carysfort Press. 302 pp pb 23 cm. +1-904505-49-5. The significance of the establishment of the Abbey as the world's first national theatre was that it produced plays which promoted an image of Ireland roughly in line with the independence movement and set a standard for Irish playwrights since. Before that, plays written or produced in Ireland promoted competing or varied views of Irishness in line with different expectations ranging from pleasing the Dublin crowds to conforming with British stereotypes. As this informative and lively books shows they were not all 'buffoonery or easy sentiment'. Fitz-Simon divides the plays of this decade into different categories such as the patriotic, those about Irish heroes, plays reflecting British norms, and even those which deserve mention on the basis of literary merit. He shows us that Irish theatre was diverse and varied in the decades leading up to independence. Β I *♦·./* emun Buteyko Meets Dr Mew. Patrick McKeown. ButeykoClinic.com. 178 pp €12.99 pb 18 cm +0 9566823-0-7. Anyone who watches a lot of American TV shows will be familiar with 'mouth breather' as an insult but this book takes mouth breathing very seriously and argues that it can lead to asthma, facial malformation, ADHD and various other maladies. This book explains that the Buteyko method of breathing was developed in the 1950s by a Russian doctor of that name and introduced to the UK by Dr John Mew in the igôos.The book is a mishmash of styles as there is a 20-page strip cartoon conveying the message for teenagers, and at the other end of the book a colour-illustrated story for young children that uses a passing wizard to get the message across about how kids should breathe and why. Between these custom-made propaganda are pages for parents illustrating how children's faces grow better looking if they don't over-breathe through their mouths. A lot of money and expert work has gone into this compact booklet, but exactly who will spend € 12.99 to be indoctrinated is we'd think a matter of doubt. * / * ✓ Gram» British Spies and Irish Rebels : British intelligence and Ireland 1916-1945. Paul McMahon. Boydell Press. 519 pp +12 of photos £19.99 $34 pb23 cm +1-84383-656-8. The importance of intelligence in the war of independence has long been recognised and covered by other historians but this book is significant not just for telling the story from the British perspective but also for looking at the activities of British intelligence over a longer period. Using recently released archives, McMahon writes a detailed and in-depth study of British military and other intelligence operations in Ireland from 1916 to the end of the second world war and of the rebels against whom their activities were directed. The section on neutral Ireland is particularly enlightening as it is often overlooked by historians and contains an interesting cast of characters including John Betjeman and Elizabeth Bowen who in their own ways provided intelligence to the British. Β I / * / Ireland 1815-1870 : emancipation, famine and religion, ed. Donnchadh Ó Corráin and Tomás O'Riordan. Four Courts Press. 278 pp + 24 of photos pb 23 cm +1-84682-232-2. This is the first in a new series on modern Irish history. Despite its title, however, it is not an attempt to write a 'grand narrative' of Irish history as each volume has a number of contributors while themes or movements in any given era are the main topics explored. Although ostensibly aimed at a wide readership it has the appearance and format of a text book and the contributors are academics. Students will find numbered bite-sized paragraphs summarising a particular event, organisation or individual along with handy quotations and tables. Just the thing for writing an essay or preparing for an exam. I * / * The Last Irish Plague : the great flu epidemic in Ireland 1918-19. Caitriona Foley. Irish Academic Press. 260 pp €19.95 pb 23 cm +0-7165-3116-6. The flu epidemic that followed the first world war was not just an Irish but a global phenomenon. It affected 100 million victims worldwide and in Ireland around 20,000 died. Despite being the worst natural disaster since the great famine of the 1840s the epidemic seems to have been largely forgotten about by the public and little studied by historians, so Foley's book is welcome. It gives a blow-by-blow account of the course of the disease examining the various aspects of it such as how it spread across the country, the medical response to the outbreak and its social impact. This would appear to be based on Foley's PhD thesis and does display some of the clunkiness associated with that kind of writing. Nevertheless it is an informed and informative account of a catastrophic event in modern Irish history. ΒI ♦ / * j Riotous Assemblies : rebels, riots and revolts in Ireland, ed. William Sheehan and Maura Cronin. Mercier Press. 320 pp €19.99 pb2icm +1-85635-653-4. Ireland is no stranger to riotous assemblies of one kind or another and this book examines some manifestations of these from the 16th to the 20th century. Topics covered include riots at elections in 1613, poor law disturbances and Limerick republicans 1917-18 among many others. There is no explanation for the reasoning behind this book or the selection of topics. They are an eclectic mix are widespread both chronologically and geographically, and it is arguable that they are not all part of the same phenomenon. Do the tithe riots of the 1830s, for example, really have much in common with the Northern Ireland riots in 1969? ♦ / * j Science and Technology in Nineteenth century Ireland, ed. Juliana Adelman and Éadaoin Agnew. Four Courts Press. 180 pp €55 hb 23 cm +1 84682-291-9. Only recently, it appeasr, have science, technology and industry received the recognition they deserve in Irish history although in the popular imagination Ireland in the past is still perceived as a mainly rural low-tech society. The thirteen contributors to this book look at different aspects of science and technology in the nineteenth century under the headings of innovations, individuals and institutions. They show not only that science and technology were at the centre of development in Ireland but that Irish scientists and engineers often led the way internationally in these fields. As well as this they also discuss their place in the wider cultural and social milieu. I + / * / Turning Points in Twentieth-century Irish History, ed. Thomas E. Hachey. Irish Academic Press. 256 pp €21.95 pb 23 cm +0-7165-3122-7.

Nevertheless there is something to be said for examining key moments in history and the contributors here select some of the more memorable events in recent history like the 1916 rising or John F. Kennedy's visit. However the truth is that they are more at ease in discussing concepts like women's rights, the secularisation of society or the origins of the peace process. The book does have a fragmented feel to it and the reader does not leave it with a sense of the course of 20th century history that the title implies. I * / * / Ulster Liberalism 1778-1876 Gerald R. Hall. Four Courts Press. 272 pp hb 23 cm +1-84682-202-5. The liberal tradition in Ulster is now almost forgotten and generally viewed asa victim of the extremism which entered politics with the late 19th-century home rule crises. As Hall argues, at one time it was a potent force in the province's politics and acted as a progressive counterweight to the conservative landed interest. He traces its origins to the volunteer movement of the 1770s and follows its progress against the background of the battle for Catholic emancipation, the growth of public opinion and the political influences of the churches. He explains how the liberal movement was squeezed out by the change in politics but argues that it is a mistake to underestimate its influence or achievements. Β I ♦ / * Donegal and the Civil War : the untold story. Liam Ó Duibhir. Mercier Press. 284 pp + 8 of photos €19.99 pb2i cm +1-85635-720-3. It was inevitable that the revival of scholarship on the war of independence would lead to renewed study of the civil war which followed. Ó Duibhir leads the way with his book on Donegal, a follow-up to his account of the county in the war of independence, Donegal Awakening. The fighting in Donegal between pro and anti treaty forces took on a character of its own since it was an Ulster county and partition played its part. As elsewhere the picture was a complicated one and the fighting bitter. Ó Duibhir chronicles the course of the war, concentrating on the nature of the conflict, key events and the important individuals involved. The rare photographs add an extra dimension to this book, particularly those of the IRA which dominated many parts of the county. Β I * &gt; * / A Millstreet Miscellany (5). ed. Jack Lane. Aubane Historical Society. 47 pp €15 pb 30 cm +1 903497-66-1. The Aubane Historical Society carries on with its publications devoted to the Cork town of Millstreet. This brochure harks back to the early days of desktop publishing and the price is perhaps nearly justified by the colour reproduction of the 1825 map in the centrefold. Single-column text on an A4 page does not make for comfortable reading. But typography aside, it is a good example of how the closer one looks the more one finds as the essays show that even in one locality there are many histories. Topics covered include O'Connell's repeal campaign in the locality, the 1825 Beauford map of Cork, visitors' impressions of Millstreet and much more. The reproduction of original documents and maps provide the illustrations. ♦♦ / * CEEEXED Dublin Wit. Des McHale. Mercier Press. 95 pp €9.99 hb 18 cm +1-85635-713-5. Dubliners are famous for their wit, or so they like to think, and Mayo man McHale has collected anecdotes, jokes and remarks made by or about Dubliners. This is the latest in his series of books on jokes about or from the different counties of Ireland. The book has thematic chapters such as culchie jokes and football jokes but most of it is dedicated to great wits associated with the city from Jonathan Swift and Oscar Wilde to Samuel Beckett and Dave Allen. As Wilde might have said, you would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at the jokes and sayings collected here. + j * / Now that's What I Call A Big Feckin' Irish Book. Colin Murphy and Donai O'Dea. O'Brien Press. 288 pp hb 19 cm +1-84717-251-8. This is the fifteenth in the O'Brien 'feckin' series. Other titles have included The Feckin' Book of Bankers, of Irish Sayings and so on. This one may be regarded as the apogee of the series or conceivably the nadir. It is the kind of book that you either love or loathe. It is either an example of a publisher pandering to racist stereotypes of the Irish or proof that we can laugh at ourselves. It's all a matter of taste. There are some genuinely funny things in it and even some useful information on history, sayings, surnames and other topics, even if the tone is irreverent and rude. ♦+ ν Anne Enright. ed. Claire Bracken and Susan Cahill. Irish Academic Press. 256 pp €22.95 pb 23 cm +0 7165-3081-7. This is the eighth volume in Irish Academic Press's 'Visions and Revisions' series about Irish writers in their time. Enright has the distinction of being the first living writer included in the series and that seems to be on the strength of her novel The Gathering winning the Man Booker prize in 2007. The volume includes an interview with the novelist conducted in 2009 and essays by different academics on various aspects of her work such as her short fiction, sexuality, identity, her place in the Irish tradition and so on. Β I * « r * / Beyond Ireland : encounters across culture, ed. Hedda Friberg-Harnesk et al. Peter Lang. 341 pp €47.80 pb 22 cm +3-0343-0270-8. Peter Lang continues to reimagine Ireland, ever eager to give the country a makeover and move away from the conventional and prevailing interpretations of Irish culture. Here Scandinavian-based academics seek to move beyond the island of Ireland and away from the indigenous culture to find in the work of Irish writers signs that they wish to escape insularity. They range from the Japanese influence on Irish poetry to discussing Engelsand the international significance of Irish history. If nothing else it is an interesting showing of how others see us. I &gt; * j Breaking the Mould : literary representations of Irish Catholicism, ed. Eamon Maherand Eugene O'Brien. Peter Lang. 249 pp €40 pb 22 cm +3-0343 0232-06. This is volume 36 in the Reimagining Ireland series. The twelve contributors work in or are graduates of universities on both sides of the Atlantic. This results in considerations of Irish American factors as well as a discussion of the more positive aspects of the church's influence than might have been expected from natives. There is also examination of negative influences which are pretty well rehearsed by now in both popular and academic literature. The essays examine the works of Joyce, Heaney, Kate O'Brien, Friel and others to show how the Catholic church has influenced their writing and is represented in it. I *■&gt; / * / cmD Republicanism in Transition (1) : the need for debate, ed. Michael Hall. Island Pamphlets. 36 pp pb 21 cm +1-8995-89-4. Island Pamphlets continues in its work of facilitating discussion at grass roots level about the way forward in the North. The peace process has probably provided as many problems for republicans as it solved and the way forward for the movement, notwithstanding Sinn Féin's recent success in the general election, is still up for debate. This pamphlet provides a platform for different republican groups such as Sinn Féin, Republican Sinn Féin, the IRSPand so on to state their positions and outline their vision of the future. Given that many of these groups are sworn enemies who will not talk to each other, bringing them together is a valuable contribution to debate and discussion in the North. ++ / * GEEZXD Bending the Boyne. J. S. Dunn. Seriously Good Books, seriouslygoodbks@aol.com. 347 pp $17,99 pb 23 cm +0-9831554-1-6. Dunn is a lawyer in the United States who has spent much time in Ireland researching and writing this novel. It is cross between genres, being based on archaeology, history and myth to which Dunn has added his own imagination to create characters and a plot. Centred round Cian and his lover Boann, it takes up the twin themes of the ancient invasions of Ireland and the transition from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age. The plot takes Cian far from Ireland to Spain and beyond as he learns about metalwork and hopes to save his people from the invading Celts. This is an imaginative and largely credible invention of the ancient world and the possible workings out of the transition from one civilisation to another. / * / The Hard Life. Flann O'Brien. Souvenir Press. 157 pp £10 pb 20 cm +0-28563-895-2. Comedy was the forte of Brian O'Nolan, alias Flann O'Brien, who is regularly mentioned in the same breath as Joyce and Beckett, with his wit beating theirs. He often he used comedy to tell a dark or even a sad story. This novel appeared in 1961 when at last O'Nolan was getting some critical attention and sales. It tells the story of two brothers Finbarr and Manus growing up in Dublin at the turn of the twentieth century. The plot is absurd and culminates in an unlikely pilgrimage to Rome but it constitutes a biting satire of the educational system and the Church: themes just as or more - relevant today, when perhaps a new readership will rediscover his intelligence and rather dated 'misery lit' in this "exegesis of squalor". Souvenir give it an extremelyattractive cover (a likeable group of ragamuffins), but inside are satisfied to provide a squodgy facsimile of the text of an older edition, maybe the first. &lt; &gt; * / Homecoming. Cathy Kelly. Harper. 446 pp €7.99 pb 20 cm +0-00-724046-3. Kelly is one of the most popular women writers in Ireland and her novels have a worldwide following. This is twelfth one and was originally published in 2010, now reappearing in (cheaper) paperback. It is a charming story about how much Ireland has changed in recent decades. We get the chance to see this though the eyes of Eleanor Levine who left Ireland with just a suitcase seventy years before. Now she has returned as a successful psychologist who moves into Golden Square. She has with her her mother's recipe book which also serves as a guide to Ireland in the 1920s. From her window Eleanor watches her neighbours go about their lives but things are not quite as they seem as she soon discovers. - * / The Penance Room. Carol Coffey. Poolbeg Press. 381 pp €9.99 pb 19 cm +1-84223-452-5. Coffey's background is in special needs education and she once worked as the house manager in a home for autistic children. Her experiences working in a nursing home in Australia, where this novel is set, also influenced her writing of this story. There she</page><page sequence="4">noticed that people often ended up sharing accommodation with others from countries with which they had been at war at one time or another, in other words with an enemy. The resulting tensions, particularly between older people, are the subject of this story, and they are highlighted by contrast with the unspoiled idealism of a thirteen year-old boy-and perhaps defused by him too. Thus this is a story with a moral message, as was, we think, Coffey's previous novel, The Butterfly State. * The Soldier's Return. Alan Monaghan. Macmillan. 331 pp €14.99 £12.99 Can$i8.99 pb 23 cm. +0-230-74089-51 This is the follow-up to Monaghan's The Soldier's Song about the experiences of Irishman Stephen Ryan in the first world war. After three years at the front Ryan returns to a very different Dublin. Sinn Féin is in the ascendant, the war unpopular and there is widespread fear of conscription. Ryan does not know where his loyalties lie even though his brother is with Sinn Féin. Addicted to the morphine given to treat his wounds and finding that the woman he loves has changed too, he seeks solace in returning to France and the war. However things are not straightforward or predictable in this thought provoking novel which brings a new slant to this period of recent history. * y The Things We Do for Love. Roisin Meaney. Hachette. 399 pp £12.99 pb 23 cm +1-4447-0679-6. Summer cannot be far away when this type of book starts to appear-the kind you buy to read on a long plane journey or on the beach. Kerry-born Meaney travelled extensively in North America, Africa and Europe before returning to live in Limerick and becoming a writer. This is her seventh novel and the title indicates to which genre it belongs. The usual elements of secrets kept and secrets revealed, unrequited love, betrayal and eventual happiness are given a different twist in being set in a life drawing class. There three friends and the people they encounter find out about life and love and the true meaning of happiness. Just the right mixture of sentiment, intrigue and love for holiday reading. - * y To Speak the Unspoken. Fergal Nally. Trafford Publishing. 259 pp €20 pb23 cm +1-4269-2121-6. Nally, born 1935, is a medical doctor retired after a very distinguished career. This is the third novel of a trilogy in which Dr John Nicholson takes on a big pharmacautical company which is trying to prevent him finding a cure for cancer. Things come to a head in this volume when he is accused of causing the death of a patient by administering an unlicensed drug. It is not unusual for retired professional people, particularly with expert knowledge that they could use as an ingredient, to take up novel writing, not realising that something more than intelligence and literacy are needed. However this is not the case with Nally, who knows what readers want and to a great extent how to provide it. So it's a pity that he has had to resort to self-publishing via Trafford, who like most such organisations are good at promoting their services but not nearly so good at selling books. This novel is available from the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland alumni office, whose library redevelopment fund gets all the proceeds. ■ / * Too Close for Comfort. Clare Dowling. Headline Review. 313 pp£12.99 pb 23 cm +0-7553-5975-2. The seventh novel from Dowling is another bittersweet comedy about women in the modern world. It centres around two sisters whose lives collide again after years apart. Ali flees with her two children from a broken marriage in America to seek refuge with her sister, Emma. However it is the last thing that Emma wants, as she has problems of her own. The two sisters are at odds with each other and events don't help. Can Ali and the children fit in? Will Emma be able to share her problems with Ali? And when she does can Ali help? In the end the sisters rediscover that family is important and that a sister is someone who will be there for you when no one else is.

Salmon Poetry. 71 pp €12 pb 21 cm +1-907056-58-1. Salmon Poetry continues to introduce Irish readers to American poets in its 30th anniversary year. Peterson is an award-winning poet and artist who divides his time between Florida and Oregon. He has already published a number of collections and this one draws on themes from those earlier works. He observes and is influenced by nature but he also includes science, history and of course art in his verse. The artistic eye comes to the fore in many of the images he conjures. The title poem explores ideas of memory, landscape and recording, setting the tone for many of the poems that follow. + . / * y Early / Late : new and selected poems. Philip Fried. Salmon Poetry. 161 pp €12 pb 21 cm +1-907056 57-4. This collection draws on Fried's earlier four collections along with some new poems. He is based in New York and has already been extensively published in American journals and anthologies. The poems are organised into sections beginning with the latest poems and those from other collections in reverse chronological order. In a sense this makes reading them something like an archaeological dig as you begin with the top layer and work your way back in time uncovering evidence of Fried's evolution as a poet and recognising common themes. * ■· &gt; * y From Bone to Blossom.

Presumably on account of that it was supported by funding from * South Dublin and Offaly County Councils. It is the second collaborative effort between poet Casey and illustrating artist Emma Barone. Their last was the 2008 publication Reading Hieroglyphs in Unexpected Places.

However beneath all the humour are some astute observations about people and the world around her which often highlight the sadness underlying itali. + &gt; * y The Mind. John Fitzgerald. Salmon Poetry. 125 pp €12 pb2i cm +1-907056-60-4. Fitzgerald is an attorney for the disabled and this is his third poetry collection after Spring Water and Telling Time by the Shadows. The cover of this book has an eye-catching portrait of Fitzgerald by artist Don Barchardy. The poems explore the idea of the mind and what it is capable of. Many are dark in tone dealing with pain, inability and loss. The poems are divided into sections, titles are brief - just one word or number - and so are the poems. Fitzgerald is sparing in his use of words and is careful to craft his images as succinctly as possible. * ·■ &gt; * y Silent Music. Adam Wyeth. Salmon Poetry. 69 pp €12 pb2i cm +1-907056-65-9. English-born Wyeth has been living in county Cork for ten years and has submerged himself in the Irish literary scene. While the core of his interests remains poetry, he has been involved in different areas over the years such as working for journals, reading in schools and even putting poetry on film. Besides this his work has appeared in a number of anthologies published in Ireland and Britain. Surprisingly this is his first collection of published work. His poems are clever and often deceptive as he sets upan image of one thing, like the globe, only for it to turn out to be something else, like an artichoke. His are poems that you cannot take for granted. *·-./* y Winter Dogs. Drew Blanchard. Salmon Poetry. 61 pp €12 pbzi cm +1-907056-62-8. Award-winning poet Blanchard is currently studying for a PhD in the university of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, having earlier spent time as a graduate student in NUI Maynooth. Geographically his poems range wide although they are mostly downbeat observations of people in which he uses negative expressions for effect. He charts the things that people obsess about or are haunted by and describes the torments their emotions put them through. The title poem is a haunting description of post-soviet Russia, for example. * — r * y The Geese at the Gates. Drucilla Wall. Salmon Poetry. 79 pp €12 pb 21 cm +1-907056-59-8. This is a first collection from an American poet with an interest in Ireland. Since 1985 she has been a regular visitor to the country. Many of the poems have already appeared in literary journals or anthologies in the United States and Ireland. Some of them have an Irish theme or setting, such as 'Wild Orchids, Enniscorthy', while others have more of an historical theme. What they all have in common are observations on human existence, often expressed with humour and wit and a sympathy for people. + Λ / * ✓ Kentucky Derby. Andrea Cohen. Salmon Poetry. 77 pp €12 pb2i cm +1-907056-56-7. Massachusetts based Cohen is well established as a poet. She has Democratic Left : the life and death of an Irish political party. Kevin Rafter. Irish Academic Press. 378 PP + 8 of photos €19.95 pb 23 cm. +0-7165-3112 8. The Official Republican movement in its various guises has come under scrutiny recently from historians and political analysts. Rafter probably falls into the latter category given his background in journalism which enabled him to witness at first hand many of the events he describes. The subtitle might seem odd since to some it seems that, far from dying, Democratic Left successfully took over the Labour Party displacing its indigenous hierarchy. It might be seen as the ultimate act of infiltration which, as Rafter shows, was a key tactic of the party over the years. Much of the story here is already in the public domain but Rafter writes a vivid account which highlights the origins, tactics and progression of the party. It truly punched above its weight not just in the political arena but in the media as well where it had some high profile sympathisers.

Veritas. 64 pp wire-stitched30 cm +1-84730-272-4. The plans by the Catholic Church to introduce a new missal for use in mass has already proved controversial. The organisation representing priests in Ireland has issued a call for it not to be introduced and many lay people fail to see the necessity of producing a new missal. Published by the National Centre for Liturgy, the purpose of this book is to explain the thinking behind the missal, what the changes will mean and to highlight the continuity with the existing missal. It is at pains to point out that the mass itself will not change. *+ &gt; * Reparation and Repentance : a Eucharistie prayer service for Ireland. Kevin Scallon. Veritas. 20 pp wire-stitched 21 cm +1-84730-259-5. The prayer service here is part of the Catholic church's response to the revelations about the abuse of children by clerics and the scandal surrounding that. It was produced in answer to a call by Pope Benedict XVI to the people of Ireland for prayers of reparation and repentance. It has been used in a number of parishes since it was introduced at the intercession for priests at All Hollows College recently. It is a collection of psalms, prayers and readings inspired by this theme. ++ &gt; * η j i'i ii &gt;ii'i if ι it Girl in the Mirror. Cecelia Ahern. HarperCollins. 95 pp £7.99 hb 17 cm +0-00-742503-7. With its pastel cover and black and white sketches this has an old fashioned air, and the two stories in it are in a way fairy tales for adults. Despite the case binding, this is a rather flimsy offering from Ahern. However with 3.5 million copies sold of her earlier books and a successful television series, she is probably no longer in it for the money. The title story is the first and it is a tale of Lila whose life is dramatically changed by the revelation of a long buried fa m ily secret-a staple senario for chiditerati. The other story, The Memory Maker, is about a man who is trying to hold on to the memories that a disorder is robbing him of. *» -*■ % s YOUNG READERS Bean Uasal Mhisniúil. Siobhán Mhic Gearailt.

Fifteen famous legends and folktales, from the adventures of Fionn MacCumhal and Setanta to tales of leprechauns and witches, are told in a simple, easy-to-read fashion while the accompanying illustrations are in black line only, the outlines continuous so that the colourist can't go wrong. * * * / Irish Famine Workhouse. Pat Hegarty. GHI&amp; Macmillan. 35 pp €7.99 pb 20 cm +0-7171-4943-8. A handsome book which aims to make Irish history more accessible to the younger reader (7-11). Using a pop-up spread, flaps and 'reproductions' of documents alongside more conventional illustrations, with hand-written text, it brings the Great Famine to life, and shows how families were forced into the workhouse. It is a companion piece to Life on a Famine Ship and is told indiaryform by Declan Duffy, the boy of the family. Beneath the style and format is solid historical research but the format gives the history of these years a human face. * - * ✓ Is Breá le Lúlú an Leabharlann. Aine Nie Cuinn, Rosalind Beardshaw.

Genealogy is a good way to introduce children to history in general and this is a complete if elementary kit in which the reader (ages 7 -11 we guess) can compile a family tree. It comes with a folded chart nearly four times the size of the book, in which to record your own family, with spaces for six brothers and sisters and eight parents! The book offers step-by-step guidance to research - suggesting talking to older relatives, using the internet, finding records in a library and so on.

Four nice big colourful picture books for perhaps sixes to tens providing a lot of information and ideas about bees, spiders, butterflies and moths, and ants, all in Irish, and particularly aiming to familiarise young people with the natural environment and defuse any tendency to see bugs and creepy-crawlies as frightening. There's a certain amount of anthropomorphism - but not we thought objectionable for the target age group - but there's no tendency to over-simplify or avoid difficult words. After all reading skills come from challenges, not from easy reading. The books started life in Barcelona, and perhaps in Catalan for all we know.

Moody Scandinavian thrillers are in vogue, thanks in part to the television series Wallander. This is similar fare served for teenagers. It might not exactly be a policier but it is set in Sweden and is dark and foreboding. The hero Mik must chose between living in the city with his drunkard father or in an idyllic northern village with his bohemian aunt, but is the choice his to make? The author is a freelance journalist and photographer and the book has already sold well in Swedish and was shortlisted for the German International Children's Book Prize. The English translation was done by Susan Beard and financial assistance for it was provided by the Ireland Literature Exchange whose valuable initiatives and support we don't acknowledge as regularly as we should.
