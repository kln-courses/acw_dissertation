<plain_text><page sequence="1">Moshe Idel ON SOME FORMS OF ORDER IN KABBALAH /. Introduction Various forms of mysticism, among them the Kabbalah, have often been labeled as irrational forms of thought. Understood from perspectives that assume an unequivocal approach to reality and to the meaning of texts, this label had an impact on the scholars. Explanations based on the assumption that paradox is the sign of truth,1 assumptions about the Kabbalists5 possession of a special spiritual configuration and their consequent predisposition for a symbolic mode of thought,2 or the view that Kabbalah is dramatically mythocentric and of Gnostic extraction3 — all of these notions made their safe way into the See Gershom Scholem's motto to his monumental monograph, Sabbatai Sevi, and the discussion of Steven M. Wasserstrom in his Religion after Religion: Gershom Scholem, Mircea Eliade, and Henry Corbin at Eranos (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1999), pp. 223-24. See Isaiah Tishby, Paths of Belief and Heresy (Magnes Press, Jerusalem, 1982), p. 11 (Hebrew). G. Scholem, On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism, New York, 1965, p. 88. "Myth as a central spiritual power" is a fine formulation of Scholem's total vision of Kabbalah, a vision I propose to call mythocentric. For analyses of Scholem's view of Gnosticism see David Biale, Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-History (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1979), pp. 113,128-133,137-143; Biale's article on Scholem in Mircea Eliade's Encyclopaedia of Religion, vol. 13 (1987), pp. 119-120, especially his statement that "Scholem identified the central myth of Kabbalah as Gnostic"; Joseph Dan, Gershom Scholem: The Mystical Dimension of Jewish History (New York University Press, New York, 1987), pp. 41-44; and Moshe Idel, 'Subversive Catalysts: Gnosticism and Messianism in Gershom Scholem's View of Jewish Mysticism,' in David N.

Gnosticism was conceived of as a protest form of literature that denigrates this world and looks for liberation. The Gnostic understanding of Kabbalah also impacted the vision of this lore as implying a substantial search for the freedom from the repressive Rabbinic establishment.4 In fact, the vast literature described as mystical, including the Kabbalistic branch, is much more diversified, and its description by means of generic terms, such as 'paradoxical' or 'mythical,' suffers from oversimplification. The Kabbalists, to turn now specifically to the field that will preoccupy me in the following discussion, were different personalities, who drew their ideas from many sources and built different systems. Those systems, when this is what they are, should be analyzed with open-mindedness that goes beyond the perception that they are no more than various manifestations of a mythocentric or paradoxical mode of thought, or simply a search for spiritual freedom. Such characterizations were often proposed as antithetic to the 'rational' forms of Jewish thought, those designated as 'philosophy' or 'Halakhah'. In fact, there was, and there still is, a scholarly propensity, romantic in some of the sources, to celebrate the (allegedly) irrational — a category deemed to express the Kabbalists' dynamic and anarchic propensities vis a vis the literary creativity of the "establishment". Modern scholars have inverted the aversion of the authors of the Enlightenment toward the mystical and the irrational by acknowledging and adopting those categories as crucial and positive. The famous and stark distinctions between Kabbalah and philosophy on the one hand, and Kabbalah and Halakhah on the other, govern many of the past and present analyses of Jewish mysticism.5 An essentialistic approach to Kabbalah produced the feeling that this lore might be better understood as a protest, a rebellion, or sometimes even as an antinomian mode of thought. On the one hand, it was conceived of as fighting the war of the defeated ancient myths,6 on the other hand, it was conceived of as offering a Jewish alternative to the alien modes of thought adapted by Jewish philosophers, especially the Neo Aristotelian version of Judaism as formulated by Maimonides.7 To be sure, there is some limited truth in each of these statements. However, when taken to the extreme or generalized, those understandings of the Kabbalah as engaged in a constant battle with an allegedly repressive establishment, or as struggling For different formulations of the assumption that Kabbalists were afraid of the reaction of theological authorities see the references to Gershom Scholem's studies in Moshe Idel, Studies in Ecstatic Kabbalah (SUNY Press, Albany, 1989), p. 21 note 11.

After all, many of the major Kabbalists were also significant legalistic figures. Making premature synthetic statements about the homogenous nature of such a vast and voluminous literature without first adducing and carefully analyzing substantial material that may, or may not, corroborate such general statements, contributes little but can be quite confusing. So too are the general scholarly views that suggest too stark an antagonism between Kabbalah and other major branches of literature, whether Jewish or not, in an attempt to establish its importance by emphasizing its uniqueness. In the following pages, an attempt will be made to offer a methodological approach for examining the variegated Kabbalistic literature against the background of both the Biblical and Rabbinic forms of order, on the one hand, and the medieval forms of order, on the other. This proposal strives to handle two different sets of problems. One of them involves seeing Kabbalistic literature as confronting a variety of forms of order, while accepting and interpreting some, and rejecting others. This is a question that basically deals with the organization of knowledge, a conceptual strategy that became more demanding in the Middle Ages, when Jewish thinkers confronted a much more variegated series of corpora mostly of Greek or Hellenistic extraction, which embodied significant forms of knowledge, and had to react to them, by either interpreting and incorporating them in one hierarchical form or another, or by totally rejecting them. This is even more evident in the case of the Kabbalah, which is a relatively belated series of writings. As such, it dealt with much traditional material as well as with new forms of knowledge. The other set of problems that the methodology presented below may help solving is related to the need to better characterize the nature of the different corpora that encountered in the Middle Ages and sometimes influenced each other. In many cases in modern scholarship, the various corpora are described in reference to such generic terms as 'Jewish,' 'Arabic,' 'Greek,' or 'Christian.' This form of distinction gives rise to numerous problems. What, one may ask, is precisely Jewish in a Hebrew-written text on astrology that derives it material from a variety of Hindu and Arabic sources? Or what is peculiarly Jewish in a medieval commentary on Averroes which is written in Hebrew by a Jewish author? Similarly, what is specifically Arabic in a magical treatise translated from the Greek via the Syriac rendition? Do the language and the national or religious identity of the compiler, translator or commentator, automatically produce a significant impact on the specific formulation of content in any given text? Thus, instead of resorting to generic terms, I propose to identify units organized according to a certain logic, whose occurrence in conjunction with other units is likely to form the conceptual texture of some system. Those</page><page sequence="4">XXXIV Moshe Idel units are smaller than the voluminous corpora, and their definition will allow a more precise understanding than that which is gained by using general terms like 'Greek,' 'Jewish,' 'Arabic,' and so forth. The description of those units, even if they are characteristic of a certain literature or culture, should first and foremost address their specific phenomenological structure, rather than merely relying on general terms. In this way, the specific Jewish character of such a unit will emerge not only from its origins but also from the relative role it plays in the culture of Jews. For this purpose, I suggest to adopt a series of terms that point to different layers of organization especially pertinent to the Kabbalah. The smallest units are nouns understood as symbols. They may then become organized within a broader structure, to be called order, where they assume the form of comprehensive symbols. Different orders may be combined to form models, and once these models interact with each other, they may produce distinct systems. By the term 'order' I mean a sequence of homogenous signs, events or actions whose knowledge and enactment have meanings beyond their immanent one. As such, 'order' differs from 'model' — a concept that I described elsewhere.8 Models are more comprehensive patterns, whose structure, or order, signifies ideals and modes of activities. In the following presentation, I am more concerned with kinds of order than with their concatenations, however important these are. Concatenations of different kinds of order may generate models, which may appear in different literary schools and Kabbalistic corpora. Models may be conjoined and thus generate complex Kabbalistic and Hasidic systems. I also propose to distinguish between the concept of order as employed here and the formal arrangement of linguistic material according to the ten sefirot, as found in the vast Kabbalistic literature known as commentaries on ten sefirot and in the many commentaries on the commandments, where the discussions of the meaning of the commandments follow earlier patterns. My resort to concepts of order differs from that of Erich Voegelin in his monumental History and Order. While Voegelin understood the progression of religion and philosophy as the gradual discovery of a given order that is inherent in reality, I see in the different concepts of order some forms of imaginaire, as adopted and adapted by Kabbalists from different sources. Before turning to the details of my proposal, let me emphasize that my methodological remarks are not equally relevant for all forms of Kabbalistic See Idel, Hasidism: Between Ecstasy and Magic (SUNY Press, Albany, 1994), pp. 23-24, 49.</page><page sequence="5">On Some Forms of Order in Kabbalah XXXV narratives. They are more helpful in the case of the more speculative texts and are less so for the more confessional texts. 2. Forms of Order in Biblical and Rabbinic Literature Let me start with a short survey of what I conceive as the three main forms of order that are dominant in Biblical and Rabbinic literature. The most important among them is the ritual order. The assumption is that not only are the Jewish rites quintessential from the religious point of view but also that their performance has wider implications, such as the rainfall, according to the biblical view, or enhancing the divine power, according to the Rabbinic view. What is left unclear, however, is the precise nature of the causal relations between the actual performance of the ritual and its wider effects. The absence of detailed and systematic explanatory discussions is characteristic of the apodictic propensity of rabbinic writings. The second sort of order is the national/historical order. The underlying assumption of this order is that the Jews stand out as a corporate personality whose destiny is the central issue of human history in general. Furthermore, the vicissitudes that befall the Jews are closely related to their disobedience of the divine imperatives, which attracts the divine retributive intervention in the course of history and nature alike. According to some Rabbinic views, the exile involves not only the Jewish people; God too, or sometimes His presence, the Shekhinah, participates in it. Thus, far from being mere accidents, the random succession of unrelated or meaningless events, the historical vicissitudes are part of a broader story, which revolves around the ritual order. This story is the fulfillment of the divine will through the agency of a very definite national entity, whose emergence and continuity is conceived of as one of the main concerns of biblical and rabbinic literature. Finally, the literary order is governed by the notion that the text of the Hebrew Bible and then the Rabbinic canons, namely the Mishnah and the Talmud, along with their intense and repeated study, are a central form of preoccupation among Jews, to the extent that God Himself is imagined to participate in it. Though the biblical text and, later on, the Rabbinic ones contain the two former types of order, the literary order has a specific dimension, that of dense textuality. This means that not only the messages but also the precise details of the document that conveys them are of paramount importance. The conceptions embodied in those three forms of order have been absorbed by intense study and practice and shape the mode of thought and action of at least significant parts of the elite Jews. As part of the propensity for the</page><page sequence="6">XXXVI Moshe Idel concrete, which characterizes biblical and rabbinic literature, the three types of order are basically visible; they can be discerned, respectively, in the relevant texts, in the national/historical events and in the performance of the ritual. The common denominator of these types of order is the centrality of human action and human fate. Objective structures not primarily oriented toward the well being of humans, like the invisible Platonic ideas or the Aristotelian God as intellect, are not presupposed as quintessential from the religious point of view. Furthermore, while cosmic order are basically static the ancient Greek forms of, gravitating towards concepts of perfection, the Jewish orders mentioned above are much more dynamic and present the human fate as their main topic. The nature of intermediary structures and their specific orders, which may be sporadically found in those literatures, such as the divine attributes, known as the middot, divine Glory, decadic structures, and angelic ones, play only secondary roles in biblical and rabbinic literature, though they are more manifest in other literatures which were, for the Rabbinic authors, secondary, like the Heikhalot literature, or some forms of Jewish magic, such as Sefer ha-Razim. We may characterize those forms of order as basically 'non-constellated', namely operating without substantial speculative superstructures or orders.9 The point I'm making here is that not only were most of the Kabbalists religious figures whose literary activities and, sometimes, the records of their life, too, amply testify to their conservative propensities (a view that does not need additional documentation), but that they contributed to the emergence of types of ontological concatenations between various aspects of reality in ways unknown to, or marginal in, Rabbinic Judaism. In some cases, the ritual concatenation of supernal orders created structures more similar to the myth-and-ritual views, though the supernal orders do not uniformly assume the form of mythical narratives. Kabbalists have woven broader nets that concatenated human activities and experiences into wider speculative constructs, producing a type of imaginaire in which more intense forms of connectiveness, and only quite exceptionally freedom, were the ideals the Kabbalists were in search for. Connectiveness is a broad term and I use it in order to point to both cosmic affinities that are contrived in Kabbalah in elaborated and novel ways, and to human adherence to supernal structures, what may be described as unio mystica and communion. Though plenty of reformist and antinomian stands are indeed found in 17th and 18th centuries Sabbatean and Frankist literatures, I hardly consider most of those stands See Moshe Idel, Absorbing Perfections: Kabbalah and Interpretation (Yale University Press, New Haven, 2002), pp. 221-249.</page><page sequence="7">On Some Forms of Order in Kabbalah XXXVII as reflecting significant features of earlier centuries of Kabbalistic creativity.10 Concerned more with finding the alleged hidden meanings of the Halakhic way of life, and forging detailed mystical anomian techniques, in fact two different forms of order, most of the writings of Kabbalists display a linkage between the nature of those paths and the manner in which God and the encounter with Him have been described." 3. Medieval Jewish Pursuits of New Types of Comprehensive Order Kabbalah, just like other corpora of Jewish speculative literature that emerged in the Middle Ages, was in a constant search for comprehensive forms of order. This is the case of the emergence of Hebrew grammar, of poetics, or of first accounts of scientific thought in Judaism. This is also true of the emergent philosophical pursuits: the first systematic descriptions of the divine realm, of human psychology, or of the concept of nature. Attempting to organize the various views on some of those topics as found in the early Jewish literature, medieval Jewish thinkers used categories that were previously absent from Judaism. Theology, metaphysics, psychology, nature, and science are nonexistent terms in the Hebrew or Aramaic of pre-medieval biblical and Rabbinic corpora, and the resort to those categories of thought also called for the necessary linguistic innovations. By introducing those categories, some of the Jewish thinkers had to attenuate the more personalistic, voluntaristic forms of order mentioned in the previous section. Different as the various forms of Jewish philosophy, grammar, science or Kabbalistic literature are, they nevertheless share a new pathos for order. It is an order that operates not only in the realm of objective nature but also in the structure of language and of the human psyche, and in the realm of religious activities. More complex forms of order emerged, which correlated two or more of those forms of order. Forms consisting of sympathetic affinities between the different levels of order created modes of integration that seemed to be new in Judaism. Not only was the world conceived of as an organized universe, a cosmos. Even God was drawn into this integrated system and conceived of as part of it. This is already obvious in the Greek systems, in which God or the gods were not only generative concepts but also paradigmatic concepts: Aristotle,s metaphysics, which describes God as an intellect, created an axiology in which the human act of intellection becomes paramount. Sympathetic magic, of Neoplatonic and Hermetic extraction, which relates human acts to astral processes, is another 10 See, however, below, Concluding Remarks. 11 See Moshe Idel, Enchanted Chains (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="8">XXXVIII Moshe Idel example of an integrated system. Both modes of integrated thought were adopted in some forms of medieval Judaism,12 including those of the Kabbalah. However, this zeal for integrated orders also generated more specifically Jewish expressions. The most widespread assumption, found in the main school of Kabbalah, the theosophical-theurgical, surmises that human actions, the fulfillment of the divine commandments, or the mitzvot, correspond to the divine structure, which is designated as a system of ten sefirot. This dynamic correlation presupposes the possibility that certain acts performed in the lower realm have an impact on the higher entities, an impact I proposed to call theurgy.13 In other cases, each of the supernal divine attributes was conceived of as governing a corresponding celestial sphere, a theory I propose to designate as theo-astrology.14 Sometimes, the theosophical-theurgical model and the theo astrological one were integrated so that the astral themes were incorporated into the understanding of the sefirotic systems.15 To summarize these discussions temporarily, the Kabbalists deemed themselves as possessing knowledge of forms of order unknown to, or hidden from the eyes of, other Jewish masters. This knowledge and its application were part of their superiority as religious persons. Unless one is aware of these hidden forms of order, the religious life he leads is superficial. Once this order is understood, the religious life of the Kabbalist becomes much more meaningful. At least according to such an understanding of Kabbalah, its mysticism hardly represents a search for freedom. Rather, it is indicative of the pursuit of a way of life based on the adoption of a stricter mode of conduct that allows it to be integrated into a larger structure. What is characteristic of the main Kabbalistic school, the theosophical-theurgical one, is the large-scale and minutely detailed affinity it created between the fulfillment of the divine commandments and the supernal or divine structures. Unlike the Rabbinic treatment of the mitzvot as basically non-constellated, namely as ungoverned by metaphysical structures, most of See Dov Schwartz, 'Different Forms of Magic in the Jewish Thought in the 14th Century Spain', PAAJR, vol.

See below, section 6.</page><page sequence="9">On Some Forms of Order in Kabbalah XXXIX the Kabbalists subordinated them to supernal entities and processes, thus creating more comprehensive frameworks.16 This tendency to form hierarchies and ontological chains of being by actively connecting analogical levels of reality, is characteristic of many medieval speculative forms of Judaism but is especially evident in the Kabbalistic resort to the concept of hishtalshelut, or shalshelet, terms which refer to intra-divine chains of emanation.17 Many of the Kabbalists created an imaginaire of the universe permeated by many concatenations, analogies, occult affinities and sympathies, and intricate subordinations and hierarchies, most of which are absent from Rabbinic literature. Thus, for instance, in the writings R. Eleazar of Worms of the early 13th century, we find a descending hierarchy of faces, which starts with the divine face and ends with the human face.18 What is characteristic of many of those emanational chains is that they are flexible in the sense that they depended on the human religious acts below, and hence their vulnerability. Unlike the static nature — in the sense of not being dependent on human actions — of the Great Chain of Being, as described in Lovejoy^ classical study of the same title, many of the Kabbalistic descriptions assume the existence of a mutual influence whereby the performance of the ritual impacts the supernal constellations that govern that performance, and vice-versa.19 We may thus conceive of the transformation of the non-constellated approach into a constellated one as one of the major processes that characterizes the transition between the Biblical and Rabbinic literatures on the one hand, and medieval speculative literatures on the other. These different speculative constellations constitute different forms of attaching meaning to modes of religiosity that were more concerned with shaping a religious modus operandi than with formulating systematic worldviews. These processes of creating meaning are attained by constructing narratives that endow ritualistic acts and mystical techniques with the possibility of transcending the situation of relative disorder, which is prevalent in the external world, in the human psyche or within the divinity itself, and thereby attaining a superior order. Far from attempting to liberate themselves from the strictures of halakhic life, many Kabbalists actually added more customs from time to time and also demanded a more intense performance of all the religious precepts and the fathoming of 16 See note 20 below. 17 On this topic see Idel, Enchanted Chains. 18 See M. Idel, 'Gazing at the Head in Ashkenazi Hasidism,' Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy, vol. 6 (1997), pp. 265-300. 19 See my Enchanted Chains, passim.</page><page sequence="10">XL Moshe Idel linguistic techniques that by now were understood to be fraught with special mystical valences. This effort of attributing a special impact to human religious deeds has much to do with the process of creating new systems of affinities. This propensity is especially evident in the voluminous Kabbalistic literature that deals with the rationales of the commandments. This kind of literature has recently attracted some renewed attention, and we shall start our discussions about Kabbalah and order with this seminal topic.20 4. Rituals and Anthropomorphic Superstructures The centrality of the human bodily structure for the religious worldview of the Israelite thought and for the Rabbis is evident. The importance of the image of man is a leit-motif that permeates those literatures.21 However, it is only rarely in Talmudic literature that the six hundred and thirteen commandments as accepted by the later are Rabbis, have been related to human limbs. Since the commandments action-oriented, they are performed by means of the limbs, but the early Rabbis did not articulate a correspondence between the limbs and the commandments. Despite the fact that no special problem was involved in depicting God anthropomorphically and in some few cases God has been portrayed by the Rabbis as performing a particular commandment, like donning phylacteries for example,22 there is also no indication in rabbinic literature of a correspondence between the commandments and the divine limbs. However, the rise of the theory of the supernal anthropos, 'Adam 'Elyon, in the main trend of Kabbalah opened the way to introducing complex affinities between the commandments and the human and divine limbs. Instances of such form of isomorphism and correspondences abound in the theosophical theurgical Kabbalah. According to the notion that developed during the first centuries of Kabbalah, the supernal man is basically compounded of ten manifestations, while the six hundred thirteen commandments are See Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, pp. XIII-XV, 156-199; Charles Mopsik, Les grands textes de la Cabale: Les rites qui font Dieu (Verdier, Lagrasse, 1993); Elliot R.

See BT, Berakhot, fol. 6a.</page><page sequence="11">On Some Forms of Order in Kabbalah XLI dependent on these ten divine attributes. Thus, a decadic order, possessing an anthropomorphic structure, was imagined to organize the vast realm of Rabbinic ritual by explaining the manner in which the commandments are performed by specific human limbs and depend upon the divine ones and affect them. Let me introduce here the term comprehensive symbol in order to clarify the anthropomorphic superstructure understood as order. The phrase ,Adam ,Elyon refers to a complex structure of ten sefirot and thus joins together several symbols of the limbs to form a unified whole that functions as a symbol in itself. Since this combination also involves a variety of factors and processes, it represents a complex reality by capturing its anatomical structure and physiological processes. From this point of view, this symbol functions like other comprehensive symbols of the ten sefirot, such as Paradise,23 the sefirotic Tree, the divine name, and the Temple.24 The correspondence is, therefore, not only a matter of formal parallelism, a structural similarity. Rather, it involves active affinities that generate an integrated universe, within which ritual performance is explained in a significant and detailed manner. Let me give one example of such an integrated theory by resorting to a late 13th century anonymous text, entitled Sefer ha Yihud: The pious people and the men of deeds know how to direct the powers.25 And what do "men of deeds" mean? As in the saying: "Whoever keeps my commandments, I regard as if he has made Me, as it is written,26 'It is a time to make God" — literally, [since] whoever blemishes below, blemishes above, and whoever purifies himself below, adds strength...above.27 This theory, which attributes to the ritual order the power to make God, a theory that is reminiscent of the Hermetic practice of making God,28 left an On this topic see Idel, Absorbing Perfections, pp. 299-301. See Havivah Pedaya, Name and Sanctuary in the Teaching of R. Isaac Sagi Nahor: A Comparative Study in the Writings of the Earliest Kabbalists (Jerusalem, 2001) (Hebrew). Namely, the Sefirot. Psalms 119:126; I translated the verse in the way the author intended it to be understood. Strangely enough, the second half of the verse states: "They have made void thy Torah." Ms. Milano-Ambrosiana 62, fol. 113a. This text was copied with some variations by R. Menahem Recanati, Commentary on the Torah (Jerusalem, 1961), fol. 51c and R. Meir ibn Gabbai's 'Avodat ha-Qodesh (Jerusalem, 1963), part I,fol. 26c. See my forthcoming Hermeticism and Kabbalah.</page><page sequence="12">XLII Moshe Idel indelible imprint on Kabbalistic literature. R. Joseph of Hamadan, a late 13th century Kabbalist plausibly active in Castile and apparently influenced by the anonymous text, writes in his Ta'amei ha-Mitsvot: Happy is the man who knows how to relate one limb29 to another and one form to another [form],30 as they are found in the Holy and Pure Chain,31 blessed be His Name, because the Torah is His form, blessed be He. He commanded us to study Torah in order to know the likeness of the Supernal Form, as some Kabbalists said:32 'Cursed is whomever will not keep this Torah up.' Can the Torah fall? This [verse should be understood as] a warning for the cantor to show the written form of the Torah scroll to the community in order for them to see the likeness of the Supernal Form. Moreover, the study of Torah induces one to see the supernal secrets and the Glory of the Holy One, blessed be He, indeed."33 Thus, there is a basic isomorphic affinity between the human and the divine structures. Yet, far more important than this formal affinity is the theurgic affinity. For according to many other statements of this Kabbalist, it is precisely the knowledge of the latter that allows to strengthen or sustain the supernal limbs through the performance of the ritual by the corresponding lower limbs. Different forms of order collapse into each other: the linguistic, the anthropomorphic human and divine, the ritual. All of these are conceived of as related to each other. The convergence of the anthropomorphic and the linguistic orders is obvious. According to R. Menahem Recanati, an early 14th century Kabbalist, who follows some adumbrations of this view by certain Geronese and Castilian Kabbalists, the commandments and the sefirot are one and the same thing.34 Elsewhere he writes that by performing a commandment below, one brings down the divine influx, namely the corresponding sefirah on high, onto the 'Ever, namely a human limb, which corresponds to the parallel divine limb. The term tzurah means external form, unlike Maimonides' use of this term in its Aristotelian sense, which points to the essential form or to cosmic intellects understood as angels. See also immediately below in the quote from Recanati. Shalshelet ha-qedushah ve-ha-tohorah. This phrase recurs in R. Joseph's writings and refers to the structure of ten sefirot. Deut. 27:26.1 translated the verse in the literal way in which R. Joseph understood it. Ms. Jerusalem NUL 80 3925, fol. 110b.

A fascination with the profound affinities between the sefirotic realm, the Torah, and man is found in a classic of Kabbalah, written by R. Meir ibn Gabbai, an influential 16th century Kabbalist. Fie explicitly envisioned the Torah as isomorphic to God and at the same time as an anthropomorphic structure serving as an intermediary entity in between man and the divine: The Torah is, therefore, the wholeness [kelal] of the grand and supernal Anthropos, and this is the reason why it comprises the 248 positive commandments and the 365 negative commandments, which are tantamount to the number of the limbs and sinews of the lower and the supernal man...and since the Torah has man's shape, it is fitting to be given to man, and man is man by its virtue, and at the end he will cleave to Man.37 Following some earlier Kabbalist, like Recanati in the passage quoted above, ibn Gabbai identifies the Torah with an anthropos. For him, the Torah is an intermediary man, a mesoanthropos, as it is "the intermediary which stirs the supernal image towards the lower one."38 Or, according to another statement of his, "The Torah and the commandments are the intermediary that links the lower image with the supernal one, through the affinity they have with both."39 The literary order (Torah) and the ritual order (the commandments), which were described above in connection to Rabbinic thought, are thus identified Ibid., fol. 13c.

If we consider the various forms of depiction of the realm of ten sefirot, as it developed in the course of time, it becomes obvious that the anthropic picture emerges as incomparably more dominant than the image of the sefirotic tree, notwithstanding the theological problematics that the former may have stirred in some circles. The reason for this is that the depiction of the sefirotic realm in terms of the anthropos lent itself to the notion of the theurgical affinities between the human and the divine structures. The above citation is a fine example of the kabbalists' integrating effort, which found its expression in establishing affinities and forms of analogies that have ontological valences. The anthropomorphic order of the Kabbalistic imaginaire of divinity absorbs the lower orders through the ritualistic order, which represents a human physiology of sorts that puts in motion the anatomy of the divine realm. This suggests the strong role theurgy plays in ibn Gabbai's thought. A rather neglected, though interesting, Kabbalist of the late 16th century, named R. Yehudah ben Jacob Hunain, formulated a conception that, notwithstanding its similarity to that of ibn Gabbai, seems to be independent of it: Just as the war was below, so it was above, because of the sin of Israel; for the righteous add force and power in the higher assembly40...and when they [Israel] act in the opposite [way], it is as if they weaken the supernal force...for the lower [entities] are like the root and modus41 of the supernal [entities].42 It is here that the point that I want to explicate is made explicit: the supernal theosophical structures are indubitably higher than the human structure and its actions. Nevertheless, the latter are explicitly described as the roots of the former. If the main purposes of the ritual, according to the 13th to 16th century theosophical-theurgical Kabbalists, are to enhance the power of the divine limbs, to unify the feminine and the masculine divine powers, or to cause the ascent of the lower sefirot toward the higher ones — then with the emergence of the comprehensive system of Rabbi Isaac Luria Ashkenazi in the 1570s, a new and influential interpretation of the rationale for the commandments was articulated. Here, too, the performance of the commandments is regulated by 40 In this context it stands for angels. 41 Ofan.

However, the new assumption is that part of that structure has been shattered by a primordial catastrophe, the so-called breaking of the vessels, which caused the fall of particles of the divine configuration into the realm of coarse materiality or even evil powers. Those divine sparks should be rescued and made to return to their initial place of the Adam Qadmon, a mission that entails the performance of the commandments with the proper Kabbalistic intention. Thus, we read in one of the most widespread Lurianic statements dealing with the commandment of studying Torah that: All his intention must be to link his soul and bind her to her supernal source by means of the Torah. And his intention must be to achieve thereby the restoration of the supernal anthropos, which is the ultimate intention of the creation of man and the goal of the commandment to study Torah...As when studying Torah man must intend to link his soul and unite her and make her cleave to her source above...and he must intend thereby to perfect the supernal [sefirotic] tree and the holy anthropos.43 The different anthropomorphic superstructures not only loaded the commandments with a more "profound" meaning but also served as exegetical codes for interpreting canonical texts, an important issue that cannot be dealt with here.44 The combination of the anthropomorphic and the ritual orders produced the most important forms of the Kabbalistic theosophical-theurgical model. 5. Linguistic Concatenations Quite different, though equally influential, is the belief of Kabbalists, and of some non-Kabbalist masters, that certain forms of order are inherent in the structure of the linguistic discourse as found in canonical texts, especially in the Bible. Numerical affinities between the different linguistic units of religious documents were conceived of not only as pertinent to the understanding of the inner sense of that document, but also as important for the understanding of extra-textual forms of relationship — namely, those providing information 43 R. Hayyim Vital, Sha'ar ha-Mitzvot, per. Va-ethanan, p. 78, and Luria's Hanhagot; cf. Lawrence Fine, Safed Spirituality, p. 68; Jacob Tzemah's book, Nagid u-Metzaveh (Lemberg, 1863), fol. i9b-20a. 44 See Idel, Absorbing Perfections, pp. 280-289, 449-460.</page><page sequence="16">XLVI Moshe Idel about the divine or the cosmic worlds. Here is an example that will also be helpful for some of the discussions below. It is found in a treatise written in 1286 by Rabbi Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia (1240-1291), the founder of ecstatic Kabbalah. In his writings, the linguistic units are conceived of as being on a higher level than that of the sefirot. According to one of his discussions, the sefirot, understood as numbers, are no more than twenty-two, which is eqaul to the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet. Since every Hebrew letter has a fixed numerical value and the last one, Tav, amounts to 400, the concept of any number that exceeds these numerical values, such as thousands and tens of thousands, becomes superfluous.45 This priority of the Hebrew letters, and of linguistic perspective in general, over the sefirot (sometimes conceived of as numbers, in a rather Pythagorean manner), is quite remarkable and I would like to underline its importance by referring to a specific passage written by Abulafia though it reverberated much beyond his writings: There are three [categories] of time that are intelligized by human intellect and these are divided into three [distinct] parts. Similarly, Howeh (הוה) and Hayah (והיה) and Yihiyeh (ויהיה) are always intelligized by the divine intellect — all three as one principle... because the divine, separate intellect does not fall under the [category of] past time, or under the [category of] future time, as these two [concepts] point to movements and time is discerned by them...and this is the reason why, according to our faith, the Hawwayyot cannot be described as created [entities]. Namely, of the ten Hawwayyot from which the ten sefirot had been generated by necessity, one is the cantor, [or] the ruler, which is the tenth. And the beginning of the Hawwayyot is God, blessed be His Name, who is in the midst of the Hawwayyot, and [at the same time] He Himself is the end of the Hawwayyot. And in the Hawwayyot there are supernal wonders, and so too in the sefirot and in the chariots46 and in man.47 The end of the passage sets the tenor of the entire discussion: there is a descending hierarchy, starting at the top, with God as a unified knowing intellect within which there are ten Hawwayyot. The latter is a seminal term, which has numerous meanings in Kabbalistic literature. Yet, it seems that in this particular context it points to the ten letters (derived from the Tetragrammaton) 45 See Otzar 'Eden Ganuz, ed. Amnon Gross (Jerusalem, 2000), p. 15. 46 Merkkavot. 47 Ms. Paris BN 774, fol. 148b. For more on this passage see M. Idel, 'Sefirot above the Sefirot,' Tarbiz, vol. 51 (1982), pp. 260-261 (Hebrew).</page><page sequence="17">On Some Forms of Order in Kabbalah XLV1I that form the three divine names emerging from the verb forms of 'be' that convey the past (hayah), the present (howweh), and the future (Yihiyeh). Subordinated to these ten essences are the sefirot, apparently once again a term that has the connotation of numbers, followed by some lower entities called chariots, which are in turn followed by man. We thus have a relatively clear, though complex, hierarchy in which it is the letters of the names of God that are found at the very top. It is crucial to point out, however, that for Abulafia, the knowledge of this hierarchy is only the starting point for a process of mystical transformation, based upon a strong reliance on language, especially on the letters of the divine names. The detailed forms of order of the combination of letters of the divine names were very important to him, as evidenced by the fact that he dedicated to this topic several handbooks. This intermediary role of the knowledge of the divine name is well expressed in Otzar 'Eden Ganuz, where it is said that: The knowledge of the names is a supreme degree that towers above all the human degrees that share the divine degrees, namely that they [the names] announce the way in which the soul is united with the Agent Intellect, in an eternal union, and there is no other way that approximates to it in elevating the soul to this wondrous degree.48 The linguistic order presented here as the names of God can be known and the effect of this knowledge, once implemented, goes beyond the mere act of getting acquainted with a certain topic. Recitations of the divine names are capable of transforming the human intellect into the Agent Intellect. In this last quote, the linguistic order is envisioned as changing the human psyche, and this is the main concern of Abulafia's ecstatic Kabbalah. Yet, the linguistic orders were conceived of as being able to affect other realms of reality as well. Operating with concepts similar to what has been quoted above from Abulafia's Sitrei Torah, his former student, Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla, writes in one of his earlier treatises: The motion of this world corresponds to the motions of the letters, which point to this [motion], to the paths of the 'guidances' of the world and the paths of action — how they all descend according to the chain of computation49.50 48 Ed. Gross, p. 337. 49 Shalshelet ha-Heshbon. Interestingly enough, the term 'chain' does not occur in Abraham Abulafia's writings, though he was the teacher of the young Gikatilla. 50 See Ginnat 'Egoz (Hanau, 1615), fol. 46b.</page><page sequence="18">XLVIII Moshe Idel The passage is based upon a pun: in Hebrew the term tenu'ah, which occurs in the text several times, means both a motion and a vowel. Thus the motions in the world correspond to the vocalizations of the consonants. What is less clear is the resort to the term 'chain', which is related to cosmic reality. In any case, it is clear that both Abulaila and Gikatilla conceived the relationship between language and the cosmic entities as one in which the former takes precedence over the latter. A Renaissance Kabbalist, the late 15th century Rabbi Yohanan Alemanno, active in Florence, adopts some earlier views dealing with the world of letters and names and combines them with a theory of magic: The Kabbalists believe that Moses, peace be with him, had precise knowledge of the spiritual world, which is called the World of Sefirot, and of the world of the Divine Names, or the World of letters.51 Moses knew how to direct his thoughts and prayers so as to improve the divine influx, which the Kabbalists call 'channels'; Moses' action caused the channels to bring down the emanations onto the lower world in accordance with his will. By means of that influx, he created anything he wished, just as God created the world by means of various emanations. Whenever he wished to perform signs and wonders, Moses would pray and utter divine names, words and meditations, until he intensified those emanations. The emanations then descended into the world and created new supra natural things. With that, Moses split the sea, opened up the earth and the like.52 Attention should be drawn first to the affinity between the metaphysical worlds of letters and names, and Moses' linguistic mode of operation in using names, words and prayers. I assume that for Alemanno, the two linguistic levels correspond to each other from the point of view of their particular nature, and the lower is conceived of as capable of impacting the higher. However, the supernal world of letters is portrayed as higher than the sefirot and thus capable of having an impact on the quantity of influx they receive. Because of their superior status, the divine names and letters inform the dynamic of the more widespread structure of the divine attributes as well as the changes 51 On the question of the human possibility to understand the supernal structures see also below, in Concluding Remarks, especially note 72. 52 Collectanea, Ms. Oxford-Bodleiana 2234, fol. 8b; Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, p. 204; idem, 'The Epistle of R.

Though it does not occur in this passage, Alemanno is very fond also of the astral order, including the theory of Shemittot (to be discussed in the next section), and accordingly he offers a stratified and sympathetic worldview. Let me turn now to the way in which language has been treated by a theosophical-theurgical Kabbalist, the 16th century Safedian R. Elijah de Vidas. Out of His love for man, God has fixed these [twenty-two Hebrew] letters in the mouth of man, in order to enable him to cleave to his Creator; by the very pronunciation of the sounds here below, when he studies Torah or prays, he shakes and stirs up the roots above. The meaning of the verb "fixed" is similar to sticking the end of a chain in one place, and the other end in another place; the distance between the places notwithstanding, when a man shakes the end of the chain, which is in his hand, he shakes the whole chain...and so we can understand the virtue of our ancestors, whose prayers were answered immediately, since they were careful not to defile the twenty-two letters that are [articulated in] five places within the mouth.53 Here, an ascending move is described: the letters recited here below are imagined as influencing higher powers. This is a form of magic that allows man to exploit the connectiveness inherent in the chain of being that unites the divine realm to the human voice. Thus, though a hierarchy of ontological levels is obvious in the writings of this Kabbalist, the dynamic of affinities between those levels gives certain precedence to the lower level over the higher one. Sacred texts and ritualistic recitations have a strong impact by dint of the ascending reverberations of human words. In other words, the linguistic order, like the ritual one, determines the type of effects that may be attained from the anthropomorphic order. Following the theory of Sefer Yetzirah, it should be emphasized that the sounds produced by the vocal apparatus are the auditory form of the Hebrew alphabet, again a rather particularistic sort of approach. 6. Supernal Cyclic Orders One of the most prevailing perceptions of Judaism is that it is, fundamentally, a history-oriented religion, based upon the assumption that the most important 53 R. Elijah de Vidas, Reshit Hokhmah, (Jerusalem, 1984),ch. 10; II,p. 247.</page><page sequence="20">L Moshe Idel progression of time is the linear one. It is not only the writings of Mircea Eliade that disseminated this simplistic approach.54 The same is also true of the more general understanding of this religion, which is rooted in the notion that the core of this religion is the exile-redemption axis.55 This stand too easily confuses the historical plight of the Jews with the most important religious concerns. Not long ago, one scholar even went so far as to describe 'Judaic eschatologies' as solely historic.56 Truth to tell, however, important forms of cyclical eschatologies, of astrological origins, gradually became more and more influential from the 12th century onwards, as increasingly more scientific views were adopted by the Kabbalists. This is already true of R. Abraham bar Hiyya, the 11th century Barcelonese thinker. The same applies to Isaac ben Abraham ibn Latif of the mid-13th century and to many other Kabbalists that subscribed to the theory of cosmic Shemittot and Yovelim,57 an issue that will concern us here only marginally. While Biblical and Rabbinic forms of Judaism have central types of ritual, organized by what I propose to call microchronoi, the concept of cosmic chronology, or macrochronoi, is a later development, which assumed great importance beginning with the 12th century.58 This move toward a more cosmic religion involved significant adoption of astrological cyclical time, an orientation alien to the earlier stages of Judaism, and a vision of time that is independent of the ritual order. As part of the entrance of some of elite Jews into the more scientific world, cosmic processes were incorporated into kabbalistic theories to the extent that they dramatically problematized the relevance of the three earlier types of order in Judaism. Let me first adduce, however, a milder type of cyclical orders that was adopted by the kabbalists. This type exemplifies the cyclical organization of important rituals, such as is found in Nahmanides' thought. In an important and concise passage authored by R. Shem Τον ibn Gaon, one of the later disciples of the Geronese master, it is written as follows: See his Myth of the Eternal Return (Harper Torchbooks, New York, 1959). For a critique of his unilateral linear vision of religious time in Judaism see my study 'Some Concepts of Time and History in Kabbalah,' in Jewish in History and Jewish Memory: Essays in Honor of Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, eds. E. Carlebach, J. Efron, and D.N. Myers (Brandeis University Press, Hanover and London, 1998), pp.153-188.

Trompf, The Idea of Recurrence in Western Thought·. From Antiquity to the Renaissance (California University Press, Berkeley, 1979), pp. 138-139, 156ff. For an explication of these terms see Idel, 'Some Concepts of Time.'</page><page sequence="21">On Some Forms of Order in Kabbalah LI The principle I had handed down to you concerns the fact that the Sabbath, and the Shemittah, and the Festival of the Matzot [Passover] hint at one issue, which is part of the perimeter, while the festival of Shaviiot, the Shemini 'Atzeret, and the Jubilee hint at another issue, which is [found] outside the perimeter; and everything returns to the great Jubilee59.60 The perimeter, or the circumference, ha-heiqef, is a technical term, characteristic of this Kabbalistic school. This term stands for the seven lower sefirot, including perhaps their movements. Here it is related to the festivals that are associated with the number seven.611 assume that the term 'perimeter' indicates a circle, with each of the six or seven lower sefirot placed at some point on it. This circle is understood to be revolving in such a way that each of these powers gets to govern the lower world for a certain period of time, known as a Shemittah. Once the cycle of sevens come to an end, it is time for the reintegration of everything within the eighth higher sefirah. This takes place during the Jubilee, which is related to the sefirah of Binah, known also as Teshuvah, the cosmic "return". This sefirah, just like the two other festivals listed in this excerpt, is connected to the concept of 'eight'. In this way, the religious values, which were initially part of the non-constellated ritual order, are interpreted, and thus enriched, by the addition of cosmic and theosophical dimensions. At the same time, they are subordinated to a higher rhythm that regulates them in a dramatic fashion. Apparently, this apocatastatic move, if properly understood, is not related to national eschatology. However, one of Nahmanides' older contemporaries, Ha-Yovel ha-Gadol. This is a symbol of Binah, the third sefirah, which is conceived of as higher than the perimeter, namely the seven lower sefirot. This eighth sefirah is connected to the macrochronos of 49,000 years, or the cosmic Jubilee, a period in which, according to many Kabbalistic sources, the entire reality, including the seven lower sefirot, envisioned as sons, rises up to be absorbed into the great mother, understood here as the Jubilee.

May this be the will [of God] soon in our days."62 The Hebrew phrase translated as 'revolve in a cyclical manner's is Hozerim halilah and it seems that its use here bears the influence of a passage in Sefer Yetzfrah, ch. II, where it is said that the sphere, or circle, hozer halilah. A similar Hebrew phrase, galgal hozer ba 'olam,63 a circle or a sphere is constantly revolving in the world, also points to the ups and downs of the wheel of fortune and this phrase, too, might have contributed something to the above passage. However, it is only in Sefer Yetzirah that we find a more articulated concept of circularity. We would expect the circular expression to have something to do with a more comprehensive scheme, namely an astronomical pattern of return that would integrate history, or more precisely Jewish history, within a broader cosmic scheme. As it turns out, however, R. Yehudah ha-Kohen does not deal with the vicissitudes of life in general but rather with the specific return of the Jewish kingdom. Furthermore, unlike the more widespread eschatological Jewish theories, which view the redemption as the result of a divine plot or of a special intervention, here it is part of the way of the world, which is allegedly governed solely by the principle of the cosmic recurrence of events. From this point of view, the last passage fits in with the indifference of Jewish medieval philosophy to profane history; many Jewish philosophers underrated the possible intellectual status of historical events because of an obvious epistemological reason: the spiritual realm alone can be really known, while history deals with accidents. Maimonides, the paragon of Jewish medieval philosophers, considered the perusal of the history of the kings a futile activity. Though very close in many of his views to those of Maimonides and even active in their dissemination, Abraham Abulafia expressed quite a different attitude toward history. As seen above, he proposed an affinity between, on the one hand, the structure of the divine names and, on the other hand, the perception of the divine attributes by man (according to one passage) and the states of exile and redemption (according to another passage). Let me adduce an additional passage on this topic and analyze it in some detail: Behold, the renewal64 of the world will necessarily be in accordance with the [divine] attributes, and the attributes will, indubitably, be in 62 Printed by Colette Sirat, 'Juda b. Salomon Ha-Kohen — philosophe, astronome et peut-etre Kabbaliste de la premiere moitie du XHIe siecle,' Italia, I, no. 2 (1979), p. 48 n. 21. 63 See, e.g., BT, Shabbath, fol. 154b. 64 Hiddush ha- 'olam, This term should be understood in this context, as elsewhere in Abulafia's</page><page sequence="23">On Some Forms of Order in Kabbalah LIII accordance with the [divine] names. And the names will be revealed and concealed in accordance with the letters. And from this renewal, the ascent of a nation or nations will take place, as well as the decline of another nation or "nations".65 Let me start with the observation that although Abulafia mentions the ascent of a nation, he does not restrict his discussion by excluding the other nations from this ascent, for he immediately adds this possibility. Thus, though he plausibly had in mind the political ascent of the Jews, Abulafia is hardly a simple particularistic thinker, who merely interprets and expands earlier Jewish eschatological traditions. In Abulafia's integrated system, the national ascent depends on a cosmic renewal, which in turn depends on the divine attributes, which are governed by the divine names. This is also true, implicitly, insofar as the decline of nations is concerned. It is noteworthy, however, that for Abulafia, the divine will is not an important theological concept, and that the structure of divine names that are appointed over the divine attributes represents another form of order, which does not include the concept of voluntary divine intervention. It may be important to consider the relationship between names and letters, to which I've already alluded in the previous section. The given text suggests that the letters are higher than the names, just as the latter are higher than the divine attributes, which govern the stars, which in turn govern lower processes. The first three levels: the letters, the names, and the attributes, represent a descending hierarchy and are not only part of a formal analogy but correspond to the lower entities that depend on them. Let me address another instance of the subordination of a linear eschatological story, or order, to a cyclical cosmic theory. Late in the 16th century in Northern Africa, R. Isaac ben Abraham composed his Kabbalistic treatise Ginnat Bitan, where he assesses that The great purpose of the advent of the king Messiah and of the World to Come, [was not disclosed, as it is said66], "The heart did not disclose to the mouth," neither to the vulgus or to all of the elite but to the few ones who merit this [i.e. the knowledge of the secret]. It is forbidden to the recipient of this secret to disclose it even to the elite, other than to a friend exceptionally close to him. And in the year of Messiah, namely writings, as pointing not to creatio ex nihilo but to periodical renewal, as is the case with the moon: hiddush ha-levanah. 65 Otzar 'Eden Ganuz, Ms. Oxford-Bodleiana 1580, fol. 99b. 66 BT Sanhedrin, fol. 99a.</page><page sequence="24">LIV Moshe Idel in the year whose secret is 358 of the sixth millennium, which is the year, then the Messiah will arrive.67 [However] In an occult manner he has already arrived during the several cycles of the worlds which have already passed before the present one in which we are, since at the time that he has already arrived, at the very same time, he shall come again. And what is meant by 'and then he shall come' is that the Messiah will come in the future at the [same] time that he comes in our time, namely in our world.68 The Moroccan Kabbalist combines the linear vision of ancient Jewish eschatology, which assumes that the arrival of the Messiah will take place at a certain precise date, with the theory of the cosmic cycles, or Shemittot, which assumes concepts of time dealing with thousands of years as the basic unit. In each of these cosmic cycles, the Messiah will arrive in the same year, which according to the numerical value (358) of the letters forming the Hebrew word mashi'ah .(משיח) is the Jewish year five thousand three hundred fifty eight, thus corresponding to the Gregorian year 1598. Here, again, the broader framework with its particular logic, determined the more specifically Jewish topic, the advent of the Messiah, and dramatically changed its meaning. An additional conceptual change, which is presumably no less dramatic, is that no special eschatological task is assigned to human actions. This deterministic stand is hardly consonant with any of the biblical or Rabbinic forms of order as discussed above. In this section I have emphasized that the cosmic cycles have independent processes that follow the astral order. However, there are many cases in which the astral order has been accepted by Jewish authors in the context of astro magic and this led them to interpret the commandments as modes of drawing down the supernal powers, whether astral or divine. This combination of the astral order with the ritual order generates what I call the talismanic model.69 It should be mentioned that in many cases, in Kabbalah and in similar theories, like the Hindu ones, the theory of cosmic cycles surmises that nowadays the writer is living in the worst of those cycles. This is, indeed, quite a pessimistic and relatively passive worldview. Ha-MaShYaHthe numerical value of its consonants amounts to five thousand (the consonant He) and three hundred fifty-eight (Msh YH). Ginnat Bitan, ch. 52, Ms. Oxford-Bodleiana 1578, fol. 63b.

See Idel, Hasidism, pp. 65-81.</page><page sequence="25">On Some Forms of Order in Kabbalah LV ?.Concluding Remarks The conceptual differences between the three given forms of order are evident. The association of theurgy with the anthropomorphic order of power relies upon the isomorphism of two structures and puts a strong emphasis on the entire range of the Rabbinic percepts. In this case, a fuller human organism is involved and this involvement assumes a wider range of actions and effects. The linguistic order is dramatically related to one organ of the human body, namely the mouth, along with its verbal modes of operation, which are associated with such mental activities as thinking and imagining, and also, especially in Hasidism, with the realm of the emotions. The astrological order is not dependent on humans and their actions but has a strong impact on them. While the first sort of order may be described as the most theurgical and interactive, the second combines theurgy and magic, and the third is more magic-oriented and involves astro-magic or talismanics. This third mode, or astral organization, deserves a more extensive discussion elsewhere. It should, however, be mentioned that at different stages in the history of Kabbalah, astral stands have been absorbed within the different theosophical structures so that the mechanistic aspects of the original sources have been substantially attenuated. As a result of subordinating the astral order to the theosophical one, the flexibility of the latter was sometimes imposed on the former, whereas at other times it was the other way round, with the former being modified in accordance with the nature of the latter. Thus, for instance, we learn in one of R. Moses Cordovero,s writings that The matter of the changes of the times depends upon the supernal sefirot and the directive that reaches us from them. We are the people of God, [therefore] all our behavior and the revolutions of our times are counted by us exactly in accordance with the spheres of the sefirot,70 since the secret of our souls, spirits, and higher souls is that we are sparks hewn from the light of the sefirot and all our intention is to imitate the supernal [entities] as far as possible, to link ourselves to the supernal roots, to cleave to our Creator, as far as possible...and He arranged the seasons of the year and the motions of the stars in such a way as to enable us, by their signs, to know the supernal directives just as they are in the Land of Israel.71 70 Galgalei ha-sefirot.

On this book see now idem, 'On the Prayerbook Tefillah le-Moshe: Some Remarks,' Daat, vol. 44 (1999), pp. 59-84 (Hebrew).</page><page sequence="26">LVI Moshe Idel Let me draw attention to the assumption, recurrent in numerous texts ever since the beginning of theosophical Kabbalah, that a lower order is the starting point for understanding a higher order. The astral order presented in the given text reflects the theosophical order and mediates the transmission of power from above. This Kabbalist implies the existence of a certain intelligibility and isomorphism that is shared by the lower order and its supernal source.72 The phrase "the revolutions of our times" translates the Hebrew Gilgulei zemanenu, which is a pun on the term galgalim, spheres, which occurs immediately afterwards: the celestial world is imagined as a visible map, which enables one to read, symbolically, its invisible and higher divine counterpart. This subordination is part of a more comprehensive effort, apparent in theosophical Kabbalah, to impose the system of ten seflrot upon the astral order, and sometimes upon the philosophical theory of ten separate intellects, thereby creating a stratified picture of the universe. This strategy of subordination predates Cordovero by centuries,73 Let me return to another aspect of Cordovero's passage: the two forms of order, the theosophical and the astral, are conceived of as generative orders, namely as principles that impact the processes below. In this context, the occurrence of the term, hanhagah, "directive" or "guidance," is quintessential. The descending influx is not a matter of neutral, cosmic or universalistic processes, as in the different forms of philosophical orders. Rather, it is oriented in a very specific manner that is conceived of as the source of the Jewish rituals. This is a transformation of the supernal processes into a paradigm of the Jewish ritual. Thus, what happens de facto is the projection of the ritual order on both the astral and the theosophical ones. This is even more conspicuous since the order of the corporate personality is explicitly mentioned. The affinity is not only a matter of the higher order being imitated by the lower one, according to the view of the Kabbalist. De facto, it also derives from the assumption that the lower order is indeed controlling the higher; there is also an essential identity between the corporate personality and the divine substance, since the souls of the Jews are understood to be hewn from the divine realm. It should be observed that one of the terms for the theosophical order, maarakhah, which occurs in the title of a classic of theosophical See R. Isaac Sagi Nahor's Commentary on Sefer Yetzirah, as analyzed by Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah, pp. 274-275, 277. Compare, however, the claim of the non-intelligibility of the supernal orders according to Scholem and, following him, Joseph Dan. See Wasserstrom, Religion after Religion, pp. 93-95 and above, note 46 on my view of the ten sefirot as an exegetical code. See, especially in the writings of the mid-13th century Kabbalists: R. Isaac ben Jacob ha Kohen, his student R. Moses of Burgos, and R. Isaac of Acre.</page><page sequence="27">On Some Forms of Order in Kabbalah LVII theurgical Kabbalah, Ma'arekhet ha-'Elohut, stems from an astrological term, maarakhah, which in medieval Hebrew has the meaning of an astronomical constellation.74 Central for the main schools of theosophical-theurgical Kabbalah, since their very inception, is a process of describing the supernal orders in linguistic or ritualistic terms, like Torah, tefillah or mitzvah, thus creating forms of continua between the performance below and the order on high.75 In some of these integrated forms of order, theurgy and magic are given a substantial role, unlike the minor role given to the more classical astrological orders, even when accepted by Kabbalists, as is the case of the mid-14th century Sefer ha-Temunah. Failing to integrate the theurgical or magical aspects, the ritual and linguistic order lose their central role and Kabbalists may develop some propensity for antinomianism. Unlike the theory that attributes the emergence of antinomian tendencies in Kabbalah to its alleged Gnostic origins, my assumption is that astronomical and astrological orders, formulated in non-ritualistic modes of thinking and thus indifferent to the ritualistic orientations, significantly contributed to the emergence of antinomian conceptual phenomena in some forms of Kabbalah. To formulate it otherwise: a conflict between different forms of order, which became part of the same literature, created a tension that culminated, quite rarely to be sure, in antinomian views. Interestingly, as far as Polish Hasidism is concerned, since its inception it has preserved the linguistic order in a more substantial manner, while at the same time minimizing the anthropomorphic and the astral orders. We may describe the systemic history of Kabbalah as a series of interactions between earlier Jewish forms of order and new ones, with the latter stemming basically from Greek and Hellenistic sources as mediated by Arabic translations and writings. Those old and new orders interacted, competed, rose and declined, and the diverse processes in which they were involved may have captured a vital development of Kabbalistic literature which is no less important than the historicistic efforts to reduce its history solely to the impact of views found in the immediate vicinity of a certain Kabbalistic author, book or school. The expansion of performative religions, as the biblical and Rabbinic forms of Judaism are, into systemic elaborations of their rationales takes place by accumulating new sorts of order, which add theosophical, cosmic, astral, and psychological dimensions. This is perhaps the 74 I hope to deal with the various kabbalistic meanings of this term elsewhere. See also Abraham Elqayam, 'The Archytechtonic Structure of Sefer Ma'arekhet ha-'Elohut,' Qiriat Sefer, vol. 34 (1993), pp. 289-304 (Hebrew). 75 On this topic see Idel, Enchanted Chains.</page><page sequence="28">LVIII Moshe Idel quintessence of the major processes that generated the Kabbalistic literature. Those assimilated orders helped the Kabbalists organize the earlier Jewish material in new ways, which should be investigated along the lines proposed above. New organization of knowledge sometimes emerges as part of the disintegration of older forms of order, while in other cases it may strengthen them. Resort to analytic concepts, such as 'comprehensive symbols', 'forms of connectiveness', 'Gestalt-coherence', 'models and macro-models',76 'inter corporality' and 'intra-corporality',77 'arcanization' and 'de-arcanization',78 'subordination', 'synthesis', and 'eclecticism' will help explicating the basic conceptual organization of the complex writings of Kabbalists as thinkers in search of enhancing the meaning of their practice and beliefs — by treating them in ways that are different from the historical, historicistic, or history of ideas methods prevalent in most of Kabbalah scholarship. 76 See Idel, Hasidism, pp. 45-145. 77 For the last two concepts see Idel, Absorbing Perfections, pp. 250-256. 78 See ibid., passim.</page></plain_text>
