Oxford University Press, American Branch, 1925. $4.25. The Religious Thought of the Greeks from Homer to the Triumph of Christianity. By CLIFFORD HERSCHEL MOORE. Second edition. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1925. $4.00. Professor Nilsson has long been known to students of Greek religion as the author of Griechische Feste mit religioser Bedeutung, the most useful book in its field, as well as of several other important monographs and many short papers. The present work is especially welcome as a summing up of the author's views, and as a survey of Greek religious development from pre- historic times to the decadence. The title of the book is perhaps a little misleading. It is a reworking of a series of lectures on the history of Greek religion, and, probably because of that circumstance, it is not really a documented history-it rarely cites ancient authorities, literary or epigraphic, although the author makes acknowledgments to many modern investigators. The beautifully printed pages gain in appearance by the sparsity of references; but because of the lack of them, many of Mr. Nilsson's conclusions can be tested only by a specialist who controls the authorities as well as the writer himself. An appendix of twenty pages or thereabouts would have been enough to remedy this fault; and many readers will hope to see the defect supplied in another edition. For all that, the book is.by far the most stimulating and interesting that is available for the student. Particularly valuable is the first chapter, on "Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and its Survival in Greek Religion." The next three, "Origin of Greek Mythology," "Primitive Belief and Ritual," and "Gods of Nature and of Human Life," are marked by a virtue that deserves all praise, namely, openmindedness toward the contributions of anthropology and comparative religion, -coupled with a sane discrimination between what is sound and what is fanciful. In the account of "Homeric Anthropomorphism and Rationalism" the reviewer misses only a little more attention to the note of aristocratic sophistication, verging upon cynicism, which seems best to explain some peculiar passages in the epic. There are many original views which deserve attention in the remaining chapters, "Legalism and Mysticism," 83</page><page sequence="2">84 BOOK REVIEWS "The Civic Religion," and "The Religion of the Cultured Classes and the Religion of the Peasants," the last of which gives a vivid picture of the decay of the old worship. But it is scarcely worth while to particularize; the whole book is good, and for the serious student of the subject it is indispensable. Readers will naturally dissent from some of the author's opinions. What- ever may be true of the Oedipus of the folktale, not all will agree that the sufferings of Sophocles' Oedipus befall him "through no fault of his own" (p. 226); and the reviewer inclines to a somewhat different theory of certain votive offerings (p. 96). But these are small matters, and detract nothing from the general impression of able and honest interpretation which the book produces. The translation is excellent. Only rarely (e.g., at the bottom of p. 215) do we find an awkward or foreign-sounding turn of expression. Misprints are even harder to find; on page 95 site should be rite. The second edition of Professor C. H. Moore's Religious Thought of the Greeks is a reprint, in larger format, of the first (his Lowell Lectures, with some added material), with a few corrections and modifications of certain statements. Even the bibliography at the end remains substantially the same in spite of the lapse of eight years between the two printings. The references to encyclopedic works have been brought down to date, but very few additions, if any, have been made. However, the author had limited his study to the higher expressions of Greek religious thought, which have been least touched by the results of recent investigations; and his lucid r6sume still remains a most useful aid to the student. There is, therefore, little to criticize. It may be regretted that the personal turns of expression which are a part of the lecturer's method have been allowed to stand in this second edition-Professor Nilsson's book follows a better plan in this respect: and one reader, at least, confesses to entertaining the perhaps ungracious, yet irrepressible, wish that Professor Moore had found time to give us a new book rather than a reprint of the old one.
