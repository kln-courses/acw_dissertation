That thing you perceive is a shadow of a reflected image: it has nothing of its own; with you it goes and remains. quod petis, est nusquam; quod amas, avertere, perdes! ista repercussae, quam cernis, imaginis umbra est: nil habet ista sui; tecum venitque manetque. . . . Ovid, Met. 3.433-5.' 1. Introduction. When in the Metamorphoses Narcissus discovers himself in the waters of a clear pool, falls in love with himself, and then descends into a lower world of perpetual self-gazing, he lives through an experience that expresses not only Ovid's preoccupations but also something very basic to his culture, and hence to ours. The prophecy of Tiresias, that the youth will live until he knows himself, ironically identifies 1 In this essay authors and titles of classical works are abbreviated where possible according to the Oxford Classical Dictionary (1970).

It thus brings into question an ancient rule of conduct and Socratic summum bonum;2 it suggests that instead of the regulated or fulfilled life, the pursuit of self-knowledge can lead to an intolerable, self-destructive vision. When Ovid used mirroring as the nuclear metaphor of this perilous knowledge, he was following as well as molding conventional practice, for which his story of Narcissus became in turn a primary source. In Christian culture, St. Paul's portrayal of fallen vision, "by means of a mirror in a riddle" (δι* έσόπτρου έν αΐνίγματι, 1 Cor 13:12), gave this story and its relations an explicit place in the biblical framework as analogies to the Fall of Man. The question of what is meant by "mirroring" is thus an interesting and consequential one. Its reso nances in Western literature are impossible to delimit. Like metaphor itself, mirroring both identifies and separates. In antiquity it refers to an event in which a thing finds itself in or as another, but simultaneously it presupposes the otherness of the mir ror, hence of the beholder's mirrored selfhood. As Plato observes in the Sophist, mirror-images share with semblances of all kinds an ambiguous mixture of being and nonbeing (240a). Indeed, the mirror ing vision is precisely something that is there yet also not there, hence it challenges the mentality that thinks in terms of here and there, or self and not-self. Being ontologically ambiguous as well as fascinating, it is also a trap for the unwary. The purpose of this essay is to describe a taxonomy of mirror ing primarily on the basis of classical literary evidence and so to clarify the context of Ovid's influential telling of the Narcissus myth. I do not discuss this myth directly, important though it is to the subsequent literary history of mirroring; rather, I provide a hypothetical recon struction of what might plausibly have been available to a poet of Ovid's time. I attempt to give a notoriously elusive metaphor a defi nite shape. Indeed, the boundaries of the catoptric metaphor (f. Gk. κάτοπτρον, mirror) are not easy to determine. In attributing catop tric properties to the things of the world or to the world itself, the meta 2 Walter Burkert 1985.148 points out that this commandment was intended originally to mean "know that you are not a god," i.e., know your limits.

For pragmatic reasons I restrict my investigations here to passages in which the words for "mirror" are found,3 though the taxonomy I derive from these occurrences is generally applicable. To illustrate this generality, I will conclude the essay with a brief look at two stories in which the catop tric metaphor is implicit. My study is based on the assumption that a reading of any catoptric story from antiquity (such as the myth of Narcissus) is skewed if we assume modern attitudes conditioned by the omnipres ence of glass mirrors and psychoanalytic theories. Rather, it asks what the people of the classical period thought about seeing themselves, both physically and figuratively, as objective images. Because the aim is literarv. however, it is concerned not so much with the nature of catoptric experience as with its metaphorical structure; thus his torical and scientific sources (such as Pliny) are consistently read from a poetic perspective. Since the aim is Narcissus, and beyond that the literature influenced by his story, certain aspects of the metaphor will receive proportionally greater emphasis than would be the case in a more general study, but all are represented. Studies of Narcissus tend to mention the importance of mirror ing but not to consider it in any detail (e.g., Eitrem 1935.1727-9; Skinner 1965; Cancik 1967.42-5). Mirroring itself has been studied for other sance literature (1982), and by Norbert Hugedé for the Pauline tradition (1957); its psychoanalytic implications repeatedly explored (Roheirn 1919; Elkisch 1957); its place in semiotics questioned (Eco 1986); its archaeological and historical contexts thoroughly examined (Schefold 1940; Karouzou 1951; Congdon 1981; Thomson deGrummond 1982a); and its literary and artistic history surveyed (von Netoliczka 1921). None of these, however, has focussed on the catoptric metaphor as such in classical literature, our earliest formative source. It is this gap that the present study seeks to fill. For this essay I looked at occurrences of speculum up to and including Apuleius and most occurrences of κάτοπτρον, εσοπτρον, and ενοπτρον. For the Latin references I am indebted to Professor Dr. Viktor Poschl, Universitàt Heidelberg, and Dr. Ursula Keudel, Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (Munchen); for the Greek references the The saurus Linguae Graecae, available to me on CD-ROM by means of an Ibycus micro computer.</page><page sequence="4">164 Willard McCarty 2. General Structure. To begin with, metaphorical uses of mirroring in our period can be sorted roughly into two categories. The first emphasizes the indi rectness of mirroring, hence its illusory nature, and is characteristic of the Platonic tradition. In Plato, for example, like other forms of representation mirroring attests to perceptual habits of the unawakened mind.4 Indeed, to the Platonist wisdom consists of turning from all sensible reflections of ideal form, which have no intrinsic value, to the ideas themselves. For obvious reasons, this tradition has contributed very little to the development of the metaphor except the important equation of mirroring with deception and with ordinary, unenlightened consciousness. Platonic mirroring is thus related to the biblical and hence Pauline idea that fallen perception, which yields but "puzzling y» rr»r*\ îtiiçvuuiia m α iimiui \nuuj, is xiuaixj ιυ υυ αι/aiiuuuvu. χι uuins crucially, however, in that until the last day the mirror of fallen vision is its inescapable medium: "For now (άρτι) we see through a glass, darkly; but then (τότε) face to face: now (άρτι) I know in part; but then (τότε) shall I know even as also I am known."5 In contrast to the metaphors in the first category, those in the second are not primarily representational but visionary. As in the Pauline tradition, these metaphors imply an ineluctably catoptric world, but they presuppose no time when man will turn away from the mirror and see "face to face." Because mirroring is fundamental to this world, the metaphor represents what is ultimately real, namely the psycho spiritual significance of phenomena. This sort of mirror tells the truth. The significance it reveals is, according to the metaphor, not projected onto phenomena; indeed, mirroring in this sense is to be distinguished from the modern idea of projection, according to which a self-image is See, e.g., the discussion of poetry and mimetic representation in Rep. 10; and esp. 7.514 sqq. (the allegory of the cave); cf. Augustine's allusion in Conf. 4.16.30. See also Plato on shadows and reflections (Rep. 3.402b, 6.510a, 10.596e); on the indirect ness of theoretical speculation (Phaedo 99d-100a; cf. Plut., Quaest. conv. 8.2.718e; Sen., QNat 1.17.2); on the body (Phaedo 65); on beauty cf. P\\iX.,Amat. 765b, f; Quaest. conv. 5.672e. Cf. Hugedé 1957.115-36. Kittel 1964a argues that "to see in a glass" means "to see prophetically," but Weiss 1910.319 points out that the context is eschatological. The Pauline mirror is thus consistent with the typological relationship between history and revelation, which is characteristic of the Bible but not of classical culture.</page><page sequence="5">The Shape of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 165 unconsciously placed in the external world.6 In contrast, mirroring focuses on finding the self in the not-self and tends (contemporary optical theory excluded) to leave in silence the means by which it got there. Hence, the catoptric vision is either the inescapable means or is itself the revelation. This revelation has a fourfold structure that I would like to describe abstractly before we get to details. At the basis of the structure is the irreconcilable polarity that I mentioned at the beginning. Ac cordingly, a mirror establishes a paradoxical relationship of corre spondence and opposition between beholder and external things. On the one hand it involves him intimately in something not himself, on the other it separates his selfhood from himself and thus objectifies it. As we will see, this intimate connection with objective reality leads in positive circumstances to ecstatic union of the self and not-self, but negatively to entrapment; while the objectification of the self leads positively to self-development or "individuation," negatively to a destructive confrontation with the psychic forces thus hypostatized. Later in my argument I will show that this polarity has a sexual form which is responsible for the erotic associations characteristic of mir roring throughout our period. 3. A Natural History of Mirrors. The physical properties of mirrors in antiquity and the social attitudes towards them are worth considering because they help us to understand the coherence of the metaphor and so to interpret its sig nificance in the various contexts in which it occurs. They are not so much foreign to us as commonly overlooked. The following is intended to be a kind of historical reminder. By far the most fundamental fact about a mirror is that it shows you what you cannot otherwise see, your own appearance. From this follows the primary emphasis of the catoptric metaphor in antiquity on the psycho-spiritual significance of external phenomena. If in a 6 The Oxford English Dictionary defines "projection" as the process by which "a mental figure or image [is] visualized and regarded as an objective reality." Note the exten sive use of this idea in Dodds 1951, and cf. Elkisch 1957.238, who calls mirroring "the screen for man's projections of the mysterious and the uncanny." In both cases projection is assumed rather than discussed, although there are no words in either Greek or Latin corresponding to "projection" in this sense.</page><page sequence="6">166 Willard McCarty catoptric world "to reflect" means "to reflect the self' then the ordinary world is, beneath appearances, an inner world. Since the mirror is the only means of seeing the physical self, it is apt to be considered a visionary device. Some modern scholars have assumed that the use of the metaphor to represent distorted or derivative vision, as in Platonic thought, indicates the ancients' dis satisfaction with the optical quality of their mirrors (contra Kittel 1964a. 179; Weiss 1910.319 η. 1). Quite the contrary. Although dis torting mirrors were known,7 metaphorical usage indicates that the ancients regarded their mirrors chiefly as devices that would expand or intensify vision, not attenuate or falsify it (cf. Plut., De Pyth. or. 404d). Indeed, the primary words for "mirror" in Latin and Greek (speculum, κάτοπτρον) are derived from the roots of verbs of seeing, so that iden tification or confusion is possible;8 and the use of mirroring to repre sent cognition itself, which we still call "reflection," was well estab lished in classical times.9 Describing the ideal historian, for example, Lucian declares: Above all, let him bring a mind like a mirror, clear, gleam ing-bright, accurately centred, displaying the shapes of things just as he receives them, free from distortion, false colouring, or misrepresentation (Hist, conscr. 51). Μάλιστα δέ κατόπτρφ έοικυΐαν παρασχέσθω τήν γνώμην άθόλω και στιλπνω και άκριβεΐ τό κέντρον και οποίας αν δέξηται τάς μορφάς των έργων ταΰτα και δεικνύτω αύτά, διάστροφον δέ ή παράχρουν ή έτερόσχημον μηδέν. E.g., Sext. Emp., Pyr. 1.48f.; Diog. Laert. 5.4.66; Sen., QNat. 1.5.14, 1.6.2. For L. speculum cf. specula, a "look-out" or "watch-tower" and various derivatives of specio, and see Varro, Ling. 5.29.129, 6.82. For Gk. κάτοπτρον cf. κάτοπτος, "be visible," etc., and see Pl. Cra. 414cd. Cf. note 25, below. This begins with the Timaeus, where the liver is the inner mirror by which the mind perceives its own possibilities and prophesies in dreams what is to come (71a-72d); note, however, that the liver belongs to the appetitive part of the soul, which under stands only images and phantoms and requires the assistance of reason to interpret them. Cf. Plut,,De Is. et Os. 384a; Quaest. conv. 8.10.736b; Philo, spec. leg. 1.39.219; Grabes 1982.131. Note the idea of "reflection" in John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding 2.1.4, and cf. Gibson 1960.55-7.</page><page sequence="7">The ShaDe of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 167 An ancient mirror (of highly polished metal, usually bronze) would differ from its modern counterpart in glass primarily by being generally smaller, usually circular, convex, and (if bronze or gold) warm in color — not by giving a significantly less desirable image.10 The most important difference, I think, is the comparative scarcity of mirroring in the ancient world. Under natural conditions, standing water can be an adequate medium, but these could not have been common for the urban authors and their audience; and until the prosperity of the Pax Romana only the very wealthy could afford artificial mirrors, which even then were rare by modern standards (Lloyd-Morgan 1982.39). The novelty of mirroring and the conse quent intensity of its impact are suggested, for example, by the fact that Apuleius, in the middle of the second century A.D., felt the need to defend himself against the charge of possessing a mirror and to itemize in enthusiastic detail its virtues as a means of self-repre sentation, hence self-knowledge (Apol. 13-16; cf. OCD). His defense is not gratuitous; literary and archaeological evidence confirms that until quite late mirrors were conventionally restricted in their use, chiefly to women for erotic or related purposes,11 to worshippers as votive offerings, and to the bereaved as female grave-furniture.12 They had, that is, a fairly specialized, and for that reason propor tionally intensified significance. See Grabes 1982.72. Glass mirrors were known in antiquity but little used; see Pliny, HN 36.66.193; Schefold 1940.15f.; Lloyd-Morgan 1982.47f. Note the principal association of mirrors with Aphrodite-Venus (sometimes in con trast to Athena); see Apul., Met. 4.31; Ath. 15.687c; Callim. 5.17-22 and Bulloch 1985.130; Claud., nupt.

The association with women and erotic intent is also suggested by the decorations on surviving mirrors, for which see Thomson de Grummond 1982d. 168ff. ; Thomson de Grummond and Hoff 1982.34-8; Lambert 1982.177.

As Thomson de Grum mond suggests, citing L. Valerius' defense of female adornment in Livy, a woman's use of a mirror implied the creation and maintenance not merely of her status in the world but of the mundus muliebris itself, created in this life and the next by an act of adornment in which mir roring played an intimate role.14 The nature of this role becomes clearer when we note that although use of mirrors by men was usually condemned,15 the adornment of the inward man often adopted the metaphor if not the philosophical use of an actual mirror. Plutarch, for example, declared that he used "history as a mirror, endeavoring in a manner to fashion and adorn my life in conformity with the virtues therein depicted (ωσπερ έν εσοπτρω τη ιστοριςι πειρωμενον αμως γέ πως κοσμεΐν και άφομοιοϋν πρός τάς έκείνων άρετάς τόν βίον, Vit. Aem. 1). Thus, von Vacano notes, because the mirror bestowed the power to arrange and present the self, it became the instrument "by means of which a personality was created and a soul could be con jured up" (1960.8).16 Exemplary mirroring as a whole is based on this Socratic notion that individuation is a process of self-discovery. In the dedication of his essay de Clementia, for example, Seneca declares 13 See Karouzou 1951.582. We can suppose that this is the usual attitude from the fact that among the gods coition always results in progeny. 14 Thomson de Grummond 1982e. 180-2 notes that both Gk. κόσμος and L. mundus combine the ideas of "ornament" and "world"; Livy 34.7.9. 15 When used by men the mirror usually implies effeminacy or degeneracy; see Eur., Or. Ill If.; Dion. Hal., Ant. Rom. 7.9; Diog. Laert. 7.17; Gell., NA 6.12.5; Juv. 2.99 101; Lucian, Pise. 45; Macrob., Sat. 3.13.4; Mart. 9.16; Sen., QNat. 1.17.10 (who links the development of artificial mirrors with vice generally); Tert., De cultu fem. 2.8; and cf. Apul., Apol. 13f. Thomson de Grummond 1982d. 172 points out that one inscription on an Etruscan mirror "suggests that males did at least buy mirrors," though they were intended for women. 16 Cf. Fry 1980.55. Suetonius reports two illustrative examples: of Caligula, who prac tised "before a mirror all sorts of terrible and fearsome expressions" to make his appearance even more savage than it already was (vultum vero natura horridum ac taetrum etiam ex industria efferabat componens ad speculum in omnem terrorem ac formidinem, 50.1); and of Augustus, who just before he died, "calling for a mirror... ordered his hair combed and falling jaw straightened" (petito speculo capillum sibi comi ac malas labantes corrigi praecepit, 2.99).</page><page sequence="9">The Shape of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 169 to Nero that he wrote it "so that I may perform in a way the function of a mirror and so reveal you to yourself' (ut quodam modo speculi vice fungerer et te tibi ostenderem) in the hope that Nero will find himself reflected in the image of mercy, hence it in himself, and thus become merciful (1.1; cf. Philo, de Jos. 16.54.87; Pl., Phdr. 255cd). Two prop erties of the physical device are significant to the metaphor here: its responsiveness, mirroring the observer, change for change, in time;17 and objectification, capturing his changeable image in space and thus seeming to give it an almost independent being. Creating a per sonality would, then, be an interactive process: not simply adopting an external image as the self, but discovering the self by correspon dence with an external world in which the observer finds himself mirrored. The result is an objectified soul, a personality provoked from without and "conjured up" from within. The metaphor of the objectified self that results from or is dis covered by mirroring deserves a closer look. As von Vacano points out, the reflected image, like the shadow, qualifies perfectly as a form of the soul, having "all the attributes of the body except the crucial one of tangibility" (1960.8).18 Frazer likewise notes the widespread belief that a man's soul is "in his reflection in water or in a mirror,'"9 and in a curious but telling variant of this theme, Pausanias describes a mirror in an Arcadian temple of the Mistress, which would reflect a worshipper dimly, if at all, but would show the divine images and throne very clearly (8.37.4). Thus a mirror could easily be considered a spiritual medium, "a means of access and a bridge to other worlds and a vehicle for the transport of souls" (von Vacano 1960.9). Divi nation by use of mirrors (catoptromancy) or, sometimes, of water (hydromancy) likewise suggest the spirituality of the ancient mirror.20 " This is observed, e.g., by Apul., Apol. 13f.; Lucr. 4.166-7; Sen., QNat 1.4.2, 1.6.4. Aristotle connects responsiveness of mirrors with female menses (an image of mu tability), in De somn. 2.459b-460a; cf. Pliny, HN 7.15.64, 28.23.82, who includes bared teeth, 11.64.170. Marmorstein 1932.39 notes this effect of menses in Jewish tradition; cf. Fry 1980.55. 18 Cf. the shades of the dead in Od. 11 and elsewhere; the death-scene of Glauce in Eur., Med. 1159-62: arranging her hair in a mirror she smiles at her own "spiritless body" (δψυχον είκώ . . . σώματος) there.

Eur., Hec. 925f.). Though, as far as I know, this metaphor is unique in the literature and barely exploited by Lucretius himself, it captures perfectly the predominant sense of mirroring in antiquity: more than anything else a kind of visionary window into an invisible or inaccessible world, of the self or, by ex tension, of interior or spiritual things (cf. Philo, Abr. 153). It may not be merely fortuitous that Lucretius' metaphor also reproduces the circumstance of the individual self-consciousness, peering out through the eyes from the bony house of the skull into a world reachable only through the senses. Thus, paradoxically, the metaphor suggests not only access to the interior world of essences but also entrapment with in the limits of the self. The visionary window I spoke of may even be turned on some thing other than the observer, revealing its essence: thus of nature Cicero remarks that in children it is "discerned as in a mirror" (ut in speculis natura cernitur, Fin. 5.22.61; cf. 2.10.32), and Plutarch that it has "nowhere else so small a mirror of greater and nobler enterprises" than the industriousness of the ant (ούδέν γαρ ούτω μικρόν ή φύσις εχει μειζόνων και καλλιόνων κάτοπτρον, De soil. an. 967d). Not the 21 TU~ — this usage may be traced to the fact that at close distance all reflectors command a wide view as well as seem to contain it. This is especially true of ancient mirrors, which were often convex, as I mentioned earlier. They were manufactured this way probably because the metals and working methods of antiquity made large mirrors prohibitive. To circumvent the restricted view of the necessarily small mirror, artisans resorted to an optical trick, familiar to us from wide-angle lenses, of using a convex surface to compress a large scene into a small space.22 It seems likely that for this reason the corresponding metaphor would "epitomize" or concentrate the reflected world into a repre sentative, even paradigmatic microcosm, and so express its essence.23 21 Cf. Cic., Pis. 71; Arist., Rh. 3.3.4; Lucian, Ver. hist. 1.26; Pl., Leg. 10.905b; Grabes 1982.42f. calls this the "encyclopaedic mirror." 22 Grabes 1982.43; Thomson de Grummond and Hoff 1982.32; Schefold 1940.16. 23 Though concave mirrors are opposite in shape and, we would assume, entirely in effect, they also were thought to have a concentrating function, e.g., by Pliny, HN</page><page sequence="11">The Shape of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 171 Interestingly, convex mirroring must have been known from earliest times, since the surface of the eye has just this shape and was com monly observed to be a mirror. Pliny, for example, notes that the eye is so perfect a mirror that "the small pupil reflects the entire image of a man" (parva ilia pupilla totam imaginem reddat hominis, 11.55.148; cf. Pl., Ale. 1.132d-133b). Indeed, Latin pupilla means in origin "little girl," just as the corresponding Greek term, κόρη, means "maiden, daughter" (cf. Plut., De fac. 27.942d). In Greek romance and in the mysteries this image took on the pneumatic significance we might expect.24 The numinosity of mirroring is thus consistent with its natural history. As we have seen, the basis for this quality of the catoptric metaphor rests on two related powers of the physical device — first, lininiiplv Ia rpttpol fVlΑ ΚαΙιαΜογ'ο Κλ/^ιΚι calf in tViic mou t/-\ nllniir Vtim to conjure a personality, and through it a world, by interaction be tween his hidden self and external things; and second, to concentrate a proportionally large segment of the visible world into a small space, so to epitomize it, hence capture its essence. Metaphorically, then, the mirror is potentially epiphanic and thus perilous, the domain of "the mysterious and the uncanny" (Elkisch 1957.238). The etymology of the English word "mirror" (f. OF. mirour, L. mirare, to look at, wonder) is a reminder of that psychological fact. I suggested earlier that according to the basic polarity of mir roring, the catoptric numen could be either positive or negative. Let us now look briefly at the positive aspects of the metaphor in prepa ration for a more detailed examination of its negative potential, where our guiding focus on Narcissus would take us. 4. Positive Mirroring, Mystical and Moral. To the mystic, Titus Burckhardt comments, "the mirror is in fact the most immediate image of spiritual vision, contemplatio, and in 37.16.64; elsewhere he mentions specula concava used to start fires (2.111.239). This use of concave mirrors is attributed to Archimedes as early as Diodorus (26.18.1); a later tradition, beginning with Galen, is noted by Dijksterhuis 1957.28 f. See also Apul., Apol. 16; Pliny, HN 33.45.128-130; Gell., NA 16.18; Thomson de Grummond 1982b.26. See, e.g., the union of lovers through the reflected images in their eyes in Achil. Tat. 1.9.4; cf. 5.13.4. For later literature, see Grabes 1982.88; cf. 83-6; Ogle 1913.130-40. In the mysteries the reflected image in the eye, the κόρη, was an image of the soul that departed with or just prior to death (Eisler 1966.371 and n. 2).</page><page sequence="12">172 Willard McCarty general of perception, for through it the equation of subject and object is visualized."25 Correspondence becomes ecstatic union and thus opposition is transcended when the mystic finds his true self mirrored in the divine being and is transfigured, like the Pauline worshipper "changed into the same image from glory to glory" (την δόξαν κυρίου κατοπτριζόμενοι την αυτήν εικόνα μεταμορφούμεθα από δόξης εις δόξαν, 2 Cor 3:18). There is little of this in classical literature,26 but its moral equivalent occurs throughout in the numerous examples of the exemplary function by which mirroring admonishes or inspires the observer to reform himself. (What in the mystical tradition is an atemporal transformation becomes in the moral realm a temporal process of conforming the self to an exemplary model.) "For as the one teacheth how to attire the outwarde bodie," Thomas Salter re marks many centuries later, "so the other guideth to garnishe the inwarde mynde, and maketh it meete for vertue" (1579).27 Even a negative example, such as one own's face distorted by anger or by accident of birth, in this context implicitly holds up a positive model, here the self-controlled or inwardly beautiful man with which the be holder may identify. In the exemplary tradition, the mirror normally does not threaten, however sternly it may admonish; there is seldom a sense of peril beyond the failure to conform. In some cases, however, it may hint at something deeper, and closer to our concerns. Seneca, for example, observes that it is good for an angry man to see himself in "der Spiegel ist in der Tat das unmittelbarste Sinnbild der geistigen Schau, der con templatio, und ganz allgemein der Erkenntnis, denn durch ihn wird die Angleichung von Subjekt und Objekt veranschaulicht" (1960.12; cf. Kittel 1964b.696). For the use of mirroring in the context of spiritual visions, see esp. 2 Cor 3:18, where Paul appears to be alluding to Moses' vision of God on Sinai (Ex 33:18-23; 34:29-35; Num 12:8); Conzelmann 1969.268 points out that the possibility of pointing mar'eh ("sight, appearance") as mar'ah ("mirror") led to the Rabbinic interpretation of Num 12:8 as implying that Moses saw God in a clear mirror, subsequent prophets in a cloudy one. Grabes 1982.75, 139 traces the metaphor of the divine mirror from Alcibiades 1.133c to the Neoplatonists, Hellenistic mystics, and the early Christian Fathers. See Grabes 1982.48-61, 136-8. In this tradition the subject's appearance is contrasted with his moral character (Diog. Laert. 2.33 and 3.39; Apul., Apol. 15; Sen., QNat 1.17.1-4; Ira 2.36.1-3; Phaed. 8; Plut., De tranq. anim. 456b; cf. Philo, Moses 2.27. 136-140; migr. Abr. 17.98); or externals are said to function as exemplary mirrors (Plut., Vit. Aem. 1; De rec. rat. aud. 42b; Cic., Rep. 2.52.69; Sen., Clem. 1.1; Ter., Ad. 414-16, 428-9; PlautEp. 382-6; Philo, Jos. 16.54.87; Clem. Al., div. salv. 21).</page><page sequence="13">The Shape of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 173 a mirror; the great change in appearance alarms him, because it brings him up against an unsuspected, inner reality (velut in rem praesentem adducti non agnoverunt se, Ira 2.36.1-3). Seneca goes on to speculate that if the soul were visible, its intense ugliness would bewilder us (nos confunderet). Here, indeed, we no longer have a man's response, positive or negative, to a temporal model but his confrontation with something essentially atemporal and epiphanic, a sudden, surprising, and potentially threatening vision that precipitates a temporal re sponse. 5. Negative Mirroring. When manifested negatively, as a numinous power, the funda mental catoptric polarity of correspondence and opposition takes form as entrapment and repulsion, respectively. On the one hand, con temporary optical theory held that mirror-images are emanations retained in the mirror from reflected bodies (Sen., QNat. 1.5.1; cf. 1.12.1; Aet., De plac. 2.894). When this idea combined with the spiri tuality of the image, the mirror became a kind of spirit-trap,28 especially in folklore, and thus Eisler refers to "the magical power of the mirror image to ensnare the soul of living creatures" ("die zauberische Anziehungskraft des Spiegelbildes auf die Seele eines Wesens," 1966. 99). On the other hand, the mirror obviously deflects radiated power as well as reflects images, so that, as we will see, it was thought to ward off evil by turning aside harmful influence, like an amulet or other apotropaic device (see Riess 1894; Jessen 1896; Kiihnert 1909). 5.1 Labyrinthine Entrapment. In a well-known Orphic myth, the Titans use a mirror against Dionysus like a decoy or trap, to distract or paralyze the child-god so that they may destroy him,29 and elsewhere we read about mirrors 28 See, e.g., Ar., Nub. 749-52, where the moon, drawn down by a Thessalian witch, is shut up, as if it were in a mirror; Stat., Silv. 3.4.97f., where Venus' image is imprisoned in an ancient compact-mirror, speculum reclusit imagine rapta. " See Nonnos, Dion. 6.169-73; Clem. Al., Protr. 2.15; cf. Grabes 1982.150; Eisler 1966. 97-100, 167f. Burkert 1985.298 notes that although it is not attested in the pre-Hel lenistic epoch, "yet there are numerous indirect indications that the myth was well known."</page><page sequence="14">174 Willard McCarty used similarly to capture animals.30 Why the mirror should be thought to have this retentive power is illustrated though not explained by the contemporary optics and superstitions I have cited. To get to the root of the matter in literary terms, however, we must seek whatever essential affinity there may be between the imagery of mirroring and that of entrapment, for which the primary metaphor is the maze or labyrinth.31 The complexities of this metaphor are well beyond my scope, but for present purposes I will define its negative manifestation simply as the universal figure of the "path" or "way" twisted into an image of confused, regressive movement that entraps because it has no end but stasis. Like the mirror, the labyrinth originates in a para doxical negation: it is a path that, literally going nowhere, is essentially pathless. Most familiar are the fixed graphic or architectural labyrinths, such as buildings identified as labyrinths in antiquity or the represen tation of the Cretan labyrinth that Aeneas encounters on the temple doors at Cumae. For present purposes we may regard these as solidified movement,32 which the victim is forced to repeat physically or beguiled to repeat imaginatively and is thus trapped. Catoptric fascination works in much the same way. As Apuleius noted, the mirror fasci nates precisely because, unlike the statue or portrait, it offers the beholder the exact and immediate repetition of his changes and move mpntc (It ic thnc tr* hp HictinonichpH frnm ctatir nnrtraik anH mnrp generally, from relationships of purely spatial correspondence.) Thus the labyrinth compels its victim to follow fixed movements, the mirror to establish a sequence that is just as rigidly followed. Yet because the fixed path is really no path at all, we may extend the idea of the labyrinth to encompass the undetermined path, "error" in its etymo logical sense of aimless "wandering." This is even more catoptric, since the mirror offers no leadership, only temptation to further un directed movement. Then, too, since movement can be a metaphor of See, e.g., Ath. 9.42, 48; Claud., rapt. Proserp. 3.36.263-8; Ael., NA 17.25 and Diod. 17.90.2-3; cf. Eisler 1966.97f. I specifically exclude here the labyrinth in its positive manifestation, for which the clue is known. In his authoritative study, Kern argues that historically the dance of the labyrinth is probably older than any building of that kind and, more importantly for us, that the building and the dance form are two aspects of the same idea (1983.49-51; cf. 13, 30 f., 109f.).</page><page sequence="15">The Shape of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 175 thought, indeed of being, the labyrinth can be regarded as the outer form of the victim's inner state, his confusion of mind. Thus we can speak of the catoptric labyrinth and the labyrinthine mirror. Let us consider more closely the primary example of a graphic labyrinth in classical literature, the representation left by Daedalus on the temple-doors at Cumae, to which I have referred. Just before his hero's catabasis, Virgil forces us to dwell with Aeneas on the liminal picture, from which he briefly narrates the story of the Cretan Laby rinth. Critics have dealt variously with this episode, in recent years with an increasing awareness of the catoptric complexities that both join and separate Aeneas and Daedalus.33 In terms of mirroring, the Greek artisan's contrasting failures are significant, for Daedalus is profoundly mirrored in the labyrinths he habitually makes and tends ιο oe ensnareu oy. inueeu, uaeuaius ana nepnaesius, nis aivine double, are makers of marvellous things that fascinate the beholder, many of these by imitating life in an almost catoptric sense; but, as Eliade points out, these mythical artisans are above all master binders (1978a.266; cf. Burkert 1985.167f.). We may well wonder if at the core of this fascination is again a kind of mirroring: the manifestation in objective space of a self-image and the consequent enslavement to it. The labyrinthine image clearly reflects the Daedalian mentality, but the point of the ekphrasis is missed if we fail to notice the curious fact of Theseus' conspicuous absence (Clark 1979.150). With mir roring in mind, is it not then possible to see that the missing Hero of E.g., Norden 1957.120 rescues this ekphrasis from the charge of irrelevance only to find its connection with the poem weak; Pôschl 1962.149f. recognizes the catoptric qualities of the engraving, arguing that Aeneas is mirrored in Daedalus; Otis 1963. 284f. likewise, that Aeneas "gazes at his own past. . . symbolically disguised" in the depicted scenes; Eichholz 1968.111 points out that Daedalus "is what Aeneas is not and must not be, a genius who failed" (cf. 108-110); and finally, Fitzgerald 1984 studies the relationship between these figures in much finer detail. Apollodorus, for example, reports three such incidents in the life of Daedalus: his construction of the wooden cow for the estrous Pasiphae, a deceptive outer shell of the Cretan queen's corporeal "labyrinth," at the core of which the Minotaur is conceived; the labyrinth he builds to house the Minotaur, in which he and his son are imprisoned by wrathful Minos; the court of Cocalus [Gk. Κώκαλος] where he remains undiscovered until clever Minos reveals him by means of a challenge to thread a "spiral shell" [Gk. κόχλος], which he cannot forbear doing successfully (3.15.8, Ep. 1.12-15). Cf. Fitzgerald's point that "the central theme of this ekphrasis [in the Aeneid] is Daedalus' relation to his own constructs" (1984.54).</page><page sequence="16">176 Willard McCarty the Labyrinth is supplied by Aeneas, the beholder of this catoptric scene, in his mind? that Aeneas, who is clearly fascinated, sees him self in the scene and, preparing to descend into a subterranean ana logue of the labyrinth,35 is so caught in the false parallel with Theseus that he is turned aside once more from his Roman destiny until the Sibyl gruffly rescues him? She pays no attention to the deception, but a detailed study would show that Aeneas' catabasis contrasts in several ways with Theseus'.36 The point here, however, is that the parallel is not simply false: Aeneas, with the Sibyl's help, must make it so by breaking free from the catoptric fascination exerted by the labyrinth, hence by his Greek precursors. 5.2 Eros. To the relationship between mirroring and entrapment, a third element offers itself, namely eros. This is suggested first by the un ambiguous evidence of the literature and the artwork on surviving mirrors, and second by the fact that people have always used mirrors to improve their appearance for sexually motivated reasons. In this study, however, we must make sense of the evidence by asking if eros 35 Consider the juxtaposition of the engraving with Aeneas' catabasis and the labyrin thine character of the lower world he encounters, especially Tartarus (Aen. 6.548 ff.); cf. Clark 1979.148-50; Fitzgerald 1984.53). Several of the buildings identified as lab yrinths were in fact subterranean; see Pliny, HN 36.19.84-9; P. Mela 1.9.56; Callist., Ek. l;cf.Kern 1983.43, 48 f.; Otis 1963.284 η. 2. In the 12th century Eustathius could confidently declare that the labyrinth was "that underground Cretan cave with many turnings" (λαβύρινθος δέ σπήλαιον εκείνο ύπόγεων Κρητικόν πολυέλικτον, 1825.421, on Od. 9.321-5). As Kern notes, the journey into the labyrinth is essen tially a catabasis (1983.26-8); cf. Clark 1979.142; Rykwert 1976.151. 36 Both, for example, descend to save their people, though Theseus harrows a chthonic prison and kills its dweller, whereas Aeneas gains wisdom from a dweller of a chthonic paradise. To the Athenian hero the Labyrinth is a type of the lower world, just as Carthage is to a Roman; thus both heroes make a bond with a chthonic royal woman (Theseus with Ariadne, Aeneas with Dido), but whereas the Greek compromises himself by carrying off the Cretan maiden then abandoning her for unclear or damn ingly selfish reasons, Aeneas' bond with Dido, begun in a cave, is broken by divine command in fulfillment of destiny; indeed, the whole incident is separated from his catabasis though connected to it by analogy and by the appearance of Dido's shade. Theseus' journey curiously ends in the death of his father the king, whereby he be comes king; the focus of Aeneas' journey is to gain life for himself and his people by consulting with his dead father, whom he thus fulfills rather than supplants. For the ambiguous character of Theseus, see McCarty 1986/7.285-9.</page><page sequence="17">The Shape of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 177 has anything to do with the structure of the catoptric metaphor itself, as is true of entrapment. Let me begin an answer by distinguishing what I will call "sexual" from "erotic" metaphors. For my purposes sexual meta phors are those that express the biological polarity of male and female as it is traditionally discovered in the natural world — or, in modern terms, projected onto it. This polarity, Mircea Eliade remarks, is "a qualitative 'morphological' classification" attested throughout the history of religions; "it is the idea of life which, projected on to the cosmos, sexualizes it" (1978b.34; cf. Bachelard 1964). The sexu alized world is a cultural inheritance, part of what Northrop Frye calls the "mythological framework" within which human artifacts are made, and so in an individual work may or may not play an ex plicit role. In contrast, erotic metaphors depend on this sexualized framework but reapply it to human activity and so are normally ex plicit. In the fourth Aeneid, for example, the torrential storm and the sheltering cave are implicitly sexual, according to the mythological fatherhood of the sky and motherhood of the earth characteristic of Greco-Roman culture. They become erotic figures, however, in their correspondence to events in the human world, namely the passionate union of Aeneas and Dido, who are in a sense human analogues of those uranian and chthonic forces, respectively. Now let us return to the question of catoptric sexuality. Since mirroring presupposes a relationship of correspondence and oppo sition, we might suspect that it would induce what I have called a "sexual" relationship between the beholder and the catoptric medium. Two forms of this relationship are roughly distinguishable. In the Thesmophoriazusae, for example, Aristophanes expresses an un natural mixture of male and female attributes by the juxtaposition of a sword and a mirror (140; cf. Anthol. Gr. 5.238), implying more than mere social habit, I think. Rather, the symbolic maleness of the sword37 alerts us in this context to the corresponding femaleness of the mirror, which was popularly regarded in antiquity as receiving and retaining 37 We must remember that Freud had a good classical education. Adams 1982.19-22 provides examples of the fact that "the sexual symbolism of weapons was instantly recognisable in ancient society"; cf. Burkert 1983.59. More generally, the maleness of weaponry is essential to the large number of metaphors that identify or contrast love with hunting and warfare; see Kenney 1970.381-3, 386-8; Parry 1964.270ff.; Segal 1969.44f., 50f.</page><page sequence="18">178 Willard McCarty images within itself, as we have seen.38 This catoptric receptiveness implies that the beholder is correspondingly male, that he or she is thought of as looking into the mirror or is otherwise active or domi nant.39 On the other hand, when the mirror is the source and the be holder the receiver of a vision, the sexual polarity is reversed. This is consistently true with the mirrors of instruction or metamorphosis, when the mirror is not the receptive medium of an active vision but often the vision itself, to which the beholder makes himself conform able.40 Sometimes the sex of the metaphorical mirror may be unclear or ambiguous, or it may alternate, e.g., when the mirror is used inter actively as a cosmetic device, so that (we may speculate) its role would now be passive, now active. Furthermore, containment itself can be 11 ο IKr /&gt;rttv»r*lav aonaoinllir nnfU avatvmlnnr m 1 rr/Afi »λ rt Τ I)Vii1 in other religious literature of the time, the exemplary man is a kind of mirror; thus Joseph sets before his fellow prisoners in Egypt his own life, like a skilled portrait, in which they see their misbehaviour and are ashamed.41 They are in a sense contained in him, yet he is with out doubt symbolically male, they correspondingly female. Before him, as Clement says about the Christian Saviour, each prisoner adorns and regulates his soul "as before a mirror" and arranges it "in every detail after his likeness" (πρός εκείνον ώσπερ κάτοπτρον κοσμοϋντα The femaleness of the mirror is implied by its connection with the menses, as we have seen, but also by the attribution of catoptric qualities to the moon itself, which is consistently a goddess (variously, Artemis, Athena, Kore-Persephone, Trivia) and, like the mirror, often a place of souls. See e.g., Plut., De fac. 3.920f-921b, 24.937f, 938b, 25.938f, 27.942ef, 28.943bd, 29.944ac, and his remark that the moon is called κόρη (daughter, maiden) because that is the name of that part of the eye in which the beholder is reflected, just as the light of the sun is reflected in the moon (27.942d). For the moon as mirror elsewhere, see Aet. 2.25; Apul., De deo Soc. 1.118; Met. 11.3; Αγ., Nub. 752; Lucian, Icar. 20; Macrob., Comm. 1.19.12f.; Vitr., De arch. 9.2.3. Active vision suggests the Platonic "efflux theory," for which see Donaldson-Evans 1980.9-26; it is found, for example, in Pl., Ti. 45bff. (cf. 67cff.); Macrob., Sat. 7.14.13 17; Philo, De Abr. 150; Plut., Quaest. conv. 5.7.680C-683B; De cur. 521c. For the sexual passivity of mirrors, see Plut. Con. praecept. 14.139f-140a. See Schefold 1940.17-19ff.; Grabes 1982.131, 139. Demosthenes, for example, practiced in front of a mirror, so as to judge the effect of his delivery by putting him self in the place of the receiving audience (Plut., Vit. Dem. 11.850e; Quint., Inst. 11. 3.68). De Jos. 16.54.87; cf. Plut., De lib. educ. 20.14a; Quomodo quis suos in virtute sentiat prof. 15.85b.</page><page sequence="19">The Shape of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 179 καί ρυθμίζοντα την ψυχήν καί πάντα δια πάντων ομοίως διατιθέντα, div. salv. 21). In most of the examples I have discussed so far, the mirror has been known as an objective fact. If, however, it is not, then the re flected self-image will, like the Doppelgdnger, appear as another who is enigmatically also the same.42 Many variations of this situation are possible, from the reflected image that Narcissus believes at first to be another youth like himself, to the more general circumstance in which the protagonist is unwittingly within a catoptric world popu lated by aspects of himself. This is precisely what we find in Ovid's Metamorphoses, where the implicitly catoptric revelation, often in the form of a god or goddess, will constitute a "forbidden vision" of the protagonist's intolerable secret self, which is catastrophic to en counter. The sexual polarity of mirroring suggests that the catoptric hypostasis will appear as the opposite sex, as, for example, in the stories of Actaeon and Hermaphroditus. Less often it appears as some one of the same sex but in the context of a relationship in which one member is "male" and the other "female," e.g., in the stories of Ganymede and Narcissus. 5.3 Catoptro-Erotic Entrapment. Let us now draw back from the complex details of sexual sym bolism in order to see how in general it informs the threat that con sistently lurks about mirroring. The present section is concerned with the female eros of the entrapping mirror, the following with the male eros of the assaulting or confrontational mirror. Abundant evidence exists in ancient folk traditions for the simple entrapment that imperils the reflected man's soul43 or for catroptric love-magic,44 but little of this survives as such in classical See Plaut., Amph. 442 (saepe in speculum inspexi — nimis similest mei); Men. 1062ff. (Quid vides? Speculum luom. Quid negoti est? Tuast imago, tarn consimilest quam potest). See, for example, Frazer 1898.5.159; 1911.92-6; Cancik 1967.42f.; Eitrem 1935. 1727-9; Roheim 1919; Marmorstein 1932.40. See Roheim 1919, chap. 4; Marmorstein 1932.37-40; and the circumstances of Apu leius' defense. The decorative elements on Greek and Etruscan mirrors may imply some form of magic; see Karouzou 1951.582-4 on the catoptric images of Helen; the comment by Delivorrias 1984.17 that the ruling view about caryatid figures "iibersieht die religios-magische Bedeutung des Spiegels . . . hinsichtlich der mit</page><page sequence="20">180 Willard McCarty literature. There entrapment and love-magic are assimilated to a kind of erotic or homoerotic epiphany. Let us look at the forms this epiph any takes. Unease with mirroring is hinted in the nervous contempt with which it is regularly dismissed from the male world and associated, as I have noted, with fops and degenerates. The real sense of peril, how ever, goes far beyond ordinary sexual anxiety to a complex fear of erotic fascination, of which the principal goddess is Aphrodite. Bulloch, commenting on Callimachus' contrast of Athena with Aph rodite, notes, for example, that "Aphrodite's coquettishness and mirror were an early feature" of the Judgment of Paris (1985.130), in which her victory is commonly attributed to sexual fascination.45 The catastrophic consequences of Paris' choice point clearly to a negative, death-dealing eros, as Homer notes (II. 24.28-30). Euripides, seemingly working in this tradition, first has Electra condemn Clytem nestra for "sleeking at the mirror your bright hair" just after Aga memnon's departure for the war (ξανθόν κατόπτρω πλόκαμον έξήσκεις κόμης, El. 1071; later pictures the Trojan women on the eve ot the tall, "looking into the tatnomiess orignt aeptns 01 goiaen mirrors" (χρυσέων ένόπτρων / λεύσσουσ' ατέρμονος είς αύγάς, Hec. 925f.; Collinge 1954; Hadley 1894); and finally compares their slavery with Helen's delight in her golden mirrors (Tro. 1108f.). As we would expect, the endless fascination of catoptric ex perience in such contexts implies not the extending of vision but its constriction to a concentrated and powerful focus; the beholder is entrapped, as it were, within the mirror itself or the experience it de fines. In Claudian, for example, Venus' palace is literally a house of A[phrodite] verbundenen und von Afphrodite] abhàngigen weiblichen Schônheit." As Karouzou 1951.582 points out, in a funerary context (in which mirrors are abun dantly attested) catoptric eros probably expresses the desire for resurrection — if not its magical means. Cf. Thomson de Grummond 1982e.183-6; 1982b.27-9; von Vacano 1960.9. 45 See II. 24.28-30; the Homeric Cypria, p. 490 (Loeb); Eur., Andr. 289ff.; H el. 27-30; IA 1300-10; Tro. 919ff.; Lucian, Dial. Mort. 27; Dial. Mar. 7; Colluthus 155ff.; Ον., Ars Am. 1.247f.; Her. 16.65ff.; 20.49f.; Rem. Am. 711 f.; Prop. 2.3.37ff.; cf. Ον., Rem. Am. 65; Prop. 2.15.13f.; 3.8.29f. In the Paneg. Hel., Isocrates displays his rhetorical powers by praising this most shameless and reviled of beautiful women, claiming that Alexander chose Aphrodite not because he thought of his own pleasures but because he wanted to become a son of Zeus by marriage (43). We may take this as the opposite of popular opinion.</page><page sequence="21">The Shape of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 181 mirrors, so that the love-goddess is self-charmed wherever she looks, rapitur quocumque videt (nupt. Hon. 108); in context this is hardly sinister, but it suggests the fundamental catoptricity of eros. In his life of Horace, Suetonius reports that the poet, known to be "immod erately lustful," had just such a mirror-lined bedroom stocked with harlots, "so that whichever way he might look an imago coitus was reflected back to him" (ad res Venerias intemperantior traditur; nam speculato cubiculo scorta dicitur habuisse disposita, ut quocumque respexisset ibi ei imago coitus referretur). Thus eros reduces all views essentially to one view. A corollary to this constricting of vision is the paradox that erotic domination leads to weakness and paralysis, in men more spe cifically to effeminacy or emasculation. This is an old story, and mir rors are sometimes involved. As Collinge argues, "a set of gold mirrors is the stock representation" for the proverbial debilitating luxury of the Trojans (1954.36), who in Euripides, for example, are scorn fully called "chiefs of mirrors and odours" (ένόπτρων και μύρων έπιστάτας, Or. 1112). Paris, whose choice of eros typifies this tendency, fVll 1 C OrtmrantlAnollir η Λ/ΛΛ»· 0/\1/4iar· Τ·-» fAtn/l'n «-*·(* OnomnnUon .M ^ I M WA · 111 V* Τ «Λ 1) UIU1 J VI * AVI lllU^/111 V ditus, catoptric vision leads directly and explicitly to emasculation. There, the mirroring water of the pool {Met. 4.312) and Salmacis' mirror-like eyes (348f.) anticipate the paralysis of sexual self-absorp tion for which the nymph-enwrapped youth is a perfect metaphor (36Iff.). Even the greatest of undomesticated heroes, Hercules, suffers loss of manhood through sexual domination, which Ovid shows us, as it were, in a lady's mirror: Deianira, his wife, complains that Iole "has with her hand taken up the club that conquered wild beasts, and in the mirror gazed upon the armour of my husband!" (instruxitque manum clava domitrice ferarum, / vidit et in speculo coniugis arma meil Her. 9.117f.; cf. Juv. 2.99-103.). Decorations on standing or hand-held mirrors, which were usually supported by a female figure, often include Sirens in addition to Erotes; the Siren is "a natural addition to such a boudoir object be cause of her demonstrated ability to charm and seduce."46 Her presence was no doubt taken by many in this limited sense, but the mythical 46 Thomson de Grummond and Hoff 1982.34. Vermeule 1979.202 comments that the Sirens usually occur in pairs, and when not luring men to their death "may be pictured as plump and self-delighting . . . sometimes introvert, trying on a necklace or looking in a mirror."</page><page sequence="22">1 R9 Μ7ι//ην// λι·/ιι resonances should not be overlooked. In Homer, for example, the Sirens' charm is explicitly fatal; Odysseus survives only with the coun teracting help of Circe, another powerful seductress {Od. 12.39-46). Vermeule points out that the Sirens' temptation is "to know your ulti mate reputation before you are dead," (see Od. 12.189-91); thus they conjure up "the quality of Odysseus' performance at Troy as an eidolon, an image of himself to please his greedy soul, and in this sense the Sirens too are necromancers" (1979.203). Again, the mirror leads the beholder into a spirit-world, here a sinister one. 5.4 Amuletic Repulsion. Let us return once again to the fundamental polarity of mir roring, correspondence and opposition. In the previous section, I dis cussed the symbolically female pole, correspondence, in which the beholder is metaphorically drawn into the catoptric medium and kept there. Opposition, in contrast, is symbolically male: in the negative mode the beholder is not drawn into a trap but met by an equal or superior force, repelled or otherwise defeated (cf. Siebers 1983). Plutarch, for example, attributes the bewitching power of mirroring to a kind of evil influence reflected back upon its source (Quaest. conv. 5.7.682), and Palladius reports how mirrors can be used to avert bad weather from endangered crops {De agr. 1.35.14f.). In both cases the effect is apotropaic, and thus the ancient medical formula and key to amuletic logic, similia similibus curantur ("like is cured by like"), is most perfectly realized by the mirror, which redirects whatever comes to it back upon itself. Thus instead of the catoptric labyrinth we have the catoptric amulet,47 instead of eros (love), the fatal weakness of homo amans, we have something we might call thanatosis (mortification), the effect of imago necans. There is not very much direct evidence for catoptric thanatosis in classical literature, but some interesting speculation is possible based on circumstantial references. If catoptric thanatosis has a central myth, it has to be Perseus' killing of Medusa, where the mirror appears as a weapon that in some way counteracts the weapon of her fatal visage (Apollod. 2.4.2-3; 47 I am using the idea of the amulet in a restricted sense to mean specifically something that works literally as an apotropaic device, thus turning aside evil rather than cap turing it.</page><page sequence="23">The Shape of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 183 Ον., Met. 4.765-803; Siebers 1983.1-4). In the usual account, the hero's mirroring shield, in which he views Medusa and thereby escapes death, cannot have paralyzed her with her own glance, since she is explicitly said to be asleep: dumque gravis somnus colubrasque ipsamque tenebat, / eripuisse caput collo, as Ovid remarks {Met. 4.784f.). Other explana tions are possible: anthropological lore might suggest that the un specified magic of the mirror nullifies the magic of her visage; philo sophical theory that the reflected image is ontologically deficient and therefore harmless (Grabes 1982.109); but a literary observation seems the simplest. Indeed, the imagery itself supplies an answer in the fact that it is Perseus' reflective shield that deflects the petrifying blow of Medusa's visage — clipei . . . aere repercusso, in Ovid's version {Met. 4.782f.) — as it would an enemy's sword-stroke. The comple mentary thanatoptic act occurs when Perseus cuts off the monster's head with his sword. Here, in contrast to Aristophanes' sense of im propriety, we get a fitting juxtaposition of sword and mirror — because the thanatoptic mirror is a symbolically male device. It is used in the story by a male against a female (if Freud is to be followed, the primal vision of womanhood), with the aggressive force of weaponry (1950). Complications loom, however. Medusa is in my sense bisexual, that is, in different contexts she alternates her symbolic sex: to all before Perseus and to all after, in the form of her severed head (the Gorgoneion), aggressively death-dealing, weapon-like, hence male; but to the hero, passive, vulnerable, hence female. Other versions of her history repeat this curious duality (Roscher 1884-1937.1.2.1695 1727). In Ovid she begins a beautiful maiden, who having been raped by Neptune in Minerva's temple, is punished by metamorphosis into her militant ugliness (Met. 4.793-803); in art her visage traces the opposite path, from extreme ugliness in archaic representations to serene or mournful beauty in later examples. It is tempting indeed to think that this paradoxical nature reflects that of the mirror, that she is essentially a catoptric figure: on the one hand, alluring beauty; but especially, on the other, the forbidden, indeed gorgonian vision which so often lurks at the heart of catoptric experience. In the psychological sense, the peril of mirroring is, one can suppose, partly the analogous threat from an objectified self, whom Aristotle calls the beholder's "second Heracles," though in the con text of intimate friendship (Mag. Mor. 2.15.6.1213A). In other cases the appearance of a catoptric Doppelgànger clearly threatens self</page><page sequence="24">184 Willard McCarty identity, as when bosia in Blautus Amphitryon meets Mercury, in appearance his double, and with reference to his mirror-image ex claims, "where did I lose myself? where was I transformed? where did I drop my shape?" (ubi ego perii? ubi immutatus sum? ubi ego formam perdidi? 456; cf. Men. 1062ff.). Then, too, the unwelcome self-image, by shattering an inner fiction, may likewise induce a crisis of identity. The legendary beauty Lais, for example, gave up her mirror, with all that that implies, when faced with evidence of her beauty's decay (Anthol. Gr. 6.1, 18; cf. 11.54, 266), just as in Seneca's view the true ugliness of the soul, had we a mirror in which to see it, would repulse us. By forcing the ugly, angry, or otherwise deformed man to confront his own image, the teacher could be said to use his mirror almost apo tropaically, as a weapon against the deformity of his student (Diog. Laert. 7.19; 2.33; Schefold 1940.17f.). As I suggested earlier, self-development or "individuation" normally follows from such a challenge in moral or exemplary mir roring, but in the negative context it leads to a question for which the ignoti have no answer: "Who am I?" (cf. Cancik 1967.43-5). The fiction r*f tin* f&gt;crr\ Qccumoç q cimnliçtir Hiviçinr» Hpfween sp.lf* anH not self, is exposed by the catoptric image because that image compromises, without obliterating, the distinction between perceiving subject and observed object. It is both self and not-self, and neither self nor not self. The ego is not ego if it is not unique, so evidence to that effect can be presumed fatal. Catoptric thanatosis may thus bring another interpretation to the legends about loss of soul, metamorphosis, or death attendant on seeing one's own reflection.48 In legend and literature the dead do not see themselves — indeed, as Eisler points out, in some con texts disappearance of the mirror-image signifies death (1966.371 n. 2). Ο. conclusion. As I noted at the beginning, mirroring is a difficult metaphor because the catoptric vision is not a cleanly objective phenomenon; its fascination tends to lure the scholar, like that chorus of Trojan 48 See Artem., On. 2.7; Eitrem 1935.1728; Eur., Med. 1162; Marmorstein 1932.40; Frazer 1911.92ff. Note Fry's remark that, "The fear that a mirror will grab off one's soul can only be a product of one's initial shock of self-recognition when confronted with the 'out-there' reflection of one's Self" (1980.55).</page><page sequence="25">The Shape of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 185 women, into endless, untidy speculations. With persistence its various occurrences will, however, yield a taxonomy. The question I wish to raise in conclusion is how generally applicable this taxonomy might be to situations in which the image of mirroring is not literally present. I will offer two approaches to this question: one by considering the kinds of imagery with which mirroring is likely to be associated, and the other by looking briefly at two stories in which the catoptric metaphor is implicit. First let me summarize. The model presented here makes a fundamental distinction between what could be called the dismissive and the significatory uses of mirroring, i.e., those in which the catoptric image is chiefly a representation of a distinct reality knowable without it; and those in which catoptric vision is unavoidable or is itself the reality. (Since in the former kind the catoptric image is of no intrinsic interest, I ignore them.) In the latter, the beholder tends to relate to the catoptric vision in one of two ways, each with its positive and negative aspects. In one, beholder and image are joined by correspon dence or identity, which tends positively towards union with the emulated ideal or negatively towards some kind of entrapment. In the other they are opposed, with the corresponding tendencies to in dividuation or to what I called thanatosis. Catoptric correspondence, I argued, is female and opposition male (whatever the biological mode of the beholder), since in one case the beholder is metaohoricallv drawn into an enclosing medium, and in the other hit by a stronger antagonist. From this inherent sexual polarity, I argue, the erotic component of mirroring is derivable. The negative aspects of mirroring, both female and male, are in a sense equally apotropaic; that is, they "turn aside," either by ensnaring the invader or by repulsing him. Such action, we saw, points to the intimate relationship of mirroring with labyrinthine and amuletic imagery, respectively. In contrast, the positive aspects of mirroring have what we might call an initiatory function, the female drawing the beholder into union with the mirrored aspect of himself; the male facing him with the self-knowledge necessary to individuation. The -f i:l! j· . uiwunι \ji ujmuiai iittuvjui, uiiiiuicu in an external vision oi enaiessiy delightful wandering, shows us the positive form of the labyrinth, just as the positive form of the amulet, the exemplary or sacred icon, may present the beholder with the catoptric image of himself as he should or might be. I have deliberately not paid much attention to these positive forms, though I will return to them shortly, but my point is</page><page sequence="26">186 Willard McCarîv that whether positive or negative, mirroring has affinities with the imagery common to both. Thus, more generally, as an apotropaic device a mirror is by definition concerned with conditional entry; hence mirroring is likely in liminal situations and is potentially as sociated with boundaries, protected spaces, and rites of passage. Mirroring may, then, easily imply a trial, a psychomachia or agon, in which some hidden selfhood is realized, either to the detriment or im provement of the initiand. This is indeed the case in the examples I will give. In narratives of a more complex type, positive and negative mirroring may occur simultaneously. When they do, the imagery of separation or purification becomes relevant; this potentially includes a very large body of metaphor, which I will discuss in the second story. My first story, however, is of the simpler type in that its mir roring is entirely negative. This is the myth of Actaeon as Ovid tells it in the Metamorphoses. Actaeon and Narcissus are closely related in many ways, so a discussion of the former will indicate much about tVio loti or Cor nrocant mimAOAC Τ nrpfpr to ολ/λιΗ Μα tYMCCllC Kppqiicp I wish to address the question of implicit or conceptual mirroring. In Actaeon's story reflection literally occurs but, I will argue, only in order to suggest its covert presence elsewhere in the myth. The covert mirroring we find there is of a particularly important kind for Ovid and for classical culture generally. First some preliminaries. As scholars have noted in recent years, the Ovidian world is comparable to a minefield: innocent, even delightful in appearance, but concealing just beneath the surface a terrible fury all out of pro portion to the individual guilt of its hapless victims (Parry 1964; Segal 1969). It is a world of seeming accident or chance, reminiscent of the society Ovid himself knew. So he says of Actaeon's fate that II you seen, wen, you win nnu in il r-uiiunc » mine, nui ins vneivtu ness" (at bene si quaeras, Fortunae crimen in illo, / non scelus invenies, Met. 3.141 f.)49 — yet we wonder. The gods who inflict such punish ment are elemental in a sophisticated Roman sense, not Hesiodic monsters but still moved by a varying mixture of the seven deadly and very human sins. As centuries of theological speculation had already Cf. his comment in Actaeon written after his banishment: cur aliquid vidi?... / inscius Actaeon vidit sine veste Dianam: / praeda fuit canibus non minus ille suis. / scilicet in superis etiam fortuna luenda est, / nec veniam laeso numine casus habet (Tr. 2.103-8).</page><page sequence="27">The Shape of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 187 suggested by Ovid's time, divine anthropomorphism clearly points to their origin in the human psyche; in modern terminology, they are projections of psychic phenomena (Dodds 1951), or in my terms, catoptric revelations. Ovid more or less said that it is expedient for the exploration of human passions that poets have such gods to work with.50 How else, for example, would we know Actaeon's mind? Let us consider how we know it. Actaeon is a youthful hunter. Whether or not he is virginal (as others like him obviously are), he is engaged in activity conventionally opposed to love, and Ovid, unlike some of his sources, clearly strove to present him as overtly innocent of lust for the erotically charged goddess of virginity.51 Out walking one day he simply stumbles on her secret grotto by accident, spies her naked in her bath, and is consequently torn apart. The tedious ques tion, "What had he done to deserve such punishment?" leads nowhere by design (he had done nothing), but there are signs of a more inter esting question whose answer we have already anticipated at length: "What is the nature of a world in which such things can happen?" The setting is a literally blood-soaked locus amoenus, "a moun tain polluted by the gore of various beasts," during the heat of midday, traditionally a perilous time of epiphanic encounter, and in Ovid re peatedly a time of lust.52 Actaeon's weapons, like those of his comrades, are literally dripping with blood (3.148). The youth, by accident, chooses to walk in extreme . . . recessu (157), in the innermost recess of the virgin goddess' sacred haunt, and so encounters her nakedness. She punishes him by flinging vengeful waters in his face (ultricibus undis, 190), whereupon he becomes what he had hunted, which he dis covers when he sees his features and horns in a convenient pool (ut vero 1 Expedit esse deos, et, ut expedit, esse putemus; / Dentur in antiquos tura merumque focos; / Nec secura quies illos similisque sopori / Detinet; innocue vivite: numen adest.... (Ars Am. 1.637-40); cf. Varro apud August., De civ. D. 3.4. Note Edelstein's comment that for Lucretius man is no longer oppressed by religion, as were his forebears, but instead by human passions, so that he lives in the sins of his heart ( 1940.89 f.). So Borner 1969.497: "Ovid tut ailes, um auf Actaeon nicht den Schatten einer Schuld fallen zu lassen" (cf. 487f.); cf. Otis 1970.133, 396-400. On the sexual implications in Ovid's account, see Segal 1969.44f. and Parry 1964.272f.; in Callim., a primary source, see Bulloch 1985.197f., 218f., 224. For a history of the story and analysis of this problem, see Schlam 1984. ! Mons erat infectus variorum caedeferarum (Met. 3.143). On the traditions surrounding the heat of the midday sun and the meridianus daemon, see Bulloch 1985.179f., and his sources; Frazer 1929.358 f.</page><page sequence="28">188 Willard McCarîy vultus et cornua vidit in unda, 200) just before he is torn apart by his own dogs. (Here he literally sees himself.) The retributive law of nemesis thus seems manifested in his punishment, since the hunter be comes the hunted, until we notice that the crime was not hunting animals but encountering their Mistress sexually (cf. Parry 1964. 272f.). We are led, then, to consider catoptric possibilities: that his forbidden vision of the virgin Mistress of Beasts in the waters of her bath,53 and his forbidden vision of a bestial self in truthful waters of a convenient pool, linked together by vengeful waters, are metaphor ically the same vision. In short, we are led to conclude that on one level the goddess is a catoptric revelation, Actaeon's alter ego, appro priately opposite in sex though conformable in sexual abstinence and the compensatory practices of the hunt. For my second story I will diverge from classical culture alto gether to consider a small but crucial incident in the Hebrew Bible. Here the catoptric metaphor is literally nowhere to be found, al though the morphology of mirroring is quite clear. As promised, I conclude with this story in order to test the generality of what I have presented here. I have chosen a biblical story in particular to set my taxonomy into the wider cultural context that self-referentiality has occupied since classical paganism was assimilated into Christianity. The bridging analogies did not have to be invented. As I noted at the beginning, one of the most interesting and profound of these is the catoptric nature of life as we know it. St. Paul's enigmatic mirror ot fallen vision is almost the only explicit use of this metaphor in the Christian Scripture, but it is solidly based on the Hebrew vision of the post-edenic world. My story occurs in the book of Numbers, when the wilderness wanderers, recently liberated from Egyptian thralldom, approach their Promised Land for the first time. Since it is already occupied and so must be taken, they send two groups of military scouts to find out what is there. The scouting parties return with two wildly different reports. By this point in the exodus, prior incidents have shown that the wanderers are a "mixed multitude" of godly and godless members, and these theologically opposed elements are neatly represented by 53 I am grateful to Paul Stone, Graduate Department of English, University of Toronto, for pointing out to me that in his gloss on the "groves" of Aen. 7.515 Servius com ments that Nemus locus haud longe ab Aricia, in quo lacus est, qui speculum Dianae dicitur.</page><page sequence="29">The Shape of The Mirror: Metaphorical Catoptrics 189 tne two scouting parties, in a pattern 01 separation repeaieu again and again in the Bible, the godly scouts see beyond themselves to "an exceeding good land . . . which floweth with milk and honey" (14:7f.); the godless, like their Ovidian relations, encounter a catoptric revela tion in the form of a demonic land "that eateth up the inhabitants thereof." The land is populated by giants, "and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers" (13:32f.), that is, miniature monsters of de vouring faced by devouring.54 The godly few are blessed and eventually enter their Land, but the godless are cursed to wander until their car casses litter the wilderness (14:29, 33). This wilderness is very much an unstructured labyrinth, where return to a kind of preformal chaos is inevitable, so that the evil ones are indeed repulsed by one mirror image of themselves, the demonic land, only to be caught in another, which equally well and fatally reflects their confusion of mind. As I suggested earlier, this separation of godless from godly implicitly links the catoptricity of liminal visions in the Bible to the wide range of purificatory imagery, from metallurgy at one end of the chain of being (Ps 66:10; Job 23:10; Isa 13:12) to agriculture and animal husbandry at the other (1 Cor 15:35ff.; Job 21:18; Matt 25:33). In this way biblical culture finds a place for the catoptric metaphor perfectly in keeping with its tenor in the classical world, and in turn the metaphor elaborates what the biblical vision more sparingly points to. If, as Northrop Frye suggests, we live inside a cultural envelope still chiefly determined by the biblical story, then the role of the ca toptric metaphor in that story is what finally we must end with. The incident from Numbers shows us its two recurrently possible forms. It can, like the Ovidian world, reflect back dark and unwelcome secrets. Like the exemplary man it can also, however, be the mirror of exemDlarv nature. Accordine to St. Paul the catontric vision is for fallen man enigmatically also the means to something else not "be yond" it (since he has no access to that) but in it. The eschatological vision "face to face" (πρόσωπον πρός πρόσωπον) seems to imply liberation from the mirror altogether, but if face faces face is Paul not talking about turning from one kind of mirror to another? (cf. 2 Cor 3:18). According to Hastings 1963, s.v., "locust," Heb, hàgâbh (grasshopper), is "possibly a small locust or any locust allowed for food." See Lev 11:22, etc.</page><page sequence="30">190 Willard McCarîy If mirroring is, as many of our sources suggest, an intrinsic property of mind, then it can hardly be surprising that its resonances in literature are impossible to delimit. In authors such as Euripides and Ovid, who were preoccupied with the discovery of inner secrets, the metaphor is especially important, and through Ovid's story of Narcissus it has gained an influential personality and a name. We are so surrounded by mirrors that we take visual mirroring for granted, but the essential place of the catoptric metaphor as much in the biblical framework as in modern psychoanalytic theory reminds us that our sense of identity is incalculably indebted to the fact that we find our selves wherever we look. Like the Roman lady literally or her husband figuratively, we adorn ourselves before the world-mirror, conjure up a personality, and so are in constant danger of discovering who we are. This danger, Actaeon reminds us, is not trivial.
