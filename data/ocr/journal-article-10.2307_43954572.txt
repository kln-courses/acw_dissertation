<plain_text><page sequence="1">The "Twice-told Tales" of Annie Saumont SARA POOLE When in 1959 Fredson Bowers opined that certain American critics believed their raw material- the literary text- was "discovered under cabbage plants," he was expressing an exasperation felt by many in the fields of tex- tual criticism and scholarly editing.1 New Criticism had legitimized explica- tion de texte , but appeared simultaneously to outlaw the exploration of any extra-textual input from the Author whose demise Barthes would anyway report eight years later. A quarter of a century on, Hershel Parker would voice his own frustration at "the persistent tendency to treat any literary text as a verbal icon, a unique, perfect, and essentially authorless entity."2 Meanwhile Louis Hay was asking if "Text" could be said to exist3 and Jean Bellemin-Noël was exploring avant-texte.4 Drafts, notebooks, scribbled addenda- any documentation "bound up in the fabric of the text"5 became the province of various interpretative groupings. Differences in some cases were of degree : Daniel Ferrer and Michael Groden might claim that "a textual critic will tend to see a difference between two states of a work in terms of accuracy and error,"6 but textual analyst David C. Greetham in fact stresses that "Textual scholars study process (the historical stages in the pro- duction, transmission, and reception of texts), not just product "7 And John Bryant would celebrate the "fluidity" of the literary work, noting that once we know a given print-text is a trace of an earlier revision process, we "lean into that print-text more closely with a new set of worries and wonders."8 Each approach shares an interest in the temporality of literary endeavors; in tracking their various incarnations. With regard to draftsy this approach can thus only be applied, as Laurent Jenny, citing De Biasi, has it, to that period during which "manuscripts lose their communicating and distrib- uting functions to become 'the personal trace of an individual creation"-</page><page sequence="2">Il8 FRENCH FORUM FALL 2013 VOL. 38, NO. 3 from the late eighteenth century, then, to the time when "the widespread use of word processors relegated the draft to oblivion."9 But this is to overlook another phenomenon not restricted to the last century- one offering similar opportunities for the investigation of those "personal traces" even to scholars exploring post- 1980s writers for whom cor- rected proofs mean consigning Track Changes to the ether. Such is the post- publication rework : the true après- texte. For where access to drafts is typically thwarted by technological advances, the modifying of a previously published piece of work is statistically more likely the longer a writer lives. Present- ing French genetic criticism, Ferrer and Groden explain that it "attempts to restore a temporal dimension to texts";10 it is also possible to extend this prop- erty, pace Jenny, to exploration of the revisions of published texts.11 Literary revision of previously published texts is not necessarily com- mon but is not new. The "allongeails" with which Montaignes 1588 copy of his Essais is annotated constitute one famous example. George Sands Leila, eponym of her essai poétique , dies peacefully in a convent in the 1839 edition, but six years earlier, was murdered. In 1977 John Fowles modified The Magus (1966)- translated into French by the subject of this essay- effecting "rather more than a stylistic revision."12 Nor is "genre" fiction immune; in 2009 Jeffrey Archer published a modified edition of his Kane and Abel , prompting The Times to canvass five writers on the desirability of such an undertaking. (None was tempted, novelist Kathy Lette remark- ing that it was "taking the idea of recycling a bit far," and concluding "Its a book, not a bottle."13) With regard to short fiction, one might cite Katherine Mansfield, who re-worked for later collections pieces first published in journals. Or Eudora Welty, who emphasized that "when its finally in print, you're delivered- you dont ever have to look at it again" the same year (1972) that a much- expanded version of her 1969 story "The Optimists Daughter" was pub- lished as a novel.14 When an author does choose to emend a previously published piece, the reasons for, and degree of, modifications can vary immensely. A writer dis- satisfied with an initial version is freer to restructure in radical fashion, or to opt for less dramatic modifications and undertake what many writers seem happy to term minor "tinkering."15 Prize-winning French nouvelliste Annie Saumont, whether making "contingent" or major adjustments, would how- ever seem to represent a unique example when it comes to the frequency of the revising to which she submits her earlier works.16 A brief history of her publishing and revision practices is first in order.</page><page sequence="3">Poole: "Twice-told Tales" of Annie Saumont 1 19 Initially able to find a publisher only for novels, Saumont began her writ- ing career placing six with four different houses between 1957 and 1976, simultaneously placing stories in the Nouvelle Revue Française and Cahiers des Saisons. In 1969 Mercure de France, who had brought out her fifth novel, incorporated some of those stories in her first collection of nouvelles.17 In 1977 she moved to Gallimard for Enseigne pour une école de monstres , its cover significantly omitting the qualifier traditionally indicating genre, pre- senting the book as developed in twelve "séquences," and noting that there were, "greffées sur ce thème central, douze 'histoires.'" In fact, the work reads as twelve short stories linked by a contrived narrative device, and on the two subsequent Gallimard collections, is indeed referred to as a "recueil de nou- velles," although evidently begrudgingly. Nouvellistey apparently, was still a term to be avoided, the genre seen as lacking a defined readership and hence as not commercially viable. This was an ironic decision, given that for the Gallimard collection Quelquefois dans les cérémonies Saumont received the 1981 Bourse Gon- court de la Nouvelle. The writer who had always insisted she was no novelist was still under pressure: "À chaque fois mes éditeurs disaient 'Maintenant on veut un roman,"' she recalled in a 2002 interview, adding: "Chez Galli- mard, ce fut au bout de trois recueils. Je les ai quittés."18 She went first to the now-defunct Luneau-Ascot, bringing out two collections in 1984 and 1985, before meeting publisher Paul Fournel, whom she followed from Ramsay (one prize-winning collection, 1987) to Seghers (two further prize-winners, 1989, 1990-1).19 In 1990 a collection appeared with Syros-Alternatives, as did a slender two-story publication with A-M Métailié; Saumont then made her final move, to Julliard, who published her eleventh,20 and subsequently the next ten, collections produced to date, also negotiating the reissuing of her fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth. Her twenty-first appeared in 2012. This publishing history, which saw her work "pass through" eight differ- ent publishing houses, several of which would be acquired by larger concerns or closed, is one factor likely to have influenced her regular recuperation- and subsequent revising- of stories that have already been "made public" but became unavailable. Saumont, who has now been writing for publica- tion for fifty-five years, is also regularly invited to select pieces to reissue in slim collections of one to three stories (six such to date); she recovers the rights, and modifies the text, the desire to improve fueling what has become, if not addiction, at least ingrained habit. When she left Gallimard, for exam- ple, Saumont had published four collections: forty stories in all. Only nine of these have not to date been reworked. Hemingway talked of his strug-</page><page sequence="4">120 FRENCH FORUM FALL 2013 VOL. 38, NO. 3 gles with "getting the words right";21 Saumont couches her quasi -systematic revising of previously published work in similar terms: "mes redites sont seulement le besoin de 'faire mieux.'"22 Currently a maximum of forty years separates two variants- "La fille," from the first collection La vie à l'endroit (1969), was reworked as Autrefois le mois dernier for a stand-alone edition in 2009- but a time-lapse of twenty to thirty years is not uncommon. In addi- tion, since Julliard signed her, most Saumont collections have been reissued in a second and on occasion third edition, for each one of which she revisits her work: "je le reprends, je change des choses imperceptibles, je recorrige parfois du déjà corrigé."23 This, taken with the fact that Flammarion has pro- duced two annotated selections of Saumont stories, and that Joëlle Losfeld has published twelve "mini-collections," means that some stories are "thrice- told," and on occasion, appear in four versions. To explore such re- workings is to watch unfold the creativity of an author bringing to bear on early work over half a centurys honed skills. Writing in 2007, Almuth Grésillon observes that "le rapport entre génétique et stylis- tique est encore largement inexploré," a puzzling lacuna. She evokes the pos- sibility of "une nouvelle stylistique qui étudierait la naissance des traits per- tinents du style dun auteur à travers l'histoire de ses manuscrits," exploring such questions as "Comment une écriture évolue-t-elle au fil du temps?"24 The rest of this essay explores three examples of (published) revised stories, aiming to identify patterns in them and establish what we learn, from the choices Saumont makes, about her lexical preferences, concerns related to voice and register, the delineation of character, her compulsion to compress or reduce (no u allongeait here); in short, about the crafting of that hall- mark concision. Some of Saumonts stylistic preoccupations, which naturally influence any rewriting undertaken, have helpfully been pointed up by the writer her- self in rare interviews; thus, observing that "le Nouveau Roman m'a trans- formée [. . .] a transformé ma façon de penser, d'écrire," she explains that one effect of this has been that she concentrates on actions: "Je raconte ce que font les personnages, pas ce qu'ils pensent" ("les," and not "mes," we note).25 What Saumonts characters say, or the way they narrate "their" story, is con- veyed using a vocabulary, a style, that is essentially oral, and which thus contrasts with the progressively rarer passages of extradiegetic description. Fellow-writer Jean-Noël Blanc, used as sounding-board, has established his own partial list of Saumonts concerns, evoking for example her rejection of the preterit as being "trop daté surtout: elle a beaucoup appris et retenu des critiques de nouveau roman contre le romanesque simpliste"; her need</page><page sequence="5">Poole: "Twice-told Tales" of Annie Saumont 121 to track down "les mots précieux, exotiques, maniérés"; her determination to "chasser les redondances," lexical but also phonetic: "trouver quand' et qu'en dans le même paragraphe la désole."26 Those critics, librarians and actors who have commented on her work, almost exclusively positively, in the French daily press and specialist short-story journals such as Breves or Nuits Blanches , all stress the pared-down style, its "dépouillement" as well as its "rigueur." Novelist and short-story writer Marie Le Drian recalls her first encounter with Saumonts minimalist punctuation- "Stupéfaction pour moi. Le mot nest pas trop fort"- and what she retained: "J ai beaucoup appris au sujet du mot juste. Pourquoi utiliser "faire" ou "savoir" lorsqu'il existe des verbes plus précis?"27 Other considerations are also systemati- cally taken into account, as an investigation of the following three examples hopes to establish. "59 Roubaix" (Roubaix is the administrative center of département 59) has experienced four separate publications to date. It first appeared in the Nouvelle Revue Française (1984); was included in Saumonts sixth collection Il ny a pas de musique des sphères (1985); was modified for Embrassons-nous (her fourteenth; 1998); and was selected for Aldo , mon ami et autres nou- velles (an annotated collection destined for school study; 2002). 28 The story consists of an unevenly distributed dialogue between two temporary foster- parents, during which the reader learns why the boy they are caring for is in care (his mother, unbeknown to him, has shot dead his violent father), and about the foster-fathers own father (executed by firing-squad during the French Indochina War for refusing to destroy a redoubt full of civilians). As it opens, the anonymous foster-father (typically, no character is named) is recounting how, in response to the boys enquiry about the word "red- oute," he explained the word and furthermore created a dramatic scenario wherein such a stronghold might exist, for example, near the Belgian bor- der, the boy featuring as brave young soldier participating in "l'enlèvement de la redoute." The foster-mother gently reproaches him throughout with various faux-pas: these include references to firearms, to fathers in general, to redoubts and to Roubaix (he has forgotten that the child comes from the town, with a father employed by the mail-order company La Redoute). "59 Roubaix" is a seven- to ten-page text, revisited for each publication, but within whose trajectory the majority of changes correspond to the lon- gest time lapse- the thirteen years separating its second (1985) and third (1998) appearances. As is usually the case, revision for Saumont is, primar- ily, synonym of reduction. Here a strike-through indicates deletion:29</page><page sequence="6">122 FRENCH FORUM FALL 2013 VOL. 38, NO. 3 Et voilà, tas fait la gaffe. Ça ría pas manqué j'imagine quii te dise "Roubaix cest là que j'habitais." Et puis aussi que son père - Mais cest parti malgré moi. T as pourtant vu son acte de naissance né le huit cinq soixante dix-sept, trois rue de Mouvaux à Roubaix. Roubaix eest- pas mal, rappelle-toi on y a passé la journée quand on est allés au mariage du cousin. (77, reduced to 70, words) In the modified version, bold indicates an addition: Et voilà. Tu as gaffé. Ça ría pas manqué j'imagine qu'il te dise Roubaix c'est là que j'habitais. T'as pourtant vu son acte de naissance né le huit cinq quatre-vingt-sept, trois rue de Mouvaux à Roubaix. Souviens- toi, Roubaix on y a passé la journée quand on est allés au mariage du cousin. (150; 52 words) This second version is over 25% shorter. Excised is the foster-mothers impression of Roubaix, not germane to the narration, and also the second hint that all is not well with the boy's father, presumably as this is brought up again twenty lines on. (The child's year of birth is also advanced a decade to reflect the date of the third edition.) Further on, we learn more about the boy's background: Ils habitaient du côté du canal, vraiment un quartier pas terrible. Déjà le Nord je trouve ça plutôt triste, mais aux Services Sociaux ils disent qu'elle soignait bien son marmot, qu'il a jamais manqué de rien. (78; 36 words) ' La mère tenait la maison dans un quartier pas terrible. Mais le rap- port du tribunal confirme qu'elle avait grand soin du marmot, qu'il a jamais manqué de rien. (151; 28 words) Here again the revised version is almost a quarter shorter (22%). The wom- an's opinion of the area, something of a non sequitur, is omitted, and the reference to the social services is replaced by the mention of the (family proceedings) court findings, evidence of Saumont's emphasis on precision, as examined below. A further characteristic of Saumont's modifications is a modernizing of vocabulary within the familiar register she most frequently uses. Thus the "colonel superdécoré" of versions one and two is thenceforth "multi - décoré" in deference to changing fashions in prefixes; an army general, ini- tially "ultra- superdécoré," is subsequently "couvert de médailles"; a "coup de fanfare" qualified as "vrai" becomes "méga." The man initially counters</page><page sequence="7">Poole: "Twice-told Tales" of Annie Saumont 123 his wife's reservations (as to the appropriateness of his stories about armed conflict) with an "il adore ça," which is replaced by "il se régale," not pre- cisely a more familiar term, but one very widely used. The boy is deaf in one ear as a result of a blow from his father, initially rendered as the neu- tral "coup" but then transformed into the more familiar "baffe." His mother kills his father with his own "revolver" which becomes a "pétard"; one good thing about todays world, opines the foster-mother, is that women "se lais- sent plus assommer"- the verb is then replaced by the once more in vogue "rosser"- by their menfolk. Authenticity of voice is punctiliously verified. Nor is the paralinguistic neglected: when the foster-father, developing his explanation of the function of a redoubt, describes an officer writing home to his mother, he notes the boys reaction: "Le gosse il m'a dit, à sa mère, ah, et à son père il écrit pas?" (76). The "ah" here equates to an "I see" or "oh, really?" The revisited version, however- "à sa mère ho, et à son père il écrit pas?" (149)- comprehends, via the "ho," censure of what the child views as unacceptable oversight. A certain amount of what might be termed contextual or "cultural" updating is understandably in evidence. In 1984 the boy s spirit of enquiry is approved by both foster-parents, particularly as "à son âge il y en a tant qui ne pensent qua se curer le nez et à réclamer des glaces à la fraise" (75). By 1998 the complaint is rather that the young "ne pensent qua mater les con- neries de la télé" (145). When calming the child after a nightmare the woman originally offers him- "le gaminou"- a cup of "cacao." In the last two ver- sions a major brand-name is used: "du nesquik" is proffered to "le minot," the latter term possibly replacing the original because linked to the Mar- seille area and thus a reminder that Roubaix is distant. But there is also evinced in the revisions of this story that quest for extreme precision and what one might term a sharpening of focus that have come to characterize Saumonts writing. To take the latter point first: in 1984-5, enquiring as to how her husband found himself embroiled in tales about redoubts, the foster-mother comments: "Oui mais moi je me demande pourquoi tu es allé lui parler dune redoute dans cette région" (76).30 Her husband explains how his father "a seulement pas voulu massacrer tous ces Tonkinois" (80), and then wonders "ça lui avait servi à quoi de sapitoyer sur le sort des innocents" (81). In the later versions the vagueness of these ver- bal constructions is rejected for the balder "Je ne comprends pas pourquoi" (148); "refusé de massacrer" (154); "il a dû regretter d'avoir eu pitié" (155).31 And in a rare example of adding material, Saumont replaces the brief refer- ence to the Indochina execution - originally evoked with a brief "On lui a</page><page sequence="8">124 FRENCH FORUM FALL 2013 VOL. 38, NO. 3 bandé les yeux" (81) - adding direct speech to push the point home: "Lui sur le terrain d exécution et les copains qui s alignent. En joue. Feu" (155). The aim of achieving optimum lexical precision- the mot juste evoked by Le Drian, above- is evidenced by the replacing of the vague "employé" by "gardien" in reference to the boys fathers job; the use of "attaquer" for "prendre" in respect of the redoubt; the abandoning of the generic "goûter" for the easily visualised "tartines"; the substituting for "là où ils gardent les stocks" of "là où sont entassés les stocks" in the description of the ware- house where the dying father bled profusely over piles of garments. And it could be argued that the same motivation fuels the double modification of a line towards the end of the story, when the sobering perspective of the childs inevitable return to his mother is evoked. Thus the initial "On sera bien obligés de le laisser aller. Se forcer à pas oublier. Être raisonnable" (201) is revised to read "On sera bien obligés de le laisser aller. Forcément. Y penser. Être raisonnable" (81) but becomes in the third (and fourth) the more intense, harsher "Faut pas rêver pas déconner" (155). As this last example indicates, while many revisions principally reflect the thirteen-year gap, this is not always the case. Thus the foster-mothers initial observation concerning the practicality of the credit-card- "Le monde moderne faut quand même reconnaître quii a quelques petits avan- tages" (202; 12 words)- becomes in the second version "Le monde moderne, il a quand même quelques petits avantages" (82; 10 words), but is shortened yet again in version three (and four) to become "Le monde moderne a des avantages" (156; 6 words). And it is only in the final (2002) version that the expression "faire des prix," in reference to La Redoutes capacity to propose special offers despite losing soiled stock in the shooting, is replaced by the more precise "baisser les prix." A final significant reworking concerns presentation. Long paragraphs, unfinished sentences, others begun in media res , minimalist punctuation "juste donnée pour nous aider à suivre. Sans négociation"32 - these are char- acteristic of Saumonts prose. Revisions of earlier stories do however tend to return to the typographical question of the appearance of the text on the page, and this is one such. The first two versions, of seven and eight pages respectively, contain in total three paragraph breaks, only two of which reflect a change of speaker. In the following two, however, paragraphing cor- responds to the couples exchanges, and there are forty-one indentations. Easier to read, this format helps avoid confusion on the part of the reader, now more confident in the attribution of lines of dialogue. The various incarnations of "59 Roubaix" thus offer examples of several</page><page sequence="9">Poole: "Twice-told Tales" of Annie Saumont 125 matters its author was concerned to address, represent many of her preoc- cupations, and highlight her aim to cut away perceived slack and tighten up on accuracy of expression. Other concerns can be identified in "Un coup manqué," a longer story to date modified once only. One of the eight com- prising Saumonts first collection La vie à lendroit (1969), it was re-worked for Après y her thirteenth; twenty- seven years separate the variants. A lengthier piece by some two-thirds than "59 Roubaix," "Un coup man- qué" is recounted by an anonymous first-person narrator, currently held in a cell, but whose thoughts swoop dizzyingly from present to near and more distant past. Brief cameos sketch the straitened circumstances of the young mans family: mother preparing food, cleaning, reproaching, and father, a wood-turner unemployed since severing a tendon chopping wood for the stove his wife has insisted on for their frail son. The protagonists existence revolves around this muted family life and the nearby forest until he takes seasonal work grape-harvesting and meets Anne, with whom he subse- quently exchanges letters. Locally, he discovers that a poorly-off worker has built a hut in the forest, and often on his walks meets the wife play- ing with her baby, evidently contented to be living close to nature ("Elle ne dit pas que les enfants salissent tout et font du bruit. Elle ne prépare pas pendant des heures longuement des plats nourrissants et économiques" [180; 110] ).33 But as his horizons seem to be expanding, he is expelled from school for a minor incident in which his involvement is not clear, and meets Berthier, of whom his mother disapproves. This misogynistic bully boasts of his sexual conquests, makes his pregnant girlfriend drop from trees in the forest to abort and plans the burglary that goes wrong and results in the current incarceration. Meanwhile fire destroys the cabin and the pro- tagonist believes the woman and baby are killed ("Lavocat me dit d'oublier la forêt, l'incendie de la forêt, personne ne maccuse" [205; 124]). In prison, the hand of the over-attentive warden blurs into the crippled hand of the youths father; placed on his shoulder, it segues into that of Berthier clap- ping him on the back; extended, it is a piece of meat recalling the cuts the butcher gave him when he had painted the shop-front. We understand that the protagonist, picked up by the police hurling bank notes into the river, has joined Berthier in a robbery, obeying his injunction ("Cogne") when a torch is shone on them; on his arrival home, in a flashback scene that forms the chute , his jubilant mother announces that his father has found work as a factory night-watchman- and he realizes precisely whom he has attacked. "Un coup manqué," much more heavily re- worked, offers several exam- ples of preoccupations absent from the revisiting of "59 Roubaix." The</page><page sequence="10">126 FRENCH FORUM FALL 2013 VOL. 38, NO. 3 removal of the extraneous is still a priority: "Je tire sur le crochet pour ouvrir la fenêtre et je regarde la mousse qui fait sur le mur une tache verte" becoming simply "Par la fenêtre je vois la mousse sur le mur une tache verte" (178; 110), together with a mise à jour of the lexicon- "donner une claque" (189) becomes "flanquer une baffe" (115), "blue-jeans" drop the "blue" etc. But characterization is also affected in this story. As he and Berthier walk in the forest, for example, the protagonist initially notes that "Je la connais bien" (170) but this is revised to the more proprietorial "Cest mon domaine" (105). He observes that trees are often cut down: "pourtant je la reconnais, je peux marcher pendant des heures et dire: ici il y avait un mélèze de trente ans" (171), he explains, but twenty-seven years on the phrases are short and sharp, the emphasis on drama rather than history, the imperfect replaced by the present perfect: "je sais, jbbserve je vérifie, le hêtre a disparu, ils ont même arraché la souche" (105). The violent Berthier, who pursues Josette, impregnates her, and then forces her to try to abort, becomes more so because the language used to portray him is cruder. We first hear of Josette as the little blond whom he "voudrait bien soffrir" (172)- in the second version "Berthier voudrait la sauter" (105)- and when she becomes pregnant, she is initially "une vraie noix" (189), but the latter variant uses more aggressive terms- "Putain, elle est débile" (115)- and points up his distaste: "Je lai aimée baisée dans la forêt. Elle est toute molle, une limace" (194; 118). Were we in any doubt as to the more threatening depiction, we note that in 1996 his jacket pocket is no longer home to his lunch: "Il a enfoncé un sandwich couteau suisse dans la poche de son blouson" (173; 106). While this darker tale is structured around repeated metaphoric refer- ences to peeling or stripping away, which is what the mother does to vari- ous vegetables, the son to wood, bark, or layers of old paint, and also what the reader must do to reconstitute the protagonists story, repetition of other elements is sought out and excised. Thus "Il me montre la rue, la place. La maison. Brincart et Feugères. Import-export. Au coin de la place Saint- Eustache" (198; 19 words) becomes "Il dit Brincart et Feugères. Import- export. À Saint-Eustache, au coin de la place" (120; 13 words), a saving of almost one third which erases the second "place." And the rewritten "J ai enfoncé mes doigts creusé dans le savon et après j ai sucé mes doigts" (179; 110) both avoids repetition of "doigts" and reinforces the other expressions pertaining to scratching away at a surface threaded through the piece. Cer- tain other modifications eliminate the recurrence of sounds highlighted by Jean-Noël Blanc (in a muted version of Flauberts gueuloir, Saumont records</page><page sequence="11">Poole: "Twice-told Tales" of Annie Saumont 1 27 herself reading aloud for precisely this reason): "une touffe de mousse" (171) is thus recast as "un lichen minuscule" (105), avoiding the double [u], "la boue rouge" (176) as "la vase du fossé" (108) with the same result, and "la soupe brune fume" (182) ([y] [y]) of the earlier version is simply omitted. Revision also ensures that the original image of the protagonist throwing stolen bank notes off a bridge into a river- "je jetais les billets dans la rivière par-dessus le parapet du pont" (181-2)- loses the inappropriate tongue- twisting. It becomes "je lançais du haut du pont les billets dans la rivière" (ni), which may sacrifice a certain elegance with regard to word-order, but avoids the inappropriate alliteration. There is also discernible what can be termed an intensification of emotive vocabulary. The protagonists evocation of the slow-drip unhappiness reign- ing at home offers regular glimpses of his maimed father trying to adapt to his injury, and his harassed mother preparing progressively more frugal meals. When her son is one of those expelled when obscenities are drawn on the class register, she is distraught- "Elle pleure courbée vers la table" (192) - but the verbs are stronger in the 1996 version: "Elle geint ployée vers la table" (117), "geindre" more desperate than "pleurer," "ployer" introduc- ing the notion of sagging, buckling. Further on, "Maman soupire" (196) becomes "Maman gémit" (118), and towards the end of the piece "une soupe au pain" (202), all she has the wherewithal to make, becomes "de la soupe au chagrin" (122), a concoction, and a term, presumably inspired by "la soupe à la grimace," but less nourishing. It is finally unlikely that the transformation of the description of swirling bank notes- "le vent les faisait tourner empor- tait comme des feuilles mortes"- is anything other than intertextual wink in the direction of the 1945-6 Prévert/Kosma composition in which, it will be recalled of the dead leaves, "le vent du nord les emporte."34 A final example incorporating a reconceptualization not represented in the two stories discussed above is illustrated by "La retraitée." The story recounts the last day of a retiring school-teacher, who receives her long- service award in a brief ceremony and on the way home pauses at a café. Joined at her table, apparently deliberately, by a silent, sad-eyed man whose gaze arouses in her feelings she finds disturbing, she is concerned by her emotional state and, excusing her brusque departure, exits precipitously. The reader then learns that the man is blind and the waiter a romantic, an opportunist, or simply a liar: asked by his customer to describe the woman with the attractive voice, he replies that she was "Jeune et jolie." Originally published in 1962 in Cahiers des Saisons ,35 the story reappeared seven years later in Saumonts first collection. This second version is frac-</page><page sequence="12">128 FRENCH FORUM FALL 2013 VOL. 38, NO. 3 tionally shorter and less traditionally punctuated. An evolution in the teach- ing day means that the "huit heures de classe quotidiennes" (75) that she is shedding become seven; correction of repetition is evidenced when a fourth reference to the large "glace" covering the café wall becomes a "miroir"; the qualifiers describing pupils and colleagues become a little harsher, with "récalcitrantes" becoming "insoumises" and "des pimbêches" further casti- gated as "poseuses." And expunged is one expression- an image- that may conceivably have been seen as constituting one of the "mannered" words which Blanc claims Saumont hunts down: in the original "les gros livres de cours, sur sa table de travail, étalaient leur reproche" (76), but any hint of anthropomorphism is eradicated in the second wherein "étalaient leur" is replaced by the prosaic "étaient un" (137). 36 However the most dramatic alterations are made in the third (1996) vari- ant, retitled "Encore un café sil vous plaît," wherein the third-person nar- ration is abandoned.37 The protagonist, but also colleagues, pupils, the cus- tomer, and the waiter are all represented in the first-person. Thus rather than observations to the effect that "Eliane Garbin pouvait bien désormais pouffer de rire au milieu dun exercice de sténo" (136), we are shown the retir- ees weariness at forty years spent with "ces ados insupportables" (80) who refused to submit homework and greeted her rebukes with "des remarques grossières dans le style oh là là quelle tare, mal lunée aujourd'hui" and "à mi-voix des menaces que je prétendais ne pas entendre" (80). But plurivoc- ity also enables us to see the reactions of different pupils, from the realistic "Pourrait débarquer à sa place un mec vachement tare ou une nana encore plus nulle" (76) to the pensive "j aurais voulu lui parler. Des choses de la vie. J ai pas osé" (78) to the pragmatic "Qu'est-ce que tu paries quelle senrôle au Soutien Scolaire ou dans un commando contre 1TVG?" (81). The rhythm and the breadth of the piece are thus entirely transformed, and it reads as a drama, reminding us that several Saumont stories have been adapted for theatre and one made into a court-métrage .38 This brief exploration of the fortunes of a selection of stories seeks to spotlight a variety of recastings and examine them within the context of Saumonts linguistic and literary agenda. Repeatedly the drive to trim, to refine, is evidenced; there is no "slack" in these intense cameos of modern life. Saumont s often damaged characters are progressively shorn of descrip- tion, their utterances increasingly bereft of dialogue-introducers or adverbs; in the last example cited, for example, additional voices are introduced essentially to point up the solitude of the original single narrator. Distilled to the most precise and concentrated form, each story constitutes a scaffold</page><page sequence="13">Poole: "Twice-told Tales" of Annie Saumont 129 on which we are to graft our own imaginative edifice- the demands made on the Saumont reader to build upon her work, to reconstitute fragmented narratives, increase as her word-counts drop . . . Unlike drafts, previously published variants of reworked pieces do not offer the enticements of ambiguous addenda or penciled doodles. But they undoubtedly allow us to track some of the changing aims and priorities of the creative writer: to see, too, that literary clay is not necessarily set hard just because it has already been submitted to the public gaze. Saumont can thus be seen putting into practice in her prose those principles she estab- lished long ago with regard to the short story: "Tout au plus doit-on don- ner des repères. Cest au lecteur de remplir les blancs," she explained in 1994.39 "Le nouvelliste doit retirer un maximum d'éléments de l'histoire qu'il raconte et cest au lecteur ensuite de boucher les trous," she maintained in 2012, confirming also "Je refuse d'écrire quelque chose comme: 'il pensai40 Thus she pares down, eliminating everything deemed extraneous, each reworked story a slimline, more focused version of its original (her record must be the scalpelling out of a nine-page short story from her sixth and last novel, itself 141 pages long).41 While not unmindful of Hershel Parker s observation that, when earlier edited manuscripts were made available to them, critics tended systemati- cally to endorse "the unspoken maxim, 'To Revise Is To Improve,5 "42 this brief exploration of three Saumont stories tends to be persuaded by the majority of the revisions- confident that they provide visible "evidence" of her adherence to the aesthetic principles she (when cornered) propounds, and offer proof of the interest inherent in the examination of the revision of pre-published work. But it also aims to provide enough examples for readers to want to make up their own minds. University of Reading (UK) Notes 1.
