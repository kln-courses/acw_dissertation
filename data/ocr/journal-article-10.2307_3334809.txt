<plain_text><page sequence="1">HIDDEN TREASURES FROM CENTRAL AFRICA Art Gallery of York University January 10-31, 1973 It is difficult, if not impossible, to review one's own show. On the other hand, it seems to me that it is usually the person who wrote a book or selected an exhibition who, when the book is out or the exhibit is opened, is then the most critical and de- sires the most changes or modifications in the work accomplished. In any case, the following paragraphs are not to be under- stood as a review but rather as information on the exhibition "Hidden Treasures from Central Africa." The idea to organize it was shared with Michael Greenwood, Curator of the Gallery, who also found the title for the show. With his cooperation, the layout was done. The Faculty of Fine Arts of York University reinforced the tight budget of the campus Gallery by awarding a grant which enabled printing of the cata- logue. The exhibition displayed 72 pieces from several central African areas, selected from the collection of the Royal Ontario Mu- seum (R.O.M.). As I stated in the in- troduction to the catalogue, "The R.O.M. African collection is doubtless one of the most distinguished in North America. Al- though it comprises works of art and other objects from Africa it also has an intimate relation to Ontario. The overwhelming ma- jority of the material was collected by On- tario people in the period ranging from 1875 to the 1920s." The collection began its growth at the turn of this century at the Normal School and several Church Col- leges in Toronto. It was then brought to- gether by Dr. C. T. Curelly, first director of the R.O.M., and increased mainly in the ... 9L-: ': ANTHROPOMORPHIC POT. MANVU (?), ZAIRE. FIRED CLAY, 9'/4" HIGH (DETAIL) CARVED AXE HANDLE.

The first pieces were collected not later than the 1870s and 1880s, yet the col- lection, containing pieces remarkable his- torically as well as aesthetically, remained unknown to the public mainly due to the permanent lack of space in the Museum. The scholarly community, however, was aware of some important pieces in the col- lection, and at the exhibition of "Masks" (1959, A. D. Tushingham) and of "Forgot- ten Peoples" (1969, E. S. Rogers) the R.O.M. curators displayed several objects. A few pieces were shown on other occa- sions. The exhibition at the York campus pre- sented a selection from one of two histori- cally important parts of the R.O.M. collec- tion. It included the material from modern Gabon, Congo, Cabinda, Zaire, Angola and Zambia. The nucleus of it was collected in the first two decades of this century by Ca- nadian missionaries. The study of old news- paper notes, bills, letters and other material in family and R.O.M. archives made it possible to provide most of the dis- played objects with data about their prov- enance and periods when they were collected. Thus, not only were the objects brought to light but also the first results of a long-term historical research project could be shown. The first significant corpus of the objects was brought from central Africa by Rev. Walter T. Currie and his wife. In his head- quarters in Chisamba (Bihe, Angola) where he established (1875-1900, 1914) an In- stitute for Training of Teachers and Preachers, he brought together a remark- able collection of Ovimbundu objects which are of artistic, historical or eth- nographical interest. Three of them (two female figures and a staff) were chosen for the show mainly because they differ sub- stantially in their structural qualities from what is as yet known about Ovimbundu sculpture. Rev. Currie probably reached the Chokwe and Lwena (Lovale) areas so that the objects collected there also prob- a i: a: :':. :1* :1-:: .r: :p 9. SITTING FEMALE FIGURE. WESTERN KONGO, ZAIRE.

Of special interest are the ensemble of the Lwena (Lovale) stools with rich anthropomorphic and zoomorphic motifs, some large Lovale drums with ornaments of great simplicity and restraint, and numerous decorated Lwena (Lovale) Sansas. Four of these were incorporated into the show, contributing to the little knowledge we have of these former refugees from Lunda, who gradu- ally scattered to eastern Angola and north- western Zambia. Some of the Lovale (Lwena) objects might have been collected by Rev. Currie in or after 1903. By that date, he had left Bihe with his expedition to go across Central Africa and follow the traces of Livingstone. He returned from this trip with a considerable number of ob- jects of all kinds. Approaching Lake Mueru from Katauga, he collected Luba, Lunda and Luba-Hemba artifacts. He then crossed the Luapula, stopping at Kazembe, and stayed with the Bemba, and then vis- ited the Ngoni, Lala, Swaka and Lamba at Lake Benguelu, and later arrived at the Balovale and Barotse areas. The collected material made the reconstruction of his trip possible, and also represents the major part of some 600 items of Rev. Currie's col- lection in the R.O.M. Although many of the objects may interest an ethnographer or anthropologist rather than an art histo- rian, this portion of the collection also in- cludes pieces which significantly enrich the slowly emerging picture of the art of northeastern and southwestern Zambia (such as the Kazembe objects, Luchazi carvings, or the singular figure used by the Bemba and probably made by the Lunda). Another large complex of material in the exhibition was brought together by Rev. T. 80</page><page sequence="2">Hope Morgan who passed through the lower Zaire region and then stayed at the mission in Kasai from 1890 to 1912. Twenty-four of the pieces displayed, most of considerable aesthetic quality, came from his collection. Those from the west- ern Kongo are small in size but rare in oc- currence. Particularly noteworthy are the Solongo or Yumbe chiefs cap with leop- ard's claws and teeth, and the richly orna- mented khobe-the box with magic ingredients used by the Khimba society as a marriage fetish. Rev. Morgan's Kasai collection is also most important historically, since direct contacts with the white man in the Kasai only began in 1883, and the first mission there dates back to 1890. The collector's careful notes reveal that he had not yet used the name which is now applied to a group of people living at Lulua River (Bena Lulua), although he was in contact with their objects. His notes, in conjunction with the objects, bring attention to several historical problems which need to be fur- ther researched. One concerns the Songye group of Zappo-Zap (Nsapo) to whom Rev. Morgan attributed several objects which are usually considered to be Kuba by stu- dents of African art. A similar art historical problem is posed by the pottery collected by Rev. J. Bla- keney from the basin of the Uelle River in the first quarter of this century. Anthropo- morphic pots, attributed by modern schol- ars to the Mangbetu, appear in the old R.O.M. inventory under two headings: that of the Mangbetu and that of the Manvu. Since the two groups of pots differ in shape, process, and decoration, it seems possible to credit the Manvu for some anthropo- morphic ceramics, although both past and contemporary writers (J. Czekanowski in 1909, H. Van Geluwe in 1967) speak rather convincingly about the poverty of their pottery. Thus the intention of both the exhibition and its catalogue was not only to display in- teresting art objects, but also to pose ques- tions for further research and to provoke the collegial response. Let me warmly thank those who, since the catalogue was published, brought to my attention infor- mation which is very useful for further work. The show was part of a long-term project which aims, on the one hand, to do the critical catalogue raisonn6 of the entire R.O.M. African collection to which I was invited in 1971 by the Museum Director and which is being processed with the en- couragement and understanding of Dr. E.S. Rogers, Curator of the Department of Ethnology, and his assistant, Mrs. K. Wood. On the other hand, the project has a goal to pursue the study of documents from public and family archives as far as these pertain to the objects, and thus contribute to the research of Canadian Africana. The show was not limited to sculpture but also included embroideries and exam- ples from other fields of art. The out- standing ensemble of central African smith work owned by the R.O.M. was repre- sented by an inkula, a Kuba ceremonial knife with lead and brass inlays; a large in- cised Lalunga knife; a Luba (Lunda?) dag- ger with the paraphernalia in leather and skin, and an ingeniously shaped Zande throwing knife. Also shown was a tubigo, a knitted mask costume of a guardian of the Pende mukanda (initiation camp). Its five parts were displayed as hangings. There are some pieces in the show which are not accompanied by complete data about the collector, provenance, and dat- ing, but which are important due to rarity or aesthetic quality. For example, two fig- ures in wood, unique in structure and close in morphology to those found by D. Biebuyck in the 1950s in the Basikasingo villages, are undoubtedly also interesting from a historical viewpoint. Their datum ante quem is 1914, when the R.O.M. pur- chased them from a London dealer. A Tsogo figure used in the Bwiti cult, pur- chased in the 1950s, is remarkable in qual- ity and affinity to the piece from the Paul Tishman collection (R. Sieber's and A. Ru- bin's catalogue, # 111). And finally, three Kongo sculptures, two nkisi figures and a tomb piece of a mother with child, are very distinguished representatives of the art of that area. Purchased in 1924, they were collected in Landana, Cabinda. It is awkward for me to say whether or not the exhibition was successful. Mr. M. Greenwood, Curator of the York University Gallery, was pleased with the number of visitors who came to York University to see "Hidden Treasures from Central Africa."
