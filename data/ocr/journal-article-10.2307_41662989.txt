(Courtesy Servicio Aerofotografico Nacional, Peru) MOCHICA MURALS AT PAÑAMARCA By Richard P. Schaedel MOCHICA known, Peru for CULTURE chiefly as long because as HAS its archaeology of BEEN the excellence FAMOUS has been IN of Peru for as long as its archaeology has been known, chiefly because of the excellence of Mochica ceramics. A red and white Mochica portrait- head jar or vase with painted figures (Archaeology 3.95) is generally the most typical item that one may look for in museum collections from Peru. Although the literature on Peruvian prehistory is studded with illustrations and descriptions of Mochica pottery, it is notoriously weak on other aspects of Mochica cul- ture, notably architecture. This is especially surprising in view of the fact that over fifty years ago Max Uhle identified one of the largest mud-brick structures in Peru, known as the Huaca del Sol, near Trujillo, as of Mochica construc- tion. In 1925, after the last big rain on the Peruvian coast, some wall paintings were discovered in an ad- joining ruin, known as the Huaca de la Luna, which Uhle had also identified as Mochica. One of the pur- poses of the study of coastal architecture which the In- stitute of Anthropology of the University of Trujillo carried out last year, with the aid of a grant from the Autumn 1951 145</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 2.

The wall crenelations are a Mochica architectural trait, reserved like the friezes for special buildings. Note the stone foundations of the exterior wall. The wall height averages seven meters. Colt Archaeological Institute of New York, was to locate all other traces of Mochica building activity, both in its presumed home valley of Moche, and to the north and south. In this enterprise we were quite successful, and we can now demonstrate that the Mochicas had erected sizeable pyramids in the four valleys to the north and to the south of the Moche. It was in the southernmost valley, Nepeña, that we made our most felicitous finds, in what seems to have been a secondary center of the Mochicas, Pañamarca. Pañ- amarca, because of the loftiness of its adobe ruins, was known even to the travellers of the nine- teenth century. A description of it was included in George Eph- raim Squier's Peru, published in 1877. In the twentieth century the site received no attention until Bennett, in Archaeology of the North Coast of Peru, published in 1939, described it briefly and referred to remains of badly pre- served wall paintings. Soriano Infante, in an article in the Peruvian Revista del Museo Nacional of 1940, referred to these remains, and to some others which were better preserved, but published no illustrations. When we arrived at Pañamarca in 1950 to make a study of the ruins, it still remained to be de- termined what people or peoples built Pañamarca and what was the extent and significance of the fragmen- tary murals. Our reconnaissance crew consisted of one director- photographer, one student assistant of pure Mochica ancestry, two engineers from the University of Trujillo, and a student aide-de-camp whose chief job was to collect sherds and maintain liaison. We were operat- ing from the Institute jeep out of our base in the nearby port town of Chimbóte. Our schedule called for five days, but after the discovery of the well- preserved murals and a group of burials, we were obliged to remain another two days and to send a rush call to Trujillo for the artist, Sr. Pedro Aza- bache, also of Mochica descent, who made tracings of the paintings and executed reproductions which are exhibited in illustration of this article. The site itself is reared on a rocky outcrop on the lower middle portion of the Nepeña river's north bank. At first glance the ruins resemble a monstrous accumulation of adobe bricks from which certain large walls and a pyramid emerge. Actually it is composed of three principal structures, joined by a series of courtyards to a large plaza. Separated by a thin strip of vegetation from this group is a second outcrop, with a much more irregular surface. At its foot are remains of yet another large adobe structure and behind this building is the large cemetery used by the builders of the ruin. At various points on the lower periphery of rocky outcrops were circular de- pressions for grinding. On one of the rocks we found petroglyphs and another showed evidence of having been worn smooth by sliding. Slides like these have been found in the highlands and may not necessarily be prehistoric, but their proximity to ruins suggests that they were. On most of the walls lining the courtyards and at various points in the buildings themselves we found 146 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 3. Pañamarca, Peru.

At least five distinct occupations could be distinguished at Paña- marca. The earliest one, to which we should hesitantly as- sign the petroglyphs and perhaps the small building at the foot of the plaza, was appar- ently by the local peo- ple of the valley. The Mochica phase, which was the most grandi- ose and impressive, followed, and we might suggest dates of c. 600-900 A.D. for their arrival. It is un- likely that they occu- pied the site for a very long time. To them we should attribute the three principal structures grouped about the central plaza. They were suc- ceeded in turn by a Ti- ahuanacoid phase (c. 900-1,100 A.D.), dur- ing which time a small stone building was erected and certain al- terations were made in the other structures. After the Tiahuana- coid occupation, the site apparently fell into disuse except for occasional dumping or as a burial place. The Mochica Occupation The three principal structures with their joining courtyards that were originally built and embellished by the Mochicas appear to have had distinct func- tions, but at present we can only hazard a guess as to what those functions may have been. The highest building is the pyram- idal one atop the hill. We could discern little about its original Mochica form except that it was roughly rec- tangular and smaller than the terraced cir- cumstructure which is shown on the plan. The large cut in the center was mostly the work of treasure hunt- ers, although some of the exposed walls were finished and in- dicated that the build- ing was not solid throughout. The pres- ent zigzag ramp, fac- ing northwest, was built at a later period. The original Mochica orientation was prob- ably northeast. The stairway leading to the plaza indicates where the hypothetical Mo- chica ascent to the pyr- amid would have be- gun. Opposite the zig- zag ramp is the corner building, which has suffered even greater depredations than the first. Only the gross form of the terraced circumstructure could be plotted. Numerous cuts which had been 148 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 6. Pañamarca, Peru. The rock with the petroglyphs. The drawings are not in Mochica style and are probably earlier.

Here we found three well preserved panels of mural decoration, one of which is shown on the cover of this issue. We have indicated on the plan the two possible entrances on the northeast and northwest. Both may have been used. To the immediate northeast of this cor- ner building is a rather complicated ante- chamber built on the ascent of the outcrop. At its lower extremity it leads via a door, past a terraced unit, onto the large rectan- gular courtyard which adjoins the south- east platform of the third principal edifice. This building is essentially a graded series of platforms, with a small superstructure near the center. It appears to have been entered from the northeast corner by a long ramp. In con- trast to the main pyramid and the corner build- ing, this edifice has a maximum of open space at the top, and seems to have been a place where people could assemble in numbers. We could not ascertain whether this building had been of original Mochica construction except for its northwest face. It betrayed no later al- terations at any rate. The large central plaza originally had been sunken. On the inner facing of the wall lining the northwest side we discovered the proces- sion of warriors and priests illustrated below. To the west of the first two buildings described, and forming the back of the ruin, are a series of small structures and partitions, which may have served as living quarters, since layers of refuse were found in this zone. The large empty enclosure which bounds the ruin on the northwest may have served as a gather- Autumn 1951 149</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 9. Pañamarca, Peru. A cluster of perforations for grinding, near the northwest corner of the ruin at the base. These holes were found at two other points in the ruin and occur at other sites of Tiahuanacoid occupa- tion on the coast. These may be noted on the ground plan, Fig. 3, as circles at lower and upper left. Fig. 10. A surprise find, a Tiahua- nacoid burial practically on the sur- face, was discovered by the author too lazy to pick up a potsherd. He kicked away half of a polychrome bowl which was lying atop the four shown here. Just below these a group of Mochica burials was found. The "tank" is about fifteen feet away. ing place for soldiers, prisoners, etc. Its exterior walls had been painted in polychrome, which proved that it was a Mochica structure. Òur group at Pañamarca gives a rough idea of what the general plan of the Mochica center was. The three main buildings and large court form the core which was generally oriented up-valley. The other large cen- ter already alluded to is in the Moche valley and con- sists of the Huaca del Sol and the Huaca de la Luna. It is larger and somewhat more spacious in layout but has the same architectural components. The inference is inescapable that these were not mainly dwelling sites. The small amount of dwelling refuse indi- cates that at best only a few priests or persons of importance lived at the center along with their attendants and some artisans. The elaborate embellish- ment of the walls, with symbolic designs and figures in processional attitudes, indicates that the buildings were probably used for re- ligious ceremonies, when the population which could be concen- trated in the plaza area assembled from various parts of the valley. Cer- emonial centers like these contrast strongly with later sites of a truly urban character, where emphasis was placed upon living quarters at the expense of elegant pyramid-temples. The Tiahuanacoid Occupation The people who suc- ceeded the Mochicas, as we have already indicated, were Tiahuanacoids. This term refers to a people of presumed south highland origin (near the southern end of Lake Titicaca) , who either migrated to or conquered the central coast or perhaps did both, and then proceeded to move up the north coast as far as the Jequetepeque valley. Their polychrome textiles and ceramics share much iconographie content with the stone work of Tiahuanaco (Archaeology i .66). Hence the name and the interpretation. They seem to have been responsible for the final shape of the build- ings which we drew. Their modifications of the main building were ob- vious since the later wall facings were covered with ochre paint and easy to follow. They consisted of the steep, zigzag ramp approach on the northwest face and the addition of the step terraces on all sides. The small stone edifice to the southeast was their only original contribution and it is typical of the masonry elsewhere found in association with Tiahuanacoid remains. In the center of this unit we found remains of another Mochica wall painting, but so far below the floor that only excavation will re- veal its relationship to the sub- structure of which it is presum- ably part. The Tiahuanacoids must have been responsible for some of the partitioning between the main and corner buildings, but we 150 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 11.

This panel was left un- touched by the Institute except for some clearing away at the base. Fig. 12. A second panel in the corner room, showing an anthropomorphic bird figure holding a conch shell. could not determine how much. The corner building it- self appears to have been filled in and covered up externally by the Tiahuanacoids, as we could determine by the courses of adobe covering the paintings. They appar- ently followed a similar pro- cedure with the sunken plaza. In the area where we cleared away the material immedi- ately in front of the friezes, we found that the friezes themselves had been covered up by two courses of adobes and that further toward the center the plaza seemed to be filled with miscellaneous ref- use. This suggests that the Tiahuanacoids utilized the sunken plaza as a dumping ground. Although it is not clear as to their reasons, it would appear that they levelled the top of the wall lin- ing the plaza so that the heads of all of the figures were destroyed. While it is conceivable that the Mochicas themselves may have placed the adobe covering against the friezes, it is difficult to explain away the architectural decapita- tion. In the pilfered refuse of the dumping ground we found, sig- nificantly enough, not a single Mochica potsherd; so that it is fairly clear that they did not use this zone for refuse. Like the Mochicas the Tiahuanacoids used the area on the ad- jacent outcrop for burials although both groups also buried their dead outside the walls of the main ruin. We discovered this quite by accident while searching for potsherds. One of the large sherds which I carelessly kicked turned out to be half of a bowl, which together with three others formed the grave accompaniment of a Tiahuanacoid. Some twenty-five centimeters below him we found several Mochica burials. The perforations in the rocks which occurred in clusters at various points in the ruin we have called grinding holes, since they show rotary ab- rasions. Similar holes have been found in other sites with T iahua- nacoid remains, so that they probably were made by the Tia- huanacoids although we do not know what substance was ground in them. On the basis of a few days' reconnais- sance we are obviously not in a position to in- terpret the significance of the Tiahuanacoid occupation of this im- portant Mochica cen- ter, but the cumulative evidence that we did uncover tends to indi- cate that the north- ward moving Tia- huanacoids met the southward expanding Mochicas at Paña- marca, and it is not improbable that a de- cisive struggle took place here which may have ac- counted for the abrupt disappearance of Mochica cul- ture on the north coast. The rather significant altera- tions in the buildings at Pañamarca indicate that the Tiahuanacoids thought highly enough of the site to use it for their own purposes. When they in turn were Autumn 1931 151</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 13.

This reprodu by the artist Sr. Pedro Azabache, of Moche, a few day eventually displaced, declined, or what you will, the site fell into disuse, except for an occasional group of people who used its sacrosanct precincts for a cemetery, or its strategic heights as a watch tower. Evidence for the post-Tiahuanacoid occupation was found in some burial remains in the plaza-dump area, indicating that its third and final function was that of Fig. 14.

A more specifically post-Tiahuanacoid cemetery was on the northwestern fringe of the ruin where the modern thicket fence describes a rough, in- complete oval. Here ceramics of the Chimu and Inca periods had been dug up by the local huaqueros and were purchased for the museum of the University of Trujillo. The Polychrome Friezes The friezes are best treated as two units: the panels in the corner room, and the procession of warriors and priests found in the interior of the wall lining the sunken plaza. The first group consists of three large 152 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 16 (above). The priest to the left of the head priest.

It measures 1.70 meters in height and 1.60 meters in width. The figures are approximately 1.40 meters high and 40 cen- timeters wide or life size. A clay coating was applied to the adobe walls as a primer. Upon this the outline of the design was incised and the colors were painted in. The scene obviously represents two individuals fight- ing, pulling each other's hair out by the roots. Al- though Mochica ceramics show motives similar to this, it is the first time it has been shown on a wall painting. The other two panels, which are approximately the same size, portray a cat-demon with a conch shell on its back and an anthropomorphic bird figure (Figure 12), possibly a priest masked as a bird of prey. These two panels were found at right angles to one another, about twenty-five feet from the first. The second unit consists of eight life-size figures (from the neck down), extending a total length of thirty feet. The maximum height of the figures is 1.50 meters. The full palette was employed on this frieze and consisted of white, the base color, red, yellow, brown, dark blue, black and gray. The composition suggests some sort of procession or ceremony centered about a central figure. Our conjec- Autumn 1951 153</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 18.

THE COVER: Two important Mochicas pulling each other's hair out by the roots, one of the polychrome panels of mural decoration found in 1950 at Pañamarca, Peru, by the Institute of Anthropology of the University of Trujillo. The reproduction is from the life-size copy made by the Peruvian artist Sr. Pedro Azabache. turai interpretation is that the three figures on the left and the one at the extreme right are warriors. They are differentiated from the other major figures by what for lack of a better suggestion we call "knee guards" and shirts without tassels. The warriors at the left, to judge by their raised feet and joined hands, seem to be en- gaged in a dance. Three individuals, of a somewhat higher order of importance, may be distinguished to the right and left of the principal figure by the absence of the knee guard and the presence of tassels trailing from their shirts or tunics. We shall refer to them henceforth as "priests" if for no other reason than to avoid calling them "figures." It will be noted that both the priests and warriors have a semi-lunar knife suspended from their belts by two thongs. On the basis of Mochica pottery scenes we can safely say that this knife was used principally for decapitation, and figures prominently in what might be interpreted as scenes of sacrifice. The typical offensive weapon of the Mochicas was the mace, the defensive the shield. The principal figure, whom we are calling henceforth the high priest, is shown in front view and wears a tunic with three serpentiform figures. He is the only man in the group not shown with the knife. A possible interpretation of the otherwise puzzling figure to his left is that it represents an anthropomor- phized knife in its sheath. This anthropomorphization of weapons occurs on the fragments of the only other Mochica frieze, which was discovered at the Huaca de la Luna near Trujillo. (For a discussion and illustra- tion of the only other Mochica friezes so far found see Kroeber's Archaeological Explorations in Peru : the Northern Coast, 1930.) It may of course be consid- ered equally well as the dehumanization of the weapon- bearer. Such an explanation would accord with an- other feature of Mochica art, namely the reduction of minor figures of presumably inferior social status to something like half of their normal dimensions. On the other hand the intention may have been to represent dwarfs, in which case this would be our earliest docu- ment in Peru for the practice reported in Inca times of using hunchbacks, dwarfs, and other deformed people as court attendants. The tiny figure above the "anthropomorphized knife" probably represents part of a background scene which has been destroyed. The purpose of this brief description has been to present this magnificent document of Mochica mural painting in its prehistoric context without comment on its obvious aesthetic qualities. Our hope is that all the friezes so faithfully copied by Señor Pedro Azabache may presently be reproduced in color, so that the full richness and vigor of Mochica art may be appreciated by the art historian. Even more, however, we hope that this description will serve as a timely note and warning to lovers of art and archaeology in Peru and elsewhere that this rich source of vivid mural decoration, which today only awaits the patience of the archaeologist to reveal, may tomorrow be irrevocably destroyed. If these still unrevealed documents of the human spirit are not to be forever lost to us, we must constantly keep in mind two ideals: as archaeologists, to devote our attention first and foremost to the adequate documen- tation of fragile paintings; and to create among the public in general an awareness of their aesthetic as well as their documentary value, so that the present apathy towards their preservation may be replaced by a sense of obligation towards their protection. 154 ARCHAEOLOGY</page></plain_text>
