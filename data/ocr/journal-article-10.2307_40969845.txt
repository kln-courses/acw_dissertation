Neuwied am Rhein: Hermann Luchter- hand Verlag, 1964. 369 pp. Price not indicated. I his edition combines seven treatises which were published in vari- ous journals, American and foreign, within the past four decades. They deal with the religious element in political philosophy, the idea of immortality in the ideology of law, and the ancient classical ideas of justice and law and their ideological function in the interest of authority and power. The focus is Plato's and Aristotle's phi- losophies of natural law, their motivations, assumptions, contradic- tions, and consequences. The issue, however, is not merely natural law and its philosophical and juridical reason and rationale, but rather the very foundation of Western political thought in view of the historical significance of natural law. Kelsen's inquiries, both irreverent of accepted traditional verities and indifferent to the con- sequences of their exposure, are sharp and merciless like an inquisi- tion; and his findings are sufficiently dangerous to be ignored, dis- torted, or irrelevantly protested. The initial treatise, "God and State/' published in 1923, traces the religious origin of man's search for absolutes. Like Freud, Kelsen found the quest psychologically motivated and, like Durkheim, that it was grounded in earliest human times when nature and society, God and Man, and the sacred and secular, were not yet differentiated, and man's vision of the universe was entirely anthropomorphic or sociomorphic. In those archaic times, the father, later figuring as Father, God, or King, was the source of norms, and his authority, like his power, absolute. Numerous philosophies of law and justice throughout the history of ideas not only endeavored to explain but also purported, or happened, to legitimize orders of law and authority, existing or de- sired. Two of these philosophies are treated in this book: Plato's, representative of the metaphysical school of justice, and Aristotle's, referred to as "pseudo-rationalistic." 1 i Cf. "What is Justice?," in Hans Kelsen, What is Justice? Justice, Law, and Politics in the Mirror of Science; Collected Essays (Berkeley: University of Cali- fornia Press, 1957). This essay, a summary of Kelsen's critical arguments against theories of natural law, forms both an introduction to, and conclusion of, his ideological critique.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 487 The dominant idea in Plato's philosophy is Justice. Although Plato states that Justice is a part of the Good he does not specify the substance of Justice. Nor does he specify the contents of the Good. Plato, therefore, could not contend, for example, that Justice means retaliation; for retaliation hinges upon knowledge of the Good. Hav- ing given no answer to the material question of Justice and Good, Plato has recourse to philosophers who, he mystically believes, are graced with an intuitive ability to divine Justice. By virtue of their supreme gift, Plato demands that philosophers should be kings, and the masses, lacking the inspiration of philosophers, should be their obedient subjects. Thus Plato's formal idea of Justice offers a ra- tionale usable to legitimize any authority of any person or persons. Whatever Plato's motivation and intent may have been it is an authoritarian ideology which rationalizes a division of society into two strata, the one stratum composed of the few declared to know Justice and Good and, therefore, qualified to hold power, and the other, hoi polloi, who are the objects of their rule. Plato's motivation in regard to his authoritarian philosophy is treated in "Platonic Love," published originally in Freud's Imago in 1933, and in English in The American Imago (III, 1942), where the author analyzes Plato's social and psychological relations to his mother and father. The emotional source of Plato's authoritarian thinking is found in his homoerotics. "Still more than every other creative work is that of the great men of ethics rooted in their personal life, and all speculation about Good and Evil - and Plato's philosophy is essentially to be understood as just that - rises from the ethical experience commoving the whole personality" (p. 114). In "The Hellenic-Macedonian Politics and the Politics of Aris- totle" the author analyzes Aristotle's moral metaphysics and shows its close parallel to Plato's, however great the differences in other areas of their philosophies are. Like Plato, Aristotle gives no answer to the crucial question about the substance of Justice and Good; and like Plato's ethical postulate for Justice, Aristotle's is shown to be an empty formula which can be filled with any contents wanted. Thus a positive lex can always be rationalized as moral jus. Com- parable to the psychoanalytic explanation of Plato's authoritarian motivation, Kelsen shows how also Aristotle's authoritarian political philosophy converges with his personal political experience, namely, the contemporary power conflict between the Hellenic polis-democ- racy, on the one side, and the Macedonian monarchy, on the other side, to which Aristotle, a Macedonian subject, belonged.</page><page sequence="3">488 SOCIAL RESEARCH Two treatises inquire into "The Idea of Natural Law" and "Plato and the Doctrine of Natural Law." The association between au- thoritarianism and natural law is found to be intimate both theo- retically and historically. Natural law is not only serviceable to ra- tionalize authoritarian systems but, as social and political history amply prove, has also rendered the service, however disparate and opposite the systems were. "One can easily show that it is mainly an attempt to legitimize positive law through natural law, to justify any and every rule of positive law on the basis of the power vested in the norm-giving authority by natural law and thus to secure an autocratic-aristocratic form of state" (pp. 112 ff.). Kelsen's ideological criticism is as relevant now as it was at the time of its first publication. Its outstanding qualities are chiefly three: first, the fundamental significance of the subjects, or rather, subject, since all treatises are merely variations of one and the same theme, to wit, the ideology of authoritarianism; second, the strict objectivity of the analyses in which, regardless of their authority and dominance, hitherto undoubted conceptions of classical philosophy are questioned, probed, and found faulty; and, third, the construc- tive contribution which the author's re-examination of accepted principles can make to a regeneration of philosophy and social and political theory. Kelsen's critique was not successful. The counter- critique was based not on the merits of his findings but on fears of disastrous consequences which these findings would have for the status quo of established regimes, dogma, and tradition. While these fears are only too well justified they do not affect the validity of Kelsen's critique. Hunter College of the City University of New York Philipp Weintraub</page></plain_text>
