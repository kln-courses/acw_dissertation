Excavation uncovered more urban features ofthe Late Roman city (two colonnaded thoroughfares and residential units ofthe fourth to seventh centuries c.e.), more of the Archaic fortifications that protected part ofthe lower city in the sixth century b.c.e. and of a building with several clearly-defined seventh century b.c.e. features. A mistaken notion about the design ofthe Classical or Hellenistic Metroon is corrected. The design and construction of the Pyramid Tomb at Sardis were clarified; and a sixth century b.c.e. date was determined from masonry and ceramic evidence for the tumulus at Bin Tepe that has been called the Tomb of Gyges. INTRODUCTION Sardis, and about a tumulus farther away, at San- ?ah, northeast of Golmarmara. The results of excavation and related archae? ological exploration at Sardis in the field seasons of 1990 and 1991l are the subject of this report; the season's programs also included conservation, graphic recording, study, and site en- hancement projects.2 Information in this report is derived largely from more detailed manuscript re? ports written in the field by expedition staff mem? bers; copies of those reports are filed in the Sardis Expedition Office at Harvard University. Excavation concentrated on two regions of the city site: Sectors MMS, MMS/S, and MMS/N, lo? cated at the foot of the Acropolis (fig. 1, nos. 63- 65) and Sector ByzFort ("Byzantine Fortress"), a flat-topped spur on the north flank of the Acropolis (fig. 1, no. 23). The Pyramid Tomb was reexca- vated (fig. 1, no. 14). Cleaning and study provided new information about the tumulus called Karni- yank Tepe, located at Bin Tepe, 10 km north of SECTORS MMS, MMS/S, MMS/N Sectors are located at the foot of the Acropolis, directly south of the Roman Bath-Gynmasium com? plex; one or more of them has been under excavation each year since 1977 (Greenewalt, Ratte, and Raut? man 1994 and references). The principal features un? covered in all three are Late Roman, i.e., fourth to early seventh centuries c.e., and Archaic, i.e., sev? enth to mid-fifth centuries b.ce. Sectors MMS and MMS/S are marked in the modern landscape by low artificial hills (fig. 2), which are substantially created by the ruins of a huge Archaic building, "Colossal Lydian Structure" (figs. 14, 15). The division be? tween the two hills is probably created by the Late Roman colonnaded street (fig. 3), which cut through the Archaic building. Sector MMS/N is directly north of MMS, across the modern highway. C.H.G.</page><page sequence="5">GREENEWALT, RATTE, AND RAUTMAN AASOR 52 1 SYMNASIUM-BATH mag.

MASTER URBAN PLAN ^3*SS Fig. 1. Sardis, general site plan. Sectors MMS, MMS/S, and MMS/N, Roman Levels Extensive Roman and Late Roman remains lie across the three MMS sectors. Located near the city's large western bath complex, this urban quar- ter included broad streets flanked by colonnaded porticoes, behind which stood small shops, taber- nae, and elegant townhouses in the fourth to sev? enth centuries (fig. 3). Excavation in 1990 and 1991 continued to explore this Late Roman residen? tial neighborhood and document its earlier history.</page><page sequence="6">1994 THE SARDIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1990 AND 1991 :*M&amp;'j&amp;'&lt;^J?m?Bi Fig. 2. Sectors MMS/S, MMS, MMS/N, view looking northeast. The artificial mounds of sectors MMS/S and MMS are in the foreground, on the nearer side of the modern highway. A chain of artificial mounds that extend east from the Roman Bath-Gymnasium complex appears in the middle distance, center and right. The following discussion proceeds from north to south. Sector MMS/N. Lying just north of the present highway, Sector MMS/N stands midway between the large public buildings of the Bath-Gymnasium and Synagogue to the northwest and the residential area of MMS to the south. In Roman times the sec? tor included a marble-paved plaza standing at the east end of the broad Marble Road, with a monu? mental colonnade extending along its south side (see Crawford 1990: 3-5). Previous work iden? tified the major features of this portico, including a row of large columns erected in two sections and two superimposed mosaic floors (Greenewalt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994: 6). After recording and study in 1990 and 1991, parts of these surfaces were lifted in order to explore earlier features of Roman and Archaic date. In its latest, sixth-century c.e. phase, the MMS/N portico comprised two distinct parts unified behind the long primary colonnade (fig. 4). The colon- nade's deep foundations attest its use throughout late antiquity, although variations in the size and interval of surviving bases suggest its piecemeal construction and repair. The colonnade's western part faces a substantial, 8-m-long wall that extends from a broad doorway with threshold east to a large projecting pier. East of the pier is a stylobate on which at least five columns or piers stood on large Ionic bases and one inverted pier-capital. To the south of the second colonnade lies the raised floor of the inner portico, which was covered by a thick layer of fallen brick and tile (Greenewalt et al. 1983: fig. 14). Excavation of this debris ex? posed a small part of the inner portico and traces of its mosaic floor. At least two large mosaic panels occupied the inner por? tico. Behind the first four columnar intervals are small panels with interlocking circles and scales, a border of interlacing cables, and a field of Solomon knots, inter? locking circles, and interlace patterns. Farther east be- gins a second large panel with a three-strand guilloche frame surrounding large roundels filled with interlacing cables and enclosing Solomon knots. The range of motifs corresponds with the previously suggested sixth- century date for the mosaic. Coins and pottery recovered from above its surface date from the sixth and early sev? enth centuries c.e., when the portico's superstructure finally collapsed.3</page><page sequence="7">GREENEWALT, RATTfi, AND RAUTMAN AASOR 52 IZMR-ANKARA HGHWAY MMS/N t.

Sector MMS/N, colonnaded ambulatory, upper mosaic floor, plan. The floor of the main portico was covered with polychrome mosaics at a slightly lower level. Pre? viously exposed parts employ guilloche and inter? lacing cable patterns together with a fragmentary inscription (Greenewalt et al. 1983: 13, fig. 16). Further excavation of this ambulatory yielded little more of the mosaic, which was seriously eroded in antiquity. Coins and pottery from its bedding rein- force a sixth century date for its installation. Excavation below this surface and its packing re? vealed extensive remains of a lower mosaic floor in the main portico (fig. 5). This bichrome mosaic con? sists of two well-preserved panels that meet just north of the back wall's projecting pier. The two panels are closely related in design and share an ivy leaf border on the north side that continues to the main stylobate. The more westerly of the two large panels lies about 1 m in front of the portico's back wall between doorway and pier, separated from the wall by a narrow roughly cobbled surface. The panel consists of a compound guilloche border sur- rounding a field filled with loosely knotted squares enclosing Solomon knots, ivy leaves, and quatre- foils (Greenewalt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994 : 6, fig. 4; a related pattern, used elsewhere at the Marble Road is presented in Crawford 1990: fig. 24). While remaining regular in its details, the mosaic's south and east sides splay out toward the nearby pier.</page><page sequence="9">GREENEWALT, RATTE, AND RAUTMAN AASOR 52 k?JD= ? MMS-N LOWER MOSAIC FEATURES PLAN Fig. 5. Sector MMS/N, colonnaded ambuiatory, lower mosaic floor, plan. The second panel lies between the two colon- nades beyond the wall pier. The outer ivy leaf bor? der stops abruptly along the line of a possible ledge or raised step at its east edge. The main panel consists of a bead-and-reel border surround- ing a field in two parts. To the east is a panel of ca? bles forming interlacing circles. The larger, more westerly field is subdivided by interlacing cable bands into a regular grid of small compartments with diagonal Solomon knots. The northeast corner of this decorative grid is interrupted by a 2.7 x 1.7 m box containing a well-preserved inscription of seven lines (fig. 6). The Greek text records the decoration with mosaics of the embolos during the term of the prefect Flavius Archelaos, who is named as "most illustrious" companion (comes) of the first rank (IN90.21).4 The text reads as follows: *EK?VTt}8r| 6 ivpoXot, KCti ndvxa xbv k6g\xov siXr|(pev 8ii (pXapioi) ApxeMoi), toO XajLi(KpotiiTOD) KOfi(r|Toc;) Ttpckou paOuoi), Sictcov- xoc, xf\v s%ap%ov The colonnaded street was paved with mosaic and received all the decoration when Flavius Archelaos, companion of the first rank of his Serene Highness, held the Offiee of Prefect.</page><page sequence="10">1994 THE SARDIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1990 AND 1991 Fig. 6. Sector MMS/N, colonnaded ambulatory, lower mosaic floor, inscription (IN90.21). Most of this lower mosaic was lifted after record? ing and study. The mortar bedding yielded a num? ber of coins issued in the fourth and the beginning of the fifth centuries c.e. Excavation beneath the main portico's lower mosaics exposed a group of foundations that survived the area's early fifth-century development. In the western portico area several unattributed foundations were built immedi? ately above Archaic levels (below, pp. 13-18). Among the earliest Roman features is a 7-m-long row of closely fitted marble blocks that continues the approximate line of the Marble Road's south colonnade. Lying just south of the later stylobate, this solid foundation abuts a large square pier built of reused Archaic blocks, carefully mortared around a rubble core. A correspondingly deep parallel foundation about 5 m south may have supported the back wall of an earlier portico. A deep mortared drain and three large terracotta pipes ran from west to east between the foundations. Isolated patches of mortar bedding suggest an opus sectile floor may have paved this area. At a later date this area was turned to other less pub? lic purposes. Four new foundations enclosed a 5 x 6 m trapezoidal space that may have served a shop or tab- erna. To the west a small (1.2 x 0.4 m) latrine was added to the adjacent space, facing away from the street and emptying into the earlier drain. Similar foundations found east of the square mortared pier suggest the steady encroachment onto this public space by domestic or in? dustrial structures. Despite the lack of intact floors, lay? ers of packed fill suggest a fourth-century date for these features. The latrine deposit included Roman pottery and coins dating to the late fourth century c.e. All of these structures were removed and paved over during the new colonnade's construction shortly after 400 c.e. Sector MMS. The central MMS area lies across the present highway immediately south of Sector MMS/N. Roman features belong to an irregularly- shaped residential block that extended south of the plaza at MMS/N and was bounded to west and south by broad, colonnaded streets (fig. 7). Excavation in 1990 and 1991 revealed several new rooms of this residential quarter and selectively explored their underlying features. Room IV is a narrow, irregularly shaped space near the highway that offered an opportunity both to explore earlier phases of the Late Roman complex</page><page sequence="11">GREENEWALT, RATTE, AND RAUTMAN AASOR 52 + + + + Fig. 7. Sector MMS, Late Roman residential units, plan. and to ascertain the condition of Archaic levels east of Colossal Lydian Structure. In its original form Room IV comprised a long corridor leading south from a presumed entrance near MMS/N to meet the perpendicular Room V (Greenewalt 1990: 3-6). A broad, unroofed alcove lay along its east side, while to the west multiple doorways opened onto the adja? cent Rooms III and VI. In the latest occupied state, a flight of four steps with a landing rose 0.65 m at the room's south end. Excavation beneath the final floors of Room IV clearly documented the intensity of local activities from the sixth century c.e. down to Hellenistic times, and pointed to deeper un- explored Archaic strata. Gently sloping layers of mudbrick debris from Colos? sal Lydian Structure underlie several isolated founda? tions of possible Hellenistic date. By the third or early fourth century c.e. a deep foundation stood along the west side of this space, underlying Room IV's west wall, and was perhaps accompanied by a shallow portico with piers facing east. A deep covered drain ran in front of both wall and piers from south to northeast. Also to an early phase belongs a small ironworking hearth in front of the piers; standing nearby was an amphora base filled</page><page sequence="12">1994 THE SARDIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1990 AND 1991 rr/v^ Fig. 8. Sector MMS, north wall of Late Roman street and adjacent resi? dential spaces, looking northeast. with lime, which may have been used in the smelting process. Around the early fifth century c.e., this open area was absorbed by the quarter's residential development. The rebuilt west wall continued to organize the area, with new walls shaping spaces to either side: small rectilinear rooms stood to the west, while along its east face stretched Room IV, already acting as a kind of corridor. During that phase a narrow vestibule with a water fea? ture stood at the room's north end, while along the east side opened a slightly less spacious alcove with a door? way to the east. Room IV retained this basic shape throughout the fifth and early sixth centuries c.e., when a network of pipes and drains served the domestic needs of successive generations. As noted elsewhere in the sec? tor, each campaign of renovation took its toll on earlier features, which were often isolated by construction pits and foundation trenches. Room IV's floor level did not rise appreciably before its final phase of occupation in the sixth century. Excavation in the south part of the MMS sector exposed several additional rooms of the residential complex and identified its southern boundary (fig. 8). The thick north wall of the MMS street cuts diagonally through the area along the approxi- mate line of a long-used village track. Of the sec? tion exposed in 1991, the western part of the wall cuts through Colossal Lydian Structure and retains collapsed mudbrick debris to the north. An arched opening announces the east face of the Archaic wall, similar to the opening along its west face (Greenewalt, Cahill, and Rautman 1987: 17, fig. 4; below, p. 18). Built of mortared rubble with brick bands and pierced by occasional doorways, the street wall continues along its northeasterly course to define the quarter's southern edge. Rooms XXVI-XVII and Space XXVIII lie be? tween the large domestic spaces of the more south- erly residential unit and the nearby street wall. Piers and partitions variously subdivided this band of small irregularly shaped spaces. Room XXVII apparently served as the primary entrance to the house: two doorways once opened from the street to the south, while through its north doorway one reached the central Court XII. At one time Room XXVII was subdivided by a central partition. Its narrow western part may have functioned briefly as a small shop, independently accessible from the street and joined further west to an open area or garden (Space XXVIII) that gradually accumulated domestic debris. By the late fifth century this parti? tion had been removed and the more westerly street doorway blocked. In the latter phase a short row of steps rose to the now higher level of Space XXVIII. The floor of Room XXVII was roughly paved, in? cluding a reused block bearing two lines of Greek text commemorating the mystai of Zeus (IN91.10= S91.5/9919). In its final phase a short section of a column shaft rolled against the east wall apparently served as a makeshift bench at the entrance to the domus. Room XXVI is a 4.1 x 2.5 m trapezoidal space squeezed between the street wall and the large Room X to the north. Above its well- preserved plaster floor traces of painted plaster sur- vive on the walls. A shallow 2.0 x 0.4 m alcove in the south wall faces the doorway to Room X and might have contained a kline or cabinet.</page><page sequence="13">10 GREENEWALT, RATTE, AND RAUTMAN AASOR 52 Fig. 9. Sector MMS, Late Roman Rooms VIII, XXIV, XXV, looking west. Rooms VIII, XXIV and XXV make up a suite of large spaces paved with marble and enclosed by plastered walls (fig. 9). With an excavated area of almost 40 m2, Room XXV is one of the sector's largest interior spaces. The partially cleared room probably continues south to the street wall. At its northwest corner stood a water basin, preserved to? day only in foundations but with an original capac- ity of some 425 liters. From that space one entered Room VIII through a broad opening flanked by narrow piers. Room VIII's north wall apparently contained cupboards that faced the broad doorway to Room XXIV to the south. Room VIII was simi? larly furnished with a marble paved floor, plastered walls, and at its southwest corner a marble-lined water basin of perhaps 440 liters. Immediately to the west of Room XXIV stands Room XXII, a small, trapezoidal space of approxi? mately 12 m2 (fig. 10). Two openings in the street wall suggest that in the early fifth century c.e. this space may have served as a vestibule giving access to Rooms VIII, XXIV, and XXV to the east, and the small Room XXIII to the north. At a later date these streetside entrances were closed off and a small la? trine was installed at the room's southwest corner. Figure 11 reconstructs the facility with a single seat of wood or stone. The latrine was supplied by the overflow from the water tank in Room XXIV, which drained through a horizontal wall pipe in the south wall into a short open trough formed by an inverted roof cover tile, before continuing to the latrine it? self. A marble floorboard preserves cuttings for a gentle flow of water and a receptical for the requi- site sponge. From there water emptied through the tiled latrine box into a deep, well-built drain be? neath the floor. A stone platform nearby may at one time have supported a companion water basin. By the later sixth century the latrine niche had been filled with unmortared rubble and a small hearth stood in the room's northwest corner (Greenewalt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994: 10). Room XXIII is a small, enclosed space north of Room XXII. Excavation below its final floor revealed a dense sequence of occupation layers similar to those in Room IV (pp. 8-9). Several small pits and construction trenches accompanied the installation of new walls and successive lines of terracotta pipe through the space to supply the basin in Room XXIV. Briefly communicating with Room X to the east, Room XXIII apparently served for most of its life as a storage chamber (Greenewalt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994: 10). MMS/S. The broad, colonnaded street border- ing the MMS houses also separates that sector from MMS/S, which includes the street's south portico and the hill rising behind it. Previous work on the hill's north and east slopes identified Archaic, Hel? lenistic, and Roman remains that mostly predate the street's construction in the early fifth century c.e. Excavation in 1990 and 1991 continued to ex- plore the area's early history and its transformation during late antiquity (fig. 12). A group of small, rectilinear buildings crowned the north edge of the MMS/S ridge in the fourth century c.e. Known only by their foundations, the northernmost spaces were cut by construction of the tall south street</page><page sequence="14">1994 THE SARDIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1990 AND 1991 11 Fig. 10.

Several parts of the complex were reoccupied dur? ing the fifth to seventh centuries. Those spaces stood high above the street surface and looked across it to the north. From the roadway one entered through the arched streetside doorway and turned left to climb a 1.5-m-wide flight of steps behind the street wall. Carefully built of bricks and reused marble blocks, these fourteen steps rose 4.4 m to a packed earthen landing. Turning west, one continued to a small, vaulted space. This 3.0 x 2.3 m room was trapezoidal and had small corner piers sup? porting a low cross vault. Few traces survive of the room's original function. Beneath the plaster floor against the east wall was an infant burial. Pottery and a half-follis of Anastasius (512-518 c.e., 1990.283) indi? cate that the space remained open into the sixth century. A larger room at the sector's northeast corner was partially cleared in an earlier season (Greene? walt et al. 1983: 8). Renewed excavation in 1991 exposed this spacious (4.0 x 7.5 m) oblong space to its final occupation phase (fig. 13). Below the room's final floor level lie earlier walls and sur? faces, some of which may predate the construction of the nearby street wall. The room was substan- tially rebuilt, apparently in the fifth century, with brick and rubble walls rising to a height of over 2.5 m. Two doorways opened to the east, one lo? cated next to the street wall, the other near the room's center; the second doorway, with a thresh? old, was closed during the room's final phases. A broad 2.3 x 1.1 m alcove in the south wall was cov? ered by a shallow barrel vault and might have con? tained a kline or cupboard. The room was neatly paved with terracotta tiles and its plastered walls carried painted bands and floral patterns. While lacking other furniture, such arrangements suggest the room served as a cubiculum. Coins of Phocas indicate that the space remained open into the early seventh century (607/608 c.e., C79.23; 602-610 c.e., 1991.67, 1991.95). Another group of Roman spaces stood 10 to 30 m to the south along the lower east slope of the MMS/S ridge. Two parallel foundations set about 4 m apart follow the hill's north-south contours and support a terrace that steps down to the east, enclosing within their mass the Archaic wall (be? low, p. 19). Between the two foundations traces of perpendicular walls survive, together with frag? mentary tile and opus sectile floors; several lines of</page><page sequence="15">12 GREENEWALT, RATT6, AND RAUTMAN AASOR 52 + 4- -f -f- -f -t- street + ? -f- -f- / + ? + ~ MMS-III Ond MMS-SOUTH ROMAN FEATURES PLAN Fig. 12.

Sector MMS/S, Hellenistic Material Mixed fills in sector MMS/S contained a signifi? cant quantity of Hellenistic pottery, which included fragments of relief bowls (four inventoried), of molds for relief bowls (eight inventoried) and for a lamp, of terracotta figurines (twelve inventoried), of West Slope and related painted wares (two invento? ried), of echinus bowls (five inventoried), and of fish plates (one inventoried). Contemporaneous ar? chitectural features were negligible. Sector MMS, MMS/S, MMS/N, Archaic Features The principal Archaic feature exposed in exca? vation was the huge building called "Colossal Ly? dian Structure." Its length was traced for another 36 m (15 m to the south, 21 m to the north), making a total traced length of 130 m, not counting topo? graphical evidence for continuation to the south (Greenewalt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994: 14-26; here fig. 2, lower right). The narrow proportions in addi? tion to the great thickness and massive construction of the Structure (Greenewalt, Sterud, and Belknap 1982: 18-24; Greenewalt et al. 1983: 1-8) are ad? ditional evidence that the Structure was a fortifica? tion wall, as discoverers Ramage and Ramage claimed in 1976. Similarities to another huge Ar? chaic building, of which side surfaces have been uncovered a few meters to the north, indicate that the wall continued north beyond a gate that sepa? rated two of its segments (figs. 14, 15). The follow? ing discussion proceeds from north to south. Sector MMS/N, Features. Excavation in 1990 and 1991 exposed the north end of the Structure, which is located north of the modern highway un? der the south colonnaded ambulatory of the Roman avenue (figs. 3, 14). Excavation exposed remains of the northwest corner, which included about 5 m of the west side and 15 m of the north side (from that corner), and a west extension aligned with the north side and exposed for 5 m from the corner (figs. 14-17). Only lower courses survive. The foundations consist of three or more courses of roughly-trimmed fieldstone; the corner stone6 is large and has an inset vertical arris at the corner (fig. 17). On the north side, the foundations support one or two courses of ashlar masonry in white limestone and sandstone, with chisel-drafted bor- ders and pick-dressed centers (figs. 16, 17).

At middle left, "shell walls" (Lydian West Wall, Wall Z) of the casemate wall gate blockage abut the north side of the Structure. Roman features are screened. on the left sides of three blocks (for their significance, see Ratte 1989: 50-53). Roughly-picked circles, with di? ameters of 0.045-0.06 m, occur on three blocks of the north side proper. The north side slopes down from east to west, and the lowest ashlar course was staggered in three steps along the north side proper and the western extension (and is missing for the highest, most east- erly step). These faces of the Structure are backed with a packing of fieldstones. Near the northwest corner, the packing was disturbed in Roman times Fig. 17. Sector MMS/N, view looking south. Colossal Ly? dian Structure: northwest corner abutted by the west ex? tension (right). and is also intruded by the Roman trapezoidal foun? dation (built of limestone blocks that were evidently reused from the Structure, above, p. 7; fig. 16). Out? side the western extension, a surface of mortared stones that abuts the lowest exposed course of the extension (fig. 17) and on which rested Roman pot? tery fragments, also attests Roman intrusion in the Structure. A short but massive "casemate wall," formed by two stone "shell walls," each ca. 3.5 m thick (Ly? dian West Wall, Wall Z), and an intermediate fill of gravel, blocked the space between Colossal Ly? dian Structure and the large Archaic building with W-shaped, zig-zag facade, i.e., Lydian East Wall- Lydian Sandstone Wall, to the north (fig. 15).</page><page sequence="20">1994 THE SARDIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1990 AND 1991 17 When those features were last reported their interpre? tation as components of a casemate wall was posed as a question (Greenewalt et al. 1983: 14); without further evidence or discussion, it has come to be assumed (e.g., Greenewalt 1989: 265). Remains of the south end of the casemate wall were excavated in 1991. The two "shell walls" abut the north side of Colossal Lydian Structure (the west face of the more westerly wall, i.e., Ly? dian West Wall, however, had been destroyed, probably during building in Roman times; fig. 16); and some of the gravel fill also ran up against the north side of the Structure. A widespread deposit of debris that consists pri? marily of reddish crushed and fragmentary brick rests immediately north of Colossal Lydian Struc? ture, running up against its north side and underly- ing parts of the casemate wall that were exposed in 1991 (i.e., both "shell walls" and gravel fill). What appears to be the same debris had previously been noticed west of the casemate wall (Greenewalt, Sterud, and Belknap 1982: 20) and south of the large Archaic building with zig-zag facade (Lydian East Wall-Lydian Sandstone Wall), at its eastern end where it is closest to Colossal Lydian Structure, and had been tentatively identified as "Brick Fall," i.e., debris that consists predominantly of brick and is evidently remains of Colossal Lydian Structure superstructure that had been destroyed and dumped in the mid-sixth century b.c.e., presumably when Sardis fell to the armies of Cyrus the Great of Persia (Cahill in Greenewalt, Cahill, and Rautman 1987: 22-24; Greenewalt 1992b: 8). The deposit encoun? tered in 1991 was only partly excavated, and its identity as Brick Fall was not established. Sector MMS/N, Interpretation of Features. Simi? larities in orientation and construction (i.e., with distinctively-dressed ashlar masonry in limestone and sandstone) between the north side of Colossal Lydian Structure and the large building with zig- zag facade to the north (Lydian East Wall-Lydian Sandstone Wall; figs. 14-17; cf. Greenewalt, Ca? hill, and Rautman 1987: 31-33, figs. 14-16) indi? cate a close relationship between the two buildings that is consistent with the interpretation of them as forming two sides of a gate, and of the large build? ing with zig-zag facade as a continuation of the Co? lossal Lydian Structure fortification wall. The wall at MMS/N had been "shaved down" by later build? ing, probably that ofthe Roman avenue; and the ab? sence of topographic evidence for the wall for the next 100 m to the north (i.e., in contrast to the evi? dence of the mounds created by Colossal Lydian Structure in the modern landscape south of the modern highway; fig. 2, foregound) may also be ex? plained as a consequence of post-Archaic building, probably that ofthe Roman Bath-Gymnasium com? plex. The chain of mounds that extends eastward from the northeast corner of the Bath-Gymnasium complex (figs. 1, 2) is created at least in part by the ruins of a huge Lydian building (faced with ashlar masonry in white limestone; Greenewalt, Cahill, and Rautman 1987: 80-84); the chain may repre? sent continuation of the same fortification wall to which Colossal Lydian Structure and the building with zig-zag facade belong, and may have provided a precedent for the Late Roman line of defense that was built against the north side of those mounds (Hanfmann and Waldbaum 1975: 37, where the mound chain is called "terrace of earth and fill"). Whether that interpretation conflicts with the nature of Archaic occupation at sectors HoB and PN (fig. 1, nos. 4, 10), which would have been located outside the fortifications, and with the apparent im- plication in Herodotus's account (5.101) that the central part of Sardis flanked the Pactolus stream remains to be discussed. Today the stream flows some 400 m west of Colossal Lydian Structure.7 The defenses to which the Structure belongs may have enclosed only part of the lower city of Sardis (like the inner citadel at Carchemish); is it reason? able to suppose that it excluded the "market" and houses at sector HoB, the gold-refining installations at sector PN, and the residential zone and agora known to Herodotus?8 If the debris that underlies the casemate wall is Brick Fall, the casemate wall must be later than the great destruction of Colossal Lydian Structure and presumably postdates the Persian conquest of ca. 546 b.ce. (the casemate wall had previously been understood to be a pre-destruction feature). It would have been built to block the gate; but it is blockage in the sense of a major, long-term renovation that eliminated the gate and extended the fortification across the gate passage. Is it a reflection of adminis? trative change from Lydian to Persian rule? The ac- commodation of traffic from one side of the defenses to the other in the locale remains to be determined. The function of the west extension of the north side of the Structure is unclear. Figure 15 suggests that it was a retaining wall for the earthwork/glacjs on the west side of the Structure proper, and is the counterpart of the retaining wall 60 m to the south (i.e., which forms the north side of the recess in</page><page sequence="21">18 GREENEWALT, RATTfi, AND RAUTMAN AASOR 52 Fig. 18. Sector MMS/S A, view looking south. Colossal Lydian Structure: mudbrick west face (diagonal arrow), surface of Brick Fall (on which excavator sits), and post- destruction west face in three superimposed planes (the uppermost, largely concealed behind Roman Brick con? struction, is indicated by two arrows). In the foreground, Roman wall-like feature and stones. which helmet and skeleton were recovered in 1987 and 1988; Greenewalt 1990: 10-14; Greenewalt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994: 20-21). The obtuse angle of the northwest corner of the Structure proper is unusual for gate design, and may indicate that the east-west route through the gate passage (attested by gravel surfaces as well as by the passage space; Greenewalt et al. 1983: 14-15) is older than the fortification wall. The orientation of the wall in this locale might have been determined by topographical factors. Sector MMS. The east face of Colossal Lydian Structure was traced for another 3.3 m, about 10 m south of the shallow recess near the Archaic residen? tial complex (fig. 14; i.e., at ca. S. 84-88 on the 'B' grid, fig. 14, and below Late Roman Space XXVIII, figs. 3, 7). In this locale, the east face had been exposed for a length of ca. 2 m in previous excavation (Greenewalt, Rautman and Meric 1986: 6). Of the adjacent segment exposed in 1991, only the top preserved two courses and the undistributed top of Brick Fall (above, p. 17, MMS/N) to the east were excavated. One of several instances of interrelation between the Structure and Late Roman features occurs in this locale. The east face of the Structure continues to the north through an arched opening in the north wall of the Late Roman colonnaded street. Similarly, the west face of the Structure passed through an opening in the same wall, further to the west.9 Another instance is the coincidence of location between a change of design and construction in the east face of the Structure (sloped and mudbrick on relatively low stone socle; vertical and stone) and a ma? jor wall of the late Roman residential complex (the mas- sive north wall of Rooms IX and XI (Greenewalt et al. 1985: 73; see also Rautman in Greenewalt, Cahill, and Rautman 1987: 18). Those interrelations cannot all be fortuitous; for reasons that remain to be determined, Late Roman construction to some extent accommodated in its design the Archaic remains below. Sector MMS/S. Significant features of Colos? sal Lydian Structure excavated in Sector MMS/S included a rectilinear recess on the east side, thick deposits of Brick Fall (above, p. 17, MMS/N) on both sides and considerable amounts of carbonized wood directly under Brick Fall on one side, and remains of the post-destruction rebuilt Structure. Those features appear in a 35 m-long stretch where excavation focused on three locales, from north to south, A,B,C (originally separate trenches; fig. 14). In MMS/S A, both sides of the preserved top of the Structure were uncovered. The width at the preserved top is ca. 8 m (narrower by a meter than the preserved top of the Structure 55 m to the north, at the north end of the MMS hill; Greene? walt et al. 1983: 2). In MMS/S A, both sides as far as exposed are mudbrick. The west face is vertical, unlike other mudbrick faces of the Structure, which have a distinct batter. A 3 m-long segment of west face was excavated to a depth of 3 m be? low preserved top; the face is covered with mud plaster, as was determined in a small cut through the face (at the southeast corner of the trench), where the plaster, 0.015 m thick, and brick out- lines behind the plaster were revealed in section (fig. 19). The east face of the Structure in MMS/S is problematic.</page><page sequence="22">1994 THE SARDIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1990 AND 1991 19 Fig. 19. Sector MMS/S A, view looking south. Colossal Lydian Structure: mudbrick west face (at left and behind excavator), with mud plaster exposed, where it has been sectioned in the scarp, as a narrow, light-colored line (arrow). Brick Fall appears in the scarp ("strata" being brushed by excava? tor) and under excavator (where it remains unexcavated). In MMS/S A and B, a more-or-less continuous line of mudbrick facing was traced for ca. 15 m (north of the re? cess; fig. 14), but apart from a short 2.3 m-long stretch where the face was exposed to a height of 18 courses and 1.7 m below preserved top (between ca. S. 130-133 on the 'B' grid), only one or two courses of facing were rec? ognized. In front of those courses at lower levels oc? curred clear evidence of construction in situ: patches of laid brick; two "walls" made of loosely-aligned bricks, one brick wide and two or three bricks high, oriented roughly perpendicular to the east side of the Structure; and, at the deepest level penetrated in excavation, ca. 2 m east from the "face," a deposit of river stone packing. In MMS/S C, a mass of coursed mudbrick construc? tion was located in the west half of the trench (i.e., up to ca. E. 100 on the *B' grid) but no face was recognized. In earthy fill to the east, occasional mudbrick fragments were detected; and at the deepest level a surface of river stone packing similar to that of MMS/S A was exposed. For those features there are several possible expla- nations. In MMS/S A, the face might be at the line of mudbricks, and construction below too loose or sandy (because of being in pis6 as well as poor-quality mud? brick?) for recognition; and the feature in front might be a bulwark or glacis. The two "walls" have close paral? lels in the earthwork on the east side of the Structure (Greenewalt et al. 1990: 142-43). Alternatively, the east side of the Structure might have contained a high step or shelf (like one for which there is evidence in the west side, Greenewalt et al. 1990: 114), in which the lines of bricks belong to the upper "back" face and the built fea? tures in front are core materials behind the lower "front" face. The river stone packing in MMS/S A and C might be backing for a stone face that is an extension of the east face located 38 m to the north in sector MMS (above p. 18); and is connected to the face of the recess in MMS/S B (below, this page). Above the river stone packing in MMS/S C, construction materials of the Structure would appear to have been disturbed (perhaps during creation of the Late Roman triple apse building [cf. figs. 14, 3]). Sector MMS/S, Recess. The northwest corner of the recess was partly excavated in 1989 (Greene? walt, Ratte\ and Rautman 1994: 23-24). In 1990 and 1991 more ofthe inner end was excavated. Pre? served tops of the sides were exposed to determine width and construction features; the north side was exposed to its full preserved height for a short stretch of 1.5 m (fig. 21); and ca. 10 m2 of the floor (1.0-3.5 m east-west by 5 m north-south, against the north face) were excavated. The faces at the in? ner end were not fully exposed, partly to obtain sec? tions through Brick Fall that filled the recess (below, p. 20) and partly to protect the stone faces from deterioration, because at the preserved top the stone faces showed cracks and signs of softening, apparently the result of exposure to heat. (Traces of burning were noticed on the top surfaces of stones of the north face [Greenewalt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994: 24]. Signs of deterioration were not noticed, however, in lower parts of the north face that were exposed.) The outer end of the recess is blocked by an apse of the Late Roman triple-apse building at the east end of the trench (figs. 3, 14). The recess is 6.65 m wide, has vertical sides, and is faced with stone?roughly dressed blocks of schist and quartzite, as observed in 1989. The preserved top of the back face was 7 m above the recess floor. The uppermost four to five courses (together ca. 1 m high) had become dislocated,</page><page sequence="23">20 GREENEWALT, RATT?, AND RAUTMAN AASOR 52 Fig. 20. Sector MMS/S A, view looking north.

The side faces of the recess appear to abut the back face. The relationship of the re? cess to the fabric of the Structure remains to be determined.10 The floor of the recess evidently consisted of sandy soil. Sector MMS/S, Brick Fall. The Brick Fall was exposed and excavated west of the west face of the Structure in MMS/S A, and in the recess of the east face (MMS/S B). From the Brick Fall itself, chro? nologically diagnostic material was not recovered (for diagnostic material recovered elsewhere in Brick Fall, Greenewalt and Heywood 1992: 3). In MMS/S A, the top of the Brick Fall deposit11 sloped down more or less evenly from the east face (fig. 18). Part of it, against the Structure face at the south end of the trench, was excavated to a depth of 2 m below the preserved top against the face; the section through it in the south trench scarp shows internal "strata" sloped down to the east (fig. 19). At the south end of the trench, Brick Fall appeared to be undisturbed. Further north, however, is a short wall-like feature of field stones (ca. 3.20 m long by 1.05 m wide by 1.75 m high) that was surrounded by Brick Fall (figs. 18, 20). A fragment of coarse ripple-ware pottery recovered inside it and coarse mortar that adhered to many of its stones suggest that the wall-like feature was created in Roman times. For post- Archaic disturbance of the earthy fill that rested directly over the south half to two-thirds of the wall-like feature, however, the only other evidence that was recognized was a lamp of Hellenistic type.12 In the recess, Brick Fall was removed to floor level in a space ca. 1.0-3.5 m east-west by 5 m north-south against the north face. That space was excavated ca. 1 m from the back face to make a section across the width of the recess (fig. 21, left), and ca. 1.65 m from the south face, to make a section perpendicular to the back face. The section across the width (which was made in 1990) showed brick debris sloped down from either side to? ward center; the incline from the south indicated the existence and proximity of the south face (which was located in 1991). The section perpendicular to the back face showed the debris sloped down from the back; as in other recesses of the Structure (Greenewalt, Cahill, and Rautman 1987: 23, fig. 7; Greenewalt and Heywood 1992: 4, fig. 4). Resting on the floor of the recess underneath Brick Fall was a considerable amount of carbon? ized wood. When located at the end of the 1990 season, it was left in situ to be excavated the fol? lowing year by P. I. Kuniholm and his staff of the Aegean Dendrochronology Project. Although the wood remains were covered with a layer of earth and a roof, by 1991 they had become too soft from (ground?) moisture for removal in entirety or for removal of reconstructable pieces. All wood exam? ined by Kuniholm and his staff was oak. To Kuni? holm, its thorough carbonization suggested that a time interval of at least a few days had elapsed be? tween the burning of the wood and its burial under Brick Fall. From the floor of the recess, underneath the wood remains, were recovered a few pottery fragments; for the most part they were ordinary plain wares (banded skyphoi), but they included one small fragment with</page><page sequence="24">1994 THE SARDIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1990 AND 1991 21 Fig. 21.

Brick Fall (left) has been sectioned parallel to the back wall of the recess. orientalizing animal figure decoration, which pro- vides further evidence that pottery with such decora? tion continued to circulate at Sardis as late as the middle of the sixth century b.c.e.13 Sector MMS/S, Post-destruction Rebuilding. In MMS/S A and B, stone construction of small-to- middle-sized field stones and small-sized blocks of sandstone and marble (some reused), set dry or in mud mortar, evidently belongs to a rebuilding of the Structure after the destruction of the mid-sixth century b.c.e. The date of the construction, which included two or more phases, was not determined; because of loose association with pottery of Ar? chaic and Classical types it is presumed to fall within the later sixth-to-fourth centuries b.ce. In fig. 14, the construction is shaded with diagonal lines, like the "Secondary Limestone Wall" in see- Fig. 22.

There are two east faces; the outer, which has a short return that abuts the inner, is evidently the later of the two. Of the west face there are three surerimposed planes (fig. 18): an upper face 2.5 m high, with pre? served top less than 0.50 m below modern ground sur? face (indicated by two arrows in fig. 18); a middle face ca. 1 m to the west and 0.7 m high; and a lower face slightly recessed behind the middle face and ca. 1 m high.

METROON PARASTADES The architectural role of ten marble blocks that had been reused in the Late Roman Synagogue and that had originally belonged to parastades of a Metroon (the word parastada appears in one of the Greek texts of Hellenistic correspondence that are inscribed on several blocks; Gauthier 1989) was discussed in Greenewalt 1990: 20-21. Because of the treatment of their sides, the blocks were pre- sumed to belong to piers that projected at right an- gles from one or more wall surfaces. Since anta blocks in Andron B, i.e., the Andron of Mausolus, at Labraunda (Hellstrom and Thieme 1981) have the same treatment, however, it is more reasonable to suppose that the Sardis blocks belonged to an- tae, the common meaning of parastades, in a Metroon of conventional Greek megaron design. C.H.G. SECTOR BYZFORT After a hiatus of one season in 1990, excavation at Sector ByzFort?the flat-topped spur or foothill crowned by a large Archaic terrace on the lower north slope of the acropolis?was resumed for one and one-half months in 1992 (the spur is located at ca. E. 630-730 / S. 310-340 on the 'B' grid). The</page><page sequence="26">1994 THE SARDIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1990 AND 1991 23 ar ?*??

Sector ByzFort, plans of trenches dug in 1988-1989 and 1991 in concavity on east side of hill. goals of this season's work were to finish two projects started in 1988 and 1989: the exploration of the spur's east side, and the excavation of a se? quence of Archaic deposits on the summit of the spur. The completion of those projects brings the program of investigation of Sector ByzFort, begun in 1983, to an end; no further digging is planned (for results of previous work, Greenewalt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994: 26-3land references). East Side In 1988 and 1989, a 4 x 10 m trench was dug into the east side of the hill, roughly halfway be? tween the northeast corner of the Archaic terrace and the southernmost exposed section of the ter- race's east face, for the purpose of investigating a concave dip or depression that interrupts the hill- side at this point (the trench was located on the south side of this concavity at E. 718-722 / S. 416-426 on the 'B' grid; fig. 23). The trench re? vealed the south edge of what appeared to be a street running uphill from east to west (elevation approximately 188 m above sea level), and, facing the street, part of a building 6 m wide, nestled against the base of a tall retaining wall (preserved height, 5.5 m above the level of the street; fig. 24). Pottery and coins found beneath the floors of the building facing the street suggested a date in the fifth century c.e. Further excavation showed that this late Roman building rested partly on undisturbed soil, partly on top of an earlier structure?a mas- sive foundation built of sandstone blocks?whose date and function remained unclear. In 1991, a second 4 x 10 m trench was opened up 2 m north of the trench dug in 1988 and 1989 (location of the new trench: E. 708-712 / S. 404- 414; fig. 23). This trench revealed the north edge of the Roman street (thus shown to be roughly 5 m wide) and on the north side of the street, part of another Roman building (figs. 24, 25). The Roman building comprised two distinct areas: to the south, a room with a tile floor approximately 1 m below street level and a door opening through its south wall onto the street; to the north, on the other side of a party wall, an unconnected room whose tile floor lay 1.6 m below the floor level of the south room. A notable feature of the north room is a pair</page><page sequence="27">24 GREENEWALT, RATTfi, AND RAUTMAN AASOR 52 *M Fig. 25. Sector ByzFort, view of trench dug in 1991 in concavity on east side of hill, looking south. of large basins or tanks, built up against the room's south wall (capacities of basins ca. 1250 liters each; cf. the basins excavated at Sector MMS in 1985 [Greenewalt, Rautman, and Cahill 1987: 57- 60]; p. 10 here). The floors of these basins are paved with schist slabs; their sides are lined with terracotta tiles. The basins are connected by a pipe running through the party wall that divides them. A second pipe in the north wall of the west basin may have been used for drainage. A pilgrim flask containing a small hoard of 71 bronze coins, most of the late fifth century c.e., was found beneath the floor of the south room (fig. 26).15 Further excavation both in this area and beneath the street uncovered a complex network of pipes and drains; especially notable is a large covered drain 0.7 m wide and 0.75-1.0 m high, running beneath the street. These waterworks were set in mixed fill, beneath which lay undisturbed soil sloping down from north to south at elevations 2-5 m below street level. Apart from a single Ar- Fig. 26. Pilgrim flask (P91.10/9859) with hoard of bronze coins (1991.467-537) from Sector ByzFort. chaic potsherd, no traces of earlier occupation were revealed. The structures on both sides of the street thus appear to rest on a series of terraces climbing up the south side of the concavity that interrupts the ByzFort hill's east slope. The sandstone foundation uncovered in 1988 and 1989 beneath the building on the uphill side of the street remains enigmatic, and it is possible that these terraces predate, at least in part, the late Roman structures they support. But it so, the later construction has almost entirely obliterated the earlier structures and strata, and it is also possible that the east edge of the ByzFort hill originally?and in the Archaic period?formed a straight line, and that the present concavity is en? tirely the result of post-Archaic erosion and late Roman building. After excavation and recording were finished, the trenches dug in 1988, 1989, and 1991 on the east side of the hill were filled in. Spur Summit In 1989, excavation on top of the hill revealed a narrow stone (marble and sandstone) foundation or stylobate?Archaic in date and belonging perhaps to the porch of a small building or pavilion?resting in part on the fill of a large square pit (3.5 m along a side and 2.2 m deep; these features are located at ca. E. 671-676 / S. 348-352 on the 'B' grid; figs. 23, 27); included in the fill of this pit or cellar was a rich deposit of Lydian pottery, debatable to the mid- seventh century b.c.e. The goals of excavation in 1991 were to date the Archaic stylobate more pre- cisely and to dig more of the seventh century b.c.e. pottery deposit in the fill of the cellar.</page><page sequence="28">1994 THE SARDIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1990 AND 1991 25 * ? % ?/?

Anathyrosis on the joint of one of the blocks of the stylobate, re? vealed when two of the stylobate blocks were re? moved so that more of the fill of the cellar could be excavated, also indicates a sixth rather than a seventh century date (Ratte 1989: 86). The deposit of seventh century b.c.e. pottery in the fill of the cellar was contained in a layer of de? bris 0.3-0.7 m above the cellar floor. Excavation in 1991 showed that this layer rested on top of a fallen mudbrick wall that had tumbled face down into the cellar from the south (fig. 28). Nineteen courses of bricks (0.36 m long, 0.24 m wide, and 0.08 m thick) were preserved, five bricks wide at the widest point. The wall was only one brick thick; the bricks were separated by thin layers of mud mortar, and the face of the wall bore a thin layer of mud plaster. The fallen mudbrick wall proved in turn to rest on a second layer of debris, which itself lay directly on the floor of the cellar. The two debris layers differed in the types of pottery recovered from them. The lower layer con? tained mostly large, undecorated storage vessels; the upper layer contained painted jars (a composite drawing of one such bichrome jar, restored from fragments of at least two different vessels, is illus? trated in fig. 29),16 and painted gray and mono? chrome dishes (Greenewalt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994: 32, fig. 26). Presumably the lower debris layer represents the contents of the cellar before the collapse of the mudbrick wall, and the upper layer includes debris tossed or fallen in from above. The pottery from both layers was, however,</page><page sequence="30">1994 THE SARDIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1990 AND 1991 27 Fig. 30.

The paucity of re? storable vessels suggests that both the cellar and the living or working spaces above and around it had been cleaned out, or abandoned for some time before the mudbrick wall and the debris on top of it fell into the cellar. Large postholes dug in the corners of the cellar, in the middle of each wall, and in the center of the floor, suggest that the building to which the cellar belonged rose at least one story above ground level. The mudbrick wall fallen into the cellar may have formed the south wall of the structure. The absence of any trace of the foundations of this wall suggests that the area around the cellar was leveled off at some later date. The superstructure of the cellar may not have been walled in on its east, north, and west sides?thus requiring posts in the absence of walls to carry the roof. Figure 30 offers a conjectural restoration of this structure.17 The results of excavation on the ByzFort summit in 1991 help to refine the chronology of Archaic occupation and construction proposed in Greene? walt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994: 29-31. Thus the cellar belongs to an initial building phase of the mid-seventh century b.ce. A second building phase of the late seventh or early sixth century is repre? sented by the large stone foundation built partly into the east half of the cellar, and by the leveling of the undisturbed soil around these features. The Archaic terrace wall that encloses the ByzFort hill on its north and east sides belongs to a third building phase of the mid-sixth century; the stylobate on the top of the hill apparently belongs to the same phase. The nature of the Archaic occupation of this sector remains enigmatic. In most places, later construction has erased all but the foundations of the Archaic structures, and in the areas exposed, plans of the buildings to which these foundations belong have proved impossible to recognize. Exca? vation of the area south of the trenches on the sum? mit of the spur might yield more definitive results, but that area is impractically large. (It is an excel- lent candidate, however, for nonintrusive, subsur? face surveying.) For these reasons, excavation of Sector ByzFort, now that the specific projects be- gun in earlier seasons have all been completed, has been called to a halt. GRAVES AT SARDIS, BIN TEPE, AND ENVIRONS Pyramid Tomb The so-called Pyramid Tomb is a small limestone structure on the northwest slope of the acropolis of</page><page sequence="31">28 GREENEWALT, RATTfi, AND RAUTMAN AASOR 52 Fig. 31. Pyramid Tomb, general view. Sardis (fig. 31). The Pyramid Tomb was initially discovered in 1914 by the first American Expedition to Sardis (Butler 1922: 155-66, 167-70), rediscov- ered and reexcavated in 1960-1961 and 1969 by the current Harvard/Cornell project (Hanfmann 1983: 42 and references). A new study of the tomb was undertaken in 1990 in order to reexamine the monu- ment in the light of recent discoveries, and to com- pile a new set of architectural drawings. After excavation, the tomb was partially reburied to pro? tect it from weathering and vandalism. As preserved, the tomb is a stepped platform, resembling the lower part of a stepped pyramid, 7.5 m2 at foundation level. Above the foundations, the structure steps in evenly on all sides, rising over six steps to a maximum height of 1.9 m. The only remains of the superstructure of the tomb are a stone pavement, found by the first Sardis Expedi? tion in the center of the tomb at the level of the top of the fifth step, and two wall blocks. Setting lines incised in the surface of the pavement indicate the positions of the walls of the tomb chamber to which the pavement and the two surviving wall blocks belonged. The dimensions of the chamber as measured from the setting lines are 1.46 x 2.26 m, from which figures it is possible to infer a foot measure of approximately 0.324 m. Thus the chamber measured 4.5 feet by 7 feet, and each of the steps of the tomb was roughly 1 foot high and 1 foot deep. The tomb may be restored, as originally sug? gested by H. C. Butler, after the model of the tomb of Cyrus at Pasargadae (Butler 1922: 166, ill. 185, 168-70);18 a new such restoration is illustrated in fig. 32. If, as seems likely, the Pyramid Tomb is a product of the same "Graeco-Persian" cultural movement that produced the tomb of Cyrus, it would presumably postdate the fall of Sardis in ca. 546 b.c.e.; if it is actually a copy of Cyrus's tomb, it would likely postdate the death of that king in ca. 530 b.c.e. In any event, the Pyramid Tomb may be more generally and independently dated within the sixth century on the basis of its masonry; espe? cially diagnostic is the absence of any evidence for the use of the claw chisel, which indicates a termi? nus ante quem of ca. 500 b.c.e. (Nylander 1970: 53-56; Stronach 1978: 99-100); for a fuller report on the reexcavation of the Pyramid Tomb, see Ratte, 1992. Karniyarik Tepe The burial mound known as Karniyarik Tepe (diameter: 220 m, height: 50 m) is one of the largest mounds at Bin Tepe, the great tumulus cemetery in the Hermus plain opposite Sardis (fig. 33). In the mid-1960s, the Sardis Expedition devoted three field seasons to the exploration by tunneling of the interior of this mound (Hanfmann 1983: 57-58 and references); 65 m in from the edge of the mound, the excavators encountered a curving limestone wall, which seems to describe the circumference of a circle concentric with the outside of the tumulus (fig. 34). This wall is thus apparently the retaining wall or "crepis" of an earlier and smaller tumulus, buried beneath the present mound. Although the</page><page sequence="32">1994 THE SARDIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1990 AND 1991 29 (^VT^i ITT , l-U- i.----h--ir :^SL H?zi -E-Xl ?'? '.mT^^A i ' i ' !-'.'.'

On the basis of a reference in a fragment of verse attributed to Hipponax (Degani 1983: 30-32, fr. 7) and of a symbol inscribed in numerous places on the face of the interior crepis wall (fig. 34), ten- tatively identified as a royal monogram, G. M. A. Hanfmann suggested that Karniyarik Tepe was the tomb of Gyges, who died in the mid-seventh century b.c.e. (Hanfmann 1965: 34). Hanfmann's identification was, however, speculative (the asso? ciation with the poem by Hipponax depends on an</page><page sequence="33">30 GREENEWALT, RATT?, AND RAUTMAN AASOR 52 Fig. 33.

"HANDUNO BOSS uncertain emendation, and the reading of the sym? bol inscribed on the face of the crepis wall has been contested by no less an authority than R. Gus- mani [1975: 69-70 and references]). Other evi? dence, especially the masonry of the crepis wall, indicates a sixth rather than a seventh century date. In 1991, a new study of the crepis wall was un- dertaken in order to reexamine and record the tech? nical details that indicate a later date; these include handling bosses, prymarks, a joining technique simi? lar in some respects to anathyrosis, and very fine bevels or chamfers cut in both the horizontal and vertical edges of the blocks (fig. 34). The earliest securely datable monuments in Lydia that exhibit comparable details are the tomb of Alyattes (Ratte 1989: 7-15, 157-89; Greenewalt et al. 1983: 26-27; Hanfmann 1983: 56-57 and references) and the limestone and sandstone walls at Sector MMS/N (Ratte 1989: 22-23, 237-44; Greenewalt, Rautman, and Cahill 1987: 72-84; Greenewalt et al. 1983: 13-15), both of which probably belong to the first half of the sixth century; Greek architectural com? paranda such as the temple of Artemis at Ephesos (Hogarth 1908: 256-58, pl. 11; cf. Bammer 1988:</page><page sequence="34">1994 THE SARDIS CAMPAIGNS OF 1990 AND 1991 31 20-21) suggest a similar date. In addition to those architectural details, a new small find also indi? cates a date in the sixth century: a fragmentary stemmed dish found in the stone packing piled up behind the wall (figs. 35, 36).19 Many similar dishes were found in the mid-sixth century Persian destruction layer at Sector MMS (Greenewalt, Ca? hill, and Rautman 1987: 28 fig. 12). Thus the archaeological evidence suggests that Karniyarik Tepe in both its original and its enlarged forms should be dated roughly 50 to 100 years later than the death of Gyges. It is not impossible that Karniyarik Tepe was a cenotaph or memorial for Gyges, but it is more likely that it belongs to one of his descendants, not Alyattes, whose tomb is al? ready accounted for, or Croesus, who if he was bur? ied at Sardis was presumably denied the honor of a monument on this scale, but perhaps a prince?such as Atys, the elder son of Croesus?or princess of the royal house.20 Tumulus Tomb Near Sangah In July of 1990, several members of the Sardis Expedition visited a tumulus tomb (first noticed in 1989 on an expedition to a nearby marble quarry) in the region of the village of San^ali, between Golmarmara and Akhisar north of Sardis (fig. 37). The tumulus is approximately 50 m wide and 10 m high, and an open tunnel dug into the side of the mound gave access to a well preserved tomb cham? ber within. The tomb chamber is approached by an un- roofed dromos and a shallow antechamber, and is built of finely dressed and fitted marble blocks (figs. 38, 39). The chamber is oblong, with the en? trance centered in one of the long sides; its dimen- sions (1.45 x 2.60 m) are similar to those of the chamber of the Pyramid Tomb (1.46 x 2.26 m), and the same unit of measurement (a foot of 0.324 m) may have been used in both structures; thus this tomb chamber measures 4.5 feet from front to back and 8 feet in width. The chamber was partially filled with earth, so it was impossible to measure its full height; it is at least 1.85 m.

A missing wall block in one corner of the cham? ber led to an open space above the ceiling. This open space was, it seems, originally filled with rub? ble; above the rubble lay a thin deposit of fine lime mortar, surmounted by a thin layer of charcoal, and then a reed matting, of which the impression sur- vives in a layer of fine clay pressed on top (fig. 40).

NOTES Excavation and other projects were conducted by the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis, or Sardis Ex? pedition, which is jointly sponsored by the Harvard Uni? versity Art Museums, Cornell University, the American Schools of Oriental Research, and the Corning Museum of Glass. The Expedition is supported financially by many corporate and individual donors. The conservation program is supported by a grant from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation. Study projects connected with publi? cation of the results of fieldwork before 1977 are sup? ported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, a federal agency that supports study in such fields as art history, philosophy, literature, and languages. Field work was authorized in 1990 and 1991 by the General Directorate of Monuments and Museums, a division of the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Turkey. Each field season took place during three summer months. It is a pleasure to acknowledge fundamental permissions granted by the General Directorate of Monuments and Museums and the encouragement and support of its officers; especially Director General Mehmet Akif I?ik, Excavations Department Mehmet Yilmaz, and Excava? tions Branch Directors felik Topcu and Osman Ozbek. The Archaeological and Ethnographical Museum in Manisa also generously supported, assisted, and encour- aged Expedition projects; the Expedition is particularly grateful to Director Hasan Dedeoglu, Deputy Directors Fatma Bilgin and Mustafa Tumer, and curators Ilhami Bilgin, Rafet Dinc, and Mehmet Onder. The Government Representatives were Remzi Yagci (Museum of Anato- lian Civilizations, Ankara) in 1990 and Mustafa Samur (Kayseri Museum), Turhan Kayabey (Bahkesir Mu? seum), Omer f akir (Orodu Museum), and Emel Erten Yagci (General Directorate of Monuments and Muse? ums, Ankara) in 1991; their supportive advice and assis? tance greatly facilitated Expedition programs.

To all these for patience, hard work, high professional standards, and team spirit, hearty and heartfelt thanks. 2Conservation, in addition to routine treatment and mending of artifacts, included the following projects. Principal fragments of the Archaic iron and bronze hel? met that were recovered in 1987 and 1988 were mounted for exhibition (Greenewalt and Heywood 1992: figs. 6- 9). Broken parts of the southeast corner of the Pyramid Tomb were consolidated and restored in 1990. Painted plaster in a Late Roman room (cubiculum? sector MMS/S was consolidated and edged for protection in 1991. Ninety square meters of mosaic paving (in the south ambulatory of the Late Roman avenue, sector MMS/N) were lifted and stored for future backing. Three facsimile mosaic in? scriptions in the Late Roman Synagogue were repainted in 1990. Fourteen modern drainage sinks in the Syna? gogue were cleaned and refurbished in 1991. Other projects included graphic recording of the Ar? temis temple (by F. K. Yegul) and of Lydian masonry in Karniyank Tepe at Bin Tepe (by C. Ratte); studies of Iron Age stratification and pottery from sector HoB (by A. Ramage in 1990); of Attic pottery (by N. H. Ramage, 1990); of Hellenistic pottery (by S. I. Rotroff and A. Oli- ver, Jr., 1990); of the Archaic marble Cybele naiskos (by M. J. Rein, 1991); of Artemis temple capitals (by H. R. Goette, 1990); preliminary planning for reconstruction and site enhancement at sectors MMS, MMS/S, MMS/N (by A. B. Casendino in 1991); study of the Archaic iron and bronze helmet fragments, in preparation for a recon? struction by the Royal Armouries, H. M. Tower of Lon? don (by C. Smith and R. Smith, 1991). 3A pile of bricks stacked next to one column base and the absence of at least one stylobate block may re? flect the area's selective despoliation prior to the collapse of its superstructure. Like the main ambulatory, the inner portico apparently had an upper story which included spouted and opaion roof tiles (Greenewalt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994: 39 n. 6 for the date). 4 Area of text 2.55 x 1.55 m; height of letters 0.10- 0.15 m. This reading follows the preliminary analysis of the inscription by G. Umholtz and P. Herrmann. Two emboloi are mentioned in another Late Roman building inscription from western Sardis (IN68.18); see Greene? walt, Cahill, and Rautman 1987: 47 n. 8 with references. Flavius Archelaos, also a "companion of his serene highness" as well as a hegemon (commander), is named in a dated inscription of 349 c.e., from Radeime in Syria; see LAnnee Epigraphique 1933: 41 no. 171. P. Herr? mann, who acknowledges D. Hoffmann for this refer? ence, cautions that the name may not be very rare and that Flavius is a common name in late antiquity (per? sonal communication). 5 The presence of the street wall was anticipated by magnetometer prospection carried out in the area in 1985; see Greenewalt, Rautman, and Cahill 1987: 62, and for the street Greenewalt, Cahill, and Rautman 1987: 18-20. 6Whether the bottom course of the foundations was exposed any where in 1990 and 1991 is unclear. 7In excavation at sector HoB, 300 m west of the Archaic fortification, however, widespread deposits of water-laid gravel and sand in Archaic strata were inter- preted by excavator G. F. Swift, Jr., as the result of flooding by the Pactolus (Hanfmann 1966: 8; 1967: 32). If his interpretation is correct?as A. Ramage, who has reviewed the stratification history believes?the course of the Pactolus in the seventh and sixth centuries b.c.e. must have come significantly further to the east of its present course. 8On the reconciliation of ancient literary testimonia with archaeological evidence, G. M. A. Hanfmann (1983: 75) pithily observed ". . . no verbal picture can ever match the concreteness and complexity of material reali- ties. In this way, the spade is mightier than the word." 9This interrelation is not clearly described or illus? trated in published Sardis reports. The relevant segment of the west face is also the back wall of the recess from which the helmet and skeleton were recovered in 1987 and 1988; fig. 15. The face appears as a simple line run- ning diagonally through the opening in the north street wall in Greenewalt, Cahill, and Rautman 1987: 17 fig. 4 (at E. 108-109 / S. 93-96 on the CB' grid). The opening in the street wall (2.25 m. wide) is reported by Rautman, 18 (in Greenewalt, Cahill, and Rautman 1987); a seg? ment of the street wall west of the opening was dis- mantled in 1989, Rautman in Greenewalt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994: 11. A segment of Late Roman street wall east of the opening and the west face of Colossal Lydian structure (= back wall of the Structure recess) appear to? gether in Greenewalt and Heywood 1992: 3, fig. 3, and in Greenewalt 1992b: 10, fig. 7. 10 Some features, like the crude "face" oriented east- west within the Structure behind the recess (Greenewalt, Ratte, and Rautman 1994: 23-24) suggest several building phases. 11 The top of the Brick Fall was cleared for a space of about 10 m2; the trench scarp to the south (fig. 18) and Late Roman construction to the north and west (cf. figs. 3, 14) limited further excavation in those directions; and for safety reasons it seemed inadvisable to excavate signifi? cantly deeper than the lowest levels reached in 1991. 12Lamp L90.7/9786: with two narrow ridges and a collar around the filling hole; lug at proper right side to- wards front, long nozzle, no handle; poor glaze.

For dendrochrono- logical analysis of these pieces, see Huber 1992: 41-45. 18 Butler also proposed an alternative restoration of the tomb as a stepped pyramid; this intriguing but im- probable idea was developed by S.

The decoration consists of red glaze on the inside of the dish, on the outside of the rim, and on the lower part of the stem, with narrow bands painted on both the interior and the exterior in black over the red glaze, in a typical "black on red" style. 20According to Herodotus (1.34-46), Atys was killed in a hunting accident two years before Croesus began to prepare for war against Persia, thus in about 550 b.ce.

Long believed to be a Roman way-station on the route between the Nile and the Red Sea, the site can now be identified as a fifth-seventh century a.d. Byzantine gold- mining town. The main part consists of over 200 buildings, of which 55 were mapped in detail, ranging from one-room huts to multi-family houses of 16 or more rooms. Specialists' studies ofthe geology ofthe area, the pottery, and some first-second cen? tury a.d. graffiti in a nearby cave were undertaken as well. INTRODUCTION The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago carried out an archaeological sur? vey project in the Eastern Desert of Egypt at Bir Umm Fawakhir between January 11 and 23, 1992. The site lies half way between the Nile and the Red Sea coast, about 5 km northeast of the Wadi Hammamat, famous for its quarries and graffiti. Bir Umm Fawakhir is usually discussed along with the other ruins on the Quft (Coptos) to Quseir road, the most striking remains being a series of intervisible watch towers and fortified way stations (also called hydreumata) marking the Roman route. Depending on how one counts and dates the stations, Bir Umm Fawakhir is about the sixth in line after Matula, Laqeita (ancient Phoeni- con), Qasr Banat, Wadi Mweh, and Bir Hammamat (fig. 1). Although the Roman route has been sur- veyed and the hydreumata planned (see Meredith 1952, 1953; Redde and Golvin 1987; Zitterkopf and Sidebotham 1989), none of them has ever been excavated.1 The modern settlement at Bir Umm Fawakhir consists of a guard post, two tea houses, a few resi? dential houses, and a mosque still under construc? tion. The settlement lies in a fairly wide, flat, sandy area (ca. 7.5 km2) surrounded by jagged mountains dissected by numerous wadis. The western end of the open area is sharply defined by a ridge of moun- tains; the main road passes through a natural gap here (fig. 2). In the mountainside are a number of ancient gold mines, and at its foot are the wells, all-important in the desert. The mountains close in again as the road continues southeast towards Quseir and the Red Sea. The main group of ancient ruins is in a long, narrow wadi hidden from the road by a spur of hills (fig. 3). Other, smaller clusters of ruins are found closer to the modern settlement, near the main granite quarry, around an angle in a mountain as the road turns southeast, and in other places nearby that have been reported but not yet investigated. It is quite a remarkable experience to walk through the main settlement at Bir Umm Fawakhir. The ancient town consists of several hundred buildings strung out on either side of a sandy wadi bottom that served as the main street. The build? ings are all dry stone masonry but are well enough preserved that doors, niches, benches, trash heaps, and other features are readily visible. Steep granite cliffs enclose the settlement as though walled. The best views, in fact, are those from the tops of the cliffs; then the irregular, independent character of the house units becomes clearer. Our expectation was that a map would make the site still more comprehensible, and mapping and documentation of the surface remains were our major goals.

Left of center, one of the outlying settle? ments may be seen on the bottom of the broad wadi that also served as the ancient Roman road. Right of center, the narrow wadi enclosed by hills contains the main settle? ment of Bir Umm Fawakhir. The white patches to the far right are fine surface silts deposited by a re? cent flash flood. The modern road and tea houses are just out of sight to the right. Umm Fawakhir is an opportunity to study an entire ancient community without excavation. Urgency to study the site now stems from the fact that it is be? ing looted, and from the increased traffic on the Red Sea road, and hence from visitors who can too easily tumble the dry stone masonry. PREVIOUS ACCOUNTS OF BIR UMM FAWAKHIR No systematic archaeological survey or excava? tions had been carried out at Bir Umm Fawakhir prior to 1992, but the site is mentioned in a num? ber of travelers' accounts. Bir Umm Fawakhir was accessible only by camel caravan at the beginning of the 20th century, and even the construction of a paved road did not drastically increase traffic. The few vehicles that traveled the road primarily served mining operations and the quiet port of Quseir. At times the road was restricted by the army. Thus few visitors lingered at Bir Umm Fawakhir, none of them long enough to explore all the ruins and their outliers. That, as well as a cer? tain slippage in geographical names, occasionally makes it difficult to reconcile the old reports. Some of them do, however, preserve information about parts of the site now lost. Wilkinson knew the Wadee Foakheer for its masses of pottery, the settlement ruins, and a tem? ple, which he attributed to Ptolemy I. His estimate of the size of the settlement was very large, "reck- oning the different isolated portions of it, will have contained upwards of a thousand houses or huts of the miners" (Wilkinson 1835: 421-22). His slightly later travel guide notes the "huts of an? cient miners, breccia quarries, and hieroglyphic inscriptions on the rocks" (Wilkinson 1843: 50), apparently conflating the Wadi Hammamat and Bir Umm Fawakhir. One of the earliest visitors was Arthur E. P. Wei- gall, who followed many of the major camel routes and published a popular account in Travels in the Upper Egyptian Deserts (1909). He refers to the Bir Hammamat by name, but then names everything from there to Bir Umm Fawakhir as Wady Fowa- khieh, including the bekhen-stone quarries in the Wadi Hammamat and the ruins at Bir Umm Fawa? khir. Weigall refers to a long graffito of Vizier Amenemhet of the 11th Dynasty that mentions gold workers, and from it he seems to infer that the gold mines at Bir Umm Fawakhir go back to Pharaonic times (Weigall 1909: 41-43). By far his most valu? able contribution to the documentation of the site was his description of the Ptolemaic temple: In the reign of Ptolemy III, B.c 240, a little temple was built near the Bir Fowakhieh at the east end of the valley of the quarries. Wandering over this amphitheatre amidst the hills we came upon the remains of the little building, which had been con? structed of rough stones augmented by well-made basalt columns. It was dedicated to the god Min, the patron of the Eastern Desert; but as it was only about 12 feet by 22 in area the priests of the god could not have commanded the devotion of more than a few ofthe quarrymen (Weigall 1909: 49-50).</page><page sequence="44">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 41 He made the only known copy of the inscription in the temple (Weigall 1909: pl. 10). He also referred to groups of workmen's huts nearby, the gold mines, and the "very fine pink granite [that] began to be quarried just to the east of this well in Roman days" (Weigall 1909: 50). The book unfortunately has no maps, although the 1932 Qena-Quseir Road map published by the Survey of Egypt shows the temple directly south of the Roman tower, in effect flanking the western entrance to the Bir Umm Fawakhir area. Couyat called Bir Umm Fawakhir "une veritable ville" with a temple, quarries, and almost 10,000m3 of crushed quartz from mining. Most interesting, he reports a papyrus, now lost, and two statues found in the quarries. Battered, headless, and almost arm- less, the statues are nonetheless in a Classical style and were identified by Couyat as a nude Apollo and a semidraped Venus (Couyat 1910: 533-36). Reinach (1910: 130) noted the ruins of the tem? ple and the abundant sherds, and he repeated the estimate of 1000 houses. He remarked on the ab? sence of a military post, suggesting that it might have been buried by repeated well-cleaning. Mur? ray (1925: 146) added nothing to earlier accounts, noting only the existence of the Ptolemy III temple and gold mines, but no way-station. His photo? graph seems to show the outlying cluster of ruins between the mine adits and one of the granite quar? ries. Englebach (1931: 134) suggested taking the "basalt" columns from the Ptolemaic temple to the Egyptian Museum, but he mainly commented on the mines and quarries. Some of the early geological surveys made valuable observations on the Bedouin, flora, fauna, and antiquities as well as on the regional geology. Barron and Hume (1902: 49, 261) mentioned min? ers' huts, the temple, and granite quarries of Bir Umm Fawakhir, and they estimated the gold yield as 2 to 5 dwts (3 to 7.7 grams) per ton, not com- mercially viable. A later book briefly notes the "extensive ancient mines in which the quartz veins (up to ten inches in width) are most irregular in di? rection and size" (Hume 1937: 732). Most impor? tant of all, Hume reprinted Alford's 1900 sketch map of Fowakhir Gold Mine (Hume 1937: pl. 171), reproduced here as fig. 4. Rough as it is, the map seems to show the temple on the east side of the road, in the group of ruins closest to the mod? ern settlement. When Gueraud published the Bir Umm Fawa? khir ostraca, he gave some background information on the site, noting the abundance of sherds, the Fig. 4. From Hume 1937, reprint of Alford 1900. Ptolemy III temple, and the mines and their tail- ings, although it is not clear whether he ever vis? ited the site himself. For one thing, the well is not at the center of the settlement but at the far west? ern end. He also seemed to accept the estimate of a thousand or more huts (Gueraud 1942: 141-42). He did, however, describe a little of the renewed mining activity in 1940 and 1941 and the discov? ery of antiquities in the ancient debris, namely grinding stones, pottery vessels, lamps, beads, a few coins, and above all 60 or so ostraca (Gueraud 1942: 143). Unfortunately none of the artifacts have been published, though the ostraca are said to have come from both mine tailings and the group of houses closest to the mines (Gueraud 1942: 148). Palaeographically dated to the late first and second centuries a.d., seven ostraca are in Latin and all the rest in Greek. Almost all of them per- tain to military activity in the Eastern Desert, ei? ther at Bir Umm Fawakhir or elsewhere; none of the professions named were necessarily connected</page><page sequence="45">42 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 with mining (Gueraud 1942: 147). Almost all of the ostraca are letters concerned with provisions sent or desired; one badly damaged text may be a list of tools (Gueraud 1942: 196), though again none of them has to pertain to mining. There are several puzzling features about this corpus. If the ostraca were found in ancient mine tailings, then the mines must have been worked after the letters were discarded, perhaps even a very long time after. In other words, some of the mining activity must be late second century or later. Secondly, some of the ostraca are said to have come from the group of houses closest to the mines, but the near- est surviving cluster of houses is in fact associated with the same fifth to sixth century pottery as the buildings in the main wadi. Perhaps there was an? other group of huts closer still to the mines but de? stroyed by the 1940-1941 mining activity. There is simply no way to recheck the context of the os? traca. Finally, no military installation or hydreuma has been certainly identified at Bir Umm Fawakhir, although a line of cut stones near the modern mosque looks promising (see below). Debono's expedition through the Wadi Ham- mamat remarked in general on the huts near the gold mines and the abundant grinding stones. On the basis of potsherds (six illustrated), he dates the mining activity as far back as the Pharaonic era (Debono 1951: 80-81, pl. 14). No map is provided and no mention is made of the well or of Fawakhir, so it is unclear exactly which gold mine he means. Later in the article he notes "un grand cimetiere et d'autres plus petits, datant tous de l'epoque grecque ou romaine,... sur une hauteur dominant les vil- lages d'ouvriers des mines d'or. . . . Ils [the cemeter? ies] ont ete malheureusement devastes a fond par les voleurs" (Debono 1951: 82). None of the ceme? teries were found by the Bir Umm Fawakhir Project in 1992. Meredith's study of the Eastern Desert includes no new information specific to Bir Umm Fawakhir, although by his time the Ptolemaic temple had been destroyed (Meredith 1953: 98). In regard to the exploitation of the gold mines, however, he concluded that in general "in the central area both the Ptolemies and the Ancient Egyptians worked the gold mines, but not, apparently, the Romans" (Meredith 1953: 97). His concise and useful list of criteria for identifying ancient gold mining sites includes: (a) ancient workings (both open-cast on auriferous dykes and underground to considerable depths vouched for by modern engineers. . .); (b) abundant reciprocatory rubbing-stones everywhere (each pair consisting of a two-lugged upper stone, slightly convex with roughly parallel striations, rubbed against a rectangular, concave nether stone similarly striated); (c) upper and lower rotating hand-mills, like those of the fellahin today . . . ; (d) rubbing stones, usually the two-lugged upper stones, built into walls . . . : (3) the later use of rubbing stones as anvils or pounding stones (their old striations partly worn away and pock-marked with small pits); (g) banks of gold-crushing tail- ings . . . ; (i) underground water level (apparently, in places, visibly higher in ancient times than to? day). (Meredith 1953: 95). All the criteria are relevant to finds at Bir Umm Fawakhir, although none specify a date. A survey of the major routes and ruins in the Eastern Desert by Redde and Golvin has this to say about Bir Umm Fawakhir: Au kilometre 89, pres d'un poste de police mod- erne, apparaisserit d'assez nombreuse ruines, d'epoque ptolema'ique et romaine, soit un temple de Ptolemee III, et un ensemble de cabanes an- tiques . . . , probablement romaines, pres d'une se- rie de fronts de taille dans des carrieres de granit. Quatre kilometres plus loin sont connues d'anci- ennes mines d'or encore exploitees au debut de ce siecle. Dans les deblais d'une de ces exploitations a ete trouve un lot d'ostraca grecs et latins qui attestent la presence, en ces lieux, de militaires charges de surveiller l'exploitation des mines et des carrieres a la fois dans le defile et dans une se- rie de petits postes alentour. Le fortin n'a malheu- reusement pas ete retrouve (Redde and Golvin 1987: 9-10). The reference to a gold mine 4 km away is a little confusing. Are the authors referring to the gold mines at the modern mining camp (fig. 2), the clus- ter of ruins between them and Bir Umm Fawakhir, or some other mine outside the zone of the Bir Umm Fawakhir Project? If a gold mine other than that at Bir Umm Fawakhir is the source of Gueraud's ostraca, then some of the oddities about those ostraca might be explained. On the other hand, it is difficult to see why the Roman military would have by-passed the good water source at Bir Umm Fawakhir and the main Roman route, as marked by the intervisible towers. As for the state? ment that the soldiers were overseeing mining and quarrying, there is as yet no proof from the ostraca themselves that that is what they were doing. Zitterkopf and Sidebotham (1989: 177), in their detailed survey of the Coptos to Quseir route, note</page><page sequence="46">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 43 the lack of any fortification at Bir Umm Fawakhir but feel that the sizable population alone would have afforded protection. The large population is deduced quite reasonably from the hundreds of huts and outlying groups of buildings. The problem is that the buildings are associated with fifth-seventh century a.d. pottery (Zitterkopf and Sidebotham 1989: 166). The authors are the first to assign a Byz? antine date to the sherds, and we agree, but that still leaves no evidence of a Roman station, fortified or not, and certainly no larger a Roman population there than at any of the other hydreumata along the route. The extensive gold mining and granite quar- rying are noted, and Zitterkopf and Sidebotham state that most of the mining on the Coptos to Quseir route centered on gold (as opposed to, say, the important stone quarries at Mons Claudianus or Mons Porphyrites), primarily in the el-Fawakhir vi- cinity (Zitterkopf and Sidebotham 1989: 160, 177). This suggests that they accept a Roman date for the gold mining at Bir Umm Fawakhir. A final observation on the site comes from Henry Wright (personal communication), who did in fact find the possible remains of a Roman sta? tion. It now consists of a row of cut blocks barely visible at ground level near the modern mosque; everything else at the site is built of uncut stones. Wright reports Roman-period sherds, and the ones collected by the Bir Umm Fawakhir Project seem to confirm his observation (fig. 27). If the wall rep? resents part of the Roman way station, then it is not immediately adjacent to the modern wells nor directly on the ancient road, which took a northerly loop marked by watchtowers rather than the mod? ern southerly loop past Bir es-Sid. All the other way stations on the Quft-Quseir road have wells or storage tanks inside rather than 200-300 m away, and in fact the hydreumata could be described as fortified wells. The area of the possible Roman building is in direct line for some of the heaviest wadi wash from flash floods, not to mention mod? ern mining and road building activity; so it may well have been tumbled and obscured. It deserves to be investigated more closely. Clearly, the published accounts of the site are fragmentary and sometimes conflicting, and with? out good maps either of the region or of the site itself it is difficult to resolve the problems. Some parts of the site have been destroyed, such as the Ptolemaic temple, and others remain unpublished, such as the artifacts found at the same time as the ostraca. Perhaps most seriously, the main body of ruins was mistakenly called Roman for at least 150 years, until Zitterkopf and Sidebotham inspected the pottery and found it Byzantine. Part of the reason for the misidentification may be the long-held belief that the Byzantine presence in the desert was minimal or nonexistent. The Roman and pre-Roman periods back as far as Pre- dynastic times are far better documented and studied. Many works concerning Byzantine Egypt ignore the Eastern Desert altogether; and Alex- andria indeed dominated the cultural, economic, military, political, and religious scenes. One per? son who at least considered the Byzantine presence in the Eastern Desert was Maspero (1912: 10-11). He noted the wealth of minerals and the important ancient trade routes to India, but stated that the rather inconvenient port at Clysma was the only Red Sea port utilized under the Byzantine rulers (in fact, Berenice was also in use; see below). Lit- erary references to the Eastern Desert are almost totally lacking, barring one seventh-century source that adds no information to the Roman writers. Maspero suggested that when the Blemmyes were defeated2 they fled to the Eastern Desert and finished off whatever was left of the old routes and stations. He concluded, "et ainsi, peu a peu, sans qu'on puisse fixer une date precise, la domination romano-byzantine cessa d'etre effective dans ces paysages: ce qui explique le silence total qui les enveloppe a notre epoque" (Maspero 1912: 11). Johnson and West do not directly deal with the Eastern Desert at all. They do mention the ports at Clysma (Suez), Aela, Ocelis near the Bab el- Mandeb, and Adulis, the chief port for the king? dom of Axum (Johnson and West 1949: 137). More specific data can be gleaned from the list of ships seized by the king of Axum in a.d. 524/525 for war: 20 from Clysma, 15 from Aela, 9 from India, 7 each from Berenice and Farsan Island, and two from Jotabe (Johnson and West 1949: 138), a mention, at least, of Berenice. The authors noted in passing that "the caravan route from Myos Hormos to Antinoopolis [well north of the Wadi Ham? mamat route] was important enough for the ala- barch [a customs official] to maintain an office in the latter city in the sixth century" (Johnson and West 1949: 106), but they felt that after Justinian the eastern trade via the Red Sea and Indian Ocean dwindled in favor of overland routes to Persia (Johnson and West 1949: 138). Certainly Constantinople knew of Axum, a ma? jor kingdom centered in the north Ethiopian high? lands with a Red Sea port at Adulis (near Massawa in Eritrea). Diplomatic exchanges occurred in the</page><page sequence="47">44 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 time of Constantius II, and Justinian in particular tried to strengthen trade relations (Munro-Hay 1991: 8, 57). Above all we have the sixth century work of Cosmas Indicopleustes, whose section on the Axumite port at Adulis includes a description of a monumental throne with a long Greek inscrip? tion dedicated by a Ptolemaic ruler. Cosmas also mentioned merchants from Alexandria and Aila (Aqaba) at Adulis (11.54) as well as the Axumite silent gold trade with the Sasu (11.51). In light of new evidence from sites such as 3Abu ShaDar (Sidebotham et al. 1989), Wadi Nakheil (Prickett 1979: 297-303), and Bir Umm Fawakhir, and what can be gleaned from old accounts concern- ing Berenice (Floyer 1893; Meredith 1957; Side? botham 1986: 53), the idea of Byzantine neglect of the Eastern Desert needs to be re-examined. GEOLOGY OF THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR AREA We place the geologist's report at the beginning of the section on the work accomplished by the 1992 Bir Umm Fawakhir survey because the geol? ogy explains a great deal about the site's layout and about its reasons for existence. The only resources are mineral. A series of faults and contact zones meet at the western end of the Bir Umm Fawakhir area, explaining both its high western ridge of mountains and the gap that permits the road to pass through. The Fawakhir granite to the east is the aquifer, the water being carried in fine cracks in the rock until it meets the dense ultramafic rocks at the western end of the area, and the wells are in fact dug near the contact zone. The pinkish granite was quarried at one time, probably the Roman period. The extensively worked gold mines follow the quartz veins in the Fawakhir granite. The main group of ruins lies in a narrow wadi whose steep sides serve as a boundary and almost as a town wall; the east end is defined by a high dyke of tough felsite rock with a natural gate in it. A BRIEF GEOLOGICAL REPORT ABOUT THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR AREA BY MOHAMED B. E. OMAR MOSTAFA Introduction The Eastern Desert extends from the Nile Valley east to the Red Sea, and consists essentially of a backbone of high, rugged mountains running paral? lel to the coast. These mountains of the Precambrian Basement Complex are flanked to the north, east, and west by intensively dissected sedimentary pla- teaux. The Precambrian Basement Complex forms part of the western segment of the extensive Late Proterozoic Arabian-Nubian Shield. Recent studies show that the evolution of the complex is better interpreted in terms of plate tectonic models. A complex of ensimatic terranes are considered to have evolved through the process of volcanic are accretion, ophiolite obduction and granitoid mag? matic crustal thickening between ca. 950-580 Ma. The Precambrian Basement Complex of the East? ern Desert consists of sequences of volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks that have been metamor- phosed to lower greenschist facies and intruded by a variety of granitic and basic rocks. Structurally, it is generally accepted to subdivide the Eastern Desert into three major segments: northern, central, and southern. Each segment is characterized by differ? ences in gross lithological constitution and differ- ently enhanced structural styles. Egypt has a long history of gold mining dating back to Pharaonic times. The Romans and later peoples produced gold. Weather-worn waste piles and ruins at old mines vary in character, suggest- ing multiple periods of operation. There are more than 95 known gold deposits and occurrences in Egypt, mainly associated with the Precambrian Basement Complex of the Eastern Desert; and the last mine (Fawakhir) closed in 1958. An estimated 1,710 tons of gold has been produced from allu- vial/colluvial and hard rock deposits. Hard-rock mining was concentrated on the oxidized portions of gold-quartz veins, where simply mining tech? niques could be employed and gold could be won by unsophisticated hand-milling and leaching. Evi? dence of firesetting is seen, and many sites are marked by discarded grinding stones and hand- held stone hammers. The region was prospected in detail by the ancients, and abandoned workings such as small trenches, shafts, and quarries are common sights in the desert. Any site explored to? day will almost certainly contain ancient workings. Local Geology The investigated area predominantly comprises an elongate stock of heterogeneous hybrid grani- toids referred to as "Fawakhir granite," emplaced into serpentinite rocks.

Structure and Lithology Fawakhir Granite. The Fawakhir granite is for the most part a coarse to very coarse crystalline rock, mottled gray to pink in color, comprising crystals of quartz clusters, feldspar (plagioclase), variably distributed pink feldspar (orthoclase), and tiny spots of black biotite and stained-opaque min? eral hematite. In many localities the pink feldspar crystals are large, up to 1.5 cm long, giving the rock a porphyritic character. In addition, there are still younger dykes of pink felsite, pegmatite (re- spectively fine-grained and coarse-grained acidic rocks), and numerous quartz stringers and veins in- vading the granite. Fawakhir granite is variably heterogeneous and consists of a wide range of composition between gray granodiorite to pink alkali feldspar granite with mafic xenoliths derived from the pre-existing rocks. It is jointed (fig. 20) and exfoliated (fig. 21), resulting in the normal rectangular pattern and in spheroidal masses of granite respectively. In addi? tion, this causes a breakdown of feldspar crystals into kaolin in some places. There are three main sets of joints as shown in Table 1. As a result, Fawakhir granite is easily cut for blocks. North-northeast of Bir Umm Fawakhir are some remains of mining activities by the ancient prospect- ing for the noble metal and its extraction from surface pits, trenches, and shafts and primitive un- derground mines. Gold occurs in veins made up of</page><page sequence="49">46 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 massive, milky quartz with disseminated gold and sulphide minerals (galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyr- rhotite, and sphalerite). The mineralized veins are structurally controlled, being fissure fillings or con- fined to zones of intensive fracturing that have ap? proximately east-west trends, moderately dipping to the south. The veins may be arranged as a series of en echelon veins (up to 1 to 2 m width) with pinches and swells and parallel veinlets and stringers of con- siderable thickness as well. Serpentinite Rocks. The serpentinite rocks oc- cupy the western part of the investigated area. The color ranges from grayish green, green, to black, or earthy (khaki) for the altered rocks. The serpen? tinite rocks may be medium to coarse grained, lo? cally banded, massive, with dull, waxy texture and a smooth to a splintery fracture. They are criss- crossed by veins of fibrous chrysotile serpentine, joint fillings of magnesium carbonate, and grani- toid offshoots as well (Hussein 1990). These rocks are intensively altered and sheared in places, and are associated with well-developed actinolite-trem- olite, chlorite, talc schist, relict olivine, and rare basaltic pods. Gabbroid Sheets. The gabbroid sheets are dark gray, medium to coarse grained, melanocratic, composed mainly of hornblende amphibole, a few interstitial feldspars (ophitic, subophitic texture), and relicts of olivine and pyroxene. Volcaniclastic Sediments and Intermediate to Basic Lava Association. These are reworked py- roclastics and volcaniclastic deposits, mainly vol? caniclastic breccia conglomerate associated with intermediate to basic volcanic lava. These volca- nics are both pillowed and non-pillowed and are predominantly aphyric in texture. Vesicles and amygdaloidal structures developed in these lavas; the cavities are filled with an aphanitic cement. PHARAONIC, PTOLEMAIC, AND ROMAN REMAINS Actual Pharaonic remains at Bir Umm Fawa? khir are so far limited to Debono's six sherds (De- bono 1951: pl. 14). The most remarkable piece of evidence, however, for the ancient Egyptians' knowledge of the Bir Umm Fawakhir area is the Turin Papyrus. One plausible reading takes it as a map of the bekhen-stone quarries in the Wadi Table 1. Joint Alignments at Bir Umm Fawakhir Trend Dipping Toward Range of Angle Northeast-southwest Southeast 40-65 Northeast 40-65 90= Northeast-southeast Northeast 50-70 90= Subhorizontal Joints Hammamat and the gold mines a little farther east at Bir Umm Fawakhir. The papyrus was found at Deir el-Medina, across the Nile from Luxor (an? cient Thebes) and may be attributed to one of the bekhen-stone quarrying expeditions carried out during the reign of Ramses IV of the 20th Dynasty. The Turin Papyrus shows mountains labeled as gold mines, a small miners' camp, a well, a size- able Amun temple, and two roads to the sea run- ning off the map (Harrell and Brown 1992).3 Evidence for a Ptolemaic presence is limited to the now-lost Ptolemy III Euergetes temple, though most of the early travelers discussed above made observations on it, most notably Weigall (1909: 49-50). Ptolemy III, however, is known to have promoted energetically the trade with Africa, specifically for war elephants, and this entailed es- tablishing ports along the Red Sea coast and routes through the desert. The Roman system of hydreu? mata and watch towers probably followed the Ptolemaic route, and it has even been suggested that the latter were built then (Zitterkopf and Side? botham 1989: 180). The Roman remains are far more sparse than when the whole complex of house ruins in the main wadi and the outliers was attributed to them. Still, we definitely have the watch tower over the western gap leading into Bir Umm Fawakhir, some sherds, a few bits of faience, the graffiti in the cave (see next section), the quarries, and perhaps one wall remnant of a large building or way station. The granite quarries are tentatively taken to be Ro? man in date because the Romans are the ones who most avidly sought out the granites, porphyries, breccia verde antique, and other handsome Eastern Desert stones. The ancient Egyptians seem to have relied mainly on the more accessible Aswan gran? ites, and apart from Mons Porphyrites the Byzan? tine rulers do not seem to have worked the stone quarries as zealously as their predecessors. Also,</page><page sequence="50">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 47 the quarrying techniques and chisel marks appear to match those observed at Mons Claudianus, an important granite quarry exploited mainly in the first and second centuries. It has long been pre- sumed that Bir Umm Fawakhir was one of the se? ries of hydreumata on the Quft to Quseir road, and the absence of the expected fortified way station was consistently noted. The area around the mod? ern wells has been thoroughly clawed up by mod? ern mining activity, but none of the 19th century travelers noted any ruins there. Still, it seems un- likely that the Romans ignored a good water source in the desert, and the fact that their road did pass this way is proven by the string of intervisible towers. The remnant of a wall made of cut stones near the new mosque needs to be investigated as a possible Roman building. THE GRAFFITI BY TERENCE WILFONG Inscriptional material from the 1992 Bir Umm Fawakhir Survey was limited to a number of graffiti found in a cave west of the Byzantine set? tlement, across the modern road (fig. 6). Prelimi? nary records of these graffiti were made on the morning of January 19. The cave, apparently a natural, shallow one, is located in a fairly sheer cliff face and was the site of occasional mining at- tempts. There was no sign of recent human activity in the cave, although there was considerable evi? dence that it was frequently used by animals. The back wall of the cave bears many gouges made by chisels, including a sort of sunburst design that ap? parently was cut preparatory to carving out a hole. There are three manmade holes in the floor, appar? ently quite old. A few small potsherds were found in the cave, ribbed pottery of the sort found in the settlement site. The main interest of the cave is the graffiti it contains: 11 separate inscriptions. All of the graffiti were either written in a reddish-brown paint or carved (fig. 7). The painted graffiti have suffered from the elements and are generally faint. Two are painted pictorial representations of a boat (fig. 7:3) and an animal (fig. 7:6). The boat graffito is a drawing of a boat with a square sail, several oars, and apparently a steering rudder of some sort; the drawing is done in reddish-brown paint with a heavy brush; it is damaged and very faint.4 The animal graffito, showing the upper part of a lion(?), is done with a fine brush in a practiced hand. Fig- Fig. 6. Cave with graffiti. ure 7:5 is a single marking in reddish paint, which may be a quarry-mark of some sort. Three of the graffiti are apparently texts, but they are so faint and damaged as to make the script unidentifiable at present. Figure 7:1 is a series of very faint scratches into the rock face; the light in the cave made it impossible to copy accurately or identify it. Figure 7:7 is also very faint and uncertain; it ap? pears to be in the same paint and brush-type as the lion drawing (fig. 7:6), which is immediately be? low. It is likely that fig. 7:7 may even be a part of the drawing. Figure 7:10 is a series of extremely faint marks in red paint that may not even be an inscription. Of the identifiable scripts, fig. 7:9, a seven-line painted inscription in Epigraphic South Arabian, is of great interest. The text is highly damaged, but it has been very tentatively dated to the first or second century a.d.5 The remaining four graffiti, all in Greek, are completely legible. Two are of the common "good luck" type (eutuche or some variant thereof), writ? ten in reddish paint by Sales (fig. 7:8) and Dorkon (fig. 7:4). The name "Dorkon" makes up another of</page><page sequence="51">48 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 * x ?&gt;OPK@ Sketchmapof cave showing inscriptions 1-11 ?man made hole * chisel marks 1?0"y ?&gt;&lt;,V GYTxoocr CAAHcr 8 11 Fig. 7.

Dorkon was a common name in Roman Egypt; other graffiti by men of the same name are known from else- where in the Eastern Desert. The remaining graffito (fig. 7:11) is the most elaborate: a carved four-line inscription enclosed in a tabula ansata design. The first line is written cryptographically, the rest in the</page><page sequence="52">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 49 iPiSw^^i^!^ ^-??^a 7'y^M^^^M Fig. 8. View of felsite dyke at the southeast end of the main settle? ment. Clusters of houses may be seen to the left, and the empty wadi bottom to the right. normal script. It is the inscription of a man named Longinus, who gives thanks "to all the gods in this place." Figures 7:4 and 7:11 have been previously published (Letronne 1848),6 although both were in- correctly copied and the cryptogram in 11 com? pletely misunderstood. Unfortunately, none of the Greek graffiti contain dates, and none have distinctive enough forms to be dated epigraphically. The names?Dorkon, Sales, and Longinus?are all common and all at? tested for the first three centuries a.d. The mention of "all the gods" in fig. 7:11 makes it likely that the text dates to before the "Christianization" of Upper Egypt in the third and fourth centuries but does not permit a more definite date. It is clear that the Greek graffiti (and the South Arabian text as well) predate the Byzantine settlement by at least a few centuries, and that they are probably roughly contemporary with the 60-plus Greek and Latin os? traca found in the vicinity of Fawakhir at the turn of the century. THE BYZANTINE SETTLEMENT The goals of the Bir Umm Fawakhir Survey were to map the main group of ruins and to take a sample of surface pottery, thus preserving at least some record of the site. With 12 working days only, we mapped 55 buildings and some of the to- pography, copied the graffiti, and took seven sherd collections. Mapping began at the southeast end of the main wadi because a natural "gate" in a high felsite dyke there defines the eastern limit of the site (fig. 8), and because the houses are better pre? served (if looted) and easier to understand than the more ruined buildings closer to the modern road. The orientation off of magnetic north comes about because we followed the natural alignment of the settlement, strung out along its main street, the wadi bottom. In all, approximately one quarter of the buildings in the main wadi were plotted. Two datum points were established on large granite boulders in the wadi bed and marked with rectangles in black enamel. Datum 101 is close to Building 54 and Datum 102 is near Building 5. A third datum point was shot in and marked on the granite knob overlooking Building 45. No artificial grid was imposed on the site because the buildings are still visible and could be treated as units in their own right. We were fortunate in borrowing the Oriental Institute's Lietz Set 3 Total Instrument Station (TIS), which greatly facilitated the work. The TIS bounces an infrared beam off a prism held over the point being shot and reads slope distance, horizontal distance, elevation, and much other in? formation. It also gives north and east coordinates automatically, which permitted us to plot all points each evening. The survey procedure first called for Heidorn, Meyer, or Wilfong to sketch a building or group of buildings in a field notebook. In the accompanying field notes, comments could be written on features such as benches, niche measurements, bonding, looters' holes, grinding stones, small finds if any, ash, bones, and anything else of interest. One per- son acted as instrumentman to shoot the points se- lected by the sketcher. All points were numbered</page><page sequence="53">50 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 Bir Umm Fawakhir Project 1992 Oriental lnsuiute of the University of Chicago B = Bench BD = Blocked Door CS/L = Crushing Stone.

A "B" prefaced a building point, a "T" a topography shot. The third person sketched the next buildings. As an added benefit, the sketches could be photocopied each evening for the photographer, who could tape the copies in his notebook and mark film roll numbers, shot num? ber, and general direction on each sketch and thus eliminate possible confusion. All buildings shot on a given day were plotted the same evening on graph paper at a scale of 1:200, the sketches being used as guides for connecting the plotted dots. The buildings were numbered 1 to 55 starting at the "East Gate," down a south side wadi, up a north side wadi, and then down the wadi bed toward the west. All contiguous rooms in a unit received one number, as Building 1 (a one-room outbuilding) or Building 50 (a 19-room agglomeration). No at? tempt was made to distinguish houses and out- buildings initially, and indeed the pattern was not</page><page sequence="54">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 51 Fig. 9b.

No attempt was made to letter or number rooms or features within a building, because we thought that prema- ture; but if any house be more intensively studied or excavated, more detailed labels could easily be added then. The map produced (fig. 9) is one of the most im? portant results of the project. The wadi bottom plus</page><page sequence="55">52 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 Fig. 9c. Map of Bir Umm Fawakhir.</page><page sequence="56">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 53 some small side branches are the main streets of the site, quite broad in places and narrow in others. Rain is so rare that drainage was probably not a ma? jor problem for the ancient inhabitants, but floods since then have damaged parts of several build? ings, notably Buildings 12, 3, 5, 41, 47, 45, and 54. A high felsite dyke runs behind Buildings 21, 15, 2, 1, and 11, and a natural gate between Buildings 1 and 2 marks the southeast end of the site. Clearly there was no attempt at a Classical town plan laid out on a grid system. The houses, too, are irregular. They have a pat? tern but nothing like the nearly contemporary houses of Jeme (Medinet Habu). Houses typically consist of two or three rooms with one entrance from the street (Buildings 4, 7, 11, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 53, and 54). Two or more of the two- or three-room houses may be ag- glomerated into a larger unit (Buildings 3, 5, 6, 12, 17, 27, 37, 41, 51, and above all 50). The remains of Buildings 21, 28, and 46 are badly tumbled. The plans of Buildings 48 and 49 and not yet clear; they seem to have been partly reworked. Scattered on the slopes behind the houses or in the empty spaces between them are a number of one-room outbuildings, either rounded or subrectangular in plan (Buildings 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33?, 35, 36, 40, 52, and 55). Some are quite small, irregular constructions like Building 26, but some are fairly large like Building 18. Building 10 has two carefully made wall niches. Building 13 has a bench, and perhaps Buildings 31 and 35 as well; benches and niches are generally associated with houses. We cannot yet ascertain the function of the outbuildings? storage, animal shelter, workshops, or latrines. In addition there are some low walls, usually only one stone high, in places where sliding rocks or sand wash were likely to be problems. We have la? beled them as "retaining walls." Finally, there are a few rectangular, stone-built features that might have been benches or hearths; one lies between Buildings 1 and 3, one between Buildings 14 and 16, and another between Buildings 27 and 28. Thus, although we mapped 55 buildings, only 16 to 21 are houses, 10 or 11 are large, agglomer- ated houses, and the remaining 22 or 23 are out? buildings. The separateness of the houses and the lack of crowding are also noteworthy. When popu? lation estimates are made for the ancient commu- nity, this will have to be taken into account. All of the buildings appear to have been built of dry stone masonry. There is virtually no evidence of mortar or plastering, although if excavation be undertaken and now buried portions of walls be uncovered, the picture could change abruptly. Al? though the building stones are carefully selected and laid with skill, we have as yet found no cut masonry. Most of the building stones are granite cobbles or felsite chunks, and the granite is now badly weathered and crumbly. One question is whether the stone was already weathered when the builders selected it, or whether the decay has oc? curred since then. The walls are typically built with neat inner and outer faces, the space between being filled with smaller stones, often felsite, and sometimes potsherds. All of the sherds observed in situ in wall fill were body sherds, but they do deserve closer attention because they are clearly older than the wall construction. The walls are sufficiently rough that it is difficult to get an exact measurement of their widths, but they are gener? ally about 0.5 m wide. Especially thick walls or double walls, however, were noted and drawn in. Wherever possible we recorded nonbonded walls and blocked doors, although neither feature is common. Building 50 seems to have added on at least six one-room units, but apart from that there is not as much evidence of adding on and expand- ing as one might find in long-inhabited homes. Herein lies one reason for suggesting that the com- munity was fairly short-lived. Enclosed courtyards or work areas are common features of most Middle Eastern architecture, but as yet few "rooms" can be identified as possible courtyards at Bir Umm Fawakhir. The only clues come from the circulation pattern, areas too large to be roofed easily, or perhaps from wider than usual doorways. The houses typically are provided with wall niches for storage, though the number of niches varies widely. The large, well-preserved Building 27 has only one, and sprawling Building 50 has only two preserved, whereas the much more mod- est Buildings 11 and 42 have at least eight niches each. Niches show no pattern of arrangement and need not even be on the same level in the same wall (fig. 24, Building 42). Sometimes only half a niche is preserved, and in badly ruined walls the niches may of course be totally lost. Benches are another characteristic built-in fea? ture. They are generally made of a row of slabs set upright and apparently filled with sand and small stones. The benches are either backed up against a wall or built into a corner. A large, smooth boulder was used as a bench in Building 38, and several</page><page sequence="57">54 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 buildings have outside benches as well. Looters have consistently clawed into the interior benches, and sometimes the shape of a looter's hole is the only indication that a bench once existed there (note Building 17). The features are called "benches" be? cause they are characteristic features of Egyptian houses of all ages, from Deir al-Medina to Mons Claudianus and the Esna hermitages, up to the present day. They could, of course, have served other functions as well, such as holding water jars, but until it is demonstrated otherwise we are using the provisional label of "bench." Hearths are so far surprisingly uncommon, even though it gets cold in the desert in the winter. Build? ing 27 has a stone-rimmed corner in one room with some ash, and circles of stones in Buildings 12 and 17 might have been other hearths. Some of the smaller benches also might have served as hearths, but without any ash that is difficult to prove. Apart from dung, fuel was probably scarce in the desert, and winds have blown away most of the surface ash; nonetheless, hearths are a domestic feature that may be expected should excavation be initiated. Building 14 has a stone-lined basin or trough of unknown function; the west wall of the house is so destroyed that it cannot be determined whether the area was enclosed or only partly enclosed. The grinding stones and mortars found in the houses may or may not pertain to domestic use; they gen? erally are considered to be ore crushing stones re- used as building material. In any case, only one crushing stone so far as been found in situ, a threshold block in Building 17. One outstanding feature of the site is the trash heaps immediately adjacent to each house or group of houses or else dumped up on the slopes behind them. The trash heaps provide an opportunity to investigate deposition patterns of a specific house or group of houses without much, if any, of the re? working, pitting, clearance, or redeposition usual on long-lived sites. Sherds or other artifacts can with some security be attributed to the closest house or houses, although more caution must be exercised with surface material. We have no floors or remains of door panels or roofing material yet, and only two or three doubt- ful windows. Judging from a few intact thresholds and the looters' holes, floors in this part of the site lie 30-50 cm or less below the surface of the sand that has drifted in. If excavation be undertaken, floor levels should be reached quickly. Doors, at least those opening onto the streets, presumably would have been made of wood; at least one stone door socket is still visible. Door jambs generally are constructed of fairly large, carefully laid stones, often long, thin ones (fig. 18, Building 27). Walls might have been plastered, though water is a prime commodity in the desert and we have as yet very little evidence of plastering. The walls were probably well chinked, however, as the desert win- ter wind is penetrating and cold. All of the niches have been labeled "niches" even when the thin back walls have fallen away so that the features now look like windows. Generally there is enough rough rubble behind a damaged niche to show that no finished sill ran through the wall. The modern houses at Bir Umm Fawakhir tend to have small, shuttered or shaded windows, often high in the wall. The two most problematic cases are the win- dow/door in Building 27 (see below) and the two westernmost niches in Building 11; they do go through the wall and do seem more finished than the usual broken niches. Of roofs, we have not a scrap. The rooms presumably were spanned by palm logs, stringers, and some sort of roofing ma? terial. It had to be solid enough to stand the hamsin winds, but not necessarily waterproof. Even today in the Valley, people mostly just get miserable and wet when a rare heavy rain falls and drips through the ceiling. Wood for doors, roofs, and anything else is valuable in the desert and was probably one of the first things stripped away. Overall, the houses are quite idiosyncratic and certainly had some leeway for expansion. Building 41 grew in a particularly ungainly fashion. The houses seem reasonably spacious and fitted out with comforts such as niches for storage and benches for resting or sleeping. There is, at this point, no sign of central planning or regimented, military orderliness, much less of cramped, mean, slave quarters. Administration there must have been, but so far it cannot be seen to have affected residents' house plans in any obvious fashion. What we do not have at Bir Umm Fawakhir is almost as interesting as what we do have. First and foremost there are no defenses, even though secu- rity was always a concern in the desert. A gold miners' camp would be rather tempting to raiders, as would a caravan marching to or from the Red Sea ports with trade goods. If the site were a mili? tary post, then one would by definition expect for? tifications. The Byzantine fort at DAbu Shacar, also long identified as Roman, does in fact have a de? fensive wall, towers, fortified gate, regular streets, barracks, and a central building (probably a prin- cipia or a church; Sidebotham et al. 1989: 130,</page><page sequence="58">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 55 143). Even most of the monasteries of the period had some defenses. It was suggested that Buildings 1 and 2 might have been guard posts at Bir Umm Fawakhir's southeast "gate," but there is as yet nothing to distinguish them from any of the other outbuildings. The steep ridges overlooking the set? tlement have numerous pot drops and sherds, but so far no guard posts, much less fortifications. The old Roman tower overlooking the road to Bir Umm Fawakhir might have served Byzantine sentries as well, but again there is no evidence for much use?no accumulation of potsherds for instance. It is conceivable that there were some defenses or guard posts at the northwest entrance to the main settlement, or perhaps some out on the broad open area toward the wells, but nothing has been found there yet. Should work be resumed at Bir Umm Fawakhir, the problem of defenses would be ex? plored further. None of the buildings mapped so far looks like a warehouse, although there must have been some facility for storing food and supplies. Almost every- thing had to be hauled from the Nile Valley, and hence there must have been some central point for loading and unloading, distributing, and storing goods, even if only temporarily. What a Byzantine administrative building in the desert may have looked like we do not know, but there must have been some administration for a set? tlement of this size. If Bir Umm Fawakhir was in fact a gold mining camp, it is difficult to believe that the Byzantine government could have kept its hand out of a pot so potentially lucrative. Until modern times, all expeditions to or settlements in the East? ern Desert were wholly or partially supported by the current regime, whether the ruler was pharaoh, em- peror, or sultan. We will return to this question later, but given the Byzantine government's direc? tion (or misdirection) of its citizens' taxes and lives, it may be assumed that some representative kept track of activities at Bir Umm Fawakhir. At the very least, we would expect ostraca. That some of the inhabitants of Bir Umm Fawa? khir were Christians is indicated by bowls with stamped crosses (fig. 10), but there is no church. It has been suggested that the Ptolemaic temple might have been converted, but the temple is long destroyed and none of the 19th century travelers mentioned any sign of Christian reuse. Animal lines or shelters are not in evidence, al? though animals must have carried supplies to the people of Bir Umm Fawakhir. The Roman hydreu? mata on the Wadi Hammamat route do not, it is Fig. 10.

Camels, which do not need much shelter, probably bore most of the traffic, but a few donkeys, sheep, or goats might have been tended, as they are by the present-day Bedouin. Given a hike of a kilometer from Building 3 to the modern wells, a donkey or so to carry water would have been desirable. Some of the outbuildings, or perhaps the irregular, open(?) space in Building 41, might have sheltered animals, but it remains to be demonstrated. A study of the bones from the trash heaps next to the houses might answer some of the questions about animals. If baked bread were brought from the Valley,7 it would have reached the hardtack stage by the time it got to the settlers, but it could have been done. Fuel for baking or heating would always have been at a premium, but as mentioned hearths are uncom- mon and ovens are totally undocumented so far. Mining tools also had to come from the Valley, but there must have been an on-site smithy to re- sharpen and mend them. Such a facility, however,</page><page sequence="59">56 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 Fig. 11. Rotary grinding stone and three anvil stones. would most logically have been located near the mines, a part of the site much disrupted by modern activity. Finally, we expect cemeteries. Debono's (1951) mention of thoroughly looted graves on the ridges overlooking the settlement is the only hint so far as to where they might have been. The 1992 project encountered no graves, but the work was concen- trated on the town proper. One would expect no grave goods at all for Christians, but at places like Jeme (Medinet Habu) there seems to have been some variability in burial practices. ARTIFACTS By far the most abundant surface finds at Bir Umm Fawakhir are potsherds, which Heidorn dis- cusses (below). There is also some splintery bone on some of the trash heaps or in the spoil from looters' holes. Other finds are meager, mainly crushing or pounding stones, three glass sherds, a sandstone trough, a ceramic lamp fragment, and one mud brick. The crushing stones are made of granite, one piece being a handsome porphyry. One type of crushing stone consists of a heavy, lower stone and a smaller upper handstone for rubbing back and forth. Most of the examples are the heavy, concave lower part (see fig. 18, Building 27); the upper handstones have not been found so far. The other type of crushing stones is a rotary mill; both upper and lower stones have been recorded on site (fig. 11). Unfortunately, neither the dating of the crush? ing stones, whether Ptolemaic, Roman, or Byzan? tine, nor the gold extraction techniques used in the Byzantine period have received much attention. The oldest relevant source is Diodorus Siculus who, following Agatharchides' second century b.c. account, describes the extreme misery of the Egyp? tian gold miners. To extract the gold from the ore, workers take this quarried stone . . . and with iron pestles pound a specified amount of it in stone mortars, until they have worked it down to the size of a vetch. Thereupon the women and older men re- ceive from them the rock of this size and east it into mills of which a number stand there in a row, and taking their places in groups of two or three at the spoke or handle of each mill they grind it until they have worked down the amount given them to the consistency of the finest flour (Diodorus of Sicily 111.13). The rotary mills found at Bir Umm Fawakhir fit this picture, but the mortars do not; the one from Building 42 is a limestone too soft for crushing quartz. No trace of iron tools has yet been detected. Lucas (1962: 228) basically followed Diodorus' description. Recently Klemm and Klemm (1991) restudied the question of gold ore milling tech? niques. According to their description, the raw ore was first crushed on rather small anvil stones (ca. 30 x 30 cm) by means of rounded stone hammers weighing about a 0.5 to 1.0 kilo. In the Ptolemaic period, large concave grinding stones with a heavy, crescent-shaped upper stone were used to pulverize</page><page sequence="60">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 57 the ore, versus the flat stones used by the ancient Egyptians. The rotary mill or quern was a Roman innovation, though surprisingly enough the Roman anvil stones were smaller, ca. 15 x 15 cm (Klemm and Klemm 1991). The quartz pounders from Bir Umm Fawakhir come close to this description of the hammer stones. Are the concave crushing stones Ptolemaic and the rotary mills Roman or later? Or were the concave stones used in the first stage of ore reduc- tion and the rotary mills for the fine grinding? Closer inspection of the wear marks on the con? cave stones might answer this question, but further research on Byzantine gold extraction techniques is needed as well. The finds are also noted with their buildings, but are listed together here. All items were left in place on site. Building 7. A rectangular, concave lower crush? ing stone. Building 14. Two round, bashed pounders made of quartz. Diameters 6.3 and at least 9 cm respectively. Glass lamp stem (fig. 12b). The fragment is of bubbly, olive-colored glass without weathering or pontil scar. Stemmed glass lamps shaped some- thing like a flaring champagne glass with no foot were common in Byzantine times (Meyer 1989: 240). Such lamps rested in holders, usually large metal disks with circles cut out to hold the lamps. The whole could be suspended by chains. Dump behind Buildings 12, 13, 14. A subrectangu- lar granite grinding stone, measuring ca. 27 x 17 x 9 cm. One cobalt blue glass sherd, thin, no weathering. One glass jar or beaker neck, light olive, bubbly, no weathering. Building 17. One rectangular, concave lower crushing stone. One rotary crushing stone made of porphyry, broken in half and reused as a threshold. (Outside Building 17) One rectangular, concave lower crushing stone. Building 27. Two rectangular, concave lower crushing stones. One sandstone trough fragment, 27 cm wide x 12 cm high x 19 cm long before break. The inte? rior is pecked. Sandstone is not native to Bir Umm Fawakhir, although the Nubian sandstones begin not far west of Bir Hammamat. Building 37. One rounded quartz pounding stone. Building 39. Fragment of a grinding stone. Building 40. Ceramic lamp fragment (fig. 12a), buff ware, now crumbly. The design is faint. 5cm Fig. 12. Fragment of ceramic lamp (a) and glass lamp (b). Building 42. Fragment of a mortar made of lime? stone. One mud brick. Building 43. (Outside) Rectangular, concave lower crushing stone. Building 51. Fragment of a mortar. Again, what we do not have is interesting. There are yet no textile fragments, no metal, and no wood fragments, although the latter two materials proba? bly were scavenged almost immediately after aban- donment of a building or the site. THE SHERD SAMPLE Potsherds are easily the most abundant find at the site, so much so that the project could easily have spent the entire field season on them alone. Given that they are all surface finds and subject to displacement and that priority was given to map- ping the settlement, we had to find some means of controlling the sheer numbers of sherds to be pro- cessed. The requirement that all sherds be tallied, drawn, and left on site at the collection point fur? ther restricted the number that we could handle. We therefore took samples from three areas of particular interest and then a sample of one in ten of the different structures and features in the main set? tlement. We were particularly interested in: the wall remnant near the modern mosque as being the pos? sible locus of a Roman structure; the mine tailings</page><page sequence="61">58 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 across the road as possibly clarifying Gueraud's statements about the ostraca; and the area of the wells, probably the most continuously utilized part of the site. The technique was to find some point that could be identified again on these littered and reworked surfaces and to lay out a circle with refer? ence to that point. A nail was sunk into the ground and a circle with a 1 m radius described (the "dog- leash" technique); all sherds within the circle were collected during a five-minute period. This at least ensured that the areas sampled were comparable in size. In the main settlement it soon became clear that there were three predominant kinds of features: houses or agglomerated houses, one-room out- buildings, and trash heaps. Eliminating all those disturbed by looting, we randomly selected one in ten of the remaining features. For houses we could not use this selection procedure because only one, Building 27, was relatively undisturbed. Here, sherds were so sparse that we collected from all rooms not contaminated by the dump on the slope behind the building. One trash heap was randomly selected, the dump behind Building 6; not surpris- ingly, it proved to be the largest sherd collection. For the one-room outbuildings, we selected Build? ings 13 and 40; the Building 33 collection had to be abandoned because the building is almost com? pletely buried in rock fall. Nonetheless, it did yield some interesting sherds and may be counted as the eighth sample. We used the dog-leash technique for the dump behind Building 6 but collected everything within the walls of Buildings 13 and 40 within the time limit. The pottery corpus gathered by this sampling method differs somewhat from a collection of at- tractive sherds that one tends to spot when walking over the site. Amphorae and cooking pots are much better represented in the sampled corpus, and some kinds of sherds were collected that would have been overlooked otherwise, such as the bur? nished sherd (fig. 29j) or the lamp (fig. 12). On the other hand, the "X-Group" painted cups and bowls and the polished and rouletted orange bowls and dishes are more sparsely represented. The pottery corpus from the 1992 season makes no claim whatsoever to being comprehensive, though it should be considerably expanded by an? other sample in the next season. These sherd col- lections together will provide at least some record of the surface material, and if excavation ever be undertaken, the surface collections should comple- ment the excavated sherds. THE POTTERY BY LISA A. HEIDORN One of the goals of the initial survey season at the ancient encampment, wells, and mine tailings at Bir Umm Fawakhir was to collect surface samples of sherds to date such features. Whitcomb and Meyer had drawn a number of surface sherds during brief visits to the site in 1978 and 1991 respectively. Their sketches formed a preliminary classification of pottery types which we used where applicable during the 1992 season. The sampling of eight small areas in 1992 resulted in the analysis and drawing in the field of 371 sherds. Half of the areas were sam? pled using the "dog leash" method (above). The di? agnostic and body sherds collected within in each circle during a five minute period were sorted, tal- lied, and left on site. The body sherds were counted on sherd sheets that noted wares and surface treat? ments. In most cases the surface color of the sherds was determined from the Munsell Soil Color Charts, and the readings are listed in the notes. Diagnostic pieces were drawn and described. The sampled sites, and the pottery collected from them, are discussed below. Some compari? sons with types from other sites in Egypt are given in Appendix B accompanying the descriptions of sherds. Both the ceramic analysis and the dating indicated by the ceramic remains should be consid? ered preliminary. Northwest of Modern Mosque: Southeast Edge of Preserved Ancient (?) Walls The collection of sherds from this site consisted of the surface sherds within a circular area measur? ing 2 m across. The center of the circle was on the northeast corner of a stone embedded in the earth. The stone was one of a number that appear to be lined up just below the surface, perhaps indicating the presence of an ancient wall. The sunken area north of the sample area?presently a convenient place for trash disposal?may be the interior of a building, and the earth mounded around the sunken trash dump may rest upon ancient walls. However, the site is close to the modern settlement and the road linking the towns of Quft on the Nile and Quseir on the Red Sea coast; only excavation could produce sherds from a less seriously dis? turbed context. The diagnostic sherds in this sample consisted of a reddish-brown amphora handle (fig. 27c), an</page><page sequence="62">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 59 amphora stump-base of the same reddish-brown fabric (fig. 27e), and two amphora rim sherds (fig. 27a, b). A sherd from a wide-mouthed jar with everted rim (fig. 27d) was also found. Thirty-three reddish-brown ware body sherds came from unidentifiable forms. However, other body sherds were from silt amphorae, including three neck fragments and one body fragment with ridged exterior. Two reddish-brown sherds had white-slipped exteriors(?). Area of Ancient (and Modern) Wells This collection consisted of surface sherds found near the western edge of the rock debris near the numerous ancient wells. The sherds were found on the level ground on the western side of one of the rubble mounds. This area has been reused throughout the millennia because it has easily at- tainable water, and the sherds amidst the debris around the ancient well heads undoubtedly repre? sent more than one time period. Due to the great amount of rock tumble in the area, it is difficult to discern the ground plans of any of the ancient con? structions that might have been located there. The diagnostic sherds on the surface in this area were numerous. They included the following: a reddish-brown amphora stump base (fig. 27q); a small knob base (fig. 27s); a reddish-brown am? phora handle (with traces of red slip?) (fig. 27r); an amphora rim with bulbous lip (fig. 27f); a marl handle with ridges on the exterior (fig. 27t); three silt bowl rims (fig. 27j-l); a rim from a small jar (fig. 27g); a jar or bottle rim with light-colored surfaces (fig. 27i); a wide-mouthed silt jar rim with red slip (fig. 27m); two wide-mouthed jar rims with interior ledges (fig. 27n-o); a light brown globular jar rim with a cream exterior (fig. 27p); and a reddish-brown channeled jar rim with light- colored slip partially preserved on exterior (fig. 27h); a sherd from a wide-mouth vat (fig. 28a); and a ring-base fragment (fig. 28b). Also collected during the survey were 27 red? dish-brown body sherds (two with ribbed exteriors), five sherds with red slips, seven reddish-brown silt sherds with light-colored slips, and one sherd made from a light-colored (marl?) clay. Mine Tailings South of Modern Road (Sites A and B) Two small sherd samples were collected in the dumps sloping down in front of the ancient mine entrances to the south of the Quft to Quseir road. Surface sherds were collected from a small area (Site A) on the northern slope of hill above the road. The sherds from the area, however, were chosen for their diagnostic value, and no body sherds were collected from the spot. The surface sherds of the main sample area (Site B) were gath- ered from within a 2 m circle on the western face of the eastern arm of the small bay. Site B was lo? cated on the arm of the bay opposite from and fac? ing Site A. Numerous mine entrances, paths, and probable wall remains are visible amidst the thick deposits of rock and debris covering the steep northern slope of this escarpment and the ground at its base. Only four rim sherds were collected from Site A. One neck and shoulder fragment belonged to a small globular jar with a neck ridge (fig. 28d); its fabric had some small chaff pieces and a few white particles added as temper. The other three sherds belonged to various reddish-brown silt bowl forms. The bowl shown in fig. 28f may in fact be a lid. The bowl sherds shown in fig. 28c and 28e have red slips on their interior and exterior surfaces. The diagnostic sherds from Site B included an amphora toe with a slight concave depression in base (fig. 28k); an amphora rim and neck (fig. 28g); a small lid or base fragment (fig. 28m); a reddish- brown cooking-pot rim with a handle scar and red slip on the exterior (fig. 28h). A small bowl with single channel on the exterior below rim (fig. 28i) and a marl bowl with an incised line below the rim on the exterior (fig. 28j) were also collected. The double-barreled jar handle with a thick red slip (fig. 281) may be the only imported sherd in this group. Also found at Site B were 29 reddish-brown body sherds, 1 coarse light-ware jar handle, and 6 reddish-brown sherds with light-colored slips on their exteriors. Dump Behind Building 6 Sherd debris was concentrated on a narrow area behind, and up the slope from, Building 6. The sample area chosen was behind this agglomerative building and within the sherd scatter of the trash dump. The housing complex and the dump were located at the base of a cliff. Numerous diagnostic sherds were collected from the site. They included the following: an amphora rim and neck with dark orange- to buff-colored surfaces (not illustrated, but see fig. 29g);8 two reddish-brown amphorae stump-bases (fig. 29n-o);</page><page sequence="63">60 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 a reddish-brown cooking pot with a "piecrust" rim (fig. 29a); a cup or bowl with orange slip and bur? nished surfaces (fig. 29b); a flanged silt bowl of reddish-brown ware with slip (fig. 29e); a carinated silt bowl with black spots atop the thickened rim (fig. 29c); two rim sherds from a (the same?) reddish-orange wide-mouthed jar (fig. 29h); a wide- mouthed, light-colored (marl?) jar rim and neck (fig. 29f); one reddish-brown and one light-colored ware jar handle (the latter shown in fig. 291); one light- colored shoulder and neck fragment with part of a handle preserved and ribbed profile (fig. 29g); a fine reddish-brown shoulder and body sherd with a few exterior ridges (fig. 29i); a silt bowl rim with bur? nished exterior (fig. 29d); a base fragment with rem- nants of a bright orange exterior slip (fig. 29k); and a buff ware ring-base (with greenish core) like the example shown in fig. 29m. There were also 21 reddish-brown body sherds, 16 light-colored body sherds (mostly ribbed ones), and 1 pink sherd with a burnished orange surface. A number of body sherds in this group merit separate description. Decorated sherds include an orange sherd with red exterior (slipped?) and black painted decoration (fig. 29p), a reddish-brown sherd with black decoration (fig. 29q), and one incised orange bowl fragment with a purple-gray burnished exterior and black burnished interior (fig. 29j). Other body sherds include 20 light orange (around 2.5 YR 6/8 in surface color) fragments, some with exterior rib? bing; two light pink (lighter than 2.5 YR 6/6) sherds with ribbed profiles, and two others of the same sur? face color but with a lot of black and sandy temper; 21 orange-brown sherds (ranging from 2.5 YR 5/6 to 6/8) some with exterior ribbing; and a ribbed pink sherd (5 YR 7/3) with an orange exterior surface. It is unclear which of the sherds were manufactured of typical Egyptian clay and which may have been imported. Building 13 This sample consisted of all surface sherds within a small square outbuilding. The sherds were collected from the middle of the hut in an attempt to lessen contamination from sherds falling out of wall crevices where they had been placed as chink- ing during the construction of the hut. It is, of course, not certain which of the disturbed surface sherds are contemporary with the occupation or construction of this building. The diagnostic sherds included a carinated shoulder and rim sherd of a buff-colored jar (fig. 30e); a silt vat with white and black decoration (fig. 30a); a dark reddish-gray jar rim with combed bands on the exterior of the body (fig. 30c) and a reddish-brown sherd with a portion of a handle from the same jar (?) (fig. 30b); and two cooking- pot rims (fig. 30d). There were also 14 reddish- brown body sherds. Most of these silt sherds had ribbed exteriors, and one had cord marks on its exterior. Also collected from Building 13 were six light-colored ("buff") body sherds with ribbed exteriors, two coarse marl sherds whose greenish exteriors bore two bands of combed lines, and one reddish-brown body sherd with combing on its exterior surface. Slope Below Building 33 This sample consisted of two sherds from the surface of the slope below a circular structure des- ignated Building 33, located at the base of an es? carpment. The sherds were retained because of their unique shapes and wares. One is probably a base fragment of a small jar (fig. 30g), and the other was from a handmade jar with incised deco? ration (fig. 30f). Building 37 This sample area consisted of a rectilinear building of six rooms. All surface sherds found in the middles of the rooms were collected. The sherds adjacent to the walls were once again avoided to lessen contamination from sherds that might have fallen from wall chinking. The only di? agnostic sherd was an orange, flanged bowl with red slip and exterior rouletting (fig. 30h). A sign had been scratched on the interior, perhaps a sim- plified Chi-Rho. The other reddish brown sherds from this build? ing consisted of 14 body sherds, 4 sherds with light-colored slip, 2 sherds with a red slip, and 1 light brown fragment with red slip (possibly manu? factured of a marl and silt clay mixture). Six sherds of fine marl clay were also collected here. Building 40 The sherd sample was collected from within a circular outbuilding on the hillside. The hut was ruinous, and the sample may be considered a con? tinuation of the trash mounds located up the steep slope from this building. The diagnostic sherds in? cluded a reddish-brown amphora handle with part</page><page sequence="64">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 61 of the neck; a carinated bowl (fig. 30i); a small marl cooking-pot with horizontal handles, incised rim and corrugated exterior (fig. 30k); a bowl with a thickened rim and corrugation on the exterior below the carinated mid-section (fig. 30n); a rim from a wide-mouthed vat like that shown in fig. 30a;9 a wide-mouthed marl jar (fig. 30m); a red- slipped bowl or jar rim (fig. 30j); and a fragment from a carinated silt bowl (fig. 301). Two marl ring-bases like the base illustrated in fig. 29m,10 and a base of a globular cup or small jar (fig. 30o) were also found. In addition, there were 29 reddish-brown body sherds (some of these were ribbed amphorae sherds), 1 reddish-brown sherd with light-colored coating on the exterior, 3 reddish-brown sherds with red slip on the interiors and/or exteriors (one is a ribbed jar sherd), and 15 marl body sherds. Surface Sample Three interesting sherds were noted from areas not systematically collected. A handle and rim fragment was picked up from the surface near the western approach to the main settlement (fig. 30p). The handle is made of clay fired to a pink color and has an orange exterior surface or slip. It may be part of a cooking pothandle and rim. The other two surface sherds are described with "Slope be? low Building 33." The Pottery Dating The analysis of the sherds from the 1992 season at Bir Umm Fawakhir has established tentative dates for some of the sherds and survey ed areas. The sherd scatter in the area northwest of the mod? ern mosque included fragments of amphorae which clearly date to the first and second centuries a.d. when compared with excavated materials from other sites in Egypt. But the sherd sample was small, and it was collected from an area greatly disturbed by modern activity. The sampled sites around the wells and downslope from the mine en? trances were also areas much disturbed by human activity. The materials collected in the survey of the sites included sherds ranging in date from the early Roman to the Coptic periods (and later?) in Egypt. Most of the sherds collected within the main settlement, however, can be roughly dated between a.d. 400 and 600. The comparative mate? rials used in dating the types do not allow us at this time to date the ancient settlement more narrowly. SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF THE 1992 SURVEY The goal of the Bir Umm Fawakhir Survey was to document the surface remains of the site and thus preserve a record of it, and to investigate more thoroughly the nature of the site, which to date has almost always been called Roman rather than Byzantine. In 12 days we mapped approxi? mately one quarter of the community in the main wadi, sampled the sherds, and clarified some ques? tions about the different periods of occupation. The Ptolemaic presence remains elusive, although it definitely was documented in early travelers' ac- counts and perhaps was attested by the concave crushing stones. The Roman remains are far more skimpy than formerly believed; we do have the Roman tower, the first-second century graffiti, some sherds, and probably the granite quarries, but no obvious, fortified way station like Wekalat Zarka or others on the Quft-Quseir road. The mys- terious cut stone wall near the modern mosque may be Roman, judging from the sherds collected in its vicinity. The geological study explains many features of the site, why it exists and why it is laid out the way it is. The title of this article, "Gold, Granite, and Water," summarizes the most important resources of the site. Precambrian granite is the aquifer feed- ing the wells that made it possible to use this cara- van route through the desert and to build a settlement the size of Bir Umm Fawakhir. Perhaps the most important geological features, however, are the gold quartz veins in the granite. We also know that granite blocks were cut from two rather modest quarries, but we do not know why those spots were chosen rather than any of the other masses of granite all around. Small granite blocks and cobbles were the building material for the houses. Standing at the wells, we can see where erosion has dissected, deeply, the Fawakhir granite into numerous wadis, some broad, some narrow. The broad ones permitted passage of the caravans between the Nile and the Red Sea, and one of the long, narrow, steep-sided wadis enclosed the main Byzantine settlement, which is further constricted by a series of fault structures and the felsite dyke running nearly at right angles to the wadi axis. These are the points at which the wadi narrows or nearly closes, the final constriction forming a natu? ral gate at the southeast end of the site. We can begin to see the pattern of the ancient community with buildings strung along either side</page><page sequence="65">62 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 of the sandy wadi bottom. There was no formal town planning; the landform determined the lay out of the settlement. From the maze of walls and doors and rooms we can now discern three main kinds of buildings: a two- or three-room house, an agglomerated unit made up of two or more con? nected houses, and one-room outbuildings. All are constructed of unworked native granite, apparently unmortared but well chinked with small stones or sherds. Some of the houses were altered, enlarged, or even annexed by a neighboring house, although each building unit nonetheless preserved some space separating it from the next. Trash was dumped outside the houses or at the foot of the cliffs behind them, a practice that has a great deal of potential for archaeological investigation. There is no compelling reason to consider the occupants slaves or prisoners as described in Diodorus' much earlier account. The buildings sprawl along the wadi, and although the houses fall into an iden- tifiable pattern of several rooms and a generally similar amount of space, the specific layout of any one house seems quite idiosyncratic. Most houses even have modest built-in comforts such as benches or storage niches. In short, there is no sign of the regimented quarters or tight control ex- pected for slaves or prisoners. The rest of our conclusions are more questions than answers. Who were the ancient inhabitants? What was their relation to the Nile valley? Does the presence of a rather considerable amount of Nubian style pottery suggest a connection to Nu- bia? The clear layout of the community will permit a useful estimate of the number of residents, though we postponed this until the next season's mapping is completed. What of the means of sup? ply and support? This must have come from the Valley, and the large amphorae could have con? tained any of a variety of victuals, but so far we lack storehouses, animal lines, and even ovens. A study of the bones and bone splinters from the trash heaps should provide information about the kinds of animals present. We still do not know, for certain, what ancient Bir Umm Fawakhir was doing there; the four most probable functions seem to be gold mining, granite quarrying, serving the Nile-Red Sea long distance trade, or military. Although we know that gold was extracted from Bir Umm Fawakhir in antiquity, it is not clear whether mining occurred in the Byzantine, Roman, Ptolemaic, or earlier periods, or at several different times. We could look to both the mines and their vicinity and to the main group of ruins for evi? dence. If Byzantine Bir Umm Fawakhir was pri? marily a gold mining camp, then we have the following expectations: (1) We expect mining tools and debris both from hacking out the gold-bearing veins in the mountainsides and from crushing and washing the gold quartz. The area at the foot of the mines has been thoroughly disturbed by modern mining activity. Washing tables, if any, are no longer in evidence (see Vercoutter 1959 for gold washing tables). The only information pertaining to ore extraction so far comes from the concave crushing stones, pound- ers, and the rotary mills. The crushing stones need reinspection and closer dating, and Byzantine min? ing techniques in general need further research. (2) We also expect smithies for repairing metal implements. We might also find some construction near the adits, if only because some of the shafts are vertical or nearly so and some sort of platform for hauling men and ore out would be needed. As mentioned, there are no surviving indica- tions of mining-related buildings at the foot of the mines, although there are some dry stone platforms and hut circles near some of the adits. Is there enough associated pottery to suggest a date? (3) We expect a mining camp to be fairly short- lived. When the ore is mined out, the miners leave, especially in an environment as harsh as the East? ern Desert. There is little evidence that Byzantine Bir Umm Fawakhir grew slowly from the northwest end to the southeast or vice versa. All of the buildings in- spected so far have the same kind of construction and general layout pattern. The same holds for at least two of the outliers as well. Some of the houses have been altered but so far as can now be determined, no more than might be expected in several decades. There is no layering of building upon building; enough of the looters' holes reach bedrock to demonstrate this. Against this expecta- tion of a short life span of the community we have an amazing amount of pottery. The duration of the site could be investigated by: (a) test excavations in the trash heaps to investigate the stratigraphy and to see what differences there may be in sherds from top to bottom; (b) statistical comparison of excavated (non-migrated) sherds from either end of the site. The basic repertoire of sherds is the same from one end of the site to another, but quan- titative differences might be detected. It will be critical to distinguish chronological differences</page><page sequence="66">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 63 from functional ones; (c) further study of the non- bonded walls, blocked doorways, and alterations to the houses. (4) If Bir Umm Fawakhir is in fact short-lived, we should be able to narrow the rather broad fifth- seventh century range of preliminary pottery dates. The best evidence is likely to come from ostraca or coins, but that would require excavation. Pottery comparisons to Valley sites are not likely to be as useful, given that most Valley sites are quite long- lived and the Byzantine pottery broadly dated, if treated at all. In fact, as a one-period site Bir Umm Fawakhir is more likely to assist in dating other sites than vice versa. (5) In a mining camp we expect working class goods. High status or costly goods should be at a minimum. On the one hand, we have no indication of slave or prisoners' quarters, but on the other, the houses are all fairly modest and reasonably similar in size and facilities. It will be important to define "costly" in terms of fine ceramics, manufactured goods, or the elegant Coptic textiles. (6) For a gold mine, we expect a fairly high level of administrative control of the workforce, supplies, and above all, the product. All major ventures in the Eastern Desert were, until the present day, supported to some degree by the cur- rent government. The pharaonic mining expedi? tions often were carried out by high officials. Most of the Roman merchants traveling through the desert may have represented private consortia, but the government built and maintained the roads, wells, and way stations, provided protection, and collected a 25 percent tax. In the Mamluk period, a group of extremely wealthy merchants, the karim, handled most of the India trade via the Red Sea, but they too were aided and protected by the gov? ernment (Meyer 1992). In the Byzantine period, we have as yet no evidence that any private indi? vidual or consortium could have financed a venture such as the Bir Umm Fawakhir mines, and in fact we have virtually no literary evidence for Byzan? tine exploitation of the Eastern Desert. Whatever the case, the Byzantine government exercised, or tried to exercise, such rigid control over the lives of the populace in the Valley that it seems unlikely that they ignored something as potentially lucra- tive as a gold mine. We would expect some sort of administrative headquarters, a governor's resi? dence, a warehouse for provisions, a strong room perhaps, and above all accounts and ostraca. (7) We expect some degree of protection for the gold produced, both at the site and for the jour- ney to the capital. Guardposts to warn of raids and some armed guards would be expected, but not a full military installation. The tops of the ridges overlooking the site do have numerous pot drops and should be inspected more closely for watch stations. We also know that granite was quarried at Bir Umm Fawakhir, one quarry lying near the northern outlier by the Roman road (see fig. 3), and the sec? ond, smaller quarry in the main group of ruins. The first problem, however, is to determine whether the quarries themselves are Roman or Byzantine, and the earlier date seems the likelier. The tool marks match the ones at Roman Mons Claudianus, the Romans were more avid collectors of exotic luxury stones than the Byzantine rulers, and the fifth to seventh century settlement is far too large for the modest quarries in question. There are, nonetheless, several lines of inquiry that could help date the granite quarries. (1) The best dating evidence is likely to be the tool marks. As noted, they seem to match Roman cutting marks from other granite quarries in the Eastern Desert, but on the other hand, Byzantine granite quarrying techniques are unstudied as yet. (2) The second, small quarry lies in the main group of ruins quite close to the houses. Inspection of the area might provide some clues as to the quarrying/building sequence here. (3) If the granite quarries were Roman, we would expect traces of housing, sherds, and tools. To date, none have been found and sherds (apart from amphorae) may never have been abundant at an actual working site. Furthermore, the Byzantine sherds now predominate over the whole site. A second possibility is that granite quarrying was a sideline for the Byzantine town. If such were the case, we would look for features a little differ? ent from a gold mining camp. (1) We expect a workmen's camp, though not necessarily a short-lived one, as granite is unlikely ever to be worked out. Granite quarrying will in- stead depend on the ability to organize and provi- sion the workmen, the capacity to transport the blocks, and especially on the demand for exotic luxury stones. (2) A quarrymen's camp would be no more lux- urious than a gold miners', so again we would ex? pect few if any costly goods. (3) Above all, we expect signs of the transport used for hauling the blocks to the Nile, which means animal traction. Camels are attested as draft animals hauling stones from Mons Porphyrites</page><page sequence="67">64 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 (Raschke 1978: 884), but oxen were far more com- monly employed. We would look for several fea? tures: animal lines or shelter, water troughs, and a track improved sufficiently for oxen and heavy blocks and carts. Such features may never be found because the modern asphalt road has long since obliterated the old camel and cart tracks. Also, none of the Wadi Hammamat hydreumata have animal lines such as those found at the ancient stations on the Qena road. (4) Protection for a quarry would be limited to the men themselves and the animals. Raiders do not want multi-ton granite blocks. We know that an important Roman trade route, as marked by the intervisible towers, passed by Bir Umm Fawakhir, and we suspect that it and its wells served as a way station on the Nile-Red Sea road, though it seems to lack a fortified way station such as the one at Wekalat Zarka. If the Byzantine settlement also acted as a way station for the desert caravans, we have yet another set of expectations. (1) We would look for facilities for traveling caravans, primarily water, shelter, and protection from raids. The Roman and Mamluk caravans may have counted hundreds of animals, as estimated from the tonnage needed to fill a middle-sized Red Sea vessel (Meyer 1992). Unfortunately we have almost no information on the Byzantine desert car? avans or Red Sea ships. We would expect watering troughs, animal lines, some protection for the cara- van's bundles and bales of valuable goods, and perhaps a caravanserai. None of these is in evi? dence, though the area closest to the wells is thor- oughly disturbed. (2) There would be relatively few permanent residents at a desert way station. (3) We would expect some evidence of the im- port and export goods, which were mostly items of considerable value. A few items might have been consumed on site, and somewhat more broken or abandoned in transit. The meager evidence for Byzantine trade on the Red Sea and Indian Ocean coasts has been reviewed above, namely Justinian's treaty with Axum and the routes through Clysma, Antinoopolis, and Berenice. (4) We would expect some protection of the resting place and of the caravans en route, perhaps no more than a stout walled enclosure for the one and armed guards for the other. We know from the first-second century ostraca that Bir Umm Fawakhir had a military function in the Roman period and that security against desert tribes or raiders was always a concern. The possi? bility that Bir Umm Fawakhir functioned primarily as a military base, however, is not seriously con? sidered. The site lacks any major fortifications or defenses except what was given by its natural, sheltered location. Small guard posts on the tops of the ridges may be expected, but have not yet been located. Bir Umm Fawakhir has no resemblance to the Byzantine fort at DAbu Shacar, which has a rectangular defensive wall, corner towers, a tow- ered gate, a regular street plan, barracks, and a focal, main building (Sidebotham et al. 1989: 130). Byzantine military control of the Eastern Desert seems to have been sporadic at best. In sum, Bir Umm Fawakhir represents a spe? cial opportunity to study an entire ancient commu? nity from its reason for existence down to its very trash heaps, with or without excavation. Our brief project in 1992 not only rendered the site much more comprehensible but made it one of the best- studied Byzantine settlements in the Eastern Desert. Along with sites such as DAbu Shacar, Bir Nakheil, and what can be gleaned concerning Berenice, we can begin to ask questions about the Byzantine exploitation of the Eastern Desert. We hope in the future to continue mapping the site and to pursue some of these questions about the region, the function of Bir Umm Fawakhir itself, and the people who lived there. APPENDIX A DESCRIPTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS Building 1. A small, nearly circular outbuilding near the southeast "gate." Although Building 1 is in a good position for a guard post, it looks toward the settle? ment not out from it. Building 2 (see Building 12). A small, rectangular outbuilding near the southeast "gate." The northwest wall is partly collapsed, but the door seems to have been at the north corner. The large amount of tumbled rock in front suggests the possibility of a small terrace there. Building 3. A seven-room house consisting of one three-room and one four-room unit. The room without a door probably had one in its northeast wall; it is badly tumbled whereas the other three rooms are fairly well preserved. The northernmost corner of the building has</page><page sequence="68">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 65 :SS'&gt;^T. ^^^^^^^5r^^t-ic:^l&lt;^ Fig. 13.

Building 6. been washed away by wadi floods. The apse-like feature, which is backed into the talus slope from the felsite dyke, may represent part of a circular outbuilding "captured" by Building 3. The very narrow passage between the two house units is not yet explained, although other, un- mapped houses have similar features. Building 3 has five benches, of which three are looted; it has no preserved niches, but none of the walls now stand very high. Building 4. A partly destroyed two-room house that nonetheless has two niches and remnants of a bench. Building 5 (fig. 13). An eight-room, three-unit house. Two of the doors are questionable, though given the preservation of the walls it is difficult to see where else they could have been. The northernmost rounded room is ruined down to the height of a single stone. The best- preserved doorway shows clearly in fig. 13. Four of the five benches have been looted, and the fifth looters' hole may mark the location of another bench. There are only two preserved niches, the southernmost one of which has no back and so resembles a window. Building 6 (fig. 14). A rambling, thirteen-room house with units of two, four, four, and three rooms. Building 6 is backed against a cliff and granite boulders on the southwest; the larger looters' hole reaches granite bed? rock. Two sets of walls are double thick, one set on the cliff side, the other on the northeast front, suggesting that the rooms so enclosed were added later. The whole cliff slope behind Buildings 39, 6, and 7 is dense with potsherds, probably representing debris from those buildings. Building 6 had at least six niches, and two up- right stones by the looter's hole seem to indicate that it was once a bench. Building 7 (fig. 15). A three-room house. The back- most room is built against the cliff, and only the line of</page><page sequence="69">66 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 Fig. 15. Building 7 at lower left, Buildings 9, 10, 11 at foot of talus slope. boulders suggests the original position of part of the back wall. Apart from a piece of the door jamb, the par? tition wall is almost totally lose in stone tumble. Build? ing 7 is noteworthy mainly for one room that has an especially large number of niches, five. Starting at the door and running counterclockwise, their maximum di- mensions are: 30 cm wide x 33 (top gone); 30 x 28 x ca. 38 deep; 29 x ca. 30 x ca. 34 deep; 29 x 30; 35 x 30 x ca. 30 deep. A rectangular, concave grinding stone rests in the room with the niches, and a small looters' hole has been grubbed in the south corner. Note the jointed gran? ite in the foreground. Building 8. One-room outbuilding. Only two walls and a bit of a third are preserved. The back wall, on the cliff side, is lost and most of the structure filled with rocks and sherds. Here we found the best specimen of a Coptic stamped bowl (fig. 10). Building 9 (fig. 15). Building 9 now consists of two walls and a remnant which is reduced to a single face of stones running towards Building 4. If anything more ex? isted between them, it is now lost in the litter of small stones falling off the felsite dyke. The west wall of Building 4 is curiously bowed inside. Building 10 (fig. 15). Building 10 is an exceptionally well constructed one-room outbuilding. The doorway is made of carefully stacked large stones surviving 90 cm high, and the room has two built-in niches. This of all the outbuildings has the most resemblance to a small house, and the single row of stones in the retaining wall gives the illusion of linking Building 10 to Building 11. Building 11 (fig. 15). A fairly large three- (or four?-) room house at the southwest end of the side wadi. Parts of this building are badly damaged. Wall collapse and rock fall from the slope of the felsite dyke have obliter- ated a possible cross wall and filled the cliffside room or rooms. Looters have dug one hole in the bench in the front room, and an exceptionally deep hole in the back room. It is roughly 0.5 m deep (it is hard to measure be? cause of the debris piled around it) and seems to go through wadi cobbles to bedrock. On the other hand, the remnants of the outside bench are as yet untouched. The front room has four niches; running clockwise from the door their maximum dimensions are: 43 cm wide x 42 (top gone) x 35 deep; (damaged) 28 x 22 high x 30 deep; 31 x 24 (top gone) x 22 deep; (damaged) at least 32 cm high. In the southwest room four niches could not be reached for accurate measurement because of the looters' hole inside and the rock fall outside; we did not wish to climb the walls and so topple more stones. The other two niches were badly broken. We did note, how? ever, that the two southwest niches look more like win? dows than niches. The sill on one seems to run through to the outside wall, and in this case the possibility of a real window or windows must be considered. Building 12 (fig. 13, 16). Probably two house units plus two attached rooms. Of the latter, the round one has a bench and two doors, but the southwest room is re- duced to a rim of single stones. Unfortunately it is im- possible to determine whether or not the walls are bonded without moving a considerable amount of wall fall. The larger of the two house units now has four rooms, although at one time the back room may have been partitioned into two. The unit has at least one bench and a circle of stones that might mark a hearth. The smaller, three-room house unit has one bench and may have had a second in the room with the niches. The niche above the looters' hole measures 30 cm wide x (top and bottom gone) x 35 deep; the second niche is mostly destroyed. Wall fall and the large looter's hole plus its debris fill almost half the room. The small room at the south end of the unit may have been added, but the bonding or lack of it is not visible.</page><page sequence="70">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 67 ^^ii?^fe~ -v ~"'-;^g^ .??-"?; ?? sgw; Fig. 16. Building 12 at center, Building 13 to left, Buildings 2 and 15 on slope behind. Building 13 (fig. 16). A one-room outbuilding with a bench. It is unusual in that it has two doors. Building 14. A two- or three-room house. The west- ernmost wall is destroyed to the level of the face of one line of stones, and the door is completely lost. It is not even clear whether this area was completely walled or roofed; its main feature is the stone-lined feature tenta- tively called a basin or trough. If lined and sealed it could have held water for domestic or craft purposes, or perhaps even for animals. If roofed, it might have served for stor? age like the small cellar in the "Roman Villa" at Quseir al-Qadim (Meyer 1982: 203). There are several small looters' pits around Building 14, but the largest is in the former bench inside. Two niches and an exterior bench have survived, however. The niches in the room with the looted bench measures 22 cm x 20 x 20 deep; the one in the south room is ca. 20 cm wide x 25 high. Artifacts found in Building 14 include the base fragment of a glass lamp (fig. 12) and two bashed and broken quartz pounding stones, ca. 6.3 cm and 9 cm in diameter respectively. A broad dump area runs behind Buildings 12, 13, and 14. The surface has been fairly thoroughly dug into by looters, but a few surface finds may be noted: a roughly rectangular granite crushing stone measuring ca. 27 x 17 x 9 cm, a cobalt blue glass fragment, and what seems to be the neck of a jar or beaker of light olive green glass. Building 15 (fig. 16). A small, circular, one-room out? building built into the slope behind Buildings 12 and 13. Building 16. A small, one-room outbuilding, nearly tri? angular in shape. Built into the slope behind Building 14. Building 17. One of the most regular of the houses, yet with some unusual features. It seems to consist of a four- and a three-room unit, plus a large central room. The door to this room is an unusually broad 93 cm, so the "room" could conceivably have been a courtyard. It is graced by a small looters' hole and a large one that yielded some fragments of bone. Close to the door is a rectangular, concave crushing stone; another lies just outside the house. The four-room southwest house unit has one looters' hole, possibly representing a former bench. The northeast three-room house has two looted benches and a circle of stones, possibly a hearth. The threshold to the back room, however, consists of a piece of porphyry, apparently the upper part of a rotary crush? ing stone broken in half. Building 18. One-room outbuilding with two doors. Building 19. A badly tumbled two-room house with three doors, a bench, and a niche, 37 cm wide x (top missing) x 34 deep. A partial row of stones appears to connect Building 19 to Building 18. Building 20. One-room outbuilding scarcely pre? served more than one stone high. The northwest corner has been completely washed away. A rim of stones in front of it in the wadi may represent another outbuilding. Sherds are abundant behind Buildings 19 and 20. Building 21. One room with a bench is detectable, plus a possible rectangular feature outside. Building 21 is so badly destroyed that the plan became clear only when the wall remnants were mapped. The fragmentary walls upstream in the wadi bed may be retaining walls. This end of the wadi has been particularly eroded and filled with sand by wadi wash. Building 22. A small, one-room outbuilding, two walls of which consist of an angle in the cliff behind it. A low retaining wall may have formed a step or platform up to Building 22. Building 23. Very meager remains, scarcely project? ing above ground surface. There is no clear doorway. A line of stones between Buildings 23 and 22 forms a low retaining wall below the cliff. Building 24. A three-room house. It has two benches outside the front door and two interior niches, one ca. 20</page><page sequence="71">68 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 Fig. 17.

Building 24 is fairly well preserved, and the door jambs to the rounded back room still stand over a meter high. The puzzling feature is the possible niche on the outside. Fig. 18. Building 27, doorway with concave grinding stone. Building 25. Appears to be a one-room outbuilding built against the cliff face. The remains are badly dam? aged and confusing. Although the area to the east now is littered with sherds and debris, there may have been an? other room there on a higher level. The "retaining wall" no longer preserves enough evidence to prove that it was once a real wall, though there is enough rock tumble to the south to account for one. We did detect the remnant of a wall, possibly with a door, that might have con? nected Buildings 24 and 25 at one time. The easiest path up to Building 26 runs uphill from the sherd dump be? hind Building 25. Building 26. A tiny, one-room outbuilding set against a cliff face above Buildings 25 and 27. Building 27 (fig. 17, 18). Appears to consist of two (or three) two-room house units plus later modifications and additions to the east and south. This is one of the best preserved buildings mapped in 1992. The western unit has a small rounded back room and a trapezoidal front room; the wall between is so badly tumbled that only one possible door jamb can be seen. Near the loot? ers' hole in the front room rests part of a sandstone trough. What remains is a rectangular piece 12 cm high, 26 long, and 19 wide before the break. The interior is pecked. Sandstone is not native to the area, though the nearest outcrops of Nubian sandstone are not far west of Bir Hammamat. The main entrance to the rest of the house from the wadi "street" leads into a large room, perhaps even a courtyard, that in turn opens north into a large, irregular room and east into another set of four rooms. If divided, the irregular room would make a nor- mal two-room house, but unfortunately there is no sign of a partition wall. Alternatively, the irregular room may be a later enclosure; its south wall abuts rather than joins the wall on the east, and its west wall seems to be a double wall with the rounded room; it is not known whether the third wall angle abuts another room. What</page><page sequence="72">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 69 K:, .?jSk?-., Jv-Aifctt: Fig. 19. Building 29. the room does have, however, is a stone-rimmed feature in one corner with ash in it, and more ash in another corner. The features presumably represent one or two hearths. The eastern set of four rooms has one small looters' hole, one niche (half preserved), and one win- dow. The window sill is now 58 cm above the floor but flush with the path on the east side of Building 27, so it might have served for secondary access. A piece of a rectangular, concave crushing stone lies on the floor of this room, and a similar crushing stone may be seen in a doorway leading north. Figure 16 shows the stone and two doorways, the nearer preserved almost 2 m high. Just inside and to the right of the door with the crushing stone is another looted bench. The last room in the unit is built against the cliff face, actually on granite boul? ders for part of the east wall. The boulders project like a handy shelf. Behind Building 27 is a row of large boul? ders that encloses the third side of a small space be? tween the cliff and the back of the house. One curved and two straight walls or retaining walls further up the slope are too poorly preserved to determine their func? tion. Finally, a large looters' hole has been dug behind Building 27. Building 28 (fig. 17). Probably a two-room house. Only the back part of two rounded rooms of Building 28 survive, with one niche. The rectangular feature in front is made of granite cobbles and chinked. Some of the cobbles seem burnt. The whole of the sandy bay behind Building 28 and up the slope is littered with potsherds. Building 29 (fig. 19). A two-room house with two rooms (or courtyards?) added on. The walls of the east and south rooms abut the house proper where they meet. The two wadi-side doors and the possible bench are badly ruined. Part of the house's interior wall is tumbled; the niche measures 17 cm wide x 20 cm high. The area between Building 29 and the cliff delimited by two re? taining walls is dense with sherds. Building 30. One-room outbuilding, roughly rectan? gular. The corner between it and the cliff is part of the Building 29 sherd dump. Building 31. One-room outbuilding with one exterior and one possible interior bench. If there ever was an? other room to the south, it has been washed away by the wadi. Building 32. One-room, rounded outbuilding. The back wall is built up against the boulders of the cliff; the front is lost in rock fall. Building 33. One-room, rounded outbuilding, now consisting of a low circle of stones built up against some granite boulders. Building 34 (fig. 13). Two-room house. This house was built close to a steep cliff face, and the east wall in- corporated a large boulder. The front room has a large bench. Eastward, towards Building 30 or Building 31, is an ashy area that may be a dump, a working area, or re? mains of a modern fire. Between Building 34 and the cliff is a row of rocks that may have served as a retaining wall; the area immediately west is a sherd dump. Building 35 (fig. 13). Probably a one-room outbuild? ing now marked chiefly by a line of stones against the cliff face and a large looters' hole. The line of the other three walls can barely be traced. Building 36 (fig. 13, with tripod and prism pole lean- ing against a wall). One-room outbuilding. Although the walls are thick and relatively well preserved, wall fall obscures the possible door locations. Building 37 (fig. 20, 21, 22). A large, agglomerated house consisting of two three-room units and two added- on rooms. The latter might be interpreted as another two-room house, but given their small size and periph- eral location we are, for now, calling them subsidiary rooms. Neither is bonded to the other or to the main house; the back room utilizes the cliff face. The middle unit of three rooms seems to consist of a two-room</page><page sequence="73">70 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 Fig. 20. Building 37 at center, Building 38 to left. Note jointed granite. Fig. 21.

The southeast courtyard wall changes angle abruptly at an abutted joint. Its back wall is built over large boulders and now forms a sort of terrace between the room and the cliff, the terrace being littered with sherds. The final three-room house, judging from the double walls and the abutting front wall, seems to have been modified at some time, though the sequence is not yet clear. The front room had at least two niches (left, 30 cm wide x 36 x 33 deep; right ca. 24 wide x 30 x 28) though more may have been destroyed when the rest of the wall collapsed. The southwest room had two benches, now mostly hid- den by wall fall. A rounded quartz pounding stone also was found here. The space behind this house and the cliff is another sherd dump; the odd walls that mark it off on the northwest and southeast are actually taking ad- vantage of granite ledges. Building 38 (fig. 20). A two-room house built against the cliff face. One wall seems to have been founded on a line of boulders, and another boulder was used as a bench. The front room, however, had no good door, although it does have a normal bench and a blocked doorway. For a house, it is unusual in having no commu? nication between the two rooms. Building 39 (fig. 23). Apparently a two-room house with two attached rooms. The main room of Building 39 has one looters' hole and three niches; running clockwise from the door they measure 30 cm wide x 35 high; not measured; 30 cm wide x (top damaged) x 35 deep. The north corner of the room is broken up. Of the two at-</page><page sequence="74">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 71 '^^^^^^mm: Fig. 22.

The room with the grind? ing stone is damaged and the front wall(s) unclear. Building 40 (fig. 23). One-room outbuilding con? structed against a retaining wall on the cliff slope. The area between Buildings 39 and 40 is dense with sherds. The sole fragment of a ceramic lamp was collected here. Building 41 (fig. 23). A large agglomeration of at least two, perhaps as many as four house units. The northeast face of Building 41 has been damaged by wadi wash and the whole complex appears to have been added on to or reworked several times. Reference to the plan is crucial to following the description of this building. The southernmost two-room "house" seems to consist of a fairly large room added on to a back room that, in turn, may be contiguous with the eastern unit of three rooms. This unit has been damaged, but it does seem to have two large rooms with a bench, another looted shelf or bench, and a small corner room. The northwest one-room unit looks like an outbuilding "captured" by Building 41, though whether the room or rooms in between constituted another house is unclear. Neither the possible door on the wadi side nor the possible cross wall (which would en- close a back room) at the rear are certain. Finally, the westernmost unit defies interpretation at this stage. There is a large sandy area from which two rooms are separated or partly separated. The partly separated room has a wall niche measuring 27 cm wide x 22 high. A blocked door facing northwest does nothing to simplify the picture. Three sherd dumps are associated with Building 41.</page><page sequence="75">72 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 Fig. 24. Building 42. Niches on two levels. Fig. 25. Building 49 on left, Build? ing 48 on right. Building 42 (fig. 23, 24). A two-room house. This well-preserved house had eight niches, and perhaps two more in the tumbled west and east walls of the back room. The two in the front room (clockwise) measure 22 cm wide x 24 to sand (no back; it now looks like a cat door), and 34 cm wide x 22 to sand x 38 deep. The niches in the second room (clockwise) measure ca. 32 cm wide x 25 (top gone) x 38 deep; 34 cm wide (top, bottom, back gone); damaged; 49 cm wide x 37 x 44 deep; 35 cm x 30 high x 30 deep; 34 wide x ca. 37 high x 32 cm. A piece of a mortar was found in the front room. It appears to be made of a white nummultic lime? stone, not a native rock at Bir Umm Fawakhir. Lime? stone is not useful for crushing gold quartz either. The second room produced the sole mud brick noted so far. Building 43 (fig. 23). A two-room house. Two sides are built into the cliff slopes, so the exceptionally thick walls may have been necessary to hold back rock fall. The front door is obscured by tumbled stones. The larger room has two benches, looted, and one damaged niche. The wall between the rooms seems very thick, and wall fall has obliterated the door. The back room is on a higher level than the front room. Its niche measures 34 cm wide x 30 x 36 deep; the back wall might have had one or two niches as well. A rectangular, concave crush? ing stone lay on the slope down from the front door. Building 44 (fig. 26). A three-room house with a possible bench and six niches. Counting clockwise from the front door, the niches measure 33 cm wide x 32 x 37 deep; 26 x 32 high x 33 deep; damaged; 52 wide x (top</page><page sequence="76">1994 THE BIR UMM FAWAKHIR SURVEY PROJECT 1992 73 Fig. 26. Building 50 in foreground, Building 55 in the angle with cliff, wadi street. damaged) x 31 deep. The ones in the back room (clock- wise) measure 36 cm across x 42 high x 33; and 39 cm x (bottom damaged) x 24 deep. The slope behind Building 44 toward Building 43 is a sherd dump. Building 45. A two-room house built against the cliff face. The walls are now tumbled, but there is some indi- cation that each of the rooms had a niche. Building 46. Badly ruined on the wadi side. Only one door is well preserved, but Building 46 did have two rooms and probably a bench. The wall running to the cliff seems to enclose a courtyard or working area, now littered with sherds. The niche is dubious. Building 47. A three-room house. Two rooms con- nect, the third being reached by its own door. Wadi wash has tumbled walls and damaged a possible exterior bench. Building 48 (fig. 25). An unusual one-room building. It has two or three niches and a possible bench, and it is as large as some of the two-room houses such as Build? ing 4 or Building 38, but there is no sign of an interior wall. The two doors are also unusual, and the one un- bonded corner suggests that the building might have been modified. A low retaining wall runs towards Build? ing 46, and the slope behind Building 48 is another sherd dump, partly looted. Another rectangular stone feature might have been constructed on the slope behind Build? ing 48 but the remnants were so sparse that only one point could be plotted. Building 49 (fig. 25). A three- or four-room house. The large central room has an odd double wall on its west side that may be a built-in shelf, a remnant of an earlier wall, or some other architectural feature. The northeast room might have been subdivided into two but the rock fall is not very coherent. The southwest room has its own door, a bench, and perhaps a niche. Two re? taining walls run to Buildings 48 and 51 on either side. Building 50 (fig. 26). The largest of the agglomerated buildings, consisting of four fairly large house units, a courtyard, and six "hooked on" rooms. The large "room" marked by one low wall and no less than four doorways is taken to be a courtyard. The two rooms behind the courtyard are exceptionally large for a house, but they are provided with niches. The well-preserved west niche measures 37 cm wide x 51 high x 39; the damaged east niche is 40 cm wide and ca. 30 deep. A single room has been added outside this unit and would be most accessi- ble to it. The northern house unit consists of three fairly large rooms, two of which are provided with benches, and two "hooked on" rooms. One is quite irregular in shape, and the outermost room, with a blocked door, is actually handier to the two-room house unit just de? scribed. Opening southeast from the courtyard is five- room unit, which has two further outside doors, one looking northeast and one facing the wadi. The apse-like feature and the double thick wall next to it may be relics of some rebuilding operation. The large room, at the south end of Building 50, has a bench and a remnant of a circle of stones, looted, that might have been a hearth. The five-room unit, two added-on rooms with benches, and one more attached room now form, with Building 47, a slightly retired open or working area. In other words, turning in from the wadi street around Building 47 one would find an open area with six doors opening off it, three leading to one-room annexes and three to either Building 47 or Building 50. That the configuration may not be original is indicated by the last three-room unit of Building 50, the one closest to the wadi street. It seems to have been a two-room house "captured" by Building 50; the blocking wall is clearly secondary. This, plus an? other short wall joined to the Building 50 courtyard, gave the unit a third, irregular room. The front room has been looted, and each of the back rooms has a niche.</page><page sequence="77">74 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 Building 51. An agglomeration of two two-room houses plus two attached rooms. Building 51 may origi? nally have been two separate two-room houses. The northern unit is still intact with two niches in the front room measuring (clockwise from the front door) 28 cm wide x 30 high, and 60 cm wide (rest damaged). The second room contains the remains of a bench. The sec? ond two-room house is backed up against the cliff. One room has a bench and possibly a niche; a now-blocked door once connected the two rooms. A short, L-shaped bit of wall together with the east wall of Building 52 now screens the entrance to the back room of Building 51. The narrow entrance space is further littered with sherds and debris. At some time, a short wall was con? structed to link the front and back of Building 51, and two one-room additions were built in the angles between the house units. One added-on room has easy access to the Building 51 and Building 52 area, but the other, with both an interior (looted) and an exterior bench, looks to- wards Building 49. A mortar fragment was found in the doorway of the latter room. Building 52. One-room outbuilding. The back wall is built aeainst the cliff: the west wall has a semicircular bulge in it, and the east wall was built in two segments. The unusually wide door, 1.05 m, suggests a non-domestic use, perhaps shelter for animals. The open area west of Building 52, in the angle behind Building 53, also seems to function with Buildings 51 and 52. But the open area and the slopes behind Buildings 52 and 53 are sherd dumps, partly looted. Building 53. A three-room house. One room, with a bench, is backed up against the cliff and a retaining wall. The two-room section nearer the wadi has remnants of three niches. A short wall segment between the two parts of the house added a little privacy to the entranceway. Building 54. A three-room house. It opens not onto the wadi street but toward the open, sandy area bordered by Buildings 51 and 53. Each room of Building 54 prob? ably had one bench, and one room had one niche, per? haps more. One of the interior doors seems exceptionally wide, but that may be due to wall fall. Building 55 (fig. 26). One-room, rectangular out? building. The looters' hole in the south third of the inte? rior might mark a former bench. Sherds, debris, and ash have been dumped at the foot of the cliff behind Build? ing 55.

The sherd is somewhat similar to a type illus? trated in Mysliwiec 1987: 159, no. 1977 (ca. a.d. 395-640). A few exterior ridges. Orange ware with purple-gray burnished exterior and black burnished interior. 29k Base fragment 291 Jar handle The surface color is 5 Y 7/2. Silt fabric. For a similar base, see the base on a cup of "Aswan pink" ware in Pierrat 1991: 189, fig. 60d (and 60e; both R Ware vessels manufac? tured around Aswan). These examples from Tod, however, appear to date to a later period (from level +75: "vers 1000"; see p. 199). The handle may belong to jar types like those illustrated in Mysliwiec 1987: 164, nos. 2019- 22 and note references in footnotes on p. 163 ("Coptic amphorae" manufactured of Nile silt clay; a.d. 395-640). 29m Ring base Buff ware with green? ish core. 29n Amphora stump base 29o Amphora stump base 29p Painted sherd 29q Painted sherd Reddish-brown Reddish-brown See 29q.

Slope Below Building 33 30f Handmade jar with incised decoration The interior sur? face was brown (7.5 YR 5/2), and the exterior was predomi? nantly red (2.5 YR 4/6) with brown to gray firing discolorations. The fabric had a me? dium amount of chaff temper. No precise parallels are known, although the Sudanese/Nubian tradition is clear in form, fab? ric, and incised decoration. See, for example, the similar (earlier?) handmade jars in Williams 1991: 211 fig. 18c and 376 fig. 214e. Although the two tombs with these examples perhaps date to the last century b.c-first century a.d., this pottery tradition was an enduring one.</page><page sequence="89">86 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 Fig. 30.

Egloff (1977: 102) notes, however, that this cooking pot form scarcely changes from the first and second cen? turies a.d. and later. NOTES 1 The team consisted of Carol Meyer, Field Director; Henry Cowherd, photographer; Lisa Heidorn, archaeolo? gist; Abdel Regal A. Mohammed, Inspector; Mohamed B. E. Omar Mostafa, geologist; and Terence Wilfong, Egyptologist. Omar contributed the section on the geo? logical setting of the site; Wilfong wrote the report on the graffiti; Heidorn prepared the report on the pottery corpus; and all photographs were taken by Cowherd un- less otherwise noted. Thanks are due to Dr. William Sumner, Director of the Oriental Institute which funded the project; to Dr. Peter Dorman, Director of Chicago House which served as our base of operations; to Dr. Mohammed Bakr, Dr. Ahmed Moussa, and Dr. Mu- tawiya Balboush of the Egyptian Antiquities Organiza- tion; to Amira Khattab of ARCE, who saw the project through too many snarls; to Dr. Henri Riad for invalu- able advice; to Dr. Mohammed Sughair, Director of An? tiquities of Southern Egypt; and to Rabia Hamdan and the inspectorates at Qena and Quft. 2The Romans defeated the Blemmyes in a.d. 452 and imposed a hundred years' peace. In a.d. 535 the Blem- myes were again defeated, this time by the Nobades, more or less definitively. 3 The article also has a useful bibliography of previ- ous publications about the Turin Papyrus. 4The squiggle in front of the mainsail may represent a foresail or artemon. The square rigging suggests that the ship is Roman rather than a Medieval lateener. The combination of sails and oars is unusual; merchantmen relied on sail power, and triremes, like the one repre? sented in the Wadi Hammamat (Bernand 1972: pl. 60), relied on oars, with supplementary sail that could easily be dismantled for fighting. There were, however, some merchant galleys; the larger ones might carry an arte? mon, and the oars could be employed for approaching or leaving harbor (Casson 1971: 157, Fig. 140). 5Walter W. Muller, of the Philipps-Universitat in Marburg, replied to an inquiry about the reading of the text that only one word mhmym was clearly legible. In Sabean it means a "field irrigated by a dam-canal," hardly an appropriate word in the middle of a desert, nor is it attested as a proper name. Another possibility is that</page><page sequence="93">90 CAROL MEYER AASOR 52 it is related to an Arabic word for a protected place, per? haps referring to an ancient shrine. In light of the refer? ence to "all the gods in this place" in inscription fig. 7, 11, this is so far the most plausible reading, though it would be more satisfying if more of text were clearer. 6 Figure 7:4 is published as Letronne's number CDXCVII (1848. 452) and fig. 7:11 as CDXC (vol. 2: 448). From Letronne's publication, the graffiti were subse- quently republished in Franz 1853: 4716 d50 and 4716 d45, respectively, and from thence in Bernand 1972, numbers 138 and 134 respectively. None of these editions were made from the original. 7 Some of the long Pharaonic graffiti in the Wadi Hammamat describe the organization and provisioning of quarrying expeditions. They specify water, loaves of bread, meat, cakes, and offerings of wine, beer, incense, and slaughtered cattle (Weigall 1909: 41, 48; Couyat and Montet 1912: 19, 29). 8 Similar amphorae rims are published in Egloff 1977: 109-12 (for dating of various types) and pl. 57:4, 6, and 7 (type 164: beginning of sixth-end of seventh centuries a.d.; type 166: a.d. 450-550; and 167: a.d. 650-730). See also the discussion of the dating and areas of manu- facture of amphora type 164 in Ballet and Picon 1987: 21-26 (the type may have been manufactured from the fourth up to the seventh centuries a.d.). See also, Jacquet- Gordon 1972: pl. 227:P4 (a.d. 600-750 [p. 89]), P5, P8; Mysliwiec 1987: 164, nos. 2019-22; Spencer and Bailey 1982: fig. 5:B17 (with more exterior surface ridges). This type is also found at Hermopolis in contexts dated to the early fifth-seventh centuries a.d. See also the dis? cussion and references on pp. 16-19, and note that a later publication of the remains from this site date the Type B amphorae from Hermopolis to about a.d. 400 and on. Note also the similar amphorae illustrated in Spencer, Bailey, and Burnett 1983: fig. 12:3 (?) (seventh century a.d. or later; see p. 3); Prickett 1979: pl. 85a (QRS-18; Late Roman); and Riley in Sidebotham et al. 1989: 153-54 and fig. 16:13 (buff fabric with creamy ex? terior). Riley notes that this type may have originated in Cyprus or the Antioch region; he dates it to the early fifth-mid-seventh centuries a.d. 9The surface color of the sherd from Building 40 is 10 R 5/6. See fig. 29c and its references. 10The bases from Building 40 measured seven to eight centimeters in diameter.

As in previous seasons, the project has been concerned with testing the sedentarization-nomadization hypothesis. This hypothesis, which grew out of the Heshbon Expedition, has guided investigations of successive cycles of intensification and abatement in settlement and landuse in the project area, which consists of Tell el-Umeiri and the region within 5 km radius of this site, including Tell Jawa and ed-Dreijat. Highlights of the third season's findings include discovery of solid stratigraphic evidence for intensification of settlement at Tell el Umeiri during EBIII; an abatement phase during EBIV; an intensification phase again during MBIIC; followed by an abatement phase during LB. This cyclic pattern continues into the Iron Age, which reaches settlement intensification peaks during Iron I and late Iron II at both Tell el-Umeiri and Tell Jawa. During the Hellenistic period, when settlement activity at these two major tells gradually tapers off, farm? steads such as Rujm Selim and ed-Dreijat continue to thrive. The intensification of landuse which accompanied the build-up of settled life during the late Iron II and Roman periods is reflected in the discoveries of the regional surveys, which docu? mented the existence of numerous farmsteads and intensively managed agricultural valleys dating to these periods. Finally, our research into the uses of caves and for? tified residential compounds during the Ottoman period has begun to shed light on how people coped during times when settled life was precarious in the region. 93</page><page sequence="97">94 LABIANCA AND OTHERS AASOR 52 INTRODUCTION The summer of 1989 marked the 21st anni- versary of archaeological explorations in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan by the Mad- aba Plains Project. As its name suggests, this pro? ject has been concerned with the Madaba Plains, in the highlands east of the northern tip of the Dead Sea. In addition to the town of Madaba, well known for its Byzantine mosaics, the region includes Mount Nebo, Tell Hesban, Umm el-cAmad, el-cAl, and many less well known villages and towns. In the Old Testament, the region is mentioned in con- nection with the Moabites, the Ammonites, and the Israelites. It also contains ruins important to our understanding of the Graeco-Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic centuries in Palestine. The Madaba Plains Project traces its origins to the launching in 1968 of the Heshbon Expedition by S. H. Horn of the Theological Seminary at An- drews University. That expedition's original mis- sion was to excavate Tell Hesban to see what light, if any, it could shed on biblical stories involving the Exodus (Numbers 21, Joshua 13). That the pres? ent site of Tell Hesban had once been the Heshbon mentioned in the Bible in connection with the Is? raelite exodus from Egypt and conquest of Canaan is a claim that most biblical scholars had taken for granted when the project began. Instead of extensive remains from the Old Tes? tament periods, the Tell Hesban excavations pro? duced a prolific quantity of materials from the Graeco-Roman (ca. 200 b.c.e. to c.e. 600) and es? pecially the Ayyubid-Mamluk (ca. c.e. 1200 to 1450) periods. It is to Horn's credit as director of the first three campaigns in 1968, 1971, 1973, as well as to the credit of R. Boraas, the expedition's chief archaeologist during all five campaigns, that these more recent layers were uncovered with the same meticulous care as the older ones. Further- more, both men encouraged the participation of specialists on the dig. This emphasis was signifi? cantly expanded during the last two campaigns in 1974 and 1976, when L. T. Geraty, Horn's succes- sor as professor of archaeology and the history of antiquity at Andrews, took over as director. He also expanded the regional, ethnoarchaeological, and survey aspects of the project. The current research focus of the Madaba Plains Project, namely the concern with sedentarization and nomadization, emerged out of the final synthe? sis of Tell Hesban (cf. LaBianca 1990). Integral to that focus was the food system methodology. It not only supplied a solution to dealing with Tell Hesban as a multiperiod site, it also provided an integrative framework for fitting together the various multi- disciplinary findings of the expedition's specialists. The final outcome of that synthesis was the formula- tion of the "sedentarization-nomadization" hypothe? sis. The hypothesis encompassed the successive cycles of intensification and abatement of the Hes? ban region food system as reflected in the cyclic build-up and desertion of Hesban itself and of the towns, villages, and farmsteads that surrounded it. Equally important, it changed our research design from being primarily tell oriented to being region oriented. Thus considerably more energy was de- voted to regional surveys and excavations of hinter- land sites. A major reason for continuing fieldwork in the Madaba Plains region during the early 1980s was to refine and test our understanding of the sedentariza? tion-nomadization hypothesis. Thus far, three sea? sons of excavation have been completed at Tell el- cUmeiri, a site on the northern fringe of the Madaba Plateau, approximately 10 km northeast of Tell Hes? ban on the southwestern outskirts of Jordan's capi? tal, Amman. In addition to the excavations at this site, the territory within a 5 km radius has been the focus of hinterland excavations and surveys.1 THE SEDENTARIZATION-NOMADIZATION HYPOTHESIS At the risk of oversimplifying historical reality, the sedentarization-nomadization hypothesis is the idea that since the beginnings of settlement on the Madaba Plains there have been periods when the momentum of social change has been in the direction of adopting more sedentary ways; and, conversely, there have been periods when the mo? mentum has been toward adopting more nomadic ways. Over the long term, the result has been an oscillating pattern of human occupation. During times when people were more sedentary, permanent settlements such as farmsteads, vil? lages, and towns sprang up and thrived. They were accompanied by gradual increases in craft special- ization; production of field crops and tree crops; centralization of power, usually involving some type of state apparatus; bureaucratization of pro? duction; stratification of society; and disburse- ment/centralization of the food supply. When people reverted to more nomadic ways, many formerly permanent settlements were de-</page><page sequence="98">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 95 serted and became ruins. As that happened, some people emigrated to other settled areas, while those who remained or had arrived in the wake of the changes survived by maintaining simpler modes of livelihood. Those simpler subsistence strategies involved reliance on animals for accumulation of wealth; annual movements of households between pasture lands and cereal lands; camping in tents, caves, and ruins of farmsteads, villages, and towns; and increased reliance on tribal affiliation for access to lands and protection against hostile states and tribes. A consequence of those dynamic processes was that a spectrum of lifestyles coexisted throughout all periods of human occupation on the Madaba Plains. To varying degrees, such a spectrum has characterized the region as a whole as well as indi? vidual tribal groups, villages, and towns. Thus within a particular tribal group, village, or town, some families' lifestyles were in the vanguard of change whereas other families clung to traditional ways. It is therefore possible that within the same village or town, some families were settled in per- manent houses while others still lived in caves and tents. The same is true for the region as a whole. Parts of it may have been further along in terms of sedentarization or nomadization than others (cf. Glubb 1938). The causes of sedentarization and nomadization are complex and synergistic. On the one hand, in? creased momentum in the direction of sedentariza? tion may result from the introduction of sedentary institutions by a local strongman; imposition of such institutions by a foreign power; new opportu- nities for trade in the form of changes in caravan routes or new roads; and combinations of the above with other factors. Increased momentum in the direction of no? madization, on the other hand, usually follows when sedentary institutions are weakened. That may happen as a result of either political or eco? nomic disruptions or extreme natural events such as droughts, pestilence, and earthquakes. During such times, people either emigrate to other settled areas or stay on and adopt simpler, less conspicu- ous lifestyles to minimize their exposure to preda- tion and loss by capricious foreign administrators, transiting armies, bandits, or hostile tribesmen. To avoid misunderstanding this hypothesis, four clarifications must be added. First, the hypothesis does not assume that when, for example, the mo? mentum of social change is in the direction of sed? entarization, nomadization may not be occurring simultaneously among certain sectors of the popu? lation. It merely holds that the "prevailing" mo- mentum is in one direction or the other. Second, because this hypothesis offers a sim- plified idea of the operation of long-term changes in the Madaba Plains region, it represents at best a first approximation of what actually happened dur? ing particular centuries by examining a wide array of information sources, such as settlement patterns, flora and fauna, land use, and ceramics. The goals of the Madaba Plains Project are to address who and what the agents were that caused sedentariza- tion and nomadization during a given century; the precise manner in which build-up or abandonment of farmsteads, villages, and towns occurred; and the character and spectrum of lifestyles that re? sulted from those happenings. As the details are unearthed through archaeological research, the ways in which the processes were unique or simi? lar from one century to the next will gradually be- come clear. Third, while it may appear that preoccupation with this hypothesis has upstaged the concern with biblical events that provided the spark that brought this project into existence in 1968, that is not the case. The hypothesis is a much more powerful light with which to illuminate not only the biblically rele- vant periods, but also those that preceded and fol- lowed them. Rather than focusing exclusively on the build up and abandonment of farmsteads, villages, and towns on the Madaba Plains during the Late Bronze and Iron Ages, this hypothesis allows us to examine those happenings in relation to similar events during earlier or later periods. In this way, much deeper insight may be gained than is possible when research is narrowly focused on one or an? other specific historical period. METHODOLOGY To the extent that research by the Madaba Plains Project has been concerned with the seden? tarization-nomadization hypothesis, it has contin? ued to be aided by the food system methodology (above). That methodology has supplied assump- tions and procedures for determining the prevail? ing direction of social change during different periods, given the archaeological data produced by this project. Behind the methodology lies three important as- sumptions. The first is that people in the past spent most of their time, in one way or another, devoted</page><page sequence="99">96 LABIANCA AND OTHERS AASOR 52 to the daily tasks of maintaining their food procure- ment arrangements. The second is that, of all the ac- tivities people in the region have pursued over the past five millennia, none was more instrumental in producing the archaeological record than those re? lated to food procurement. A third assumption is that the various activities involved in those arrange? ments are systemically related. That is because, by definition, a food system is a dynamic and complex unity consisting of all the purposive, patterned and interdependent symbolic and instrumental activities carried out by people to procure, process, distribute, store, prepare, consume, metabolize and dispose of food (cf. LaBianca 1990: 9). As was demonstrated in studies of Hesban's food system (Geraty and LaBianca 1985; LaBianca 1990), the extent to which sedentism or nomadism prevailed at a particular time is directly related to how intense the food system was. At Hesban, during times of "low" intensity, transhumant pastoralism prevailed; "medium" intensity indicated that village- based cereal farming prevailed; and "high" intensity meant that urban-oriented intensive farming pre? vailed. By comparing the intensity states of the food system over successive historical periods, the pre- vailing direction of change could be ascertained. Thus when intensification of the food system was occurring sedentarization was also happening, and abatement was accompanied by nomadization. To measure the intensity of the food system during a given historical period, the environmen? tal, settlement, landuse, operational, and dietary conditions were ascertained. Those five archaeo- logically traceable parameters of the food system was the most useful in the analysis of Tell Hesban data. For the current project, a variety of proce- dures for measuring food system intensities were implemented. For example, on Tell el-cUmeiri, L. Herr and his team gave special attention to the cycles of in? tensification and abatement in the intensity of oc? cupation at this site throughout the Bronze and Iron Ages.2 At Tell Jawa and ed-Dreijat, both hin- terland sites, R. Younker and his team were inter- ested in the ways settlement conditions could east light on our understanding of the cUmeiri hinter- land region as a whole.3 On the hinterland survey, 0. LaBianca's teams focused on regional aspects of the ancient food system. For example, long-term changes over time in environmental, settlement, and landuse conditions in the region within 5 km of Tell el-cUmeiri were studied by the random square and the environmental surveys.4 To under- stand the condition of operational facilities on an? cient farmsteads discovered inside the project area the farmstead documentation survey was orga? nized. Operational facilities include those used for sheltering people and animals, for processing or storing food, for collecting and storing water, and so on.5 The objectives of the seasonal site survey were similar, namely to learn more about the operational conditions that prevailed when people were living in tents and caves.6 The objective of this team, whose work was mostly experimental, was to determine the feasibility of using ground- penetrating radar in locating sub-surface archaeo? logical features. To these field operations we added those of the project's laboratories. The ce? ramic technology lab, headed by G. London, had the following goals: documentation of the manu- facturing techniques for each archaeological period and changes or continuity from one period to an? other; characterization of the raw materials used for bricks and vessels of specific types, e.g., cook? ing pots, bowls, juglets, jugs, and jars, in each period; comparison of pottery excavated at each of the project's major sites through petrographic analysis (over 200 samples were selected); docu? mentation of long-distance trade in pottery and its contents, as well as trade on a more localized level among the different geographic and social units; and recording of marks of manufacture and owner- ship to learn about those who made and used the wares.7 THE EXCAVATIONS AT TELL EL-CUMEIRI Excavations at Tell el-cUmeiri took place in six Fields (figs. 1, 2) and discovered remains from Early Bronze Age III (ca. 2500 b.ce.) to early Per? sian (ca. 500 b.ce.). Early Bronze Age at Tell el-cUmeiri The earliest stratified remains found, as in pre? vious seasons, were dated to the Early Bronze Age. Occupational remains were uncovered on both the southern and northern shelves, confirming once again that during that period Tell el-cUmeiri reached its greatest extent. While only fragmentary evidence was found on the northern slope, the most extensive remains came from the southern shelf, where two broad terraces and a street system organized blocks of domestic dwellings. Two long retaining walls provided support for the two ter-</page><page sequence="100">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 97 G H ' J K ' L M Fig. 1.

Parts of the lower, southern terrace (the southern half of Field D in fig. 1) were first exca? vated in 1984 (Geraty 1985: 95), while the upper, northern terrace (the northern half of Field D in fig. 1) was excavated in 1987 (Geraty, Herr, and LaBianca 1988: 241). The 1989 season marked a return to the same grid of squares first opened in 1984 and the completion of the task of uncovering the structures on the lower, southern terrace. The most coherent remains of the EB III settle? ment have so far come from the lower terrace. A street, approximately 1.5 m wide, ran north to south through the excavated area, bisecting it into two separate housing units (figs. 3, 4). A line of stones along the eastern side of the street was pos? sibly intended to hold fodder for a tethered beast of burden. At its northern end, the street apparently turned east, running along the retaining wall of the northern terrace.</page><page sequence="101">98 LABIANCA AND OTHERS AASOR 52 Fig. 2. Aerial view of Tell el-cUmeiri from the east. Neither of the two housing units was completely exposed. Although excavations unearthed little more than one room from the compound west of the street, the unit to the east produced three rooms with significant remains. One room, 3.5 x 3.5 m, bounded on the west and north by the street, con? tained two "L"-shaped bins and a cobbled surface, suggesting that it served as a courtyard, perhaps for sheltering animals. The room opened onto the northern portion of the street. A stepped doorway to the east connected the courtyard to a large storeroom that contained the remains of some 28 storage vessels of various types, mostly jars (fig. 5). Protected by the destruc? tion debris from the superstructure that fell on top of the vessels, and preserved by the fire that rav- aged the building, many of the vessels still con? tained carbonized seeds. They included legumes (lentils and garbanzos), fruits (grapes and fig), and grains (wheat and barley). In addition, a small juglet was found that may have contained oil. A bench with an inset hearth was uncovered in a small room south of the courtyard. It had been constructed against the courtyard's southern wall, and lends further evidence of the domestic nature of the compound. The pottery on the surfaces of the rooms, present at their destruction, was EB III. Below this EB III domestic complex, the tops of several walls from yet an earlier settlement began to emerge toward the end of the season. Although the founding levels of the emerging walls were not reached, a few EB I-II sherds were found, as well as one possible Chalcolithic sherd. On the northern slope, in Field G, two squares were excavated on the eastern line of a " V"-shaped topographic feature descending the slope toward the water source (fig. 1; see also Geraty 1985: 94). Although those topographic features strongly sug? gested that walls lay below, the excavations un? covered nothing but 3 m of unstratified dump above EB III tumble. No sign of a wall could be found, even when a backhoe sectioned the line. However, the presence of EB III material confirms that the town extended far down the northern slope of the tell during that period. The Early Bronze Age in Palestine, known as the age of urbanization, witnessed the development of large, often walled, sedentary sites. The Early</page><page sequence="102">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 99 Fig. 3. EB el-cUmeiri. street in Field D, Tell Bronze settlement at Tell el-cUmeiri appears to represent a modest expression of that process. The remains that have been found indicate both inten- sive and extensive settlement activity during EB III. While a shift toward sedentarization may have already begun as early as the Chalcolithic pe? riod, it undoubtedly did not reach its peak until EB III. Although the earlier periods still await full excavation, what has been uncovered so far does not reflect the same intensity of settlement that the EB III remains portray. Since no trace of a city wall, or any other such defensive structure, has been discovered at Tell el- cUmeiri, that feature, traditionally used to define the "urban" character of a site, cannot be used to measure the level of organization achieved at the site. Indeed, it could be argued that the lack of any fortification wall should be interpreted to mean that the settlement never became an urban center at all. However, such reasoning ignores the well- planned nature of the settlement, and the fact that the site reached its largest extent ever?approxi? mately 16 acres?during the EB period. The ar- rangement and layout of EB III Tel el-cUmeiri suggests an orderly and efficient use of space and indicates that a reasonably high level of social or? ganization had already been achieved. The Early Bronze finds from the 1989 season, along with those of the two previous seasons, have helped to further confirm the sedentarization- nomadization working hypothesis that has been adopted by the project. As has been suggested, EB III marked the culmination of a gradual process of settlement intensification. The extensive occu- Fig. 4. Sketch plan of EB III remains in Field D, Tell el- cUmeiri. pation remains on the tell, therefore, reflect a shift toward the exploitation of sedentary subsistence strategies. After the EB III high point, the settlement his? tory shows signs of abatement over the succeeding two strata (probably EB IV). In the level immedi? ately above the well-planned EB III domestic com- plexes in Field D, two semicircular dwellings were</page><page sequence="103">100 LABIANCA AND OTHERS AASOR 52 Fig. 5.

Those dwellings were approximately 4 m wide and are similar to early EB IV structures found at Tell Um-Hammad in the Jordan Valley (Helms 1989: #29). This settlement pattern may reflect the sea- sonal activity typical of a predominantly nomadic way of life. Somewhat later, but probably still during the early EB IV, a complex of long, thin, walls of small boulders and thick mud mortar may have been used as animal pens by seminomadic pasto- ralists. It is therefore possible to trace a gradual shift away from the intense EB III settlement pat? tern typical of an "urban" or sedentary existence, toward a more nomadic settlement configuration. Following the last occupation, the site apparently was abandoned around 2200 or 2100 b.c.e. While the past three seasons have helped to confirm the general shift between sedentarization and nomadi? zation in the Early Bronze Age, further excavation and more precise documentation of each of the stages is still needed to reach a full understanding of the cultural processes. Middle Bronze Age A new settlement seems to have begun toward the end of the Middle Bronze Age. No pottery that can be securely dated to MB IIA has been found; and while a few chocolate-on-white sherds were found in the earliest layers, many more were found in later Middle Bronze layers. Indeed, chocolate-on- white ware is ubiquitous, occurring together with</page><page sequence="104">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 101 r~i f Fig. 7. Sketch section of the Iron I fortifications in Field B, Tell el-cUmeiri: 1?inner casemate wall; 2?outer casemate wall; 3?casemate room; 4?Iron I rampart; 5?Iron I retaining wall; 6?moat; and 7?MB II rampart. flat-bottomed cooking pots and profiled-rim jars. The date of the resettlement should thus be within MB IIC. The new settlers abandoned the southern shelf and did not achieve the intensity of occupation on the northern slope and eastern shelf that occurred in EB III. However, excavations in Field B on the western slope of the acropolis have probed ca. 1 m into an earthen rampart (fig. 6), suggesting that the Middle Bronze settlement was the first to be for? tified at cUmeiri. However, a full-blown urban center did not spring up with the arrival of the new settlers. At best the first settlement started with an unfortified village or town. This is indicated by the fact that the rampart layers included earlier Middle Bronze sherds (ca. 10 percent), suggesting an ear? lier settlement before the rampart was built. The top layer of the rampart (no other layers have been found yet) sloped ca. 30 degrees and was made of beaten earth with a few short, thin lenses of crushed lime. So far, nothing has been found of the city wall associated with the rampart. The presence of the rampart suggests that the walled, urban center at cUmeiri was not appreciably different from cities elsewhere in Syro/Palestine, although it was rela? tively small, covering only the acropolis (ca. 6 acres). The relatively late date of its founding, as well as the presence of strong fortifications around so small a site, suggest that the area was a frontier. Indeed, virtually no other remains have been found from the same period in the region. How could an isolated settlement like cUmeiri prosper enough to intensify economically and so- cially? One answer is trade. Although clean Middle Bronze layers have been rare at cUmeiri so far (but Middle Bronze pottery is frequent in later, mixed deposits), there are significant signs of far-flung trade. An obsidian fragment found in a Middle Bronze layer in 1987 probably came from Anatolia, while a fragment of Tell el-Yahudiyeh ware sug? gests trade with Western Palestine or Syria. Late Bronze Age The isolated Middle Bronze intensification pro? cess at cUmeiri was a prelude to the Late Bronze settlement. Debris layers from the Late Bronze Age were uncovered behind an extraurban, Iron I terrace wall in Field F, the eastern shelf. Although no architectural remains were isolated, the layers produced a Cypriot Base-Ring sherd and a well- preserved Astarte fertility plaque common to the period (fig. 6). The pottery appears to be consider- ably advanced over that from the Middle Bronze settlement, probably LB IIB. It would seem that the Late Bronze settlement reused the Middle Bronze fortifications and did not grow outside the walls. The intensification process visible at the end of the Middle Bronze Age thus did not continue. In fact, the degenerate Late Bronze pottery suggests that at least a technical abatement had occurred.</page><page sequence="105">102 LABIANCA AND OTHERS AASOR 52 Fig. 8. Iron I outer casemate wall with rampart in Field B, Tell el- &gt; cUmeiri. S* v.'v -v'!V^ Fig. 9. Iron I collared-rim jars in casemate room, Tell el-cUmeiri. Iron Age I In the 1989 season it became clear that the case? mate fortification system discovered in previous seasons in Field B was indeed from Iron Age I, as suggested in earlier reports (Geraty 1985: 92; Ger? aty, Herr, and LaBianca 1988: 236), (figs. 6, 8). An earthen rampart, almost 2 m thick and sloping 32- 35 degrees, was constructed immediately on top of the Middle Bronze rampart. That the rampart was constructed at the same time as the outer casemate wall, against which it lay, was suggested by the fact that the upper two layers within the rampart correspond to courses in the wall (see illustration in Clark 1991: 56-57). It thus appears that the rampart was constructed to provide support for the wall against the weight of debris inside. All three layers of the rampart produced significant quanti? ties of Iron I pottery. At the bottom, a revetment wall supported the rampart where a dry moat plunged ca. 4 cm into bedrock. The rock and clay excavated from the moat appeared to have been used for the founding layer of the rampart, sug- gesting contemporary construction. Inside the casemate room and further inside the town was a deep destruction layer ca. 1.8 m thick. It was composed primarily of burned mudbricks and stones but also included burned wooden roofing beams. The fire was so hot that it turned some of the wall stones to lime. Beneath the destruction debris</page><page sequence="106">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 103 t 10 LGH JL Fig. 10.

Many species of carbonized seeds were found in those storage pithoi. Several of these large vessels contained identical potter's marks on the handles, but none had precisely the same type of collar as any of the others. This destruction heralded the end of Iron I in Field B. In earlier seasons, we uncovered remains of an early Iron II storeroom over this destruction (Geraty 1985: 93). In Fields A and F an ash layer</page><page sequence="108">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 105 Fig. 12. Late Iron ll/early Persian buildings in Field A, Tell el-cUmeiri. overlay the stratigraphic boundary between Iron I and late Iron II (with no early Iron II between). It thus appears that the destruction that ended Iron I at Tell el-cUmeiri was sitewide. All Iron I pottery at cUmeiri was Iron IA, or 12th century b.c.e. In Field F, on the eastern shelf, a well-built terrace wall came from that period, although no occupa? tional surfaces were found. Excavation did not proceed into the Iron I layers in Field A. The Iron I period represents a significant inten? sification of occupation at cUmeiri, a development that reflects a region-wide escalation of the seden? tarization process. Villages and towns are more fre? quent, while cities gradually develop. The earliest Iron I settlement probably reused the old Middle Bronze fortifications, as the Late Bronze inhabi? tants had done. But as their economic and social system developed, they could affbrd a massive re- fortification effort. Such a development is incom- prehensible without significant growth in prosperity and population. Early Iron Age II The prosperity of the Iron I settlement appears to have ended when the city was destroyed, proba? bly within the 12th century. Subsequent early Iron II remains were poorly built and have been found only in Field B. Reoccupation was small and not very successful. Nearby Tell Jawa shows signs of producing more significant early Iron II remains, but the regional survey may also reflect a slightly abated settlement pattern in early Iron II. B Fig. 13.

Four new squares were opened in a north-south line immediately east of the previously excavated area. After three seasons it now seems that three large buildings have been exposed. Only two or three rooms of a large building with very thick walls have been found in the south (Lawlor 1991), but the central building has been completely exposed. It comprised four rooms, three long rooms abutting a broad room (figs. 12, 13), a house-style typical in western Palestine and often thought to be "Israelite," but now becoming more frequent in Transjordan as Iron Age sites are excavated. The third building on the north was ori? ented at 90 degrees to the four-room house and in? cluded a broad room with at least five long rooms abutting it. One of the rooms was formed with a row of pillars, doorways connected all the rooms. At least the first two buildings were apparently basement structures; that is, the walls were built into a large pit dug for the whole structure. Individ? ual foundation trenches were not found for any of the walls, and immediately outside the buildings Iron I layers were found. Surfaces were uncovered only in the northern building, where a typical do? mestic repertoire of objects, such as grinding tools, was found. However, the thick walls, the basements, and the large size of the two southern buildings suggest they were used for nondomestic, adminis? trative activities. Perhaps they should be connected with the royal seal found in the area in 1984 (Ger? aty, et al. 1986: 138), as well as two Persian provin? cial seal impressions found in the 1989 season. Other major structures from the same period were found in Field F on the eastern shelf. Three parallels walls (figs. 14, 15) may have formed a small gate structure with a narrow passageway be? tween the two eastern walls. Inside this possible gate was a large building constructed of the west-</page><page sequence="110">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 107 Fig. 16. Figurine head from Tell el-cUmeiri. ern parallel wall; this latter wall had corners at both ends with walls extending westward out of the excavated area. Associated surfaces contained no objects. The late Iron II phases represent another sub- period of intensification in the settlement. The large buildings seem to have covered the acropolis, whereas the early Iron II structures were smaller and fewer. However, security does not seem to have been a grave problem. The city wall appar? ently was still the Iron I outer casemate wall with a few patches in the rampart. The small, ephemeral "gate" in Field F fits this lack of felt security needs. Also, most of the buildings discovered were very large, suggesting administrative functions in- stead of domestic. Indeed, according to G. London, our ceramic technologist, the lack of a large vari? ety of ownership marks on the pottery indicates that the population at the site was small. Else? where, London has called attention to indications that much of the Iron II population of Palestine lived outside the walled cities (London 1989). The large numbers of hinterland agricultural complexes in the region surrounding Tell el-cUmeiri support that suggestion. The many finds from Field A included several figurines (fig. 16). It is thus likely that the sedenta? rization process in late Iron II was a product of in? creased security in the region, perhaps due to the presence of the Assyrians. Their strong control of the territory may have resulted in a pax assyriaca, which would have allowed a modest expression of prosperity. The three buildings in Field A continued into the early Persian period with no apparent break. The typical corpus of late Iron II pottery continued with a few Persian additions, such as Attic ware. Two inscribed seal impressions with Aramaic writing of ca. 500 b.c, occurred on jar handles (figs. 17, 18). They contained the name of the Persian province, cmn ("cAmmon"), and the hypocoristicon of a pro? vincial official, sbD ("ShubaD"). The impressions were made by two seals, emphasizing their official function. A third seal impression was incomplete. It was pressed into the rim of a Persian-period jar and contained the name of an individual. Later Persian phases suggest a marked decline in quality. Poorer structures were built over the buildings of Field A described above (figs. 12, 13), seemingly ignoring the earlier walls completely. Similar building fragments have been uncovered in Field B. Unfortunately, the surfaces that went with those walls have been destroyed by agricultural ac? tivities on top of the mound in the Middle Ages, but the latest pottery associated with them in fill layers was Persian. This new phase represents the nomadization process during the Persian period. Perhaps the ad? ministrative institutions of society had broken down, and there was no longer a need for large administrative buildings. Without central political and social control, the economic system also broke</page><page sequence="111">108 LABIANCA AND OTHERS AASOR 52 Fig. 17. Seal impression of the Persian province of Am- mon from Field A, Tell el-cUmeiri. down; and, though inhabitants attempted to retain their lifestyle by building (inferior) houses on the acropolis, their attempt did not last long. There were no remains that would suggest a settlement at the site beyond the fifth century b.c. Early Roman Period In 1987 a small plastered pool or ritual bath with steps was excavated at the northern edge of Field A (Geraty, Herr, and LaBianca 1988: 234). Pottery no later than the early Persian period came from the debris inside. In the 1989 season, when we removed part of the foundation of the structure, we found two early Roman sherds. It would thus appear that the pool should be redated to the early Roman period. However, no evidence at the site suggests occupation from that period. Small amounts of pottery were found in the 1984 random surface survey, but not enough to suggest a signifi? cant occupation. Roman utilization of the site and spring instead occurred at Tell el-cUmeiri East, across the modern highway. Middle Ages Because the plastered pool must have been sub- terranean, but no associated buildings or pottery of the Roman period have been found anywhere in the immediate area as might be expected, we sug? gest that any associated Roman buildings have dis? appeared and that the present surface of the mound has eroded considerably since Roman times. Agri? cultural activity, combined with accompanying wind erosion, has lowered the top of the tell by as much as a meter. The wind removed the soil but Fig. 18. A second seal impression of the Persian province of Ammon from Field A, Tell el-cUmeiri. left stones, pottery, and objects. As the surface of the mound eroded, farmers piled newly-exposed stones in many large mounds, scattered over the site. Water Source Excavations continued in one square in Field E, the water source at the bottom of the tell on the north side. Earth layers from Iron I were cut by a plaster and cobble installation built during Iron II times (fig. 19). The Iron II remains were, in turn, cut by an early Roman plastered channel. Then, during Byzantine times, all structures were cut by a deep foundation pit for a tunnel leading to the present well house. The Byzantine structure was used when the well was capped in the 1930s. None of the ancient remains except the Byzantine one were coherent enough to reconstruct the water structures. Seal and Seal Impressions A seal inscribed on two sides was discovered in the topsoil of Field A (Object No. 1749) (fig. 20). The name of the owner, DlDms, occurred on the top with a drawing of a bull's or ram's head. On the bot? tom was a bird perched atop a possible lotus flower, while the name of the owner and his patronym were inscribed around the iconography: PPms bn tmk?l. We can translate and vocalize the inscription "Be? longing to ^EPamats son of TamakDel." Both names are found on other Ammonite seals and inscriptions. The letters suggest an early seventh century b.ce. date, but none of the forms are strongly diagnostic. The discovery of this seal, an emblem of power and</page><page sequence="112">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 109 * Fig. 19. Excavations at the water i? source, Tell el-cUmeiri. prestige, makes sense in terms of intensification of settlement and landuse and also in terms of the bu- reaucratization of production that no doubt pre? vailed during the period. HINTERLAND EXCAVATIONS AT TELL JAWA During the 1987 season the survey team discov? ered that parts of Tell Jawa, a large, important site ca. 5 km east of cUmeiri, had been recently bull? dozed, apparently in preparation for a new housing development. Surface sherding indicated periods of occupation that overlapped with cUmeiri, espe? cially during the Iron II period. Obtaining an accu- rate understanding of cUmeiri's role in the region requires taking into account its relationship with Jawa. While the core staff had discussed the need eventually to conduct a probe of Jawa, the immedi- ate threat to the site forced us to act more quickly than we had planned. Therefore, in the 1989 sea? son a small team was assigned to open five squares on the south side of the tell where the bulldozer had stopped after exposing the outer face of what appeared to be an Iron Age city wall (fig. 21). The five squares, opened in Field A?Squares 1, 2, 3, and 4 south to north, and Square 13 east of Square 3 (fig. 22)?transected three major parallel wall lines, including the outermost one, which had stopped the bulldozer. The strategy was to expose those walls, determined their construction history and function (they appeared to be city walls), and explore remains of occupation inside the walls. ??*\M%'tf&amp;&amp;&amp;ik$mJ&amp; Fig. 20. Seal from Field A, Tell el-cUmeiri. Early Iron Age II The excavations revealed at least nine archaeo? logical phases, mostly dating from the Iron II pe? riod. The earliest phase, exposed in Square 13, consisted of the intersection of two Iron Age stone walls. Both walls were covered with large (65 x 35 x 15 cm) fallen mudbricks, apparently from the col- lapsed superstructure. Because the bases of the walls were not reached, their date and function re? main uncertain. However, the debris of the col- lapsed walls contained late Iron I?/early Iron II sherds, making it probable that the walls were con? structed either during that period (tenth-ninth cen? turies b.c.e.) or later in Iron II. A fill west of the walls produced Middle Bronze, Late Bronze, and Iron I sherds. A small ash pocket south of the debris</page><page sequence="113">110 LABIANCA AND OTHERS AASOR 52 Fig. 21. Bulldozed wall at Jawa. Fig. 22. Sketch plan of Field A, Jawa. from the two Iron Age walls apparently reflects an extensive occupation in association with those walls (Phase 9B). At least five subsequent Iron Age phases (Phases 8-4) were found in Squares 3, 4, and 13 just inside the city wall. They were particularly evident in Square 3, where two wall lines appeared to define two rectangular rooms of a large house. The lower portions of those walls were constructed of stone while the upper parts were mudbrick. On the surface associated with the lowest floor (Phase 8) was a collection of food preparation objects and ceramic vessels of a domestic nature. The objects included a saddle quern, an upper millstone (both broken, but in situ), two pounding stones, and fragments of an oven that apparently was against one of the walls. Numerous bones (55 sheep/goat, 2 cattle), ash, and flint fragments were also found on the surface. The pottery on the floor was from early Iron II (ninth-eighth centuries b.ce.) Middle Iron Age II Later, probably during the middle of the Iron II period (eighth-seventh centuries b.ce.), the floor of the room was resurfaced (Phase 7). Cooking pots, numerous animal bones (161 sheep/goat, 10 cattle), an upper millstone, and a stone pounder testify to its continued food preparation function. A broken spindle whorl might suggest spinning ac? tivity at the site. A probable contemporary phase was found in the room immediately to the east. The latest surface in the western room (Phase 6) also had cooking pots, ash, small bowls, and ani-</page><page sequence="114">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 111 mal bones (32 sheep/goat and 2 cattle). Large amounts of white plaster, possibly the result of re? building the inner casemate wall, had accumulated on the surface. Again, the room immediately to the east seemed to have a contemporary phase. It, too, contained remains of domestic activities, including an accumulation of charcoal, bones (57 sheep/goat, 9 cattle, 1 chicken), 2 spindle whorls, a broken stone grinder, a stone pounder, and a polished, finely serrated shark's tooth. To the north of those two rooms was a rather large building (Phase 5) with at least two long rooms. Pottery found in the debris layers of the building suggests that it was subsequent to the rooms discussed in the proceeding paragraph (Iron II?8th?7th centuries b.c.e.). One of the season's most interesting finds, the head of a small figurine, came from the eastern wall of this large building (fig. 23). It depicts a male wearing a headdress similar to the Egyptian atef crown and identical to those depicted on the well-known limestone busts displayed in the Am? man Museum. S. Horn (personal communication) has suggested that the headdress was the crown of the Ammonite king. If that suggestion is accurate, this artifact would suggest that Jawa, which is near the border of Moab, was within the Ammonite sphere during the Middle Iron II period. That sug? gestion is further supported by the pottery, which is stylistically identical to that of nearby cUmeiri where a number of distinctive Ammonite inscrip? tions have already been found. If Jawa is indeed an Ammonite city, Alt's (1932) identification of Jawa with biblical Mephacath would have to be modi? fied, since the latter clearly is a Moabite town (Jeremiah48:21-24).8 Late Iron Age II Excavations indicated that during the latter part of the Iron II period (ca. seventh century b.c.e.?) the city walls were rebuilt (Phase 5), although fur? ther excavation is needed to clarify their relation? ship to the domestic architecture found just inside. The city walls underwent further reconstruction (Phase 4) a short time later (late seventh, early sixth centuries b.c.e.). The city walls of that phase appear to be constructed in the casemate style. A doorway leads from one of the casemate rooms into the city. An ash layer seems to represent a cooking area just inside the city wall, although there were few bones. Pottery was late Iron II (sixth century b.c.e.), although that cooking area Fig. 23. Figurine of Ammonite King, Jawa. could have existed subsequent to the abandonment of the town. The Iron Age occupation at Jawa apparently was terminated during the sixth century b.ce. Evidence for destruction or abandonment include the rock tumble that extended south down the slope from the city walls. In association with the rock tumble were the upper courses of the exterior portion of the case? mate wall, which was slumped inward (uphill). Ini- tially it was thought that the slumping should be attributed to an earthquake. However, the presence of 13 javelin points against the outside of the wall suggests that the collapse could be related to an at? tack on the town. The clearest sign of the destruc? tion inside the walls was a large amount of pottery smashed against a wall and its associated floor. That pottery, all late Iron II (ca. sixth century b.ce.), in? cluded pithoi, store jars, jugs, and one complete juglet. Amid the debris were two more javelin points, identical in style to those found outside the city wall. It is possible, although far from certain, that this destruction is related to Nebuchadnezzar's</page><page sequence="115">112 LABIANCA AND OTHERS AASOR 52 Fig. 24. Dreijat. Megalithic structure, ed- 582/581 b.ce. punitive campaign against the Am- monites and Moabites noted by Josephus. After the destruction the western part of Tell Jawa was not reoccupied. The final two archaeo? logical phases in Field A consisted of topsoils and modern field walls. Some Roman/Byzantine sherds were found, but there was no sign that this part of the tell was occupied in those periods. HINTERLAND EXCAVATIONS AT ED-DREIJAT A previous report of the Madaba Plains Project mentioned a large "megalithic" structure, recorded by the regional survey, which was described as a "fort" in the sense of the biblical biraniyot. Because of the extensive discussion concerning the date and precise function of similar so-called "Ammonite towers," we decided to excavate this one (fig. 24). The site, presently known as ed-Dreijat ("the stairs"), is located on a high hill approximately 2.8 km southwest of Tell el-cUmeiri. First iden? tified by Fohrer as Site D, it was later included by the Hesban Survey as Site 135. Prior to excavation, a site survey by the excava? tion team identified what appeared to be exterior walls approximately 2.5 m wide, as well as two interior walls of similar thickness. Immediately southeast of the site, a large open cave was iden? tified. According to local villagers, a certain Umm Yusef uses the cave during the winter months as a sheep/goat pen. Farther south, on the crest of the hill, was a bell-shaped cistern, approximately 15.5 m deep, which at the time of the excavation con- tained 4 m to 4.5 m of water. It is still used by shepherds in the region throughout the summer. All exterior walls were built of massive unhewn or partially hewn chert boulders (ranging from 1.1 m to 2 m in diameter) and filled with chink stones. Two major east-west interior walls were joined to the western exterior wall. The interior walls appear to have extended across and joined the north-south wall on the eastern side. It is pos? sible that major interior walls such as these sup? ported a second story. The complex was further subdivided into small rooms by numerous minor interior walls (fig. 25). Excavations revealed a much more complex use of the site than we had first anticipated. It appears that there were at least seven phases of occupation or activity. Iron Age II Although no surfaces or architectural remains could be dated definitely to Iron Age II, the pres? ence of several Iron II surface sherds, as well as pockets of late Iron II, suggests that the site was initially occupied during that period (Phase 7). The similarity of construction with other Iron Age buildings in the region also supports the possibility that at least part of the ed-Dreijat structure (proba? bly the main rectangular part) was built originally during that time. It appears, however, that the site was cleared to bedrock during the later Persian/ Hellenistic occupation, making a precise dating for the initial construction of the fort difficult (see be? low). Two cisterns or storage tanks were probably cut during this earliest phase of occupation.</page><page sequence="116">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 113 11.5?? Fig. 25. Plan of ed-Dreijat. Late Persian and Early Hellenistic Periods The next activity phase (Phase 6) seems to have involved some remodeling during the late Persian? or early Hellenistic period. Pottery from that pe? riod was found not only in all 11 squares, but also on several bedrock surfaces, indicating that the Persian or Hellenistic occupants cleared the site down to bedrock in most areas (fig. 26). It was probably during that period that the Iron II pottery of earlier inhabitants was dumped into an aban- doned cave or cistern. Several inner walls probably were constructed during the same period to create rooms along the west side of the complex (fig. 27). Several other rooms in the northeast corner of the site were also added. Hellenistic Period While there is no clear break between Phases 6 and 5, several Hellenistic lamps, cooking pots, and other late Hellenistic forms provide clear evidence for a later Hellenistic occupation. A circular instal? lation, possibly used for storage, may have been constructed at that time. Roman, Byzantine, and Ayyubid/Mamluk Periods There is some evidence for Roman activity (Phase 4), although it does not appear that much of the structure was utilized. The circular installation may have continued in use.</page><page sequence="117">114 LABIANCA AND OTHERS AASOR 52 A Byzantine presence is suggested by sherds, but all are small and worn. One of two coins found at the site comes from this period. It was a coin of Constans or Constantine (fourth century c.e.). The other coin has not been identified. From the small number of sherds, 14 in all, it is possible that a temporary encampment occupied the site during the Ayyubid/Mamluk period. All the sherds are painted and may have come from the same vessel. Modern Period The most recent phase of activity on the site ap? pears to be the result of modern Bedouin, accord? ing to the ceramic evidence. Portions of a modern water jar were also uncovered. Most of the modern occupation, however, appeared to be centered around the cave in the southeastern corner of the site and the blocked cave entrance to the west that was not excavated this season. THE HINTERLAND SURVEYS During the last three seasons, the survey's scope has shifted from extensive coverage of the entire project area to intensive scrutiny of selected sites or regions within the area. Thus the emphasis during the 1984 and 1987 seasons was on exploration and mapping of new sites and on the dominant envi? ronmental, settlement, and landuse conditions. By contrast, the 1989 season emphasized in-depth ex? amination and documentation of aspects of the food system that, although discovered for the most part during the two prior seasons, were deemed worthy of more intensive investigation. Each of the five teams who comprised the 1989 survey had its own objectives, procedures, and staffs. These included the subsurface mapping team, the random square team, the environmental team, the farmstead docu? mentation team, and the ethnoarchaeological team. Subsurface Mapping The objective of the subsurface mapping team, made up of three physicists whose work was mostly experimental, was to determine the feasibil- ity of using ground-penetrating radar to locate sub? surface archaeological features. More will be said about this in later reports. Fig. 26. Persian/Hellenistic pottery, ed-Dreijat. The Random Square Survey In the 1989 season the random survey added 40 squares, each 200m2 to the 60 that had been com? pleted during the previous two seasons of field? work. The 100 squares are approximately 5 percent of the 1,969 such squares within a 5 km radius of Tell el-cUmeiri. Already this survey has height- ened awareness of several important dynamics of settlement and landuse within the project area. The most significant finding, perhaps, is the discovery that pottery from the Roman and Byzantine periods and, to a lesser extent, the Iron Age is ubiquitous throughout the project area. That finding lends support to the impression, arrived at through exca? vations and survey at Tell Hesban, that during those three periods the food system reached peaks of intensity not equalled at any other time in his? tory until now. As in previous seasons, the random square sur? vey contributed to the discovery of new archaeo? logical sites. In the 1989 season a total of 25 new sites was recorded, including several with concen- trations of agricultural features. The rapid pace at which modern construction is obliterating the ar? chaeological record was especially obvious to the random square team, since a number of the squares selected for survey were found to be completely covered by new housing and streets. Also encoun? tered almost daily by that team, because of its ex? tensive coverage of the project area, were the number of new fences erected over the past two years. Typically, the fences enclose newly planted orchards or drip-irrigated vegetable fields. These are another sign of the rapid pace of sedentariza- tion and food system intensification.</page><page sequence="118">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 115 Fig. 27. Excavated rooms, ed- Dreijat. Fig. 28. Wadi el-Bisharat. The Environmental Survey The environmental survey team specifically ex? amined the landuse strategies that prevailed during the high intensity Roman and Byzantine periods. The site chosen for this in-depth examination, Wadi el-Bisharat, is approximately 2 km due west of Tell el-cUmeiri (fig. 28). Adjacent to a large Ro- man/Byzantine town (Site 57) and a winery/church (Site 6), yet small enough to study as a complete system, it was deemed the best candidate for studying the interaction between people and envi? ronment during those high-intensity periods. Sev? eral features were mapped, photographed, and sherded by the team, including a series of various intact embankments that ran perpendicular to the fertile wadi bottom; sections of ancient terraces as? cending from the wadi floor to the north and south; and diversion dams and embankments constructed along several smaller tributary wadis. On the basis of pottery sherds found in and around those structures, a comparison could be made between present-day and Roman/Byzantine utilization of the wadi. The comparison suggests that when the ancient system was at its peak, the wadi and its surrounding slopes could have pro? duced perhaps ten-fold its modern production in vegetable and fruit crops. The fact that terraces are again being constructed along the slopes of the wadi and repairs are beginning to be made to the</page><page sequence="119">116 LABIANCA AND OTHERS AASOR 52 embankments along its floor is confirmation that the prevailing momentum today is the direction of intensification and sedentarization. The Farmstead Documentation Survey The farmstead documentation team mapped, photographed, and drew features of complexes that were identified as ancient farmsteads. The sites se? lected for documentation represented good exam? ples of large agricultural estates, smaller farmsteads, and agricultural camp sites (Younker 1991). While the first two types usually included clusters of build? ings and agricultural installations, the third was typically represented only by a small watchtower. A total of 14 sites belonging to these categories, mostly occupied both in the Iron Age and Roman/ Byzantine time, was documented. One site, Rujm Selim (excavated in 1987), was also occupied dur? ing late Hellenistic times. sedentary continuum of households whose lifestyles could be followed by others. By means of such arrangements individual house? holds could adjust to shifting economic and politi- cal winds. For example, throughout much of the Ottoman period (ca. 1500-1900 c.e.) the majority of Ajarmeh households avoided settling in con- spicuous stonehouses where they would be sitting prey for Ottoman tax authorities and hostile tribes- men. Instead they opted to live "inconspicuously" in seasonally occupied cave villages, most of them located on ancient tells. From there they could still carry on with their wheat growing in the winter months while being able to quickly disappear if the need should arise. Thus they were able to mini- mize their exposure to loss due to predation of various kinds while maintaining their mixed agro- pastoral food production strategy. The Ethnoarchaeological Survey The primary objective of the ethnoarchaeological team was to ascertain how sedentarization and no? madization take place at the level of the tribal group and the local village. Interviews were carried out among three groups of local residents: Ajarmeh tribesmen who had occupied the region for several centuries, Christian families present since the last century, and Palestinian families, present only since the past three or four decades. In carrying out this work, the team was assisted by two artists and an in- terpreter. The artists helped to elicit information about how caves were utilized by the Ajarmeh ear? lier in the present century and before. Perhaps the most important insights gained from the interviews have to do with advancing our understanding of why and how single households and groups of families could convert back and forth along the nomadic-sedentary continuum. Structural arrangements that have traditionally made such movement possible include: the prac- tice of raising a mixture of crops and pasture ani? mals; the maintenance of control over lands suitable to both pastoral or agricultural pursuits by means of tribal organization; the maintenance of a flexible tribal ideology that permits incorporation and exclusion of individuals and households as need arises; the practice of moving into tents for the warmer months of the agricultural season and into houses or caves during the cooler months; and the existence along various points on the nomad- DISCUSSION The evidence that has come to light from the three seasons of fieldwork at Tell el-cUmeiri and vicinity has considerably advanced our under? standing of the phenomena of sedentarization and nomadization on the Madaba Plains when mea? sured against the results of the Heshbon Expedi? tion. Although we have replicated the results of the Hesban project insofar as we have again docu? mented the transient nature of permanent settle? ments in the region, by using an entirely separate set of data and improved methods of data collec? tion, the cUmeiri project has added much new in- sight and information: First, we now have solid stratigraphic evidence for intensification and abatement in settlement ac? tivity throughout the Bronze Age (a period about which Tell Hesban was silent). At Tell el-cUmeiri a site-wide settlement, perhaps a minor urban cen? ter, came into existence during EB III. After reach- ing its peak, however, settlement appears to have abated gradually. By EB IV, therefore, what was left of the town were mostly ruins. Then again, during the MB IIC, an unfortified village appears to have been established that gradually became transformed into a fortified settlement with mas? sive ramparts. It too, however, appears to have been a transient settlement by the Late Bronze Age because all that has so far been detected is a single layer of Late Bronze Age debris. Secondly, much more information has come to light about the Iron Age as well. Two major peaks</page><page sequence="120">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 117 in the intensity of settlement activity, one during Iron I and the other during late Iron II, are attested now by evidence from Tell Hesban, Tell el- cUmeiri and Tell Jawa. That Tell el-cUmeiri itself was some sort of administrative center during the Iron II period has already been noted. It may have been some sort of "agro-town," a settlement that was chiefly populated and serviced by farmers and agricultural laborers and included urban institu? tions, urban social strata, and urban functions. To this tell evidence may now be added the data yielded by the hinterland surveys which have brought to light numerous farmsteads and related agricultural installations from the Iron Age II. As was noted earlier, that evidence suggests that much of the population during the Iron II probably lived on small farmsteads throughout the hinterland (London 1989). Thirdly, as a result of excavations in 1987 at Rujm Selim, and in 1989 at ed-Dreijat, important new information has now come to light about the Madaba Plains during the Hellenistic period. While large settlements such as cUmeiri and Jawa were mostly ruins, people continued to live at Rujm Selim and ed-Dreijat. Thus, while the center of political gravity may well have been in the hands of more nomadic peoples during those cen? turies, the region was not without permanent set? tlements. It should be noted in this connection that there is evidence of people living in caves at Tell Hesban during the late Hellenistic and early Ro? man periods. Caves probably were widely used as shelters for people and animals during those centu? ries, much as they were during the Ottoman period. Fourth, as a result of our intensive investiga? tions in the Wadi el-Bisharat, much more infor? mation has been gained about how the large population that inhabited the cUmeiri region dur? ing the Roman and Byzantine periods provided for their food needs. Their secret was intensive man- agement of surface water to prevent soil erosion and to provide water for crops. Their strategies in? cluded building embankments at regular intervals in the main wadi, di version dams in the larger trib? utary wadis, and bands of terraces on the slopes leading down to the wadis. In addition, large reser- voirs and cisterns stored water for irrigation. Roads made of cobbled stones connected this and other productive wadis with surrounding cities, such as existed at cUmeiri South, Site 57, Hesban (Esbus), ancient Amman (Philadelphia), and else? where throughout the Roman world. Thus food and other items were being imported and exported. Fifth, while our excavations at Tell Hesban con- tributed significantly to our knowledge of Ayyubid- Mamluk times (ca. 1174-1516 c.e.), there were "gaps" in occupation at Tell Hesban that preceded and followed. Those gaps correspond to the Abbasid-Fatimid (ca. 750-1174 c.e.) and Ottoman (ca. 1517-1918 c.e.) periods, respectively. It is pre? cisely because of what those gaps could teach us about how people lived in the region?when there supposedly were no or few permanent villages or towns?that the survey devoted considerable effort to finding out about them. As already noted, our efforts have focused on the residential uses of caves and fortified residential compounds (qusur) during Ottoman times. A significant discovery in this re? gard is cUmeiri North, where a good example of an Ottoman seasonal cave village has been found. Sixth, what we have learned through our eth- noarchaeological research about how sedentariza- tion and nomadization actually happen on the household, tribal, and village levels also represents a significant step forward since the Hesban project. The results of this line of research have heightened considerably our confidence in our ability to test the sedentarization-nomadization hypothesis. It has also led to our becoming aware of many new ques? tions that we would like to find ways to answer in future seasons. FUTURE PLANS Overall, the sedentarization-nomadization hy? pothesis goes a long way toward accounting for the rise and decline of permanent settlements in the Madaba Plains region. However, we still would like to address a large number of issues. Among them are the following. ? Although the excavations at Tell el-cUmeiri have revealed considerable changes over time in the extent to which the site was settled, more work is needed to ascertain the precise nature of its suc? cessive settlements. Future excavations must be specifically designed to learn whether and when a site was a seasonal settlement occupied by semino- mads, and when it was a village occupied year- round by subsistence farmers, a minor or major agro-town, or something completely different. The same questions need to be asked of Tell Jawa, ed- Dreijat, and Rujm Selim. Finding the answers will require in-depth analysis of the many types of arti? facts and biofacts unearthed at all of those sites.</page><page sequence="121">118 LABIANCA AND OTHERS AASOR 52 ? Much more work is needed to determine what happened during such low intensity periods as the Late Bronze Age, the Early Hellenistic, Abbasid, Fatimid and Ottoman periods. An important line of research in this regard will be to excavate a number of caves to see if deposits from those periods exist. Excavation of more farmstead sites such as ed- Dreijat and Rujm Selim should also be valuable. ? One of the greatest challenges facing this project is to come to grips with the factors that generated the cyclic pattern of sedentarization and nomadization. While many of the clues to the problem are contained in the materials being exca? vated, a much needed additional line of inquiry in- volves textual sources. For example, information about influential persons, ethnic groups, and events in the Madaba Plains region can be gleaned from written sources of Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Jew? ish, Patristic, Arabic, and Turkish origins. While some work has already been done in this regard (cf. Geraty and Running 1989), a more concerted effort is needed. ? After two decades of archaeological involve- ment in the Madaba Plains, our curiosity about Tell Jalul has increased. The site is intriguing be? cause of its size, particularly given its location. It is located about 7 km due east of Madaba, where it receives significantly less rainfall than either Hes? ban or cUmeiri. It is also farther from major wadis or springs. Yet it is Jordan's second largest tell (after Tell Husn), covering an area of about 17 acres. Its surface has an abundance of sherds from the Bronze and Iron ages (Ibach 1988). Excavations at Tell Jalul would not only deepen our understanding of the second and first millennia b.ce., it would provide us with a third subregion within the Madaba Plains in which to examine the sedentarization-nomadization hypothesis. To Tell Hesban, which overlooks the western edge of the plain, and to Tell el-cUmeiri, located in the hill country on the plain's northern edge, we would like to add Jalul, on the plains' eastern perimeter near the edge of the desert. These are three different eco- logical regions in which to test the sedentarization- nomadization hypothesis. NOTES 1 In 1989, the entire staff of the Madaba Plains Project numbered 130 persons, of whom about 80 worked on Tell el-cUmeiri, about 40 worked in the hinterland, and the rest stayed behind at the project's headquarters in Amman, housed at the Amman Baptist School. 2In pursuing this interest Herr has been assisted by field supervisors J. Lawlor (Baptist Bible College), Field A; D. Clark (Walla Walla College), Field B; T. Harrison (University of Chicago), Field D; R. Low (University of Maryland), Field F and J. Fisher (Andrews University), Field G. 3Assisting Younker were field supervisors M. Daviau (Wilfrid Laurier University), Tell Jawa and L. Hubbard (Andrews University), ed-Dreijat. 4These teams were headed by G. Christopherson (University of Arizona) and D. Schnurrenberger (Uni? versity of Maryland) respectively. 5This survey was headed by J. Battenfield (Grace Theological Seminary). 6D. Irvin (Durham, North Carolina) and 0. LaBianca (Andrews University) headed this survey. J. Cole (Walla Walla College) led the subsurface mapping team, as? sisted by G. Sandness and B. Matson. 7In the object registration lab, E. Platt recorded all objects, including those related to the quest for food and long-distance trade networks and social stratification represented at Tell el-cUmeiri, Tell Jawa, and ed-Dreijat. Also important are the contributions of the ecology lab, in which lithic samples, soil samples, plant and animal remains produced by the excavations were processed. Through preliminary analysis of these remains in the field, information directly relevant to ascertaining envi- ronmental, landuse, and dietary conditions in the past has been made available. 8 See subsequent discussion on the identity of Tell Jawa in R. W. Younker and P. M. Daviau, "Is MefaDat to be Found at Tell Jawa (South)?" in IEJ 43/1, pp. 23-28, 1993; Z. Kallai, "A Note on 'Is MefaDat to be Found at Tell Jawa (South)?" by R. W. Younker and P. M. Daviau, IEJ 43/2, pp. 249-251, 1993. While Kallai raises some questions concerning the dating of the reference to Mo- ab's occupation of Mephaath in Jeremiah 48, most bibli? cal references seem to locate Mephaath on the Meshor, or the plain. However, Tell Jawa is clearly on the highlands south of Amman and not on the plain. This still raises in our minds the question whether Jawa can be Mephaath.</page><page sequence="122">1994 MADABA PLAINS PROJECT: THE 1989 SEASON 119 BIBLIOGRAPHY Alt, A. 1932 Paldstina Jahrbuch des Deutschen Evange- lischen Instituts fiir Altertumswissenschaft des Heiligen Landes zu Jerusalem, Vol. 29, p. 26.

The wall, ca. 2 m wide, consists of two faces of large ashlars bonded by a rubble and concrete core, founded on a bedding of field stones in the sand. The inner face carried a decorative plaster finish. Archaeological and historical evidence indicate a date in the fifth century for the founding of the wall. The wall presumably went out of use after the Muslim conquest of ca. 640. Several burials within the wall belong to the Byzantine or early medieval period. The Combined Caesarea Expeditions (CCE) renewed exploration of the Byzantine city wall at Caesarea Maritima in 1989. A team of nine volunteers supported CCE's professional staff in the excavation of Area V/4 from 28 May to 23 June. Because we plan no further excavation of the area, this article constitutes the final report. STATE OF THE PROBLEM Caesarea's Byzantine city wall runs in a broad semicircle enclosing some 110-120 hectares. A. Frova, of the Missione Archeologica Italiana, exca? vated several segments of the wall in its northeast- ern are (our Area V) in 1959.1 The wall had long been known, but it was considered Roman (either Herodian or third century) until Frova established its Byzantine date (Levine 1975: 9). Additional work since 1959 has contributed further informa? tion about the wall, but many questions remain re? garding its chronology, construction, and purpose. Recent agricultural activity, moreover, has de? stroyed or buried much that was visible on land and by aerial photography at mid-century. It there? fore seems advisable to review the state of the problem in addition to describing the work of CCE on the wall in 1989. The Italian excavators cleared a square tower 7.5 m wide and projecting 2.5 m from the wall (map reference 140800/212525; figs. 1-3). CCE cleaned the area around the tower to reexamine the structures. The builders of the tower made it inte- gral with the wall and of the same type of con? struction (described below). An opening on the inner face of the wall gives access to the inside of the tower, and the interior walls retain traces of plaster. Inside the city wall Frova found a second wall abutting but not bonded to the main wall, with an opening to permit access to the tower. The sec? ondary wall, ca. 1.6 m wide, consists of mortared ashlars founded on sand at a level much higher than the curtain wall and tower. Excavation weak- ened part of the secondary wall, which has now toppled away from the tower. Frova identified the secondary wall as a reinforcing wall and found that it continued in other trenches to the northeast (Frova 1959: 18). It does not continue southeast into Area V/4. A circular installation of poor construction oc- cupies the northern angle between the tower and the curtain wall. A single wythe of small, irregu- larly dressed stones, laid in earth with some brick, survives up to three courses high; remarkably, the builders actually carved out part of the angle of the wall and tower to secure a circular plan (fig. 4).

This plan does not plot a fragmentary and unstable extension of the sec? ondary wall adjacent to the curtain wall just south of the tower (but visible in fig. 3). CCE drawing. opening ca. 0.3 m wide furnished access to the in? side. Variously identified as a granary or a round tower (Frova 1959: 18; Ringel 1975: 75), the struc? ture probably functioned as a lime kiln. About 2 m in front of the tower lies a pavement of large stones; its full extent remains unknown. Frova found no evidence for an earlier city wall. Inside the wall just south of the tower, Frova uncovered a sarcophagus within a stone-lined pit and inexplicable clusters of Byzantine amphorae with their tops sawed off, some placed upright and others upended. The sarcophagus held some of the bones of two persons, and just to the south lay two human skulls. The Italian expedition recovered pottery, a lamp, and a corroded coin, all Byzantine, from near the wall and the tower. Merely on the basis of levels and without stratigraphic evidence, Frova dated the retaining wall to the end of the Byzantine period, long after the construction of the main wall earlier in the Byzantine period and after the place? ment of the sarcophagus and amphorae. The Survey of Western Palestine plotted a circuit wall complete except at the southwestern end near the theater (Conder and Kitchener 1882). Fifty years later, dune sand had obliterated any trace of the wall south of the hippodrome. Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, Reifenberg (1950-51: 20-32, pl. 16), Levine (1975: Map B), and Ringel (1975: 41, fig. 3; 75) studied the city wall of Caesarea with the aid of aerial photographs and identified a second square tower some 150 or 200 m to the northwest and a third ca. 450-500 m to the southeast. They also located a monumental gateway at the eastern extremity of the city, where the modern road inter- sects the conjectured line of the wall.2 I can detect no evidence for those features in aerial photographs that I have seen, and none appears on the surface to? day. Only the segment from Area V/4 northwest to the coast appears on the surface, along with a short section that the sea has exposed where the wall reaches the coast on the south. The Caesarea Ancient Harbor Exploration Project tried to locate Caesarea's eastern gate in 1988; three trenches exposed only large demol- ished segments of the wall pushed to the edges of modern fields.3 Those vermiform rows of rubble probably account for much of the supposed line of the wall that appears in plans of the city. In the winter of 1985-1986 Peleg and Reich con? ducted a rescue excavation on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority below a tile factory inside Kibbutz Sdot Yam on Caesarea's southern side, ca. 300 m east of the shore (map reference 14015/ 21125; Peleg and Reich 1992). They discovered a segment ca. 22 m long of the city wall, pierced by two of the openings of a presumed triple gate (Stratum II) built over a massive Herodian or early Roman building (Stratum I). The gate went through several phases. The excavators dated the walFs original construction to after the mid fourth century because they found a coin of Constantius II (324- 361) sealed below a floor from the time of the con? struction of the gate (Peleg and Reich 1992: 141,</page><page sequence="126">124 CLAYTON MILES LEHMANN AASOR 52 Fig. 3. View northwest over city wall, with tower (to right) and secondary or reinforcing wall (to left). Photograph by Mark Little. 142, 165). The ceramic material from this phase points to a date in the fifth century for the wall's con? struction (Peleg and Reich 1992: 148-53; the ce? ramic evidence includes fifth century but no clearly sixth century types like those attested in the follow? ing phases of Stratum II). No earlier than the sixth century the gate received a "balcony" (Peleg and Reich 1992: 165). Numismatic evidence indicates that no later than the early seventh century, and probably as an emergency defense against the Per? sian threat in 614 or the Muslim attack about 640, the people of Caesarea blocked the gates.4 Finally, Humphrey, leading a team for the Joint Expedition to Caesarea Maritima in 1974, explored a short segment of the inner face of the city wall behind the hippodrome (Humphrey 1975: 9-15, figs. 7-9; Riley 1975: 25). A thick coat of plaster carried inci? sions that indicate the joints of the stones beneath and hatch marks that mimic rusticated masonry. Humphrey found a large quantity of broken pottery Fig. 4. Kiln built into city wall, view from the west. Photo? graph by Mark Little. dumped against the inside of the city wall in two distinct layers. The lower layer dated predominantly to the fourth century, the upper layer to the sixth. Humphrey suggested that the lower layer of pottery stabilized the city wall and tentatively dated its con? struction to the fourth to early fifth century. He also thought that the upper layer of pottery put the wall out of use at the end of the Byzantine period or early in the Muslim period. But a few fragments of Is? lamic fine ware no earlier than the eighth or ninth century, found in the lower layer, make the entire dump post-Byzantine, of no value as evidence for the date of the wall's construction (Humphrey 1975: 6, 9, 15; for the pottery of the lower layer [Levels H1B and H2B], including three fragments of Islamic fine wear, see Riley 1975: 25-26, 40-43). An inscription found near the conjectured site of the eastern gate furnishes the only possible docu- mentary evidence for the date of the Byzantine wall. The text commemorates the construction of a (toup-</page><page sequence="127">1994 THE EXCAVATION OF CAESAREA'S BYZANTINE CITY WALL 125 +17.46 16.35 + AREA V/4 PLAN METERS Fig. 5. Plan of Area V/4.

That luminary held office sometime between the end of the fourth century and 536, because before and after that pe? riod governors of the province held proconsular rank (Mayerson 1988). Alexander's tower might have graced his capital's city wall, either in its origi? nal construction or in a remodeling.</page><page sequence="128">126 CLAYTON MILES LEHMANN AASOR 52 Fig. 6.

Photograph by Mark Little. THE EXCAVATIONS OF 1989 In the 1989 season, CCE volunteers excavated Area V/4, laid athwart the city wall ca. 25-30 m southeast of the tower that the Italian Mission had cleared (figs. 2, 5, 6). We hoped that the excava? tion, which continued an effort begun the previous summer, would secure additional information on the structure and chronology of the wall. The trench exposed nearly 10 m of the inner face and nearly 2 m of the outer face of the wall to its entire extant height. A core of concrete and rub? ble bonds together two faces of large ashlars of the local calcareous sandstone, called kurkar, finished with the drove, and now badly eroded and discol- ored where exposed or in contact with topsoil. On its western face the wall survives eight courses above the footings, to a height of ca. 2.8 m (fig. 7). The footings consist of large fieldstones and some small ashlars in one or two courses, with chinks and earth but no mortar, on a bedding of sand and cobblestones. Following the inclination of the terrain, the footings slope and step from 15.02 m above mean sea level at the northern side of the trench down to 14.50 m at the southern side. The footings support two courses of ashlars of irregular size with no evidence of mortar. Above them lie courses of much larger blocks of varying</page><page sequence="129">1994 THE EXCAVATION OF CAESAREA'S BYZANTINE CITY WALL 127 Fig. 8. Eastern face of wall in Area V/4. Photograph by Mark Little. dimensions, usually greater in length than in height except in the fourth and fifth courses toward the southern part of the square. The masons laid the up? per courses dry, with chinks, then pointed them with a fine, white plaster that has a porous and chalky composition, with very fine sand. Below the fourth course they pointed some joints with a gray, soft mortar with many charcoal inclusions. Finally, the masons pargeted the face of the wall with the fine plaster and cut rectilinear incisions over the joints of the ashlars beneath. Portions of the parget survive near the southern end of the trench. It recalls the decorative treatment of the walls of the Byzantine intramural fortress around Caesarea's theater and the wall in Humphrey's trench behind the hippodrome, but in Area V/4 the plaster lacks the rusticating hatch marks (Humphrey 1975: fig. 8). The eastern face of the wall survives to a lower elevation than the western, e.g., 17.20 m as op? posed to 17.45 m (fig. 8). The eastern face eroded more than the other because wind-blown sand, which drifted high against the western face and protected it from the weather, accumulated more slowly and to a lesser depth against the eastern face. Furthermore, the acidic topsoil that con- stitutes much of the fill on the eastern side ex- acerbated the outleeching of minerals from the limestone and its subsequent erosion. A probe against this face of the wall exposed its footings at 13.75 m (fig. 9). Stepped in two courses, the foot? ings rest on a bedding of cobblestones and sand. Six to seven courses of ashlars survive above the footings, mortared together and not merely pointed with the fine white plaster described above. The ashlars approximate those on the west in size. No traces of plaster survive on this badly Fig. 9. Probe at southern end of eastern face of wall in Area V/4, with southern balk. Photograph by Mark Little. eroded face, but the soil next to it contains chunks of plaster that might once have adhered to the face of the wall. A core of fieldstones, gravel, pottery sherds, and concrete binds together the two faces of the wall. The concrete has a light gray color and contains</page><page sequence="130">128 CLAYTON MILES LEHMANN AASOR 52 -14 masl. Fig. 10. Sections AA and BB of Area V/4. CCE drawing. pebbles, sand, and pieces of charcoal. The core measures ca. 0.70 m wide, the wall a little over 2 m, and the footings nearly 2.5 m. Grade at the time of founding probably lay just over 15 m above mean sea level, sloping down to the east. The hill on which the tower and this seg? ment of the wall stand rises higher than any other point in the city except for its extreme eastern edge. The designers placed the wall for optimum strate? gic value near the top and on the outer or eastern side of the crest. Excavation on the western side of the wall showed that its foundation lies in a trench cut in sand. Section BB (fig. 10) gives a possible profile of the trench, although later burials along the inside of the wall disrupted the stratification; the burials (described below) and movement of the dunes (evident from the layers blown up against the wall5) introduced material of the Early Roman to Crusader periods. A probe along the northern balk proved that the footings of the wall rest on nothing but sand (Magness, this issue, pp. 133-45, presents a ceramic analysis of the pottery from this and the other loci mentioned here). Just outside the exca? vated area to the east a line of stones, perhaps the exposed part of a retaining wall, runs parallel to the wall. Between the wall and the line of stones we found a layer of trash (Locus 4061)?mostly bro? ken pottery and glass?over 1.25 m thick (figs. 9, 10), dating from the sixth to the first half of the seventh century. Locus 4071, next to the footings, contained much less pottery and a more silty, al? most claylike, darker soil. Unfortunately, the pot? tery from Locus 4071, which should have provided the most secure date for the walPs construction, in? cludes no diagnostic sherds; nor does the pottery from the last four or five baskets of Locus 4061, just above Locus 4071. Because the evidence from Peleg and Reich's excavation of the southern gate indicates a date in the fifth century, and because for historical reasons discussed below the seventh cen? tury seems far too late for the wall's construction, we prefer to understand Locus 4061 as a post- construction dump rather than backfill from the time of construction (see Magness, this issue, pp. 133- 45). The dump, within the possible retaining wall on the eastern edge of Area V/4, might have but- tressed the wall just above the level of the footings and strengthened the city's fortifications on the eve of the Persian or Muslim siege. According with this conjecture, we may understand that the secondary wall inside the tower and the blockage of the south? ern gate fulfill the same role. Palestine's Byzantine emperors tried repeatedly to enhance the province's urban amenities and de- fenses. According to Procopius of Gaza, for exam? ple, the emperor Anastasius's efforts to restore the</page><page sequence="131">1994 THE EXCAVATION OF CAESAREA'S BYZANTINE CITY WALL 129 prosperity of Palestine after a Samaritan uprising in 484 included the improvement of Caesarea's harbor (Procop. Gaz. Pan. 19 [Chauvot 1986]). Procopius of Caesarea reports that Justinian embellished many cities and monasteries in Palestine by building or restoring churches, walls, wells or cisterns, and charitable institutions, and that he responded to Samaritan violence by restoring Christian holy places and building a wall around the Christian church on the Samaritans' Mt. Garizim (Proc. Aed. 5.6-29; cf. Holum 1982). Caesarea's wall seems far less formidable than the walls of other imperial cit? ies that faced threats from large, organized, and well-equipped armies?as, for example, Antioch on the highway to Persia did?or from the huge plun- dering expeditions of Germans and Huns?for ex? ample, Thessalonica and Constantinople itself. Nor does Caesarea's wall measure up to the standards set in the anonymous De Strategica of the sixth century, which recommends a thickness of some 3 m for a city's fortifications. But Caesarea's wall does compare favorably to border forts on the Ara? bian frontier, like the late fourth century fort at DEn Boqeq in southern Palestine on the western shore of the Dead Sea, which has walls 1.75-2.0 m thick. Such fortifications, like Caesarea's, defended set? tled communities from bandits and raiders and did not require the thick walls and deep foundations necessary to resist artillery, ramming, and mining.6 Caesarea received its circuit wall in the context of Samaritan violence and banditry, imperial generos- ity, and the remarkable growth of the city in the Byzantine period (Holum, et al., 1988: 155-200). The pottery from the southern gate suggests a date in the fifth century, and if the bourgos inscription mentioned above does indeed record an addition to the new or existing wall, it furnishes a terminus ante quem of 536 for the foundation of the Byzan? tine city wall. The 1989 season uncovered no evidence for abandonment of the wall. The complex layering cre? ated by wind and sand cannot determine chronology (Rim 1950-51: 44). Presumably the wall went out of use after the Muslim conquest about 640, when large tracts of intramural Caesarea reverted to fields, cemeteries, and sand dunes as the population plum- meted (Holum, et al. 1988: 203-5). We found no evidence of occupation in Area V/4 previous to the construction of the wall. After the Byzantine period the area became a cemetery. We recovered an unrestorable fragment of a Byzantine tombstone (V4073.il) and five or six burials, poor graves with no associated artifacts, interred at in- determinate dates after the wall's founding. Pottery intrusive from the soft sand around the bodies dated early Roman to Byzantine. Two or three burials lay right up against the footings of the wall, the others within two or three meters of the wall and at a slightly higher elevation, in irregular ori? entation and body position. Our physical anthro- pologists identified burial no. 1 (Locus 4066) possibly as an adolescent female; no. 2 (Locus 4065) as an adult female; no. 3 (Locus 4064) as an adult male; no. 5 (Locus 4068) as an adult; and no. 6 (Locus 4070) as an adult male (no. 4 [Locus 4067], very disturbed, may belong with no. 6).7 Numerous Byzantine tombstones come from out? side the wall in this region of the city, and the sar? cophagus that the Italian excavators found just inside the tower north of Area V/4 dated to the Byzantine period. We lack sufficient evidence to identify the burials in Area V/4 as either Byzantine or Muslim. From the dunes we extracted one unreadable coin and numerous fragments of such materials as glass, animal bones, shells, and tesserae of too little interest to describe here.

Except for brief notices, only one other report describes the Italian excavation of the Byz? antine city wall (Frova 1961-1962: 649-50). The area enclosed by the wall depends on the hypothetically re? stored course of the southern and southeastern part of the circuit; thus planimetric measurement of Conder and Kitchener (1988: 14) yields ca. 109 ha (ca. 269 acres), Holum, et al. (1992: fig. 1) ca. 123 ha (ca. 304 acres). 2All three scholars publish maps showing these fea? tures without any explanation. The map of the Survey of Western Palestine shows only one feature in the wall, a rectilinear deviation much too large for a tower (Conder and Kitchener 1882: 14). 3 Raban, et al. 1990: 252-54. The plan published in this report (fig. 5, p. 253) does not accurately give the relation between the tower and Area V/4. 4Peleg and Reich (1992) associated the blockage of the gate with the Muslim attack only, but there seems no reason to exclude the period of Persian threat as well, even though in the event the Persians took the city with- out resistance. Holum 1992: 73-75 reviews the literary evidence for these conquests. 5 The layers visible in the balk, particularly on the windward or western side, graduate subtly in color and texture according to the action of wind and sand. Unless we found the distinction between given layers remarkable we did not differentiate them by locus during excavation. 6Lawrence 1983: 175-76 (Arabian frontier); 188- 200, esp. pp. 189-90 (De Strategica).

Next to the foundations of the wall, a thick layer of pottery was discovered which represents a homogeneous dump of sixth to mid-seventh century date.1 It appears to have been deposited to strengthen the line of fortifications on the eve ofthe Muslim siege. The evidence from Area V/4 and from other excavations around Caesarea suggests that the Byzantine city wall was constructed in the fifth century. Modifications and changes were carried out during the sixth century, and efforts to strengthen it were made in preparation for the Mus? lim siege. Following the fall of the city to the Muslims, the wall went out of use and some formerly settled areas within it were abandoned. INTRODUCTION The corpus of pottery presented here derives from a single locus (4061) in Area V/4 at Caesarea. Area V/4 represents a sounding along a section of the Byzantine city wall on the northeastern side of the site (Lehmann, this issue, pp. 121-31). The excavation in this area was car? ried out in the hope that it would shed light on the date and constructional history of the wall. Unfor? tunately, the stratification on the inner (western) face of the wall had been disturbed by later burials and by the movement of the sand dunes. Therefore no ceramic material recovered from inside the line of the wall could be associated with its foundation. Furthermore, no diagnostic sherds were recovered from locus 4071, which represents the foundation trench on the outer (eastern) side of the wall. How? ever, a 1.25 to 1.50 meter thick layer of pottery and debris (locus 4061) was discovered above Lo? cus 4071, between the outer face of the wall and a line of stones further east. Its position just above the foundation level suggests that it was intended to stabilize and buttress the wall against the sand dunes. The presence of many large fragments, none of which could be restored as whole vessels, indicates that the dump represents material brought in from elsewhere and deposited at this spot. That impression is reinforced by the freshness of the breaks and the generally unworn appearance of the sherds. The ceramic types represented in this dump constitute a remarkably homogeneous assemblage. Although no coins were recovered, most, if not all, of the ceramic types can be dated from the sixth to the first half of the seventh century. These include pieces that do not antedate the beginning of the seventh century (see fig. 1:3). Another pottery dump was discovered by Hum? phrey in his excavations against the upper part of the inner face of the Byzantine city wall by the hip- podrome (Humphrey 1975; Riley 1975). He distin? guished two layers, an upper one (H2A and H1A) and a lower one (H1B and H2B). Almost all of the pottery from the upper layer consisted of fifth to sixth century ceramic types, while the lower layer contained mostly third to fourth century material. On the basis of the ceramic evidence, Humphrey dated the dump to the end of the Byzantine period or beginning of the Islamic period, suggesting that it rendered the wall ineffective as a line of defense (Humphrey 1975: 15). However, three later sherds found deep in the lower layer, including two Islamic pieces that do not appear to antedate the eighth to ninth centuries, suggest that the dump was depos? ited long after the end of the Byzantine period.2 Humphrey's dump therefore differs from the one in Area V/4, which contained no Islamic material and was located next to the base of the wall. During the 1989 season at Caesarea Maritima, I worked alone as the staff's ceramic specialist.3 I 133</page><page sequence="135">134 JODIMAGNESS AASOR 52 attempted to develop a system for counting and weighing all the ceramic material recovered, to provide a basis for quantifying types and wares. In light of my experiences that summer, and with the addition of other ceramic specialists to the staff, the system was later refined. For example, due to my inexperience, and the overwhelming amount of material recovered from the field, I did not quan- tify amphoras according to type during the 1989 season. Despite its relatively general nature, how? ever, the information recorded is worth presenting. First, it is necessary to describe the system used for processing the material. Individual "bucket" numbers were assigned in the field to each physical bucket of pottery. A locus could include one or more such buckets, depending on the amount of pottery recovered. The sherds from each bucket were washed and laid out in boxes to dry. Each bucket of sherds was weighed as a whole, then sorted on a table into groups according to wares. These groups consisted of various fine wares ("black-glazed," "terra sigillata," "Late Roman Red Wares," "glazed"), cooking wares, amphoras and storage jars, other coarse wares, miscellaneous wares (such as oil lamps and terracottas), and roof tiles. Because in most cases even body sherds could be assigned without difficulty to one of those categories, they were included in the count. After the sorting was completed, the sherds were counted and weighed according to the ware group. A rough estimate of the chronological range of the bucket was recorded, and diagnostic sherds were selected to be saved. The data recovered from that process provide a clear indication of the proportions of the various wares represented in Locus 4061. They confirm the impression that storage jars and amphoras predom- inate in the Byzantine corpus at Caesarea (Riley 1975; Adan-Bayewitz 1986; Blakely 1987). Ofthe 137.9 kg of pottery recovered from Locus 4061, 130 kg (94%) consisted of storage jar and amphora fragments. In terms of numbers, this represents 1246 (90%) of the 1381 sherds recovered from the locus. The remainder consisted of cooking wares (103 sherds [7.4%] that weighed 5.05 kg [3.6%]); Late Roman Red Wares (13 sherds [0.94%] that weighed 0.25 kg [0.18%]); other coarse wares and miscellaneous wares (10 sherds [0.72%]), includ? ing two oil lamp fragments, which weighed 0.2 kg [0.14%]); and roof tiles (9 fragments [0.65%] that weighed 2.4 kg [1.7%]). The only non-Byzantine sherd from the locus, a fragment of terra sigillata, is not included in this count. Its presence high- lights the remarkable homogeneity of this assem? blage in terms of date. THE POTTERY A sample of the ceramic types found in Locus 4061 is illustrated in figs. 1-3. A description of each piece and a list of parallels appears in the cat? alogue below. The types are arranged and dis? cussed in the following order: bowls, casseroles, cooking pots, amphoras, storage jars, lids, jugs, flasks, and juglets. Bowls and cooking wares are il? lustrated in fig. 1. A sample of the imported Late Roman Red Wares present in the assemblage ap? pears in fig. 1:1-3. In the absence of numismatic evidence, these pieces provide the basic chrono? logical framework. They include examples of Afri- can Red Slip Ware (fig. 1:1) and Late Roman "C" or Phocean Red Slip Ware (fig. 1:2, 3), all dated from the late sixth to the mid-seventh century. The rim of a bowl of African Red Slip Ware Form 94, Type A, dated from the late fifth to the early sixth century, is not illustrated here (but see Hayes 1972: 146-48, 158-66, 343-46). The cooking wares in? clude various types of casseroles (fig. 1:4-9) and cooking pots (fig. 1:10-17). It is difficult to estab- lish an internal typology for casseroles, which are common during the late Roman and Byzantine pe? riods in Palestine. However, the casserole with wishbone handle (fig. 1:9) is a characteristic Ju- daean type of the sixth and seventh centuries. The type is rare at Caesarea, which seems to mark the northernmost point of its distribution (Magness 1992a: 133 and fig. 65.9; 1993: Casseroles Form 2). The parallels for the casserole in fig. 1:8, which is made of a coarse, gritty, dark red-brown ware, also point to a Judaean origin (see Birger 1981: pl. 12:12; Aharoni 1962: fig. 17:14). The one in fig. 1:4 is distinguished by its unusual folded rim and relatively smooth, hard-fired, orange-brown ware. Although no parallels were found, I suspect that it represents a western Galilean or Egyptian type. The cooking pots include types found through? out the country during the late Roman and Byzan? tine periods. The parallels for those in fig. 1:10-11, which have a straight, vertical neck and thickened rim, point to a Judaean origin. On the other hand, the cooking pots in fig. 1:12-14, with their short, everted rims, are clearly a characteristic northern Palestinian type. Most of the parallels for both types are dated to the sixth and seventh centuries. No parallels were found for the cooking pot in</page><page sequence="136">1994 THE POTTERY FROM AREA V/4 AT CAESAREA 135 fig. 1:15, which is made of a thin, smooth, hard- fired, orange-brown ware covered with a dark grey slip. The swollen rims and angular, flattened strap handles of the cooking pots in fig. 1:16-17 iden- tify them as a Cypriot type and highlight the cos- mopolitan character of Caesarea's corpus (Magness 1992a: 133). That the pieces from Area V/4 repre? sent imports rather than local imitations is sug? gested by the quality of their ware, which matches that of the Cypriot products.4 The presence of im? ported cooking pots at Caesarea provides striking evidence for the site's commercial contacts with other parts of the eastern Mediterranean during the Byzantine period. Imported amphoras are illustrated in fig. 2:1-7. Figure 2:1-2 presents two variants of the most common type of amphora found at Yassi Ada, both of which have published parallels from Caesarea (Magness 1992a: 150; Adan-Bayewitz 1986: fig. 2:4 [Amphora Type 5] and fig. 2:6 [Amphora Type 6]). Peacock and Williams (1986: 187) have sug? gested an early fifth to mid-seventh century range for amphoras of this type, which may come from Cyprus or Asia Minor. No close parallels were found for the amphoras in fig. 2:3, 5, but the one in fig. 2:4 represents a type attested at Jalame, for which a Palestinian origin and fourth century date are suggested (Johnson 1988: fig. 7-49:721 [Am? phora Form 1]). The amphora base in fig. 2:6 has possible North African parallels dating to the fifth and sixth centuries (Keay 1984: fig. 130:3 [Type LVII]). The base in fig. 2:7 might also represent a type of amphora of Tunisian origin and fourth to mid-fifth century date (Keay 1984: 209 no. 8 [Type XXV Variant 1]). It was recut for apparent use as a stopper, a phenomenon attested elsewhere at Cae? sarea (Adan-Bayewitz 1986: fig. 3:18; Siegelmann 1974: fig. 2:6; Peleg and Reich 1992: fig. 13:2). Storage jars or amphoras of Palestinian origin are illustrated in figs. 2:8-15 and 3:1-8. Three types are represented: southern Palestinian "bag- shaped" storage jars (fig. 2:8-15), "Gaza" storage jars or amphoras (fig. 3:1-6), and northern Pales? tinian white-painted storage jars (fig. 3:7-8). Al? though those jars were not counted and weighed according to type, this sample does reflect the rela? tive proportions in which they were represented. Our evidence accords with Riley's findings that the southern Palestinian bag-shaped storage jars pre- dominate at Caesarea, while Gaza storage jars are the second most common type, and the northern Palestinian white-painted storage jars are a distant third (Riley 1975; for a more recent discussion of these storage jar types and references see Magness 1992a: 130-32). The southern Palestinian bag- shaped jar rims from Locus 4061 (fig. 2:8-13) ap? pear to represent Riley's Type IB, which has a lower, simpler rim than his Type IA. The pieces in fig. 2:9, 11, 13, though belonging to the southern Palestinian type in form and ware, have concre? tions adhering to the outside of the rim, neck, and shoulder like those found on Gaza storage jars (Magness 1992a: 131). The bodies of the southern Palestinian bag-shaped storage jars are sometimes painted with white or yellow designs, like the frag? ments in fig. 2:14-15. The Gaza storage jars (fig. 3:1-6) have relatively simple rims and pointed bases, features that may indicate a sixth to seventh century date. Both the rim and the body sherd in fig. 3:7-8 have the metallic, dark-surfaced ware and white-painted decoration characteristic of the northern Palestinian storage jars. The prominent ridge marking the transition from the shoulder to the body on the piece in fig. 3:8 is another charac? teristic feature of the type. Lid handles are illustrated in fig. 3:9-12. The lid with a loop handle (fig. 3:9) is made of a thin, smooth, hard-fired, pink-red ware. The parallels suggest that this is a northern Palestinian or Egyp? tian type, as examples are also found at Kellia in Egypt (Magness 1992a: figs. 61:12; 66:13, with references). On the other hand, the pierced knob handle of thin, brittle, gritty, dark red cooking ware in fig. 3:10 represents a Judaean type that seems to be most common in contexts of the sixth to seventh century. The only parallels found for the rather unusual knob handle of a lid or stopper in fig. 3:11 come from Caesarea and Kellia (Adan- Bayewitz 1986: fig. 3:14; Egloff 1977: pl. 55:7 [Type 350]). It is made of a thick, dark orange cooking ware covered on the interior with a pur- ple-red slip. A number of parallels from sites around Palestine were found for the pierced knob handle in fig. 3:12, which is made of a thick, gritty, dark orange-brown ware covered with an orange- brown slip. Its identification as the handle of a lid rather than as the base of a jug is indicated by the hole pierced through its center before firing. It probably belongs to a type of bell-shaped lid com? mon at Jalame, where it is dated to the third and fourth centuries (Johnson 1988: figs. 7-55; 7-56). The jug base illustrated in fig. 3:13 is distin? guished by the pare-burnishing (or knife-paring) that covers its exterior, even on the base. Parallels for this piece come from beneath the pavement of Justinian's "Nea" Church in Jerusalem and from</page><page sequence="137">136 JODI MAGNESS AASOR 52 the foundations of the octagonal church on top of Caesarea's "temple platform," which appears to be ofthe same date (Magness 1992a: 132; fig. 59:17). These pieces seem related to "Fine Byzantine Ware," which appeared around the middle of the sixth century. The knob base of a jar or jug is illus? trated in fig. 3:14, while spouts belonging to jugs made of cooking ware appear in fig. 3:15-16. The molded fragment in fig. 3:17, made of thick, pink- brown ware, is part of a ceramic mirror plaque (Baly 1962: pl. 26:10-11; Rahmani 1964; Israeli 1974; Avni and Dahari 1990: 310; fig. 7). It is flat and circular, and is decorated in relief with con- centric circles surrounding a circular ridge. Two flasks with asymmetrical bodies are illus? trated in fig. 3:18-19. They differ in form and ware from contemporary flasks published from Khirbet Karak, Kursi, and Pella (Delougaz and Haines 1960: pl. 57:5-6; Tzaferis 1983: fig. 8:20; Walms- ley 1982: CN2028; Smith and Day 1989: pl. 54:12). The form and ware of the rims in fig. 3:20- 21, and the parallels found, suggest that they be? long to Fine Byzantine Ware juglets, which are of? ten decorated with incised gashes on the shoulder (Magness 1993: "Fine Byzantine Ware Jars, Jugs, and Juglets"; Magness 1992b: 160; fig. 9:10). The same might be true of the stump-based juglet in fig. 3:22, which represents a common type of the late Roman and Byzantine periods in Palestine (Magness 1992b: 153). CONCLUSION The ceramic material from Locus 4061 is rich in terms of the diversity of types represented, and ho? mogeneous in terms of its date. Most if not all of the types can be assigned to the sixth to mid- seventh century, while none has to be later than that. What is the relation of this dump to the Byz? antine city wall? Prior to the final analysis of the pottery, we believed the dump to be contemporary with the construction of the wall. However, since that would mean dating the establishment of the wall to the first half of the seventh century or later, we prefer to understand it as a post-constructional dump. Its position just above the foundation level suggests that it was intended to stabilize and but? tress the wall against the sand dunes. The pottery may have been deposited to strengthen the line of fortifications on the eve of the Muslim siege. Recently published evidence from a rescue ex? cavation at Caesarea helps to refine the chronology of the Byzantine wall. The excavation was carried out in 1985-1986 on behalf of the Israel Antiqui? ties Authority, under the direction of M. Peleg and R. Reich (1992). The excavation site was located along the southern segment of the Byzantine city wall, approximately 300 m east of the shoreline. Two main building phases, Strata I and II, and four subphases of Stratum II, were distinguished. The earlier Stratum I contains the remains of a massive substructure belonging to a Herodian or early Ro? man building. In Stratum II, the building was in- corporated into the line of the Byzantine city wall. The excavators have suggested that the remains of two gateways found in this line of wall originally formed part of a triple gate. A coin of Constan- tius II sealed beneath the earliest surface associ? ated with the wall and gates provides a mid-fourth century terminus post quem (Peleg and Reich 1992: 165). However, the ceramic material from that subphase (Stratum 11/1) points to a fifth cen? tury date for the wall's construction. That date is indicated by the presence of a Yassi Ada amphora and by the absence of clearly sixth century types such as those attested in the following subphases.5 After their establishment in the fifth century, the wall and gateway underwent a series of modifica? tions, which are clearly visible in the architectural and stratigraphic record. In the last subphase of Stratum II (II/4), architectural elements such as pieces of columns and statuary were brought in to reinforce the wall and block the gates (Peleg and Reich 1992: 144-45). The latest types associated with that subphase parallel those from Locus 4061 in Area V/4,6 suggesting that this activity was car? ried out at the time of the Muslim siege. This chro? nology is supported by the numismatic evidence, since the latest coins recovered by Peleg and Reich do not postdate the late sixth to early seventh cen? tury (Peleg and Reich 1992: 163-64). The Byzantine city wall seems to have fallen out of use after the Muslim conquest, when large intra- mural areas reverted to fields, cemeteries, and sand dunes. This is evident in many of the excavated ar? eas around Caesarea. In Area V/4, five or six poor post-Byzantine burials were discovered adjacent to the wall (see Lehmann, this issue, p. 121-31). In Humphrey's excavation, the pottery dump seems to have rendered the fortifications ineffective (Hum? phrey 1975: 9-15). Peleg and Reich have noted that after the Muslim conquest their area was abandoned and covered with sand dunes (Peleg and Reich 1992: 145). That also appears to be true in the area just south of the Crusader city (the Combined Cae-</page><page sequence="138">1994 THE POTTERY FROM AREA V/4 AT CAESAREA 137 sarea Expedition's Area KK), where rich Byzantine levels are covered with relatively sterile sand dunes with no evidence of post-Byzantine occupation (see Holum et al. 1992: 100). All available evidence points to a date in the fifth century for the construction of Caesarea's Byzantine city wall. Modifications and changes were carried out during the sixth century, and efforts to strengthen it were made on the eve of the Muslim siege. Following the fall of the city to the Muslims, the Byzantine city wall went out of use and some formerly settled areas within it were abandoned. NOTES 1 All dates in this article refer to the Common Era. 2See Humphrey 1975: 15; Riley 1975: 25, 37. Unfor? tunately, the pieces are not illustrated; the descriptions seem to refer to "Mefjer" or buff ware and glazed pottery. 3In subsequent seasons, A. M. Berlin and A. Boaz joined the staff as the Hellenistic to Early Roman and Islamic to Crusader ceramic specialists, respectively. 4 The ware of the Cypriot pots is described in Wil? liams 1989: 68, as follows: The clay is basically orange red (5YR6/8) to a dirty red (somewhat like 10R5/8) but tends to be fired grey or dark reddish grey on the exterior (10R4/1 or 4/2). It is very hard fired and often will emit an almost metallic ping when flicked with a fingernail. It is also very gritty to the touch and is full of white lime particles (often up to 0.001 in diameter). There are occasional dark grits and sometimes silver mica appears. For the Yassi Ada amphora from Stratum II/l see Peleg and Reich 1992: fig. 15:15; for the dating of this type see Peacock and Williams 1986: 187. The bowl in Peleg and Reich 1992: fig. 14:1, which comes from a Stratum II/3 context, represents a relatively late variant of Late Roman "C" or Phocean Red Slip Ware Form 3 (Hayes 1972: 329-34). 6See, for example, Peleg and Reich 1992: fig. 13:7 (Late Roman "C" or Phocean Red Slip Ware Form 10) and fig. 13:9 (a Cypriot cooking pot).

Cooley and Gary D. Pratico Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary South Hamilton, MA 01982 Tell Dothan is an impressive archaeological mound in the northern Samaria hills, some 22 km north of Shechem. The site was excavated by Joseph Free in nine seasons between 1953 and 1964. Notable among the discoveries was the western cemetery, three tombs on the western edge of the tell that date between the LB IIA and the early Iron Age. Tomb 1 was the largest and best preserved of the three burial contexts and was unusual in that it was stratified in five distinct levels. Each level produced a wealth of pottery and other artifacts, together with some 250-300 burials. As part of the publication phase of the Dothan Archaeological Project, this article will intro- duce the largely unpublished tombs of the western cemetery, focusing on Tomb I. THE TELL Location and Description Tell Dothan is in the northern Samaria Hills on the eastern side of the Dothan Valley, some 22 km north of Shechem and 10 km south of Jenin (fig. 1). Rising approximately 60 m above the surrounding valley, Tell Dothan is a prominent mound composed of nearly 15 m of stratified remains on top of a natural hill of some 45 m high. The site has a fairly flat top with steeply sloping sides. The summit comprises ap? proximately 10 acres and the occupied area of the slopes includes another 15 acres. Its area of occu? pation, therefore, consists of approximately 25 acres. The eastern and southern slopes are terraced today with olive groves that are watered from a spring on the south side of the tell. That water source likely served the site in antiquity. The rock formations exposed in the immediate environs of Tell Dothan are Eocene beds of lime? stone, chalky limestone, and soft chalk. The settle? ment was founded on a gently sloping ridge that consists of a thin cap of chalky limestone over the chalky subsurface. Though the upper unit is basi- cally a chalky limestone, a few exposures approach the classification of micritic limestone. Fresh expo? sures of the chalk are white, turning to gray with exposure to natural elements. Most of the chalk is homogeneous; iron stains are common, likely from pyrite inclusions. The site offered the ancients a suitable location for digging cisterns and tombs. The building material that was utilized in the settlement's architecture was quarried nearby. Identification Tell Dothan has been identified with the biblical city of the same name, mentioned in Genesis 37 as the place where Joseph found his brothers during their wanderings with their father's flocks. Accord? ing to the narrative, Joseph was sent by his father Jacob from the Valley of Hebron to find his broth? ers in the region of Shechem but learned that they were tending the flocks in the area of Dothan. Thereafter, the narrative describes the intrigue that led to Joseph's being taken to Egypt by a caravan of Ishmaelites (or Midianites) who were traveling to Egypt via Dothan from Gilead. 147</page><page sequence="148">148 ROBERT E. COOLEY AND GARY D. PRATICO AASOR 52 H. Fig. 1. Aerial view of Tell Dothan and its immediate environs. The mound is clearly visible in the upper left of the photograph. Ruins are discernible across he summit, espe? cially on the southern side of the tell. The Dothan Valley stretches to the west of the site, through which the Jerusalem-Nablus-Jenin road runs. The compass orientation of this road is basically north-south.3 During the Monarchy, Dothan is described as a well-fortified city to which the Aramean king sent emissaries in search of the prophet Elisha (2 Kgs 6:13-14). It was in that context that Elisha's ser- vant was encouraged by a vision of heavenly forces arrayed on a hill east of town. Other literary references include three notations in the Book of Judith (3:9; 4:6, 7:3) and one in the Onomasticon of Eusebius (76:13). Strategic Importance ofthe Site Dothan is surrounded on the north, east, and south by hills that enclose the fertile Dothan Valley (figs. 1, 2). The site dominates this plain, which has always been of strategic importance as the eastern? most of the three main passes between the Sharon Plain and the Jezreel Valley through the mountain- ous ridge created by the northern Ephraimite hill country and the Carmel range. The main pass fol- lowed the Wadi cAra (Nahal cIron) and had the ad- vantage of being the shortest route between the coast and the Jezreel Valley, despite the strategic dis- advantages of the narrow defiles. The other passes were somewhat easier but longer. The southernmost of these alternative routes negotiated the mountain- ous spine via the Dothan Valley, reaching the Jezreel Valley south of Tacanach. The Ishmaelite/ Midianite caravan of Gen 37:25 probably traveled this route on its way from Gilead to Egypt. Excavation History and Publications Dothan was excavated by Joseph Free in nine seasons between 1953 and 1964 (fig. 3).1 The ex? pedition was not in the field in the years of 1957, 1961, or 1963. According to the excavator, the site yielded a nearly continuous occupational sequence in 21 levels, dating from the end of the Chal? colithic through the Byzantine period, with later occupation as late as the 14th century c.e. Free's excavations have never been published in technical detail, and even the preliminary reports provide few details on the site's rich architectural traditions and artifact assemblages (Free 1953; 1954; 1955; 1956a; 1956b; 1958a; 1959; 1960a; 1962 [see Sup- plemental Readings list for Free's popular writ- ings]; Ussishkin 1975).2 Preliminary reports were</page><page sequence="149">1994 TELL DOTHAN: THE WESTERN CEMETERY 149 Fig. 2. View of the Tell Dothan excavations taken during the 1960 season. Beyond the edge of the mound, the Dothan Valley stretches to the distant horizon. prepared for the eighth (1962) and ninth (1964) seasons, but they were never published. The 1953-1964 excavations represented the first of two phases in the Dothan Archaeological Project. The second phase of the project is a long-range un- dertaking that seeks to publish a multivolume final report on the nine-year campaign. The first volume will publish the western cemetery (Tombs 1, 2, and 3), excavated during the sixth to the ninth seasons. Subsequent publications will focus on the tell exca? vations, with emphasis on selected studies such as the city's various fortification systems, the Iron Age city, and the ruins of the acropolis area. The current article will introduce the largely unpublished tombs of the western cemetery, focusing on Tomb 1, with brief comment on the tell excavations.4 Location ofthe Western Cemetery in the Context ofthe Tell Excavations Dothan was investigated in six major areas of excavation (T, B, A, D, L, and K, moving from east to west). The western cemetery, which is the primary focus of this article, is located in Area K on the western end of the tell. Area T is located on the eastern extremity of the tell's summit. It encompassed the highest part of the mound and that designated by Free as the "acropolis" area (Free 1956a: 16-17; 1959: 26). Published data for Area B, just west of Area T and north of Area A, are exceptionally meager and consist of only a few observations related to re? mains of the Roman and Hellenistic periods.

Joseph Free, director of the Tell Dothan excavations. excavation records and Free's unpublished ninth season report provide a few more details regarding occupation during the Roman, Byzantine, and Me- dieval Arab periods. The central section of the top of the mound (Area A) was occupied by a Helle? nistic settlement, dating to the third and second centuries b.c.e., beneath which was a substantial Iron Age settlement (Free 1954: 15-16; 1955: 3-7; 1956a: 11, 14-15, fig. 2). The excavator's unpub? lished ninth season report provides some details re? garding a Middle Bronze Age "citadel" that was partially excavated during the eighth and ninth sea? sons. Area D, on the south side of the summit of the tell yielded remains that dated between the be? ginning of the Early Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron II period (Free 1953: 16-18; 1956b: 45-46). Subsequent work extended the later range to include the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The largest area of excavation was Area L, on the western summit of the mound, contiguous with the eastern side of Area K and the western ceme? tery. The slope section of that area yielded sub? stantial fortifications of the Early Bronze Age; and, although few published details are available, the area also produced sections of the city's Middle and Late Bronze Age defenses (Free 1958: 10-12). Further east in Area L, large sections of an Iron Age administrative building were uncovered (Free 1959: 22-24, 1960: 7-9). THE WESTERN CEMETERY: TOMBS 1, 2, AND 3 Discovery and Excavation Toward the end of the 1959 season, the excava? tors uncovered a circular, stone-lined pit in Area K (on the western side of the tell) that diminished in size until it funneled into a square-cut shaft in the bedrock. About 1 m down the shaft, a stone slab was uncovered, leaning against a vertical rock-cut doorway. Thus began the excavation of one of Dothan's most significant discoveries, the so-called western cemetery (fig. 4). The largest tomb of this cemetery (Tomb 1) was discovered four days before the conclusion of the 1959 season (figs. 5, 6). During those four days, the team worked around the clock in eight-hour shifts in the hope of clearing the burial chamber. Approximately 1 m of the tomb chamber was ex? posed; 52 objects were removed, including chal- ices, lamps, bowls, pyxides, and numerous other objects. Many vessels were complete, though frag? mented, and some were intact. The pottery dated to the early Iron Age. The excavators could not finish clearing the burial chamber before the end of the season, and sealed the tomb with reinforced con? crete until the following season. No one could have imagined that 2756 more vessels, 234 bronze objects, and several hundred burials awaited dis? covery. Archaeologists had uncovered the largest single-chambered tomb with the largest number of burial deposits to have been excavated in Palestine at that time. As noted above, the western cemetery was exca? vated over four seasons (1959, 1960, 1962, and 1964). Although Free was director of the Dothan Archaeological Project during those years, the tomb excavations were conducted under the direc? tion of R. E. Cooley, who is in charge of the publi? cation phase of the Dothan Archaeological Project, assisted by Gary Pratico. Very little of this stratified tomb has been pub? lished to date. Apart from dictionary and encyclo? pedia articles, the most substantive studies are to be found in preliminary reports (Free 1959: 26-28; 1960: 10-15) and in works largely concerned with</page><page sequence="151">1994 TELL DOTHAN: THE WESTERN CEMETERY 151 Fig. 4.

Note also the portion of the stepped entryway that is within the tomb chamber, to? gether with Crypts B (right) and A (left) on the northern and southern sides of the tomb chamber, respec? tively. Tombs 2 and 3 are just west of Tomb 1 (upper center). matters of interpretation (Cooley 1968; 1983). The western cemetery in general and its largest tomb in particular will be the primary focus of the remain- der of this article. Tomb Architecture (figs. 4-12) During the Late Bronze Age, a pit (approxi? mately 6 to 7 m deep) was cut into Early Bronze Age debris and lined with stones (fig. 7). The pit gradually diminished in circumference until it reached bedrock, at which point it became a shaft that opened to a stomion with seven steps that led into a very large burial chamber. Tomb 1 therefore consists of three architectural components: a vertical shaft, a stepped entryway, and the main tomb chamber in which were located eight crypts or loculi (figs. 4 and 5). Access to the stepped entryway and the main chamber was pro? vided through a well-cut vertical shaft on the west? ern side of the tomb (figs. 8, 9). The chamber has a west-east orientation. The shaft measures 1.75 m x 1.00 m wide and is 1.51 m deep. Of the seven steps that lead into the tomb chamber, three were located within the shaft. The shaft depth to the first step is 1.00 m, 1.32 m to the second step, and 1.51 m to the third step. The remaining four steps were within the tomb chamber; the seventh step is 3.30 m below the uppermost level of the shaft. The doorway to the tomb chamber was blocked by a stone slab that measured 1.10 m high x 1.00 m wide x 0.12 m thick. The tomb chamber is irregularly shaped, al? though basically rectangular with rounded corners. At its largest extremities, the chamber measures 10.65 m west to east (Crypt H to the western wall</page><page sequence="152">152 ROBERT E. COOLEY AND GARY D.

Excluding the crypts, the chamber walls measure 8.30 m west to east and 5.00 m north to south. The chamber contained eight crypts of which six were cut into the rock (A, C, D, E, F, and H) and two were constructed at a later time (B in the northwestern corner of the tomb and G at the extreme eastern end; figs. 6, 10-12, 14-16). The two later crypts were created by constructing stone walls below Crypts C and H respectively. Crypt di- mensions are as follows: Crypt A (1.20 m x 2.80 m), Crypt B (1.10 m x 2.30 m), Crypt C (1.13 m x 2.60 m), Crypt D (0.81 m x 2.25 m), Crypt E (0.79 m x 2.25 m), Crypt F (0.88 m x 2.30 m), Crypt G (0.80 m x 2.20 m), and Crypt H (1.20 m x 2.20 m). The depth of the tomb chamber, from the bedrock surface at the center to the collapsed ceiling, is 5.50 m. A small channel was discovered on the north? western side of the tomb, directly above Crypt C. This channel created an opening from the outside of the tomb to the interior of one of the chamber niches. The opening was roughly square on the in? terior, measuring 0.60 m x 0.60 m, narrowing to roughly circular on the exterior with a diameter of Table 1. Section Measurements for the Levels and Fills of Tomb 1 0.20 m. Two large storage jars, each with a dipper juglet, were associated with this channel. Both were discovered on the outside of the tomb cham? ber, just below the channel entrance. This opening, together with the associated pottery, obviously served a ritual function, perhaps for libation offer? ings for "feeding the tomb." Similar installations were discovered in the great tombs of Ugarit, dat? ing to the 14th and 13th centuries b.c.e. (Schaeffer 1939: 50-51). Tomb Stratification Although atypical for multiple burial tombs, Tomb 1 was clearly stratified. The uppermost level (Level 1) was completely sealed by the debris from the collapsed ceiling. Each of the five burial levels was clearly and completely separated from the next by a layer of limestone and/or earthen fill. The ear? liest level of burials (Level 5) was separated from the bedrock floor of the tomb by a layer of lime? stone and earthen fill. Table 1 presents the section measurements for the five levels of the tomb and the intervening fills. Pottery and Chronology of Tomb 1 (figs. 13:1- 13; 14-16, 19-35) Pottery vessels constitute the largest class of burial deposits, numbering approximately 2800 pieces categorized as lamps, bowls, jugs, dipper jugs, juglets, dipper juglets, pyxides, flasks, kraters,</page><page sequence="153">1994 TELL DOTHAN: THE WESTERN CEMETERY 153 Fig. 6. Detail of the view through the collapsed ceiling of Tomb 1, looking west. Crypt A is on the southern side of the tomb chamber. Crypts B and C are on the right, the northern side of the chamber. pots, strainer pots, jars, jar stands, storage jars, fun- nels, vases, stiirup cups, zoormorphic vessels, ker- noi rings, chalices, cooking pots, pitchers, and bowl stands (fig. 13:a-c). It should be noted that these categories represent the vessel nomenclature of the Dothan field records. Vessel designations will be refined in the final report, most importantly in the categories of jug, dipper jug, pot, jar, jar stand, vase, pitcher, and bowl stand. For an assemblage of selected pottery types from each of the five levels of Tomb 1, see figs. 19-35. Table 2 provides numerical details, level by level, for vessel types attested by more than ten ex? amples. The vessel nomenclature represents that utilized in the field records and pottery register. The tabulations are based on the numerical summaries recorded in the field reports. Vessel categories represented by less than ten examples throughout the five levels of the tomb include: jar, funnel, vase, milkbowl, strainer, bilbil, cooking pot, incense burner, kernos ring, special lamp forms, and anthro- pomorphic vessels. The pottery plates (figs. 19-35) present a repre? sentative assemblage of selected vessel types for the five levels of Tomb 1 (pyxides, biconical jars, chalices, krater-mugs, and lamps), together with examples of unique and unusual forms such as multihandled kraters and stirrup jars. The plates do not represent the range of vessel types present in this tomb or the many variations of form attested Table 2. Level Distribution of Selected Vessel Types in Tomb 1 within the vessel categories that are depicted and discussed below. Discussion will focus on the ty? pological distinctions of the various vessel types as they evolve through the five distinct levels of the tomb, together with some reference to comparative examples. These observations should be regarded as preliminary and tentative. The final report on the western cemetery will present the full range of pottery from Tombs 1 to 3, together with compara? tive and typological studies and complete technical descriptions.</page><page sequence="154">154 ROBERT E.

The chamber of ^ tV ^ - v i; ^""1 ^ ?* this cave burial was constructed beneath a level of Early Bronze Age remains. Cooley is kneeling on the bedrock surface just right of the collapsed ceiling of Tomb 1. A study of the balk to the left of the group reveals the following strati? graphic details: A 1-m-thick ash layer, dating to the Early Bronze Age, extends horizontally between the workman standing on the far left and the second vertical fissure, a distance of approximately 2 m. A 10 to 15 cm slippage in this ash layer (clearly seen in the first verti? cal fissure) was created when the tomb ceiling collapsed. Note the 1- m-wide section of the tomb ceiling that dropped the same distance, visible below and to the left of the bedrock surface upon which the group is standing. Further left, both the ash layer and the tomb ceiling collapsed nearly 2 m (to the left of the second vertical fissure), dropping well into the tomb chamber. The balk clearly documents, therefore, the construc? tion of the tomb chamber beneath a level of Early Bronze Age remains. This ash layer obviously was penetrated with the construction of the vertical shaft that gave access to the tomb chamber beneath the earlier remains. Fig. 8. Detail of the entrance to Tomb 1, photographed from within the tomb chamber and and looking west. The meter stick is resting on the sixth step, the second step above the floor of the tomb chamber. Six of the seven en? tryway steps are within the tomb chamber; three are within the shaft. A portion of the vertical shaft is visible above the uppermost step. Pyxides. The five levels of Tomb 1 produced more bowls than any other vessel type (607), fol- lowed by lamps (578) and pyxides (567). The pyxides of this tomb are a particularly rich and interesting assemblage with discernible evolution of form through the five levels of this burial con? text. The numbers are significantly greater in Lev? els 1 to 3 (173, 196, and 129 respectively), with 52 pyxides from Level 4 and only 17 from the earliest level. A selection of Level 1 pyxides is presented in fig. 19:1-12. Level 2 forms are depicted in fig. 24:1-9; Level 3, in figs. 28:1-12; Level 4, in fig. 32:1-7; the smaller numbers of Level 5 are repre? sented by the vessels of fig. 35:1-4, 6. These fig- ures present a representative selection of the main pyxides types for each level of Tomb 1, although variations abound in each level. As one studies the level-by-level arrangement of pyxides at Saint George's College in Jerusa? lem?the largest collection of this vessel type? the most obvious observation with respect to the evolution of this form is that the disk base pre- dominates in the later levels of the tomb (Levels 1 and 2: figs. 19:2-12; 24:4-9,11) and a rounded bottom characterizes the majority of vessels in the earlier levels (Levels 4 and 5: fig. 32:1-4,6,7; 35:1-4). Level 3 pyxides are fairly evenly divided between these two categories (fig. 28:1-4,6,7 with disk base; fig. 28:5, 8-12 with rounded bottom). A few rounded bottoms are attested in Levels 1</page><page sequence="155">1994 TELL DOTHAN: THE WESTERN CEMETERY 155 Fig. 9.

The chamber floor occupies the lower third of the photograph. The modern doorway rests on the fourth step. Rock-hewn Crypts A and C are seen on the ex? treme southern (left) and northern (right) sides of the tomb chamber. Crypt B, a later construction, was located just below Crypt C. (19:1) and 2 (24:10,12). Note the flat base of fig. 32:5 (Level 4). The rounded bottom of pyxides in Levels 3 to 5 should be characterized as slightly rounded, though some forms have bottoms that are sharply rounded (figs. 28:9,11; 32:2; 35:6). There are few significant variations in the body profile of Level 1 pyxides. The most common profile is illustrated by the vessels depicted in fig. 19:1-12 (cf. Guy 1938: pl. 62:19 with vertical loop handles; Loud 1948: pls. 77:7; 84:9; [fig. 24:12 here]; Guy 1938: pl. 69:2 [fig. 19:2 here]; pls. 14:5; 35:26 [fig. 19:4 here]; pl. 30:12 [fig. 19:9 here, lower body profile only]; McGovern 1986: fig. 53:48 [fig. 19:1 here]). As a general impres? sion, the body shape of the pyxides in subsequent levels tends increasingly to become bottom heavy; that is, the lowest of the two body carinations drops with respect to the base (figs. 24:1,2,4,8- 10,12; 28:5,7,10-12; 32:1,3,4,6; 35:1-4; cf.

As is clear in these examples, the ves? sel takes on a squat appearance compared to the more upright body profile of Level 1 forms. The lower body profile of fig. 24:9,12 is common in Levels 2 and 3 (cf. fig. 28:1 from Level 3), with parallels in imitation Mycenaean pyxis forms from Tell es-Sacidiyeh (Pritchard 1980: fig. 37:2) and Megiddo (Guy 1938: pls. 30:12; 62:18). Another common body profile in Levels 2 and 3 is that represented by figs. 24:11 (Guy 1938: pl. 20:5; Loud 1948: pl. 64:6) and 28:3 (Pritchard 1980: fig. 43:1, though with different rim profile). Beginning in Level 3, the body profile becomes slightly more angular between the two body carina- tions, as in fig. 28:2, 3, 7 (cf. Guy 1938: pl. 35:26).</page><page sequence="157">1994 TELL DOTHAN: THE WESTERN CEMETERY 157 The pyxis presented in fig. 32:2 from Level 4 repre? sents the earliest example of the bag-shaped body profile attested in all later levels of the tomb. The form is paralleled by other imitation Mycenaean pyxides, dating from Late Bronze II into Iron I (Pritchard 1980: figs. 8:2; 23:5; Tufnell 1958: pl. 82:925, 926; de Vaux 1952: 563, fig. 6:8; Loud 1948: pls. 68:9; 73:12; 77:7, 9; Yadin 1961: pl. 201:28). The vessel wall of earlier level pyxides at Tell Dothan is more angular between the two body carinations (figs. 28:2,3,5,7-9; 32:6,7; 35:2; cf. Prit? chard 1980: fig. 31:1 [fig. 28:7 here] with vertical loop handles). A simple or straight rim (vertical to slightly everted) is one of the most common rim profiles in all levels of the tomb (figs. 19:1,2,4,12; 24:1,3- 7,11,12; 28:3-6,8,11; 32:1,2,4; 35:1-3,6), though the vessels of Levels 4 and 5 tend to have shorter and more sharply everted necks (fig. 24:10). Al? though it has many subtle variations, a small trian? gular rim is also common in the three latest levels (figs. 19:5,8-10; 24:2,8; 28:2,12), with a few ex? amples in Levels 4 (fig. 32:3) and 5 (fig. 35:4). Note the grooved rim of fig. 19:7, which may also be characterized as triangular. Unusual and unique rim profiles are depicted in figs. 19:9,11; 24:9 and 32:5-7. Levels 1-3 produced both small and large pyx? ides, with the majority of forms classified in the small-to-medium range. Levels 4 and 5 produced very few large pyxides. Figures 32:1-4 and 35:1- 4 are illustrative of the typical vessel size of these earlier levels. Decoration is attested in all levels of the tomb, though more common in Levels 1 to 3. The pottery plates are not representative at this point, depicting mostly painted forms for these levels and few plain vessels. The latter are attested in significant num? bers. While the most common pattern in all levels consists of two clearly defined registers around the body of the pyxis with diagonal or vertical lines within the registers, there are discernible differ? ences between the earlier and later patterns. The pyxides of Level 1 are quite consistent in the painted patterns as described above. In most exam? ples, the two registers are of roughly equal size, though a few exceptions are attested. In figure 19:1, 6 and 7, the lower register is larger than the upper register. The same patterning prevails in the pyx? ides of Levels 2 and 3, though there is greater vari? ation in the size of the registers. In some pyxides of both levels, the upper register is smaller (figs. 24:1, 3,4,7,8; 28:12); whereas in other examples it is F/,:J1 K?% ffiv JP Fig. 13. The concentration of vessels throughout the five levels of the tomb is illustrated by this sequence of photo? graphs from Level 1 of Squares 2E, 2F, and 2G.</page><page sequence="158">158 ROBERT E.

This is the first in a sequence of three photographs (figs. 14-16) that document the progress of excavations in the eastern end of the Tomb 1 chamber. These three photographs also serve to illustrate the wealth and condition of the burial deposits. This first image depicts the concentration of pottery and skeletal remains in Level 1, the latest of the tomb's strata, looking east. Crypt F, a rock-hewn loculus on the northeastern side of the chamber, is visible in the upper left, just above and slightly left of the two multihandled kraters. Though barely visible through the debris, the uppermost portions of rock-hewn Crypt E are discernible in the upper center portion of the photograph. larger (fig. 28:1,3,4,8,9). A smaller upper register is more frequent in Levels 4 and 5 (figs. 32:1,3,4; 35:6), though the larger upper register is attested as well (fig. 32:2). Less frequent or unique decora- tions include those depicted in figs. 19:10,11 (cf. Guy 1938: pl. 62:17); 24:2; 28:6,10, and 35:1. Painted (rounded) bottoms (figs. 24:2,4; 28:10,12; 32:3,4) and handle decoration (figs. 19:1,3,4,6; 24:2; 28:1,3,6,8,9; 32:3,4; 35:1,6) are attested, but not with any discernible frequency or distribution. Biconical Jars. Biconical jars are evenly dis- tributed through Levels 1 to 4 with few examples attested in Level 5 (figs. 20:1-7; 25:1-6; 29:1-6; 32:8,9; 33:1,2). The biconical jars in Level 1 evi? dence great variety in rim profiles, unlike the bicon- icals in earlier levels of the tomb (fig. 20:1-5,7; cf. Yadin 1960: pl. 134:5 [20:3 here]). There are two dominant rim profiles in Level 2 vessels: rectangu? lar rim with a groove and near vertical stance (fig. 25:5,6); and triangular rim with groove and near vertical or slightly everted stance (fig. 25:1-4; cf. Pritchard 1980: fig. 11:2 [25:3 here]; Yadin 1960: pls. 120:15; 134:4). The triangular grooved rim of Level 2 continues into Level 3 (fig. 29:6), though sometimes without a groove (fig. 29:4). The rectan? gular grooved rim is also attested (fig. 29:3,5). A new and dominant rim profile is represented by the biconicals of fig. 29:1,2 (Guy 1938: pl. 17:12; Ya? din 1960: pls. 134:5; 152:5; fig. 9:15 for rim profile and body carination only). Note the similar rim profile and stance of the Level 1 biconical jar in</page><page sequence="159">1994 TELL DOTHAN: THE WESTERN CEMETERY 159 V?* ***.- Fig. 15. This second photograph in the sequence depicts the progress of excavations down to Level 4, looking east. Al? though filled with stones, the full extent of rock-hewn Crypt F is now visible in the upper left. Crypt H, the rock-hewn loculus in the extreme eastern end of the chamber, is discemible in the upper right, though blocked with stones. Just be? low Crypt H, the stone wall of Crypt G is clearly visible. Rock-hewn Crypt E, on the southern side of the eastern end of the tomb, is visible in the upper right. fig. 20:3, though the body carination is higher and slightly less sharp. Level 4 rim profiles vary (fig. 32:8,9; 33:1), though few examples of the rectangu? lar and triangular grooved rims were found in that level (Loud 1948: pls. 58:3 [32:8 here]; 63:7 [33:1 here]; Yadin 1960: pl. 134:11 [32:8 here]). Flat and shallow-to-moderate disk bases are attested in all levels. As a general impression, the body carination that characterizes this vessel type tends to be more pronounced in Levels 3 to 5 (cf. figs. 20:1,2,7; 25:2-6 [Levels 1 and 2] with figs. 29:1-6; 32:8,9; 33:1,2 [Levels 3 and 4]). There is consistency through all levels of the tomb in terms of point of handle attachment. Biconicals with one or two han? dles are documented in all levels. The biconical spouted vessel with basket handle shows little change through the tomb levels (figs. 20:6, 33:2). Lamps. Tomb 1 produced nearly 600 lamps, with significant numbers in each level of the tomb. The distribution is fairly uniform in Levels 1, 3, and 4, but with significantly higher numbers in Level 2 and slightly lower numbers in Level 5. The characteristic MB II-LB I lamp with slightly pinched mouth is not attested. The lamps of Level 5 are closer to the typical LB II form: sharply pinched mouth; and shallow to moderately deep bowl and definite rim, though many lamps are without a rim. The lamps of Levels 2 to 4 are quite uniform in these basic typological features. Figure 26:7 depicts the most common Level 2 form; the lamp of fig. 31:6 is typical of Level 3; and fig. 34:1 preserves the characteristic features of the Level 4 horizon. Although not depicted in the plates, minor variations are attested. Figure 26:9 is unusual in</page><page sequence="160">160 ROBERT E. COOLEY AND GARY D. PRATICO AASOR 52 Fig. 16. Level 5, the earliest stratum in the tomb, looking east. Crypts F, G, H, and E are clearly visible. the repertoire of Levels 2 to 4. By way of compari? son with the lamps of Levels 1 and 5, the forms of Levels 2 to 4 have deeper bowls and more sharply pinched mouths. Many examples are attested in which the pinch almost closes the folded-over flaps, and most lamps have a definite rim. The typical lamp of Levels 2 to 4 preserves the basic typological features of the form in LB II. Lamp typology for these levels of Tomb 1 appears to be uniform, with no typological distinctions discern- ible. Level 1 lamps appear to fall into two catego? ries: a smaller lamp with definite rim, moderately deep bowl, and a slightly less pronounced pinch in the mouth; and a form that preserves the features described above for the form in Levels 2 to 4. In many examples in both categories, the rim tends to be slightly wider than in previous levels. Level 1 lamps have rounded bases. The flat base of Iron I is not attested. Chalices. Chalices are well-attested in all levels of Tomb 1 except Level 5 (figs. 21:1,2; 26:1-5; 30:1-6; 33:3-5; 35:7); and subtle typological dis- tinctives are observable between the levels, espe? cially between Levels 1 and 4. The rims of Level 1 chalices are triangular and inverted, frequently with a pronounced or slight ridge (fig. 21:1,2; cf. Loud 1948: pl. 72:11-13). The triangular rim is occasion? ally elongated, as in fig. 21:2. The flared foot is common in early Iron I (Guy 1938: pls. 8:3; 16:9,10; 19:17; 71:17). The ridge continues into Level 2 forms (fig. 26:2,3; Loud 1948: pl. 67:5 for the former), with as many rims evidencing a slight to pronounced groove (fig. 26:4-6). The triangular rims of this level are both inverted (fig. 26:6) and everted (fig. 26:5). Figure 26:1 represents a slight variation in the profile of the ridged rim (cf. Yadin 1960: pl. 118:24), though the stepped foot is attested in chalices of early Iron I (Guy 1938:</page><page sequence="161">1994 TELL DOTHAN: THE WESTERN CEMETERY 161 pl. 8:14). The inverted, triangular grooved rim is the most common profile in Level 3, and the groove is usually pronounced (fig. 30:4,5; Guy 1938: pls. 16:9; 19:17; Yadin 1960: pl. 141:20). Everted rims with groove are also attested in this level (fig. 30:3,6), as are triangular ridged rims (30:1). The chalices of Level 4 perpetuate the rim profiles of the previous level (fig. 33:3-5), though more pro? nounced. Level 5 produced only six chalices, one with the unusual profile of fig. 35:7. The chalice base in Levels 1 to 3 evidences several forms; straight (figs. 21:1; 26:2; 30:5), and slightly to moderately stepped or flared (figs. 21:2; 26:3,4,6; 30:2,3). The chalices of Level 4 have a more pronounced flare (fig. 33:3-5; cf. fig. 35:7). Unusual base profiles are represented by the forms of fig. 26:1,5. Each level yielded forms with shal? low and deep bowls, as well as low and high bases. Krater-mugs. The so-called krater-mug (figs. 21:3; 31:1-3, 33:6-7) is attested in small numbers in Levels 3 and 4 of Tomb 1 (less than 15 examples in each level), with one to three examples each in Levels 1, 2, and 5. In Levels 3 and 4, the form is quite uniform in appearance (cf. the Level 3 forms of fig. 31:1-3 with the Level 4 examples of 33:6,7). The only variations in evidence for the krater-mugs of these two levels are the sharpness of the body carination and the type of base, though flat and disk bases are attested in both levels. With the exception of the rim in fig. 21:6, this Level 1 example is very close to the krater-mugs of earlier levels. Precise parallels are unknown, though cer? tain features (such as the pronounced body carina? tion and the high vertical rim) are reminiscent of similar features on other vessel types from the MB II, Late Bronze, and early Iron Ages, as well as local imitations of Late Bronze Cypriot imports (Guy 1938: pls. 31:4; 32:22,23; 34:8,10; 59:8; 60:35; 64:34,35; 68:3; 70:12-17; 71:1; 73:3; Yadin 1960: pl. 116:11). Multihandled Kraters, Stirrup Jars, and Flasks. Tomb 1 produced a remarkable assemblage of multi? handled kraters, of which only a small selection has been presented in the pottery plates. It must be em- phasized that the forms depicted in the plates are not predominant types, nor are they representative for the levels in which they are attested. The major? ity of the multihandled kraters and some of the most interesting forms were uncovered in the later levels of the tomb. The kraters of figs. 21:6; 22:1- 3; and 23:1,2 are from Level 1; those depicted in 27:1-3 are from Level 2. The vessel pictured in fig. 34:5 is from Level 4. Level 1 kraters have numer? ous parallels in Iron I (Guy 1938: pls. 8:9 [22:1 here]; 68:16 [22:2 here]; 70:13; 73:3 [22:3 here, with fenestrated pedestal]; 70:15 [23:1 here]; Loud 1948: pl. 69:14. For Level 2, multihandled kraters, see Guy 1938: pl. 68:3 [27:1 here]; 68:16 [27:3 here]); McGovern 1986: fig. 51:24,25,27,28. The final report will provide a detailed study of this im? portant and unique vessel type. Tomb 1 yielded fewer than ten stirrup jars, the majority from Levels 3 and 4 (figs. 30:7, 34:4, re? spectively). The closest parallels come from Late Bronze II contexts, and included several from Late Bronze IIB, the period of Mycenaean IIIB (for par? allels to the Level 3 stirrup jars, see Pritchard 1980: fig. 10:3; 53:10; Guy 1938: pls. 14:7; 34:22; Yadin 1960: pl. 137:11,12; Baramki 1959: 133:5,8,10,11; p. 135:14,15,21 [though the Sarepta imports are more angular in body profile]; for Level 4, see Pritchard 1980: figs. 13:6,7; 21:10; Loud 1948: pl. 62:9; Han? key 1974: 139, fig. 7:81-83). The ring flask of fig. 30:8 (and several other closed-form flasks of Level 3) find many close parallels in Late Bronze IIB contexts: Lachish (Tufnell 1958: pl. 84:955); Megiddo (Guy 1938: pl. 14:6; 34:13); Tell es-Sacidiyeh (Pritchard 1980: figs. 12:2; 13:9; 18:2); Tell el-Farcah (de Vaux 1951: 570, fig. 3:6); Hazor (Yadin 1960: pl. 130:8-13); Gibeon (Pritchard 1963: fig. 8:25); Beth Shean (Oren 1973: pls. 50:3; 48b:32; 44b:31); Sa? repta (Baramki 1959: 137:27-29,31). Figures 19-35 and the accompanying prelimi? nary observations only begin to explore the incred- ible wealth of this tomb's pottery traditions. The combination of a clearly stratified burial context in five levels and nearly three thousand vessels holds great promise for the study of pottery typology for the period in which the western cemetery was in use at Dothan. Based on the pottery and other ma? terial remains, the following chronology is sug? gested for the five levels of Tomb 1: Level 5 Late Bronze IIA (1400-1300 b.ce.). The tomb consisted of the central chamber with the shaft measuring 0.90 x 1.45 m. Remains of this earliest level were re- stricted to an area in the back of the tomb chamber. Level 4 Late Bronze IIA (1400-1300 b.ce.). The chronology of this and the earliest level are established on the basis of both</page><page sequence="162">162 ROBERT E. COOLEY AND GARY D. PRATICO AASOR 52 domestic and imported pottery (Cypriot and Mycenean wares). Burials occupied the entire chamber in Level 4. Level 3 Late Bronze IIB (1300-1200 b.c.e.), though some LB IIA forms are still at? tested in this level. The tomb was en? larged by the addition of crypts. Level 2 This level evidences a mixture of Late Bronze IIB and Early Iron I domestic pottery. Level 1 Early Iron I (1200-1100 b.c.e.). As noted above, diagnostic Iron I pottery was discovered in this latest level. No Iron II pottery was present. The shaft was widened from 0.90 x 1.45 m to 1.25 by 1.45 m with a depth of 1.00 m. The blocking stone fit into the reworked shaft and rested on large stones that were placed on the shaft steps below. Although some chronological refinement for the individual levels is possible in the final publication of the western cemetery, Tomb 1 dates between the 14th and 12th centuries b.c.e. Other Tomb 1 Deposits. Several unique depos? its are worthy of note: three seven-spouted lamps (Free 1960: 14); a simply decorated kernos ring with free communication between the ring and the seven spouts; five zoomorphic vessels, each fash- ioned in the shape of a bull with sexual attributes clearly represented; a bronze lamp manufactured in identical form to its ceramic counterparts; and a collection of 25 scarabs. Imported Mycenaean and Cypriot wares are represented among the burial vessels. The tomb also yielded bronze weaponry (daggers, spearheads, and various projectiles), a collection of 39 bronze bowls, and a complete faience bowl with painted lines on the bottom of the vessel. Other deposits included an alabaster chalice, basalt vessels, limestone platters, grinding stones, spindles, whorls, and jewelry (bracelets, necklaces, finger rings, toggle pins, beads, and pins). Two ivory pendants, fashioned in the shape of a mallet or hammer, were discovered on the chest area of two skeletons. Very few remnants of the food offerings survived. Olive pits, sheep bones, shellfish remains, and a fish vertebra were among the few discoveries. As would be expected in a muftiple burial tomb, the level of disturbance made it very difficult to associate deposits with individual burials, except Table 3. Personal Ornaments found in Tomb 1 Table 4. Weapons found in Tomb 1 Table 5. Amulets and Ritual Objects Found in Tomb 1 for the interment in Crypt H (fig. 12). The deposits associated with this burial included seven pot? tery vessels and one clam shell. A dipper juglet and an oversize flask were placed at the head of the skeleton, presumably to quench the thirst of the deceased. A medium-sized bowl, rounded-bottom juglet, jug, pot, and a Cypriot bowl were placed at the feet. The clam shell was associated with this latter group. No personal adornments, implements, weapons, or ritual objects were included in the burial assemblage.

Flora and Fauna Found in Tomb 1 Tomb Levels Total flora and fauna Table 7. Implements Found in Tomb 1 Table 8. Miscellaneous Deposits Found in Tomb 1 Tomb 1 is one of the largest and richest multi- ple burial tombs discovered to date in the Levant. As will be detailed below, only Megiddo, She? chem, Lachish, and Tell el-cAjjul have yielded burial contexts comparable in size, tomb construc? tion, or wealth of finds. Figurine Lamp (figs. 17a-c, 18a-d). Num? bered among the rich artifact finds of Tomb 1 was an anthropomorphic lamp of unique design and significance (Reg. No. T1-2010-P1344; see figures 17a-c and 18a-d). The lamp is likely wheelmade, though only ra- diographic imaging will provide a definite determi- nation. The interior surface shows traces of wheel finishing by smoothing of the surface with a rotary movement. The clay is composed of several types of aplastic inclusions (including small fragments of calcite or gypsum with medium to coarse lime? stone and sandstone inclusions well distributed) and an organic material that has burned out. The hardness of the clay (MOHS 4) suggests a firing temperature above 700? C. The lack of evidence of extreme vitrification in the body indicates a firing temperature below 1000? C and probably below 900? C. No refiring tests, microstructure evaluations, or radiographic imaging were conducted. These con? clusions are based on visual and low-power optical microscopy. The vessel has a sharply pinched spout. The fold of the spout is so pronounced that it encom- passes half of the lamp form. The reservoir of the lamp has an exterior depth of nearly 6 cm (bottom exterior to the tip of the figure's head) with an inte? rior depth of 3.7 cm. The form has a definite rim with the appearance of a slight base, though the body features of the applied figure may simply cre- ate the impression of a base. No traces of burning are evident. As is typical of many Tomb 1 vessels, this buff-colored lamp is of relatively poor manu- facturing quality. The molded and applied human figure makes this lamp unique to the Dothan pottery assemblage. The applied human form extends from a point be? yond the tip of the spout to the start of the slightly flaring rim. The figure's overall length is approxi? mately 16 cm. The head extends 2 cm beyond the tip of the spout and is 3 cm wide x 4 cm high. Five clay globulets, applied high on the forehead and extending ear to ear, create the impression of a coiffure or some type of head adornment. The skull terminates in a pointed ridge, 1 cm higher than the uppermost globulet. The ears are created by elon? gated globulets of clay. The right ear is 1.4 cm long; the left is 1.2 cm. The nose is prominent (1.5 cm in length), flar? ing slightly from the sloping forehead. The eyes were created by pushing excess clay upward, form- ing a rounded depression. The lips consist of two thin coils of applied clay 1.3 cm in width by 0.7 cm thick). The arms (each 7.5 cm long) were created by applying a small coil of clay along the bottom fold of the pinched spout. The ends of the arms are splayed, with no hands or fingers distin- guishable. The legs are rather short in relation to the body (5.5 cm to 6.0 cm long). Similar to the</page><page sequence="164">164 ROBERT E. COOLEY AND GARY D. PRATICO AASOR 52 Fig. 17.

The feet are also splayed with no toe features discernible. The figure exhibits a two- directional stance. The feet are molded in a left to right stance, whereas the body and head are ap? plied in a frontal stance. No gender characteristics are evident.

Several imprints of the sculp- tor's fingers indicate that the clay was quite wet during the application of the figure to the bottom of the vessel. Skeletal Remains. Although skulls were better preserved in Levels 3 to 5, the skeletal remains in all levels of this tomb were very fragmentary and in a state of complete disorder, often fused in lime? stone. The poorer state of preservation of the skele? tal remains, especially the skulls in Levels 1 and 2, may be explained by the damage incurred when the</page><page sequence="166">166 ROBERT E. COOLEY AND GARY D. PRATICO AASOR 52 tomb ceiling collapsed. The five levels yielded a total of 204 skulls: 47 fragmentary skulls in Level 1; 57 fragmentary and 9 complete skulls in Level 2 (one infant skeleton was discovered); 22 fragmen? tary and 26 complete skulls in Level 3; 3 frag? mentary and 30 complete skulls in Level 4; and, in Level 5, 3 fragmentary and 7 complete skulls. Based on these and other skeletal remains, it has been estimated that Tomb 1 contained between 250 and 300 skeletons. OBSERVATIONS ON TOMB 1 MORTUARY PRACTICE The following observations are advanced re? garding the reconstruction of Tomb 1 burial ritual. Upon the death of a family member, the body was taken to the ancestral tomb in the limestone escarp? ment on the western side of the settlement. The bones of earlier burials were unceremoniously swept to the sides of the chamber, thereby provid- ing space for the new interment. The body was then placed on the floor of the chamber or on the debris of earlier burials, either in an extended or full-length position without regard to a fixed orien? tation. No evidence for contracted positioning was discerned. Numerous burials were documented in which the skeletal remains were covered with the body sherds of large storage jars. Vessels, furnish? ings, and personal possessions were either placed around the circumference of the tomb or carefully arranged around the body. The deposits appear to represent a full complement of everyday articles that presumably would provide the deceased with the necessary material needs in the afterlife. Food and drink were included in the deposits, and the presence of clay lamps in large numbers suggests the importance of light. Following interment, the doorway to the chamber was closed with the block? ing stone. The shaft was then filled with debris. When a second death in the family occurred and the tomb was to be used again, the debris in the shaft and then the blocking stone were removed, and the corpse and its deposits were placed in the chamber. As before, the previous burials and de? posits were brushed aside to make room for the new interment with its adornments. As noted above, the practice of multiple succes? sive burials resulted in significant destruction to the skeletal remains. In many instances, the skele? tal remains were fused into a solid mass, making it difficult to study the components of the individual interment. The few burials that had not suffered destruction indicate that full-length or extended po- sitioning was preferred. Tibia and fibula bones were in an excellent state of preservation. Some were stacked like cordwood; though most were scattered throughout the burial debris. Several inferences may be drawn from the study of Tomb 1 mortuary practices relating to such is- sues as the treatment of the body, the nature of the tomb as a temporary residence, and the signifi- cance of the burial deposits. The evidence suggests that there existed a contrast in attitude regarding the corpse between the time of interment and its later treatment after the decomposition of the flesh. At the time of burial, scrupulous care was exer- cised in the placement of the corpse and in the ar? rangement of the burial deposits. Once the body was transformed into a pile of bones, it was treated with little respect. It was normal practice to sweep aside the bones and deposits into a heap, often de- stroying both in the process to make room for sub? sequent burials. Apparently it was believed that the deceased was conscious of feeling and in need of sustenance as long as the flesh had not completely decomposed. With the decomposition of the flesh, however, the descendants could with impunity de- stroy or perhaps even remove certain of the burial deposits. The tomb was not considered the perma- nent residence of the dead, but only a temporary station on the way to the netherworld. There is no evidence that burials deposits were renewed peri- odically, nor were additional supplies placed in the tombs in the years that followed interment (see Cooley 1968: 80-188; 1983 for further study of Tomb 1 mortuary practices). SUMMARY OBSERVATIONS ON TOMB 1 IN THE CONTEXT OF EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN BURIAL PRACTICES Based on clearly prescribed burial characteris? tics, a recent study by Gonen discerns two distinct groups of burials of the Late Bronze Age in Canaan: pit burials for individual interment and cave burials for multiple interment (Gonen 1992: 9-31). Both burial types are regarded as indige- nous to Canaan, having been practiced since the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age. Gonen fur? ther distinguishes another indigenous burial prac? tice characterized by intramural interment. The study concludes with a presentation of eight for? eign burial types that originated in different places</page><page sequence="167">1994 TELL DOTHAN: THE WESTERN CEMETERY 167 and arrived in Canaan during different phases of the Late Bronze Age: bench burial caves; loculi burial caves; bilobate burial caves; open pits; struc? tural chambers; and larnax, coffin, and jar burials. Tell Dothan's Tomb 1 clearly falls within the gen? eral category of cave burials for multiple inter- ments and shares the specific characteristics of the loculi burial caves. Unlike those burials that used natural caves (such as Tell Jedur and Khirbet Rabud), or those that reused Early or Middle Bronze Age burial sites (Tel Regev, Beth-shean, Gibeon, Jericho, Tell el-Farcah [N], and certain ones at Gezer and Megiddo), Tell Dothan's Tomb 1 was a newly con? structed burial site of the Late Bronze Age. How? ever, Tomb 3 was a nearby burial cave that was originally used as a cistern. As Gonen has cor- rectly observed, a typology of Late Bronze Age tombs is impossible to establish at the present time and probably for the immediate future as well. Like most multiple burial caves of the Late Bronze Age, Tomb 1 was located outside of the settlement's fortifications on the western slopes of the mound. Other burial chambers located on the slopes of the mound are known from Megiddo, La? chish, Tell Jedur, Tell Beit Mirsim, and Beth- shemesh. While many settlements have only one associated burial cave, this tomb was part of a cemetery that consisted of three burial caves. Un? fortunately, Tombs 2 and 3 were not well-preserved by comparison, though roughly contemporary (on the later side) with Tomb 1. Nevertheless, there is no clear tomb organization in the western cemetery, consistent with Gonen's observation that the posi- tioning of Late Bronze Age burial caves in relation to associated settlements is irrelevant. Again, consistent with the majority of Late Bronze Age cave burials, Tomb 1 was used for multiple interments, with the well-known Middle Bronze II practice of removing old bones to the sides of the chamber to make room for new buri? als. This practice is well documented at Jericho, Megiddo, Beth-Shean, Gibeon, and Safed. The number of interments in multiple burial tombs var- ies from a handful, though this circumstance is relatively infrequent, to the numbers represented in Tell Dothan's largest burial chamber. The types and numbers of funerary objects detailed above are quite characteristic of the larger Late Bronze Age burial caves. Pottery vessels of various types, mostly local, represent the largest class of funerary deposits. Approximately five percent of the Tomb 1 assemblage is imported. This datum, too, is con- sistent with the typical multiple burial cave of this period. While Tomb 1 shares the general characteristics of cave burials for multiple interments, Gonen classifies this tomb among the categories of for? eign burials, specifically caves with loculi burials (Gonen 1992: 132-33). As is clear in the accompa- nying plan, Tomb 1 had six rock-hewn and two constructed crypts or loculi. Similar roughly con? temporary tomb constructions are known from Tell el-cAjjul (Petrie 1931: 127, pl. 57, fig. 6; pl. 54); Lachish (Tufnell 1953: pl. 128; 1958: 228, 240, 280-87); and Megiddo (Guy 1938: 127, 129; pls. 41, 42, 140, 141). Though some would suggest a slightly earlier chronology, the typical tomb with loculi was introduced at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. This burial design obviously was in- tended for individual burials but in the context of the group, often the family. While noting that loculi burial caves in Canaan display hybrid features of Greek and Cypriot ori? gin, Gonen finds the parallels closer to Cypriot models, where the design was common, beginning with the Early Cypriot period (Gonen 1992: 24- 25). She studies Tumulus #7 at Paleoskutela in the center of the Karpas Peninsula as representative of the Cypriot loculi burial cave (Sjokvist 1940: fig. 45:10; Gjerstad 1934: 427-38). The parallels be? tween this tomb construction and that of Tell Do- than's Tomb 1 are striking. The burial chamber of the Cypriot example is roughly circular, with four loculi cut into the walls. Access to the burial chamber was achieved by means of a well-cut shaft with three steps that opened into a stomion. A blocking stone was located at the entrance to the tomb chamber. Seven skeletons were found in the four loculi, two burials in each of three loculi, and an individual burial in the fourth. Seven additional burials were discovered on the floor of the tomb chamber. Although the number of burials in the Tell Dothan tomb is significantly larger, the paral? lels in tomb construction are instructive. BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO TOMBS 2 AND 3 Tombs 2 and 3 also were discovered in Area K, the former during the 1962 season and the latter in 1964. The construction of both tombs involved the reuse of cisterns that had been quarried into the soft limestone. Neither tomb was as well preserved as Tomb 1, and neither evidenced the stratification of</page><page sequence="168">168 ROBERT E. COOLEY AND GARY D. PRATICO AASOR 52 the latter. In both instances, the complete architec? tural definition of the tomb complex was lost to later quarrying, which also resulted in extensive damage to tomb deposits. Although Tomb 1 is the primary focus of this article, a few details will be presented for Tombs 2 and 3, since these burial contexts com? plete the picture of the western cemetery. Tomb 2 was a small shaft-type tomb con? structed in Area K-23 (just southwest of Tomb 1), an area originally used for cisterns. Cistern D was used as the shaft for Tomb 2. It was elliptical, 1.40 m (north-south) x 1.60 m (east-west). The depth of this cistern shaft was 1.30 m. In its east? ern side an opening was cut to serve as the en? trance into the chamber of Tomb 2. Cisterns B (1.50 m x 1.05 m with a depth of 1.25 m) and C (1.47 m x 1.56 m with a depth of 2.20 m) were contiguous with the cistern shaft (Cistern D) on its southern side. Cistern E (1.70 m x 1.90 m with a depth of 2.00 m) was located just north of the cis? tern shaft, though not contiguous with it. This cis? tern, however, did adjoin the chamber wall of Tomb 2. The chamber of Tomb 2 was basically rectangular, with rounded corners measuring ap? proximately 5.50 m x 4.0 m. Five crypts were lo? cated around the chamber's northern, eastern, and southern sides. Tomb 2 skeletal remains are extremely frag? mentary. Some 500 objects, including sherds, were registered from this tomb and cistern complex, suggesting chronological horizons similar to these of Tomb 1. Tomb 3 was discovered some 35 m west-south- west of Tomb 1. Originally, this area also was used for cisterns. Three intact cisterns, labeled A, B, and C, were completely excavated during the 1964 season and another (D) was partially cleared. When Cistern B no longer functioned in that capacity, the chamber was utilized as a tomb. This bell-shaped cistern-tomb (Tomb 3), with rounded bottom, mea? sured 1.80 m (north-south) x 1.70 m (east-west). The maximum depth of the tomb chamber was 1.60 m. The soft limestone into which the cistern-tomb had been cut was quarried at a later time, resulting in extensive damage to the chamber and its con- tents. Most of the pottery was broken and widely scattered over the area of the tomb. The skeletal remains were in similar disarray. Despite the level of disturbance, there was no evidence of stratifica? tion as in Tomb 1. Only one level of burials was distinguished. Tomb 3 yielded 89 vessels in the following categories: lamps (12), juglets (27), chalices (11), jugs (28), bowls (9), jar (1), and pyxis (1). The handful of bronze objects included a knife handle with rivets and two rings. Also noteworthy was a small assortment of beads. The skeletal remains were extremely fragmentary, including two skull fragments and teeth from an adult and an infant. The lack of data precludes observations on burial orientation or positioning. The pottery indicates that the chronological ho- rizons of this tomb correspond to the later levels of Tomb 1. Several examples of the diagnostic Iron I lamps and black dipper juglets with bulbous body were present, as well as vessels with wheel bur? nishing on the inside and outside. There are no in- dications of continued usage in the Iron II period. CONCLUSION Archaeological investigation at numerous sites throughout the Levant has yielded abundant data concerning burials and burial rituals (for summa- ries, see Gonen 1987; 1992; Bloch-Smith 1992; Abercrombie 1979; Meyers 1970; Rahmani 1981). The nonepigraphic data of archaeology are hardly sufflcient, however, for an understanding of death, death rituals, and the theological and sociological inferences of mortuary practice. The archaeologi? cal data must be viewed in light of the literary evi? dence; and here too, the horizons of our knowledge have been expanded through discovery of pertinent epigraphic evidence, notably the Ugaritic texts, among other sources (Lewis 1989; Tromp 1969; Healey 1977). The final publication of Tell Do- than's western cemetery will provide a wealth of information for numerous areas of research in bib? lical, archaeological, and ancient Near Eastern studies, especially the study of death and burial rit? uals in the world of Canaanite-Hebrew culture.
