<plain_text><page sequence="1">The The Religion of Jesus the Jew. By Geza Vermes. Pp. χ+ 244. London: SCM Press, 1993. ISBN 033402293 2 £12.50. In this, the last of a trilogy of books devoted to Jesus, Vermes claims him for Judaism, presenting him as a charismatic healer teacher-prophet, a supreme type of the Galilean hasid, who taught an eschatologically charged religion of the heart. Based on Torah, Jesus' religion was concerned not so much with the finer points of interpretation of the Law's precepts, nor with temple worship, but with the ethical values that lie at the heart of Torah: repent ance, faithfulness, simplicity, and devotion. He died tragically, however, his hope of the imminent final manifestation of the Kingdom disappointed. His followers convinced themselves that he lived on and inaugurated a movement which, while still pre serving 'fundamental elements of his piety', was in 'form, purpose and orientation' (p. 214) not to be derived historically from Jesus' religion. Just as Leo Baeck reacted to Adolf von Harnack's distortion of Judaism in The Essence of Christianity with The Essence of Judaism,</page><page sequence="2">202 REVIEWS Vermes has now responded to the tradition of arguing historic ally for the identity of Christianity with Jesus' religion, of which Harnack's book and Dodd's The Founder of Christianity are prime examples, by attempting to place Jesus firmly within Judaism. Of course such historical strategies of claiming Jesus for one's own tradition have their difficulties. Our picture of Judaism in the first century is constantly changing, as is our picture of Jesus. Vermes on the whole comes close to agreeing broadly with liberal studies of Jesus; the main thrust of his argument is that such a Jesus is wholly incompatible with the Christian orthodoxy which claimed him for its own but fits easily into the history of Jewish religious belief from the Old Testament to rabbinic Judaism. How far does such a Jesus find a place within the religion of the Second Temple period? What then is the main drift of his argument? Jesus, we are told, was a 'charismatic healer-teacher-prophet' (p. 6), not a rabbi. In this Vermes claims agreement with Martin Hengel and E.P. Sanders. Jesus taught and did nothing that was contrary to the Law. Vermes attributes to him the Q saying Luke 16:17; disputes that the sabbath controversies were of any real seriousness (Jesus' actions do not constitute 'work' in any significant sense); dismisses Mark 7: 15 as inauthentic; sees the antitheses as 'reinforcing' and 'protecting' Torah (p. 32) and Jesus' commands to love one's enemies, in terms strongly reminiscent of Rudolf Bultmann, as an opportunity 'for the demonstration of ... unselfish, and as it were superhuman, goodness' (p. 37). Jesus however is not greatly concerned with the details of Torah exegesis; he does evince an 'all-pervading concern with the ultimate purpose of Law which he perceives primarily and essentially and positively not as a juridical but as a religious-ethical reality, revealing what he thought to be the right and divinely ordained behaviour towards men and towards God' (p. 45). Though concerned with the ulti mate purpose of Torah, Jesus' teaching authority was not princip ally based on his appeal to and use of scripture, but was a charismatic authority as evidenced by Mark 1: 21 f., where it is specifically contrasted with that of the scribes. In Palestinian Jewish parlance he was a prophet. 'Such a divine messenger had no need to verify his utterances by suitable biblical proof-texts. His personality, his presence, the power of his voice, his awe inspiring reputation as a wonder-worker, ensured that his words were accepted' (pp. 73 f.). His teaching, then, is contained principally in sayings and par ables. His sayings are broadly in a tradition subsequently taken</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 203 up by the rabbis, and encouraged repentance, trust, and renunci ation of wealth. Similarly his parables belong to a tradition which reaches back into the Old Testament and on into the rabbinic literature. However, by contrast with the parables in rabbinic literature, Jesus' parables are eschatological rather than exegetical: they speak of repentance, trust in God and 'the superlative form of this trust, entailing the taking of high risks for the sake of the Kingdom' (p. 117). In this Vermes comes close to Dodd in his reading of the parables. He takes a more sanguine view of the authenticity of the proverbial material in the gospels than Bultmann, but gives it a broadly eschatological interpretation— not so eschatological, however, that it cannot be detached from Jesus' millenarian expectations and given to the world. What then of Jesus' preaching of the Kingdom of God? How does it fit into the development of Jewish beliefs? Vermes gives us a summary of Old Testament and intertestamental beliefs about the Kingdom. Initially the Kingdom of God was the 'celestial counterpart of the earthly kingship'. The period after the exile saw the rise of biblical messianism which looked forward to the violent overthrow of God's enemies and the re-establishment of his Kingdom. Most of the literature of the later Old Testament and intertestamental period betrays this hope for a final defeat of Israel's enemies. Isaiah 40-66 however is 'the source of the con cept of a non-bellicose inauguration of the universal kingdom' (p. 123). This is odd when the passages quoted speak of the Gentiles coming in chains and licking the dust of Israel's feet. One would have liked further documentation of this non-bellicose use. It is certainly not provided by Psalms of Solomon or 1QM, while the rabbinic sources quoted are, perhaps not unsurprisingly, discreet about the manner in which the 'uprooting of the kingdom of wickedness' (Pes. R., ed. Buber, 51a, quoted p. 131) will occur. This is a not unimportant point for, if such a use cannot be documented, then of course Jesus would stand out more sharply from his contemporaries. Rabbinic literature, Vermes continues, is much concerned with the question of how individuals are to relate to God's Kingdom and sees in the Shema' 'positively, an acknowledgement of God's sovereignty ... negatively a rejection of idolatry' (p. 133). Such recognition of God's sovereignty has 'logical and chronological priority over the fulfilment of the individual precepts of the Torah' (ibid.). The implication seems to be that the rabbis, like Jesus, stress trust and obedience to God as the heart of the Jewish religion, while seeing the detailed implementation of</page><page sequence="4">204 REVIEWS Torah as a matter to be addressed only when such trust is already assured. Turning specifically to Jesus' concept of the Kingdom, Vermes again focuses on his treatment of 'man's attitude and behaviour towards the Kingdom' rather than on its 'essence and structure' (Ρ· 137)· This echoes Jesus' own emphasis which is unsurprising in an 'existential teacher' (ibid.). Some parables do, it is true, focus on the manner of its coming: the 'evolution which takes the Kingdom of God from latency to full revelation'; it is a 'paradox ical growth' (ibid.) which requires human collaboration, and whose end is imminent. 'Its prompt establishment is to be achieved by the already familiar teshuvah' (p. 139). Yet Jesus' healings show the divine victory over the forces of evil which has been won (p. 140). With the emergence of Jesus and the 'excited Jewish crowds elbowing their way' (p. 140) towards him (cf. Matt. 11:12!), the Kingdom of God is already present. Nevertheless, despite these sayings about the nature of the Kingdom's coming, the emphasis is on the human response: renunciation of possessions, poverty, the simplicity of mind, the unreserved devotion which are essential conditions of 'submission to the sovereignty of God'. It is as an existential teacher of an 'inner attitude of mind' (p. 143) that Jesus is of permanent importance. Thus Jesus' teaching stands out distinctively within the devel opment of Jewish eschatological thinking. Vermes notes 'the total absence of one of the most distinctive features of the biblical and intertestamental doctrine of the divine Kingdom ... gone are the bloody eschatological battles led by a warrior God'. True 'certain non-bellicose ideas reminiscent of Jesus' outlook ... appear in Jubilees and the Testament of Benjamin; but the similarities are few and far between' (p. 149). Jesus' 'perspective is closer to the Kingdom notion held by the Tannaitic rabbis. The cosmic view ... is reduced to a more manageable, individual size' (p. 149). The spiritual attitude of subordination to God's sovereignty followed by observation of the commandments found in the rabbis, is echoed by Jesus, most remarkably in his use of the Shema' (cf. m.Ber.m.Ber. 2.2. with Mark 12: 29-31). Since it would be 'plain silly' to suppose that the Mishnah was dependent on Jesus, the only logical inference is that 'both derive from a common stream of religious tradition' from the first century ad. Nevertherless, the common ground between Jesus and Tannaitic thinking is limited. Jesus' teaching is 'a substantially fresh creation bearing the stamp of individual eschatology, both quietly concealed and spectacularly climactic' (p. 150).</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 205 Finally, Vermes turns to Jesus' teaching on the fatherhood of God. Jesus emphasizes (like the Galilean hasids) the forgiveness and providential care of the creator God, who elsewhere was often conceived of as an awesome, transcendent 'King-Judge-Ruler' (p. 179). These two elements stand in tension. 'Before the tran scendent majesty of a divine Judge [who] was foreseen as following the coming Day of the Lord, Jesus and his co-workers in the establishment of the Kingdom turned for inspiration, help and strength of purpose to the heavenly Abba' (p. 180). Behind this vision of a Father God, lies not 'a sentimentally anthropomorphic image' of God, but 'the conviction that the eternal, distant, domin ating and tremendous Creator is also and primarily a near and approachable God' (ibid.). Thus Jesus' religion emerges as an eschatologically fired religion of the heart. It is remarkable how closely in this claim Vermes echoes Rudolf Bultmann's Jesus and the Word. Perhaps nowhere more closely than in his insistence that Jesus' eschatological enthu siasm leads straight to an individual perspective: 'Unlike the reli gious vision which takes the future for granted and envisages life in a solidly established group context, eschatological ardour demands a complete break with the past, exclusively concentrates on the present moment, and does so not from a communal but from a personal perspective' (p. 191). The question for him must be how far the adoption of such a personal perspective ultimately separates Jesus from any religious tradition 'which envisages life in a solidly established group context' (whether this be pre- or post-70 Judaism or indeed the various forms of Catholic Christianity). Bultmann's individualistic portrayal of Jesus sits relatively happily with the individualization and privatization of religion that has occurred widely in European Protestantism. Vermes seems to welcome it too. 'Jesus' underlying message is that every man devoting himself to a whole-hearted search for God's Kingdom is essentially alone' (p. 192). This is said in the context of a discussion of repentance, which is an aspect of the synoptic tradition that Vermes confidently attributes to Jesus, though there are difficulties here: the repent ance sayings are not by any means as widely attested as one would expect, and Jesus' meals with tax-collectors and sinners suggest an openness to people in flagrant breach of the Law which is not consistent with a prior requirement to repent and make due resti tution according to the Law: sin-offerings and full repayment (compare and contrast Luke's addition to Mark 2: 17). Vermes dismisses the suggestion that this would have been a major concern to people in Galilee: 'for Jesus' Galilean disciples the issue was</page><page sequence="6">206 REVIEWS of scholastic rather than real significance' (p. 192 n. 7), though the temple priests would of course have wanted to insist on the sin offering 'out of class solidarity and self-interest' (ibid.)· Immediately this raises the unspoken issue which those who read this book in the wake of E. P. Sanders' Judaism: practice and belief must constantly have in their minds: how far is the individualistic, non-communal religion of the heart, which Vermes portrays as characteristic of Jesus, compatible with Sanders' common Judaism, centred on the temple cult and sacrifice. Vermes himself registers his strong dissent: in bothj'eius and Judaism and Judaism: practice practice and belief 'the importance of the role of the Temple is, in my judgment, vastly over-estimated' (p. 185 n. 1). He has argued elsewhere that Pharisees were not influential in pre-70 Galilee and is clearly of the view that the Galilean hasids were more represent ative of Galilean Judaism in general. These are complex questions which cannot be debated in a review. The fact remains that Sanders has assembled a formidable body of evidence, not only of the widespread support for the temple but of the growth of interest in purity itself across the country (cf. not least his com ments on immersion pools), which he sees as part of a general zeal for the Law. Vermes' summary of Jesus' religion stands in remarkable contrast: 'Thus the core of Jesus' religion is not Torah observance observance as such—though it is by no means excluded and prompts inner spirituality. It is not a search for purity—ritual or ethical. It is not self-sanctification in the form of a life of prayer and worship—in the temple and synagogue. It seems not even to have been a pursuit of God for his own sake, but by means of devotion to his brethren after the pattern of a merciful, heavenly Father. He goes so far as to suggest that at the Last Judgment, the divine King's sole criterion will be whether or not a person imitated him in his deeds of love' (p. 204). Vermes asserts that he is supported by both Hengel and Sanders in portraying Jesus as a 'charismatic healer-teacher-prophet' (p. 6). But this is seriously misleading. What Sanders actually says in the passage referred to by Vermes is this: 'Jesus is better seen as a charismatic—either (with Vermes) a charismatic healer like Hanina ben Dosa or Honi the Circle Drawer or (with Hengel, Theissen and others) a charismatic prophet. I incline to the second view, but in either case the important point is that a charismatic does not set out to take a stance on a series of legal questions' (JLJM,(JLJM, 3, my italics). Thus Vermes and Sanders agree on the question of Jesus' charismatic stance towards the Law, but disag ree on whether he should be seen as a healer or a prophet. Vermes wants to include teacher in as well, noting as he does that Jesus</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS 207 stands head and shoulders above the Galilean hasids, thanks to the '"sublimity, distinctiveness and originality" of his ethical teaching (Joseph Klausner)' (p. 5). Extremely important issues are, I think, obscured by this blur ring over of the distinction between charismatic healer, teacher, and prophet. In practice, in Vermes' present book Jesus is por trayed almost entirely as an existential teacher: the eschatological aspects of his preaching are not disguised (he believed in an imminent final manifestation of God as King and Judge and was disappointed), but they are related to his teaching of the heart only in so far as they are set within a 'personal perspective' (p. 191). As with Bultmann's existential interpretation, the cosmo logical elements are seen as secondary in importance to the per sonal commitments, true obedience, and trust, though of course unlike with Bultmann these are not contrasted to but compared with rabbinic and Tannaitic understandings of the Law. Such a focus on the ethical aspects of the Law, acknowledgment of God's sovereignty before the observance of its detailed prescriptions is then said to be in line with the teachings of the prophets. Jesus' healings give credence to his words; they and the exorcisms are also signs of God's victory over the dark powers. In this way Vermes extends his understanding of Jesus as charismatic to cover all three categories: healer, teacher, and prophet. But there is a distinction between those who see Jesus primarily as a charismatic after the type of the Galilean hasids and those like Hengel and Theissen who see him as a charismatic prophet. Theissen has, most recently, spelt this out in terms of Jesus' attempt to inaugurate a 'charismatic revolution of value' ('Wertrevolution', NTS 35 (1989), 343-360). Jesus sought to transfer values which had previously been attached to the aristo cracy and the wealthy to the poor and those of low status in Palestinian society. Such a revolution in values is not seen in purely individual terms. It is the transfer of values from one group to another and is to be seen in the context of a wider struggle for the distribution of goods within society. Thus when Jesus encour ages his followers to love their enemies this is not, pace Vermes and Bultmann, simply the supreme invitation to demonstrate one's total obedience to God, but the costly invitation to the poor and militarily weak to appropriate values ascribed to victorious rulers. This, I would want to add, would entail a very different set of group attitudes towards the dominant colonial power, Rome, whether it was ruling directly or through client rulers, to the ones admirably documented by Vermes in his chapter on the Kingdom. On Theissen's view Jesus' advocacy of love of enemies is not part</page><page sequence="8">208 REVIEWS of an individual exhortation to great piety and devotion, but part of an attempt to impart new values to the group. To see Jesus as charismatic prophet, that is to say, is to see him as concerned, in whatever way, with the restoration of Israel, not simply with individual acceptance of God's sovereignty. And the further question this raises is to what extent Jesus as eschatological prophet is concerned to renew and to recast the values of the group. Vermes' book, if nothing else, demonstrates the difficulty of certain lines of historical enquiry which have been the mainstay of liberal protestant apologetic for more than a century. But it also shows the importance of attempting to plot out our different cultural heritages and to understand their interrelationships better. None of us needs reminding of the urgency of such a task. Jews and Christians need to find their common cultural roots and to acknowledge and welcome what they have in common—for our common good. Not the least of the problems with Harnack's and Dodd's books referred to above is that they were both firmly predicated on the superiority of European Protestantism. To appropriate Jesus for their tradition while emphasizing his distinctiveness from Judaism was, of course, a denial of Jewish participation in European cultural traditions, presenting them as an alien force. Such a reading of our history must not be repeated. Vermes' book is thus to be welcomed as a strong attempt to set matters to rights by showing Jesus' place within the development of the biblical tradition into the Tannaitic period. Given the regularity with which Christian scholars have distorted this pic ture, it is perhaps churlish to complain about too sharp a correction in the other direction. Vermes has, after all, maintained remarkable objectivity in documenting the distinctiveness of Jesus' position over against much in the Jewish tradition. But his final section in which he contrasts Jesus' religion with orthodox Christianity, with its origins in Paul and John, ignores the work of liberal historians and theologians from the time of Harnack, who have sought to criticize the hellenization of Christianity and, like Bultmann, to provide an existential reading of Paul and John, as it ignores the work of the last twenty-five years or more of New Testament scholarship which has sought to set not only Jesus but also Paul and John more firmly within their Jewish context and heritage. To allude to these two very different traditions of New Testament studies must serve here to indicate the great complexity of the issues which Vermes raises. John Κ. Riches</page></plain_text>
