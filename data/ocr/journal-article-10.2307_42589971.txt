<plain_text><page sequence="1">141 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT METTAFHOïïtS AIBTID) HETAF1¥SI€S Edward B. Costello University of Missouri at St. Louis This paper is an attempt to establish three points: (1) that every ontological scheme stems from a metaphor, (2) that during the process of making the metaphor become literal, the ontology involved is still open to the contemplation of being, but (3) when the ontology claims tobe both literal and comprehensive, it falls into a category mistake and closes its eyes to being. The term "metaphysics" seems to have two distinct meanings. On the one hand it means an activity in pursuit of being, and on the other hand it means a static system of principles or categories which have captured being once and for all. I should like here to restrict the term "metaphysics" to refer only to the activity and to use the term "ontology" to refer to systems claiming to dé- scribe being. We may say that metaphysics is "the science of be- ing qua being" or "an attempt to know reality as against mere ap- pearance, "1 only if we emphasize that "science" and "attempt" refer to activities. On this view the notion of a final metaphysics becomes absurd. Now some very respectable thinkers have held that afinal meta- physics is possible. I think Kant's position on the matter was that when we have philosophized into existence enough principles, laws and categories, when we have codified and neatly arranged them, metaphysics will be complete. This was the view that Kierkegaard so detested and so cleverly lampooned. I do not know whether the Hegelians deserved the caricature or whether Kierkegaard miscon- ceived their endeavor but if they thought they were building an eternal structure of metaphysics they deserved his jibing inquiry of "is it finished yet?" To wait or to hope for the day metaphysics will be complete is just a shade less foolish than to claim the happy day has already arrived. I think this is what Whitehead meant when ( This paper is a revised version of the Presidential Address given at the nineteenth annual meeting of the Missouri State Philosoph- ical Association. Grateful acknowledgement is accorded the Uni- versity of Missouri, St. Louis, for a research grant, a part of which was used in exploring this topic. )</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 142 he said, " In philosophic discussion, the merest hint of dogmatic certainty as to finality of statement is an exhibition of folly. "2 For present purposes, let us call any system which claims final- ity an ontology rather than a metaphysics. By an ontology I mean a scheme of ideas, laws, principles or categories in terms of which much - but never quite all - of experience can be interpreted and brought to order. I think it would be deceptively optimistic to write a his tory of philosophy as though heaping ontology on top of earlier ontology had any hope of ultimately attaining the final metaphysics. To say, however, that one ontology can engage another, entering a dialectic which reveals some of the truth, is I think rather closer to the way the history of philosophy really goes. I would put it that any worthwhile ontology undergoes a metaphysical moment in which it throws-new light upon being and brings us noticeably closer toit than we were before. When a new ontology is framed, or at least when an individual first tries it as a means of interpreting experi- ence, it forces one to view experience through a new and perhaps even uncongenial set of categories. Just because the categories are new or distasteful, being itself has a better chance of standing in relief. When, on the other hand, the new ontology is accepted and, for one reason or another, becomes as habitual as brute fact, the categories cometo the fore and overshadow the being they hitherto revealed. The categories determine laws and relations which de- mand attention; thinkers work to discover experiential corrobora- tion of, or deductive relations among, the ontology's principles and, before long, proponents of the given ontology are led to claim quite correctly that they do not find being as an element within their ontology at all. Often they express this by saying that they have* no ontology at all but only science or common language. It is at this point of development - or atrophy - that we have Kant's dictum that existence is not a predicate, or more recently J. L. Austin's to the effect that in the pair "real versus not real" it is "not real" that "wears the pants. " And "not real" can have only the various meanings ' which common sense can carefully specify when it takes the trouble to do so. Thus, "she's not a real blonde" means she dyes her hair; "that's not a real duck" means it's a de- coy, and so forth. 3 In much the same way and perhaps with greater right a scientist will turn away from questions of being and non being in favor of his preferred set of principles, methods, canons of evidence, etc., which, of course, he refuses to consideran ontology. It struck me that the career of an ontology is very much like that of a metaphor. Each comes closest to doing the job it was</page><page sequence="3">143 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT designed to do when it has novelty, and each as it becomes stale or hardened gets in its own way and can even obscure the very thing it tries to illuminate. The metaphysical moment an ontology en- joys is paralleled by the clear revelatory moment of a good meta- phor. For each, when it is new brings to the fore some previously unnoticed features. It is at the moment one resists a metaphor and claims it is simply false that one is compelled by curiosity to look to see if it is in any sense true. And when one looks he is forced to abandon his customary view of categories, attributes or selected features and for a little while to contemplate being more nearly face to face. Suppose, for instance, that I subscribe to an ontology, one large Segment of which describes man as a rational animal. Then suppose I hear for the first time that man is a thinking reed. At first I deny this, but then I am forced to look. I notice that no mani know is rational in every respect at all times. I hear from Kurt Baier among others that no one can speak of a reasonable decision to be rational, yet it seems odd to make rationality stem solely from the animal side. In more and more ways I notice that man's ration- ality is like a reed. My faith in my ontology^ literalness and com- pleteness is in question. Man remains in part a rational animal but he is now a good deal more. At that momenti am open to the being of man because I don't constrain it to appear solely as rational animal. I suspect that if someone were to develop the thinking reed metaphor into a full blown ontology, somewhere along the line he would deny it is a metaphor. The move from "man is literally a thinking reed" to "man is- a thinking reed and nothing else" at least SEEMS inevitable. I hope it is not, because with that move we close the door to being and £ocus instead on our categories. But more on this later. Pursuing the notion that a metaphor can be made to function as an ontology, I looked at Stephen Pepper's still valuable book WORLD HYPOTHESES. Pepper's thesis is that, as a matter of historical fact, the most nearly adequate ontologies or world hypotheses happen to have stemmed from "root metaphors." He gives a much too brief survey of the history of metaphysics, mostly ancient Greek, to substantiate his claim. He holds that the root metaphor method is the most promising way of developing reliable world theories, but he leaves the way open for theories to stem from other sources. He is helpful in showing what happens to an ontology which in fact stemmed from a metaphor when it loses contact with its root metaphor. Its concepts become empty abstractions. Such abstractness is sterilß and lends itself to word magic when the very</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 144 emptiness of the concepts is used as evidence for their truth. 4 I find this very helpful and I only wish Pepper had gone further with it. I wish he had examined the unfortunate results we can ex- pect to occur when an ontology fails to recognize the metaphorical character of its roots and claims instead to be founded on aliterai ground. The reason Pepper did not go into this is that he thinks some ontologies can stem from non -metaphorical roots. If I can show that Pepper is really on much stronger ground than a mere historical generalization because all ontologies are necessarily met- aphorical in origin and in essence, then Pepper's observations on the sterility of an ontology which loses contact with its roots will still hold, but a new kind of failure possible for an ontology will also come to light. This is the failure of misconceiving the roots and therefore the nature of one's own ontology. I hope to show that when this misconception - mistaking the metaphorical roots for literal - sets in, any given ontology's metaphysical or revela- tory moment is over. To show that all ontologies are necessarily metaphorical, let us turn to A. J. Ayer. His central position is that philosophy, by which I think he means ontology, is a mistake. It is a mistake stemming from the confusion of attempting to deal with problems in the absence of a literal and explicit body of methods and cate- gories. When the so-called problems of philosophy are parcelled out to the various disciplines which have literal and explicit meth- ods and categories, philosophy will wither away. On this reading all the errors of ontology (and, I take it, ontology means a body of errors) stem from the attempt to deal with problems using no categories, confused categories or, at best, the wrong categories. In fact it is the misuse of categories that makes many of the so- called problems arise in the first place. Wittgenstein also seems to have much the same-spirit of therapy by way of literalness. "We are aiming at complete clarity. But this simply means that tne philosophical problems should com- pletely disappear. "5 And one of the most effective means toward clarity is: "When philosophers use a word - knowledge, being, ob- ject, I, proposition, name - and try to grasp the essence of the thing, one must always ask oneself: Is the word ever actually used in this way in the language game which is its original home? "6 They disagree then on the source of literal clarity - Ayer gets it from sciences, Wittgenstein from language - but they agree that the ontological sickness which requires their therapy is the making of category mistakes. The view is widely held then - rightly or wrongly - that ontology is essentially the making of category mis- takes.</page><page sequence="5">145 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT I am grateful to Colin Turbayne's THE MYTH OF METAPHOR for pointing out the similarity, almost a verbatim transcript, be- tween Ryle's definitions of category mistake and Aristotle's defi- nition of metaphor. Aristotle: "Metaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else . . . " (POETICS 1457). And Ryle: " the presentation of the facts of one category in the idioms appropriate to another." Alternatively: "it represents the facts ... as if they belonged to one logical type or category (or range of types of categories) when they actually belong to another. "7 Now, Turbayne's task in THE MYTH OF METAPHOR is to show that Berkeley's theory of vision, which is consciously metaphori- cal in nature in comparing vision to language, is as good as or better than the classical theory of vision taught in high schools for the last 2400 years. To do this he must show that the classical theory, which is an important subdivision of mechanistic ontology, is itself a metaphor. He realizes, of course, that the classic theory of vision, like the mechanistic ontology, does not claim to be merely LIKE Euclidean geometry. It claims, in fact, that its geometric explanatory devices have perfect counterparts serving as essential factors in vision. Turbayne does a careful and thorough job of showing that the classic theory musts be a metaphor because if it is taken as literal it clearly flies in the face of agreed facts, sets itself impossible problems and delivers itself of untes table con- clusions. I am not now interested in whether the alternative met- aphorical theory of vision as language is better. I am interested and eager to agree with Turbayne that at this level of scientific hypothesis we are immersed in ontology and that at this level any attempt to sweep all metaphor to one side and replace it with strict literal fact is prima facie evidence of naivete. If Turbayne is right that the geometric theory of vision is a metaphor then the whole mechanistic ontology in which it holds a central position is equally metaphorical. Now this is encouraging. If the ontology which has been for so long the one most congenial to hard headed, literal minded sciences is itself a metaphor, perhaps the other ontologies too would one by one show up as metaphorical under examination. But while I am on the subject of an ontology or a metaphor which can be made useful to science, let me cite a disturbing observation from Max Black's MODELS AND METAPHORS. Black says that in order to have any explanatory power at all, a metaphor must be taken literally. ® Now failing to see that your root metaphor is a metaphor is the chief danger which Turbayne warns against. It would seem that this would produce different but equally disastrous results as losing contact with the root metaphor entirely. But</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF THOUGHT 146 then I see that what Black takes away with one hand he at least partially restores with the other. He says that a metaphor does not uncover aspects antecedently present but previously ignored, rather the metaphor creates new aspects. 9 Taken literally, this is patently false for it means anyone can alter anything simply by altering his way of thinking about it. But taken metaphorically he seems on safe ground. ' So understood, I think he means we have as a result of a metaphor some metaphorically novel aspects to be in- vestigated, though literally these aspects were there all the time. To this Black adds one of two things; I am not sure which. Either that a literal minded scientist can enter the new land only by pre- tending the principle that opened it is literal, or that the scientist must actually be duped into taking literally what Black knoVs is a metaphor. The first - pretending - is what one ordinarily means by using a metaphor clearly recognized as such. The second - duping the scientist - looks very much like a noble falsehood; it improves the performance of the Guardians but the truly wise know it is not so. We could pursue our task of showing ontologies tobe metaphori- cal via Pepper's method of examining them one by one. But Pepper treated only four ontologies and we must treat them all. Our method then must be to find an essential feature present in any possible ontology and show that this feature is itself metaphori- cal. I think this can be done. To begin with, any ontology must claim to be dealing with being: And the subject matter tobe dealt with must be one of two things, or in some ontologies a mixture of two things. Either it must deal with the particular existence of that which is in being or it must bypass the particular and aim at the whole of reality. I will call the first an ontology of the concrete object and the second an on- tology of transcendent being. Of course, an ontology can be a mix- ture of these, but if each of these can be shown to be metaphori- cal, then any mixture would similarly be metaphorical. Let us examine first an ontology of the concrete object. Now, to treat a concretum ontologically is somehow to grasp its very being. Ontology cannot be content with a pragmatically interest- ing handful of aspects. This means it must ^aim a sort of com- pleteness. To grasp an object's very being is to grasp the object in its entirety. This ontologically originated impetus towards completeness is, I think, the source of strength and appeal in those theories of knowledge which describe knowing as an identification or coincidence of subject and object. But at the same time, these theories doom themselves to disappointment because their perfect</page><page sequence="7">147 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT ideal of knowing is an absolute identity of subject and object which is impossible. More precisely, the identity is possible only in a mystic experience of rapture or complete absorption which neces- sarily transcends the powers of these theories to describe or ex- plain. For an example of this, Plotinus V, 5. It seems then that an ontology of the concrete object must claim to grasp the object completely whether in fact it does so or whether, as I think is the case, it grasps it partially. I think Plotinus could show reasons that, despite the claim of complete- ness, the grasp of the concrete object must be partial, but let us examine an ontology's hold on an object as though completeness and partiality were equally possible. In the first place, any ontology which claims completeness but in fact delivers a partial hold on an object will fit Ryle' s definition of a category mistake or Aristotle's definition of a metaphor. It will be presenting the facts of one category (the whole being of the object) in the idioms appropriate to another (the few aspects preferred by the given ontology). It will be giving the thing as a whole the name that belongs to some- thing else - the selected parts. Clearly such an ontology is meta- phorical through and through. But suppose an ontology actually delivers completeness. This is the only escape hatch. We have already seen Whitehead's warning that philosophy so conceived, with its attendant finality and dog- matism, is folly. Moreover, this understanding of the nature of one's ontology slams the door on any fruitful dialectic with com- peting ontologies. Along with this, as I hope to show, comes the end of any genuinely metaphysical moment, the ontology no longer being open to being because it prefers instead to concentrate on its own attributes or categories. Arguing against an ontology so conceived, I could cite Plotinus. The impossibility of absolute identity of subject and object would rule out some such ontologies in a hurry but to track down all on- tologies of concrete objects by this means would be made difficult because so many ingenious characterizations of objects have been čoncocted, especially by idealists; which make some degree of coincidence of subject and object seem plausible. Let me simply say that if there is no being over and above a given ontology, 'there is nothing to which the ontology can refer or relate. This means that the ontology itself must claim to be re- ality. I am not just making Kierkegaard's point that such an on- tology is a dream castle claiming to be real bricks and stone. I am instead giving a new twist and broader application to Plotinus' point. If no subject can be identical with its object, no theory,</page><page sequence="8">JOURÑAL OF THOUGHT 148 account, or set of categories can be identical with its object either. Thus, every ontology of the concrete object must be partial. If it is to be ontological, it must be metaphorical. Turning now to what I have called ontologies of transcen- dent being, those which bypass the particular and aim at the whole of reality or at a being - as - such common to all levels of being, we find some ontologies which are partial and know it, some which are partial but do not know it. The arguments I have already used to show that ontologies must oe partial and therefore metaphorical will apply equally well here. To them I now add that any ontology of transcendent being must be metaphorical because there is no idiom appropriate to being as such. This is not because we never experience being but because we never experience anything else. In such a situation someone could I suppose demand literal categories; then the only categories open to him are Parmenides' being and non-being. I am not sure how to argue against this short of assuming an ontological position myself, but the fact that Parmenides, once he has made the dis- tinction, can say nothing further, allows me to conclude that any- one who wants to say anything about being as such had better take his categories from some restricted area within being and then stretch his categories to fit all of being. And this clearly means the use of metaphor or category mistakes. The choice open to on- tologists of this sort is not "to be metaphorical or not, " rather it is "to be consciously or unconsciously metaphorical." Some examples may make the difference clearer. We could develop a chemistry resting on an anthropomorphic on- tology. We would seek explanations of the phenomena in terms of affinities, powers, loves and hates among the little people in the chemicals. Such a chemistry could work and form a part of an ontology which would remain satisfactory even when its metaphor- ical nature is clearly recognized. Now reverse this, build a theory of man based on the categories and laws of a chemical ontology. This is the same category mistake in reverse so it is equally met- aphorical. The major difference is that the latter vehemently de- nies it is a metaphor. And well it might, for when it is shown up to be a metaphor, a chemistry based ontology becomes very un- satisfactory. Our reluctance to admit that the latter is a metaphor does not stem from a refusal to attempt an understanding of man based on metaphors grounded in other areas of experience. Countless peo- ple have accepted a deiform, theomorphic or image-of-God meta- phor to apply to man. St. Bonaventure constructed a workable</page><page sequence="9">149 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT theory of man along these lines. Of course, such a view must draw its characterization of God from outside philosophy, which is why not only the theory of man but the whole ontology of Bonaventure is inseparable from his theology. The point is, Bonaventure real- ized that he was understanding man by way of a metaphor and he was contented with this realization. Why do ontologists who find their primary analogate in certain other quarters of reality or experience demand to be taken literally, that is, refuse to admit they have been caught making a category mistake? Perhaps I am doing these men an injustice. Maybe they did suc- cessfully avoid the dreaded metaphors and category mistakes. I am sure if they did, it was because they learned what category mistakes are and how to avoid them from Professor Ryle. Let us look into this. After convicting Descartes of speaking of mind in terms appro- priate to body, Ryle goes on to allocate mind to its proper cate- gories. Mind is not a ghost in a machine; mind is really a set of "dispositions, ability, pronenesses to do certain things. "10 Tur- bayne says Ryle thinks he has eliminated the metaphors and sorted out properly the facts Descartes crossed up. H Now, what makes Ryle think his account is literal? Has Ryle lost contact with his root metaphor? I do not think so. When this hap- pens, events of a type uncongenial bp the root metaphor's home ground will be allowed to stand in for the categories. Ryle will not allow us to speak of a PRONENESS to mortal sin, a DISPOSITION to grace or an ABILITY to commune with the over soul. If he did, he would beheaded for the sterile abstractions against which Pep- per warns. Ryle avoids this mistake and will allow only prone- nesses, etc. , which can be verified by direct observation. His root metaphor then, with which he never loses contact, is the direçtly observable events of science or common sense. This seems to frame a dilemma; Ryle must say either that the categories of direct observation should be metaphorically stretched to cover all levels of being, or he must be claiming to know that there is only one level of being. The former is open advocacy of the use of metaphor such as we would expect from Bonaventure but hardly from Ryle. But the latter is ontology with a vengeance. It is ontology claiming to be the finished metaphysics. It is fair game for Kierkegaard1 s lampoon and for most of the critique we directed against the dogmatic ontologies of the concrete object. But I think Ryle would escape the dilemma by claiming that the idiom and categories of direct observation are never metaphorical; they are literal by nature wherever they apply. This avoids advo-</page><page sequence="10">JOUF ^AX OF THOUGHT 150 eating metaphor yet makes no claim to know all about being. But this way out puts Ryle in an even worse position. If there is any difference between the use of metaphor and the making of category mistakes, it is this. Where categories which apply literally in one area of experience are stretched to fit an- other area and the man who thus transfers them knows he is stretching them, we have metaphor. But if he fails to see that importing categories from one area into another strips them of the literal status they enjoyed in their home territory, we have category mistakes. They result from thinking you are using an idiom literally when in fact you are using it metaphorically. Now Ryle thinks he has treated mind literally. If he has used metaphors, he has done so unconsciously and is guilty of the mistake. Turbayne suggests-^ the best treatment for the mistake is the procedure Hume follows in DIALOGS ON NATURAL RELIGION. He takes the assertions Clean the s makes about God, pretends they are perfectly literal, and proceeds to dr^w devastatingly inappro- priate conclusions. God is an egg, a seed, a gang of ship builders, etc. Now this attack serves only to point out that a metaphor is a metaphor. It is no weapon against a philosopher who already knows this. It would not embarrass Bonaventure at all, and I think Plato would actually enjoy it. A man is two horses and a chario- teer? Then each man should wear 8 horse shoes and 2 sandals? A man is a miniature city ? Is each man filled with tiny little build- ings? And so forth. But to a philosopher who thinks he is literal this approach can reduce him to tears if not absurdity. It was perfectly fitting that it was the descendants of Hume who followed Ryle down the supposedly literal path to a new ontology of mind. Take literally that man is a bundle of pronenesses, etc. , exclusively to such events as we can literally verify by direct ob- servation and the conclusion Norman Malcolm drew follows handily. Hume must have applauded this application of his old attack. Cer- tainly Malcolm is right that on this basis we can never tell that another man has a pain or that he even thinks at all. 13 And cer- tainly this conclusion is as embarrassing to this ontology of mind as God's being an egg or a seed was to old Clean the s 0 The remedy in each case is the same - avoid this just and fitting embarrass- ment by admitting that the conception on which it rests is in fact a metaphor. This does not jhow that the empirically oriented con- ception of mind is false; it shows it was neither true nor false be- cause it was a metaphor all the time, as any ontology must be. Although all ontologies are metaphors and thus cannot be literally true, there still are criteria for selecting an ontology. Though</page><page sequence="11">151 JOURNAL OF THOUGHT they are not true, they serve as conceptual frameworks within which truths appear in a perspective. The marks of a good ontol- ogy then are that it avoid claiming to be both comprehensive and literal, rather it should be conscious of its metaphorical charac- ter. Second, it should be fertile, suggestive of a rich variety of hypotheses and methods to verify them. Third, it should impose a broad perspective on truths from many sources. Most of all, a good ontology is one which never loses sight of be- ing. To do this it must realize that being underlies and yet eludes any net of categories, laws and principles. A good ontology never mistakes the net for the quarry. It is this mistake, taking the factors of our ontology for being itself, which is the really deadly category mistake for it necessarily blinds us to being itself. NOTES !f. H.
