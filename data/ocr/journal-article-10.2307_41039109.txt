<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Collections of Mortality Dickens, the Paris Morgue, and the Material Corpse BIANCA TREDENNICK paris Morgue, with which Dickens was familiar, stood on the bank of the Seine from 1830 to 1864. Its practical purpose was the identifica- tion of unknown bodies, many of which were fished out of the river. To this end, the dead were placed on slanted tables with whatever clothes they were found in hung on pegs behind them. To retard decomposition, cold water dripped constantly over them from taps. The bodies faced a glass panel that enabled people who were missing relatives to identify and claim the bodies. But the morgue soon developed a less pragmatic function; it became a place of entertainment for curious locals and foreigners. Indeed, the morgue became so popular that it was listed in several British guidebooks as one of the tourist attractions of Paris. It is impossible to know how often Dickens went to the morgue, but in "Railway Dreaming," he describes the morgue as a "strange sight, which I have contemplated many a time during the last dozen years" (174)» and in "Some Recollections of Mortality," he calls it his "old acquaintance" (102). It is difficult for us to understand the popularity of the morgue, but we can get closer to comprehension if we see it as part of larger nineteenth-century attitudes toward death. Though it has come under attack of late, especially for such legitimate issues as class assumptions, the definitive work on the devel- opment of Western attitudes toward death remains Philippe Aries's The Hour of Our Death. In it, Aries claims that attitudes toward death had "for centuries . . . remained almost fixed .... And suddenly, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, within one or two generations, there is a new sensibility that is dif- ferent from everything that has preceded it" (442). He labels the nineteenth century the "age of the beautiful death" (409) , writing that A visit to a house in which someone has died is a little like a visit to a museum .... But this . . . should not blind us to the contradiction ... for this death is no longer death, it is an illusion of art. Death has started to hide. In spite of the apparent publicity that surrounds it in mourning, at the cemetery, in life as well as in art and literature, death is concealing itself under the mask of beauty. (473) 72</page><page sequence="2">bianca tredennick: Some Collections of Mortality What he means is that for all the nineteenth century's well-charted obsession with grandiose funerals and elaborate mourning rituals, it is an era oddly more distanced from death than its predecessors. In earlier centuries, the dead were not so metaphorized; they were dealt with more literally as real corpses subject to decay (though, of course, the soul could survive elsewhere). The nineteenth century, however, came to fear the dead body for reasons that include more doubt about whether there is a soul to survive the body. Critics often build on Aries in their examination of Dickens 's morgue articles, attempting to make sense of how the morgue's popularity jibes with Aries's view that death is less directly visible in the nineteenth century. Vanessa Schwartz argues that the apparent contradiction is solved by understanding that morgue visitors reread the dead: "Aided by the growth of the mass-circulated press and organized tour- ism, the spectacle of the corpse in the morgue's display window transformed the formerly eternal corpse into something ephemeral: current events" (49). The morgue did not prompt a real engagement with "anonymous corpses," Schwartz argues, but a recontextualizing of the dead as "spectacularized real- ity; one whose reality-effect was bolstered by the spectacle's re -presentation of other sights with which the morgue's crowd was no doubt familiar - from mass-circulated newspapers, police memoirs written for a popular audience, and even wax museums" (87). This slippage from corpse to corpse-effect indicates the elision of the real body by the spectacle encompassing it. Going one step further, Paul Vita contends that reactions to the morgue, far from subverting Aries's claim, actually exceed it, "anticipating" the twentieth century's move "to deny [death] entirely." This denial is achieved by "displac- ing the reality of death into literature, through textualizing the experience and thus distancing it so that responses to death become a matter of vicarious readings, not personal experiences" (242). While my own argument will benefit from these critics' insights into spec- tacle and the negotiation of death with inscription, I find myself at odds with the shared assumption that Dickens 's articles successfully mask death from view, transforming it into something that the author and his readers can expel from their own lives. Instead, Dickens 's articles attempt such a delineation only to have it collapse under the weight of the material corpse. The aestheticiza- tion of the corpse to which Aries refers and the commodity fetishism such an aestheticization brings with it render the corpse the only thing that is visible. Indeed, Dickens 's essays fail at containment precisely through the strategies by which he attempts it. The more Dickens tries to seize control over death by relegating the corpse to merely material status, art object, consumable good, or spectacular display, the more the material world itself is revealed as a world of death. In 18^6, "Railway Dreaming" appeared in Dickens 's magazine, Household Words. In this, the first of his extended pieces on the morgue, Dickens uses a peculiar image to describe it: "The bodies lie on inclined planes within a great glass window, as though Holbein should represent Death, in his grim Dance, keeping 73</page><page sequence="3">Victorian review Û* Volume 36 Number 1 a shop, and displaying his goods like a Regent Street or Boulevard linen draper" (174). This passage is fundamentally concerned with representation: Dickens describes to his British readers what the Paris Morgue looks like. The passage starts matter-of-factly with a literal description of its physical layout, but before the first sentence is over, Dickens shifts. He no longer describes just the morgue but also the way in which it "represent [s] Death." In doing so, he moves from the literal to the figurai, employing a chain of similes. In the first simile, the morgue represents death by looking like a work by Holbein; Dickens aestheticizes death, paralleling the corpses with artwork. This vision of the morgue accords nicely with Aries's idea of the house of the dead being like a museum, but what is the image's effect? On the one hand, figuring the corpses as aesthetic objects on display underlines their remoteness and their controllability. Like a fragment of Greek pottery, the dead are at the mercy of the living, who can collect them, display them, and in doing so make them tell a certain story. They become the narratives the organizers want to tell and the crowds want to read. Indeed, Dickens refers to the display of the clothing of the dead as a "library of mysterious books that I have often had my eyes on" ( 17s) • The contrasting subjectivity of the visitors to the morgue is underlined by Dickens 's oddly repetitive description of the cadavers as being "placed to be seen by all who choose to go and look at them" ( 174) . The dead are spectacles at the mercy of those who can see and look. This seems precisely the sort of erasure through containment and displacement strategy that we saw critics evoking earlier. Yet the image also produces a quite different effect. In order for the dead to become art objects, their status as aesthetic thing must be underscored. In other words, Dickens 's metaphor privileges the materiality of the corpse. The corpse is like a museum piece and as such is implicated in the notions of exhibit, spectacle, and even entertainment that such a comparison brings with it (Schwartz passim) . But when a society associates death with the materiality of the living world, the dead seem to say more about us than we say about them. This is especially true in cultures that seem particularly invested in the material - cultures like our own and that of Victorian Britain. And if the dead are art objects, they achieve a certain supremacy over the living viewer. They are, like Holbein's works, masterpieces worthy of elevation to the status of objet d'art, and as such, they somehow exceed normal humanity, which in turn requires specialized knowledge to read them correctly. It is for this reason that the "books" are "mysterious" ("Railway" 17^). They invite and resist compre- hension, as Dickens soon finds. He explains that the clothes "mostly have been taken off people who were found in the water, and are swollen (as the people often are) out of shape and likeness" (176). Immediately, the corpses' deformation confuses the narrative. This calls into question the morgue's ostensible reason for being - the possibil- ity of recognition and identification. The less practical its purpose, the more the morgue seems to exhibit the dead for the sake of the exhibition. Again, the dead's value in such a scenario is intrinsic and aesthetic. It also raises the 74</page><page sequence="4">bianca TREDENNICK: Some Collections of Mortality issue of resemblance. The clothes resemble the corpses, in that neither of them resembles their pre-death selves. As Dickens says, "such awful boots ... shall be found in no other collection of dress; nor, such neckcloths, ... nor such slimy garments" ( 176). I am reminded of Maurice Blanchot's claim in The Gaze of Orpheus that the dead person "begins to resemble himself" (emphasis original, 82). Blanchot explains that the result of this resemblance between the corpse and the living person is that while it is "the dear living one," it is also "more than him, he is more beautiful, more imposing, already monumental" (83). To return to the terms I have been using, the corpse becomes aestheticized and through that aestheticization gains power. Blanchot claims that the corpse is the archetypal image because its insistent materiality ultimately acts to block our view of the signified even as it attempts to represent that signified. Dickens s effort to make the corpses and their clothing say more than they say is thus balked. All that is visible are remains whose insistent materiality concretizes them as signifieds, frustrating every attempt to make them signifiers. Keeping this in mind allows us to reread the repetitiveness of Dickens 's description of the corpses being "placed to be seen by all who choose to go and look at them" as a desperate attempt to disempower and objectify the corpse, but Dickens 's statement belies its own intent through a grammatical subversion. The sentence is a passive construction: "The bodies ... are placed to be seen by all who choose to go and look at them" (174). This moves what should be the direct object (the bodies) into the syntactical subject position and erases the human subjects (those who placed the bodies). The corpses then achieve subjectivity at the expense of the living, who are denied even the secondary status of a passive prepositional phrase ("the bodies are placed ... by the attendants"). Here, the living humans have less agency than the dead, a prob- lem that Dickens himself shares, as is indicated by his recourse to the passive. This grammatical elision of the morgue attendants is particularly interest- ing given Dickens s comment upon seeing the attendants among the corpses: But I never derived so strange a sensation from this dismal establishment as on going in there once, and finding the keeper moving about among the bodies. I never saw a living creature in among them, before or since, and the wonder was that he looked so much more ghastly and intolerable than the dead, stark people. There is a strong light from above, and a general cold, clammy aspect; and I think that with the first start of seeing him must have come the impression that the bodies were all getting up! It was instantaneous; but he looked horribly incongruous there, even after it had departed. (17s) Where Dickens describes the morgue attendants, we would expect a sense of relief at finding somebody with agency, somebody capable of controlling and fixing the dead, but instead we find great unease. Dickens sees the morgue worker not as controlling or organizing but as merely "moving about among 75</page><page sequence="5">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number i the bodies." The worker s passivity is underscored as he moves from vitality to deathliness, becoming "more ghastly and intolerable than the dead," who are suddenly "dead, stark people" (my italics) - as if they gain vitality as the morgue worker loses it. If neither Dickens nor the morgue attendants possess agency, what of the French crowd? There is, Dickens tells us, a "market for fruit and vegetables" close by, and so the morgue is frequently surrounded by "mountebanks," "learned owls," and even a "performing dog . . . with a red jacket" (175). The crowd's engagement with these entertainments is indistinguishable from its attitude toward the morgue: It is wonderful to see the people at this place. Cheery married women, basket in hand, strolling in, on their way to or from the buying of the day's dinner; children in arms with little pointing fingers; young girls; prowling boys; comrades in working, soldiering, or what not. Ninety-nine times in a hundred, nobody about to cross the threshold, looking in the faces coming out, could form the least idea, from anything in their expression, of the nature of the sight. I have studied them attentively, and have reason for saying so. (175) There are two ways of reading the crowd's relationship to the morgue. The first way is the way that Dickens chooses to foreground, in which he uses the crowd's insensitivity to critique the French. In their work on the morgue, both Vita and Britta Martens foreground the jingoism by which Dickens attempts to separate his enlightened attitude toward death from what Martens calls the "degenerate French reaction to spectacular corpses" (22^). Those who are unmoved by death are consistently the objects of some of Dickens 's harshest attacks, and here Dickens suggests that the French people's very obtuseness is dehumanizing. They resemble the clown who plies his trade on the very steps of the morgue "with such intentness that he has almost backed himself in at the doorway"; like the inhabitants of Holbein's Dance of Death pieces, they give no thought to their approaching demise until Death comes into their parlours, pulls aside their bed curtains, or interrupts their card games to fetch them (175). Seeing the French in this way allows Dickens to rescue for himself some agency from their insensitivity. He insists that he has actively "studied" the visitors of the morgue and can "see" them. This contrasts not only with his passivity in front of the corpses (a problem we will see more of in his other essays on the morgue) but, of course, also with the crowd's own blindness. The locals may look, but they do not understand "the nature of the sight." Vita suggests that Dickens 's focus on the observers throughout the morgue articles makes them "part of the spectacle themselves and subject to the tourist's inter- pretation. Indeed, his reading of the expressions on their faces objectifies them in the same way they are objectifying the morgue's display" (2^1). Yet even here, Dickens seems too eager to present his credentials, as if his 76</page><page sequence="6">bianca tredennick: Some Collections of Mortality disempowering experience with the dead has made him insecure about his ability to read the living. His authorial voice, already rendered passive, is in danger of falling prey to the same kind of mystified blankness found in the crowd. This tension results from the second possible reading of the French response to the morgue. For we might read the above passage as indicating that the French people do, in fact, preserve their agency in the face of the morgue: they take it in stride and make it part of their everyday activities. Though the proximity of the morgue to the market and the fair strikes Dickens as gro- tesque, it is, in fact, a not uncommon historical association. Aries explains that in medieval France, the cemetery was often the "marketplace; place for announcements, auctions, proclamations, sentences; scene of community gath- erings; promenade; athletic field; haven for illicit encounters and dubious professions - in short, the cemetery was the public square .... the center of collective life" (70). The real lesson that the Parisian crowd teaches, a lesson that Dickens ironically ends up revealing, is that the morgue makes sense only when seen as part of the market. The only narrative that enables the living to reconcile themselves to the morgue is one in which the line between morgue and market is acknowledged to be fluid, in which the dead, like the dancing dogs, are spectacles, and in which the corpse is commodified. Given that Dickens was the author of "Trading in Death," written on the eve ofWellington s state funeral as an invective against the Victorian marketing of funeral items, his horror at this association between death and the market makes sense. In that piece, written four years before "Railway Dreaming," Dickens cries out against the "Public Fair and Great Undertakers Jubilee" tak- ing place "over . . . [Wellington s] remains" (446) as the worst example of the more general Victorian tendency by which a system of barbarous show and expense was found to have gradually erected itself above the grave, which, while it could possibly do no honour to the memory of the dead, did great dishonour to the living, as inducing them to associate the most solemn of human occasions with unmeaning mummeries, dishonest debt, profuse waste, and bad example in an utter oblivion of responsibility. (438) For Dickens, the commodification of death was frightening and unforgivable, an example of the market economy run amok. The presence of the market in the cemetery, according to Aries, was typical of the medieval comfort with the corpse, a comfort springing from the certainty that the soul lived on else- where. But for Dickens the Victorian, such a proximity evokes the terrors of the commodified corpse, the insistent physicality of the dead, whose material remains, seen as objects of exchange, indict the present as a world of death. This fact of the morgue's location near the market invokes the second step in Dickens's long chain of similes. The morgue does not just resemble a Holbein but an imagined Holbein in which Death would be represented "keeping a shop, and displaying his goods like a Regent Street or Boulevard 77</page><page sequence="7">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number 1 linen draper" (174). Again, we find the disturbing connection of death with materiality, but here even more clearly in the guise of materialism. Like goods in a store window display, the corpses incite the desire for consumption. But Dickens warns that, like a Holbein character who would buy Death's products, the morgue's customers are consumed by their materialism. Again, the dead refuse to be objectified; they decline to be mere objects of exchange among the living. Through the living's very desire for the corpse, the corpse comes to have a meaning that exceeds its human consumers. It is fetishized and thus takes on a life of its own. For Dickens, the morgue is a kind of touchstone for a society built upon an economy of death. Nor is this an economy that Dickens can escape. Indeed, in the complex similes that make up this dense image, the material is not textualized and thus displaced; rather, it is the only thing that remains visible. The morgue is the signified to be represented by the simile, but it becomes the signifier for death. Death as signified is then represented by Holbein as signifier, and Holbein seamlessly becomes the signified as Dickens employs contemporary market- places as signifiers for the explication of the Holbein reference. Put another way, the process is this: You want to know what Death looks like? It looks like the morgue. What does the morgue look like? It looks like a Holbein depicting Death keeping a shop. What kind of shop might Death keep? Exactly the same kind of shop that you see and frequent every day. We are left with a chain of material things that come into finer and finer focus as additional lenses are applied, while death remains invisible. In its very attempt to find an effective way of describing death, then, this long and complex chain of similes underlines the impossibility of any such description. As the signs proliferate, they spin us ever further from the signified. Indeed, we are left in doubt as to what the real object of representation is: the bodies? the morgue? the material or metaphysi- cal condition of death? The result is not an evolving precision about what the unfathomable death might be but a new way of viewing the familiar material of modern Victorian life, the "Regent Street or Boulevard" merchandise to which Dickens finally resorts in his struggle for signification. Instead of showing us how death is like the morgue or how death is like a Holbein, Dickens shows us how the morgue, the Holbein, and even the Victorian shop window are like death. Unlike "Railway Dreaming," Dickens 's next extended examination of the Paris Morgue, "Travelling Abroad" (i860), does not begin with an objective stance. He does not attempt to describe the appearance of the morgue or in any way to suggest his ability to contain it rhetorically. Instead, its opening prepares us for what will be his most personal and most psychological article on the morgue: "Whenever I am at Paris, I am dragged by invisible force into the Morgue. I never want to go there, but am always pulled there" (193). These opening lines are a long way from "Railway'"s effort at critical distance. This time, Dickens lacks even the agency to choose whether or when to enter the morgue. The "invisible force" compels him to go even on Christmas and New Year's Day, "when [he] would rather have been anywhere else." On one such 78</page><page sequence="8">bianca TREDENNICK: Some Collections of Mortality Christmas Day, Dickens discovers an "old grey man lying all alone on his cold bed, with a tap of water turned on over his grey hair, and running . . . down his wretched face until it got to the corner of this mouth, where it took a turn, and made him look sly" (196). The enigmatically smirking corpse is a completely opaque image, resisting and mocking any effort to make it mean- ingful. Indeed, die only thing that this image evokes is the body's materiality. Both the discussion of the water and the use of the word "turn" suggest the cadaver's imminent rot, and under the corpse's influence, Dickens 's language itself begins to decompose. His writerly images designed to metaphorize and safely expel the corpse do him a bad turn, becoming decaying language. The New Year's Day visit to which Dickens next refers is similarly cryptic. There, Dickens sees "a flaxen-haired boy of eighteen, with a heart hanging on his breast - 'from his mother/ was engraven on it - who had come into the net across the river, with a bullet wound in his fair forehead and his hands cut with a knife, but whence or how was a blank mystery" ( 196). This body seems loaded with symbols, as if it should provide an allegory to redeem this New Year's trip to the morgue. At first sight, the heart inscribed "from his mother" seems to offer the hope of such a meaning. Here Dickens is on New Year's Day, a day of beginning and new hope, looking at a piece of jewellery that seems similarly concerned with origins. The heart is "from" the boy's mother, and the boy too, of course, comes from the same source. Similarly, the boy's fairness and age seem to offer some kind of lesson on purity and youth. But Dickens never decodes this potential lesson. Though the dead boy remains resolutely textual (he is literally written upon, like a page) , this fact does not turn him into a sign for a redeeming metaphysi- cal signified but only leads insistently back to the corpse as the beginning and end of signification. The reflexivity of the artificial heart hanging over the real heart of the dead underscores this signifying loop, as does the fact that the legend on the heart that speaks of origins is readable only at the terminus of the boy's life. What began, perhaps, as a birthday present is now transformed into a memento mori, and its message transformed into an epitaph. It is here that Dickens s choice of the word "engraven" reveals its full nuances. "Engraven" comes from "en" and "grave," meaning "to dig in or on." Indeed, there is an obsolete word - "ingrave," meaning "to entomb" - for which "engrave" was a variant ("Engrave"). Far from offering a sign that leads outside the materiality of the corpse, then, the engraven heart leads insistently back to it. The jewellery heart refers also to the real heart beneath, which is soon to be itself "engraven." The cadaver, which seemed to offer the possibility of providing an allegory for a metaphysical truth, reveals instead the complex tautology of the corpse as both sign and signified. For Dickens, the boy is ultimately unreadable, a "blank" (196), like the "library of mysterious books" that thwarted his earlier inter- pretive endeavours. Rather than signifying a truth greater than itself and thus making this trip to the morgue meaningful, the body's status as figure becomes a dead end, the point at which signification and interpretation terminate. 79</page><page sequence="9">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number i But the account of these past visits to the morgue only prefaces the real subject of this article, a summertime stop during which Dickens sees "a large dark man" whose distinguishing characteristic is his "disfigurement by water." The sight makes Dickens ill, and as he stumbles out of the morgue, he encoun- ters a French woman "who had been showing . . . [the corpse] to her little girl while she and the child ate sweetmeats." The woman politely inquires if there is "anything the matter" with Dickens. Dickens uses this woman's response to represent once more the French insensitivity to the morgue. What is for Dickens a "dread place" is for the woman a place to buy and eat snacks and a place of entertaining spectacle suitable for children (196). But, for Dickens, "the matter" is indeed the problem, and he becomes haunted by the spectacle of the dead body. Trying to escape his illness, Dickens decides upon a refreshing swim in the "great floating bath on the river" (196). But while the other men enjoy this lively "social routine," Dickens is suddenly overcome by the "unreasonable idea that the large dark body was floating straight at me." Dickens scrambles out of the river, horrified that he had "taken some water" into his mouth. As he wrote, "it turned me sick, for I fancied that the contamination of the creature was in it" ( 197) . Vybars Cregan-Reid reads this as one of many scenes in which water becomes a symbol for Dickens s anxiety about the permeability of mate- rial bodies - the sense that the "borderlines and perimeters of one's body are illusory ... that bodies are capable of becoming other bodies" (31). Speaking of Harmon's soliloquy on his near-drowning in Our Mutual Friend, Pamela Gilbert also focuses on water as the site for a threatening permeability and intersubjec- tivity : "The metaphors here are all of containment .... defining and defending clear boundaries of the self" (96). Dickens's use of water as the site to explore a threatening lack of definition between bodies accords with my reading of his morgue articles. For while Crygan-Reid goes on to read the sequence as a fantasy (and rejection) of same-sex desire, I think we must remain focused on the fact that it is not just any man who penetrates Dickens, but a dead man, whose mortality seems of much greater significance to Dickens than his sex. In short, this scene completes the pattern we saw earlier, in which he dis- covers himself and his language infected by the death it attempts to define. Here, the corpse assumes agency, transforming itself from a lifeless, passive object to a moving, active subject capable of victimizing him. The corpse's new life seems to bring Dickens closer to the condition of death, a pattern underscored by his immersion into the very river from which the corpse had been retrieved. Similarly, Dickens's fear that he has ingested corpse water and caught what the corpse has (a bad case of death) blurs the line between them. As the article continues, so too does Dickens's haunting. He sees the dead body everywhere: in his dinner, in a boxing match, in streets and theatres, and in shop windows. In The Night Side of Dickens, Harry Stone labels this obsession as typical of Dickens's revolted attraction to cannibalism: "Dickens ... has now eaten of the dead man's body" (99). He notes that this experience remains 80</page><page sequence="10">bianca tredennick: Some Collections of Mortality "eternally alive in Dickens' transforming consciousness," ultimately becoming "generative" of some of his later novels' imagery (ioo). However, while it is certainly true that corpses in rivers form a significant part of his last completed novel, Our Mutual Friend, I believe reading this experi- ence as "generative" gives in to the very desire to make it part of a constructive narrative that Dickens ultimately shows to be unfulfillable. This experience is not constructive or generative, because it represents a pathological view of death. My ideas here are related to the distinction Freud makes in "Mourning and Melancholia," in which mourning is a healthy response to death while melancholia is a dysfunctional response. Mourning is characterized by "intro- jection," a positive removal of libido from the lost object and simultaneous assertion that the ego has the right of "continuing to live" (169). Melancholia, on the other hand, severs the libido from the dead, only to "withdraw" it into the ego. This acts to "establish an identification of the ego with the abandoned object" (i£9, emphasis original), a point I will say more about later. In The Shell and the Kernel, Abraham and Torok explicate Freud's dichotomy in par- ticularly provocative terms. Employing a term used by earlier psychoanalysts, Abraham and Torok label melancholia's internalization of the libido for the dead as "incorporation." Incorporation is a mode of repressing the desire for the dead instead of disposing of it. The effect of this is that it "creates or reinforces imaginai ties and hence dependency" between the survivor and the dead (114). Building on Freud's association of mourning and melancholia with the oral stage of development, they go on to explain that incorporation works by transferring the figurative, the metaphor of "swallowing a loss," into a literal implementation of repression in which we "fantasize swallowing . . . that which has been lost as if it were some kind of thing" ( 126) . Introjection is also represented by the image of the empty mouth, but here, the metaphor is self-aware, and the void is filled by "words to be exchanged with others" (128). In other words, a healthy attitude toward death is one that can turn it into a figure and metaphorize, and thus communicate, the sense of loss. In incorporation, there is no ability to signify the dead, and thus "the words that cannot be uttered . . . will be swallowed along with the trauma that led to the loss. Swallowed and preserved. Inexpressible mourning erects a secret tomb inside the subject" (130). It makes the living receptacle of the incorporated dead into a "commemorative monument" that "betokens the place, the date and circumstances in which desires were banished from introjection" (114). In Dickens 's imagined swallowing of corpse-infected water, we see a clear example of this kind of incorporation at work. He tries two means of meta- phorizing the deathly encounter in order to express and thus expel his feelings in a healthy way. First, he provides a lesson at the end of his article, pushing for the moral that his earlier encounters denied: The experience may be worth considering by some who have the care of children. It would be difficult to overstate the intensity and 81</page><page sequence="11">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number 1 accuracy of an intelligent child's observation. At that impressible time of life, it must sometimes produce a fixed impression. If the fixed impression be of an object terrible to the child, it will be (for want of reasoning upon) inseparable from great fear. Force the child at such a time, be Spartan with it, send it into the dark against its will, leave it in a lonely bed-room against its will, and you had better murder it. ( 198) This moral seems woefully inadequate to account for what has gone before. Dickens s odd, pathological, hallucinogenic haunting over a week by a body at the morgue is more than just an object lesson in child-rearing. Further undermining this attempt to moralize the corpse is the fact that this section of "Travelling Abroad" does not end here, nor does it end with Dickens 's description of himself having "rattled away from Paris in the German chariot, and left the large dark creature behind me for good" (198). Belying the apparent closure of that statement, Dickens goes back in time to give this afterthought: "I ought to confess, though, that I had been drawn back to the morgue, after he was put underground, to look at his clothes" (198). The image of Dickens going back to the morgue in the hopes of getting another glimpse of the corpse is telling. Clearly, he has not been able to metaphorize and thus expel this body from his life, nor has his moral wrapped the body up in a neat package. "However," Dickens asserts with a finality that both his previous false coda and the retrospect shown by the later recording of this event force us to treat with suspicion, "I rattled away for Switzerland, looking forward and not backward, and so we parted company" (198). This might seem like the containment of death for which critics have argued. Returning to Vita, we find him arguing that the experience has been a "self exorcizing activity through which the novelist incorporates the corpse into his own prose" (249). But I would argue not only that we must read the idea of "incorpora- tion" in a more nuanced way than Vita's casual word choice suggests but also that Dickens 's very language is permeated with death. Parting company with the dead might suggest a clean break, but it is also a phrase Dickens uses elsewhere to describe death. In 186^, while he was writing Our Mutual Friend, Dickens underwent the famous Staplehurst railway accident ordeal, a trauma that was to haunt him for the rest of his life. Not only was he surrounded by the dead and dying, but he was made keenly aware of his own brush with death. In Our Mutual Friend's postscript, Dickens muses that he can "never be much nearer parting company with my readers forever than I was then, until there shall be written against my life the two words with which I have this day closed this book - the end" (800). "Parting company" here certainly implies separation, and, indeed, that is the customary way in which Dickens uses this phrase in The Old Curiosity Shop, Our Mutual Friend, and Edwin Drood, but in this postscript, it carries the sense of delineation from the living. In other words, a phrase that usually suggests the mundane act of leaving becomes - in 82</page><page sequence="12">bianca tredennick: Some Collections of Mortality the postscript to Mutual Friend and in "Travelling Abroad" - redolent of death. This is surely no successful exorcism but an infection of both Dickens and his language by the corpse. Dickens s second effort to metaphorize his experience embodies precisely the sort of narrativizing for which critics have argued. However, his narrative efforts are subverted by the resolute materiality and physicality of the corpse. Instead of the physical body of the corpse becoming the vehicle for a produc- tive metaphysical metaphor for death, Dickens cannot get beyond the physical body itself. His intensely physical description of the "large dark man . . . whose expression was that of a prize-fighter who had closed his eyelids under a heavy blow" reveals this, as does the form his obsession takes (196). His haunting is not of the usual kind, in which he sees or fears to see a disembodied and dematerialized spirit of the dead; instead, he is haunted by the insistent mate- riality of the dead body. At dinner, "some morsel ... look[s] like a piece of him" (197); at a boxing match, the condition of the boxer's body resembles the condition of the corpse; in stores, human figures like "the master, or the shopman" or even the merely anthropomorphic "dummy at the door" bring him to Dickens 's mind (198). The haunting spell is never brought on by fear or exposure to situations that otherwise evoke thoughts of death. Rather, these are ordinary occasions, often occurring in the light of day, in which the dead body, fearsome in its resolute materiality, intrudes between Dickens and the living world - indeed, infects the material world with death. Dickens compensates for this frightening materiality by trying to justify seeing the corpse as a figure or trope. In two attempts, he tries to transform the body into metaphor, writing that "the picture of the creature . . . had . . . curiously and strongly painted itself upon my brain" and, later, that "his por- trait seemed to light itself up in my mind" ( 197). In both these cases, Dickens attempts to translate the body into an image, but, as we saw earlier, such an effort fails, leaving him with a "figure" whose solid materiality makes it less a trope and more "an embodied human form" ("Figure," def. ^a). The cadaver has been "incorporated." But this is not the only alternate definition of "figure" that applies here. Using the definition in which the verb "figure" means "to embellish or ornament with a design," "to trace," or "to mark," we can see that Dickens s attempt to dematerialize and thus metaphorize the corpse has backfired (def. 11, 2b). As I mentioned earlier, Freud says that melancholia's withdrawal into the ego of the libido attached to the dead means that there is an "identification of the ego with the abandoned object." He goes on to say: "Thus the shadow of the object fell upon the ego, and the latter could henceforth be judged ... as though it were an object, the forsaken object" (^86). in other words, the failure to metaphorize death objectifies and mortifies the self. With the image of the dead man "curiously and strongly painted" on his psyche, Dickens himself has become figured. Like the dead boy from earlier in the article, Dickens is now engraven, marked with death. This is the full mean- ing of Dickens 's description of the corpse as "disfigured." The terror of this 83</page><page sequence="13">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number 1 experience comes from Dickens s failed attempt to get the cadaver to act as a trope. This "disfigurement" cannot be made the vehicle for any truth exceeding its own material presence but only leads insistently back to itself as the end instead of the means of signification. What we are left with, then, is a corpse that refuses to be made an allegorical sign for the abstract, metaphysical condi- tion of death. Instead, it denies that death is anything other than what remains in the material world. Death cannot safely be defined, confined, or expelled from the material world but remains omnipresent in its baths, theatres, and clothiers - its places of entertainment, spectacle, and commodity exchange. It is in this light that we can best understand Dickens s belief that the corpse is spreading its "contamination"; the corpse taints the material world with death until everything Dickens sees is "something like him!" (198). The only figure Dickens can ultimately reach is the one in which the material world resembles death. Dickens 's last morgue article, "Some Recollections of Mortality" (1863), represents the culmination of his experiences: Dickens has rejected the French ability to deal with the morgue as part of the market; he has been unable to make it part of a satisfactory narrative; he has been psychologically decimated by the morgue; and now he will attempt to recover by adopting the very French narrative he initially dismissed. This final article begins with Dickens aimlessly wandering around Paris, speculating on the relationship of aesthetics to political history - that is, whether a "capital must be ensnared and enslaved before it can be made beautiful" ( 102) .While wondering about this connection between beauty and death, Dickens discovers himself in front of Notre Dame and notices that the area has been undergoing some civic improvements: "I had left that space covered with buildings and now it was cleared for some new wonder .... Only the obscene little Morgue, slinking on the brink of the river and soon to come down, was left there, looking mortally ashamed of itself and supremely wicked" ( 102). This personification of the morgue as "mortally ashamed of itself" plays off the idea of "mortal" as both human and marked by death. As Paris tries to rescue itself from its violent history by changing its physical appearance, the morgue lingers to remind the city that its materiality is always already marked with death. As if to underscore this connection, Dickens sees a "procession . . . dancing round the cathedral in the liveliest manner." Assuming it is a "marriage ... or a Christening, or some other domestic festivity" that is typical of "Blouse-life," as Dickens here labels the Parisian lifestyle, he decides to join it (102). However, instead of the kind of communal festival that would fit the city's new facade, Dickens discovers that the procession is a "Body coming to the Morgue." It is interesting to note that Dickens capitalizes both "Body" and "Blouse," as if they were allegorical or proper names. It is consistent with the education Dickens has been undergoing that he does not see the corpse as "Death" but only as "Body." He is learning that the corpse will not be a sign for anything outside its own materiality. At the same time, the living people become metonym- 84</page><page sequence="14">bianca tredennick: Some Collections of Mortality ically dehumanized, reduced to mere "Blouses," a telling designation given Dickens 's later description of the morgue's display as containing a "quantity of clothes." Making the transition from wedding or christening party to morgue procession without a pause, Dickens decides, "having never chanced upon this initiation," to "constitute [himjself a Blouse likewise, and [run] into the Morgue with the rest" (103). Forced to wait outside while the custodians take charge of the body, the crowd becomes "excited in the highest degree by seeing the Custodians pull off their coats and tuck up their shirt-sleeves .... It looked so interestingly like business" (103). The image represents the corpse as commodity and the morgue attendants as merchants, a representation underscored by the head custodian's reassurance to the crowd that the body will be "exposed pres- ently .... He will be exposed in good time" (104). Given the definition of "to expose" as "to put up for sale," we can see that the morgue attendants, by treating the corpse as a commodity, seem to create agency for the living. That is, the corpse seems to become a physical object exchanged among the living, just as the city's death-haunted material structure is exchanged for a better one ("Expose," def. 7a). Indeed, Dickens 's attitude toward the corpse seems different in the open- ing pages of this article. As if reeling from his last, destructive encounter with the large dark corpse and searching for a stable place from which to rescue agency, Dickens claims membership with the same French crowd that he had derided in "Railway Dreaming" and "Travelling Abroad." As we saw in "Railway Dreaming," this crowd shares the custodian's ability to rationalize the corpse as a marketable commodity. Having handed over the commodity, they now wait to consume it. This accounts for Dickens 's images of the "ravenous" crowd (103). One man "got his coat-collar between his teeth, and bit at it with an appetite," while a mother, "pretending to bite the forefinger of her baby-boy, kept it between her rosy lips" (104). Stone reads these images as evidence of cannibalism's lure for Dickens, but I believe these images of hunger and eating indicate that the corpse incites a desire for consumption, not merely in the gustatory meaning of the word but also in the economic denotation. The crowd fills the gap until they can consume the corpse by creating and consuming a narrative for it: "Was it river, pistol, knife, love, gambling, robbery, hatred, how many stabs, how many bullets, fresh or decomposed, suicide or murder? All wedged together, and all staring at one another with our heads thrust forward, we propounded these inquiries and a hundred more such" (103). Having handed the commodity over to the attendants, they create a story about the corpse that itself becomes an object of exchange. When told by a man that the body is merely that of a "poor old man, passing along the street under one of the new buildings, on whom a stone had fallen" (103), they rescue their control by forming into subgroups "without separation from the mass," each of which continues to exchange narratives (10^): Ss</page><page sequence="15">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number 1 An old man was not much: moreover, we could have wished he had been killed by human agency - his own, or somebody else's: the latter, preferable - but our comfort was, that he had nothing about him to lead to his identification, and that his people must seek him here. Perhaps they were waiting dinner for him even now? We liked that. (103) The crowd does not like the facts of the case and creates a new narrative; their dissatisfaction lies in the very fact that the man's death is not attribut- able to human agency. Instead of the corpse as commodity offering a way for the living to control the dead, the crowd s investment in commodities disempowers them. It does so because, as we have seen earlier, the crowd s disproportionate desire for the dead is itself a form of commodity fetishism, which treats commodities as subjects capable of acting on their own. This collision between a stone from a new building and the commodified man challenges any notion that the material city can transcend the deathly. To tear down one material structure and replace it with another is not to replace the deathly with the vital. Instead, the very fact of the Parisians' elevation of the material guarantees that the material will be marked with death. A society that cannot redeem the materiality of the corpse and that defines itself by its own materiality - its stones, its construction, and its products - is a society of death, a necropolis. The mob is temporarily let back into the morgue, only to be told that the body is not yet ready. Here, an alternate reading of "expose" as "to exhibit" or "to display" allows us to interpret the custodian's next comment ("Expose"). He recommends that the crowd "entertain yourselves in the meanwhile with the other curiosities. Fortunately, the Museum is not empty today" (104). The use of the word museum is notable. It shows that the custodian's agency takes the form of curating an exhibit of the dead.1 Unlike Dickens 's previous portrayal of the attendants as nearly indistinguishable from the bodies, this custodian seems to control the display ("Railway" 17^). Indeed, when the body is finally added to the exhibit, Dickens records that the custodian has a "certain placid meritorious air of not being proud, though high in office" (106). This proprietary, confident stance in relation to the dead is something we have not seen Dickens ascribe to anyone thus far. As we have already seen, this association of the museum with death is not unique to Dickens or limited to his time. Twentieth-century critics often make just such a connection. Adorno explains that the German word mused ["museumlike"] has unpleasant overtones. It describes objects to which the observer no longer has a vital relationship and which are in the process of dying. They owe their preservation more to historical respect than to the needs of the present. Museum and mausoleum are connected by more than 86</page><page sequence="16">bianca tredennick: Some Collections of Mortality phonetic association. Museums are like the family sepulchres of works of art. (17^) More recently, Tony Bennett has made a related claim: "In the modern his- tory museum . . . objects are typically displayed with a view to rendering present and visible that which is absent and invisible: the past history" ( 166) . In both of these quotations, we find that the museum seems to preserve the dead past, containing it in one place and thus delineating it from the present. Through its investment in those material remains, however, it privileges the dead as that which defines the present. The "needs of the present" are subsumed by the presence of the dead ( 17^). In short, the museum commodities its objects just as the morgue commodifies its corpses, by investing the material object with a significance whose illusory metaphysicality tacitly reveals our inability to transcend its physicality. The agency that Dickens hoped to regain is thus flawed, at best. When the corpse finally makes its appearance, Dickens explains, "there was a much more general, purposeless, vacant staring at it - like looking at wax-work, without a catalogue, and not knowing what to make of it. But all these expressions concurred in possessing the one underlying expression of looking at something that could not return a look" ( 106, emphasis original) .This image of the dead as aesthetic object on display in a museum has a double effect. On the one hand, viewers of the dead are reaffirmed in their agency; they live and observe as subjects while the corpses are mere objects of the crowd's gaze. They are spectacles, as Dickens's repeated use of the word show indicates. On the other hand, something less comforting also happens in this description. Confronted with the actual sight of the body, Dickens's desire to consume is "sated at a glance." He begins to distance himself from both corpse and crowd, reflecting stiffly that "it was strange to see so much heat and uproar seething about one poor spare white-haired old man, quiet for evermore." Interestingly, Dickens does not try to rescue an authoritative position by metaphorizing or narrativizing the corpse, but turns his critical eye on the crowd. He contrasts the crowd's "general, purposeless, vacant staring" with his own subjective "looking" ( 10^). Indeed, the crowd now seems more dead than the corpse, disempowered not only by Dickens's gaze but also by the corpse itself, which becomes a cultural artifact requiring expert decoding. "Without a catalogue," the crowd is baffled by the corpse's privileged status as ambiguous art object. Of course, Dickens is implicated in this process; he shares the crowd's confu- sion about the "dreadfully mysterious . . . spectacle" of the dead ( 107). Unable to escape the corpse's materiality, to translate that materiality into a metaphysical truth, or to objectify and control the corpse's materiality, Dickens is left with an "experience ... of the Morgue kind" ( 107) . He has learned that the dead are never just the objects of the living subject's gaze; the dead always look back. This last article on the morgue provides the final transition from Dickens's attempts at authorial control to Dickens as elegist of the morgue itself. Written the year 87</page><page sequence="17">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number 1 before the morgue's demolition, this essay serves as its epitaph. Blanchot says that "the image becomes the follower of the object, what comes after it, what remains of it and allows us to have it still available to us when nothing is left of it" (86). As some of the few detailed, first-hand English accounts of the morgue, Dickens 's articles are just such imagistic followers. The text is now itself the engraven marker of death, the material remains of the Paris Morgue. Notes 1 The connection between morgue and museum was actually a common one at the time. Indeed, the Paris Morgue was familiarly known as the Musée de la Mort. See Vanessa Schwartz's chapter on the Musée Grevin, the famous Parisian wax museum, which had an entire room devoted to mockups of the morgue. Works Cited Abraham, Nicholas, and Maria Torok.
