Material Events: Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory - eleven essays by Andrzej Warminski, Michael Sprinker, Arkady Plotnitsky, T. J. Clark, Tom Cohen, Laurence Rickels, J. Hillis Miller, Barbara Johnson, Ernesto Laclau, Judith Butler, and Jacques Derrida - addresses the question, why Paul de Man, today?1 In seeking to address this issue the purpose is, in part, to reprogram the reception of de Man, and to open the reading of de Man beyond his own texts towards a future critical activity concerned with the question of materiality. This is not, however, to paraphrase Marc Redfield [50], a collection which addresses directly the politics of de Man's reception thus far, although, inevitability, such an assessment haunts these pages. It is, instead, concerned with the question of materiality in response to a certain perceived return in the humanities to pre- or anti-theoretical habits in the name of politics which, in the words of the editors, has the appearances of a return to the "re-politicization of critical interests and a supposed 'return' to history, to all variety of identity politics, and to divergent definitions of cultural studies." The essays of Material Events treat issues as diverse as the material sub- lime, art and ideology, the possible relations between quantum theory and de Man's late essays in terms of a nonclassical epistemology, the paintings of Cézanne, the matter of psychoanalytic transference, the disruptive re-marking of a material trace in the films of Alfred Hitchcock, the politics of rhetoric, the op- eration of anthropomorphism in lyric poetry and legal discourse in the constitu- tion of the "person," the debate between "constructivist and essentialist notions of sexual difference" read against the trope of the body and the materiality of writing in Descartes, and Rousseau and confession. Each asks us to consider the following: How, in response to the text of de Man, is the reader of this text, cit- ing a remark of Derrida' s à propos of de Man,2 to move beyond a modality of analysis defined as that act of citation which implies an "ulterior author or text?" How is the reader to institute performatively a "new concept and a new con- tract" with the materiality of the word, which would, in turn, install a critical machinery that, in intervening with the abjection of the de Manian text in the 113</page><page sequence="2">today of recent critical studies, re-program the response to de Man in its en- gagement with his rethinking of materiality, while, through its own strategic inscription, opening on to the unprogrammable, the event of "alternative fu- tures," as the editors put it? In considering these matters, this volume involves itself in an uncanny dia- logue with the work of Paul de Man. One aspect of that uncanniness is the way in which the collection brings before us, so faithfully and, yet, so disturbingly, the powerful, haunting contours of de Man's text. This group of essays resonates with the spirit of de Man in a very material fashion. Yet this revenance, if one may be permitted to identify or apprehend what is at work here in this way, is not simply a question of paying a certain homage. There is a much more critical spirit at work throughout the essays gathered in the name of Paul de Man and in the name of Material Events, of which, reading this title, we may suggest this collection is one such event. Indeed, to be more precise, the title names a collec- tivity rather than collection as the plural indicates, a material intervention, gath- ering together particular critical events in the shape of singular responses from that peculiar academic event, where programming and the unpredictable come together, the conference.3 More difficult to express through the medium of a review is the sense that the uncanny disturbance of these essays can be appre- hended if one acknowledges that this is neither simply identifiable as wholly a collection with a shared theme, nor as eleven wholly singular essays, each ab- solutely separable from the system or organization in which they find them- selves inscribed. There is therefore already an effect of doubling and of displacement in op- eration here, with a concomitant efficacity of redoubling consonant with, yet not reducible to, the rhythms of the text of Paul de Man. Working within the tradi- tional confines of such a collection, and in relation to certain formalizable laws pertinent to what is described by Arkady Plotnitsky as the conventional or clas- sical "representation of the 'collective,'" there is nonetheless, and as part of a recognizable gambit with which Material Events plays, the very serious matter of a certain difference, of specific differences, of differences within and from themselves, at work. Linked inescapably to the protocols by which conference collections formulate themselves and subsequently generate an identity as the prosthesis of the originating instance, the gathering of essays, while remaining connected, is, nevertheless, only partially definable in such conventional terms, whether one recognizes the indebtedness to the origin that is the conference or the text of Paul de Man. This collective arrives with its various effects (as Plot- nitsky puts it, in a very different context, "collectively lawful and individually lawless") fully in play as a material manifestation irreducible to some program, which this review, or the idea of the review in general, could then reproduce, represent, paraphrase. I feel myself confronted by a powerful resistance to repre- sentation, which it is in part the purpose of this collection to make the reader 114</page><page sequence="3">see. At the same time, however, in seeking to review Material Events, I am forced to acknowledge that the "radicalization of configuration," as Plotnitsky has it, the discontinuity of this event which I am seeking to come to terms with, is of so radically material a nature that its effects, in being responses to the work of de Man, impose a disfiguring inscription on the present act of writing and that this, furthermore, is very much what Material Events is concerned to bring about. Such efficacity, to cite Plotnitsky once more, "is neither single in gov- erning all of its effects (individual and collective), nor multiple so as to allow one to assign an unambiguously separate efficacity to each lawless individual effect." Thus, one cannot say, for instance, that the bar-effects in Hitchock's films spoken of by Tom Cohen, the static interruptions in recordings discussed by Laurence Rickels, the relationship between body, figurality, and inscription considered by Judith Butler, are either all of the same order or all absolutely dissimilar. Nor can one claim a simple, shared "indebtedness" to the considera- tion of materiality and the materiality of the inscription in Paul de Man. Without making claims towards a representation of de Man, then, and with- out pretending to an ontologico-aesthetic of reproducibility and subsequent ap- plication, the very idea of which is called into question throughout Material Events as an ideological, anthropomorphizing humanist feint beloved of the uni- versity and beyond, the essayists here seek to write in communion with that which is most resonant in de Man's thinking on these questions of figuration and materiality. To borrow from and disfigure somewhat Ernesto Laclau's essay, at a moment in which he addresses the question of historicity in the text of Trot- sky, Material Events concerns itself with those features of de Man's writing "unassimilable" strictly speaking "to any form of repetition," and thereby stands in relation to the spirit of de Man's writing as the serial inscription of "contin- gent displacements which are not retrievable by any of the ... figures of the same." The "pure, irreducible event" of these essays stands in a displaced and contingent relationship to de Man's work at once much more faithful and si- multaneously more risky than any attempted act of formal, mimetic approxima- tion. In Barbara Johnson's essay, "Anthropomorphism in Lyric and Law," the double question of displacement or disfiguration and contingency finds itself articulated around an estranging interrogative concerning the relations between the "laws of genre and the laws of the state." Already, from this remark, those familiar with de Man should be aware of a certain fidelity on Johnson's part to matters of troping and transformation, as well as to the impossibility of assign- ing questions of materiality "exclusively either in language ... or in the world." The spirit in this work is double, then, at least, and all the more disruptive for that. For, to identify provisionally such doubling, while not limiting its effi- cacity to two locations, it is that which both pervades de Man's own critical ne- gotiations, particularly around the question of materiality, while being, also, the spirit in which the critics represented here respond to the spirit and the letter of 115</page><page sequence="4">de Man's later writings, as already intimated. The spectral resonance of de Man's text is all the more profound when one considers, as the editors suggest we do, the current critical silence surrounding matters of historiality and materi- ality in relation to de Man's own thinking on these intertwined subjects. As the introduction has it: "what remains unengaged in de Man's text [on the part of current criticism] addresses the possibility of intervention in ... the program- ming of the 'historial,' and a treatment of 'materiality' that compels a rethinking of technicity and the 'sensorium' on the basis of inscription." That which goes unread haunts this collection of essays as a spectral trace-recording, reiteratively enunciating, in other words, that remark of Hamlet's father: "remember me." If we remember that which, until this collection, remains unengaged, we are, sug- gest the editors, directed towards "an approach, given the 'materiality of in- scription,' to the notion of the 'virtual' . . . and hence, toward alternative histo- ries." It is precisely the iterability of a spectro-technicity defined by Laurence Rickels in his contribution to this collection as the "breakdowns," "scratches," or "static" involved simultaneously in the transmission of and resistance to the text of particular de Mans. If we pause momentarily with Rickels' s vertiginous performance concerning the nature of "Resistance in Theory," as his title has it, we can understand the necessity for returning to de Man, and returning de Man's thinking on materiality, to the critical scene. Rickels multiplies the doubling of resistance and transmission in fascinating ways, thereby emphasizing the tech- nological aspects of the institutional-critical machinery, by drawing out the vari- ous resistances in and to theory, along with a certain de Manian resistance to psychoanalysis, and, en passant, the generalized reception/resistance in the Uni- versity around Adorno and Benjamin concerning their "Freudian formation" which, as Rickels aptly puts it "repeats or displaces what begins as a resistance in their own theorization." While I might argue over the dialectic choice opera- tive in the articulation of "or," preferring to understand the operation as both repetition and displacement, Rickels nonetheless speaks convincingly of aca- demic-institutional machinery and the ways in which it works repeatedly. There is thus readable in this analysis exactly the kind of alternative history desired by the editors concerning mnemotechnic suppression and the materiality of inscrip- tion vis-à-vis the institutional domestication of the critical event. There is at work, as the institution's material effect, an impersonal, inhuman forgetting of otherness or alterity when the other makes the difference of its het- erogeneous inscription most materially felt. But, then, as Rickels so cogently points out - and we only need to consider the reception of and resistance to de Man - "[e]very recent past will still be the most repressed." This remark speaks volumes, such is its internal, structural haunting. There is thus in Rickels' s writing - and this is to be seen in different ways throughout the essays of Mate- rial Events - a spectral resonance, a performative oscillation directing our atten- 116</page><page sequence="5">tion in different directions, while opening to our view, in a now well-known phrase of Derrida's, "the structurality of structure." Everywhere at work, and yet nowhere visible as such, the materiality of inscription serves to redirect our at- tention, once we learn to turn our attention patiently to such material events. In addressing the question of materiality, Material Events effects an irrevo- cable transformation, of the kind so often defined by de Man himself, in the textual field. This is significant, not least in that it gives the reader attentive to such nuances an awareness of both the extent to which this collection is the manifestation of a certain critical spirit, as well as a response to that spirit. The significance lies also in the fact that the manifestation and response effect the transformation already spoken of, in order to speak of Paul de Man and thereby move elsewhere, in order to be open to what could be called the past that is the initial production of the de Manian text, and, in transformative, performative fashion, to direct one towards the future "afterlife" (as the book's title has it) of that text. Hence, Material Events. The title, already briefly discussed, names a material intervention which is both its own and not simply its own. For the intervention around the name and text of Paul de Man is, on the one hand, multiple and various, amongst the vari- ous contributors' responses and readings. We cannot speak here of a single in- tervention, even though the volume appears as a collective gathering, gathered in the name of Paul de Man. On the other hand, the interventions might also be named inventions of de Man: reinventions of the de Manian critical spirit, and inventions in the spirit of de Man's own material interventions in the act of reading, which may further be read as the traces of a spectral de Manian inter- vention in the present interpretive processes. The haunting which de Man's text inflicts upon this collection has clearly produced a material event, or, rather, several, so that, in the effort to respond to de Man on the question of materiality, the act of critical reading becomes materially transformed in often startling and unpredictable ways to become the event inaugurated from some other place and as the response open to the ethical obligation which haunts all good reading, as the responsibility to the other. And, in being open to the reception, the partial reading of the other's trace, each of the essays here opens itself in the event of its reading to the event to come. Each opens itself in exemplary fashion to that which remains to be read in the text of de Man as the future of an other criti- cism. What we read here is the return of a ghost of criticism coming from a pos- sible future of critical reading, concerning itself with reading and reading's im- possibilities, as well as the material effects of reading no longer caught, through some facile involvement or engagement with a question of politics or history, in a double relapse: into, on the one hand, aesthetics, or, on the other, anthropo- morphism. If there appears here to be a tricky negotiation between past and present, simply called, this is not accidental. For Material Events concerns itself indi- 117</page><page sequence="6">rectly with temporality, with time and with timing, if not also with the material effect of a disabling, disruptive anachrony: thus, the intervention of the event, where the time for reading, the time for close reading or the careful reading of Paul de Man (in both senses of that phrase, as though the phrase were haunted by itself from within by a double genitive), appears to be out of joint. There is no time to read with the attention that Paul de Man once gave to texts; certainly, that time - what might crudely be called the time of deconstruction - has passed. For, the collection implicitly, and yet provocatively (and so all the more haunt- ingly) asks, who, today, has the time to take the time to read, recognizing all the while, as did Paul de Man acknowledging Pascal, that finding the right time for reading is impossible? Who can read so carefully, especially around the question of tropes, or the matter of rhetoric, when the question, today (a today the time of which is yet to be read) much more obviously at stake in the academy and within departments conventionally concerned with literature is that of politics and its alleged cognate materiality? (Of course, to assume materiality as a cog- nate of politics is to assume we know what politics is, what we mean when we use the term politics; this, in itself, points to the problem of what happens when you read too quickly, or, perhaps, when you bring reading to a halt in the name of urgency.) Few of the essays in Material Events address this matter directly, even though the editors' introduction does confront the different todays of dif- ferent critical modes in relation to the particular case of the abjection of Paul de Man, as a material instance of the attempted erasure of questions of reading from a certain perspective in the name of politics. However, despite the absence of sustained polemical engagement in conventional terms, everywhere in Mate- rial Events the question of the politics of reading is broached, and specifically through what is meant exactly when one talks of materiality in general, or the materiality of inscription in particular. And if it is a question of a politics of reading, the question is also one, very much involved with the attempt to read differently or otherwise, as a politics of the de Manian text. As Michael Sprinker points out in a comparison between de Manian and Althusserian comprehensions of the relations of art and ideology, it is necessary to comprehend the extent to which de Man's reading of tropes and their "coer- cive but non-rational power" is not simply some formalist gesture but is, instead, profoundly ideological in import. Sprinker transforms our understanding of the politics imminent in the attention to "the seductively mystifying power of tropes," and thereby reorients de Man for the reader in political terms, as do Tom Cohen and J. Hillis Miller. As Miller reminds us, de Man's text "contains cheerfully taunting rejections, explicit or implicit, of 'our' most basic ideologi- cal assumptions, the ones 4we' most need to get on with our work, the ones the university most needs to get on with its work." Cohen demonstrates how de Man links "the 'humanism' of Schiller ... to that aesthetic education which still de- fines 'liberal education' today, the University surely, and the 'aesthetic state' . . . 118</page><page sequence="7">[which] values transparency and communication, and the pretense of 'liberal humanism.'" In summarizing de Man's critique, Cohen's remark offers a telling destabilizing performative motion along a synecdochic chain, coming finally to the figure par excellence of ideological illusion. In the process, he assumes in other words that aspect of de Manian critique which, in tracing what Laclau terms the "politico-tropological" articulation, makes appear the aestheticization of the shared political identity that is so troubled by de Man. When Ernesto La- clau remarks that "[t]he overdetermined nature of all political difference or identity opens the space for a generalized tropological movement and thus re- veals the fruitfulness of de Man's intellectual project for ideological and politi- cal analysis," we begin to recognize that the place to which we should return as the site ready for "politico-tropological" analysis is the textual reception of Paul de Man since his death. In the wake of de Man, and as the responsibility to the afterlife of theory haunted by the de Manian signature and demand, imagining a politics of materi- ality differently is, a necessary, if difficult, task, as these essays make clear if one is to resist the retrograde slip into an anthropomorphizing humanism gov- erned by, and, in turn, governing, the aesthetic ideology, by which much current, empirically oriented criticism is driven despite various overt statements of poli- tics and in the name of those politics against the alleged formalism wielded in (too) many narratives concerning "theory in the seventies." The essays of Mate- rial Events return repeatedly to the notion of pre-phenomenal materiality in its various de Manian manifestations to avoid the epistemo-political regressions and totalizations reliant - what is referred to in the volume as a Schillerian re- lapse - on notions of an anteriority to which all writing is seen as referring (as is suggested in the introduction, "whatever inscription designates, it conjures sheer anteriority") or is otherwise subordinate. In response to the relapse readable in certain aspects of current politicized criticisms, what is required as a counter- signature to such aesthetico-epistemological retrenchments, à propos of de Man, the editors argue, is, following and in relation to de Man's own irreversible turn to the materiality of inscription, a responsible and appropriative, quasi- Benjaminian act of "materialistic historiography," a "rewriting of the archive [which, as a necessary and somewhat urgent return to the irreversibility of the de Manian text] stands to intervene in received narratives, with the aim of option- ing alternative pasts, and hence futures." At the same time, one must also be attentive to what Derrida defines as that which is "non-reappropriable, radically resistant to the logic of the proper." This is nothing other than the effort to read, today, the non-reappropriable, on the one hand, in the essays of Paul de Man, particularly those of Aesthetic Ideology, and, on the other, in the essays of Material Events. Resistant to any reading which seeks to recuperate them into an organic totality in the form of a "theory," de Man's final articles - and the essays in the volume considered here - leave a 119</page><page sequence="8">discernible, material trace. They produce startling, unpredictable effects, trans- formations in the act of criticism. The persistence of such material and the mate- riality of such persistence is undeniable, indelible even. The eleven essays in this collection show the signs of such material efficacity, and they do so, moreover, each in their own performative fashion, while transforming de Man in ways which are as unexpected as de Man's own radical reconfigurations of the notion of materiality.
