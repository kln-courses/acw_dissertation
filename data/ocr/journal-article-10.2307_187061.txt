<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS it remains a mystery how excursions into speculative metaphysics (Towers) or descriptive metaphysics (Chisholm) could ever contribute to resolving or even illuminating moral problems in medicine. In fairness to the contributors, it should be noted that this book is an edited collection of the proceedings of a conference-the Third Trans-Disciplinary Symposium on Philosophy and Medicine, held at the University of Connecticut Health Center in December 1975. This publication bears out a point that is becoming increasingly evident as conferences in medical ethics continue to abound: proceedings of symposia rarely yield coherent, well-ordered sets of essays. In this case, the fault lies not so much with the individual contributors, some of whose essays provide careful analyses of topics central to medical ethics. Examples are the papers by Albert Jonsen, "Do No Harm: Axiom of Medical Ethics," and "Medical Experimentation: The Consent of Prisoners and Children," by Natalie Abrams. Both of these essays explore their respective topics using the familiar tools and techniques of philosophical ethics. Jonsen examines the logic of justification in various sorts of discussions about medical ethics where the "do no harm" maxim is invoked. Abrams engages in a largely conceptual analysis of the notions of coercion and freedom, threats and offers, drawing some conclusions about voluntariness and consent in situations where prisoners serve as experimental subjects. These two authors tease out a few normative conclusions from their respective analyses of concepts and justificatory arguments, but neither goes as far in this respect as the reader might hope. While philosophically competent, Abrams' paper will undoubtedly lack appeal for practitioners of medicine. One contributor who does go beyond traditional philosophical analysis is Sidney Morgenbesser, also writing on the subject of human experimentation. Morgenbesser's lucid article is a nice mix of philosophical argument, appeal to relevant empirical facts, and moral reasoning. It is probably the most exemplary essay in the book for its success in portraying the nature and significance of philosophical medical ethics. That the book as a whole lacks coherence is the fault of its editors, who designed the symposium from which it emerged. There are seven separate sections. It is little wonder that headings such as "Special Rights and Duties: From Euthanasia to Experimentation," "Changing Human Nature: Medicine in the Service of Virtue," along with those mentioned earlier, cover a range of unrelated issues. If anything emerges clearly after reading this book, it is that there is no such thing as the nature and significance of philosophical medical ethics. For that reason, this volume might be said accurately to represent the current state of the field known as medical ethics (which is often not very philosophical). The issues discussed are not always about medicine, nor are they always about ethics. It would hardly be surprising if physicians seeking clarification or guidance about their ethical concerns were to react with puzzlement or scorn at this effort. The one thing that is surely true of this book is that it is of uneven quality. Perhaps this stems from the fact that the conference participants were promised publication of their essays, so unlike other collections whose editors apply selective standards, this work was doomed before it came into print. An equally likely explanation is that the book reflects the general absence of standards in the field as a whole. Medical ethics, being au courant, has become a repository for a range of deviant or unintelligible approaches to moral problems by anyone who chooses to wax philosophical. If those who edit collections such as this do not or cannot apply the same rigorous criteria that obtain in the more traditional areas of philosophy, readers can only hope that publishers will show better judgment.

I shall therefore, restrict myself to comments on a small selection of the essays, indicating in each case why I think each will (or will not) be of interest to readers of this journal. Perhaps the most useful paper is Stanley Gudder's "Four Approaches to Axiomatic Quantum Mechanics." By the classical approach to axiomatic quantum mechanics Gudder means the formulation given the theory by Dirac and von Neumann. Gudder presents three equivalent formulations of this approach, and shows how each formula- tion forms the basis of a new type of axiomatization of the theory. First, there is the algebraic approach, associated mainly with the name of Segal and, in Quantum Field Theory, with the work of Haag and Kastler. One respect in which this extends the classical theory is by the inclusion of more states than are possible when observables are represented by just the self-adjoint operators acting on a separable Hilbert space. In fact there exists an operator A in the Segal algebra with a continuous spectrum ocr(A) and a pure state w such that w(A) = Aeaor(A). Such states are thus reminiscent of the Dirac delta-function. The second approach is one to which Gudder himself has made important contributions. This is the quantum logic approach first fully developed by Mackey, and later extended by Jauch and Piron, and Varadarajan. Because of its abstractness and its mathematical connection with concepts familiar to philosophers, this approach has received much attention. But from a physical point of view the abstractness of quantum logic is a defect. Gudder's discussion of recent attempts to remedy this situation (by showing how space-time symmetries are represented by the logic of a physical system) should therefore be of interest. The last and newest approach to axiomatic foundations-called the convexity approach-treats quantum mechanics as a theory of statistical states and the "mixing" operations one can perform on them. The interested reader should also consult Ludwig's contribution ("A theoretical Description of a Single Micro-System"), since it contains a very extensive motivating discussion for an axiomatization of the theory related to the convexity approach. The paper of Kraus ("Position Observables of the Photon") deals with an interesting peculiarity of massless particles such as photons. Let us say that a photon S is localizable if there exists a position observable and a state w, such that for some finite spatial region V the probability (in co) that S lies in V is 1 and the probability that S lies outside of V is zero. It was shown by Wigner and Newton in 1949 that there is no self adjoint operator, representing position, under which S is localizable. A more recent result of G. Hegerfeldt (1974) (Physical Review D 10 3320) shows that in the case of relativistic quantum theory localizability is incompatible with a certain causality condition: roughly the condition that if S is localized in V at t = 0, at time t &gt; 0 S is localized in the region V, = (x: distance (V, x) -&lt; ct}). On any view the results are surprising. But their significance is far from clear. On one interpretation they show that the concept of the position of S makes no sense quantum mechanically. A more sober view claims that the difficulty is largely technical and points to the necessity of extending the set of operators representing position observables. This is the approach explored by Kraus. Unfortunately Kraus does not discuss Hegerfildt's theorem. Readers familiar with the recent philosophical and mathematical literature on hidden variables will be disappointed by Kuryshkin's paper "Uncertainty Principle and the Problems of Joint Coordinate-Momentum Probability Density in Quantum Mechanics." Kuryshkin rejects without argument the requirement that the algebraic structure of even the partial algebra of operators acting on a Hilbert space be preserved by the commutative algebra of random variables. Finally, I would recommend the papers of Rylov and Lanz; the former for its clear exposition of the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics, the latter for its discussion of measurement and the phenomenon of quantum non-separability. In connection with Lanz's paper, it is claimed that if two spin-1/2 particles S, S' are in the singlet spin state I, we cannot suppose that the composite system S + S' consists of sub-systems with separate properties. This is meant as an objection to 337</page><page sequence="3">338 BOOK REVIEWS Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen's interpretation of composite systems. As far as I can tell, the only basis for this claim is that F is not a product of pure states of S and S'. But it is quite obscure why Lanz (or d'Espagnat, whose account Lanz follows) should think that the separability of S and S' in this sense (i.e. t = a ? B3') is in any way required by the above interpretation. William Demopoulos, The University of Western Ontario. FREDERICK GREGORY. Scientiftc Materialism in Nineteenth Century Germany. Studies in the History of Modern Science, Volume 1. Dordrecht, Holland and Boston: D. Reidel, 1977. xxii + 279 pp. $28.00 cloth, $13.50 paper. Gregory's book is a study of the school of scientific materialism which flourished in Germany after the failure of liberal revolution of 1848. The bulk of the work is concerned with the popular scientific writings, materialist propaganda and the political activities of the three principal exponents of scientific materialsim: Karl Vogt, Jacob Molleschott and Ludwig Buichner. The book is primarily a historical study of the interconnections between science, metaphysics, religion and politics in Germany in the period from 1840 to 1860. It does, however, raise some interesting questions concerning the sources and scope of German materialism in the nineteenth century, its relation to the science of the period and the legitimacy of appealing to scientific theories in order to support political and ethical value-judgments. The book is divided into three parts. The two chapters of Part One discuss the influence of Ludwig Feuerbach on German materialism and the reaction against the materialists in the 1850's. Part Two deals in detail with the turbulent careers of Vogt, Molleschott and Biichner and their prolific (and often prolix) writings. A novel feature of Gregory's account is his inclusion of the "irrefiihrender" materialist, Heinrich Czolbe. Part Three is devoted to "Issues." The character of this section is indicated by its chapter headings: "Of Philosophy and Science," "Controversies in Biology" and "Materialism and Society." In Part One Gregory argues that the father of German materialism was Ludwig Feuerbach. More than the writings of any other figure, it was Feuerbach's attack on Hegelian idealism and his expose of Christianity as the anthropomorphic projection of human needs and desires which inspired the anti-clerical, anti-theological, anti-idealist and anti-authoritarian spirit of the materialist movement. For the materialists, Feuerbach had shown the vacuity of using suprasensual, transcendent concepts instead of providing genuine explanations grounded on scientific facts and observable phenomena. My only reservation about this section is that there is perhaps too much emphasis on Feuerbach and too little on science. As Gregory himself admits, Vogt probably did not read Feuerbach until after his views had been formed. Also the influence of Feuerbach on the materialists was at least reciprocal. It was, for example, only in his 1850 review of Moleschott's Die Lehre der Nahrungsmittel that Feuerbach first unequivocally espoused scientific materialism and coined the notorious pun, "Der Mensch ist was er isst." The materialists touched a sensitive nerve in German culture. They were regarded as a potent threat to traditional religion, conservative morality and the political authority of the Prussian state. Clerics, both Protestant and Catholic denounced their atheism; Neo-Kantians such as Frauenstadt, Lange and Meyer criticized their dogmatic meta- physics and naive epistemology; Fischer, a right-wing Hegelian, defended free-will and morality against the assaults of determinism; Liebig, Wagner and Schleiden condemned the superficiality of the materialists' popularisations of science and the legitimacy of the inferences they drew from them concerning the non-existence of any immaterial soul in human beings, vital forces in living organisms or spiritual purpose in nature. All three members of the materialist triumvirate lost their jobs because of their views. Vogt, who at the time was Professor of Zoology at the University of Giessen, was expelled from Germany after the collapse of the Frankfurt National Assembly to which he had been an elected delegate; Moleschott was forced to resign</page></plain_text>
