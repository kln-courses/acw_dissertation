ABSTRACT The advent of the Hybrid III crash test dummy marked the beginning of biofidelic anthropomorphic test devices. During the development of its critical components, notably the head, neck, knee, and thorax, biomechanlcal cadaver test results were incorporated into the design. The result was a dummy that represented the 50th percentile male during idealized impacts. In order to achieve a more biofidelic response from the components, many exotic materials and unique designs were utilized. The thorax, for instance, incorporates a spring steel rib design laminated with a viscoelastic polymeric composite material to damp the response. This combination results in the proper hysteretic losses necessary to model the human thorax under impact loading conditions. The disadvantage of this design is that the damping material properties are highly sensitive to temperature. A variation of more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit dramatically affects the response of the thorax. Under the hot photographic lights associated with crash testing, it is difficult to maintain the mandated 70 degree to 72 degree Fahrenheit dummy temperature window. To examine the cause of temperature dependence, physical testing was performed on individual Hybrid III ribs to characterize the damping material, and a finite element model was formulated. Results from both the physical testing and the simulations using the finite element model showed 20 to 30% variation in sternal deflection over a temperature of 63 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit. Close examination of the damping material characterization showed that its Young's Modulus dropped nearly an entire order of magnitude across the temperature range. This variation greatly affected the overall stiffness of the rib during impact and is the leading cause of the thorax temperature dependence. INTRODUCTION In July 1975, GM officially undertook the development of the Hybrid III. The new ATD focused on the deficiencies seen in the Hybrid II and ATD 502. These drawbacks could be categorized into three areas. The most important of these deficiencies was the lack of a biomechanical response from the neck, thorax, and knees. None of these features sufficiently modeled data taken from cadaver testing. Second, previous designs did not allow for the measurement of biomechanical parameters. Such parameters included neck axial and shear loads and sternal displacement. These measurements were critical for injury criteria. Finally, a deficiency was also seen in the area of engineering and production documentation. Neither were deemed sufficiently detailed in order for exact reproduction of dummies. Redesign and production of the Hybrid III has been an on going process since 1975. As cadaver data becomes available and engineering techniques and materials improve, the Hybrid III continuously evolves. In 1983, GM petitioned NHTSA to allow the use of the Hybrid III as an alternative test device for FMVSS 208 compliance testing. NHTSA, pleased with the improved Hybrid III in the areas of impact biofidelity, measurement capabilities, repeatability, and durability incorporated the new design into Part 572 of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards in 1986. The Hybrid III remains the most widely used 50th percentile crash test dummy In the United States. In order to achieve a biofidelic thorax, General Motors incorporated existing biomechanical data into the mechanical design of the dummy. Specifically, the engineers looked at testing initiated in the General Motors Research Laboratories by Dr. Charles K. Kroell. In the early 1970's, Dr. Kroell examined the effect of blunt impacts on the human thorax. To conduct his 880</page><page sequence="2">study, fourteen unembalmed cadavers and one embalmed cadaver were subject to sternal blows from a 6-in diameter impactor. The impactor varied in weight from 3.6 to 52 lbs and ranged in speeds of 14 to 32 mph; the higher speeds being associated with the smaller weights. Cadavers were placed in a seated position, with their chest leaning against the front of the impactor face. They were otherwise unrestrained. The impactor was aligned to the mid-sternal region. During impact, high speed photography and accelerometers recorded the dynamics of the test. From this data, a wide range of correlations was established; the most important of these was the human thoracic force-deflection curve. Kroell's data was spread amongst a wide range of body types. To standardize the data towards the 50th percentile male, R. Neathery examined Kroell's original fifteen experiments plus an additional twenty-three. Using the Buckingham % theorem for non-dimensional analysis, he redefined the data and established two sets of biofidelic corridors for the 50lh percentile male. These corridors are based on a 51.5 lb impactor at 14 "4^ and 22 n4ec impacting a 164 pound adult male. This was the standard to be used by General Motors engineers in developing the thorax for the Hybrid III dummy. The thorax of the Hybrid III consists mainly of spring steel bent into the shape of a rib and fixed to a hardened steel spinal column. To achieve the design goal of matching Neathery's force-deflection corridors, damping material was adhered to the inner portion of the rib. This gave the thorax a more accurate biofidelic response than steel alone. The dampened rib produced a force- deflection curve that gave a rather good fit when compared to Neathery's corridors. Although the addition of damping material increased the biofidelity of the thorax during frontal impact, it also initiated several new issues with the Hybrid III. Such problems included separation of the damping material and steel at the adhesion surface, crack formation in the damping material after several impacts, and strong dummy core temperature dependence. The former two problems have been investigated and were solved by substitution of materials. However, the latter, dummy core temperature dependence remains an issue today. During crash testing involving the Hybrid III, it is mandated that the dummy must remain at 70.7 °F. Although a slight temperature variation of +/- 1.0 °F is permitted during testing, temperature variations of 5.0 °F or more will drastically affect the behavior of the damping material, thereby invalidating the test. With the high monetary expense of crash testing, the risk of invalidating a test is not an option. For this reason, the dummy, if not the entire test area, must be climate controlled to 70.7 °F. This has become quite an expense associated with dummy testing. Dummy manufactures are interested in identifying the causes of this temperature dependence and eliminating its effect on thorax response; thereby reducing the stringent tolerance on dummy temperature. The key behind the thorax is its unique rib design. Comprised of SAE 1075 steel hardened to Rockwell Hardness of 46c, the rib is formed to the shape of a two opposing human ribs, Figure 1. To the inside of both halves of the rib, is adhered a section of United McGill Corporation LD-400, Military Spec P-23653, damping tile. The damping tiles are formed as flat stock. The tiles are machined to specification for the Hybrid III, then bent to form and epoxied on the inside of the steel rib. A 3M 2216 B/A Epoxy is used to adhere the damping material and allowed to cure for 24 hours under uniform pressure. Six rib assemblies of slightly varying dimensions are then bolted to a rigid steel spine box. At the same point is attached a small steel leaf spring. The purpose of the spring is to provide stress control to the steel rib. During deflection, the highest stress concentration in the rib occurs next the attachment point on the spine box. This leaf spring ensures no permanent plastic deformation occurs. All six ribs are then bolted to a polyurethane bib backed by two aluminum stiffeners. The purpose of the bib is to evenly distribute frontal impacts to all six ribs. Located in the bib between the ribs is attached a sternum piece made of Delrin plastic, backed by aluminum. This sternum piece serves two purposes. First, like the polyurethane bib, it helps to distribute frontal impacts evenly to all six ribs. Second, it is part of a sternal deflection measuring mechanism. On the backside of the sternum piece is located a grooved path. A rotary potentiometer mounted near the bottom of the spine box above the lumber region extends toward the sternum piece and a ball joint is fixed in the grooved path. The end result is a measurement of inward (x-direction) displacement of the sternum resulting from frontal loading. A maximum of 3.54 inches of deflection is possible with this arrangement. Figure 1 . Hybrid III Rib Design 881</page><page sequence="3">The pendulum is impacted into the thorax at 22 and 14 fl/sec. The resulting force-deflection curve for each impact is then categorized in terms of thorax load, sternum displacement, and hysteresis. Thorax load is measured from an accelerometer mounted on the opposite end of the pendulum weight from the impact. Multiplying the accelerometer g's by the pendulum weight will give lateral impact force for any moment during the test. Sternum displacement is measured via the rotary potentiometer located within the thorax. Thorax hysteresis is measured from examination of the force-deflection curve. Hysteresis is defined as the irreversible loss of energy during a cycle. In this case, it is defined by the loading and unloading portions of the force-deflection curve. To calculate a percentage, the difference between the area under the loading curve and the area under the unloading curve is divided by the area under the loading curve, Equation 1 . jj . 0/ Area Loa^¡„g ~ Area y„ia0lf¡„g 1AA0/ 1 00% Hysteresis jj . 0/ % x 1AA0/ 1 00% Area Loading Equation 1: Force - Deflection Hysteresis Percentage A graphic depiction of this concept is shown in Figure 2. The dummy is certified if the proper requirements are met for each impact speed. A number of projects have been associated with examining and eliminating the temperature sensitivity of the Hybrid III thorax. Roger Saul classified the degree of temperature dependence in his study, "State of the Art Dummy Selection". Through that study, it was seen that the Hybrid Ill's maximum deflection decreased 34% and increased 43% at temperatures of 65°F and 85°F, respectively. Originally it was thought that the solution to the temperature dependence problem was a rib redesign. Figure 2 : Loading &amp; Unloading Curves Defined in Equation 2. 1 Stahl examined several fiber reinforced thermoplastics. Her hopes were to combine both the steel and damping effects into one material. This newly designed rib would combine the stiffness of SAE 1075 steel and the damping properties of P-23653 Damping Tile. After characterizing and impact testing several materials, none were able to obtain the hysteresis seen in the current design. Goudy examined several redesigns of the rib using the current materials. Such designs included multi- layered rib assemblies and intermittent damping layers. Through finite element modeling and experimental testing, the best result achieved was no improvement over the current design. Additionally, nearly all designs showed relatively the same dependence on temperature. The undertaking of a new finite element model is to once again re-examine the possibility of new exotic materials and unique redesigns. The purpose of this effort is to prove that such a finite element model is possible. Although Goudy experimented using finite element methods, the results were inhibited by the software and computing hardware of that time. The models Goudy examined were not able to produce accurate hysteresis, displacement, or temperature dependency compared to experimental testing. With the passage of the last ten years, new improvements in finite element method and the advent of faster processors have presented the opportunity to produce a more accurate model. PHYSICAL TESTING The key behind modeling is to make it as simple as possible. Modeling the entire dummy thorax would be an arduous task and beyond the scope of this project. Based on previous research and engineering intuition, it was determined that the majority of the thorax response was contributed to the damping material within the rib assembly. For this reason, it was not necessary to examine any other aspect of the dummy thorax. Since the sternum piece and bib distribute the frontal impact evenly to all ribs, it was determined that no single rib received unique loading. Each rib performed relatively the same under a general frontal impact. Thus, only one rib was needed to accurately model the thorax response. It was determined that the #3 rib was the best representation of the Hybrid III thorax. For the finite element model, static analysis ensured that proper geometry had been established. Then dynamic testing was performed to round out the finite element model. In assembling the model, it was important to begin first with a single metal rib with no damping material. This was to ensure that the metal portion of the model was performing within a reasonable tolerance. Next the damping material was added, to finish the model. 882</page><page sequence="4">SINGLE RIB STATIC TESTING The first series of tests performed were simple static tests of a single rib. The testing was performed at the on a United Calibration Corporation force / deflection machine. The rib was mounted The rib was mounted on a block cut to the exact specifications of the spine box contained in the Hybrid III. In order to properly apply even pressure, the sternum piece along with a section of the bib, was left attached between the gap on the front of the rib. Thus, proper constraints were maintained during deflection of the rib. The test configuration is shown in Figure 3. During testing, force was measured as deflection was imposed at a rate of 0.25 inches per minute until a maximum of 3.0 inches displacement was reached. Maximum displacement was held for 30 seconds to ensure equilibrium. Finally, the rib was relieved at a rate of 0.25 inches per minute until 0.00 inches of displacement was reached. Static tests were performed on both the damped rib and metal rib. SINGLE RIB DYNAMIC TESTING During full scale certification testing of the dummy thorax, a majority of the thorax deflection occurs before the inertia of the full dummy is overcome. This means that the rib is more or less rigidly fixed during the impact. Thus, it was assumed that the spine box stays rigidly fixed relative to the ground during the entire impact. Utilizing this basic assumption, it was decided that spine box would be held rigid to the table during dynamic impact. In order to fix the rib's attachment point rigidly to the table, a braced upright was dimensioned to the exact width of the spine box so that any spine box I rib interaction was maintained. An inclined brace was added to insure minimal bending of the upright during impact. Two hex bolts, identical to the ones used for the Hybrid III assembly, fix the rib to the upright. Frontal impact would be imposed through the use of a cabled pendulum with a six inch diameter impact face. The impact speed was controlled with the drop height of the pendulum. The pendulum was released from its Figure 3 : Single Rib Static Test Setup initial resting position and allowed to swing freely into the sternum of the rib. The rib was placed on the table so that the impact occurred at the lowest point during the swing, allowing for constant pendulum velocity immediately before impact. The left and right halves of the rib were attached to the standard sternum piece, which had a thin section of Hybrid III skin on Its front to protect the face of the pendulum. This allowed displacements to be measured with a standard chest potentiometer. Pendulum impact speed was measured with a light trap, and pendulum acceleration and chest displacement were sampled at 10 kHz and passed through a 4 kHz analog filter. After being digitally filtered to 300 Hz, the acceleration data was multiplied by the mass of the pendulum to determine the impact force. Finally, the entire impact event was recorded with high speed photography. Because only a single rib was being impacted it was impossible to use the standard dummy thorax certification test weight of 51.5 pounds. Instead, preliminary testing was performed with the 6.25 lb and 10.3 lb pendulum weight on a damped rib. Using the 6.25 lb weight, it was possible to achieve relatively the same displacement with the same impact velocity as a full dummy test. However, upon examination of the resultant force data, the 6.25 lb weight acquired a considerable amount of vibration due to its lighter weight. This vibration had such an effect on the data that using the 40 Hz filter still resulted in unusable data. The best way to reduce this vibration was to use the heavier 10.3 lb weight with a 40 Hz filter. However, this resulted in slower impact speeds than desired. Regardless, testing proceeded using the 10.3 lb weight at reduced speeds. Figure 4 shows a sample force and deflection plot comparing force data filtered at 300 Hz and 40 Hz. TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY TESTING The vast majority of the temperature sensitivity of the rib Figure 4 Franai IrrpaôFaœ filtered at 300 łfe and 40 Hz 883</page><page sequence="5">is a result of the damping material. Steel properties vary little over a 20°F change in core temperature. For this reason, it was unnecessary to perform temperature sensitivity of the metal rib, and only the damped rib was tested during this phase in testing. The most critical aspect of a temperature sensitivity study is an accurate measure of the rib's core temperature, the surface temperature was brought to the desired temperature and allow sufficient time was allowed for the core to come to equilibrium with the surface. To measure the surface temperature, two Omega Type T Self-Adhering thermocouples were applied to the surface of the rib. One was placed on the outside of the rib in contact with the steel; the other was placed over the damping material. The temperatures were recorded using a personal computer equipped with a LabTech data acquisition system. In order to maintain a specified core temperature in the rib, a temperature chamber was constructed. The chamber measured 3' x 3* and stood 5' in height. It was constructed of plywood and well insulated. A window air conditioner/heater was mounted in the wall of the chamber. The manufacturers controls were modified to allow for a tighter tolerance, computer controlled climate of +/- 1 .0°F. Several hours before impact testing, the entire test stand including rib was placed inside the chamber. The stand was placed on a 12 inch styrofoam block so that no direct conductive heat transfer could occur between the rib and the floor of the chamber. A blanket was placed over the rib to negate the circulatory effects from the air conditioner. The temperature was set and the rib was allowed to come to equilibrium. After equilibrium with the set temperature was reached, the rib and test stand were allowed to soak for an additional hour to ensure equilibrium core temperature. To perform the testing, the rib, test stand, and blanket were removed from the chamber and quickly placed in testing position. This placement required less than 90 seconds. The blanket was removed and the impact was recorded. During impact testing, the temperature was recorded and the surface temperature at impact was recorded as the test temperature. DAMPING MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION To characterize the material properties of the rib damping material, the NSF Center for Advanced Polymer and Composite Engineering was contacted. This center has the appropriate equipment to characterize exotic materials. Specifically, their test center houses the Rheometrics Solids Analyzer II, or RSA II. The RSA II has the ability to measure several dynamic moduli including Dynamic Young's Modulus, Loss Factor, Dynamic Viscosity, and Dynamic Compliance from a single specimen. A computer controlled insulated box around the specimen allows for a constant temperature setting between -100°C and 300°C. Excitation vibrations can be generated as low as 0.0001 Hz to 100,000 Hz. Overall, the RSA II covers a wide range of measurement extremes. To characterize the damping material utilizing the RSA II a section was cut 0.1 18 inches thick x 0.25 inches wide x 1 .0 inches long. The specimen was then placed in the RSA II machine using the dual cantilever configuration. An initial strain was placed on the specimen to ensure no loss in contact between the test piece and excitation force. The specimen was then excited over a range of frequencies of 0.016 Hz to 16 Hz. After each frequency sweep, an incremental temperature change of 4.0°F was initiated and the next sweep began. The specimen was tested from 55°F to 83°F. After testing, the RSA II machine internally produced a Master Curve and horizontal shift factor as seen in the next chapter. For a more complete description of this method of viscoelastic material characterization see ref. 29. FINITE ELEMENT MODEL SOFTWARE PACKAGE SELECTION Initially, l-DEAS was used to model the rib, however problems with the non-linear analysis portion of the program necessitated a switch to ANSYS, which proved to be more robust and accurate. The solid model was formed in Pro-Engineer based on General Motors' engineering drawings of the Hybrid III #3 rib. The model was then imported into ANSYS by use of the IGES universal modeling file importer. Due to the symmetry of the rib, only one half of the rib had to be modeled. Next, the metal I damping material interaction needed to be examined. Because experienced users of the Hybrid III thorax have not seen the damping material peel away from the metal ribs with the use of current adhesives, the damping material and metal were modeled as one solid structure with separate material properties; thus allowing no relative motion between the two. A schematic of the solid model can be seen in Figure 5. MATERIAL MODELS The thorax assembly is comprised of four main materials, SAE 1075 steel, P-23653 damping material, Polyurethane in the bib, and the Delrin sternum. The material properties of each material are independent of the direction of loading. Therefore, an isotropic material model was used. 884</page><page sequence="6">Damping Material /[ / I ' - It Polyurethane Bib sternum Element Eleniem U. X Steel Rib ^ Figure 5: Solid Model Schematic To perform a dynamic analysis, four material properties are essential: Young's Modulus, Poisson's Ratio, density, and structural damping coefficient ß. Traditional property tables give the properties for»SAE 1075 steel as well as Polyurethane. The damping material and Delrin sternum require more investigation. The damping material was sufficiently characterized by the RSA II machine. The Dynamic Young's Modulus and structural damping can be read from the master curve. They were entered into the material model based on the temperature or impact frequency. The density was experimentally determined based on weight and calculated volume of a sample of P-23653 Damping Tile. Poisson's ratio was estimated at 0.40, at typical value for viscoelastic polymers. Simulation testing showed less than a 1.0% difference in deflection with a Poisson's Ratio sweep between 0.25 and 0.45, so 0.40 is assumed an acceptable estimate. In modeling the sternum piece, all Delrin properties were ignored. The purpose in the sternum piece is application of proper boundary conditions. The properties of any specific materials are irrelevant. In order to maintain a rigid body to apply the impact force, the sternum was give a large Young's Modulus, 100 times that of steel. Damping was ignored in the sternum piece and Poisson's ratio was assumed 0.3. The density was calculated based on the sternum mass. This density value is extremely important because inertial effects are vital in dynamic testing; it would be unwise to leave out any inertial masses from the model. The 1.026 lb sternum is considered a relevant mass, especially when it outweighs the rib by 0.146 lbs. The density of the sternum piece accommodates this mass. A list of material properties can be seen in Table 1. Table 1 : Simulation Material Properties Young's Poisson's Mass Beta Modulus Ratio Density Damping Ma,erial E v p ß (Ibf/ii?)

E and ß obtained via master curve (not listed). MESHING The first step in meshing is to choose a meshing technique. With such an awkwardly deforming structure, it was decided that a good control of the mesh had to be contained. For this reason it was decided to use the mapped meshing technique. This gave a decent amount of control at the same time allowing a computer generated mesh. Another benefit to mapped meshing is the ability to use rectangular or brick elements. Triangle and tetrahedrals associated with free meshing are often poorly formed when dealing with thin beam structures. Brick and rectangular elements better model such structures. By selecting mapped meshing in a three dimensional solid model, the user is limited to two types of elements, a 8-noded brick, or 16-noded brick. A 16-noded brick contains an additional node along each edge to enhance element solutions. They are most often used when scrutinizing stress and strain within a structure. Since this project is only interested in displacement and other nodal solutions, the 8-noded brick was chosen. A schematic of the 8-noded brick, SOLID45, can be seen in Figure 6. SOLID45 is valid for plasticity, creep, swelling, stress stiffening, large deflection, and large strain. It can be defined using an isotropic material model and can be used in static and dynamic solutions. In order to develop a suitable mesh density, the model was continuously redefined and solved. A plot of maximum deflection and maximum stress from a linear static solution versus number of elements is shown in Figure . In this project the main concern was the sternal deflection and hysteresis of the model, both functions of deflection. Internal stresses were of secondary importance. Thus, the mesh was optimized to the nodal solutions (deflection) and not the element solutions (stress). Figure 7 shows that the deflection solution is within 5% of the converged value with a 200 element density or greater. This will be considered the optimal density. Figure 8 shows the final mesh density for the model. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS Of all the procedures used to prepare the model, the establishment of boundary conditions is the most critical. Boundary conditions define the interaction relationships between the model and its surroundings. The first important interaction to note when examining the rib Figure 6: SOLID45 - 8-Noded Brick Element 885</page><page sequence="7">Figure 7: Mesh Density Convergence of Key Parameters assembly is its attachment to the spine box. This attachment is performed by inserting two hex screws through the rib and fastening them to the spine box. The screws prevent any movement on behalf of the rib between them. However, outside the screws, the rib is able to pull away from the spine box. In order to simulate this interaction in the finite model, a zero displacement tolerance zone was established along the inner portion of the rib. The zero tolerance permits no movement in the x, y, or z direction. This zone extends from the symmetry line of the rib until the bolt location, Figure 9. The rib assembly also has an interaction at the sternum piece due to the symmetry of the rib design. Since the sternum piece was cut in two when modeling the rib, it is necessary to simulate the missing half. This is done by imposing a zero displacement condition in the y-direction along the cut section, Figure 10. This prevents the sternum piece from overlapping into the other half of the rib and sternum assembly. Upon examination of the high speed film during impact, the sternum piece did not rotate about the z-axis. The sternum piece defects perfectly along the x-axis. To model this effect, a zero rotation around the z-axis condition was placed on the entire sternum piece. The final boundary condition applied is the force from the impactor. During impact, a vast majority of the impactor face stays in contact with the sternum assembly. There is no force transferred between the impactor and rib directly. Therefore, the proper procedure to model the impact force was by applying a load solely to the sternum piece. This force remains parallel to the x- direction throughout the impact. The impactor itself applies a pressure to the sternum piece. However, in finite element models, is it only possible to apply forces to nodes, not surfaces. To simulate a constant pressure, the force was applied equally to the four corner nodes of the sternum piece, Figure 1 1 . The force on each node is 1/4 the total force imposed on the half rib - 1/8 the total force imposed on the entire rib. Figure 8: Final Meshed Model LINEAR VS. NON-LINEAR MODEL Because no plastic deformation of the ribs was evident in physical testing, it will be ignored. All strain is assumed elastic. However, by examination alone, it is easy to see that a relatively large displacement occurs with little strain in the rib assembly. This deformation of the rib assembly institutes a change in the rib's overall stiffness. The rib becomes softer the more it deflects, a common phenomenon of thin beams. Both large deflection and stress stiffening (softening in this case) result in a non- linear solution. To check the non-linearity assumption, multiple static analyses were performed at various loads steps. If the rib is truly a linear system, both lines will overlap and non- linearity is not a valid assumption. If the lines deviate, the system is non-linear. Figure 12 proves that non-linearity is a valid assumption for this model. NON-LINEAR SOLVER OPTIONS To perform the non-linear analysis, Each load step was broken down into ten substeps. This appeared to be the minimal amount of sub-steps for the solution to converge. At large deflections, less than ten substeps did allow the solution to converge. To assist the software, auto sub-stepping was also activated. This allowed the computer to add more sub-steps if deemed necessary based on a complex computer algorithm. The maximum number of sub-steps was set at 40 for automatic stepping. To assist in converging at each sub-step, the solution prediction and line search options were activated. This allowed the computer to anticipate the answer thereby preventing divergence. In some cases, it increased the convergence rate. 886</page><page sequence="8">Figure 9: Spine Box Boundary Condition *' FigurelO: Sternum Boundary Condition A majority of the mathematical solving techniques were left at their default option due to lack of knowledge by the author. Only one option was altered from their default status. The lump mass option was also activated which reduces the mass matrix into a smaller form. This assisted in convergence rate and appeared to have little or no effect on the final solution. All other non-linearity options and solver techniques were left at default status. DYNAMIC ANALYSIS Dynamic analysis is basically identical to the static analysis with the exception of a time varying load. In order to perform a dynamic analysis, only two changes from the static model had to be made. The first alteration was the material properties of the damping material. The Young's Modulus and ß damping change with respect to both temperature and excitation frequency. The excitation frequency was calculated from the time duration of impact. The sternal deflection was modeled as Î4 of a sinusoidal wave. Multiplying the time duration of deflection by two and inverting gives the excitation frequency, as seen in the Equation: J f excitation = ní- i ' J excitation ní- ... ' 2 [impact ... time ) Figure 1 1 : Applied Load Boundary Condition Figure 12: Linear Vs Non-Linear Static Test 72.5T With the elimination of the spike, the force trace can be simulated using a parabolic model. The time duration of the force model was based upon the event time as defined by contact between the impactor face and sternum. The amplitude of the parabolic model was based on the maximum force depicted using the 40 Hz filter. Although this filter causes an elongation in the data, the relative amplitude is not affected in any way. Reading the maximum force from the 40 Hz filter is a better estimate than deciphering the 300 Hz filter. The model was then broken down into 10 evenly spaced load steps allowing for linear interpolation between the load steps. Figure 13 shows the modeled force versus an experimentally recorded force. After extensive testing, this profile proved to provide the best simulation result. Figure 1 3 : Parabolic Force Model 887</page><page sequence="9">RESULTS PHYSICAL STATIC TESTING Single rib static testing serves only to verify the finite element model. No dynamic properties or trends can be interpreted from the results. Both the metal rib and damped rib tests were performed at an ambient temperature of 72.5°F. The results of both tests are shown in Figure 14. Three observations can be ihade of the static results. First, both the metal rib and damped rib behave non- linearly. Static force does not vary proportionately with deflection. This gives physical confirmation to the non- linearity assumption made while generating the finite element model. Second, there appears to be a significant amount of hysteresis in both static tests. Any hysteresis effects seen in the damped rib would normally be attributed to the damping material. However, a significant amount of hysteresis is also exhibited in the metal rib. Physical examination of the specimens during testing showed no plastic deformation of the metal or damped rib sets. Both rib sets, notably the metal set, returned to original shape at end of testing. Classic materials theory also states that steel does not normally exhibit hysteretic characteristics; it is essentially an elastic solid. Therefore, this hysteresis can only be attributed to the Polyurethane in the bib. Under heavy loads for long duration, the bib plastically deformed and exhibited a creep effect. This hysteresis effect is not a phenomenon of the rib assembly. Therefore, the unloading portion of the static curve was ignored during simulation verification. It is important to note that although the testing was performed at very slow speeds, 0.25 inches per minute, the test is still dynamic with a very low excitation frequency of 0.1 Hz. This is a useful observation when determining the properties of the damping material under Figure 1 4 Physical Static Testing - Force Vs Deflection semi-static conditions. PHYSICAL DYNAMIC TESTING From each dynamic test, five important parameters can be interpreted. The first three, sternal deflection, pendulum speed, and max force during impact, relate to the severity of the impact. The fourth, hysteresis, reveals the biofidelity of the rib during impact. The last parameter, impact time, is important for later modeling of the impact force. Sinale Metal Rib- Interpreting the results of the metal rib impact gives no significant insight to the design sensitivity of the Hybrid III thorax. Instead, like the static tests, it is used to assist in the finite element modeling process. The results obtained during metal rib testing were not as useful or as clear as originally anticipated. Multiple unforeseen factors greatly degraded the data collection process. The lower overall stiffness of the metal rib without damping material necessitated much slower impact speeds than desired. Measurements from the accelerometer were often full of vibratory response thereby corrupting the force / deflection curves, especially at the lower speeds. The addition of the sternum piece resulted in unexpected inertial effects. Testing was performed using a trial and error method. The strange inertial and stiffness effects made it nearly impossible to develop deflection predictions. Instead, the pendulum set height was adjusted until the desired deflection range was tested. The results of the test are shown in Table 2. Figure 15 shows a plot of the maximum force during impact versus maximum sternal displacement. A typical force / deflection curve of a metal rib impact is shown in Figure 16. Before examining the results, it is important to note the difficulty encountered in reducing the data collected. During the slower impacts, 0.74 to 4.00 fl/sec, the accelerometer data was overcome by the vibratory noise in the signal. This resulted in a poor maximum force reading and hysteresis measurement. Conversely, the faster pendulum speeds, 4.00 "/sec and up, the force Table 2: Dynamic Metal Rib Testing Results - ^ R'b Pendulum .. r- R&gt;b ... . . _. - Test # ^ _ o j Max .. r- Force _ ~ ...

Thus, the faster speeds resulted in more reasonable data. All observations are based on results obtained from the faster speeds. Two interesting observations can be drawn from this data. First, there is an extensive amount of hysteresis occurring in the force / deflection curve during impact. This trend can be seen in the larger sternal deflection tests (#31 - #36). Since metal is nearly a perfectly elastic solid, this hysteresis cannot be derived from viscous losses in the rib. Instead, the hysteresis is a result of the bib and sternum piece. With the slower metal rib impact speeds, the small viscous energy losses in the bib become more pronounced. However, these losses still remain only a small percentage of the total hysteresis. A majority of the hysteretic loss was due to inertial effects of the 1 .026 pound sternum. Being placed at the end of the rib assembly, the sternum experiences the maximum acceleration of the rib during impact, thereby having the greatest inertial effect possible. It can be shown through time differentiation of the sternal displacement and fundamental kinetics that 64% of the metal rib hysteresis is a result of the sternum's inertial effects. The second observation is the relationship between maximum impact force and maximum sternal deflection. Although the metal rib exhibits a non-linear response, the relationship between these two parameters was nearly linear over the deflection range tested. Single Damped Rib- Dynamic testing of the damped rib was accomplished without incident. No unforeseen problems arose that caused any great concern. All tests were performed with an ambient laboratory temperature of 70°F. The pendulum was released from calculated set heights to achieve a wide range of deflections, as predicted from preliminary testing. The results from the testing can be seen Table 3 and Figure 17. Figure 18 shows a typical force / deflection curve of a damped rib impact. Figure 16: Metal Rib Force / Deflection CurveTest # 33 Again, two observations can be made from this testing. First, hysteresis appears to increase in the force / deflection curve as the deflection increases. Although it is only a slight increase, 4.4 percentage points over 1 .75 inches, the trend remains constant throughout the testing. It is important to note that a vast majority of this hysteresis is a result of viscous losses in the damping material as opposed to bib and sternum losses in the metal rib. Sternum inertial effects only account for 7% of the hysteresis in the damped rib. The second observation is that the relationship between maximum impact force and maximum sternal displacement is slightly non-linear with the addition of the damping material as opposed to the linearity of the metal rib. Temperature Sensitivity Testing- The hopes of the temperature sensitivity testing was not only to provide verification for the finite element model, but also to classify the degree of sensitivity. It was expected that temperature variations of +/- 10 °F drastically affect the response of the Hybrid III thorax. The sensitivity testing, like the damped rib testing, was performed as planned. The only concern that arose was keeping the rib at a constant temperature after being removed from its chamber. In order to minimize interaction between the rib and ambient air, the blanket was allowed to remain covering the rib and test stand until immediately before impact. However, even with this precaution, the surface temperature often changed by one or two degrees in a 90 second period after removal from the chamber. This effect was most noticeable at the cooler rib core temperatures. To accurately obtain a test temperature, the thermocouples were allowed to continue recording during the impact testing. These recordings were later analyzed for exact rib temperature at impact. To maintain consistency, each test was performed at the same impact speed, 8.8 ft/sec.

Table 4 shows the numerical results of the impacts. Figure 19 shows the alteration of the force / deflection curve at select temperatures. Figure 20 and Figure 21 show the result of temperature on maximum sternal deflection and hysteresis. Upon examination of this data, there was definitely a noticeable relationship between rib response and temperature. Under identical impacts, the deflection differed by more than 22% over a temperature range of just 15 °F. Likewise, the hysteresis differed more than 11% over the same temperature range. It is also interesting to note the linearity in both Figure 20 and Figure 21. Both hysteresis and sternal deflection are proportional to rib core temperature. DAMPING MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION As discussed earlier, the Rheometrics Solids Analyzer II was used to characterize the damping material. Upon completion of the test matrix, the RS A II processed the data and calculated a master curve with a corresponding horizontal shift factor as depicted in Figure 22 and Figure 23. Both are combined and a reduced frequency nanogram is shown in Figure 24. From these curves a plot of damping material properties versus temperature is possible, Figure 25. Explanation on the use of these plots can be found in Ref. 29. A majority of thorax impact testing occurs at excitation frequencies of 2 to 10 Hz. Examination of the master curve shows that these impacts occur when the phase Figure 1 8 Damped Rib Force / Deflection Curve - Test # 19 angle is greatest. Recall, phase angle is a good determination of the amount of viscous dampening present in a material. Therefore, the material is well suited to take full advantage if its damping characteristics at the typical impact frequencies. However, either a large increase or reduction in impact speed will decrease the damping effect of the rib material. Figure 25 shows the relationship between Young's Modulus, phase angle, and temperature at a 5 Hertz excitation frequency. The phase angle remains fairly constant over a temperature range of 60 to 75 °F with slight drops on either side. The Young's Modulus, on the other hand, drops nearly an entire order of magnitude between 55 and 85 °F. Rib response is in essence a culmination of these two properties. Although the phase angle remains constant over a small temperature window, the drastically changing Young's Modulus alters the performance of the rib throughout the entire temperature range. FINITE ELEMENT RESULTS Static Simulation- The purpose of static testing was to ensure both proper material characterization and boundary conditions. Static testing verifies the stiffness of the model as defined by the Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio. The Young's Modulus of the damping material was calculated from the master curve and horizontal shift factor utilizing a 0.1 Hz excitation frequency and a temperature of 72.5 °F. Results of the static tests are compared to the physical tests in Figure 26. The discrepancy between the metal rib simulation and physical testing was roughly 10%. Considering the difficulty encountered modeling the stiffness of the metal rib, this was acceptable. The damped rib, however, showed very good agreement between the simulation and physical test. Upon examination of this data, the boundary conditions and material stiffnesses were verified to be accurate. 890</page><page sequence="12">Table 4: Temperature Sensitivity Testing ResultsPhysical Testing T-rt 'est m # Rib m_v Max Force Vr Rib Deflection „ „ Hysteresis , _ _.

Dynamic analysis, with the addition of sternum inertia! effects, would only further worsen the issue. Additionally, difficulties encountered during dynamic physical testing of the metal rib gave distrust in the results obtained. With little confidence in either the physical or simulation testing, verification of the dynamic metal rib was nearly impossible. Any discrepancy between the two would be unexplainable. Neither data set was considered worthy of confidence. The comparison of the two is only presented here out of completeness of the simulation process and no conclusions are drawn. Table 5 gives the numerical results of the simulation. Figure 27 shows the relationship between maximum sternal deflection and maximum impact force. Finally, a typical simulation response and physical response is shown in Figure 28. Dynamic Damped Rib Simulation- Better results were seen in the case of the damped rib.

The only conditions that were altered were material density and beta damping coefficient. Both parameters were varied slightly to judge the effects. After doing several parametric studies, it was determined that the original, calculated material properties provided the best fit, Figure 29. Numerical results are shown in Table 6. Figure 30 shows a comparison of the force I deflection curves for a moderate hit of 2.00 inches of deflection. Examination of the simulation response shows that the deflection behavior appears to accurately model the physical data. Figure 29 shows a maximum of 12.3% discrepancy between the physical and simulation data. Contrarily, comparison of the hysteresis measurement did not show a correlation between physical and simulation data. Physical testing showed that the more severe hits, with increased deflections, showed a rise in hysteresis. Overall, hysteresis increased 4.4 percentage points over 1.75 inches of deflection. Simulation data also reveals a relationship between hysteresis and deflection; however, the trend is reversed.

The discrepancy in hysteresis is likely a result of the simulation. Parametric testing of the model showed a strong correlation between hysteresis and inertial effects. Recall that inertial effects are a product of acceleration and mass density. If either of these two aspects varied, there was a consequential deviation in hysteresis. During formulation of the finite element model, the force profile, which controls acceleration effects, was optimized towards proper sternal deflection response. At the time, little concern was placed on proper modeling of the accelerations associated with the profile. Figure 31 and Figure 32 plot the impact force and deflection versus time for physical and simulation tests. Examination of the impact forces shows that the physical model has a steeper onset of force than the simulation. Conversely, the simulation has a steeper drop off in force during the unloading portion of the curve than the physical test. This discrepancy has greatly affected the deflection profiles of each. During loading, the physical rib accelerates rapidly to maximum deflection. Whereas, the simulation takes much more time to accelerate the sternum piece to maximum deflection. During unloading, the gradual slope of the physical impact force allows for Figure 32 a smoother unloading of the deflection curve. With the steeper unloading of the simulation force, the deflection snaps back to the equilibrium point much quicker. These differences result in a deviation between force / deflection curves. Consequentially, the hysteresis calculation will not be equivalent between the two. 893</page><page sequence="15">Table 7: Temperature Sensitivity Simulation Results Test # R,b Max Force Excitation Dampening Material Temperature Frequency Young's Mod Beta (T) ObO (Hz) (Ibf/in) S-26 63.5 115.0 7.69 56457 0.0145 S-28 71.5 103.0 6.67 33405 0.0168 S-27 78.0 97.0 6.25 22428 0.0169 _ Test# . u Rib Deflection „ Hysteresis , _. _ Test# . u _ _ . „ Hysteresis / Impact , _.

With the lesser impacts, the accelerations are not as large and the force / deflection curves match each other more closely. Lowering the mass density of the sternum piece has showed that the accelerations play a lesser effect in the force / deflection curve. If the sternum piece could be eliminated from both the simulation and physical test, these accelerations would not play as critical a role. Temperature Sensitivity Simulation- To perform a temperature sensitivity study using the finite element model, only two parameters needed to be altered, the impact load and damping material properties. The impact load was modeled after its representative physical test. The Young's Modulus and beta dampening coefficient were modeled from the master curve dependent on temperature and excitation frequency. The results of the simulation are shown in Table 7. Figure 33 shows simulation force / deflection curves at select temperatures. Figure 34 and Figure 35 show the sternal deflection and hysteresis versus rib core temperature. The temperature sensitivity simulation achieved consistent results. All the trends that appeared in the physical testing also appeared in the simulation testing. The sternal deflection increases with increasing temperature; 0.65 inches over the temperature range Figure 35 : Force / Deflection Hysteresis Vs Temperature tested. Although this is more severe than 0.49 inches the physical testing shows, the temperature / deflection correlation remains consistent. Both physical and simulation testing show a decrease in hysteresis of roughly 7 to 8 percentage points over the temperature range tested. The bias in the data can be contributed to sternal inertial effects. Overall, the simulation reinforces the observations made during physical testing. Temperature swings of +/- 7° to 10° F dramatically affect the response of the Hybrid III thorax. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS CONCLUSIONS 1. Pendulum accelerometer measurements are corrupted by vibratory effects encountered from the metal to hard plastic impact during dynamic testing. 2. The inertial weight of the sternum accounted for hysteretic effects in metal rib dynamic testing. Whereas the metal rib should exhibit little or not hysteresis, an average of 22% hysteresis was recorded during most metal rib impacts. 894</page><page sequence="16">3. Damped dynamic testing exhibited an increase in hysteresis with increasing severity of impact. This is likely due to the inertial effects of the sternum. Hysteresis should remain fairly well constant across the entire testing range. 4. Sternum piece inertial effects account for 64% of the hysteresis in the metal rib and 7% of the hysteresis if the damped rib. These effects are not phenomena of the rib assemblies and cause difficulty in accurate hysteresis measurement from the force / deflection curve. 5. Comparison of the physical and simulation static tests show strong correlation. From this observation, it can be shown that the stiffness matrix and boundary conditions of the finite element model accurately represent the physical model. 6. Comparison of the physical and simulation dampened dynamic testing showed correlation in trends between max force and displacement. An increase in impact force leads to an increase in displacement. 7. Comparison of the physical and simulation dampened dynamic testing showed poor correlation in hysteresis trends. This discrepancy can be contributed to the simulation results. Inadequate modeling of the force accelerations lead to decreased hysteresis measurements for the more severe impacts. 8. From characterization of the damping material, it can be shown that the rib is taking optimal effect of the beta damping coefficient (phase angle) while being tested in the 2 to 10 Hertz range. Impacts outside of this range will experience loss in damping effects. 9. Characterization of the dampening material shows a strong dependency on temperature. Although the phase angle stays fairly constant across the temperature range tested, the Young's Modulus drops nearly an order of magnitude. This drastic decrease greatly affects the overall stiffness of the rib and is the leading cause in the thorax temperature dependence. 10. Both simulation and physical testing showed a strong correlation between rib response and rib core temperature. Physical testing exhibited a deflection variation of 0.49 inches over a temperature range from 63° to 78° F. Simulation exhibited a deflection variation of 0.65 inches over the same range. Hysteresis dropped 7 to 8 percentage points over the temperature range tested for both. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Sternum inertial effects are a reoccurring issue for both the physical and simulation testing. The large weight causes adverse inertial effects in both situations. Elimination of this piece is recommended in any future testing. However, a new, non-intrusive, method for measuring displacement would have to be developed. 2. Low frequency filtering of the accelerometer data was not a desirable solution to the pendulum vibration noise. It is recommended that a new technique be developed to record accelerations. Preferably a rib based measurement device incorporated into the test rig. 3. All simulations performed required physical data to model the force profile. No simulation could be performed without an existing comparable physical test. This gives very little freedom in examining redesigns with the model. To eliminate this dependency, the impactor needs to be modeled and its impact velocity input as a boundary condition. This would eliminate the need to input a force profile. However, full body dynamics are limited to only the high end finite element software packages. ANSYS does not have this ability, yet. 4. Non-linear dynamics is one of the more difficult solution methods in finite element modeling. Software designers are continuously updating the solvers to produce more accurate and reliable results. During the closing weeks of this thesis, ANSYS was updated from Version 5.3 to 5.4. This update noticeably affected the results of the simulation model. To take advantage of these improvements, the model should be updated with each major advancement in finite element software. To examine the cause of the temperature dependence, physical testing was performed on individual Hybrid III ribs, the damping material was characterized, and a finite element model was formulated. Both the physical and simulation testing show a 20% to 30% variation in sternal deflection over a temperature range of 63° to 78° Fahrenheit. Close examination of the damping material characterization shows that the Young's Modulus drops nearly an entire order of magnitude across the 15° temperature range. This variation greatly affects the overall stiffness of the rib during impact and is the leading cause of the thorax temperature dependence.
