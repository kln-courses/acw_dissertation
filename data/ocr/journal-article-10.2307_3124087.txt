In his famous essay whose centennial we here celebrate, "The Signifi- cance of the Frontier in American History," religion is definitely of secondary importance to people on the frontier. He says only that the settled East, worried about the perceived social fluidity of the West, saw the region as a fertile mission field, and that in the comparative institutional void of the West religious sects flourished.2 Turner asso- ciated churches with the very kinds of organized movements and agencies imported from the Old World and established in the East that most deteriorated and melted away on the frontier. Historic churches became competing sects. Theology was replaced with emo- tion. The matrix of the frontier, in his vague language, favored indi- vidualism and practical action, values he did not find characteristic of organized religion. While the frontier affected religion, religion had little affect on the frontier. Turner's importance, of course, lies more in how his interpreta- tion influenced the work of other scholars than in his own publica- tions; and the frontier became for almost four decades the dominant interpretative motif in the history of American Christianity. The first full-scale application of Turnerian ideas to religion in the United States appeared in a book written by a professor of church history at the University of Chicago Divinity School, Peter G. Mode. In his 1923 book, The Frontier Spirit in American Christianity, Mode declared "that the Americanizing of Christianity has been the process by which it has been frontierized."3 He then went on to ascribe to the influence of the frontier what he considered the defining characteris- tics of American religion: the missionary urge, the dominance of re- vivalism, the proliferation of denominational colleges and competing sects, evangelical cooperation at one moment and rivalry the next, centralized church government, the relative weakness of sacerdotal- ism and the emphasis on the individual conversion experience. For Mode the frontier's influence was passive; religious ideas, institu- tions, and practices changed themselves to fit the practical needs of the people of the West.

The historian who most popularized the interpretation that the frontier was the critical locale for the development of American relig- ion was William Warren Sweet, who also taught for decades at the University of Chicago, although Mode left before Sweet joined the faculty.4 Sweet edited a number of volumes of documents, and he wrote a series of books on Methodism, on revivalism in American history, and a widely used textbook, The Story of Religion in America, which went through a number of editions. For Sweet the quintessen- tial American locale was the frontier-never adequately defined, how- ever-and it was that environment that he believed should most concern the historian interested in American religion. In good Tur- nerian language Sweet wrote in his textbook that the "greatest ac- complishment of America" was the conquering of the continent; throughout this two-century process "the churches were in continu- ous contact with frontier conditions and needs, and no single fact is more significant in its influence upon American religion. "5 Like Mode, Sweet emphasized how religion adapted to the frontier situa- tion, producing a peculiar American form of Christianity; unlike Mode, however, Sweet went on to suggest how religion in turn influ- enced the frontier. Turner's frontier determinism gave immense transformative pow- ers to a rather vague concept, the frontier. In Turner's writings the frontier changed the institutions that were brought to it from the East and gave rise to vigorous new adaptations. Turner focused, however, less on what was brought to the frontier than on the way the frontier broke down old ways and produced new institutions, practices, and ideas. This basic Turnerian idea Sweet implicitly rejected.6 He ea- gerly accepted the argument that the frontier was the region of the most interesting and important developments in the evolution of American religion, but for Sweet the emphasis lay on how religious leaders creatively adapted their approach (institutions, policies, theol- ogy) to fit the particular social environment of the frontier.

The population on the frontier was scattered, so the Methodist practice of using itinerant rather than set- tled preachers enabled them to minister most efficiently and effec- tively to the people on the frontier. There were relatively few affluent persons on the frontier at first, and educational institutions were slow to develop, so Methodists and Baptists-who did not require their ministers to have formal educations and read the ancient languages- were best able to supply the needs of the region. Unpaid Baptist farmer-ministers, completely without pretensions, perfectly suited the frontier. Both Baptists and Methodists were extremely energetic in their evangelistic efforts, and this tradition of ministerial activism has been a hallmark of American religion, especially since the disestablishment of the colonial state churches. Revival techniques such as the camp meeting, that deemphasized theology and made skilled use of emo- tion, appealed to settlers who lacked book learning, hungered for fel- lowship, and had none of the habits of restraint associated with the established societies on the eastern seaboard. Sweet saw the Method- ists (and to a lesser degree the Baptists) as best equipped to meet the demands of the frontier, and as a result he saw them as the most representative Protestant denomination in America. Thus for Sweet, the frontier-again understood as a region, not a process-stood as the proving ground for American Christianity, a conclusion that has proved very durable and influential. Sweet also described the role of the churches on the frontier, em- phasizing how vigorous evangelical Protestantism influenced the peo- ple on the frontier. The argument that religious institutions, leaders, and ideas could themselves have a causative role was not Turnerian. For Sweet the churches were civilizing agents. On the rough and ready frontier with its individualizing tendencies and its atomized so- ciety, the church established local pockets of community life. Church disciplinary proceedings tamed the immorality and social disorder of the frontier by holding church members to a Biblical code of behav- ior.7 Churches and their ministers often provided the first rudiments of an educational system on the frontier, and they provided a primi- 7 Sweet, "The Churches as Moral Courts of the Frontier," Church History, 2 (Mar. 1933), 3-21. 208</page><page sequence="5">A SYMPOSIUM ON FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER tive social safety net for those who were ill, orphaned, widowed, and otherwise disadvantaged. In helping to tame the frontier the churches proved their worth, Sweet concluded, and the character of the result- ing nation bore testimony to their essential role. This basic Mode-Sweet interpretation that the churches that best adapted to the frontier were destined to be most influential in Amer- ica, and that the successful adaptations largely characterized subse- quent church development, dominated American religious historiography so completely for almost a half century that the argu- ments often were taken for granted, with no supporting documenta- tion deemed necessary. Such automatic application of an explanatory scheme, in effect an off-the-shelf all-purpose interpretation, proved detrimental to fresh analysis. Whether it was the supposed nature of frontier life, or the emotional character of the religion that flourished there, the idea of a kind of peculiarly American "frontier religion" became a staple of religious history. Hence Leonard J. Trinterud in The Forming of an American Tradition. A Reexamination of Colonial Presbyte- rianism could write about "old traditions" being "sloughed off at the frontier" and "the creation of new forms and new orders adequate for preaching the Gospel in the frontier situation."8 The landmark documentary history, American Christianity. An Historical Interpretation with Representative Documents, edited by H. Shelton Smith, Robert T. Handy, and Lefferts A. Loetscher, likewise asserted that "the revival- ism of the frontier especially made an impress on American religion that was to have far-reaching significance. "9 Cultural historian Ralph H. Gabriel came close to summing up this frontier-religion hypothesis in 1950. "The folk religion of the ex- uberant, optimistic, and undisciplined frontier," he wrote, "repre- sented a bizarre, but nonetheless genuine, expression to the spirit of romanticism. This religion had power. It helped to subdue the grosser evils of the frontier. It made an impress on American society that persisted far into the twentieth century."10 Perhaps the last general history of American religion so to emphasize the frontier and the style 8 Trinterud, The Forming of an American Tradition: A Reappraisal of Colonial Presbyteri- anism (Philadelphia 1949), 36-37. 9 H.

Handy's History of the Churches in the United States and Canada. Introducing his discussion of the Great Revival that began in Kentucky at the end of the eighteenth century, Handy set a familiar stage: "The social setting of frontier revivalism was quite different from that of the East, however, for life on the frontier was often hard, lonely, and dangerous. The civilizing amenities of the older sections were usually at a minimum .... In such settings, revivals sometimes reached peaks of undisciplined emo- tion."'l Sweet would not have said it any differently. The historiography of revivalism-and especially the Great Ken- tucky Revival-charts the rise and fall of this frontier hypothesis. The so-called Kentucky Revival, more than any other event in American religious history, seemed to incarnate "frontier revivalism" pure and simple. Catherine C. Cleveland's writing, The Great Revival in the West, 1797-1805, interpreted the revival's origins in exactly the Tur- nerian terms both Mode and Sweet used several years later in their more general works.12 It all seems predictable now: the frontier set- ting, the loneliness, the absence of good morals, the energetic efforts of various ministers, the emotionalism, the emergence of the camp meeting as a peculiarly effective adaptation to frontier needs. This focus on the frontier as a necessary ingredient for the revival's origin, for the raw emotionalism of the preaching, and especially for the de- velopment of the camp meeting as a quintessentially American relig- ious institution, continued for four decades as a motif in such works as Charles A. Johnson's The Frontier Camp Meeting. Religion's Harvest Time13 and Bernard Weisberger's They Gathered at the River. The Story of the Great Revivalists and Their Impact on Religion in America.14 Weisber- ger's book at times verges on unconscious caricature of the frontier interpretation. By the mid-1950s, however, religious historians al- ready were beginning to critique the use of the frontier locale as an interpretative panacea.

Revival measures were as proper in Boston as in Kentucky."16 In the 1965 textbook Religion in America, which immediately became a standard, Winthrop S. Hudson developed a sustained critique of the casual application of the frontier thesis to American religion and revival- ism. Speaking of the eighteenth-century Great Awakening, Hudson wrote: Nor is the suggestion that the revivals were the product of the unset- tled condition of frontier life an adequate explanation of a phenome- non that was equally widespread in both Britain and America. Furthermore, the communities along the Connecticut River and be- tween New York and Philadelphia, where the revivals first appeared, were centers of an established agrarian economy rather than frontier settlements. Even after revivalism became an accepted feature of American religious life, revivals seldom occurred in an area until the frontier period was over; and they manifested themselves with equal fervor in many of the oldest communities.17 In similar fashion Hudson pointed out that during the revivals that be- gan in the West about 1800, conditions were almost identical in much of Virginia and North Carolina. The frontier per se played little role in religious developments.18 Sydney E. Ahlstrom reiterated this opinion bluntly in his influential book, A Religious History of the American People: "The creativeness of the frontier, or rather, the power of the frontier to alter or refashion whatever came into it, must be minimized."19 Cer- tainly this devaluing of the frontier has been reflected over the last two decades in a series of important studies of urban revivalism, ranging from Paul E. Johnson's A Shopkeeper's Millennium. Society and Revivals in Rochester, New York, 1815-1837 with its heavy-handed social control the- sis to Terry D. Bilhartz's Urban Religion and the Second Great Awakening: Church and Society in Early National Baltimore.20 Historians no longer auto- matically associate revivals, even in the early nineteenth century, with the western frontier. 16 Smith, Revivalism and Social Reform: American Protestantism on the Eve of the Civil War (1957; rev. ed., New York 1965), 9. 17 Hudson, Religion in America (New York 1965), 60-61. 18 Ibid., 133. 19 Ahlstrom, A Religious History of the American People (New Haven 1972), 453. 20 Johnson, A Shopkeeper's Millennium: Society and Revivals in Rochester, New York, 1815-1836 (New York 1978); Bilhartz, Urban Religion and the Second Great Awakening in Early Nartional Baltimore (Rutherford, N. J. 1986). 212</page><page sequence="9">A SYMPOSIUM ON FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER This questioning of the significance of the frontier on the develop- ment of American religion was central to my own study of what was at the time called the western or Kentucky revivals. Entitling my book The Great Revival, 1787-1805: The Origins of the Southern Evangelical Mind, I attempted to shift the discussion of revival origins away from emphasis on raw frontier conditions and toward a consideration of the theological- intellectual world of the clergy and church members. (At the time I did not know the word mentalite; if I had, I would have used it to describe what I was trying to explicate.21) Consequently my interpretation began with the churches along the seaboard South, showing, for example, that the Methodists' use of itinerant ministers preaching across a broad cir- cuit, and the Baptists' use of unpaid farmer-preachers, had always been characteristics of those two denominations and were not frontier adapta- tions. I discussed southern ministerial attitudes toward a perceived de- clension of religion, not just on the frontier but across the entire South from Virginia to Kentucky, and I contextualized this concern in the clergy's attitudes about God's role in history and the role of prayer. I discovered that the preconditions for a revival-a widely accepted belief system, a network of churches and ministers, a perception of social cri- sis that seems susceptible only to a providential solution-existed throughout the South. That the revival first erupted in Kentucky was more fortuitous than necessary or predictable, and given the similarity of conditions there to those elsewhere in the region, the revival quickly spread eastward from Kentucky eventually to envelop the entire South. Nevertheless, the revivals that began in Kentucky were interpreted by contemporaries as something new because of their size, the emo- tional nature of some of the conversions, and the interdenominational involvement. And while I mentioned that emotional, large-scale, even outdoor religious services were not unknown in the older states (Meth- odist love feasts and quarterly meetings, Baptist association meetings, even Wesley preaching to huge outdoor crowds in England), I still de- scribed the camp meeting as a religious adaptation to frontier needs, though I did describe how it spread back across the entire South and soon became a peculiarly Methodist institution. The frontier thesis was far from dead. Two years after my study Dickson D. Bruce, Jr., in And They All Sang Hallelujah. Plain-Folk Camp-Meeting Religion, 1800-1845, provided a structural analysis of the camp meetings that fit neatly into the traditional frontier analysis. 21 John B. Boles, The Great Revival, 1787-1805. The Origins of the Southern Evangelical Mind (Lexington, Ky. 1972). 22 Bruce, And They All Sang Hallelujah. Plain-Folk Camp-Meeting Religion, 1800-1845 (Knoxville, Tenn. 1974). 213</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF THE EARLY REPUBLIC In a brief book, Religion in Antebellum Kentucky (1976), which to a degree represented a second iteration of my earlier thesis, I described how the camp meeting revival was adapted via the protracted meeting to become a regular feature of urban church life.23 Since that time, sev- eral recent books have considerably refined and extended my efforts to situate the Kentucky revivals in a broader geographical and longer tem- poral context. These studies implicitly dismiss the Turnerian idea that the frontier smashed the intellectual, cultural, and institution baggage brought from Europe or the East ("strips off the garments of civiliza- tion" is Turner's phrase) and created a new set of novel American atti- tudes and practices. If my book suggested an alternative view, Leigh Eric Schmidt's Holy Fairs. Scottish Communions and American Revivals in the Early Modern Period aggressively advances a counter-interpretation of the frontier.24 For Schmidt frontier camp meetings were only a New World replication of an old Presbyterian regional communion service that lasted several days, attracted huge, expectant crowds, and created intense emotions. The foremost and legendary of such eighteenth-century "holy fairs" oc- curred at Cambuslang, Scotland, in 1742, and it is clear that the first so-called camp meetings at Gasper River and Cane Ridge, Kentucky, emerged from similar scheduled Presbyterian communion meetings. In- terestingly though, none of the Presbyterian ministers immediately in- volved at first recognized the genealogical connection between camp meetings and these earlier Scottish Presbyterian practices. Instead, they usually compared them to a modern-day version of Pentecost. Still, I think it fair to say that this Scottish communion institution was one of the ingredients, however unintended, that fed the camp meeting phe- nomenon in Kentucky. Paul K. Conkin's recent interpretation, Cane Ridge: America's Pentecost, despite its title, largely accepts Schmidt's con- clusions about Scottish antecedents.25 Both works emphasize the staying power of religious ideas, habits, and practices across time and distance. Russell E. Richey's recent and sensitive meditation on Early Ameri- can Methodism offers yet another candidate for an institutional precursor of the frontier camp meeting, namely the late-eighteenth-century Meth- odist practice known as the quarterly conference.26 These meetings were 23 John B.

Especially vigorous preaching marked these mass gatherings pro- ducing intense emotional results; a centerpiece of the event was a communion service. An apt phrase often used at the time to describe the results of this experience was "melting time," a reference both to the softening of hearts and the flowing of joyful tears. While there was some Methodist ecclesiastical business completed at such quarterly con- ferences, in every other respect they exhibited the characteristics of the later camp meeting. John Wesley, of course, had also often spoken to huge outdoor crowds in England that reacted emotionally to his ringing sermons. Richey is careful not to claim Methodist ownership of the in- vention of the camp meeting, but he does suggest strong Methodist roots for what, intermingled with both Presbyterian and Baptist prac- tices, helped create an authentically American religious institution. No historian has yet stepped forward to advance the thesis that the Baptist associational meetings in early Virginia and North Carolina served as models for the camp meeting. Here too, emotional preaching to large crowds that often could not fit in a church building typified nonfrontier Baptist practices that seem to foreshadow what later evolved in frontier Kentucky only to spread quickly back across the region and, in fact, throughout much of America. Thus, there seems to be no short- age of eligible precursors to a supposedly unique frontier revival form. The interpretative thrust of these recent studies is to deny that the frontier was either the necessary or the exclusive locale in which revivals could begin, proliferate, and prosper, and to refute the argument that the frontier somehow created novel institutions little related to what had gone before. The result of the new scholarship has been a welcome anal- ysis of urban religion, greater recognition that so-called frontier condi- tions and social needs were not as unique as previously suggested, and a better understanding of just how resilient and flexible religious institu- tions could be in changed or evolving environments. At the same time, the revisionist rush to discover the roots of the camp meeting revival in Scottish communion practices or in Methodist or Baptist activities in the East perhaps conceals too much of how really different was the synthesis of these background influences when they first came together, unexpect- edly, in Kentucky in 1800. Certainly those contemporaries who experi- enced the frontier camp meetings perceived them as strikingly novel religious developments, not familiar practices in a new locale. And that perception of novelty led the camp meeting to be associated with provi- dential intervention in history, an interpretation that credited God more than Turner's forest with the camp meetings' quick adaptation and 215</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF THE EARLY REPUBLIC sweep across the South. We must be careful not to underestimate how creative such hybrid institutions can be. The perception of the miracu- lous nature of the camp meeting changed over time, of course, and it ultimately became a routinized revival instrument. Turner, along with Mode and Sweet, led us to overvalue the role of the frontier. In reaction, we must not overvalue and isolate particular practices that were imported to the frontier. The historian's task is never to simplify the past but rather to see multiple causes and complex interactions. We have moved beyond the Turner thesis even though- truth be told-we still seldom employ definitional precision when we discuss the frontier. But Turner's ideas, and the counter-interpretations they have inspired, have caused a great outpouring of analytical effort to be focused on frontier religion. As a result, our understanding of the phenomenon has become far more sophisticated as we have learned how to contextualize what happened, for example, at Cane Ridge. History is largely the art of enhancing and enriching the number of connections we see between one event and others removed in time, geography, and domain. Frederick Jackson Turner, his disciples, and his critics together have widened the range of interpretative connections in the study of American religion. Frederick Jackson Turner Overlooked the Ladies Glenda Riley Like John Adams during the mid-1770s, Frederick Jackson Turner often failed to "remember the ladies." Although Turner was an observant and insightful historian, he overlooked the role of women in the United States' westward migration. In his path-breaking essay of 1893, "The Significance of the Frontier in American History," as well as in later articles and books, Turner characterized America's expansionist phase as a male phenomenon. Glenda Riley is the Alexander M. Bracken Professor of History at Ball State University. She is the author of many books and articles concerning women in the American West; her latest is A Place to Grow: Women in the American West (1992). She is currently completing an interpretive biography titled Annie Oakley and the Enduring West. The author would like to thank Richard W. Etulain, John L. Larson, and N.
