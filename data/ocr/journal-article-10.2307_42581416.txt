<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEMANTIC ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE AND MATHEMATICS* ANATOL RAPOPORT THE guage,' SAYING, becomes 'Mathematics significant when is a lan- we guage,' becomes significant when we examine both the ordinary languages and mathematics as peculiarly human forms of behavior. In both cases, the behavior consists of the manipulations of symbols. The object of mathematical manipulations (aside from utilitarian computations) is a mystery to many people, and even mathematicians do not generally agree as to why they behave as they do. We shall inquire into this matter later. It is gener- ally agreed, however, that the manipula- tion of the symbols of ordinary language is supposed to function in such a way that cognition of reality becomes trans- missible independently of direct experi- ence. Rudiments of language may exist among some animals. A whole group of individuals may become cognizant of danger without direct contact with it through a warning cry of one member, who is in direct contact with it. But this last qualifying clause is the paramount limitation of animal languages. The fact that this limitation has been surmounted by man is significant. An animal is capable of transmitting knowledge of 'danger or 'food' at hand but is incapable of saying, 'Last Tuesday I saw a panther with * Lecture delivered to members of the mathe- matics and English departments at the Univer- sity of Madras, July, 1945. four cubs in a ravine a mile and a half northwest from here/ Even less is an animal able to transmit knowledge acquired by experience to suc- ceeding generations. Man is able to do so, and this transmitted 'knowledge ac- cumulates into vast systems called cultures. That which malees possible indirect transmission of extremely complicated situations is called 'abstraction.' Certain aspects of a situation are stripped of all but very few attributes. A complex of these attributes is associated with a com- plex of sounds (a word). The word, when transmitted and received, is sup- posed to start a process in the recipient which reconstructs the situation. Of course the entire situation is never reconstructed, but enough of it is supposed to be recon- structed to serve the purpose of the com- munication. The advantages of this system are obvi- ous, but it often blows a fuse. How this happens is described in the literature on general semantics and allied subjects. General semantics traces these disturb- ances to confusion of orders of abstrac- tion. Entire cultures have become stagnant and degenerate because of the establish- ment of rigid behavior patterns governed by reactions to symbols. Such patterns vary widely, ranging from taboos of primitive demonologies to the intricate superstitions of high civilizations. In all 106</page><page sequence="2">SEMANTIC ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE AND MATHEMATICS cultures we find widespread evidence of preoccupation with word magic. In prim- itive societies patterns of behavior based on word-magic result in continued ignor- ance about the objective world, succumb- ing to disease, conquest by invaders, etc. In civilized society they result in mon- strously inefficient economic anarchy, psychoneuroses, devastating wars, etc. The aim of general semantics is in part to evaluate language as a motivating agency in human behavior. Clearly the important phase of such evaluation is the negative phase: one studies those prop- erties of language which prevent it from functioning as it should - the pathology of language, if you will. In such a study the examination of the methods of mathe- matical cognition is useful for compari- son, because mathematics in general does function as a language should, i.e., it en- ables mathematicians to draw like conclu- sions from like hypotheses. Let us therefore examine those char- acteristics of mathematics which are ab- sent or undeveloped in ordinary language. They are (1) Postulational Method, (2) Concept of Function, (3) Explicit De- lineation of Regions of Validity, and (4) Operational Definitions. Actually all four characteristics can be included in 'Operational Method,' which governs mathematical reasoning, and contrasted with the 'Substantive-Predicate Method' which governs the reasoning dominated by the structure of ordinary languages. But for clarity's sake, we shall subdivide it into the four divisions named and attempt to synthesize them later. Postulational Method The Greeks realized that if a system is to be constructed in which each proposi- tion depends on propositions previously deduced and each term or terms pre- viously defined, then the foundations of such a system must necessarily consist of unproved propositions and undefined terms. This explicit admission of the fact that certain propositions must remain un- proved and certain terms undefined im- plied that to establish the validity of a proposition one must prove it, and to establish the meaning of a term, one must define it. However, since an endless chain of proofs and definitions is impossible, one compromises by leaving a minimum of things unproved and undefined. But what the Greeks failed to realize was the arbitrariness with which undefined terms and unproved propositions of a self-con- sistent system can be chosen. Somehow, certain propositions (which they could not prove) seemed to them 'self-evident' and certain notions fundamental. To start with another set of propositions, even if they were self-consistent, would have meant to deny the 'truth' of the 'self-evident' propositions. Mathematicians, of course, realize the stifling effect of these 'self-evident truths' on the development of mathematics, pre- cluding, as they do, non-euclidean geo-, metries, abstract algebras, etc. However, we are interested here not so much in the limitations of Greek mathematics, but in the limitations of language, which has its roots in the same inadequate approach to the postulational method which charac- terized the attitude of the West to Greek geometry. The pernicious effect of Greek geometry lay paradoxically in its brilliant success. Here was a system of breath- taking beauty and compelling 'truth,' arrived at through the power of reason alone! Small wonder that the Greeks should conclude that this method ('truths' arrived at by formal logic from 'self- evident' propositions) is to be preferred to any other. In particular, there was a deep contempt for experiment, since ob- servations based on crude senses 'prove 107</page><page sequence="3">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS nothing.' This aversion for experiment is quite comprehensible to any lover of categorical conclusions based on deduc- tion. Imagine the exasperation of a math- ematician, attempting to prove a theorem of geometry, who is advised by a layman, 'Why don't you measure these segments to see if they are equal?' In itself, then, the disdain of the Greeks for experiment did exhibit a keen feeling for mathe- matics. Where it did most harm was in the assumption that these 'truths,' arrived at purely deductively, were truths about the objective world, and moreover that all truths of the objective world could be so deduced. The situation became even worse when the Greeks, seeing the dis- crepancies between reasoning and obser- vation, postulated an 'existence' of an ideal, perfect world, of which the ob- servable realities were but imperfect re- flections. To the modern mathematician geom- etry is not a natural science at all. The recognition of this fact exhibits the gulf between mathematics and the natural sci- ences. Only when this gulf becomes ap- parent can both mathematics and the natural sciences develop. On the one hand, the purely arbitrary character of the fundamental assumptions and the unde- fined terms of mathematics is recognized, clearing the way for the growth of gen- erality, the most rewarding direction of development. On the other hand, science is freed from 'eternal truths' and experi- mental fact is placed in its rightful posi- tion of supreme authority. Let us now turn to the role of 'self- evident truths' in non-mathematical cog- nition. Think of the damage done through the ages by such clich√©s as 'The whole is equal to the sum of all its parts.' The meanings of 'whole' and 'sum' and 'parts' are of course taken as self-evident. Try to apply this truth to actual situations. Are we to conclude that the magnitude of the resultant force is always the sum of the magnitudes of its components? Are we to conclude that colinear velocities always add up to their algebraic sum? The helium atom is made of the same 'things' as four hydrogen atoms. How to explain the discrepancy in mass? Other self-evident truths have gone the same way but not before they did their part in holding back the growth of knowledge: 'Where there is motion, there is a mover.' 'A thing exists only because there is a sufficient reason for its existence.' 'Causes always precede effects. ' All these maxims, so vital to philoso- phers and theologians, become meaning- less noises in view of our present knowl- edge of the universe obtained from ob- servations and controlled experiment and critical attitude to procedures. The dis- covery that mathematics is a postularono!, not an experimental, system, freed man's thinking processes and delivered both mathematics and the experimental sci- ences from sclerosis. Function Function in mathematics is analogous to 'causality' in ordinary languages. But we shall see how 'function' is a very much more precise term (an operational term), and this will shed some light on the in- adequacy of the notion of causality. 'Causality' in ordinary languages is riddled with anthropomorphic notions and magic. With the savage, demons 'make' misfortunes. With us gravity causes objects to fall. 'Laziness' and 'Lack of Ambition' cause poverty. So men in the pulpits attack 'lust' and 'greed,' and politicians attack 'Isms' as if they had ob- jective existence like crocodiles. The problem of knowing the world is 108</page><page sequence="4">SEMANTIC ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE AND MATHEMATICS not the problem of finding 'what makes it so?' but of finding sets of conditions of which we can say, 'If thus, then so.' The problem is completely solved when we can interchange the 'thus' and the 'so/ i.e., when we can also say, 'If so, then thus.' When this happens, 'cause' and 'effect' become useless terms. For ex- ample, in curvilinear motion, the physi- cist will describe the relation between force, mass, velocity, and radius of curva- ture. He does not look at these elements as either 'causes' or 'effects.' It is no more true that an increase in the radius of curvature causes a decrease in force than vice versa, or than that an increase of velocity causes an increase in force or vice versa. These things are simply re- lated as described. In pure mathematics finding such set of completely inter- changeable conditions is called finding 'necessary and sufficient conditions.' Some of the sharpest tools of mathematical rea- soning, particularly in analysis, are di- rected towards these ends. Let us now turn to the squabbles that accompany attempts to determine 'causes' and 'effects' in our world, come hell or high water. Does a 'culture' determine an 'economy' of a society or vice versa. ? Do leaders influence the collective will of a group or are they themselves influenced by it? Is a low standard of living caused by apathy of individuals or is it itself a cause? As we have seen, the physicist in his investigations usually ignores such questions of priority. He will never worry about whether a moving magnetic field causes an electrostatic field or whether the moving electric charge causes a magnetic field. The two go together. If agencies enter into the picture at all, it is the physicist himself. He can 'make' a mag- netic field by moving an electric field and vice versa. The fact that in our study of society we are vitally interested in mak- ing certain conditions leads us to postu- late the existence of 'agencies.' As a mat- ter of fact, the only agencies are our- selves, and the effects of our influence depend on how thoroughly we understand the laws of motion of society, in which no agencies operate but only sets of cor- related conditions. The question of causes and effects, then, reduces to a purely utilitarian question, namely, which sets of conditions can be most effectively con- trolled. Suppose we find that in a society in which security is considered synonymous with accumulation of private wealth, the energies of individuals are largely di- rected toward such accumulation, and sets of values are established which preclude the growth of cooperative activity. And suppose that these conditions are found to be accompanied by a predominance of infantile personalities in that society, a frequency of frustration neuroses, high incidence of insanity, and crime. All these phenomena are observable. But they are all observed by people with different points of view about 'cause' and 'effect.' The man in the pulpit will ascribe the deplorable state of affairs to 'moral de- generation,' which in turn is 'caused' by loss of faith. His solution is to 'make' each individual regain faith in and fear of God. He cannot reach every individual, but he thinks that if he could, he could induce the necessary changes. Accordingly his efforts are directed to increasing church membership. The individual psy- chologist thinks society would become 'mature' if each individual became emo- tionally mature. This would happen if more people participated in cooperative effort. But he reaches even fewer persons than the man in the pulpit and often be- comes discouraged. The social reformer thinks that the root of the evil lies in the fact that security depends on indi- 109</page><page sequence="5">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS vidual accumulation of wealth and tries to effect legislation to make security a responsibility of society. The revolution- ist thinks that social reforms are inade- quate so long as a class, in whose interest it is to accumulate, perpetuates itself in power. He therefore speaks in terms of class struggle and seizure of power. But seizure of power depends on organized and disciplined collective effort, of which people conditioned to grasping for indi- vidual welfare only are not capable. The vicious circle is closed. Whatever the outcome of that hypo- thetical sad state of affairs may be, I think you will agree that it is worth while to study similar situations. It is very difficult to study society with any degree of detachment for obvious reasons. But this we must do if we wish to be success- ful in our studies as the physicist was successful in his. To achieve this necessary objectivity, we must imitate the physicist rather than the savage. We must not look for devils and agencies, because these are too easily found and are of no use once they are found except to make faces at. We must do as the physicist does and correlate sets of conditions. The language for expressing such correlations is the functional language of mathematics. Explicit Delineations of Regions of Validity No mathematical statement can be made without a more or less explicit de- lineation of its region of validity. In theorems these regions are defined by the conditions of the hypothesis. In defini- tions they are restricted to the range of operation. Thus the Pythagorean Theo- rem applies to certain objects in a certain universe, i.e., to right triangles in euclid- ean space. Of other triangles and other spaces, the conclusion of the theorem is false. A function is a mathematical defi- nition, e.g., y - y 25 - x2 is a definition of y which states in part, 'If X is ¬±3, y is 4; if x is ¬± 4, y is 3; if X is ¬±5, j is 0, etc., for an infinity of other values of x between -5 and 5.' If y is real, no other real values of x except those between -5 and + 5 can be included in the definition, otherwise we immediately become involved in con- tradictions. Thus the validity of both theorems and definitions in mathematics is lucidly restricted by the structure of mathematical language itself. Let us see what happens in ordinary language. Aristotelian logic gives us the rules of reasoning embodied in (1) Identity: A is A. (2) Non-contradiction: A cannot be both B and not-B. (3) Excluded middle: A must be either B or not-B. These laws would be acceptable if there were anything in the objective world to which they could be unqualifiedly ap- plied. As a matter of fact, such applica- tions are completely valid only with re- spect to mathematical entities1 simply be- cause the latter are so constructed as to make these laws apply. What outside of mathematics can be substituted for A and still preserve the validity of (1)? Man is Man? But Man with a capital M is an abstraction, not a reality. Even men' con- sidered as 'objects' are abstractions. A minute examination of a man will reveal such a conglomeration of processes and reactions as to make any even approxi- mately complete description impossible. As I speak before you, I become a dif- ferent set of particles and processes each moment. We do not live in a world of 1 Some mathematicians maintain that even with regard to some mathematical structures (3) is invalid. 110</page><page sequence="6">SEMANTIC ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE AND MATHEMATICS objects' of which assertions can be made. Only the predominance of nouns in our substantive-predicate languages gives us that illusion. We live in a world of events, and no camera exists which can freeze these events into a picture which will stand still while we describe it. Yet the categorical majesty of 'A is A' leads people to translate it without compunc- tion into 'Pigs is Pigs,' 'Jews are Jews,' 'Indians are Indians,' and 'You can't change human nature.' The same considerations apply to (2) and (3). We know very well that this desk may be said to be both to the right and to the left of this chair; that Cal- cutta can be said to be both east and west of Karachi ; that the length and mass of bodies have different values to different observers; but the tyranny of (2) pre- vents people from realizing many of these truths. The corruption of (3) is the most prevalent. This abuse is what general semanticists call the two-valued orienta- tion. Even the history of mathematics is full of man-made paradoxes and dilem- mas which resulted from indiscriminate application of the Law of Excluded Middle. Numbers were thought of as necessarily either integers or fractions, blocking the study of irrational roots of equations. With the recognition of the real number system, numbers were still thought of as either positive or negative, blocking the study of complex numbers, etc. The weakness of Aristotelian logic lies not in the principles above but in the fact that we think of the vast complexes of events as indivisible 'objects' with in- divisible 'attributes' (because we desig- nate them by individual words) . We for- get that no single statement made about a conglomeration of things need be valid even if deduced by formal logic from those principles. Mathematical reasoning teaches us to break up seemingly simple concepts into still simpler ones and seemingly indivisible conditions into sets of independent conditions. Thus it con- stantly refines its concepts by delineating regions of validity. The most brilliant advances of science can be traced to a similar method. As long as temperature, rigidity, elasticity, mass, were regarded as properties of bodies, and bodies themselves as frag- ments of reality, molecular physics could not come into being. With the birth of molecules, all the properties above lost their absolute meaning, since they could be applied only statistically to large num- bers of molecules, not to individual ones. More and more the physicist is aware of the necessity of giving qualified answers. Is space euclidean? Yes, within suffi- ciently small regions and away from large masses of matter. Is behavior of inani- mate matter predictable? Yes, if matter is taken in large enough quantities. In short, it becomes clear that questions which only yesterday seemed straight- forward, demanding an 'either-or' answer, today dissolve into ambiguities, which cannot be answered without a drastic re- vision and sharpening of concepts. Operational Definitions We now come to the most powerful tool of mathematical logic, the operational definition. We see the struggle to 'de- fine terms' already in full swing in Socrates' time. Aristotle clearly stated the definition of a Definition, and he stated it in operational terms. That is to say, he did not apply the principle of 'definition' to defining Definition itself. Instead, he proceeded as a general se- manticist or a mathematician would do. He tells us not what a Definition 'is,' but what to do in order to make a defi- ni</page><page sequence="7">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS nition. Place a thing to be defined in a class; then name the properties which distinguish it from other members of its class. Now strictly speaking, every such defi- nition would itself be operational, if the operations indicated could be performed. A definition consists of directions telling us what to do to recognize the thing de- fined. The weakness of aristotelian defi- nitions lies not in the method itself but in its non-applicability in a great number of situations, its only partial applicability to others, and, most of all, in its un- critical acceptance in all situations as in- fallible (as, e.g., people accept dictionary definitions) . Let us take some homely examples. What is a Negro? Suppose we are told (as we possibly would be by the first per- son in the street) that a Negro is a per- son with a black skin. No matter that an anthropologist or a student of 'race' will give a considerably more sophisticated definition. It will merely result in more sophisticated contradictions. On the face of it the definition is 'operational'; that is, it tells us what to do to recognize a "Negro.' First determine whether he is a 'person,' next whether he has a 'black skin.' Assuming we know how to recog- nize 'persons' and where to look for 'skin,' what can we say about 'black? A scientific definition of black immediately reveals that no skin is black ; in fact there are no black objects at all in this world. Of course our man in the street will im- mediately correct himself and say he meant 'dark.' But how dark is dark? Let us suppose we have determined that. Yet every person in this room except myself has skin as dark as the skins of American Negroes, and our man will not call you ^Negroes.' He will say you are 'Indians.' But when we ask for a definition of that, he will be in even greater difficulties. Of course the examples we used were quite crude. For all I know, workable definitions of 'Negro' or 'Indian' may exist. By 'workable' I mean accomplish- ing their purpose. Where people are de- termined to accomplish their purpose, they will employ 'workable' definitions. In some parts of the United States, the chief purpose of 'defining' Negroes is to bar them from certain activities. Ac- cordingly Negroes are defined simply as 'those people whom we (the Whites) call Negroes.' In many of our newspapers Communists are similarly defined as 'those people whom we call Communists.' These definitions are 'workable' because they ac- complish the purpose of the definer. Moreover, they are unassailable, because they are tautological. To the scientist, for whom a definition must serve the purpose of recognition, not as a means of pinning the same labels on people he doesn't like, these 'definitions' are, of course, quite worthless. Actually neither a Negro nor an Indian can be defined at all except purely arbitrarily, because no such thing exists in the objective world. The scientist, to whom definitions must serve as tools to further knowledge, is forced to use operational definitions, where the operations consist of examin- ing criteria, and the workability of a defi- nition will depend on whether the opera- tions indicated are realizable and precise. All definitions of real entities are there- fore limited by the inexactness of our observations and by the fact that our words are only abstractions of these en- tities and not the entities themselves. In metaphysics and theology, on the other hand, the operational side of aristotelian definition was completely lost, and only its sterile grammatical structure remained. 'What is God?' asks the Catechism. And the answer is in perfect grammatical form, 'God is a spirit, omnipotent, om- 112</page><page sequence="8">SEMANTIC ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE AND MATHEMATICS niscient, and ubiquitous.' Similarly the metaphysicist asks, 'What is Space? What is Time?, etc.,' and even the early physicists inherited the habit in their questions, 'What is Fire? What is Heat? What is Electricity?' The modern physicist has long discarded the question 'What is . . .' and asks instead 'What does . . .?' Nor is this in any way a re- treat or admission of failure as many amateur philosophers (and some profes- sional ones) insist, complaining that 'The physicists describe the how, but they will never be able to tell the why. They learn all about what electricity does, but they still haven't found out what elec- tricity is! It is only the structure of our language and the pernicious thought habit of ac- cepting definitions, which merely equate terms (as dictionary and catechism defi- nitions do) that prevent us from realiz- ing that does is the only content of is. Here indeed lies the greatest value of mathematics as a semantic discipline. All mathematical definitions are made in terms of operations, and the entities thus defined have no further content than that defined by the operations. In the develop- ment of the complex number system, negative numbers are defined by extend- ing an operation (namely, the inverse of addition) to all ordered couples of posi- tive integers; rational numbers are de- fined by extending another operation (di- vision) to all ordered pairs of integers; algebraic numbers by extending the operation of factoring to all polynomials with rational coefficients, real numbers by extending the operation of passing to the limit to all sequences of rational numbers, etc. The same is true of functions. Functions defined by quadratures, by solutions of differential equations, by series, etc., are all examples of mathe- matical entities defined by operations alone. Mathematicians have long since recognized the irrelevancy to knowledge of the question 'What is . . .?' But un- fortunately this formulation and the con- fusion which accompanies it still haunts our thinking about what we consider with varying degrees of error as the 'real uni- verse.' As examples of extensions of this se- mantic emancipation brought by mathe- matics long ago to our inquiries about the universe, the advances of modern physics again stand in the limelight. The so-called difficulties of understanding the Special Theory of Relativity vanish im- mediately and irrevocably as soon as one begins to think of such 'absolutes' as time and space in terms of operations neces- sary to define them. One says, 'In order to determine the "length" of an object, one proceeds as follows. ... In order to determine the time sequence of two events, one proceeds as follows . . / Length and Duration are then readings which result from the procedures, and they have no further co?7tent. All ques- tions about the 'real,' the 'intrinsic,' the 'absolute' values of these quantities be- come meaningless. Again the so-called dilemmas of sub- atomic physics are immediately resolved when one realizes that the term 'position of an electron' has a meaning only when one is able to say, 'To determine the po- sition of the electron at a given moment, one proceeds as follows . . .' Then, when it turns out that no such procedure can be devised (this has nothing to do with the precision of our measurements but with a much deeper question) , the eman- cipated thinker merely shrugs his should- ers and says, 'The meaning of the term "position at a given moment" is delin- eated by the possibility of defining it operationally.' He does not worry about such concepts exploding any more than 113</page><page sequence="9">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS any physicist worries about the fact that 'elasticity' and 'rigidity' become mean- ingless on certain levels of observation. Here we see the connection between the power of operational definitions (first recognized with full clarity in mathe- matics) and the other semantic aspects of mathematics, which can be summarized as the Operational Method. Delineation of validity is closely connected with opera- tional definitions, because the latter, by exhibiting the operations employed, de- termine the region of validity. The con- cept of function is likewise bound up with operation: in mathematics obviously, in observation of reality somewhat more indirectly through the operations of which observation itself consists. Finally the recognition of the postulational nature of mathematics sheds light on the exclusive- ness of the deductive method (also an operation) in mathematical cognition. It exhibits a gulf between our knowledge of our own inner processes (which is the only reality reflected in mathematical truths) and our knowledge of the out- side world, in which observational, rather than deductive, operations are supreme. We can trace many blockings of progress of knowledge directly to the failure to realize that the conclusions of inductive reasoning are only guesses. 'All men are mortal,' goes the first exercise in syllogism; 'Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal.' How did we get to say 'all men are mortal?' By observing that Smith has died and Jones has died, and Krishna- murti has died, etc. If 'all men are mortal' is a certainty, then the observa- tion must have included all men, also Socrates. If it did, there is no need to prove him mortal by the syllogism. If it did not, 'all men are mortal' is only a guess, a very good guess, to be sure, worthwhile betting on, but one which can be disproved by a single counter-example. Many modern scholasticists do not feel that way. According to some of them, the above mentioned observations lead us to a conclusion about an inherent property of Man (not just men), i.e., Mortality. This property is inseparably bound up with the 'nature' of Man as the Pytha- gorean property is bound up with right triangles. This attitude reflects the insis- tence of metaphysics on postulating the existence of an ultimate reality, 'about' which we are getting bits of partial knowledge. In this reality there exist' concepts, categories, and properties, all those things which we ourselves had in- vented as tools to cognition. To a scien- tist these ghosts are useless in his work, but many scientists prefer to reserve a fond corner for them much as a senti- mental wom√¢n keeps her dolls in the at- tic till her old age. Most scientists are aware that the value of a language is of the same order as the value of a map. More and more natural science begins to recognize the superiority of mathematics as the language of science. This realization has come simply from the failure of introspective and syllogistic methods of philosophy and from the suc- cess of painstaking observations and quantitative descriptions. Especially to the members of the mathe- matics department, much of what I have said must have appeared pretty obvious. The members of the English department, however, by whose presence I am greatly flattered, could probably profit well by acquainting themselves with some general principles of mathematics and with some mathematical technique. I understand English classes exist in order to teach people to use the English language. The question arises : 'Why should the English language, or any language, for that mat- ter, be used at all?' I can think of two 114</page><page sequence="10">SEMANTIC ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE AND MATHEMATICS answers: (1) To establish bonds among a group of human beings; (2) To estab- lish bonds among all human beings. Now to achieve (1) language does not have to be a map of any reality. One can invent a most absurd Neverland, and if all the human beings in the group are thoroughly familiar with every feature of that Neverland, a bond exists between them. Such are the languages of savages (primitive and civilized) whose worlds of demons and taboos, unreal as they are, are shared by all the members. Thus, a society can exist based on a common cul- tural bond, even if there is no reality be- hind it. But such a society is doomed. Eventually they will come in contact with another society speaking the language of another Neverland, and the language of the first group will be a meaningless jab- ber to the others, and they will appear as another species to them, to be extermi- nated. The stronger will destroy the weaker. If we consider such clashes lamentable, we should try to bring about (2). This does not at all mean that everyone should speak English or Sanskrit or Tamil, any more than it is important what colors afe used for topographical and political fea- tures of maps. What is important is that the maps should all be of the same country. The question arises : What country? What set of beliefs, cultural values, ethical values, etc.? Perhaps there is an answer. The biological fact that mankind is a single species provides a hope that he can learn to speak the same language. This language will not be a map of this or that Neverland. It will be a verifiable language, because it will consist of 'if thus, then so' propositions. In other words, it will be a map of real territories described in operational terms. English teachers no less than mathema- ticians have a crucial role to play in disciplining languages into becoming in- struments of human integration. Metaphysics, in the proper sense of the word, is dialectical physics, or an attempt to determine matters of fact by means of logical or moral or rhetorical constructions. ... It is neither physical speculation nor pure logic nor honest literature, but (as in the treatise of Aristotle first called by that name) a hybrid of the three, materialising ideal entities, turning harmonies into forces, and dis- solving natural things in terms of discourse. Santayana, Scepticism and Animal Faith ‚ô¶ An infantile logic, now happily expelled from physical science, taught that opium put men to sleep because of its dormitive potency. We follow the same logic in social matters when we believe that war exists because of bellicose instincts; or that a particular eco- nomic regime is necessary because of acquisitive and competitive impulses which must find expression.
