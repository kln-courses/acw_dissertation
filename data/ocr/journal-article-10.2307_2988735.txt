<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 243 SHORTER NOTICES A HUNDRED YEARS OF BRITISH PHILOSOPHY. By Dr. Rudolf Metz. Trans- lated by J. W. Harvey, T. E. Jessop, and Henry Sturt. Edited by J. H. Muirhead. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, I938. Pp. 828. 25s. This is a valuable and interesting summary of the doctrines and theories of philosophers in Great Britain since Thomas Reid and including contemporary writers such as Professor Susan Stebbing. The dates of the lives of the writers on philosophy and their chief works are given and Dr. Metz shows conspicuous fairness to all types of theory, but there is an obvious difficulty in applying the same words and phrases to an explanation of very diverse philosophical atti- tudes. Thus the author is never quite free from the perhaps unconscious im- plications of the words "object" and "subject" when he is dealing with modern realism. But all philosophy suffers from the defects of an inherited and tradi- tional terminology; and the invention of such new words as "emergence" does not make explanation any easier. Half the difficulties of philosophical discus- sion are probably due to the language in which different philosophers are ac- customed to think. But even the newest view of the connection between lan- guage and philosophy in Mr. Ayer's work is included in this comprehensive volume. Dr. Metz has not escaped from some of the possibly misleading phrases which his own type of thinking leads him to use. For example, in dealing with the philosophical outlook of Sir Percy Nunn it is doubtful whether he repre- sents Nunn's position correctly in saying that "the grouping and combining of them [fictions and fancies] is the work of the mind." However, the summary in all cases is conspicuously fair as a whole. The sections of the book which seem to be of more doubtful value are those which include summaries of the ideas of such writers as Sir Oliver Lodge, which have only the very slightest connection with anything that can be called philosophy. The writings of George Tyrrell and of Friedrich von Hugel are discussed very admirably; but in this case also it is doubtful whether philosophy in the usual sense of the word is the chief interest. And in the case of such writers as Walter Bagehot and Sir James Frazer, the connection with philosophy is indeed obscure. Dr. Metz's book, however, includes references to nearly all the British writers on serious subjects during the past century, and the book is therefore of value as a sort of British "Who's Who" in the realm of exact thought upon certain fundamental issues. Unfortunately there is no explanation attempted of the change from "Oxford" idealism in the nineteenth century to "Cambridge" realism in the twentieth-or are the social and political changes, which influ- enced thinkers, at all adequately explained. In consequence the record is like a succession of accidents in the lives of separate atoms. But even as a "Who's Who" the Index is inadequate and omits the names of some authors mentioned in the text. As a work of reference, however, this translation of a German view of British thinkers will be essential for use in any library. C. D.

The introductory part of this book is essentially a condensed recapitulation of views which the author has previously expressed in such books as Vorstudien zur Metaphysik (I92I), Ideeller Aufbau und Metaphysik des Denkens (I929), Das erlebende Ich (I932), and Dasein und Bewusstsein (I933). And for a reader without some knowledge of this background the present "summary" is likely to remain obscure on many important points. Taking up the theme of the last-named book, Professor Janssen accepts as an "ultimate and indissoluble ideal specification of determinateness" the un- translatable term Dasein. He distinguishes Dasein from "existence," "reality," the "actual," and the "perceptible," and maintains (against Husserl and the idealists) that Dasein must not be confused with "being for," or "being content of," consciousness. After all, Janssen points out, the experiencing subject, in its "attitude of intention," is itself imminent in the Daseinsfeld and, all ego- centricity notwithstanding, does not "constitute" it. The Daseinsfeld has its own specific and "objective" structure, and this structure finds its ideal completion in "concepts of something" which logically transcend Dasein proper and which, by virtue of their "foundation in Dasein," make possible some inferences concerning the nature of reality. The procedure which Janssen employs in his attempt to "penetrate to the realm of the real" differs from that of Heidegger in that it avoids the recourse to "moods"; and it is diametrically opposed to that of Kant in that it denies that the structure is "imposed by the subject." In Janssen's book I find affinities with Nicolai Hartmann's position of a "neutral ontology"; but there seems to be an even closer affinity in spirit between this book and Driesch's Wirklichkeitslehre of twelve or fifteen years ago. I regard it as a distinct merit of Janssen's book that it calls to our attention rather forcefully the problem of "ideal Being"-a problem which Nicolai Hart- mann, for example, has not seen in its true significance; and I believe that what Janssen has to say about the foundation of "ideal Being" in Dasein is essen- tially sound. I am likewise sure that Janssen's "metaphysics of the organism" (as distinguished from all "metaphysics of things") effectively eliminates the pitfalls of vitalism and mechanism. But whether Janssen's doctrine of a "meta- physical finality"-although it allows for "creativeness" and "free will"-is in itself sufficient and complete is a different question. I do not see, for example, that the brief references to the ontological status of values really open up the field for effective analysis, nor how a solution of the value problem could be found in "organismic finality." In his metaphysical arguments Janssen has made most effective use of the implications of instincts-particularly where instincts transcend the interests of individuals; and what he says with respect to these implications deserves most serious consideration. But Janssen's arguments based upon para-psycho- logical phenomena, upon mental telepathy, clairvoyance, and "materializa-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 245 tions," mar a book which is otherwise a commendable attempt to cope in its way with notoriously difficult problems. The involved and ponderous style of Janssen's book-sentences of I50 and more words are by no means rare-appeals but little to the English-speaking reader. And the many misprints which remain even after the author's suggested corrections have been made, add confusion to the difficulty. W. H. WERKMEISTER PHILOSOPHIE UND PADAGOGIK PAUL HAEBERLINS IN THREN WANDLUNGEN. By Peter Kamm. Munich: Ernst Reinhardt, I938. Pp. 479. Rm. 6.8o. This Basle dissertation, devoted to the most prominent contemporary Swiss philosopher and professor in the same university, while trying a "longitudinal section" through his work under a pedagogical aspect, distinguishes four major stages in its development. According to Kamm a first period, characterized by the basic religious outlook of the former theological student, is followed by an idealistic moralism subordinating all cultural life to the supreme obligatory end of realizing the ideal-still derived, however, from God. A return to a re- ligious philosophy intended to reconcile the inadequacy of actual problematical life to the ideal is finally superseded by a theoretical philosophy based on "theoria," a rather peculiar contemplation of life "from the viewpoint of per- fect transcendence," now distinguished from God, allegedly revealing the un- created and unconditional perfection of actual existence. Kamm's procedure consists in giving concise summaries of Haeberlin's chief works-no small merit in the case of such a prolific and often involved writer-each time followed by careful comparisons between the consecutive publications. No further interpre- tation or criticism is added. Kamm himself is aware that this method fails to give complete understanding of Haeberlin's shifts, particularly as his writings contain no explicit account of them, nor do they make much reference to con- temporary thinkers, although they show very instructive parallels to (if not influences from) German philosophy-e.g., in the decline of idealism and various traces of "existentialism." The voluminous book would have gained substantially by shortening, being not free from repetitions and a certain circumstantiality in places. Otherwise it shows all the advantages and disadvantages of a study from close quarters. To those interested in German philosophy outside the Reich this painstaking monograph will prove a useful introduction to a thinker who needs one in a particular degree. HERBERT SPIEGELBERG SymBoLIsM AND BELIEF. By Edwyn Bevan. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, I938. Pp. 39I. I5S. Dr. Edwyn Bevan has here given us a book which will be of peculiar value to those interested in the philosophy of religion, which could most profitably be read by those of the philosophical fashion which claims that the chief, if not the sole, occupation of philosophers should be to consider "how we use words."</page><page sequence="4">246 ETHICS For Dr. Bevan is not only a scholar, historian, and ph losopher of religion, but one of the living masters of English prose. And his sense of the fitting in lan- guage makes him particularly qualified to deal with the problem of this book- namely, the uses of figurative and symbolic language to indicate something about the nature of transcendent reality. Religion, at any rate in its classical historical forms, has claimed to have to do with some transcendent reality. But the concepts in which it expresses itself are shot through with metaphors drawn from spatiotemporal experience. In what sense can symbols embodying such metaphor be valid expressions of the nature of what is supersensible? Dr. Bevan shows that an important distinction can be drawn between symbols which are substitutes for conceptual expressions into which they can be ade- quately translated, and symbols "behind which we cannot go." The symbols of religion are of both kinds, but its more important symbols are of the latter kind. They move in a realm in which the symbol may be the best we can do, because it records a total impression of significant value. This may better be done in poetic language, which we know does not mean literally what it says, than in language which may be misleadingly clear in making us think we under- stand more than we do. Dr. Bevan forces the question of how far symbols which are not conceptually translatable may be known to be not only expressive (as they certainly are), but also indicative of meaning beyond themselves. He shows that the symbols even of "primitive" religion may be guided by a feeling of appropriateness in the association of ideas. Perhaps he might have pursued further the question of whether such feeling of appropriateness of response must depend to some extent on a right apprehension of the nature of that to which we respond. This book contains incidental discussions of extreme interest. Of these I shall only mention his considered defense of the necessity for a retributive ele- ment in punishment; and his discussion of the doctrine of analogy as held by certain Catholic theologians. The latter, incidentally, shows clearly the cul- pable ignorance of writers such as Professor Julian Huxley, Mr. Gerald Heard, and Mr. Walter Lippmann, when they assume in their popular books on religion that theologians within the orthodox tradition had no perception of the"anthro- pomorphism" of their symbols, or held any philosophical view which guarded against its dangers. On the contrary, the use of anthropomorphic imagery may be appropriate on a level where it represents "not the naivete of the man who has never perceived its philosophical inadequacy, but the result of a scepticism pushed far enough to feel the inadequacy of all philosophical formulas offered as a substitute." DOROTHY M. EMMET CRITICAL REALISM. STUDIES IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF MIND AND NATURE. By G. Dawes Hicks. London: Macmillan, I938. Pp. xxiv+346. I5s. This volume does not contain a continuously written argument, but con- sists of the following papers, published between the years i9i6 and I934: (I) "The Basis of Critical Realism" (I947); (2) "The Sensum Theory" (i9i6); (3)</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 247 "Sensible Appearances and Material Things" (I922); (4) "On the Nature of Images" (I924); (5) "Conceptual Thought and Real Existence" (I933); (6) "F. H. Bradley's Treatment of Nature" (I925); (7) "The Dynamic Aspect of Nature" (I925); (8) "Professor Eddington's Philosophy of Nature" (I929); (9) "Is the Mind a Compound Substance?" (I926); (iO) "The Refutation of Sub- jectivism" (I934); (II) "The Philosophical Researches of Meinong" (I922); (I2) "The 'Modes' of Spinoza and the 'Monads' of Leibniz" (I9I8). These papers, however, despite the diversity of the subjects with which they deal, form a genuine unity in that they all seek to establish or supplement a distinctive type of realism which Mr. Dawes Hicks has developed in opposition to certain current theories of knowledge in general and of perception in par- ticular. As is to be expected, certain papers are more directly relevant than certain others. Many topics are dealt with in addition to the theory of perception. The paper on Meinong is particularly valuable as an introduction to the work of this im- portant and difficult philosopher. Moreover, Mr. Dawes Hicks is at home in a field which lies between the territory of the philosopher and that of the psy- chologist, but is no longer cultivated by either, so that much of what he has to say is not only valuable in itself, but is an important contribution to a branch of study that at present suffers from neglect. JAMES DREVER, JR. SYPHILIS, GONORRHEA AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH. By Nels A. Nelson and Gladys L. Crain. New York: Macmillan, I938. Pp. 359. $3.oo. This book, written by the director and the epidemiologist of the Division of Genitoinfectious Diseases of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, is designed "to present the essential known facts concerning syphilis and gon- orrhea, .... give an account of the development of control programs to date and discuss the direction which they are taking." This the authors have done exceedingly well. They write in clear, accurate, but nontechnical language and cover the field thoroughly. The work can be recommended to any nonmedical person desiring information in this field. There is an excellent index. NORRIS L. BROOKENS THE MIDDLE WAY. By Harold Macmillan. London: Macmillan, I938. Pp. 383. 5S. Mr. Harold Macmillan is a Conservative member of Parliament who has attempted for some years to argue the case for an extension of the state organi- zation of British trade, finance, and industry. The present book is an extension of Mr. Macmillan's earlier book Reconstruction. Is is mainly concerned with what are usually called economic issues. But evidently one of the governing forces in the author's mind is a sense of justice. "The meaning of social prog- ress," he writes, "is the liberation of men from want, and the unfolding of new possibilities of a more satisfactory and abundant life." But the conception of justice implied in the whole book is never clearly defined. If progress is to</page><page sequence="6">248 ETHICS liberate men, what particular men is Mr. Macmillan thinking about? His ob- jection to a decision of the majority in any community as the basis for industrial organization is that the majority might be tyrannous. "The unwilling minor- ity," he says, "might quite reasonably say that they had no desire to possess or use" certain luxuries. But the real difficulty at present in most countries is that a minority desire such luxuries and are able to enforce their will upon the majority. The author sees that we have reached the end of the possibilities of state charity for the poor drawn from taxation of the rich. And he proposes, there- fore, a fundamental reconstruction of the system of production and distribution in Great Britain. The grounds for this are given in descriptions of the poverty and malnutrition which have survived all efforts to reduce them by the social services. The evidence Mr. Macmillan uses has all been collected by economists and social observers who are not conservative, but he does not accept the solu- tion of the difficulties which many of these critics of the existing system would prefer. Instead he advocates a program that is much more like that of the Labour party in Great Britain than like that of his own party, except that he proposes to leave certain new industries under the control of what is called ''private enterprise." The whole scheme is aimed at attracting what are called the "young conservatives" in Great Britain, and there is no reference to non- British experiments in the organization of industry or finance by a central gov- ernment. The book is, in fact, a political pamphlet arguing in favor of a form of con- servative policy which may have some support in the future, but is not likely to be adopted by the Conservative party as we know it today. Its importance is not in its economic schemes; but it is a sign that conceptions of social justice are beginning to affect supporters of the traditional system of production and distribution. It is regrettable that these conceptions of justice are still so vague and emotional, and that those who are moved by them spend most of their intellectual energies upon economic, and not upon ethical, problems. Mr. Mac- millan, for example, never faces the problem whether any supply of goods, which is organized by those whose chief aim is the accumulation of private wealth, can possibly be adequate from the point of view of the consumer. Clear- ly injustice in a social situation may be due, not to ill-will, but to the uncon- scious acceptance of obsolete political or economic habits. C. D. B. ASPECTS OF HISTORY. By E. E. Kellett. London: Cape, I938. Pp. i6o. 5s. This small book is not written for specialists in history but for the ordinary educated man who enjoys reading the great historians. The most important chapter for the student of ethics is that on "History as Ethics." But all the chapters are of interest in so far as history, whether as theology or propaganda or science, embodies the moral judgments of the historian. It is important to recognize that no historian is without some moral judgment although few seem to be conscious of the nature of the judgments which they imply when they give us the biographies of great men or the record of great events. Lord Acton is</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS 249 taken as an example of a historian who studied all the facts as a scientist would, but expressed them in very decided moral judgments. "Great men," he held, "are nearly always bad men; and the more powerful a man is, the worse he probably will be." Mr. Kellett is particularly critical of Carlyle, who had "an extraordinary gift for dressing up prejudice so as to look like moral indigna- tion." Altogether Mr. Kellett's book should be of great value to students of the moral sciences, and its small size is an advantage for inducing the philosopher as well as the historian to think twice before accepting the traditional view of what is important among the events and the personalities of history. C. D. B. MODERN MAN AND RELIGION. By T. G. Masaryk. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin. Pp. viii+320. 7s. 6d. MASARYK ON THOUGHT AND LIFE: CONVERSATIONS WITH KAREL CAPEK. Lon- don: George Allen &amp; Unwin. Pp. 2I4. 7s. 6d. At a moment when the future of the Czechoslovak Republic hangs in the balance, we must turn with especial interest to any of the writings of its phi- losopher founder (perhaps one of the few really impressive "philosopher kings" in history). The former of these two translations is a collection of articles written at the close of the last century; the latter is a record of conversations with the well-known Czech writer. They therefore show us something of Masa- ryk's mind at two stages of his remarkable life: first, as the academic critic; second, as the statesman in his old age, defending vigorously his belief in clear empirical thinking on the one hand, and in the future of democracy on the other-beliefs which, as both these books show, were grounded for him in re- ligious faith. Of the two books, the former is the fuller, and, from a philosophical point of view, the more interesting; but the essays which it comprises presuppose some considerable knowledge of the writers with whom they deal. Those on Hume and Comte are particularly interesting. (But why do Continental intellectuals always select Byron as the English poet par excellence, and even as the "repre- sentative of the English Protestant spirit"?) The latter book will be of the greater use to the general reader who wants to know something of the "phi- losophy of life" of a great man. Both books show Masaryk's sturdy optimism for the future of humanity and of democratic and international ideals, for the future of his country, which he believed had a peculiar opportunity for further- ing those ideals-optimistic words which we must, perhaps, now read with certain grim forebodings. Both the "conversations" and the critical discussions of certain German philosophers and men of letters make clearer part of the underlying tragedy of the present situation; namely, that this democratic, in- ternational faith which seems so obvious to Masaryk, and to most Frenchmen, Englishmen, and Americans, is very unobvious and alien to the predominant German romantic spirit, in its deeper manifestations as well as in its political travesties. Whoever was responsible for seeing the translations of both these books through the press has left a good many misprints in phrases and passages quoted</page><page sequence="8">250 ETHICS from other languages. In Modern Man and Religion I have noticed a consider- able number of misprints in German quotations; in the Conversations Greek phrases are shaky (e.g., on p. 72, 7ravra ete for -7rara peZ, and on p. 76, 6evs for Oeos). Also on page 85 "quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus" .... becomes "unique"; and on page 78 Leibniz' Thgodicge is written Theodicea. DOROTHY M. EMMET</page></plain_text>
