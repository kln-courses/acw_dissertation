THE within geographical its area a diffusion large proportion of totemism of the is non-Aryan so wide,. including races of within its area a large proportion of the non-Aryan races of the world, and with regard to ancient nations it " may be regarded as certain for the Egyptians, and highly probable for the Semites, Greeks, and Latins,"1 that the possibility of it being found among the survivals of archaic custom in Britain might almost be taken for granted. Mr. Grant Allen2 and Mr. Lang3 have pointed out some of the evidence by which it may be inferred that totemism existed among the tribes who conquered Britain, and the opinion of two such distinguished authorities must be duly considered. Still I would venture to affirm that the systematic examination of the subject has not yet been attempted. The evidence has been almost wholly confined to that obtainable from the patronymic names of the early Anglo-Saxon settlers and their local distribution, " precisely like what results in America, Africa, and Austrália, from the totemistic organisation." The evidence of folk-lore has not been brought forward, and, granting all that Mr. Lang and Mr. Allen have said, it only proves that the totem organisation, though surviving as a name-system, was at its very last stage of existence, and did not pass forward into the peasant-life of the nation after the tribes had settled down - did not, that is, assume anything like the same proportion of influence on the higher civilisation that followed it which, as Mr. McLennan has proved, existed among the nations of antiquity.4 At present it is certainly open to the opponents of the theory, like Canon Isaac Taylor and Mr. See- 1 Frazeťs Totemism, 91-95; cf.

An examination of the evidence of folk- lore, however, will, I think, add so much to the evidence brought forward by Mr. Lang and Mr. Allen that all opposition to the suggestion that relics of totemism are to be found in Britain must cease. But I will add one caution at this point. We must not too hastily conclude that these surviving relics can be traced either to the Teutonic or Celtic branches of the Aryan family who occupied this country. There are two methods of investigation into this subject : first, that actually adopted with so much success by Professor Robert- son Smith in his examination of the survivals of totemism among the Semitic races ; and secondly, that suggested by the exhaustive analysis of totemism with which Mr. J. G. Frazer has enriched anthropological knowledge. The former lays down rules for detecting totemistic principles in a people which has long advanced beyond the totemistic stage of development ; the latter investigates living totemistic organisations, and enables us to form a code of rules for ourselves, by which we may be guided in detecting sur- vivals of the totemistic organisation. Of these two methods the latter would necessarily be the more scientific, because it would be obtained by a strictly inductive process, while the former was con- structed for the immediate purpose of the author, and though no doubt upon inductive principles, yet the process of construction is not made known. One other difference between these two methods of investigation I am desirous of pointing out, namely, that the first is somewhat elastic in its demands for details of evidence, while the second is exacting in its production of type-forms of totemistic beliefs, and thus enables us to trace out shades of de- parture from the type-form in the survivals in modern custom. I have been thus careful to state the distinctions between these two methods of investigation, because I am anxious to emphasize the significance of the very first example of totemism in Britain which I shall produce. I shall set down Professor Robertson Smith's formula, and I shall test the British evidence by this standard, with the result, I think, of showing that the British example far exceeds in the perfection of its details the standard which was sufficient to trace out, and I think adequately, the survivals of totemism among the Semitic races of Arabia. We</page><page sequence="3">Totemism in Britain . 219 therefore start off with this fact, that the British evidence is more perfect than the Arabian. Mr. Robertson Smith's conditions are as follows: "(1) The existence of stocks named after plants and animals" - such stocks, it is necessary to add, being scattered through many local tribes ; " (2) the prevalence of the conception that the members of the stock are of the blood of the eponym animal, or are sprung from a plant of the species chosen as totem ; (3) the ascription to the totem of a sacred character which may result in its being regarded as the god of the stock, but at any rate makes it be regarded with veneration, so that, for example, a totem-animal is not used as ordinary food. If we can find all these things together in the same tribe, the proof of totemism is complete ; but even when this cannot be done, the proof may be morally complete if all the three marks of totemism are found well developed within the same race. In many cases, however, we can hardly expect to find all the marks of totemism in its primitive form ; the totem, for example, may have become first an animal god, and then an anthropomorphic god, with animal attributes or associations merely."1 The British example of a totem-stock which I am anxious to test by this standard occurs in Ireland. It was noted by Mr. G. H. Kinahan in his researches for Irish folk-lore, and is mentioned quite incidentally among other items, the collector himself not fully perceiving the importance of his " find". This really enhances the value of the evidence, because it destroys any possibility of an -ob- jection to its validity - a really important matter, considering the remarkable character of this survival of totem-stocks in Western Europe. The exact words of Mr, Kinahan are as follows : - "In very ancient times some of the clan Coneely, one of the early septs of the county, were changed by ť art magick' into seals ; since then no Coneely can kill a seal without afterwards having bad luck. Seals are called Coneelys, and on this account many of the name changed it to Connolly."2 The same local tradition is mentioned by Hardiman in one of his notes to O'Flaherty's De- scription of West or H-iar Connaught ,3 but the note is equally sig- 1 Kinship and Marriage in Arabia, , p. 188. 2 Folk- Lore Journal ' ii, 259; Folk-Lore Record ' iv, 104. Miss Fennell kindly informed me at the meeting of the Folk-Lore Society, where I read this paper, that she had frequently heard the islanders of Achill, off the coast of Ireland, state their belief that they were descended from seals. 3 Irish Archœological Society , p. 27 ; there is a Seal Island off the coast of Donegal, Joyce, Irish Place-Names , ii, 282 ; and some Shetland legends of the seal will be found in Soc, Antiq . Scot., i, 86-89. R 2</page><page sequence="4">220 The Archœological Review . nificant of its genuineness from the fact that the tradition is styled " a ridiculous story". It strengthens Mr. Kinahan's note in the following passage : - " In some places the story has its believers, who would no more kill a seal, or eat of a slaughtered one than they would of a human Coneely." Another mention of the same tradition is probably noted by a writer in the Gentleman! s Magazine , who, describing a mythical creature called the " merrow", half fish and half woman says: " Some allegory is probably concealed under the fiction of certain families on the coast of Ireland being descended from these marine creatures."1 If this be compared with the formula laid down by Professor Robertson Smith for a complete proof of totemism, it will be found that it supplies (i) the existence of a stock named after an animal - the Coneelys after a seal ; (2) the conception that the members of the stock are of the blood of the eponym animal - the clan being changed into seals is the form of the survival of a descent from seals ; (3) the ascription to the totem of a sacred character, so that a totem-animal is regarded with veneration, and is not used as ordinary food - no Coneely can kill or eat of a seal without afterwards having bad luck. There is absolutely nothing wanting, then, in the identification of this piece of Irish folk-lore with the totem-system of early society; and if we can add to this any evidence of the wide distribution of the clan Coneely, we should have all the con- ditions of existence under which primitive totem-clans group them- selves. The clan is mentioned both by Mr. Kinahan and by Mr. Hardiman as one of the oldest Irish septs ; and that it is widely spread, and not congregated into one locality, is to be inferred from the description of the tradition as prevalent in Connaught, especially from Mr. Hardiman's words, describing that " in some places" the story has its believers now, so that wherever the clan Coneely are situated there would exist this totem-belief - a fact proving its archaic origin in one remarkable particular, namely, that it is a tribal, not a local, cult. Starting from this exceedingly perfect example of an Irish totem-tribe, we may with confidence attempt to reconstruct from the relics of an older life enshrined in folk-lore some of the less perfect examples of totemism. We have it in evidence that at least one clan, widely distributed throughout a certain district of Ireland, was named from a totem-animal, looked upon that animal as sacred, and believed themselves identified with it. If we cannot adduce any other examples of clans with the same beliefs and 1 Gomme's Gentleman 's Mag . Library , Traditions , 14.</page><page sequence="5">Totemism in Britain . 221 associations, we may turn to the local successors of the clans, and see whether in the records telling us of the early history of these clans, or in folk-lore now attached to a particular locality, there are not some relics of totemism. Locality now has taken the place of kinship and common descent, and it is to local centres that we must of necessity turn. The most remarkable local survival of a totem-tribe is to be found in Ossory. Giraldus Cambrensis tells an extraordinary legend to the following effect. " A priest benighted in a wood on the borders of Meath was confronted by a wolf, who after some preliminary explanations gave this account of himself : There are two of us, a man and a woman, natives of Ossory, who through the curse of one Natalis, saint and abbot, are compelled every seven years to put off the human form and depart from the dwellings of men. Quitting entirely the human form, we assume that of wolves. At the end of the seven years, if they chance to survive, two others being substituted in their places, they return to their country and their former shape.1'1 Here is a saintly legend introduced to explain the current tradition of the men of Ossory, that they periodically turned into wolves. Fynes Moryson, in 1603, ridiculed the beliefs of "some Irish who will be believed as men of credit", that men in Ossory were " yearly turned into wolves".2 But an ancient Irish MS. puts the matter much more clearly by the statement that the "descendants of the wolf are in Ossory";3 while the evidence of Spenser and Camden explains the popular beliefs upon exactly the same lines. Spenser says, " that some of the Irish doe use to make the wolf their gossip'*';4 and Camden adds that they term them " Chari Christi, praying for them and wishing them well, and having contracted this intimacy, professed to have no fear from their four-footed allies". Aubrey adds that " in Ireland they value the fang-tooth of an wolfe, which they set in silver and gold as we doe ye Coralls";5 and Camden notes the similar use of a bit of wolfs skin.6 1 Topography of Ireland, lib. ii, cap. 19. 2 Hist, of Ireland, ii, 361. 3 Irish Nennius , p. 205 ; Lang's Custom and Myth, p. 265. 4 View of the State of Ireland, p. 99. The significance of the word " gossip' is worth noting. Halliwell says it " signified a relation or sponsor in baptism, all of whom were to each other and to the parents God-sibs , that is, sib, or related by means of religion." This meaning does not seem to have died out in the days of Spenser, and his use of the word to describe the relationship ot the men of Ossory to wolves is very significant. For the history of this im- portant word, see Hearn's Aryan Household , 290. 5 Aubrey's Remaines of Gentilisme , 204. 0 Camden, iii, 455 ; iv, 459.</page><page sequence="6">222 The Archœological Review . In the local superstitions of Ossory, therefore, we have two of the cardinal features of savage totemism, as in the example of the clan Coneely - (2) the descent from the totem-animal ; (3) the ascrip- tion to the totem of a sacred character and the belief in its protec- tion.1 It is not to be supposed that among the relics of prehistoric life which folk-lore has preserved that many such examples as these could be forthcoming. Characteristics of a totem-tribe, whether in its tribal or local form, must of course have become scattered under the crushing influence of a thousand years of civilising powers. We may rest satisfied that from folk-lore we have been able to produce types of totem organisation, first in the clan form, and secondly in the local form, which meet more than the require- ments for proving them to be survivals from primitive totemism, and we may now turn to Mr. Frazer as a guide for detecting the more scattered remnants of totem beliefs and customs. Mr. Frazer has adopted the same method of investigation practically as that adopted by Mr. J. F. McLennan in his papers on the worship of animals and plants in the Fortnightly Review of 1869-70. The formula which may be extracted from Mr. Frazer's review of the beliefs and customs incidental to the totemistic organisation of savage tribes, appears to me to properly fall into the following groups : - (а) Descent from the totem. (б) Restrictions against injuring the totem. (¿) Restrictions against using the totem for food. (1 d ) The petting and preservation of totems. ( è ) The mourning for and burying of totems. (/) Penalties for non-respect of totem. ( g ) Assistance by the totem to his kin. ( h ) Assumption of totem-marks. (/) Assumption of totem-dress. (J) Assumption of totem-names. ( 'k ) Local cults derived from totemism. My suggestion is that if we can classify under these heads any- thing like a reasonable proportion of the superstitions and customs attaching to animals and plants, and preserved to us under the title of folk-lore, we may fairly conclude that the origin of such super- stitions and customs must be sought for in a primitive system of totemism which once prevailed among the tribes occupying these 1 The dislike to killing wolves in Ireland is expressly mentioned by Fynes Moryson, H ist of Ireland^ ii, 367, and they were not extirpated until the last century.</page><page sequence="7">Totemism in Britain. 223 islands. The clan Coneely and the Ossory wolves are proofs that such a system existed, and if such perfect survivals have been able to descend to modern times, in spite of the influences of civilisation, there is no primâ facie reason why the beliefs and customs inci- dental to such a system should not have survived, even though they are no longer to be identified with special clans. When once a primitive belief or custom becomes separated from its original surroundings, it would be liable to chang'e. Thus, when the wolf clan of Ossory passes into a local cultus, we meet with the belief that human beings may be transformed into animal forms, as the derivative from the totem-belief in descent from the wolf. For- tunately, the process by which this change took place is discernible in the Ossory example ; but it will not be so in other examples, and we may therefore take the transitional form supplied by the Ossory example as a key to the origin of similar beliefs elsewhere. Again, if we endeavour to discover how the associated totem-beliefs of the clan Coneely would appear in folk-lore supposing they had been scattered by the influences of civilisation, we can see that at the various places where members of the clan had resided for some time would be preserved fragments of the once perfect totem- belief. Thus, one place would retain traditions about a fabulous animal who could change into human form ; another place would preserve beliefs about it being unlucky to kill a seal (or some other animal specially connected with the locality) ; another place would preserve a superstitious regard for the seal (or some other local animal) as an augury ; and thus the process of transference of beliefs into folk-lore, from one form into other related forms, from one par- ticular object connected with the clan to several objects connected with the localities, would go on from time to time, until the diffi- culty of tracing the original of the scattered beliefs and customs would be well-nigh insurmountable. But having once proved the existence of such examples as the clan Coneely and the Ossory wolves, this difficulty, though still great, is very much lessened. Our method would be as follows. We first of all establish that totem-clans did actually exist in ancient Britain, or whence such extraordinary survivals? We next examine and classify the beliefs and customs which are incidental to totemism in savage society, and having set these forth by the aid of Mr. Frazer's admirable study on the subject, we ascertain the parallels to these beliefs and customs in the folk-lore of Britain. And then our position seems to be very clearly defined. We prove that in folk-lore certain customs and superstitions are identical, or nearly so, with the beliefs and customs</page><page sequence="8">2 24 The Archceological Review . of totemism among savage tribes, and wel conclude that this identity in form proves an identity in origin, and therefore that this section of folk-lore originated from the totemistic tribes of early Britain. In further proof of this conclusion, it is to be noted that no class of custom or superstition thus identified with totemism stands abso- lutely alone, but that the totem-objects belonging to one class reappear in other classes, each reappearance of the totem object in a different class, thus strengthening its claim to be considered one of the broken fragments in folk-lore of a once perfect system of totem belief and custom. To show this result as clearly as possible, after collecting the various items of folk-lore under the various heads of totem beliefs and customs, these being obtained, be it remembered, from Mr. Frazer's examination of. existing totem- tribes, I proceed to tabulate the totem-objects under each head, and number them. This number I retain as a constant index of the totem-object throughout these researches, and by this process we obtain information as to the different phases of totemism which each object has retained in folk-lore, and so we may judge whether the argument used in support of the theory of a survival of totem-beliefs in Britain is arrived at from sufficient evidence, because it is in the nature of our research that the fragments of folk-lore collected under each heading derive their full force as evidence of totem-beliefs from their cumulative value ; if we find a totem-object under one heading only, it may have got there from accidental causes ; if we find the totem-object repeated under several headings, it must have got there from some cause common to all these phases of belief, and until some other cause is brought forward, it appears to me that totem beliefs afford the only ex- planation of the phenomena. Before commencing this tabulation of the totem-objects in Britain, it would be well to note the totems of primitive tribes. Thus we have the opossum, emu, swan, duck, fish, waterfowl tribes, among the Australians ; the wolf, bear, beaver, turtle, deer, snipe, heron, hawk, crane, duck, loon, turkey, musk-rat, sable, pike, catfish, sturgeon, carp, buffalo, elk, reindeer, eagle, hare, rabbit, snake, reed, grass, sand, water, rock, tobacco-plant, tortoise, red maize, the wind, tiger, bird, root, birch-rind, thickwood, sheep, brushwood, moose- deer, cat, trout, leaves, crow, sun, and snow, among the American Indians.1 The tabulation of the totem-objects begins with the two type- cases which we have just dealt with, and we have thus (i) The seal. (2) The wolf. 1 McLennan, in Fortnightly Review , xii, 410,- 413.</page><page sequence="9">Totemism in Britain . 225 (a) Descent from Totem . This, perhaps, is the most difficult, as it is the most important, section of totem-beliefs. It is easy to understand that it should have given way before the march of Christianity, but this does not prevent us discovering relics of it. Thus we have an example in Conaire, an Irish chieftain, who is said to have been the son of à bird. That this is a true totemistic descent is proved by the addition to the legend of the food tabu, from which we learn that, before his death, Conaire's father (the bird) told the woman, his mother, that the child must never eat the flesh of fowls.1 The ancient name of Long Island was Innis Cat, the island of the cat or catey, and this is still traced among the people, who in common with the Cat Taobh, Cat Side, in Sutherlandshire, the Cat Nis of Caithness, and the clan Chattan, are called the descendants of the cat or catey, and have a cat for their crest.2 In the case of the wolves of Ossory, the local survival of a clan-totem, it has been pointed out that the belief of totem-descent from an animal passed into the belief of a change from human into animal forms, and Mr. McLennan has dealt with this as a phase of totemistic beliefs.3 Among the superstitions of Clunie, in Perth- shire, which are recorded as dying out in 1793, it is mentioned that cats, hares, and magpies were believed to be able to transform themselves into human shape.4 Analogous to this are the beliefs of human beings being able to turn themselves into animals. The well-known superstition of witches taking the shape of hares, cats, etc., is an example, the significance of which I must point out later on. In the Isle of Man, the annual custom of hunting the wren is accounted for by a legend which is closely connected with this phase of belief. In former times, it is said a fairy of uncommon beauty exerted such undue influence over the male population, that she at various times seduced numbers to follow her footsteps, till by degrees she led them to the sea, where they perished. A certain knight laid a plot for her destruction, which she only escaped by taking the form of a wren, but though she escaped in this way, a spell was cast upon her, by which every New Year's Day she must assume the same form of a wren, and ultimately perish by a human hand.5 1 Lang's Custom and Myth¡ 265. 2 Repori of the Crofter Commission, 1884, p. 451 ě 3 Fortnightly Review , xii, 424. 4 Statistical Account of Scotland^ ix, 253. 6 Bullock's Hist of the Isle of M an^ 18 16, p. 371.</page><page sequence="10">226 The Archœological Review . This legend leads up to those beliefs wherein the souls of dying human beings take the shape of birds or animals. Butter- flies, in the parish of Ballymoyer, Ireland, are said to be the souls of your grandfather.1 In Yorkshire the country people call night- flying white moths, " souls".2 Mr. Kelly, in his Curiosities of Indo-European Folk-lore , relates a curious story which he heard from a Londoner, by which it appears that a sparrow was believed to be the soul of a deceased person.3 In Nidderdale the country people say that the Nightjar embody the souls of unbaptised infants.4 In county Mayo it is believed that the souls of virgins remark- able for the purity of their lives were after death enshrined in the form of swans.5 In Cornwall the fisherfolk believe that they can sometimes see their drowning comrades take the form of animals,6 which is remarkable from the fact that it seems an entirely inde- pendent belief, and not due to the watery grave which awaited the victims. In the same county it is believed that King Arthur is still living in the form of a raven, changed into that shape by magic, and that some day hę will resume his kingly form again.7 An Irish saint-legend relating to St. Brendan is distinctly totemistic in origin. The saint had some oxen grazing in a field which belonged to a chieftain named Dobharchu, i.e., an otter, who killed the saint's oxen. Thereupon St. Brendan prayed that the chief might be transformed into a real otter, after his name. Afterwards the chief went to take a drink in the lake, when he fell in, and was imme- diately transformed into an otter. Dobharchu's son afterwards came fishing in the lake, but was cautioned against this practice by his father.8 The descendants of Dobharchu are still called by the otter name thus gained by the eponymous chief, and they lived near Ennis, in Thombnd.9 As a far-off echo of the once-existing belief of the actual re- lationship of man to animals, as exemplified in totemism, this group of superstitious fancy seems to be very perfect. Even if we admit that the identification of the soul with the flying moth is a poetical 1 Mason's Stat.

It remains to tabulate these collected instances of the belief of a descent from the animal world, and we find as our second list of totem-objects the following, namely : (3) Fowl. (4) Cat. (5) Hare. (6) Magpie. (7) Butterfly and moth.2 (8) Sparrow. (9) Nightjar. (10) Swan.3 (11) Wrën. (12) Raven. (13) Otter. (b) Restrictions against injuring the Totem . Mr. Frazer says that if the totem is an animal, its kindred will not (i) kill it ; in some cases will not touch it or even (ii) look at it ; (iii) will not speak of it by its proper name, but use descriptive epithets instead ; if the totem is a plant, its kindred will not (iv) gather it under certain circumstances, and at a- particular period of the year, and (v) will not use the wood for fire. These four totem restrictions are found surviving in folk-lore, and I will give examples of eachģ (i) At Baschurch, in Shropshire, it is unlucky to kill a bat.4 In the west of Ireland it is unlucky to kill a magpie,5 also in north- east Scotland.6 In South Northamptonshire " the robin is con- sidered a sacred bird ; to kill one is little less than sacrilege."7 The same superstition obtains in the West of Scotland, where to kill or hurt it is a sin.8 In Lancashire it must not be killed.9 In the west of Scotland it is unlucky to kill the dark brown or spotted butterfly.10 In north-east Scotland it was unlucky to shoot a cat, and it was believed that if anyone did so, he would within a short time meet with a disaster of some kind.11 In Hampshire it is un- 1 Teutonic Mythology (Eng.

The Chaddagh fishermen in Galway would not go out to fish if they saw a fox ; their rivals of a neighbouring village, not believing in the fox, do all they can to introduce a fox into the Chaddagh village.6 These people are peculiar in many respects, and are distinctively clannish. They retain their old clan-dress - blue cloaks and red petticoats - which distinguishes them from the rest of the county of Galway, and it may be conjectured that the present-day custom of naming from the names of fish - thus, Jack the hake, Bill the cod, Joe the eel, Pat the trout, Mat the turbot, etc.7 - may be a remnant of the mental attitude of the folk towards totemism. In the Midland counties and Yorkshire it is bad luck to meet a white horse unless you spit at it.8 (iii) For the prohibition of naming the totem-object we must turn to Scotland. In north-east Scotland the word hare is not pronounced at sea.9 In several villages, Mr. Gregor notes, the men existence of the cat clan, e.gů% the clan Chattan, it seems perfectly intelligible, as the superstitions surviving after the cat clan had ceased to be considered or to consider themselves as identified with their totem. 1 Folk-lore Journal , i, 394. 2 Ibid.) ii, 258. 3 Harland and Wilkinson's Lancashire Folk-lore , 142. 4 Swainson's Folk-lore of Birds, 53. 6 Elton's Origins of English History , 297 ; Sikes' British Goblins , 162. 6 Folk-lore Record , iv, 98. The Ulster Journ . Arch ii, 164, mentions the "hare" as being unpropitious. 7 Ulster Journ. Archaeology , 11, 161, 162. It is pointed out on p. 166 of this suggestive account of the Chaddagh fishermen, that the -growth of their stringent clannishness is due to their being organised into a craft - the whole village being fishérfolk ; and it is scarcely necessary to suggest how closely this agrees with the Hindu caste. For the archaic origin of such trade villages as Chaddagh, see Hearn's Aryan Household, ' 241. 8 Burne's Shropshire Folk-lore^ 208; Henderson's Folk-lore, 116. 0 Gregor, Folk-lore , 129.</page><page sequence="13">Totemism in Britain. 229 would not pronounce the word swine when they were at sea1 ; also the word salmon was never pronounced ; if there was any occasion to speak of it, a circumlocution was used, and it was often named after the tax-man of the fishings nearest the village whose inhabitants shunned pronouncing the name of the fish. Thus it would be called " so-and-so's fish"š Sometimes it was called " the beast". In some of the villages along the north-east of Scotland it went by the name of " the Spey codlin".2 In another passage Mr. Gregor puts the matter still more significantly for the point of view we are studying. He says : " When at sea the words ' swine', ł salmon', ' trouť, ' dog', and certain family-names were never pro- nounced by the inhabitants of some of the villages ; each village having an aversion to one or more of the words."3 And in another passage he tells us the real name of the green crab was never pro- nounced, especially at the time of putting it on the hook as bait.4 (iv) On plants as totems there is much of interest in English folk-lore ; but I will first turn to a remark of Sir Alfred Lyall in his interesting study of the religion of the Indian province of Berar. He says that " there are several thickets and clumps of trees in Berar from which no stick is ever cut, nor even the dead wood picked up, though firewood is scarce and timber valuable" ; and also that " in Berar different families are said to pay exclusive honour to certain kinds of trees". He goes on to compare with these certain well-known tree-superstitions in England, and par- ticularly to note that "the maypole and the mistletoe are supposed to be relics of early Keltic tree-worship". " But in England", he says, "the pedigree of these customs is dim, dubious, and disputable ; the Church has for ages been denouncing and stamping out the ancient indigenous superstitions, whereas in India the aboriginal autocthonic ideas of the country-folk have been subjected to no persecution by dominant faiths."5 I will not stop , to insist upon the evident totemistic origin of the Berar family-worship of par- ticular trees,6 but it is certainly of some importance to note that, though technically Sir Alfred Lyall's observation is undoubtedly true, there are some remnants of the old cult still left. Thus Mr. Friend notes, though without stating his authority, that until quite 1 Gregor, Folk-lore , 129. 2 Ibid., 146 ; Antiquary , xvi. 3 Ibid., 199. 4 Ibid., 148. 6 Lyall's Asiatic Studies, p. 12. 6 On the connection between belief in the descent from a tree and the objection to injure trees, see Keary, Outlines of Primitive Belief, 65, and cf.

Other phases are to be met with in Scottish or Irish superstition. At Ardclinis, in county Antrim, there are strong prejudices against removing old thorn-trees, and one man " declared solemnly that he has seen some hundreds of the ( wee-folk' dancing round these trees, who told him he should suffer for meddling with them."2 Strip this of its essentially local surroundings, as in folk-lore we are bound to do, and it forms an exact counterpart of the Berar family-custom. We may also take a passage from Aubrey, which places the protection of trees upon a purely totemistic basis. Noting that " in the parish of Ockley some graves have rose-trees planted at the head and feet", he goes on to note the opinion of a Mrs. Smyth, that "they planted a tree or a flower on the grave of their friend, and they thought the soule of the party deceased went into the tree or plant."3 About a century ago there stood a row of trees, " all of equall size thick, planted for about the length of a butt", near the chapel of St. Ninian, in the parish of Beely, then "looked upon by the superstitious Papists as sacred trees, from which they reckon it sacrilege to take so much .as a branch or any of the fruit." The same venera- tion was entertained in the Isle of Skye, where, about two hundred years ago, a sanctified lake is described as being surrounded by a fair wood, which none presumed to cut, and those who ventured to infringe this superstitious protection, either sickened at the moment, or were visited afterwards by some signal inconvenience, even if sundering the smallest branch.4 A quick-thorn in the parish of Monedie was held in such veneration that people ab- stained from lopping any portion of it, and affirmed with awe that they who ventured to do so were punished for their sacrilege.6 A V Friend's Flowers and Flower Lore , i, 39.

A branch falling from an oak, the Edgewell tree, standing near Dálhousie Castle, portended mortality to the family.3 A quotation from Carew's History of Cornwall also gives us an example of this phase of belief : " In Probus parish, in the late park of Lanhadron, there groweth an oak bearing his leaves speckled with white, as doth another called Painters oak in the hundred of East ; but whether the former partake any supernatural property to foretoken the owner's soon-ensuing death when his leaves are all of one colour (as I have heard some report) let those affirm who better know it ; certain it is that divers ancient families in England are admonished by such predictions."4 A comparison of this group of totem-beliefs with the first group shows us, first, a recurrence of the following totem-objects already noted : (4) Cat. (5) Hare. (6) Magpie. (7) Butterfly. And secondly, the introduction of the following fresh totem- objects for the first time in this second group : (11) Bat. (12) Robin. (13) Cuckoo. (14) Dog.6 (15) Swallow. (16) Fox. (17) Horse.6 (18) Swine.7 (19) Salmon. (20) Trees.8 (c) Restrictions against using the Totem for Food. The well-known passage in Caesar (lib. V, cap. xii), from which we learn that the Britons were forbidden to eat the hare, the cock, or the goose, is the most direct early authority upon restrictions against certain kinds of foods. Mr. Elton, with this passage in his mind, notices that "there were certain restrictions among the 1 Statistical Account of Scotland, xv, 255. 2 Folk-lore Record, , v, 169 ; cf. Gomme's Gent . Mas'.

Britons and ancient Irish, by which particular nations or tribes were forbidden to kill or eat certain kinds of animals" ; and goes on to suggest that " it seems reasonable to connect the rule of abstaining from certain kinds of food with the superstitious belief that the tribes were descended from the animals from which their names and crests or badges were derived."1 I have already cited an instance where an Irish chief, descended from a fowl, was interdicted from eating its flesh; Of Cuciilain, another celebrated Irish chieftain, whose name means the hound of Culain, it is said that he might not eat of the flesh of the dog, and he came by his ruin after transgressing this totemistic tabu.2 Mr. Frazer points out (19) that even among existing totem- tribes the respect for the totem has lessened or disappeared, and among the results of this he notes instances where, if anyone kills his totem, he apologises to the animal. Under such an interpretation as this, we may surely classify a " memorandum" made by Bishop White-Kennett about the hare, the first of the British totems mentioned by Caesar : " When one keepes a hare alive and feedeth him till he have occasion to eat him, if he telles before he kills him that he will doe so, the hare will thereupon be found dead, having killed himself."3 Mr. Elton has noted both the classical and modern accounts of certain districts in Scotland and Ireland where fish, though abun- dant, is tabooedaas food, and he quotes with approval a mo'dern sug- gestion that this abstinence was a religious observance.4 I will proceed to notice other food taboos. At Great Crosby, in Lancashire, there is held an annual fes- tival which is called the " Goose Fair", and although it is accom- panied by great feasting, the singular fact remains that the goose itself, in whose honour the feast seems to have been held, is con- sidered too sacred to eat, and is never touched by the villagers.5 Early in the seventeenth century there was a deep-rooted aver- sion against eating swine in Scotland.6 A prejudice also existed against white cows in Scotland, and Dalyell ventures upon the acute supposition that this was on account of the unlawfulness of 1 Origins of English History , 297. 2 Proc .

The tabulation under this group gives us, first, the recurrence of the following totem objects : (3) Fowl [i.e., cock]. (5) Hare. (14) Dog. (18) Swine. (19) Fish. and the introduction of the following new totems for the first time under the food-taboo : (21) Goose.3 (22) Cow.4 I must here interpose a remark with reference to these last two sections of evidence. Apart from the significance of the super- stitions as they have been recorded in their bare condition among the peasantry, there is the additional fact to note that the super- stitions against killing certain animals or birds, or against looking at them or naming them, etc., is not universal. They obtain in one place and not in another. If they were simply the reflection of a universal practice not to kill, injure, or eat a certain animal, such a practice might originate in some attribute of the animal itself which characteristically would produce or tend to produce superstition. But the spread of this class of superstition in certain districts and not in others, is indicative of an ancient origin, and it is exactly what might be expected to have been produced from totem-clansģ Unfortunately, neither the negative evidence of super- stitious beliefs nor the local distribution of superstitious beliefs has ever been considered worthy of attention. But some little evidence is incidentally forthcoming, and I would submit that this may be taken as indicative of what might be obtained more fully by further research into this neglected aspect of folk-lore. I drew Miss Burne's attention to this subject, and she has noted some par- ticulars in her valuable Shropshire Folk-lore . Thus, of the super- 1 Daly ell's Darker Superstitions of Scotland, ' 431. It should be noted that Dalyell wrote before the age of scientific folk-lore, and therefore his observa- tions are founded more upon conjectures derived from the practices and beliefs themselves than from any theory as to origins. 2 Gomme's Gentleinarìs Magazine Library , Pop .

S</page><page sequence="18">234 The Archœological Review . stitions against killing or meeting certain animals, we have noted those connected with the bat at Baschurch, and the white horse in the Midland counties. At Newport, Pulverbatch, Church Stretton, and Worthen, so far from being unlucky, it is considered lucky to kill the bat1 ; in North Shropshire it is lucky to meet the white horse.2 Now, it is singular that this division corresponds with the boundary line of races which Miss Burne has so admirably depicted on her map. Again, we have noted the unluck attending any injury done to a swallow, but the same bird is viewed with dislike in Ireland, in Caithness, and in Norfolk f and as to the butterfly, which we have seen is protected in Scotland, in Cornwall " they always chase and try to kill the first butterfly of the season, and should they succeed, they will overcome their enemies".4 If we compare the statement of Caesar, that after a battle the Gauls sacrificed " whatever captured animals survived the conflict",5 with this last-mentioned rather remarkable reason for the practice of killing the butterfly, and with the Chaddagh fisher-custom of forcing the fox upon the villages who considered it unlucky to meet this animal, it seems to me we have examples of what might be called the warfare of totemism. Among savages it is a great thing to capture the totem-gods of enemies, and to kill them before a battle. The corresponding survival of this state of primitive totem- beliefs in modern folk-lore would be fairly represented by the local distributions which I have pointed out. With reference to the goose, a known food-taboo amongst the Britons, and the hare and hen, it is most significant that modern folk-lore still represents a survival of the ancient state of belief with regard to these animals. But Colonel Forbes Leslie has collected several examples of the sacrifice of these animals among the superstitious practices of modern ages6 which we can reconcile with the older practice, either by the reaction which must have resulted from the forcible introduction of Christianity, whereby former totem-gods were sacrificed to the new supreme God,7 or by the practice of sacri- 1 Burne's Shropshire Folk-lore^ 214. 2 Ibid., 208. 3 Swainson's Folk-lore of Birds. 54. 4 Folk-lore Journal , v, 214. 5 De Bello Gallico , vi, 17. 6 Early Races of Scotland , i, 86-90. 7 A parallelo this suggested transition from totem- worship'to totem-sacrifice is supplied by the Karen hill tribes of India, of whom it is reported, that there are " different rites hereditary in different families of the same, or of different, tribes" as to the offerings to departed ancestors. " One set offer only rice and vegetables, another offers fowls, another hogs, another oxen or buffalo," and so on, as sacrifices to their ancestors. Journ . As . Soc . Bengal , xxxiv (2), 205.</page><page sequence="19">Totemism in Britain. 235 ficing or killing the totem-gods of enemies. Both these sections however, afford evidence of that intermixture of totem-objects which is to be expected from the known facts of totem-beliefs and customs, and, indeed, Mr. McLennan has laid it down that " we might expect that while here and there perhaps a tribe might appear with a single animal god, as a general rule tribes and nations should have as many animal and vegetable gods as there were distinct stocks in the population .... we should not expect to find the same animal dominant in all quarters, or worshipped even everywhere within the same nation."1 (ď) The Petting and Preservation of Totems. Mr. Frazer illustrates the customs of rearing and petting the totem-animals or plants from the example of the Australian snake- clan, who catch snakes and rear them as pets ; the Samoan pigeon- clan, who carefully keep and feed pigeons ; the Javanese dog-clan, with whom each family rears one of these animals, and so on. In noting the examples of this practice in modern folk-lore, of course we must steer clear of the ordinary domestic animals, al- though from the peculiar sanctity of the pancake it is possible we may connect with this phase of totem-practice the custom at Ollerton in Northamptonshire, where the first piece of the first pancake on Shrove Tuesday is given to the cock.2 But we may pass from this to more certain parallels of primitive totemism. The raven was a sacred bird of the Druids, and O'Curry has preserved from an early MS. source that it was domesticated for the express purpose of the auguries obtained from its croaking.3 In parts of Pembrokeshire, on Twelfth Day, a wren is secured in a small house made of wood, with doors and windows. Pieces of ribbon of various colours are fixed to the ridge of the roof outside. This wren-house is then carried round the village, and visits are made to the principal houses, their arrival being announced by the Song of the Wren , as follows : " Joy, health, love, and peace Be to you in this place ; By your leave we will sing Concerning our king ; 1 Fortnightly Review , xii, 562. a Folk-lore Record , 11, 213. It is also worth noting that it was a general practice to " throw at cocks" on Shrove Tuesday instead of, as at Ollerton, giving them food of a special nature. 3 O'Curry's Manners and Customs of Ancient Irish , ii, 224. S 2</page><page sequence="20">236 The Archaeological Review. Our king is well drest In silks of the best ; With his ribbons so rare No king can compare ; In his coach he doth ride With a great deal of pride, And with four footmen To wait upon him ; We were four at watch, And all night of a match, And with powder and ball We fired at his hall. We have travelled many miles Over hedges and stiles To find you this king Which we now to you bring. Now Christmas is past, Twelfth Day is the last, Th' old year bids adieu, Great joy to the New."1 It is clear at all events from the song that the ceremony of electing the wren as king has altered as time has progressed, and we can, I think, restore this custom to its place as a survival from a totem-practice. In Ireland, on St. Stephen's Day, the practice is to carry the bird about by the leg in the centre of two hoops crossing each other at right angles, and a procession is made of men, women, and children singing an Irish catch, importing him to be the king of all birds.2 These modern customs must, however, be considered side by side with what O'Curry has preserved from an early MS. source that the chirping of wrens was used as an augury of the Druid cult, and that the bird was domesticated for the express purpose of the augury.3 These facts about the wren make up altogether tolerably certain evidence of its connection with primitive totemism. Turning to other objects we have first the fact that the common white butterfly was a favourite in the West of Scotland, and to catch one and preserve it alive, feeding it with sugar, was considered lucky,4 a folk-lore substitute for an 1 Swainson's Folk-lore of British Birdsi 36-43 ; Notes and Queries , 3rd Ser., v, 109 ; cf.

There is strong evidence from the old trials for witchcraft that toads were in some places baptised for magical purposes, kept, fed, and decorated with ribands.1 But perhaps the best example of this section of totem- belief and practice comes from Scotland. In a well near the church of Kilmore in Lorn, during the course of the seventeenth century, there were kept some mystical or sanctified fish. These are described as having been two, black, never augmenting in size or number, nor exhibiting any alteration of colour, according to the testimony of the most aged persons. The inhabitants are said to have called the "said fishes Easgseant, that is to say, holie fishes"? It is important to note that the conception of these holy fishes never changing, is distinctly of primitive origin, just as we have it in tree-worship in India, where the facts of nature will not alter the natives' belief that sacred trees neither die nor grow.3 The tabulation shows the recurrence in this section of the following totems : (3) Fowl [/.£., cock]. (7) Butterfly. (19) Salmon [/.£., fish]. And the introduction of the following new totems : (23) Raven.4 (24) Wren. (25) Toads. (e) The Mourning for and Burying of Totems . The dead totem, says Mr. Frazer, is mourned for and buried like a dead clansman, and he supplies examples from Samoa, East Africa, Arabia, California, and also from two Greek centres, namely, Athens and Seriphos, an island in the iEgeanģ This seems to be the origin of the curious custom once obtaining at Biddenham, on the 22nd September, when a little procession of villagers carried a white Vabbit decorated with scarlet ribbons through the village, singing a hymn in honour of St. Agatha. All the young unmarried women who chanced to meet the procession extended the first two fingers of the left hand pointing towards the rabbit, at the same time repeating the following doggerel : 1 Daly ell' s Darker Superstitions of Scotland ' 407. 2 Dalyell, loc . cit., 412. 3 See Fergusson's Tree and Serpent Worship , 74. 4 On the raven as a totem, see Frazer, loc . cit.y 5.</page><page sequence="22">238 The Archaeological Review . " Gustin Gustin lacks a bier, Maidens, maidens, bury him here."1 At Burford, in Oxfordshire, they make a dragon yearly and carry it up and down the town in great jollity on Midsummer Eve.2 When a wren was killed on Christmas Day, in the Isle of Man, it was laid on a bier with great solemnity, carried to the parish church and buried, after singing dirges, called its knell, over it in the Manx language. This being concluded, Christmas commenced.3 The tabulation of this section repeats the following totems : (5) Hare [tš.e., rabbit]. (24) Wren, and introduces us to (26) Dragon. (/) Penalties for Non-respect of Totem. One of the special instances mentioned by Mr. Frazer (16) is that of the Bakalai tribe, who think that if a man were to eat his totem, the women of his clan would miscarry and give birth to animals of the totem kind. I have not been able to identify any direct parallel to this totem belief, unless it be in the prevalent idea in North Ireland and North-east Scotland, that pregnant women, if frightened by a hare, will have a child with a hare lip.4 In our tabulation system this repeats the following totem : (5) Hare. {ģ) Assistance by the Totem to his Kin. Mr. Frazer shows that the savage " totem gives his clansman important information by means of omens",5 and among the examples he quotes is one from Samoa, with whom, " if an owl flew before the owl clan as they marched to war, it was a signal to go on ; but if it flew across their path or backwards, it was a sign to retreat ; some kept a tame owl on purpose to give omens 1 Folk -lore Record, ' i, 243. A considerable correspondence upon this custom has been printed in the Standard newspaper, from April 17th to May 2nd, the vicar of Biddenham endeavouring to prove that such a custom never existed. It has, however, the support of one eye witness and the record of an old inhabitant, Captain Robe. 2 Plot's Natural History of Oxfordshire , 349. 3 Waldron's Isle of Man, 155 ; Dalyell's Darker Superstitions of Scotland, 421 ; Train's History of the Isle of Man. ii, 124-7. 4 .

Observing that we have already fixed upon the hare as a totem-animal of the ancient British, let us compare with the Samoan custom the statement about Boadicea when she faced the Roman army. She took from her bosom a hare, which she released, and a favourable augury being deduced by the Britons from the course in which the animal started, the queen ordered her army to attack the Romans.1 In modern folk-lore we have the curious example from South Northamptonshire that " the running of a hare along the street or mainway of ą village portends fire to some house in the immediate vicinity."2 In Scotland there is evidence of a peculiar custom of rearing a horse's head in the fields, and Dalyell very appropriately compares this with the mention in the Sagas of a northern chief who elevated a horse's head on a pole in the course of his execrations against the King and Queen of Norway, and with the Scandinavian practice of stripping it of the skin, and elevating it before an enemy, to in- timidate him, conjoining verses that the army might 1&gt;e speedily destroyed.3 In Connaught the white otter is never killed but with the loss of . man or dog, and its skin is a preservative against danger in battle, victory always remaining with the wearer.4 Alcuin, writing to Charlemagne in 735, reproaches the British with paying attention to auguries drawn from the flight and cries of birds. Many of these auguries are still extant as items of popular belief. . In South Northamptonshire, to see a crow flying alone is a token of bad luck.5 In North-east Scotland it is deemed lucky in some villages and unlucky in others to see a magpie.6 In Lancashire it is unlucky to see this bird, and when it is seen it is customary to raise the hat in salutation, sign the cross on the breast, or make the sign by crossing the thumbs and then spitting over them.7 In Devonshire a peacock screaming forebodes death.8 In Scotland the yellow-hammer is considered mystical, and in Orkney the presence of the lark, called " our lady's hen", was deemed auspicious.9 The redbreast is also lucky in Scotland, -the wren unlucky.10 Totems assist their clansmen by acting as doctors ; one of the 1 [Xiphiline, Mon.

In Weardale, Durham, to cure worms a trout is obtained and placed alive upon the bowels of the patient.1 At Shieldaig, in Ross-shire, an otter's bladder has been in the possession of a game- keeper for a number of years, and is used in the neighbourhood as a cure for illness.2 In North-east Scotland, when a family had to remove from one house to another, the cat was always taken, and before a member of the family entered the new abode, the cat was thrown into it, and if a curse or disease had been left on the house, the cat became the victim, and died, thus saving the family's lives.8 A fox's head was nailed on the stable door in some parts of Scotland to bar the entrance of witches.4 Hardwicke has preserved a curious Lancashire legend connected with the " Dun cow", which is of itself a distinctly totem-legend, and has its variant in India among the non- Aryan aborigines.5 The Lancashire legend is con- nected with the old farm called the Old Rib in the township of Whittingham, the name of which is derived from an extraordinary rib which was taken from an old dun cow and placed over the door of the farmhouse.6 Amulets descending from father to son in particular families, and borrowed by people in the neighbourhood for the purposes for which they are considered useful, are certainly survivals of totemism. One of these is said to have been for a long time preserved in the family of Campbell of Glenlyon. It is rather of an ovoidal form, about iļ inch in diameter, the outside a polished surface, and its whole interior exceedingly pellucid, pure, and free from flaws. Another amulet, much of the same description, is preserved in the 1 Folk-lore Record, ' ii, 205. 2 Ibid.) iv, 183 ; Folk-lore Journal , i. 124. 3 Gregor, Folk-lore , 124. 4 Dalyell, Darker Superstitions of Scotland, ' 148. Among the Ainos of Japan, the aboriginal race, the skulls of bears are hung up opposite to each house, and the skulls of foxes are preserved inside the house. This exhibition of the skulls takes place with certain ceremonies, among which is a drink- offering presented to them on special occasions. They show an idolatrous veneration for these skulls. Journ.

Another, the celebrated Lee Penny belonged to the Lockharts, lairds of Leyis House, in East Lothian.1 An image of wood about two feet high, carved and painted like a woman, is kept by one of the family of the O'Herlebys (Ballyvorney, county Cork'), and " when anyone is sick of the small- pox they send for it, sacrifice a sheep to it, and wrap the skin about the sick person, and the family eat the sheep. But this idol, hath now much lost its reputation, because two of the O'Herlebys died lately of the small-pox."2 That ordinary omens of assistance should pass into acts of worship for assistance is an easily accounted for transition. Pen- nant, in his Tour in Scotland ,3 gives a curious account of a ceremony practised by herdsmen. They formed a square trench, leaving the turf in the middle. They next lighted a fire and cooked a dish composed of eggs, butter, oatmeal, and milk. They had also oat- meal cakes on which they raised nine square knobs. The cere- monies then began by spilling, as a libation, some of the dish prepared with eggs and milk. Each of the knobs on the cakes was dedicated to some particular being, the supposed protector of their flocks and herds, or to some particular animal, the real destroyer of them. Each person, turning his face to the fire, broke off a knob from his cake and flinging it over his shoulder, said, " This I give to thee, preserve thou my horses"-" This I give to thee, preserve thou my sheep", and so on. After that, they used the same ceremonies to the noxious animals, saying, " This I give to thee, O fox, spare thou my lambs" - " This I give to thee, O hooded crow" - " This to thee, O eagle", etc. The appearance of the totem in or about the house was by some clans regarded as an omen of death ; the totem had come to fetch his kinsman (Fraser, 23). At Pulverbalch, in Shropshire, it is accounted unlucky to bring a bat into the house.4 In the north of Ireland a magpie tapping at the window is a sign of death in the house.5 In South Northamptonshire, " before the death of a person a robin is believed to tap thrice at the window of the room in which he or she may be."6 In Lancashire a jackdaw is always 1 Dalyell's Darker Superstitions, 157.

A white dove is thought to be a favourable omen ; its presence betokens recovery to the persons within.1 In Wiltshire a sparrow tapping at the window indicates a death in the family.2 Rooks are believed to forsake their home upon the downfall of the family, or the death of the heir, to whom the estate belongs ; and instances are quoted from Northumberland, Rutlandshire, and Cornwall3; and a phantom bird is supposed to appear at the death of a member of the Oxenham family.4 Taken altogether, this section seems to afford very conclusive evidence of survival of totem-beliefs.
