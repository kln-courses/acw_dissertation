Vous aurez à enseigner l'histoire. Alors, sachez-le, Jeanne d'Arc, c'est sacré, celui qui touche à Jeanne d'Arc est un salaud.1 From the time of the Revolution of 1789 to the beginning of the Fifth Republic, the French were able to accommodate to relatively abrupt changes of regime in part because there was a broad agreement about the nature of French national identity. Disagreements about the legitimacy of the actual political system were compensated by widely shared memories and myths about the origins and historical experiences of the French people. These myths were once so powerful that the descendants of immigrants to the French Politics &amp; Society, Vol. 8, No. 1, Winter 1990</page><page sequence="2">William Safran Hexagon tended to accept and internalize them, and even Blacks and Jews did not feel too uncomfortable in speaking about "our ancestors the Gauls." To be sure, there is a Jacobin tradition according to which French national identity has been defined, not in organic, but in functional terms - that is, on the basis not of descent, but of commitment to common political values. One of the best-known approaches to a value- or contract-based definition of the French nation was that of Ernest Renan, who said in Qu'est-ce quune nation? (in 1882): Une nation est une âme, un principe spirituel. Deux choses qui, à vrai dire, n'en font qu'une, constituent cette âme, ce principe spirituel. L'une est dans le passé, l'autre dans le présent. L'une est la possession en commun d'une riche legs de souvenirs; l'autre est le consentement mutuel, le désir de vivre ensemble, la volonté de continuer à faire valoir l'héritage qu'on a reçu indivis. Concern with national identity has been greater among the French than among the British or Americans. For the French, such identity could not be based merely on political formulas, since these formulas and the regimes that embodied them were, as Hippolyte Taine once remarked, "overturned and remodeled every twenty years." Nevertheless, it is clear that the French nation did not come to an end whenever these values were put aside under empires, restored monarchies, or authoritarian regimes. For there was a common religion, a common culture, and a (more or less) common language that united most of the inhabitants of France. Even republican historians such as Michelet emphasized the importance of these commonalities. Once upon a time, the French nation was defined in terms of Latin Christianity; later it came by turns to be defined in terms of the French language, republican principles, and a universal civilizing mission (a theme elaborated repeatedly by Fernand Braudel2). Still, as Le Bras and Todd have pointed out, the diversity of the French people - their folkways, patterns of speech, family orientations, cuisine, and religious practice - was such that the French nation became unthinkable without the French state.3 A major instrument of that state was the centralized public school system, which was 57</page><page sequence="3">French Politics &amp; Society so effective that the children of immigrants as well as indigenous peripheral minorities were transformed into French men and women, and the French melting pot (le creuset) was regarded as a model for democratic nation- building.4 Pierre Chaunu agrees with Le Bras and Todd in concentrating on the melange of peoples that have inhabited France and in arguing that the French, in search of unity, have found an emphasis on history indispens- able. But whereas Chaunu views France in an almost anthropomorphic sense - as a "person" who suffers, remembers, and hopes,5 and points to the (organic) continuity of generations - for him, the fact that "France contains 15 billion graves and only some 50 million living souls" is an important element of French identity6 - Le Bras and Todd point to the ideological- political aspect of that continuity: that of the "identical universal man [and] of the revolutionary dream that did not die with the First Republic."7 National unity and identity were enforced by the political system, in which "from top to bottom, from right to left of the Hexagon, one rubber-stamps the same papers and passes the same exams."8 Chaunu argues that the history of France - including even its organic aspects - was defined by the state; as he put it, "France has loved 'Gaul' only since the last century: Gaul is an invention of the collèges and of the Revolution."9 However, all these assumptions and identitive underpinnings have been undermined by relatively recent changes. Catholicism (apart from the fact that it has not been specifically French but universal) has been displaced by secular political culture; republican principles are now so widespread that France no longer possesses a monopoly in this regard; the French people's claims to a superior political morality were put in question by the collabora- tionist behavior of many of its citizens during World War II and the excesses of colonialism; and the French language and culture have been threatened with a progressive '"corruption" - if not displacement - by a global, and heavily American-flavored, mass culture. Finally, the functionality and sanctity of the state are increasingly undermined by three developments: decentralization; the institutionalization of supranationalism (in the context of the European Community); and a (now fashionable) skepticism about the excessive claims of the state. 58</page><page sequence="4">William Safran In a sense, it was now possible to desacralize the state because of a growing consensus about the regime. In the eyes of many observers, the shaping of such a consensus, the increasing acceptance of pluralistic (or polyarchic) institutional relationships, and an ever widening area of agreement on public policies - developments that have been discussed during the past few years in numerous colloquia - have signified the end of French exceptionalism. That consensus had apparently become solid enough that the "state" could be deemphasized and the French could pay greater attention to "civil society." However, the texture of that society has become so complex and pluralistic that it has generated a debate about the very identity of the French nation, a debate reflected in a steady output of introspective writings on the relation- ship between society as a whole and its component parts. The attempt to rediscover or recreate subnational identities had received a particular impetus with the rebellions of 1968, which were marked by a search for smaller communities in which individuals could at once feel more autonomous and more participant. Since that period, new terminologies have entered the sociopolitical discourse, most of them indicative of an increasing tolerance for the idea of a plural society in France: e.g., ethnie-ethnicité; communauté-identité communautaire ; and minorité-conscience minoritaire (minoritude).10 Both indigenous and territorially based minorities, e.g., Alsatians, Basques, Bretons, Catalans, and immigrant and territorially scattered minorities began to insist on a pluralistic definition of French nationhood, under which one might be simultaneously a member of the French nation and of an ethnic subcommunity, i.e., politically and even culturally French but subpolitically and subculturally something else as well. Much of this debate has been sparked by the presence of between two and three million North African Arab (i.e., Maghrebi) immigrants, which has caused resentment among the indigenous working class that believes itself to be threatened with unemployment, and with which these immigrants tend to compete for jobs, housing, and social benefits. The presence of these immigrants has posed a challenge to the assimilation machinery of France because of their religion, their non-European provenance, their "exotic" cultural heritage, their physiognomy, their social customs, and the continuing connections of many of them with their countries of origin. 59</page><page sequence="5">French Politics &amp; Society The National Front and other extreme-right movements have reacted to this situation by taking obstinate (and pessimistic) refuge in an ascriptive- organic approach to membership in the French national community. At the other extreme are the optimistic cultural pluralists. Some of them, like Robert Lafont and Christian Coulon, consider France to be an artificial creation - a "nation-destroying" state based on a sort of internal colonialism.11 Others, among them Henri Giordan, Paul Oriol, and Jean- Pierre Colin, believe that French national identity can coexist comfortably with a variety of subnational identities - e.g., Breton, Occitan, Armenian, Arab, and Jewish; that the continued maintenance of the particularistic cultures associated with these identities would make French society more interesting and French culture more creative; that the "national" culture of the French majority is strong enough to safeguard its superordinate position; that (as Colin asserts) the pluralistic approach to national identity is a matter of principle; and that the acceptance of ethnocultural diversity in France not only corresponds to the historical reality of France but is intrinsically a good thing because it is in accord with the basic liberty of cultural choices. Moreover, as Oriol argues (pp. 118-125), these particularisms do not threaten political or even national unity, any more than do economic, generational, or gender-based diversities or, for that matter, the presence of Protestants and Jews or the existence of two compet- ing school systems - the public and the private - as long as the nation is defined in a flexible and tolerant way. All that is necessary is to devise the proper administrative and policy structures under which the multiple, and peaceably coexisting, ethnocultural identities of subcommunities would be disjoined from a strictly political French identity, which would be shared by all. Related to this pluralistic vision of French society is the notion that (political) citizenship can be separated from (ethnically or culturally defined) nationality , such that the two are no longer dependent on one another.12 Several of these views are embodied in L'Identité française , a collection based on a colloquium organized by Socialists. The various contributors share a belief in a heterogeneous French society whose nature is constantly evolving, a society that should be generous vis-à-vis minorities, tolerant of differences, and open to multiple influences; and all share an interest in redefining Frenchness in a sense that would make it less exclusivist and less an expression of idolatry toward a mythic notion of "I'hexagonie" The problem with a redefinition of French identity away from the organic is that 60</page><page sequence="6">William Safran it would presuppose a push toward a more étati st vision, i.e., to an identity defined essentially by the state. The "social-democratic" approach seems to reject both the étati st and the organic notions of identity and to locate it somewhere in the middle: it conceives of a society as an evolving mosaic of subgroups whose existence is legitimate, and in which, as Elisabeth Badinter put it (pp. 24-25), one is " Français ď abord mais pas Français seulement ," and where the right to be different is expressed in multiple identities whose existence is not equated with double political loyalties. This approach (which has contained no specific policy recommendations) has been widely criticized by both right-wing and left-wing Jacobins - i.e., by both orthodox Gaullists and many equality-oriented Socialists - who have contended that it signifies a dualism that interferes in the direct relationship between the citizen and the national sovereign and is destructive of individual liberty. They have also argued that it smacks of a romanticized image of American plural society and that it ignores the intimate connection between the political system and culture that has traditionally prevailed in France. A representative view is that of Dominique Schnapper, who insists on the continuing relevance of the Jacobin definition of national identity. As Schnapper asks rhetorically, "Who among us has Gauls for ancestors?" Frenchness is founded not on biology but on acts of will and adherence to a culture: "One is French by virtue of a language, the internalization of a culture, and the will to participate in economic and political life."13 It was the Jacobin definition that made possible the francisation of German, Polish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants. The emphasis on the genetic rather than the existential ethnicity of members of minorities was echoed in the following remarks by President Mitterrand at the Sorbonne: "We are French [and] our ancestors [were] Gauls - [and] Romans, and a little German, a little Jewish, a little Italian, a little Spanish, increasingly Portuguese . . . and I ask myself if we are already a little Arab [as well]."14 To defenders of ethnic pluralism, such remarks, however well intended, embody a patronizing view of minority cultures - as minor components that dissolve into a larger culture, or into a socialist utopia that is as mythical as the notion of a common ancestry embraced by the Right.15 Such remarks also suggest a portrayal of the absorptive capacity of French society that appears somewhat idealized in view of the past difficulties of French- speaking (and French-thinking) Protestants and Jews, and the current 61</page><page sequence="7">French Politics &amp; Society difficulties of French-speaking Maghrebis and Blacks, in being accepted as fully constitutive parts of the French nation. In any case, the Socialists' inclusive approach to the French nation is reflected in the thinking of the Comité des sages on French nationality, whose recommendations, embodied in the Rapport Long , rejected the organic approach to nation in favor of an "elective" one (vol. 2, pp. 88-89). The Rapport Long also rejected the pluricultural basis of French identity - and thus stands in stark contrast to the Rapport Giordan , whose recommen- dations were to furnish the basis for a set of official policies that signified a pluricultural definition of the French nation.16 The Rapport Long argues that the encouragement of multiple cultural identities, although generous in intention, is inadvisable not so much because it would legitimate supple- mentary cultures or introduce confusion among minorities, but because it would lead to discrimination. This argument is based on the (not always clearly articulated) conviction that cultural identity cannot be divided without a division of political identity. In turn, this conviction flows from the belief that national culture is shaped, if not totally created, by the state and thus cannot be separated from politics. Some Gaullists would publicly agree with such a view. Michel Hannoun, a former Gaullist deputy and his party's specialist on immigrants, shares Schnapper's optimistic convictions about the continuing efficacy of the French melting pot; in his two books, Hannoun argues for a multiracial French society but against a multicultural one.17 Michel Debré, too, accepts the melting pot; but although he does not specifically reject a multiracial France, his orthodox étati st views have led him to reject pluralistic cultural and institutional policies, because both have the effect of destroying the congruence between nation and state.18 The position of the Club de l'Horloge reflects an ascriptive view of French national identity; but it is presented in partly Jacobin functionalist terms that contain a thinly veiled racism. To some of the contributors of L'Identité de la France , the nation is synonymous in the first place with the state and would therefore include all who are under the authority of the state (p. 63). Secondly, the nation comprises all who participate in the political process. Thirdly, there are a number of specific determinants of membership such as language, culture, and the sharing of a desire to live together (p. 64). 62</page><page sequence="8">William Safran Elsewhere in the volume, however, it is asserted that the Maghrebis and other minorities should not be considered French merely by virtue of resid- ing in France or even speaking its national language. " Etre Français ça se mérite ": one must prove one's entitlement to membership in the French nation by adopting its political beliefs, obeying its laws, and serving in its army. Harlem Désir points out in his book (p. 180) that 81 percent of young Franco- Algerians choose to wear the French (rather than the Algerian) uniform and that the vast majority of young Maghrebi women have shaken off the old role-constricting traditions of their mothers. But to the contribu- tors of the book by the Club de l'Horloge that is not enough. They argue that the Maghrebis' background and cultural-religious conditioning have been such that they are not easily capable of assimilating French values. They may speak French, but in view of their Muslim religion they do not fit into a nation based on "Judeo-Christian" principles. (Curiously, Jews are now considered French by important segments of the respectable right wing.) At the same time, because Islam is more than a religion, they are thought incapable of accepting French political and social values, such as republicanism, institutional pluralism, gender equality, and laïcité . Consequently, the Maghrebi presence, far from contributing to an expanded definition of national identity, establishes a "counter-identity" in the country ( Identité de la France , pp. 205, 222). These fears were echoed, albeit without racist overtones, by the authors of the Rapport Long , for whom "it [seemed] inconceivable that one part of the population bases itself on another [system of] law[s], in the name of cultural relativism" (vol. 1, p. 27). Most recently, this kind of argument has been revived in connection with the problems encountered by the public schools in shaping the lay national identity of girl pupils who cover their heads with veils and scarves in class.19 The quest for what has been called "la révalorisation des identités minoritaires " (La France au pluriel ?, p. 31) is a reaction to such exclusivist sentiments; it is a symptom of the difficulty faced by members of minori- ties in constructing a personal identity that takes into account both their own cultural-psychological backgrounds and the practical need to adapt to the majority culture. Albert Bastenier, a contributor to the book by Abou- Sada and Milet, which is largely devoted to variations on the theme of double identity, argues that such an identity is forced upon minorities by the majority and therefore constitutes a reaction to the lack of acceptance of these minorities by the host society (pp. 79-90). Intellectuals and politicians 63</page><page sequence="9">French Politics &amp; Society who belong to that society, including nonxenophobic Socialists, no longer accept the paleo-Marxist notion that ethnic minority consciousness is a false one that will (or should) be eclipsed by class consciousness; they do, how- ever, tend to think that the quest for an upgrading (or even for a symbolic official legitimation) of minority identities is indicative of ingratitude, of a lack of realism, and of confusion. Ingratitude, because to many members of the French elite an interest in the maintenance of minority cultures smacks of a failure to acknowledge the net gain for the minorities that results from a relinquishing of an inferior culture in favor of a superior one; lack of realism, because the maintenance of such a culture blocks social and economic integration and upward mobility; confusion, because many, and perhaps most, of those who insist on the retention of an ethnic subidentity are unable to state clearly what they mean by it. Thus for some Bretons, bretonnité is a way of looking at reality, a style of family life, and a down-to-earth outlook worth preserving; for others, the effort to preserve the richness of Breton culture would be difficult in the face of both economic modernization and the Parisian cultural steamroller, and would be too late and therefore useless;20 and still others hope for a revival of the Breton language, aided by the national government. For some Occitans, the culture of the Langue d'Oc was a preindustrial and regionally specific one, and French culture was a complement or supplement to Provençal culture; for others, French culture is a superordinate and perhaps superior culture, and for still others, a domineering and "enemy" culture (La France au pluriel ?, p. 20). For the Jews who search for a supplementary identity there is the problem of several competing definitions of Jewishness, all of them problematic in the French context. The purely cultic approach of the Israélites (in vogue since the time of Napoleon) has become ever more irrelevant in a lay civilization, to which most French Jews are committed, while the ethnocommunitarian one of the Juifs is resented by many non- Jews as exclusivist and particularistic and as alien to French traditions (ibid., p. 90 ff.). Some Maghrebis - found especially in la France-Plus - emphasize "la droit à la difference " (Aïssou, p. 192 and passim); others - especially the activists in SOS Racisme - believe in a " droit à la ressemblance ," and point to the failure of the host society to integrate the Maghrebis economically and make them part of the French nation. For some, dualism means the per- petuation of the Islamic faith and practice and of the Arabic language and culture in France; for others, it signals the development of a unique Franco- 64</page><page sequence="10">William Safran Maghrebi culture and literature. An increasing number of Beur intellectuals seem to be adopting a middle position: favoring a progressive economic and political integration of Maghrebis into French society, but at the same time advocating a public policy that would promote the teaching of Arabic as one of the languages of a large component of the French nation (Aïssou, pp. 50- 54, 200 ff.). This position, which implies a pluralistic definition of the French nation, is supported by Jacques Berque, a Marxist scholar of Islam.21 It is interesting to note that many intellectuals of ethnic minority backgrounds are themselves, in terms of their cultural literacy and their day- to-day behavior, French rather than Beur, Breton, Jewish, or Occitan; but they may promote the idea of arabité, bretonnité, judéité, or occitanisme in order to propagate an ideal-type of French plural society. These ambiguities are exploited by cultural Jacobins, who insist on a uni- form French culture. Unfortunately, such a culture refers to an ideal-type as well. There are those who argue that in view of the increasing penetration of international, if not American, culture into France, it is no longer possible to speak of an undiluted French national culture. Jacobins admit that the culture on which national identity is based is not static but that it evolves and adapts to internal needs and external influences. But they argue that nowadays the pressures are much more intense than they were previously and involve cultural contributions that tend to undermine the French nation- state not merely as defined in the traditional sense but also in the functional one - i.e., as exemplified in a unique approach to republicanism, equality, and social relations. There are others, however, who assert that the dangers of further penetration make even more urgent the effort at preserving a unitary or monistic view of culture and nation. There are French scholars who have raised doubts whether membership in a national community is the most important element in the public identity of individuals; Gilles Verbunt, for example, speaks of a number of rival identities - regional, familial, professional, religious, ideological, and functional - and wonders whether the attempts to subsume them under the rubric of the French nation have succeeded (or should succeed).22 Such questions are likely to be posed more insistently with the further development of transnational patterns, especially after 1992. The Europeanization of economic relations, the harmonization of policies, the 65</page><page sequence="11">French Politics &amp; Society diffusion of curricula, the equivalence of school diplomas, the freer move- ment of peoples across state boundaries, the cross-fertilization of national cultures, and the mixing of languages - all these must contribute to the growth of a supranational consciousness as a result of which a more careful definition of French national identity will be even more necessary than it was in the past, but also more difficult.
