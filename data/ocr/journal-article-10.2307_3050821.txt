<plain_text><page sequence="1">A MEDIAEVAL BRONZE PECTORAL CROSS Contributions to the Study of the Iconography of the Holy Trinity and of the Cross BY W. L. HILDBURGH THE cross shown in Figs. I and 2 is, so far as my knowledge goes, unique amongst surviving mediaeval objects. Although nothing definite appears to be known as to its history before it came into the hands of a certain Parisian dealer in antiquities, he had an idea that it had been obtained, not long before he bought it, from somewhere in or near Lorraine. We shall see that the ascription thus suggested appears to be confirmed by a number of similarities between the cross and some few other objects with which it may usefully be compared. The dimensions (height 5- in., width 3 ,1 in.) and the means provided for its suspension suggest that it was made for use as a pectoral cross. In the back there is a large oblong cavity, partly produced by casting and partly by the subsequent use of tools, presumably intended (like the corre- sponding cavities in the backs of other mediaeval pectoral crosses) to contain a relic or relics, above which there was formerly riveted something which has now disappeared- probably, to judge by the amount of protrusion of the rivets still in place, a piece of leather or other stout and similarly destructible material. The object is formed of a golden bronze, deep in color and with a reddish tinge, and has been cast-cross and crucifix-in one piece, chased in parts, and heavily gilt. A number of holes, in addition to those for the rivets above mentioned, have been drilled near the edges. One series of these, so small as to suggest that they were made to take threads, seem, when looked at with the smooth back of the object, to indicate that at some period the cross was sewn upon a piece of leather or of cloth. Two larger holes at the top, and one at the bottom, suggest that the cross was for a time attached to a solid backing: the closed hand at the top leads us to suppose that this backing, whatever the form it may have had-I am unable to cite examples for comparison-did not extend beyond the upper edge of the cross. The closed hand, ending at the wrist, which projects from the top of the cross has a hole (which shows so little wear as to indicate that it was not much used) passing through it beneath the fingers. I think that this hand was meant to serve only as a utilitarian ornament, and, unlike all the other details of the object, was without religious significance. The cross itself, which is of a very unusual form, seems to represent, like many mediaeval crosses, the living Tree of Life, in accordance with a fairly common piece of symbolism first occurring long before the time at which the present object was made and persisting long after it.1 Although the cross, as a whole, is unlike any other with which I am i.

I FIG. 2 London, Victoria and Albert Museum (Loan): Bronze Pectoral Cross (Front and Back)</page><page sequence="3">80 THE ART BULLETIN acquainted, the edging of the front is very similar to that of the cross (the inner parts of whose surface are plain), shown in Fig. 3,2 in the Crucifixion panel of the great bronze doors of Hildesheim Cathedral,3 cast in Bishop Bernward's workshop in 1015. This is of especial interest to us because of the opinion4 that the art of Bishop Bernward's workshops appears to have been based mainly upon that of the district-Lorraine-whence our cross seems to have come. Like the crucifix of our cross, the Christ of the panel is shown without nails piercing either the hands or the feet; but the attitudes, the manners of representing the eyes, and the arrangements and the folds of the loin cloths, of the two figures, differ. In almost full relief against the cross, Christ appears as if crucified, with drooping head and (presumably) closed eyes,5 weight seemingly supported mainly from the hands, and feet side by side and turned as if held by a nail through each of them, although there are no nails in either the hands or the feet, following a convention' fairly common during the period to which the present cross is to be attributed, but more often associated with the inclusion of the suppedaneum than followed when, as here, that support is absent. Some- times the nails are lacking even from representations of the Crucifixion scene as a whole- in which we might reasonably expect to find displayed more realism than upon an altar cross or other cross intended primarily to serve as a symbol-as in the Hildesheim panel above referred to. The absence from our cross of any representation of means (such as nails) for attaching to it the crucifix or the Hand of God seems to show that we have not to do with any idea of symbolizing a crucifixion of the Blessed Trinity, even though there is evidence indicating the occasional occurrence of a belief that all Three Persons became incarnate,' instead of the Second Person alone. The nimbus, projecting from the cross, is circular and deepens toward its center, and it carries three wedge-shaped projections serving as arms of a cross; its form is not uncommon in German art of its time. Both the ribs and the navel of the crucifix are strongly marked. The loin cloth is unusual in arrange- ment, a portion of it being so turned over at the waist as to project forward and outward at either side, while another part hangs over the center; it covers the right knee and falls a little below it, but leaves the left knee bare. Against the upper part of the cross is our object's most curious feature; namely, a hand in the Latin gesture of benediction, but holding the body of a bird in such manner that the bird's head is on one side of the hand, its tail on the other, one wing over the wrist, and the other wing over the outstretched index and middle fingers. The hand obviously represents the Hand of God (and the grooved bar across its top probably a cloud, from which in other similar cases the Hand is generally shown emerging), symbolizing the First Person of the Trinity,8 so often shown in a similar situation on crosses of this period and somewhat 2.

And equally obviously, I think, the bird represents the Dove symbolical of the Holy Spirit.1' Thus, this cross exhibits to us a representation of the Blessed Trinity upon, presumably, the Tree of Life. A wreath or a crown, in combination with the Dextera Dei, is not uncommonly to be seen above the crucifix, sometimes held by, sometimes separated from, the Hand on other crosses of about the period of the present one. But it is rare to find the Dove so situated; and the holding of the bird, as upon our cross, is not paralleled upon any other cross known to me. In representations of the Baptism of Christ, some of them centuries earlier in date than our cross, the Dove, symbolizing the descending Holy Spirit, appears just above the head of the Saviour" and just below the Dextera Dei, being brought into that situation by the exigencies of the space available. It seems possible, therefore, that the rare examples showing both the Hand and the Dove above the crucifix on a cross may have been suggested to artists, otherwise unrelated to each other, by such representations of the Baptism. That the Dove of our cross has not, however, been used with a corresponding symbolism in view, seems to be indicated by its being depicted as if in horizontal flight. The few examples which I am able to bring forward of the showing of the Three Persons upon a cross appear to indicate-although with much less certainty than is desirable- that such showing was at the period in question a more or less local peculiarity, and not a widespread feature of mediaeval iconography. The most similar arrangement which I have found occurs on one of the pair of covers of the Psalter of Elisabeth of Hungary (the Salterio Elisabettiano) at Cividale del Friuli, in the plaque of hard black wood shown in Fig. 4.12 This plaque is set within a metal frame, which looks to be of later date,13 ornamented with scrolled foliage interspersed with small stars, and with six circles containing symbols of the evangelists, the Lamb of God, and a saint. The plaque is carved with a sort of symbolical Crucifixion scene. The Saviour stands in front of the cross (which extends from top to bottom and from side to side of the plaque) as if crucified, with arms outstretched, head inclined, and feet slightly apart and turned well outward; as in the case of our bronze cross there is no suppedaneum; and (so far as I have been able to judge from a careful examination of the photograph) neither hands nor feet appear as pierced.14 The photograph seems to indicate that the eyes are closed, as though the Saviour were dead.'5 The position of the thumbs, across the palm- 9.

Geistes (no. i of Formalikonographische Detail-untersuchungen, forming part XVIII of Zur Kunstgeschichte des Auslandes), Strasbourg, 1904. Ii. It may be noted, in passing, that winged creatures have an appropriate position above the head of Christ; it is perhaps partly because of this appositeness that on mediaeval crosses we find not infrequently the Pelican in her Piety, or a standing angel, above the crucifix, and- when the symbols of the evangelists appear-the eagle of St. John very often occupying the topmost place on the front or the back. 12.

This has been noted also by Swoboda.</page><page sequence="5">82 THE ART BULLETIN not, as in our bronze, parallel to the fingers-is a detail worthy of notice."6 A curious feature of the crucifix is drapery, seemingly an extension of the loin cloth, passing up the right side and across the back and hanging over the front of the left shoulder. Below Christ's feet kneels a figure of the Church, holding a chalice; and other chalices, beneath His hands, are held by the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, who are swinging censers above His shoulders." The presence here of the chalices seems to be entirely symbolic, for no blood is shown issuing from the (seemingly unpierced) hands or feet, or even from the wound in the side. Above the arms of the cross are the eagle (curiously, in the circumstances, in anthropomorphic form) of St. John and the man of St. Matthew, and below its arms are (in normal animal forms) the lion and the ox. The Saviour's loin cloth slopes, just as on our bronze cross, covering one (here the left) knee and leaving the other uncovered." Upon the cross, just above His head, appears the Dove, seemingly represented as stationary, although its head is upward and its wings outspread; and above the Dove is the Hand of God emerging from a cloud. St. Elisabeth's Psalter was written, probably at Reichenau,"9 for Bishop Egbert of Treves (977-993), a famous patron of the arts of his time, and its early pages20 show the monk Ruodprecht bringing it to him. It had a checkered history21 before it came into St. Elisabeth's hands, but since it seems always to have remained in the possession of a family closely associated with the rulers of Lorraine-Louis I. was appointed by Emperor Lothair II to be Landgrave of Thuringia, and it was through his great-grandson, Louis IV ("the Saint," 1217-27) that the psalter came by marriage to the Elisabeth from whom it takes its name-we may very reasonably presume that the Crucifixion plaque (whatever may have been the date at which it was carved, or the purpose for which it was made) is very probably also of Lotharingian origin. Another example of the representation of the Three Persons upon a cross occurs, engraved, on the front of the so-called Cross of Lothair, believed to have been made in the tenth century, now in the Cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle;22 see Fig. 5.23 As in the case of the panel described above, the cross here is a simple one, not one of living wood.

Reproduced from Cahier and Martin, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="6">A MEDIAEVAL BRONZE PECTORAL CROSS 83 figure of Christ is, as on both our bronze cross and the book-cover, placed in front of the cross without, seemingly, being fastened to it, for there are no nails through either hands or feet, although now we have blood represented as flowing from all four nail wounds as well as from the side. The feet are side by side, upon a suppedaneum. Above the head- uncrowned, as in the two previous examples-is a hand holding (in the ordinary way, with all the fingers round the object) a wreath; and within this wreath, but not in contact with it, stands a dove, shown in profile. As Cahier says,24 "l'artiste a voulu representer la Trinite tout entiere se reconciliant l'homme en Jesus-Christ, comme parle S. Paul [II Cor. v, 18, 19], et comme l'entendent surtout les Peres grecs en interpretant cette expression du grand ap6tre." There is, however, an important difference between this cross and the two crosses with which we have compared it, for whereas upon the latter the Hand and the Dove appear on the cross against which the Saviour stands, on the Cross of Lothair they are shown above, and distinctly separated from the corresponding cross-for the outlines of that cross, of T-form, are (like those of the crucifix, of the Hand, and of the Dove) engraved upon the large cross; that is, the Cross of Lothair, in so far as it enters into our argument, is essentially merely a vehicle which carries a cross with its Christ, a Hand, and a Dove, and might equally well have been of any other convenient form, instead of cross-shaped. Aix-la-Chapelle, where the Cross of Lothair was made, was not only in ancient Lotharingia, but was not far from Treves, for which St. Elisabeth's Psalter was written. In the Victoria and Albert museum there is a superaltar (no. io-i873), made during the first third of the twelfth century-before I13225-and presumably in the Hildesheim workshop, which is of considerable interest to us. It consists of a porphyry slab mounted in copper which has been engraved, darkened by treatment with linseed oil and heat, and gilt in parts.26 The central portion of the back (see Fig. 627) shows the Saviour standing, as if crucified, against a cross, His feet upon a suppedaneum and His arms upheld by God the Father, Whose head and shoulders appear, above the cross-bar, with, curiously, the upper limb of the cross outlined against His body, while His hands pass below that bar in order to hold the Son's arms. From the Father's mouth proceeds the Dove of the Holy Spirit, with head touching the head of Christ. Careful examination has seemed to show that no nail wounds are depicted in the Saviour's hands or feet, and certainly no flowing blood. Thus, we have here a representation of the Blessed Trinity upon the cross, differing essentially from that of our bronze pectoral cross only in that the cross is shown of squared wood instead of as a living tree (or of rough wood), and the First Person-of Whom but little more, I think it important to notice, than the head appears-in human form instead of symbolically. More than a century later in date, but interesting to us because of its resemblance to the representation of the Trinity just described, is a symbolical Crucifixion scene in an 24.

Immediately above the titulus appears the upper part of a figure of God the Father, shown on a scale only about one-half that of the crucifix, holding against His breast the Dove, the head of which is upward and touching His beard. In design, it is but a step from the representation of the Trinity on the Victoria and Albert Museum's superaltar to that on the champlev6 enamel superaltar of St. Maurice at Siegburg, attributed to Eilbertus, a monk of the Abbey of St. Pantaleon, at Cologne, about I135 (see Fig. 7).29 A panel of the upper surface of this shows, in reserve in an enameled ground, a Crucifixion scene-Christ upon the cross, between the Virgin Mary and St. John, and the sun and the moon-with a half-figure of God the Father within a large semicircle (corresponding to the one round Him on the Hildesheim superaltar) above the top of the cross (which, we may observe, with its crosspiece at its top, is of the same form as the Hildesheim cross). The cross is linked, across a band (bounding the lower edge of the semicircle) inscribed TRINITAS, with the figure of the Father by an ascending Dove30 of white enamel. There is, however, a much more important difference between the iconography of this superaltar and that of the Hildesheim example than that due to the placing of the First Person entirely above the cross and the Third only partly in contact with it, for now we have nails (or, at least, wounds) through the Saviour's hands, and blood pouring from His feet upon Adam rising in his tomb; and, further, the Blessed Virgin and St. John alongside the cross, and the inscription PASSIO. XP I below it. That is, what we now have is essentially a Crucifixion scene, with the Holy Spirit rising to the Father in Heaven, and only the contact of the Dove with both the Father and the cross, together with the word TRINITAS, to indicate to us that the artist intended particularly to symbolize the Trinity. Closely allied to the Hildesheim representation of the Trinity is a type of Trinity which seems to have come forward in the twelfth century-and quite possibly, I think, as a develop- ment from representations like that from Hildesheim-in which a large figure of the Father supports, by means of the cross which He holds, a much smaller figure of the Son, while the figure of a dove appears somewhere between the Father's mouth and the Son's head.

Probably somewhat earlier in date than the Oignies paten is the full-page miniature of which the upper part is reproduced34 in Fig. 8, attributed to a French artist of the late twelfth century or the early thirteenth, in a manuscript35 from the Abbey of Notre-Dame- aux-Nonnains and now (no. 2251) in the Municipal Library of Troyes; here the Dove is shown as if ascending from the Son to the Father, with head upward and touching the Father's chin, while its tail is within the Son's nimbus. This, if indeed of the date to which it appears attributable, is the earliest example known to me of its type. A further develop- ment of the same type, with the Father again shown in full, properly proportioned, but on a scale much larger than that of the Son, and holding a slender cross which, seemingly of T-form, appears to be touched by the head alone of the Dove, is shown in the tailpiece of this article and cover design of the magazine,"6 a drawing taken from a miniature in a French manuscript of the thirteenth century in the Bibliotheque Nationale. The type, sometimes with neither the crucifix nor the cross upheld by the Father's hands, became very common and widespread in the fourteenth century and the fifteenth, and a great number of extant examples dating from those centuries might easily be cited; the one shown in Fig. 9,37 on a fifteenth century English alabaster panel, will serve sufficiently to represent them. In all such Trinities it is the cross, with the Saviour nailed upon it, which (whether by the Father's hands or otherwise) is supported, and not, as on the Hildesheim superaltar, the living Christ. The line of development sketched above seems to me to be a logical one; and, if we may assume our dates to be approximately correct, in at least its earlier stages and for districts subject to Germanic influences, one highly probable.38 It has a peculiar interest, in that it displays, within the iconography of one particular subject-the Blessed Trinity 32. The paten is from the same hand as the chalice-- made and signed by Brother Hugo, of Oignies, who worked at Oignies up to about the end of the third decade of the thirteenth century-which it accompanies.

It has shown to us the First Person represented in the tenth century, and perhaps in the eleventh, on the Cross of Lothair, on the cover of St. Elisabeth's Psalter, and on our bronze pectoral cross, by His hand; in the early twelfth, on the Hildesheim superaltar, by but little more than His head; at about II35, on the Siegburg superaltar, by the upper half of His body; on the Oignies paten, of before the end of the third decade of the thirteenth century, by a small figure whose exaggeratedly large head recalled the earlier busts; in the Troyes miniature, presumably of the late twelfth century or the early thirteenth, by a figure on a scale somewhat larger than that of the Second Person; and in the miniature of the Bibliotheque Nationale's manuscript, of the end of the thirteenth century, a figure properly proportioned and on a scale much larger than that of the Second Person."3 Awe, and a disinclination to attempt to depict the Creator of All Things, may indeed have had some part in the devising of the earliest of these representations of the Trinity, and a gradual decline in the strength of those feelings have brought about the changes upon which we have looked, but there seems obviously to have been another, and far more important influence at work; as Didron puts it,40 "from the first ages of Christianity down to our own day, the esteem in which the Father is held, appears to have been progressively increasing." It would be interesting to try to trace, in liturgies, in ecclesiastical writings, in monastic chronicles, in the dedications of churches, and in records of other kinds, the evidence of this progressive increase during the period from about 950 to 1300, and to compare with what we may gather from those evidences what we seem to learn from the group of plastic and pictorial representations which have been cited above; but to do this would carry us far beyond the bounds of our present inquiry. There is, however, another line of development, sketched by MaLle in his L'art religieux du XIPe siecle en France,41 which might conceivably have given us the type of Trinity in question. He reproduces (op. cit., fig. 139) part of a window of Saint-Denis, dating from about 1145, depicting a large standing figure of God the Father holding before Him a cross (set in the chariot of "Aminadab" [Amminadib])42 upon which is placed a comparatively small figure of Christ. He cites next the Trinity window of Vend6me, made only a few years later than the Saint-Denis window, in which the chariot does not appear, but only the group of the Father and the Son. Next in his series is a miniature (see Fig. I2)4: in a Gospels in the Perpignan Library, whose illumination dates presumably from the second half, and most probably from the last quarter, of the twelfth century.44 In this miniature we may perceive the Father making a gesture of benediction, while in His left hand He holds a book; the cross, bearing a comparatively small crucifix, stands in front of Him, 39. This accords in its general lines, although not in its rough correlation of types with periods, with Didron's summary: "In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, God the Father, is no longer content to show merely an arm or a hand; he displays first his face, then the bust, and at length the entire person" (cf. Christian Iconography, vol. I, p. 2io; Hist. de Dieu, pp. 216 f.). 40. Christian Iconography, vol I, p. 221; Hist. de Dieu, p. 226. 41. Paris, 1922; cf. pp. 182 f. 42. Cant. vi, 12.

The Dove within and upon a circle held by the blessing Hand presents, in this miniature, a curious parallel to the Dove in the Dextera Dei of our little bronze cross. Perhaps but little later in date than this manuscript is the one in the Troyes Library, cited above (see Fig. 8), in which the Dove passes between the head of our Lord and the head of the Father. Presumably also a little later than the Perpignan miniature is a miniature in the Psalter of St. Elisabeth (cf. p. 82 supra), of which a portion is shown in Fig. 13.45 This miniature, which is an addition of about the end of the twelfth century to the manuscript prepared for Bishop Egbert, although similar to the miniature of Fig. io in that the Father holds the cross bearing the Saviour, differs in that here the Dove stands (with feet against the cross of the nimbus and with spreading wings) just above the Father's head, instead of passing between the Father and the Son. It is interesting to observe that, despite the alteration in the situation of the Dove, this miniature retains the vertically linear disposition of the Three Persons which appears in the book-cover (Fig. 4) accompanying it, the enamels (Figs. 6 and 7), the Cross of Lothair (Fig. 5), and our pectoral cross, all of which were actually or presumably made, broadly speaking, in the same district. One other early representation, also of the vertical type, of the Trinity containing the Crucified Christ, which seems to me to merit mention here is in a manuscript of the Royal Library at Vienna. It depicts God the Father seated, His right hand lifted in blessing, His left holding the book, with a broad cross of T-form before Him and rising to the height of His waist; upon this cross is a comparatively small crucifix, having the feet side by side, with the Dove (shown in profile and with closed wings) standing above the Saviour's head. The published drawing"4 suggests for this miniature a period approximating that of the Perpignan miniature.47 We have until now been discussing only representations of the Trinity in which the Second Person is shown crucified, and we have followed them, from what I take (see below) to be one of the earliest of such representations, up to the ordinary late mediaeval and subsequent type. There is, however, another form, also vertical in disposition, in which Christ is shown as blessing, not as crucified, which, I think, probably preceded the form appearing on our pectoral cross, and conceivably was a factor in the evolution of that form. A carved ivory book-cover, in the Meermanno-Westreenianum Museum, at The Hague, ascribed to the tenth century and tentatively to a Belgian source (perhaps Tournai) bears, within a circle, a half-figure of Christ holding before Him a large oval against which stands, with half-spread wings, the Dove, while round the upper part of His nimbus extends the Hand of God-with finger towards the right, thumb towards the left-emerging from clouds; across the circle, and as though behind our Lord's back, is a broad band, somewhat 45.

On crosses of this type He appears both triumphant and as a sacrifice; or even trebly symbolized, as on the sixth century "Cross of the Emperor Justin"49 preserved in the Vatican, which has at the top a bust of Christ Triumphant,50 the Lamb of God at the center, and Christ the Victim (holding a cross) near the bottom. The peculiar form of our bronze pectoral cross deserves more than the brief mention it has had above (p. 79). We there noted that the edging of the front of our cross resembles closely the edging of a cross (cf. Fig. 3) on one of the doors of Hildesheim Cathedral. Dibelius, speaking"' of this latter cross, says that it seems to represent the conventionalized trunks of palm trees; and, in substantiation of his claim, he cites the crosses on some of the Monza ampullae52 and several other examples of what seemed to him intended as representations of crosses made of palm wood unshaped by carpenters' tools. Attributing the origin of the cross forms on the Monza ampullae to a Palestinian craftsman's supposed natural impulse to show the cross of the Crucifixion as if made of a wood common in Palestine, he came (although acknowledging that those ampullae long antedate the earliest example53 known to him of a cross represented as if formed of a tree trunk with close-lopped branches) to the conclusion-of considerable iconographical importance, if verifiable- that in northern lands, where palm trees were unknown, representations of the scales or shoots of palm trunks were misinterpreted by copyists and became conventionalized into the familiar stumps of lopped branches. I am inclined, after examination of the Hildesheim door, to dissent from Dibelius's opinion that the cross on it has been intended to represent unshaped palm wood-or even, and perhaps more plausibly, living palm wood-because on other panels of the doors there are shown sprouts, of forms similar to the forms of those edging the cross, springing from tree stems which seem clearly not to be intended to represent palm trunks; the principal difference between these shoots-seemingly no more than conventionalized growing vegetation-and those of the cross is that the latter are regularly disposed and the former irregularly.54 Consequently, and even though the markings all over the front of our pectoral cross might be regarded as support for a belief that our cross represents palm wood, whether living (as the Tree of Life) or dead (as unshaped palm trunks formed into a 48.

The wavy lines on the cross in Fig. 14, and the general form of the overhang of the loin cloth are further likenesses between that cross and ours; but there are a number of differences-in the matter of the nail wounds (present in the one, absent from the other), in the positions of the feet, in the positions of the thumbs59 (parallel to the fingers in the bronze, at a wide angle in the painting), and in the general line of the lower edge of the loin cloth-which seem to indicate that there is no close relationship between the bronze cross and the painted one. There is, moreover, a certain difference between the two crosses which seems to me of the greatest importance for our present investigation; namely, that on the crossbar in the illumination the "sprouts" point all in the same direction, whereas on the crossbar of the bronze they point (outward from the stem) half to the left and half to the right. It should be observed that, were the attitude alone of the painted crucifix to be regarded, there might be some question as to whether its artist meant to portray the Saviour as triumphant or as a sacrifice, but that the eyes, indisputably depicted as closed, appear to be clear evidence that He is here represented as martyr-though whether as dying or as dead seems not clearly indicated by the associated details, for there is no blood at the nail wounds nor 55.

A colored lithograph of the panel, looking as if based on a photograph, is given on pl. 22 of vol. VI of The Antiquities of the Russian Empire, Moscow, 1853 (cf. vol. of [Russian] text, pp. 61-65). The evidence which has led Goldschmidt and Beenken to ascribe the doors to a Magdeburg crafts- man working about the middle of the twelfth century has not been accepted by all scholars as fully conclusive; there seems, however, to be general agreement as regards the doors as having been made after I150. 57. What I take to be a less plausible explanation may perhaps be found in the tradition, referred to below (p. 96) that the cross blossomed during the hours the Saviour hung upon it, and withered again when He died, for in this panel He appears without signs of His martyrdom. 58.

There can be no manner of doubt that the crucifix of Fig. 15 represents the dead Christ. And there can, I think, be but little doubt that the cross there, although richly covered with "sprouts," is represented as if of dead wood, and not as if it were the Tree of Life, for this is indicated not only by its lines, but by its colors-greyish with a slight tinge of blue, brownish, and (for lightening) yellow-as well;6" furthermore, the Sun and the Moon are shown in attitudes of mourning. I think, therefore, that we may reasonably suppose that the cross of Fig. 14, even though it has been drawn in green, also represents pieces of dead wood. There is a certain type of cross, seemingly originating at about the period with which we are dealing, and quite common in both Gothic and Renaissance art, which appears as if constructed of pieces of tree trunks from which the branches have been lopped, leaving short stumps. Such crosses seem soon to have become conventionalized into forms in which the stumps are all approximately equal in size, are disposed symmetrically upon the limbs of the cross, and point upward along the stem of the cross and outward from the center along the crossbar. In Fig. ii is shown a cross64 of this kind; the two extremities of its crossbar are, it should be observed, cut obliquely"6 and as if to suggest that the crossbar represented was (as must have been the case with actual crosses) a single piece, although the stumps upon it are here represented as pointing in two directions. Such crosses must, it seems clear, have been based upon some symbolic concept. Their basis has, I think, in most cases been assumed to be the idea of the cross being, or symbolizing, the Tree of Life, an idea whose expressions are to be seen in fairly early Christian art and appear in many forms in mediaeval times and later.66 But while there were indeed good reasons for depicting the cross as if of living wood and bearing foliage, I have always found some difficulty in understanding how trunks, obviously dead, trimmed at their ends and with leafless stumps of branches, could have come to represent the quick, vivifying Tree of Life. It is true that sometimes in mediaeval art we find the stumps on a cross pointing 60. It should be observed that, in the miniature of Fig. 15, in which tzhe Saviour seems clearly to be represented as dead, there also is no blood at the nail wounds, while the wound in the side, to which Mary is about to apply a cloth, is not visible. 61. In the Crucifixion scene of Fig. 15 (cf. infra), both Sun and Moon are shown mourning; in that of the English psalter, of about 1250, at All Souls College (cf. p. 84 supra), the Sun is shown as darkened; in that of the Lindsey Psalter, with its blossoming cross (cf. Fig. 17 and p. 97 infra), neither Sun nor Moon appears to mourn. What relation-if any-there was between the relevant Gospel texts (Matthew xxvii, 45; Mark xv, 33; Luke xxiii, 44, 45) and the mediaeval system of representing the Sun and the Moon in symbolical Crucifixion scenes, I do not know. 62.

Dibelius's suggestion as to the derivation of rough-wood crosses from crosses made as if constructed of palm trunks has been mentioned above (p. 90); although I must dissent, for reasons given below, from this view in its general bearings, I think that the adoption of the rough-wood form for crosses may in some instances possibly have been influenced by representations of the Tree of Life serving as the cross and in the likeness (more or less close) of a palm tree. I have recorded above (cf. note 53) that the earliest example of a cross of untrimmed wood cited by Dibelius was the one in the Oberzell wall painting. That painting-which I know only through reproductions of Kraus's sketch-apparently shows the cross with the stumps of branches which spread in both directions from the center of the crossbar. But in what may well be an earlier painting-a symbolical Crucifixion scene (our Lord on the cross, between the Blessed Virgin and St. John), on a leaf (one of two) at Leipzig " of a Sacramentary stitched into an Evangelistary of Reichenau of the tenth century," and called "Alamannic (?) tenth century""-the cross, painted in green, is shown as if of rough wood with all the stumps on the crossbar clearly pointing in one direction; the Saviour is shown as dead, and with all four nail wounds. Still earlier-if we may accept as correct the date commonly assigned to it-is the rough-wood cross shown in Fig. 16, which appears on an ivory book-cover,"6 believed to have been made about A. D. 870,"9 of the Liuthard group, in the Munich Staatsbibliothek. This cross-the earliest of the kind of which I know-is clearly one representing rough, untrimmed wood, for its stumps are irregularly placed and those on the crossbar all point in one direction; it seems certainly not to be a cross derived from or even (unless, possibly, very distantly) related to a "palm-wood" cross. Below the Saviour's feet, and coiled round the stem of the cross, is a serpent,7" perhaps only in general allusion to the conflict between good and evil, or the association between the cross and the Fall, but quite possibly, I think, in particular allusion to the cross's having been made (according to the History of the True Cross) of wood descending directly from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.71 Now, since mediaeval tradition-as embodied in, for example, the well-known and in mediaeval times commonly accepted History of the True Cross-told that the cross was 67.

We may note, however, that "It has been suggested that in an earlier version of the Eden story there was but one tree, the tree of life, . . ." (cf. T. Barns, in Trees and Plants, in Hasting's Encyclo. Religion and Ethics, vol. XII, p. 455); and that "in the earliest stage [of belief] the sacred tree is more than a symbol. It is instinct with divine life, aglow with divine light. It is at once the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" (ibid., p. 448).</page><page sequence="19">96 THE ART BULLETIN of carpentered wood,72 it seems evident that the crosses covered with stumps were most probably based upon some symbolical concept. I think that we have an important clue, to what may have been the principal idea originally underlying the showing of Christ crucified upon a cross made of dead tree trunks with stumps of branches, in Fig. 15. I think it to be by no means unlikely that it was from such crosses as the one there pictured, misinterpreted, or perhaps even knowingly altered, by craftsmen familiar with the symbolism of the Tree of Life as the cross of our Lord, that there have been derived the rough-wood crosses with stumps arranged as upon a tree with truncated branches; they had but to realign the stumps on one side of the crossbar. It may well be, too, that they were to some extent influenced by certain forms of decorative edgings of crosses, comparatively often to be seen in the symbolical Crucifixion scenes of manuscripts and ivory carvings of about the eleventh and twelfth centuries. These edgings, formed each of a continuous line of small oblongs set end-to-end, need only a slight tilting of the axes of the oblongs with respect to the axes of their respective crosses-that is, a tilting which will set the little oblongs like the teeth of a saw, instead of flat along the edges of the cross-to produce an effect much like that representing symmetrically-set little truncated branches. It seems to me possible, therefore, that artists may sometimes have been influenced, on the one hand by a desire to show the cross as if of wood revivified and then become lifeless again, and on the other by a wish to retain the decorative effect of the lines of little oblongs, and because of this have depicted the cross as edged with little stump-like projections, regularly disposed and, for the sake of symmetry, on the crossbar all pointing outward from the center instead of all in one direction. In Fig. 14 we seem to have, in the crucifix and the cross, forms intermediate between those of Fig. 15 and those related to "Tree of Life" types; the crucifix, except for the slight droop of the head, the closed eyes, and the nail wounds, might well be taken to represent Christ Triumphant; and the cross, although modeled upon some cross like the one of Fig. 15, is outlined in green. As to our bronze pectoral cross (see Fig. i), I am strongly inclined to think that we have in it, despite the resemblances between its sprouts and those of the cross of Fig. 14, a representation of the Tree of Life, for not only do the sprouts of its crossbar spring both ways from the center, but they are more developed and more "living" than those of Fig. 14, and the crucifix shows no nail wounds; on the other hand, however, I think it highly probable that the forms of the edging and its sprouts were influenced by representations such as the one in Fig. 14. We have now to ascertain how crosses of the form of the one (see Fig. 15) in the Morgan (Holkham) manuscript came to be depicted. I suggest, as very probable, that they originated through the mediaeval tradition that while Jesus was on the cross, it blossomed 72. E. g., a twelfth century version, published in A. S. Napier's History of the Holy Rood-tree (London [Early English Text Society., no. 1031, 1894, cf. p. 25, lines 3 f.), says that the sacred tree-descending directly from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and grown upon Adam's grave-cut down for use in Solomon's Temple, was hewed by the carpenters on the spot where it was felled; and the version in Harleian MS. 4196, published in R. Morris's Legends of the Holy Rood (London [E. E. T. S., no. 46], 1871; cf. p. 79, giving line 631), says that the workmen polished the beam and made it plane. Caxton's translation of The Golden Legend, under "Of the invention of the Holy Cross," says only that Solomon had the sacred tree cut down and buried (cf. F. S. Ellis's ed., in The Temple Classics, vol. III, p. 170).</page><page sequence="20">A MEDIAEVAL BRONZE PECTORAL CROSS 97 from midday until compline.73 In Fig. 15 the cross appears just as if it had been constructed of two separate pieces of wood which had become revivified, had sent out shoots, and had died again; and upon it hangs the dead body of our Lord. We have therefore, in Fig. 15, taken from an English manuscript of the early eleventh century-a time not greatly later than the times to which the Munich ivory (cf. p. 95 supra), the Leipzig illumination (cf. p. 95), and the Oberzell wall painting (cf. note 53, supra) have been attributed-what seems to be an exact pictorial representation of a belief, whose origin and age are unknown,"7 which we find incorporated in an English book of the fourteenth century. The Legend of the Dry Tree, of which the story of the revivified wood sometimes forms a part, may well have influenced in another way the conformation of mediaeval crosses such as those with which we have been concerned above. This legend,75 which is intimately connected with the Legend of the True Cross, has caused the Dry Tree often to be employed symbolically in art, and has led to representations of Christ crucified upon a dead tree.'7 It seems quite obvious that the crosses in Figs. 14 and 15 do not represent the Dry Tree; but they may, I think, have led to, or have influenced the production of, crosses representing the Dry Tree with our Lord hanging upon it.77 I think, as I have said above (p. 96), that the weight of evidence is in favor of the Tree of Life having been the archetype of crosses whose truncated branches point in both directions on the crossbar; but there seems to be a possibility that at least some of the crosses of that kind were intended to represent symbolically the Dry Tree. I have said above that the origin and age of the belief in the temporary revivification of the wood of the cross were unknown, and that our earliest direct evidence concerning a belief of the kind is contained in a Northumbrian poem of the fourteenth century (cf. notes 73, 74, supra); that is, our earliest direct evidence of the belief is much later than the miniature containing the cross (dating from the early eleventh century) which I take to have been inspired by the belief. There is, however, other evidence, some of it considerably earlier than the fourteenth century, which (although indirectly) suggests, or even seems to vouch for, the contemporaneous existence of the belief. The more questionable portion of this evidence consists of certain floral, or floralized, crosses bearing the crucified Saviour. A particularly fine cross of the kind is shown in Fig. 17, which reproduces78 the well-known symbolical Crucifixion scene in the Psalter of Robert of Lindsey, Abbot of Peterborough from 1214 to 1222, illuminated at Peterborough and presumably a little before 1222. In this, Christ appears crucified upon a cross of green leaves and red or white flowers, symmetrically disposed, within a blue cross-shaped area. 73. Cf.

The leaves and flowers on the crossbar, it is true, all point away from the center, instead of all in one direction as they should if the crossbar had blossomed as a single piece of revivified timber; but this might well be accounted for, I think, by the artist's obvious preoccupation with the symmetry of his design. And, although the Saviour's eyes are shown as closed, this may have been meant only to suggest weariness, and not death; we are not able to say decisively. Per contra, neither the Blessed Virgin nor St. John seems to be weeping, nor do the Sun and the Moon, as we might reasonably expect to find the case were the Saviour to be pictured as dead (cf. note 61, supra). Thus, such evidence as is presented by Crucifixion scenes like that of the Lindsey Psalter is too inconclusive to be permitted to serve, save corroboratively should further contemporary (or earlier) evidence supporting it be forthcoming. Moreover, until such further evidence be presented, or until we know more concerning the origin of the story of the cross's blossoming, we must continue to keep in mind the possibility that that story originally was inspired by-instead of inspiring-pictures of floral or vegetational crosses."8 On the other hand, the representing, in one set of Passion scenes, of a cross of wood carpentered and smooth before the Crucifixion and later either blossoming or covered with dead sprouts, should, I think, suffice to give us reasonably clear and decisive evidence of a contemporaneous belief that the wood of the cross became alive during the Crucifixion. It is unfortunate for our investigation that sets of Passion scenes in which rough-wood crosses appear at all are comparatively rare; and, further, that the scene of the Carrying of the Cross occurs in only a small proportion of mediaeval sets of Passion scenes. I have examined a considerable number of manuscripts, ivory carvings, and other objects made before 1400, in or upon which scenes from the Passion appear, but in none of these have I found the cross shown as other than smooth before the Crucifixion. While this circumstance is, of course, valid only as negative evidence, its import is confirmed by the occurrence of at least one instancesl in which the cross, shown smooth before the Crucifixion, is shown as rough after it. In the St. Albans Psalter,82 an English manuscript of the twelfth century, now in the St. Godehardskirche, at Hildesheim, on fols. 23 v. and 24 respectively, appear the scenes reproduced"3 in Figs. i8 and 19. In the Carrying of the Cross, of Fig. i8, the cross is clearly of smooth, carpentered wood; in the Deposition, of Fig. 19, the cross is shown with little shoots-which, be it observed, on the crossbar point all in one direction, precisely as 79. Cf. Hildburgh, An Alabaster Table of the Annuncia- tion with the Crucifix, p. 217. 80o. This reservation, naturally, does not apply to the cases of trees, or of smaller plants (such as the lily plant) upon which occasionally the Saviour has been represented as crucified; for some examples, cf. An Alabaster Table of the Annunciation with the Crucifix, fig. 3 of pl. LXXIV, and fig. 4, with relevant text on pp. 215, 214. 81. I have to thank Mr. Thomas Jeffery for bringing this to my notice. 82. On this manuscript, see A. Goldschmidt, Der Albanipsalter in Hildesheim, Berlin, 1895. Messrs. F. H.

This, together with the fact that the second scene is not one representing Christ upon the cross- as to whose precise signification there might be some question-but is one in which the dead Saviour is being taken from the cross,84 seems almost unquestionably to show that the artist, when he painted his Deposition scene, had in mind to represent the wood which miraculously had lived and died twice, and not a symbolic Tree of Life. It is interesting to find, in a somewhat later Crucifixion scene-the Saviour upon the cross, between the Blessed Virgin and St. John-also associated with St. Albans, a rough- wood cross in which the little projections on the crossbar point in both directions from the center, instead of all in one direction. In this scene, painted upon a nave pier of St. Albans Church,85 and attributed tentatively to the first quarter of the thirteenth century,"86 the cross is green, suggesting that-as is suggested also by the uniformly outward-pointing protuberances on the crossbar-the painter had in mind to re'present the Tree of Life rather than a cross of revivified timber. The particular interest of the painting in connection with our investigation is that it seems to illustrate for us the transition- 84. A rough-wood cross, with all the excrescences of the crossbar similarly pointing in one direction, appears in the well-known Deposition scene in the cloisters of the Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos (cf. W. W. S. Cook, in Art Bulletin, vol. X [1927], pp. 200 [for fig. 72], 197 f.; E. Bertaux, in Gaz. des beaux-arts, vol. XXXVI [I906], p. 37; E. Roulin, in Rev. de l'art chrdtien, vol. LX [I9Iol, p. 3 [with fig. 341; G. Weise, Spanische Plastik aus Siebein Jahrhunderten, vol. II, Reutlingen, 1927, pl. 4 [and pp. io ff. of text]; A. Kingsley Porter, Romanesque Sculpture of the Pilgrimage Roads, vol. VI, Boston, 1923, pl. 669 [with discussion in chap. iv, pp. 44-58, of vol. I]; plaster casts in the Madrid Museo de Reproducciones Artisticas and the LQndon Victoria and Albert Museum), one of a group of six, all representing Passion scenes after the Crucifixion. Kingsley Porter has assigned (cf. loc. cit.) the relief to the last quarter, and perhaps the last fifteen years, of the eleventh century; Cook believes that the "relief cannot be placed earlier than the middle of the twelfth century" (cf. op. cit., p. 198); Bertaux dates it (cf. loc. cit.) about the middle of the twelfth century; most other writers have either followed Bertaux's views or have suggested a period earlier in the twelfth century (cf. Cook, op. cit., notes iii and 117 for several references not cited above). Cook, who attributes (p. 197) the rough trim- ming of this cross to "characteristic Spanish realism," reproduces (fig. 62; cf. pp. 194, 197), from a Catalan manuscript assigned to the eleventh century, a Deposition scene in which both upright and crossbar of the cross have truncated little branches, which on the crossbar-- one of whose arms, it should be observed, is almost double the thickness of the other-both (there is only one on either arm) point outward; these circumstances suggest that, if the artist was not merely ignorantly, and mis- takenly, copying an earlier miniature, he may have in- tended to represent the cross as a withered tree, one of whose limbs was thicker than the other. In the Kaiser Friedrich Museum is the central section of a small folding altar, of pear wood carved in high relief, which has a Deposition scene whose cross is, seemingly, intermediate between the crosses with dead (or lopped) branches and those whose form appears to associate them with the Tree of Life in the form of a palm (cf. my On Palm-tree Crosses, p. 57). This carving, the museum's no. 3145, is reproduced and discussed in T. Demmler's Die Bildwerke des deutschen Museums: (vol. III) Die Bildwerke in Holz, Stein, und Ton, Berlin and Leipzig, 1930, pp. 3 f., and is there called Rhenish, of the second half of the eleventh century, and compared in style and in some details with the wooden doors of St. Maria in Kapitol, at Cologne; it was formerly attributed to the Treves district and about the middle of the twelfth century (cf. W. V6ge, K6nigliche Museen zu Berlin: Die deutschen Bildwerke . Berlin, I910, pp. 3 f.). Above the crossbar, the upper part of the cross shows several small rounded projections, below (and in part surrounding) each of which is a sort of concentric swelling. The swellings below the projections seem to show that there has not been, in this case, an intention of representing lopped branches; on the other hand, the distances between the projections, and their form, suggest that the projections were meant to represent each a sort of scar where a shoot had withered. Un- fortunately for us, the little projections are entirely lacking from one arm of the cross, and the single direction in which those present point does not enable us to say decisively whether the craftsman meant to represent a cross whose wood had been revivified and had died, or a cross of Tree of Life type, or a cross constructed of untrimmed logs. I am inclined, however, to think that, even if the revivified cross did not give the craftsman immediate inspiration, some representation of that cross served him for his prototype. 85. Cf. W.

However, we should not put overmuch faith in this interpretation, for there remains not only a possibility of the pier painting being of a date later than the period commonly assigned to it, but a possibility also of its having been repainted long after it was first made, and altered, by the re-aligning of the stumps on one arm of the crossbar, from the unidirectional type to the ambidirectional. In the absence of anything quite similar to it, and lacking unquestionable dates for objects whose iconography even approaches that of our pectoral cross, it is difficult to fix at all closely the date at which it was made. I am inclined to attribute it to the first half- perhaps even the first quarter-of the eleventh century, despite the views of several learned German authorities who, having seen photographs of it, have believed it to be of the twelfth century or, in one case, of the early thirteenth. The general "feeling" of the whole object seems to me to be rather that of a fine Carolingian ivory carving, translated into a cire-perdu bronze, than that of a work of the twelfth century; but it would be unwise to emphasize too much this personal element in my attribution. We have seen, in bronze, an edging to a tree-form cross, very like the one on our cross, on the Hildesheim door, made about ioi5; our cross, being less conventionalized, conceivably may be of slightly earlier date. A very similar edging to a cross, in an English manuscript of about io6o, has been shown in Fig. 14. In ivory, we may see something resembling-but less markedly- our edging in the cross of a symbolic Crucifixion scene upon a book-cover in the Carlsruhe Landesbibliothek, attributed tentatively to South Germany or the Rhineland of the eleventh or the twelfth century;"8 that cover, however, seems clearly to be of later date than our cross, and its crucifix, although with the feet turned outwards and its head in almost the same position as on our cross, differs in many respects from the latter's crucifix-in its much less emaciated body, in its considerably lower hands, in the knotting and in the folds of its much shorter loin cloth, in its suppedaneum, in its showing of the wounds in the hands and feet, in its strongly in-turned thumbs,88 in the beaded edge of its nimbus, and in other less important details. The wavy lines within the cross of Fig. 14 recall in a way the treatment of the interior surface of our cross; a somewhat closer actual resemblance may be seen in the representations of the ground and of clouds on an ivory plaque in the Victoria and Albert Museum (no. 254-I867),"9 classed with the Liuthard group of ivories (of perhaps Northern French origin) and assigned to the middle of the ninth century. The very unusual treatment of the loin cloth might help us to date our cross, could we but find another example of it.1" We have seen, in Fig. 14, a central overhanging portion closely resembling the one on our cross; another parallel occurs on a fragmentary ivory crucifix, in the Vermeylen collection, in Brussels,91 attributed to Belgium and the second half of the twelfth century, in other respects-excepting for the exposure of one knee and the covering of the other-unlike our crucifix; and another on a similar fragment, found 87.

But the nearest parallel known to me of the curious overhanging projection on either side on our crucifix occurs on an ivory plaque showing a symbolic Crucifixion, attributed by Goldschmidt93 to the twelfth century and, tentatively, to the Rhineland, the crucifix of which has no suppedaneum and seems (so far as I can judge from the reproduction of the photograph) not to have nails through either hands or feet, though otherwise it differs considerably from our bronze one-the loin cloth is shorter and its roughly horizontal edge is well above both knees and its central part is very differently disposed, the body is not nearly so emaciated, the hands are about level with the mouth, and the eyes are not only different in treatment but clearly are open-and appears to me to be distinctly later in date. The other most nearly analogous examples that I am able to cite do little more than suggest these curious projections: they are the loin cloths in our Fig. 14; in an ivory book-cover, of the Metz school of the ninth or tenth century, in the Victoria and Albert Museum (no. 250-I867);94 and in another book-cover, of the same school and period, at Gannat.95 The sloping edge of the loin cloth which leaves one knee bare whilst covering the other has on several occasions been cited to me as evidence suggesting that our cross is to be attributed to the twelfth or the early thirteenth century. It is true that on the two ivory crucifixes (the one in the Vermeylen collection and the London one) above mentioned the loin cloths are shown thus; but loin cloths in that position appear to have been com- paratively rare on ivories of the twelfth, and to occur on a much larger proportion of the surviving ivories assigned to the tenth century.96 They occur, furthermore, on the crucifix of the silver cross attributed to Bishop Bernward (cf. supra, p. 80) of Hildesheim;97 on the cover of St. Elisabeth's Psalter (cf. pp. 8M f. supra); and (to all intents and purposes, although in each the covered kneecap actually is partially exposed) on the crucifixes of Figs. 15 and 16. In the miniature of Christ on the Cross, on fol. 39 of the little Prayer Book of Charles the Bald (t877), which in some respects so resembles the engraving on the Cross of Lothair"9 that Cahier gave a drawing of it99 when discussing that cross, there is a loin cloth sloping as on our pectoral cross, together with several other features-the head below the level of the hands, the nimbus, the lack of a suppedaneum, the thumbs 92.

The details of the loin cloth, the representing of four nails (instead of none), and the treat- ment of the eyes, however, are not the same as on our cross. The "Egbert-cross" at Maastricht, whose cloisonne' enamel is clearly Trives work of the late tenth century (cf. von Falke and Frauberger, op. cit., p. 5 [with fig. 2]), has an ivory crucifix of presumably the same locality and date (cf. Elfenbeinskulpturen, vol. II [i918], no. 172), with left knee covered and right knee bare and with ribs strongly marked, which, however, differs from our bronze one in several important particulars. A sloping edge occurs also on the V. and A. Museum's book-cover (no.250-1867) above referred to, but so high as to leave exposed both knees. 97.

Unfortunately, we are debarred from drawing any definite conclusions from these resemblances, for the miniature was "restored" and in parts-including some of those of most interest to us-in or about the fifteenth century.100 From the unsatisfactory, and all too scanty, evidence above cited we may, I think, most reasonably conclude that our pectoral cross probably was made somewhere in the Lorraine district, and not much, if at all, later than the first quarter of the eleventh century. There are indeed, as we have seen, analogies which suggest the possibility of a date in the tenth century, but our knowledge of the industrial art of the whole period is so uncertain, and there is such likelihood that the maker of this originally unimportant object followed traditional ideas, that I hesitate to place its date earlier than the eleventh. 1oo.
