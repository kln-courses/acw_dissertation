<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Far Side of Paradise: California, Florida, and the Landscape of Catastrophe Carl Smith Ecology of Fear: Los Angeles and the Imagination of Disaster By Mike Davis Metropolitan Books, 1998 Five Fires. Race, Catastrophe, and the Shaping of California By David Wyatt Addison- Wesley, 1997 Hurricane Andrew. Ethnicity, Gender, and the Sociology of Disasters Edited by Walter Gillis Peacock, Betty Hearn Morrow, and Hugh Gladwin Routledge, 1997 California and Florida, more specifically the southern reaches of both states, occupy analogous places in the actual and imaginative landscape. They are literally and figuratively at the edge of the nation, alternative realms of opportunity and sun- shine that have long lured newcomers from around the world and across the country. Precisely because these lands of hope have attracted so many people of such varied backgrounds, they also seem to be at the forefront of our increasingly contested national life. The populations of both consist of a comparably volatile, if hardly identical, demographic mix, in which the race card is al- ways wild. What most captures our attention nowadays are the troubles of both states, which seem especially profound and per- verse because of the high and often unrealistic, even desperate, expectations that have been loaded on them. California, Joan Didion has written, "is a place in which a boom mentality and a sense of Chekhovian loss meet in uneasy suspension; in which the mind is troubled by some buried but ineradicable suspicion that things had better work here, because here, beneath that im- mense bleached sky, is where we run out of continent (Slouch- ing 172).1 These three books explore some of the most dramatic in- stances of things not working, the spectacular disasters that are part of local experience in both locales. Whatever their other considerable differences, all of them are examples of a hybrid genre that cuts across the social sciences and humanities, the examination of place through the study of catastrophe. While the authors of these works acknowledge and appreciate the in- herent appeal on the sensational level of the catastrophic even apart from specific geographical and cultural circumstances, they share with many perceptive observers the supposition that disorder and disruption reflect and reveal the fundamental struc- C 2001 OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY</page><page sequence="2">American Literary History 355 ture and system of values that animate and distinguish the socie- ties they beset. "Everything that can happen to a man in the way of disaster," Mary Douglas argues, "should be catalogued according to the active principles involved in the universe of his particular culture" (4).2 How a society conceives and encounters catastrophe reveals what it is. In the last decade of the millennium, Mike Davis became famous in some quarters, notorious arguing that the Califor- nia dream, or at least the Los Angeles component of it, is one long nightmare from which locals refuse to awake. Davis made his case most prominently in City of Quartz: Excavating the Fu- ture in Los Angeles (1990), in which his contention is that Los Angeles's built environment is one only Darth Vader could love. Faced with breathtaking beauty and bounty, Angelenos have erected a world that, from downtown skyscraper-fortresses fes- tooned with surveillance systems (which do, indeed, look as if they might be corporate headquarters of the Empire) to exclusive Westside enclaves where the most common lawn decoration is the "Armed Response" sign, reflects and reinforces a series of dark victories: of presentism over planning, unenlightened self- interest over community, rich over poor, racism over the melting pot. Davis's L. A., which, he sees as the full incarnation of late capitalism, is not an expansive city on a hill but a monument to the diminishment of the human spirit. Those who have best learned to play Los Angeles as it lays approach it as a zero-sum game in which the highest imperative is to preserve one's safety and property. The softer underbelly of the angry beast that is Davis's critique is a lament for the rejection of finer and wiser alternatives, notably a socialist (or at least socially aware) and environmentally sensitive peaceable polis. In Ecology of Fear. Los Angeles and the Imagination of Di- saster, Davis recasts his arguments in a more cosmic ecocritical framework. The City of Angels is not simply a botched settle- ment, but hell on earth. Its climatic and geological conditions are such that it should never have been built in the first place, at least not in the way it has been. According to Davis, "For generations, market-driven urbanization has transgressed envi- ronmental common sense" (9), which would have taken into ac- count the region's flood-or-drought precipitation history, its tec- tonically terrifying underpinnings, its tinderbox of foliage and overbuilding, the frequency with which it is hit by tornadoes, and the displaced wildlife that currently menaces suburban sprawl. To make matters far worse, every "solution" to these problems has failed to reduce physical danger while deepening social injus- tice, as the rich and powerful successfully demand largely in-</page><page sequence="3">356 California, Florida, and the Landscape of Catastrophe effective and ecologically senseless protection at spiraling public cost, so that "people of color are doubly punished by natural and political disasters" (51). Davis's writing is a magisterial combination of salient anec- dote, imaginative insight, authoritative detail, stylistic flourish, and oracular pronouncement, generating energy from its own out- rage and holding everything together with an authorial swagger that is at once street-smart and theory-wise. It is no wonder that he has become a much-cited figure, embraced by small-is-beauti- ful and anti-growth advocates, hated by developers and their al- lies. Academics don't quite know what to do with him. His blue- collar background, his passionate immersion in his cause, his dis- dain for the ivory tower, his noir sensibility, and his (self)righ- teous politics give him an enviable authenticity and confidence.3 His wide reading, profusion of footnotes, and ability to talk the scholar's talk across multiple disciplines as well as walk the activ- ist's walk in a way few professors or even public intellectuals can make him tough not to take very seriously, though some factual errors, unsubstantiated assertions, oversimplified science, and his unapologetic defense of all of these cause even those who agree with his leftist politics uneasiness. All this has led to much con- troversy in the print media and spun a long Mike Davis thread on the Internet.4 David Wyatt's Five Fires: Race, Catastrophe, and the Shap- ing of California shares several of Davis's contrarian concerns, though he voices them in a meditative rather than polemical register. Wyatt sees California's past invested from the arrival of the white man with the logic of acquisition and exclusion, from which terrible social consequences have inevitably followed. Attempts at conquest, possession, and mastery not only have brought misery to many, but also have contained within them- selves the seeds of their own undoing. In some cases the seeds were literal, as the first of the several major literal and metaphori- cal fires Wyatt surveys is the displacement of the region's high native grass by the wild oats that arrived with the European ex- plorers and settlers. This inadvertent crop became a permanent marker of the Spaniards' presence long after they were gone, as well as of the displacement of the Native Americans by the Ca- lifornios, and, after 1846, by the Anglos.5 Wyatt finds it fitting that the wild oat made the whole region disastrously fire-prone, since he sees a racist imperative behind California's history that has given its culture as a whole an incen- diary character. As proof, Wyatt cites the succession of "consum- ing cultural events" that were the Gold Rush (8), the San Fran- cisco earthquake and fire, the social conflicts of the World War</page><page sequence="4">American Literary History 357 II era (notably the Zoot Suit Riots), and the ghetto violence from the mid-1960s to the present. In Wyatt's conception, the fifth fire of race is the all-consuming one that runs through the previous four and encompasses long-standing anti-Asian and anti-Latino as well as anti-black prejudice. His book examines all these "fires" and numerous other events, and it includes the requisite chapter, in a California book, on water. The collection of essays in Hurricane Andrew: Ethnicity, Gender, and the Sociology of Disasters was prepared by a team of scholars based at Florida International University (Walter Gillis Peacock is listed as Director of Research at the International Hurricane Center, while Betty Hearn Morrow and Hugh Glad- win are professors of sociology and anthropology, respectively). Hurricane Andrew is thus not the expression of a single and self- consciously idiosyncratic sensibility like Davis's or Wyatt's, but a series of findings and policy recommendations, full of talk of impacts and outcomes by researchers whose subject the costli- est disaster in US history hit them where they lived, in Dade County just south of Miami, on a fearsome August dawn in 1992.6 The 12 essays by its three editors and eight other investiga- tors do not do much to shake humanists' often smug prejudice against social science as presenting unsurprising discoveries in a way that is at once both stilted and bland, since most of the find- ings, while unquestionably important and deserving of close scrutiny, are intuitively predictable. Amid all the diligent and al- most affectless earnestness, respectfully lodged in the parameters of the voluminous relevant research, Hurricane Andrew, for all its force and fury, sometimes loses its identity as a living, breath- ing catastrophe. Among the unremarkable discoveries: the market-driven di- saster recovery system practiced in the US is inherently conserva- tive, aimed at restoration of the preexisting order rather than eq- uity and redevelopment; different groups within society compete for postdisaster resources, which can have a negative effect on community recovery as a whole; disaster situations put a pre- mium on social leaders who are flexible, adaptable, and learn fast; families with strong internal bonds negotiate the return to normal more successfully than those with weak internal bonds; the media play an important role in how we experience disaster; wealthy white people who have good insurance do better follow- ing property loss than poor black people who have no or bad insurance, so that the overall effect of calamity is not to act as a great equalizer, as popular rhetoric might have it, but to reinforce class difference. When it comes to specific proposals of how things might be</page><page sequence="5">358 California, Florida, and the Landscape of Catastrophe improved, what Hurricane Andrew offers is common sense. The authors' recommendations mainly consist of suggesting ways in- dividuals and groups should work together better; there is little of Davis's argument that they were all fools to live there at all, or to build as they did.7 This is perhaps because many of An- drew's victims were so economically and politically disadvan- taged that they had little choice. "If FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency], the state, and insurance companies are serious with their current rhetoric to shift the high costs of disas- ter recovery to the up-front costs of paying for mitigation," Glad- win and Peacock contend, "then more initiatives are needed to help households and communities prepare for South Florida's inevitable future hurricanes" (61). The trick is to figure out how to encourage or force the state and insurance companies to get serious about such initiatives. In fairness, there are some intriguing observations, unex- pected discoveries, and imaginative presentations of information. Harvey Averch and Milan J. Dluhy, in a chapter titled "Crisis Decision Making and Management," make the point that plan- ning an effective evacuation strategy in the face of a hurricane is inherently problematic, since part of the challenge presented by tropical storms (as well as by other extreme weather conditions) is that it is impossible to know up to the last minute exactly where or when they will hit populated areas, if at all, so that "it will be technically and bureaucratically prudent to give warnings as late as possible, to increase the probability that the correct popula- tions and jurisdictions respond" (77). Peacock and A. Kathleen Ragsdale suggest that Andrew did upset the status quo in at least a limited way, with more black representatives getting elected in its wake and George Bush's 1992 presidential reelection cam- paign being damaged because of the apparently slow response of his administration to "feel the pain" of those hit by the storm. Minority families, according to statistics cited by Morrow (the book is full of tables), "are more apt to have been helped by relatives," so that, "[c]ontrary to previous research, income does not have an effect" (146). Like Wyatt and unlike Davis, several contributors pay special attention to gender. This is a welcome corrective, Morrow and Elaine Enarson point out, since "[t]he 'official story' of disasters generally overlooks women's experi- ences as victims, as well as responders" (116). All three books make somewhat unsubstantiated claims for the distinctiveness of their studies as examinations of place and disaster, at the same time insufficiently contextualizing their findings. Most of Davis's arguments have been made in a tone less fervid, if no less deeply felt, by historians of the environment</page><page sequence="6">American Literary History 359 in general and of California in particular, cultural geographers of both the modern and postmodern variety, and political theorists, many of whom are cited in his acknowledgments and in his 40 crowded pages of endnotes.8 It is his mixture of anger, detail, and bravado that most gives him a distinctive voice and makes him an arresting read, though Ecology of Fear does not have the same freshness as City of Quartz. Wyatt's contention that California's history is in substantial measure defined by a sequence of inter- twined environmental and social disasters in which racism has been an important element is not as striking an observation as it might have been before the advent of recent western and environ- mental history. Davis and Wyatt in particular participate in what urban his- torian Philip J. Ethington has criticized as the tendency of some scholars of contemporary Los Angeles to make hyperbolic claims without substantiation that the city is new and different in being or having the most this or that.9 Among Davis's argu- ments, for example, is the repeated assertion that Los Angeles is a unique or extreme case, even as he concedes at least the possi- bility of comparison with other places, including South Florida. "What is most distinctive about Los Angeles," Davis writes, "is not simply its conjugation of earthquakes, wildfires, and floods, but its uniquely explosive mixture of natural hazards and social contradictions. Not even Miami, that other fallen paradise, can approach the conflagrationist potential of Los Angeles" (54). In Davis's work the problem is rarely an absence of specifics to back up such claims indeed, his work is replete with factoids but that their authority and derivation are sometimes dubious.'0 When confronted with this, he dismisses criticism on such points as incidental, as having no effect on the fundamental correctness of what he is saying. Wyatt's evidence for some of his generalizations about Cali- fornia's distinctiveness is, in contrast, frequently vague, which makes his book less persuasive. In the first chapter, for example, Wyatt maintains that "California remains the place where Americans draw the battle lines over difference" (6), and he later claims that the population explosion ignited by the Gold Rush "transformed California into an unmanaged experiment in inter- ethnic comity" (50). Couldn't the same be said about the effect on any number of nineteenth-century northern cities of immigration from Europe and elsewhere in the US? Wyatt argues that San Franciscans "survived the earthquake and fire by subsuming the experiencing into the spectatorial self" (109), but his treatment of disaster as spectacle (which underestimates the very immedi- ate and tangible horror, suffering, and loss many people felt as</page><page sequence="7">360 California, Florida, and the Landscape of Catastrophe actors, and not just as spectators, in this catastrophe) does not explain how this response was different from that of other local populations to any number of other prior or subsequent major disasters in this country or elsewhere. Similarly, even if one con- cedes his contention about the L. A. riots of 1992, "that no event in recent American history has so clearly foregounded the fact that description is interpretation and that even in taking in the riot we help to produce it" (218), this doesn't explain California culture or why it is distinctive. Some of Hurricane Andrew's points about race, precisely be- cause of their statistical basis and the more academic and appar- ently objective tone in which they are delivered, are more con- vincing than either Davis's or Wyatt's declarations. In trying to understand the dynamics of disaster, however, Hurricane Andrew might have benefited from a broader historical perspective, which would have explained which circumstances of the storm were local and timely (and perhaps more readily amendable), and which are ingrained in human behavior patterns regardless of time and place. Like Wyatt and Davis, its authors seem to feel obliged to claim that the events they study are unique to their setting. Several other recent works, however, analyze the way the postdisaster terrain, despite all the talk of sudden equaliza- tion and communities of common suffering, is always contested. In Smoldering City. Chicagoans and the Great Fire, 1871-1874 (1995), Karen Sawislak examines how extensively the rebuilding of Chicago was inflected by class difference. We Will Rebuild, a group of Miami business leaders formed at the request of Presi- dent Bush, pursued a recovery policy supposedly for everyone's benefit but that in fact focused on their own concerns in a man- ner that recalls the attitudes and practices of the Chicago Relief and Aid Society, another private group of businessmen entrusted with the public good 120 years earlier.1' Perhaps the greatest interest of these books to readers of this journal, however, is their contribution not just as studies of California or Florida as revealed through the category of catas- trophe, but of what might be called the literary dimensions of how individuals, groups, and societies deal with disaster. It is through words, from basic terms and descriptions to larger nar- ratives and mythologies, that we define the disastrous in the first place and in relation to an existing cultural vocabulary. It can be argued that what distinguishes a traumatic event as truly cata- strophic in the modern era both the Holocaust and Hiroshima are the leading examples is that it will not fit an available frame- work of understanding and expression, so new ones must, with difficulty, be devised as part of the effort of survival and recovery.</page><page sequence="8">American Literary History 361 Language, and especially figurative language and literary forms, are always interpretive as well as descriptive, even when they seem most "objective," a term which itself involves numerous assump- tions about what constitutes fact and what any fact means.12 Even if one can question Wyatt's insistence that no other event has so clearly foregrounded the relationship between interpreta- tion and description as the Los Angeles riots of 1992, he does a good job of unpacking the dynamics of that relationship. Given that Wyatt is an English professor, it is not surprising that his is the most literary of these three books. His study, he points out, "is a history mediated by literature" (9). Throughout the state's history, he contends, "writing about California has been a deeply metaphorical enterprise, a continuing and con- tested act of the imagination" (8). While he offers a direct ac- count of his different fires, Wyatt mainly focuses on how they have been imagined by numerous other commentators, from Richard Henry Dana to Robert Altman. He sees this imagining almost entirely in constructive perhaps a better adjective would be re- constructive terms. The special value of the works he intro- duces is that, in his opinion, they offer both writer and reader a means of dealing with terrible and regrettable events, "the chance to feel our way into the heart of California's history and to ex- change distance and judgment for recognition and empathy" (2). Wyatt states that California is distinct in being "many-voiced" (the emphasis is Wyatt's) and, while one could counter that this is another respect in which California is hardly unique, Wyatt's wish "to let many voices speak" is ambitious and promising (9). This strategy squares with Wyatt's larger purpose, which is not to bury Californians but to praise them, since the story he wishes to tell is as much one of resilience as of venality. He for- wards a neo-Darwinian view maintaining that the state is differ- ent from other places because of the way its history of disaster has demanded and developed "a certain kind of citizen" that Wyatt, a native Californian himself (as is Davis), clearly admires. He claims that "[t]hese moments of catastrophe could be read as moments of creation, events that call forth the sheer power of Californians to adapt and to survive" (2). He remarks similarly that the voices he cites offer a "complex and moving testimony to the human capacity for adaptation and resistance" (9). As a participant-observer, and as an academic admittedly seeking a new audience with what he calls a cross-over book, Wyatt also deems it useful and appropriate to intersperse briefly here and there some of his own personal and family recollections, which "are meant to suggest that I see myself as not above but in the story" (9) 13</page><page sequence="9">362 California, Florida, and the Landscape of Catastrophe So we don't simply get Wyatt's version of John C. Fremont's impetuous takeover of Mexican California in 1846, but also his sympathetic reading of an 1886 history of the American con- quest as "an unfortunate fall" by Josiah Royce (23), another local boy who pursued an academic career across the continent. Wyatt mines the meaning of the Gold Rush through a wide range of voices, the most affecting being the letters and diaries, previously annotated in J. S. Holliday's The World Rushed In: The California Gold Rush (1981), of William Swain, his wife Sabrina, and his brother George, who collectively reveal the terrible costs in hu- man terms of this whole adventure. Wyatt's discussion of the Gold Rush, the domestic relations of the Swains, and the almost exclusively male world of the mining camps also includes Wyatt's most successful of several considerations of gender. Late in the book, Wyatt considers contemporary racial violence through his experience of witnessing researcher-playwright-actor Anna Deavere Smith's one-woman show, Twilight (1992), in which she channels selected voices from the 200 people she interviewed in an attempt to view from the inside out the riots that followed the acquittal of the police officers who bludgeoned Rodney King. Hurricane Andrew contributors Enarson and Morrow offer a variation on Smith's approach when they present their research on women's experience through the "accounts" of four "fiction- alized" social types: a social worker, a single grandmother in public housing, a relocated trailer camp resident, and a small business owner. Wyatt's strategy works well in stretches, but his metaphori- cal center sometimes fails to hold, as it becomes uncertain what this or that discussion has to do with real or figurative fire. And while Wyatt is a sensitive, perceptive, and eloquent guide, it is not always clear where he is taking us. In his desire to let other voices speak, Wyatt introduces a wonderful array of texts, sup- plemented by a number of haunting photographs, but he gets into many brief allusions that can read like loose association, especially when the fire metaphor burns only dimly and the con- nection with race or gender seems pretty attenuated. Seeing the state through the words of others can make California and catas- trophe seem far away in a book that proposes to take the reader into the hearts of both. His account of going to see Twilight is a representative instance in which he seems to be viewing Califor- nia through another's performance of it. In addition, his talk of survival is a small and rather vague consolation, given the scale of the physical and social tragedies he describes, and it borders on unconvincing rationalization and self-congratulation that grants one a superior status based on coming from California</page><page sequence="10">American Literary History 363 because life there has been, at least in Wyatt's opinion, a history of struggle. Besides, residents of plenty of other places, notably New Yorkers, have made the same questionable claim of superi- ority by dint of living in an especially difficult and exciting place, which perhaps explains why much of the rest of the country sometimes can barely repress its satisfaction when trouble hits Los Angeles or Manhattan. Davis's book more compellingly gets into what is at stake in how people imagine, talk, and write about catastrophe through his consideration of what he calls in his subtitle "the imagination of disaster." Unlike Wyatt, Davis's interest in lan- guage and literature is not as adaptation and resistance to the catastrophic but in terms of what he sees as their complicity with it. To Davis, ideas and words are tools of power that those in positions of influence have used to advance a fundamental un- derstanding of reality that appears to be neutral and objective but expresses a particular and all-too-frequently regressive set of interests. This understanding is rooted in the distinction we make between "natural" and "man-made" disasters as they apply to populated places. The first classification is usually assigned to events attributed to accidental fire, disease, and extraordinary meteorological or geological conditions, rather than to internal rioting, purposeful destruction, technological failures, and war. Davis, like several leading environmentalist scholars, argues con- vincingly against making such distinctions, especially when the terms nature and natural, as well as what they might mean, are themselves man-made.'4 Davis chronicles the insanity of Californians' building and living as they have and where they are, defying nature and, as the saying goes, inviting disaster. This often involves expensive and potentially fatal self-delusion, as in the state's Seismic Safety Commission's report on the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which Davis calls a "compendium of cowardice" (46). Instead of for- bidding intensive development in disaster-prone terrain (which, after reading Davis's apocalyptic descriptions of all the floods, fire, earthquakes, and tornadoes that have struck the area, may seem like all of L.A.), government officials have arrogantly con- structed "pharaonic public works" (Davis's adjectives are the most arresting and distracting element of his style) whose main purpose is to support the relentless suburbanization that only brings more "natural" disaster (53). The imaginative component of this madness is the way Cali- fornians have twisted and collapsed the natural-man-made di- chotomy to naturalize what they have done while demonizing the more legitimately natural as perversity. V/hen disaster strikes,</page><page sequence="11">364 California, Florida, and the Landscape of Catastrophe ... we blame nature for intruding maliciously into a certain set of profoundly flawed human choices that are erroneously posited as normal, sane, and right. This mode of thinking proceeds because it is hardwired into the logic of capital, the opposition to which is too scattered, too focused on local rather than regional issues, and too politically naive to deter the juggernaut of developers, bankers, and politicians and their assumptions about what they deem natural growth and "progress." instead of blaming themselves for their faulty expectations and amending their ways, they rationalize the damages "as proof of a malign and hostile nature" (9) and build on. In other words, we blame nature for intruding maliciously into a certain set of profoundly flawed human choices that are erroneously posited as normal, sane, and right. This mode of thinking proceeds because it is hardwired into the logic of capital, the opposition to which is too scattered, too focused on local rather than regional issues, and too politically naive to deter the juggernaut of developers, bankers, and politicians and their assumptions about what they deem natural growth and "progress." 15 These assumptions turn ideas and language topsy-turvy in support of policies that reflect and perpetuate social inequities and prejudices. Davis ridicules the quixotic desire by residents of coastal Malibu to prevent the wildfires that regularly threaten their homes at the same time that other well-to-do Californians demand to be allowed to construct new houses in the nearby Santa Monica Mountains, which only provide both more fuel and potential sparks to be fanned into an inferno by the Santa Ana winds each autumn. In both instances, the rich take it as a right on their part to build wherever they want, no matter how foolish it is, and maintain that it is an obligation on the part of government to protect them, no matter what the cost. Local officials and agencies have bowed to such views, subsidizing this idiocy and arrogance with heroic (and heroically costly) fire- fighting efforts and by pursuing the wrong-headed notion that the fix is just better equipment and technique, and lots more of that most precious of resources, water. To make matters worse, that's only half of the problem, since the authorities meanwhile neglect the readily remediable problem of tenement fires in the wholly manmade inner city because, after all, these fires only strike the poor and powerless, who usually have dark skins, speak Spanish, or both. Behind all this, according to Davis, is a mind-set which wrongly views periodic wildfire not as part of a natural cycle ex- acerbated by overbuilding, but as the result of carelessness or even arson committed by some hostile social "other" (variously and conveniently rumored, depending on the times and circum- stances, to be a troublemaker, a tramp, an Indian, an Axis sab- oteur, and even an environmentalist). At the same time, this viewpoint accepts tenement fatalities as the way things are. 'Anglo-Californians," he writes, "have always criminalized the problem of mountain wildfire. The majority have never accepted the natural role or inevitability of the chaparral fire cycle. (Con- versely, there has been a persistent tendency to naturalize the</page><page sequence="12">American Literary History 365 strictly human causality of tenement fire)" (132). And so this majority continues to suburbanize the remaining wild areas as the downtown deteriorates; the prosperous risk being burned to death by their own worship of privacy, exclusivity, and property values, the poor by neglect. Davis's modest proposal reflects the kind of rethinking that he knows is inimical to California's devo- tion to development and horror at taxation, especially to support city services for the poor: prescriptive burning in the posh pe- riphery and improved fire prevention and protection in the downtrodden downtown.16 Davis's analysis of the upsurge in attacks by wild animals similarly begins with a simple environmental explanation but moves to a more sinister consideration of the naturalization of race and class bias, as expressed through language. Residential building on the periphery of Los Angeles which he attributes to white flight has given the city what he calls (in another ex- ample of "the most" school of L. A. scholarship) "the longest wild edge, abruptly juxtaposing tract houses and wildlife habitat, of any major nontropical city" (202). Animals that have been evicted from their natural habitats and that now forage around the homes of those who have fled to this area are described by suburbanites as if they were criminals, while young male mem- bers of the underclass the suburbanites have fled are imagined by many influential private citizens and public voices as "predators" in an "urban" wilderness. Thus, "the social construction of na- ture is typically mirrored by the naturalization of purely social contradictions." Davis continues, "Los Angeles's wild edge, in other words, is the place where natural history and social history can sometimes be read as inverted images of each other" (208). When a displaced mountain lion seeking food and water maims a little girl, he is figured as a child molester, i.e., a moral outlaw committing an unnatural act, while the gangbanger is depicted not as a creature of social conditions but an unprovoked wild beast who must be kept safely in a cage, whether it be San Quen- tin or his own blighted neighborhood where he "naturally" be- longs. II This kind of commerce in natural and social metaphor is a familiar phenomenon with many variations. We domesticate hurricanes by giving them human first names (at one time only female names) and express our xenophobia by describing the ar- rival of immigrants as a flood. Wyatt's collapsing of the catego- ries of social turmoil and fire has many precedents. A century ago, business leaders, the mainstream press, and politicians ral- lied public opinion against political radicals and labor organizers by deeming them incendiaries who would burn down modern</page><page sequence="13">366 California, Florida, and the Landscape of Catastrophe civilization, while these same "arsonists" countered that the ex- isting order was itself on fire. One of the ways in which Davis fights the power is by deploying metaphors of natural catastro- phe of his own to make his arguments about modern conditions, a strategy with many antecedents, including in the work of Karl Marx.'8 Davis describes the current development of the hereto- fore relatively untouched Santa Clara Valley as "the final act" in the tragic transformation of Los Angeles's landscape, "a primal scene the familiar tremor heralding an eruption of growth that will wipe away human and natural history. Suburbanization is like another one of Southern California's natural disasters re- current, inexorable" (91). In using such language, however, he implicitly accepts this transformation as a natural force, even as he argues against this way of thinking. While he continues to rail at developers, at times it seems as if he has switched from fighting to mourning, since the battle is already over. In his previous chapters Davis argues that this future was never inevitable, but concrete chances to do better have been repeatedly squandered. Instead of following proposals offered since the turn of the century by humane planners such as Charles Mulford Robinson, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., Harlan Bartho- lomew, Richard Neutra, and Garrett Eckbo to preserve and share L.A.'s "inestimable scenic capital" and develop an environ- mentally aware "alternative urbanism" of sound medium-density housing, common spaces, and regional planning (61), the tri- umph of private interests has resulted in "the total loss of horti- cultural landscape, excessive accumulation of vacant lots, expen- sive utilities and schools, a dramatic imbalance of homes and jobs, minimal community cohesion, and low-density populations transportable only by private cars" (76). In City of Quartz Davis spoke of reclaiming the city's "alternative future" (3), but in Ecol- ogy of Fear he substitutes "lost" for "alternative" (67). The metropolis he describes in his concluding chapter is an apparently unredeemable world where elaborate strategies of ex- clusion and containment, along with an invisible army of poorly paid service workers, underlie the combination of illusion and fear that has made Los Angeles what it is. "The dazzling growth of suburban Southern California," which was once "the incon- testable symbol of national prosperity in the decades between Lend-Lease and Watergate," has thus become the latest and most eloquent example of the end of American exceptionalism: "Now the tables have turned and metropolitan Los Angeles with its estimated 500 gated subdivisions, 2,000 street gangs, 4,000 mini- malls, 20,000 sweatshops, and 100,000 homeless residents is a</page><page sequence="14">American Literary History 367 dystopian symbol of Dickensian inequalities and intractable ra- cial contradictions" (354). This observation expresses what is arguably Davis's main point, on which Wyatt, the authors of Hurricane Andrew, and numerous other cultural critics would appear to concur: the worlds we have made in California and Florida are in their "nor- mal" state the real catastrophe, a fact that is revealed especially vividly when conventional disasters like earthquakes, hurricanes, and mass rioting strike but which is a constant condition. Davis finds support for this view in numerous imaginative texts, which he discusses in his chapter "The Literary Destruction of Los Angeles." The method of this chapter resembles how Wyatt uses literary sources in Five Fires, but it is the least engagingly written section of the book since its taxonomic structure and multiple plot summaries make it much flatter than most of Davis's work, which fairly seems to jump out of the page, grab a fistful of your shirt, and defy you not to pay heed. Even if literary criticism is not his metier, Davis is still to be commended for sorting through a characteristically prodigious number of examples about 100 novels and a few dozen films about Los Angeles in the throes of disaster and for contextualizing them within a much larger fascination with cities in extremis from the Enlightenment to the present. In examining these texts, Davis traces a disturbing trend in which Los Angeles moves from being depicted as the victim of disaster (by an array of cataclysmic events ranging in frequency from nuclear holocaust and earthquakes down to global warm- ing and sandstorms) to the essence of catastrophe itself, so that its obliteration "is often depicted as, or at least secretly experi- enced as, a victory for civilization" (277).19 As much as Davis may regret this attitude, most of Ecology of Fear (and of City of Quartz) provides evidence that it is not misguided. In his last chapter, "Beyond Blade Runner," Davis even gives us a picture of L.A. as suitable bombsite. One of the many photographs, tables, and diagrams in the book is what he calls "an extrapolative map of a future Los Angeles that is already half-born" (363). Inspired by filmmaker Ridley Scott (who directed the film that gives its name to the chapter) and novelists William Gibson and Octavia Butler (notably Gibson's Neuromancer [1984] and Butler's Parable of the Sower [1993]), it is an updating of Chicago School sociolo- gist Ernest W. Burgess's famous 1925 diagram of urban centers as concentric zones defined by the nature of their occupants and the activities that occur within them. "My remapping takes Bur- gess back to the future," Davis explains. "It preserves such 'eco-</page><page sequence="15">368 California, Florida, and the Landscape of Catastrophe logical' determinants as income, land value, class, and race but adds a decisive new factor: fear" (363). At its core is the "Home- less Containment Zone," in the outer rings "Gated Affluent Sub- urbs," and beyond that the "Gulag Rim" of prisons.20 Davis's use of the word fear here and in his title recalls the cultural geographer Yi-Fu Tuan's book Landscapes of Fear (1979), in which Tuan argues, "In a sense, every human construc- tion whether mental or material is a component in a land- scape of fear because it exists to contain chaos" (6). Davis would concur with Tuan's observation, "Every dwelling is a fortress built to defend its human occupants against the elements; it is a constant reminder of human vulnerability.... Generally speak- ing, every human-made boundary on the earth's surface gar- den hedge, city wall, or radar 'fence' is an attempt to keep in- imical forces at bay" (6). Davis (and, to a lesser extent, Wyatt and the contributors to Hurricane Andrew) go a step further, however, to explore the pathological consciousness, the "imagi- nation of catastrophe," that has overdetermined the disastrous world that is Los Angeles, rather than the other way around. The idea that California and Florida are "a disaster" in ways that include but transcend earthquakes, hurricanes, and ri- ots is another notion that is not original to these books or limited to these places. If not in so many words, Didion has made this argument in numerous essays on both California and Miami.21 As Davis himself points out in "The Literary Destruction of Los Angeles" and in his description of the contemporary city as "Dickensian," since at least the nineteenth century many main- stream as well as lesser-known writers have drawn similar conclu- sions about London, New York, and other cities. One can argue that the integration of the catastrophic into the idea of the nor- mal is a major thread in the history of the development of first the modern and then the postmodern sensibility. Without getting into a discussion of the distinctions between, and the varieties of, both modernism and postmodernism, one can say that both of these sensibilities variously greet what they view as the inher- ently disastrous quality of contemporary life as a desperate turn of events and as having an edgy energy. The imagination of disaster itself has been so internalized that it has become an almost automatic response to a host of things. We apply it in offhand ways to numerous aspects of con- temporary life, not just indisputable disasters like a major earth- quake in a densely settled area or the latest atrocity attributable to racial and religious enmity. It sometimes seems as if every- thing, from the school and transportation systems to the state of</page><page sequence="16">American Literary History 369 civility to the rising but somehow always still acceptable level of pesticides in green beans, is referred to dismissively and fatalisti- cally as "a disaster."22 This attitude has been qualified in popular rhetoric in this country with the economic boom of the late 1990s, the decline in homicide and other violent crimes, and the revival of several urban downtowns, though many would con- tend that none of these has measurably improved the lives of the poor and powerless. What Davis wants to remind us is that the intrusion of the catastrophic into everyday life is tragic and not trivial. And it is the things that most people would call the triumphs of places like California and Florida that are the most catastrophic, for, until the wrong thinking behind them is corrected, they will lead to only more foolishness, disappointment, injustice, and misery. The floods, earthquakes, and tornadoes he so vividly describes, the mountain lions rummaging through the dumpsters, are symptoms of the problem and not the malady itself, which is the whole cosmology that has created this bizarre Disneyland of denial. In this respect his work is heir to two other traditions. The first is the long history of critics of the existing order who seized on the opportunity presented by terrible events to alter or over- throw the hierarchy of power and ideas. A notable example here is Voltaire's deployment of the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 to question the prevailing mood of confident optimism in this best of all possible worlds.23 As many others have remarked, Davis's relentless account of a long litany of recent Los Angeles disasters falls even more into another time-honored genre, the jeremiad, which is both more despairing and more hopeful than Voltaire. Like the railings of Old Testament prophecy, Davis's sermonizing derives its authority from close observation, outrage, and tough love for the damned.24 Perhaps more than he would like to admit, Davis sees the disasters that have been visited on Los Angeles in essentially moral terms, as signs of a broken covenant, our willful abandonment of a better way of living in relation to each other and to nature in a promised land. Southern California and all it stands for, in Davis's view, seem to validate the valedictory of the darkest work of Mark Twain (in whose career, after all, Califor- nia, as well as life on the Mississippi, was a formative experi- ence), when his Mysterious Stranger declares that we inhabit only the world we imagine, and the worst thing that can be said about us is that, given such limitless opportunity, what we have dreamed up is "frankly and hysterically insane" (404).</page><page sequence="17">370 California, Florida, and the Landscape of Catastrophe Notes 1. The disappointments experienced by newcomers when California and Flor- ida have failed to live up to expectations have long been a compelling literary subject, masterfully chronicled in this century by writers as diverse and distinct as Nathanael West (The Day of the Locust [1939]) and Russell Banks (Continen- tal Drift [1985]). 2. For one of the most noted explorations of this supposition, see Kai T. Erik- son's study of the 1972 Buffalo Creek, West Virginia, flood in Everything in Its Path. Destruction of the Community in the Buffalo Creek Flood (1976). 3. Davis defiantly begins his acknowledgments in City of Quartz by declaring, "There are no research grants, sabbaticals, teaching assistants, or other fancy ingredients in this fare...." He has, however, since been awarded a MacArthur "genius" grant and has been a fellow at the Getty Institute. Davis has also taught urban theory at the Southern California Institute of Architecture, and he has presented his work frequently at numerous universities and study centers. 4. Davis and the controversies he has provoked have received the kind of ma- jor coverage that many academics would die for, understandably in the Los Angeles Times and other L.A.-based publications, but also in the New York Times, the Economist, Business Week, the Nation, Lingua Franca, and the online magazine Salon. A major source of commentary on Davis is available through H-Urban, the urban history list, at http://www.unimelb.edu.au/infoserv/urban/ hma/hurban/. Enter "Mike" and "Davis" in the search engine. 5. Davis makes a related argument in Ecology of Fear: "During the first cen- tury of Los Angeles's existence, its regional economy was largely based upon the comprehensive looting and destruction of [its] extraordinary biological en- dowment" (212). 6. With sustained winds of 145 m.p.h. and gusts stronger than that, Andrew was the third most intense hurricane ever to strike the mainland US. The storm devastated an area approximately the size of Chicago. It damaged 8,000 busi- nesses and 108,000 private residences (with almost half rendered uninhabi- table), leaving 180,000 people homeless, destroying the local infrastructure, and running up a tab in excess of 28 billion dollars. Some other figures: 1.4 million people without electricity, 150,000 homes without telephones, 3,300 miles of power line destroyed, all but nine of 6,600 trailers or mobile homes in South Dade County wiped out. The one thankfully low figure is the 15 recorded fatali- ties. Had Andrew made landfall only 20 miles farther north, at the center of the most populated section of Dade County, all these numbers would have been considerably higher. 7. Hurricane Andrew attributes less blame for damages to careless building than does Ecology of Fear. Citing expert testimony, Morrow states that al- though "there were problems with Dade County's building codes necessitating that they be revised to deal with new building materials and construction tech- nologies, at the time of Hurricane Andrew, Dade had the strongest wind-related building codes in the country." The same expert concluded that while "[c]ode</page><page sequence="18">American Literary History 371 violations and shoddy construction practices have been highly touted as con- tributing to the damage, . . . it is now estimated that they accounted for less than 10 per cent of the losses" (8). For a more skeptical view, see "Storm Over South Florida Building Codes" (1999). 8. Davis has frequently been compared to Carey McWilliams, author of nu- merous studies of California, including Southern California Country: An Island on the Land, first published in 1946. As a Marxist critique of the built environ- ment in the city and of the urban consciousness, Davis's work is also related to that of David Harvey. See, for example, Harvey's The Urbanization of Capital (1985) and Consciousness and Urban Experience (1986), companion volumes in his Studies in the History and Theory of Capitalist Urbanization. These have been combined and abridged into a single volume titled The Urban Experi- ence (1989). 9. Ethington's remarks appear in a well-known 1998 review in Southern Cali- fornia Quarterly of Allen J. Scott and Edward W Soja's edited collection, The City. Los Angeles and Urban Theory at the End of the Twentieth Century (1996), which includes an essay by Davis that would become a chapter of Ecology of Fear. Ethington highly recommends much of the book as first-class scholarship, aiming most of his criticism at what he deems bombastic claims by postmodem urban theorists (notably Soja), a category in which he does not put Davis. Ethington, who advocates a comparatist approach, expresses concern "about the baleful tendencies of a new crop of Los Angeles boosters, who ... have been clamoring too loudly with too little evidence for conferring special status on Los Angeles and the need for new models" (350). He attributes this tendency to "a deep insecurity that the world may not pay enough attention to Los Angeles, will not take it seriously, and that Los Angeles may never join the exclusive club of great U.S. metropolises-especially New York City and Chi- cago" (354). This insecurity is itself also nothing new, even in regard to boasting about catastrophe. Some of nineteenth-century Chicago's legendary army of boosters, discontented with their "second city" status well before the term was coined, treated the great fire of 1871 as a blessing in disguise since it helped put their town on the map. Ethington's main complaint about Davis, whose prose he calls "brilliant" and whom he describes as "becoming the Rabelais of Los Angeles," is that his writing has become formulaic and that his evidence is indeed sometimes questionable and thin (360-61). Ethington's review has been cited by some of the harsher critics of Davis's politics, to whom Ethington has rejected any con- nection. In a posting to the online discussion on Davis, Ethington expressed sympathy with Davis's politics but voiced concern that his sloppiness did not help advance the cause. "Casual, incomplete, or cavalier citations are deeply problematic in scholarly discourse, and especially so when the author is making huge, dramatic claims. And further, we on the Left are betrayed when these gaffes allow the Right to devalue Davis's overall project, which I have been supporting for many years now. Effective radical scholarship must be factually unassailable, or else Malibu realtors with pseudonyms and axes to grind can topple the whole edifice of progressive social science" ("Re"). 10. For a recent study of Miami that discusses the local culture in terms, if not a tone, analogous to Davis's reading of Los Angeles, see Alejandro Portes and Alex Stepick, City on the Edge: The Transformation of Miami (1993).</page><page sequence="19">372 California, Florida, and the Landscape of Catastrophe 11. On the politics of rebuilding following disasters, see also Christine Meisner Rosen, The Limits of Power: Great Fires and the Process of City Growth in America (1986), and Judd Kahn, Imperial San Francisco: Politics and Plan- ning in an American City, 1897-1906 (1983). In his online review of Ecology of Fear for H-Urban, Jared Orsi's main criticism is of what he calls the "oddly ahistorical" nature of Davis's book. 12. For a well-known discussion of this subject, see Hayden White, "Introduc- tion: Tropology, Discourse, and the Modes of Human Consciousness," in Trop- ics of Discourse: Essays in Cultural Criticism (1978) (3, 5). 13. Wyatt discusses, for example, his father's recollections of the collapse of the St. Francis Dam in 1928, which also figures in one of Wyatt's texts, the motion picture Chinatown (1974). 14. For one of several recent discussions of this point, see William Cronon's "Introduction: In Search of Nature" (1995). Nature, Cronon writes, is not as "natural" as it seems. "Instead, it is a profoundly human construction. This is not to say that the nonhuman world is somehow unreal or a mere figment of our imaginations-far from it. But the way we describe and understand that world is so entangled with our own values and assumptions that the two can never be fully separated" (25). See Raymond Williams's reflections on this ques- tion in "Ideas of Nature" (1982) and, for an immense-and immensely rich- consideration of this proposition in relation to literature and art, see Simon Schama's Landscape and Memory (1995). 15. Donald Worster is one of a group of scholars who make a similar argu- ment about irrigation policies in arid regions of the American West, which he describes in Rivers of Empire: Water, Aridity, and the Growth of the American West (1985) as "a culture and society built on, and absolutely dependent on, a sharply alienating, intensely managerial relationship with nature" (5), a social order that is "increasingly a coercive, monolithic, and hierarchical system, ruled by a power elite based on the ownership of capital and expertise" (7). Worster's description of the world that has arisen by the irrigation ditch is simi- lar to Davis's characterization of Los Angeles: "There is little peace or tidiness or care, little sense of a rooted community. There is no equitable sharing of prosperity. The human presence here often seems very much like the tumble- weeds that have been caught in the barbed-wire fences: impermanent, drifting, snagged for a while, drifting again, without grace or character, liable to blow away with a blast of hot desert wind." Among the many other explorations of this subject, see also Marc Reisner's Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water (1986). 16. Hurricane Andrew makes a similar suggestion. Chris Gerard and Walter Gillis Peacock explore how residential segregation impedes postdisaster reloca- tion efforts, "thereby compounding the problems of vulnerable communities" (203). The proper response in a socially flawed society, they suggest, is the one that Davis proposes when he speaks of how much more attention is paid to fighting fires in Malibu than in tenements downtown: disaster planners must reverse current practices and concentrate on the special vulnerability of the poor. No one appears to think that this is politically likely, however. The most poignant of the entries in Hurricane Andrew is the study by Peacock, Morrow,</page><page sequence="20">American Literary History 373 and Nicole Dash comparing how much more attention and resources the com- munity of Homestead commanded after the storm than its poorer and blacker neighbor, Florida City, which "provides a case study of how incorporated pock- ets of neglect at the lowest rungs of an urban stratification system can have as much to do with disaster difficulties as the event itself." Observing that "Florida City was unequally impacted by the hurricane," that "its recovery progress has been more sluggish," and that "its future appears more tenuous," the authors conclude that while this community was on "the edge of poverty" before the disaster, "Hurricane Andrew may well have blown it over the brink" (206). 17. "Too often," Davis writes, "wildness is equated with urban disorder, and wild animals end up as the symbolic equivalents of street criminals; or con- versely, they acquire all the psychopathic connotations of sentimentalized pets or surrogate people. The Otherness of wild animals is the gestalt which we are constantly refashioning in the image of our own urban confusion and alien- ation. Where nature is most opaquely unknowable, as in the 'character' of ani- mals, we intensely crave the comfort of anthropomorphic definition and catego- rization. And where it is the human world that threatens, this impulse is mirrored in our desire to give our fears shape: as beasts" (267). The naturaliza- tion of disaster is a common strategy of defenders of the status quo. For a discussion in these terms of the first official responses to the disproportionately high mortality rate among low-income elderly African Americans living alone during the terrible heat wave in Chicago in the summer of 1995, for example, see Eric Klinenberg, "Denaturalizing Disaster: A Social Autopsy of the 1995 Chicago Heat Wave" (1999). 18. Marshall Berman observes in All That Is Solid Melts into Air: The Experi- ence of Modernity (1988) that "[o]ne of Marx's most urgent aims" is to get his readers to feel the catastrophic nature of the times; "this is why his ideas are expressed in such intense and extravagant images-abysses, earthquakes, volca- nic eruptions, crushing gravitational force-images that will continue to reso- nate in our own century's modernist art and thought" (19). 19. Davis attributes this response-evident, for example, in what he sees as the "comic undertone of 'good riddance"' when representative members of Los Angeles's kook culture are vaporized in the 1996 box office smash, Independence Day (277)-to a widely shared view of the city today as dystopia, and he per- suasively connects this to the same kind of racist fears that drive earlier surviv- alist fantasies about the destruction of London and New York (e.g., Ignatius Donnelly's 1890 novel Caesar's Column). "After 1970," he observes, "with the rise of a non-Anglo majority in Los Angeles County, the city turns from an endangered home into the Alien itself; and its destruction affords an illicit plea- sure not always visible in previous annihilations." He maintains that the "white fear of the dark races" that "lies at the heart of such visions" has a heuris- tic value, since "far more than anxieties about earthquakes or nuclear weap- ons . . . [this obsession] leads us back to the real Los Angeles as well as to the deepest animating fears of our culture" (281-82). The view of American cities as "alien" is, of course, hardly unprecedented, going back at least as far as Jefferson's famous critique, later transformed and intensified in nativist politics from the antebellum period onward. As Davis himself points out, Los Angeles is hardly the only American city depicted this way in American popular culture. In the 1999 film The Matrix, for instance, the unreal nightmare city of the future is Chicago.</page><page sequence="21">374 California, Florida, and the Landscape of Catastrophe 20. Burgess's diagram appears in "The Growth of the City: An Introduction to a Research Project," in Robert E. Park, Ernest W Burgess, and Roderick McKenzie's 1967 classic collection of essays, The City (55). 21. In Miami, Didion writes-much as Davis does concerning Los Angeles- about the local obsession with personal security amidst her title city's own "ecology of fear." She discusses how the police's referring to break-ins as "home invasions" suggests "a city under systematic siege" (25), and she mentions be- ing warned by white friends-unjustifiably, as it turned out-of all the places she must not go and all the precautions she must take "in the territory of the disentitled" (39). "I never passed through security for a flight to Miami," Didion writes, "without experiencing a certain weightlessness, the heightened wariness of having left the developed world for a more fluid atmosphere, one in which the native distrust of extreme possibilities that tended to ground the temperate United States in an obeisance to democratic institutions seemed rooted, if at all, only shallowly" (23). Didion is, of course, better known for her dark vision of her native California as a cultural chaos made up of broken dreams that were fatally flawed in the first place, expressed in her fiction and her essays, which have been collected in such books as Slouching Toward Bethle- hem (1968) and The White Album (1979). For a brilliantly dead-on anatomy by a lifelong resident of a blue-collar suburban southern California that is part of the history of development that Davis condemns, see D. J. Waldie's Holy Land. A Suburban Memoir (1996). 22. This is to be distinguished from the view that sees modern capitalism as fashioning a world characterized by constant destruction and rebuilding. For a remarkably insightful consideration of this view, see Berman. For its applica- bility to New York and Chicago, respectively, see Max Page, The Creative De- struction of Manhattan, 1900-1940 (1999); and Ross Miller, American Apoca- lypse: The Great Fire and the Myth of Chicago (1990). 23. In his classic study of the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, T. D. Kendrick ex- amines this cataclysm in relation to Voltaire's scornful attack on optimism. See Chapter 7, "Optimism Attacked." 24. Sacvan Bercovitch's deservedly noted The American Jeremiad (1978) ex- amines the centrality of the jeremiad in national life well beyond seventeenth- century Puritanism. His discussion of the peculiar mixture of desperation and affirmation in the jeremiad certainly applies to Davis, though different readers might argue pro and con whether Davis's vision of a socialist alternative in- volves what Bercovitch calls "a refusal to confront the present, a fear of the future, an effort to translate 'America' into a vision that works in spirit because it can never be tested in fact" (xiv). In Disaster and the Millennium (1974), Michael Barkun similarly explores the vital role of catastrophe in millennial thought. "Disaster produces the questioning, the anxiety, and the suggestibility that are required," Barkun writes; "only in its wake are people moved to aban- don the values of the past and place their faith in prophecies of imminent and total transformation" (6).</page><page sequence="22">American Literary History 375 Works Cited Barkun, Michael.
