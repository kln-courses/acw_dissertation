<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARILYN IVY The Art of Cute Little Things: Nara Yoshitomo's Parapolitics In the beginning was, is, the word: fan . What is a fan? I refer to the Oxford English Dictionary , which I often do in such moments: it tells us that fan comes from fanatic (it is surprising how many people don't realize this origin). Whereas the OED does list a 1682 precursor ("The Loyal Phans to abuse"), not until the turn of the twentieth century does fan emerge as an Ameri- can transformation of fanatic , referring to "a keen and regular supporter of a (professional) sports team" (originally, the OED states, baseball). From there it was not a big transformation for fan to morph into a "keen follower of a specified hobby or amusement" and thence to indicate "an enthusiast for a particular person or thing."1 Then, we might ask, what is a fanatic? The OED tells us that as an adjec- tive, fanatic meant that which "might result from possession by a deity or demon; frantic, furious"; "Frenzied; mad." Furthermore, the fanatic is "char- acterized, influenced, or prompted by excessive and mistaken enthusiasm"; she is an "unreasoning enthusiast."2 The excessive, the unreasoning, the enthusiastic, and the mistaken: these, then, are some of the semantic dimensions of the fan that haunt its history. In the fan's singular obsession with a mistaken object - one that ©</page><page sequence="2">somehow inappropriately, and excessively, stands in for healthier, normal object choices - we hear more than a suggestion of the notion of the fetish.3 The affect of the fan - devoted enthusiasm - is here combined with a ques- tion mark appended to the object of that (inappropriate) enthusiasm. In its indication of the phenomenon of possession, the OED reveals how affect and object exchange substance; the body of the fanatic is caught up in a frenzy of identification with the object of his devotion, such that the deity takes over the fanatics very being. The excessiveness of the fans enthusiasm is bound to result in a mistaken object of affection; conversely, the very mistakenness of the object is tied to the mistaken enthusiasm of the fan. In either or both cases, the social abnormality of the fan-object relation is staged. Perhaps nowhere more so than in Japan has the fan figure, with its in- carnation in the otaku, been pushed to the extremes of mass cultural fascina- tion. The stereotypical otaku figure displays an intense intimacy with mass- mediated fan objects; a highly developed connoisseurship of animated minu- tiae; a solitary mode of being, yet accompanied by absorptions into virtual sociality (with forms of convening and movement that bespeak new modes of communication); and something akin to fetishism, in which small objects of desire come to stand in for the larger, more totalized sexual relationships that are designated as normal and good.4 We might think of the otaku fig- ure as embodying the core contradiction of the fan figure in general: big pas- sion, little object (often literalized in the otakus attraction to and passion for minutely specified elements of aesthetic form - the color of an animated figure's hair, for example, or the cats ears a character displays: elemental provocations of desire, elements of moe, to use the Japanese word).5 The otaku-child figure, lost to normal sociality, sexuality, and national- cultural identification, has thus been refunctioned in academic and aesthetic discourses as the most appropriate sign for the strange fate of the Japanese nation-state and its peculiar history: defeated in World War II, bombed atomically (the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was called "Little Boy"), and dominated by the looming, fraternally sinister, yet comforting presence of the United States. To many, the otaku figure has seemed to encapsulate all-too-perfectly the infantilization and impotence of the Japanese nation- state and its mass culture in the wake of Japans defeat in 1945.6 But the otaku figure is merely the most publicly available and capitalized-on object of national-cultural anxieties about youth and national futurity. Primarily gendered male, otaku find their mass-cultural counterparts in the objecti- fied persona of shojo (young girl), a word indicating a subject position that is primarily female but can be affectively shared by either gender (shojo 4 MARILYN IVY</page><page sequence="3">indicates a psychically open space epitomized by the "adolescent girl" not yet fully appropriated by the socio-sexual order).7 With their everyday commod- ity desires for the kawaii (cute) and for the tender, whimsical, and romantic affective worlds that embody cuteness, shojo have become the theoretical counterparts of otaku. How do the large obsessions of fans and the smallness of ludic objects, cuteness and weirdness, the child and the adult work together in contempo- rary Japanese art? That is a question I want to explore by looking at the works of Nara Yoshitomo.

The resolutely nondigital and hand- crafted visual styles of Nara are at the opposite end of the spectrum from the high-gloss digital artworks of Murakami Takashi, Japans most famous contemporary artist (Nara would be a close second). Yet, as we know, the two artists have collaborated on many works, have had joint exhibitions, shared interviews, and have a long-term working friendship (although it is said that the friendship is no longer viable). There is even a Web site called "Narakami" that sells their products (it assures its readers that Murakami and Nara are "good friends").8 Murakami has worked to theorize his art and has incorpo- rated Naras works in his larger theory of Japanese art, which he has termed "Superflat." In engaging "Superflat" visuality and its relationship to the gaze and the figure of the child, we can begin to grasp the fan appeal of Naras works and their powers of attraction. THE ART OF CUTE LITTLE THINGS 5</page><page sequence="4">So first, Murakami: he came to international attention with his exhibition entitled "Superflat," held in Japan in 2000 and subsequently staged in the United States in 2001. Murakamis essay "Superflat Manifesto," which opened the catalogue for the exhibitions, presented a distinctive theory of Japanese art. Saturated by the techno-aesthetics of Japanese anime in particular and mass-cultural energies in general, Superflat art is premised on a digitally con- stituted world, one in which a multiplicity of perspectives and planar surfaces coexist without the privileging of any one perspective or plane.9 Superflat connotes much more than the visual, however. For Murakami, it also connotes the resolute flattening of distinctions between popular cul- ture and any form of high culture. And even though Superflat is most closely associated with contemporary postdigital aesthetics, Murakami is invested in theorizing a lineage of Japanese aesthetics, a particular stream of artis- tic production that has emphasized the movement of the eye across decora- tive, metamorphosing, playful surfaces. It is an aesthetic that fundamentally overflows and displaces canonical distinctions between high and low art and much else in the name of a singularly imagined Japanese visual and cultural regime. Among those hierarchies that Superflat art displaces - or claims to displace - is the familiar one that includes the adult and the child. It is this Superflat placement of the child that I want to take up here, starting with the very notion of the subject itself and its relationship to vision. In his important essay entitled "Super Flat Speculation," which functions as a companion essay to Murakamis "Super Flat Manifesto," the philosopher Azuma Hiroki uses the work of Jacques Lacan to theorize the work of the gaze, or the play of gazes, in Superflat aesthetics. As Azuma explains: "I look at you. You look at me. And it is the interaction of our gazes . . . that provides us with the sense that we share the same space, that we occupy a common 'there."'10 The creation of this effect is produced through the "use of linear perspective and the interaction of gaze."11 Azuma then argues that linear per- spective - which conjures a sense of reality by having lines of sight converge on a central vanishing point, thus producing a unified sense of space - is a socially constructed perspective that "requires the suppression of the child- ish sensibility that would see instead an accumulation of independent objects . . . each an image with which to be empathized individually."12 Again, Azuma: "A child sees something, and in so doing feels desire. But the child has no conception of 'the self looking at something/ Simply put, the child is unaware of the relativity of its own perspective. Lacan understood this state as lacking an awareness of gaze" This suppression of the childs unself-conscious, visu- ally polymorphous sensibility, this abandonment of the omnipotent realm of 6 MARILYN IVY</page><page sequence="5">A 90WTARV CHILE?

The child may be charmed by im- ages, but the adult is conscious of 'f the gaze."18 The child must abandon the realm of images, of the omnipotence of its desire, to enter into the (adult) realm of die social. Murakami's work embodies this relationship between the child and vision by his incessant mo- tifs of anime-like eyes throughout his art, eyes that are "signs of eyes," in Azuma's formulation. Nara Yoshitomo's work embodies a different relationship to die child and to the gaze. A solitary child is suspended within an indeterminate, muted background; the child is alone and lonely, concurrently tender and violent, adorable and perverse: this is the archetypical scene in a Nara painting. Nara's work has been compared to that of Balthus; others see it as evoking out- sider art, or children's art itself, in its use of simple lines and deformations.14 Sketches and drawings, the forms that Nara has consistently valorized (even in his highly finished paintings, the emphasis on drawing remains), have com- monly been regarded as preparatory to painting as the summa of the artistic process; thus, drawings are canonically considered incomplete, in process, developmental, characteristics that are easily mapped onto the figure of the child in process, an entity ever metamorphosing.15 Texts and pictures some- times overlap, with a proliferation of works made up of scrawls on envelopes, scribbles on brown paper, and pages torn from notebooks. Ihese remind one of the illicit drawings of a child at school, transgressive and furtive. They are all resolutely undigital. They all evoke an aesthetics of the fragment. In their fragmentation and in their elevation of drawing, again, they evoke the minor, the occasional, the spontaneous, the misfit (thus Nara's many references, im- plicit and explicit, to punk rock), and the child: theme, style, and medium re- capitulate one another (Figure i).18 And with exceptions and elaborations - Nara's work is more diverse than is sometimes acknowledged - his signature characters, the ones that seem to exemplify this aesthetic more than others, are the glaring, large-eyed girl children of his iconic portraits, strange permu- tations of the round-eyed iiber-aite girls of manga and anime renown. Do Nara's children lack the gaze of Murakami's anime characters? These children do not have the anime eyes that Murakami produces, the signs of THE ART OF CUTE LITTLE THINGS 7</page><page sequence="6">figure i. Nara Yoshitomo, Fight It Out , 2002. Courtesy of Marianne Boesky Gallery, New York. eyes, as Azuma describes them, within fields of superflattened digital repeti- tion. Yet, the eyes have it in Naras work. They are a recurrent motif, with a recurrent signature shape: elongated, narrowed, a flattened ellipse (a black half-circle works as an analog of the iris; a smaller olive-colored half-circle operates as the pupil). Here we don't feel so much the pulling of the gaze over 8 MARILYN IVY</page><page sequence="7">the plane of the work, of the morphing of forms into one another, as the pull- ing of our gaze toward the eyes of Nara's children. The eyes of these child fig- ures function as repositories of smoldering affect. Most famously, they glare. Sometimes they look sad, other times frustrated. Rarely do they present an unmediated happy face. It is as if Nara reinstates the gaze presumed to be missing in the promiscuous vision of Superflat art, thus providing an uneasy supplement to Murakami's anime-inspired "signs of eyes" (Figure 2). Following Lacan via Azuma, we might say that Murakami's signature work is in the domain of the imaginary, of a pre-oedipal, unfettered pro- miscuity of infant vision, while Nara's reinstates the post-oedipal child, the child who has already found itself abandoned within the symbolic order. Nara gives back something that Murakami forecloses. He gives back the lack that lacks in Murakami - and that might signal the ultimately horrific dimension of Murakami's serially repetitive eyes - in the register of loss, figured by the vulnerable yet aggressive children in his work. He locates a range of affects that Murakami does not provide. His characters are epitomes of perverse children, sometimes clutching knives or smoking cigarettes, with oversized heads and narrowed, elongated eyes. Nara's solitary children are somehow outside the social at the same time that they seem to have borne prematurely the burdens of the socio-symbolic order. They upset the developmental tem- porality that the child must traverse on its road to normalcy (Figure 3).17 Their eyes, if not precisely anime-like, do not provide the realist instan- tiation of the gaze that classic Western portraiture would provide, either (and here the famous example of Hans Holbein's painting The Ambassadors, which Lacan discusses - and Azuma takes up - as exemplifying the intersec- tion of gazes constitutive of one-point perspective and the form of subjec- tivity the results from this perspective). Typically, these child figures don't look directly at the viewer, and when they do look frontally, their eyes don't leave the impression of a reciprocal gaze. Their vision is oblique, fixed on the middle distance; even the objects they often hold fail to fix their gazes. Nara's affective visions course through the figure of the traumatized child (we could say "the castrated subject"), yet the "castrated" space of vision here does not constitute one of perspectivally reciprocal, intersubjective space. Instead, in the obliquity of their regard, the little child figures - glaring out into the dis- tance but not composed to intersect with the gaze of the viewer - seem to reveal a traumatic encounter with the Real; at the same time, their aggres- sion is not directed to any one point of blame or appeal. Their eyes, "looking awry," seem to be fixed on some anamorphic spot, some blot that has caused them to become preternaturally worldly: traumatized children, yet children THE ART OF CUTE LITTLE THINGS 9</page><page sequence="8">figure 2.

Thus, they often float out of or stand in indeterminate space, a kind of creepy (some would say dreamy) pastel background, featureless and encroach- ing (in person, one can see the impeccably polished finish of the backgrounds of these often enormous paintings). Sometimes the child stands waist deep in a dark puddle of nothingness that extends in every direction to the edges of the painting. This formless surround of the indeterminate becomes the con- dition for their semi-emergence as subjects, at the same time that it threat- ens to engulf them. They smoke cigarettes, hold knives (and paintbrushes), and clearly can wound (and are wounded, repeatedly), yet their tough stances 10 MARILYN IVY</page><page sequence="9">figure 3.

Courtesy of Tomio Koyama Gallery, Tokyo. and glares rarely attain the status of unalloyed malevolence (although the child in Naras painting The Little Judge comes close) (Figure 4). We might regard these children as suspended subjects, subjects in for- mation. To paint a child as a subject is to suspend or stop time at a moment when the body-being is at its most transformative; the child virtually embod- ies the principle of change and metamorphosis. If paintings of children tend to focus on their innocence and purity, it is precisely to foreground a much- desired transitory perfection and their aesthetic protection from the forces of inevitable growth, and thus the loss of childhood itself. Naras children are not playing; they are not set within worlds of growth and movement. They are not located within family (certainly not), with friends, with any Other at THE ART OF CUTE LITTLE THINGS 11</page><page sequence="10">figure 4. Nara Yoshitomo, The Little Judge, 2001. Courtesy of Tomio Koyama Gallery, Tokyo. all. They are resolutely alone, literally conveying the sense of loneliness that Nara constantly references in his writings and interviews. Nara himself has spoken of the "pure evil" of these children, not with- out a certain wryness, one must assume. In 2005, my then-seven-year-old daughter accompanied me to Hawaii for the opening of Nara's solo exhibi- tion "Nothing Ever Happens" at The Contemporary Museum in Honolulu. I had been asked to give a lecture on Nara and related themes as part of the exhibition activities, and so my daughter had been introduced to the world of 12 MARILYN IVY</page><page sequence="11">Nara. Rather than charming or engaging this seven-year-old, Nara's children repelled and annoyed her. Calling them "disgusting children," she produced a surprisingly coherent and impassioned series of reflections on Naras work, saying that he saw children as evil, that he didn't understand children. She asked me if Nara "hated" children. "Real children aren't like that," she said. "Its kind of insulting to children." "Don't you think they're cute?" I asked her, leadingly. "There's nothing cute about them," she insisted. Rather than lingering on the irony that Nara's child figures completely put off a real child (revealing that this art is not produced with children as its intended audience), I want to remark the intensity of the affect that Nara's work evoked in my daughter. When such strong affect is elicited, there's sure to be some kind of (over)identification at work, such that the object becomes the externalized locus of, in this case, negativity. I was not innocent in asking my daughter if she thought his children were cute, because that is the fundamental operative term that is used in assessing Nara's work, both critically and affirmatively. It is perhaps surprising that the minor aesthetic concept of the cute could even provoke such affect in either its positive or negative aspect (so what if it's not cute?). When my daughter denied that there was anything at all cute about Nara's work, she was attempting to fend off the insult to the world of children, her world, that such a perversion of the cute would imply - implying as well that Nara's children were all too cute for comfort. Here, then, we might want to linger further on the cute - the kawaii - it- self, as it becomes such a crucial aesthetic term for thinking about Nara's work, and indeed, for much of contemporary art and everyday culture. The origins of kawaii had to do with pity or empathy for a small or helpless creature - archetypically, a child or infant. At its inception, then, the notion of the cute is entirely wrapped up in the relationship to the child figure as the epitome of vulnerability and helplessness (and thus kawaii is closely linked to the notion of kawaiso, or "pitiful").19 There is no doubt that kawaii is gendered feminine, with women and girls linked, as they are in many societies, with children (and, yes, with little animals). From the 1960s on, kawaii s implication of pitifulness and helplessness expanded, under the pressure of mass-cultural proliferations of new categories of taste to what it came to mean in the United States: a posi- tive aesthetic descriptor of things pert, neat, appealing, attractive, and engag- ing but not heavy, glamorous, massive, or overwhelming. There is always a dimension of vulnerability, smallness, and - indeed - (feminized) childish- ness attending the kawaii. THE ART OF CUTE LITTLE THINGS 13</page><page sequence="12">Yet, of course, "Iheres nothing cute about them." In a brilliant essay, Sianne Ngai has taken on the cute - as well as the kawaii, which in its modern form is close to the English-language notion of cute - in asking how such a commercially elaborated notion came, in an inverse fashion, to influence avant-garde works of art. The differences are, of course, immense: "While the avant-garde is conventionally imagined as sharp and pointy, as hard- or cutting-edge, cute objects have no edge to speak of, usually being soft, round, and deeply associated with the infantile and the feminine."20 Yet she uncov- ers unsettling similarities between the resistant ineffectually of avant-garde art in the midst of capitalized mass culture and the minor aesthetic concept of the cute: the avant-garde text often "thematizes and formally reflects . . . the oscillation between domination and passivity, or cruelty and tenderness, uniquely brought forward by the aesthetic of cuteness."21 Both the avant- garde work and the cute object as modern phenomena ("cute" really devel- oped as a standard taste concept in mass-cultural society), as articulations with commodity culture, embody an extreme powerlessness that can turn over into its opposite: resistant testimony to the violence of domination. The cute object is, she says, the most "reified or thinglike of things, the most ob- jectified of objects,"22 and the extremity of that objectification is precisely the fundament of the potential resistance of cuteness. Commercial cuteness depends on pliability and softness: the cute ob- ject "invites physical touching"23 at the same time that it shows how central anthropomorphism is, such that objects are given faces and, typically, large eyes. For Ngai, the "smaller and less formally articulated or more bloblike the object, the cuter it becomes - in part because smallness and blobbishness suggest greater malleability and thus a greater capacity for being handled."24 From there, she argues, it's not difficult to see how these "formal" properties of the cute object elicit particular affects. Softness, roundness, squishiness, and simplicity are important, because, as she continues, it is crucial to cuteness that its diminutive object has some sort of imposed- upon aspect or mien - that is, that it bears the look of an object not only formed but all too easily de-formed under the pressure of the subject's feel- ing or attitude toward it . . . We can thus start to see how cuteness might provoke ugly or aggressive feelings, as well as the expected tender or mater- nal ones. For in its exaggerated passivity and vulnerability, the cute object is as often intended to excite a consumers sadistic desires for mastery and control as much as his or her desire to cuddle.25 14 MARILYN IVY</page><page sequence="13">The movement of a child or a toy out of its domain of cuteness and pas- sivity, of innocence under the control of the parental superego, is one of the most disturbing events imaginable. The cute, in its very vulnerability, inevi- tably entails the uncanny (bukimi, as one standard Japanese word used to translate the "uncanny" indicates). In "The "Uncanny/" Freud attempted to account for unpleasant affects and untoward effects in the domain of art, ones that couldn't be included within the classic domains of the beautiful or the sublime. His essay took up one such minor aesthetico-affective experi- ence in literature: that of the "uncanny" (unheimlich) . What is the uncanny, Freud asked, and how are uncanny effects produced in literature (and sec- ondarily, in life)? The core twist of the work, the memorably important key to understanding the essay, lies in the very term itself: unheimlich. Freud shows how the unheimlich - the uncanny - emerges etymologically from its exact opposite, from the heimlich : the intimate, the homely, the private. Through a process of slippage, a word that designates the most homelike and friendly affect turns into its ugly opposite: the weird, the eerie, the decidedly not homey. In a doubling that is characteristic of the entire essay on the uncanny, the most uncanny experience of all is having a word turn into its opposite; a word that means everything homelike and intimate becomes urchomelike (unheimlich) , alienated and, well, uncanny. The very notion of the unheimlich is itself unheimlich. We are now in a position to see even more clearly what Nara's child paint- ings are staging. His signature paintings of "evil" children are deformations of the cute; they reproduce many of the conventions - big heads, roundness, softness, squishability, wide eyes - but in a version that has been, precisely, squeezed and compressed by the deformational technique of the artist. The modal requirements of the kawaii have been pushed past the limits of vulner- able malleability, disclosing the aggressive dimension always implicit in the cutified aesthetic relationship. These works of Nara stage, in turn, the recipro- cal resistance of the cute, its "imposed-upon aspect or mien" that reveals the "pressure of the subjects feeling or attitude toward it."26 The undecidability of the difference between the kawaii and the bukimi (Is it cute? Is it creepy?) is itself uncanny. But an element of pathos strongly inflects these works: the pathos of the cute object already de-formed by the intersubjective encounter with the subject (artist, viewer). That these works should literally take the form of the child - one might say, they virtually demand to take the form of the child - only dramatizes this uncanniness, at the same time it discloses the understanding that nothing is more uncanny than the child herself. THE ART OF CUTE LITTLE THINGS 15</page><page sequence="14">This identity of the kawaii and the bukimi, the cute and the uncanny, has not been lost on Japanese art critics and observers nor on the devoted fans of Nara (although neither the formal dimensions of the "uncanny" pertaining to cuteness nor the historical relation of the "cute" to the avant-garde have been adequately theorized). What is particularly difficult to grasp, however, is how that conjunction mobilizes such intense fan affection. With affects ranging from tenderness to breathless praise to passionate attachment and beyond, devotees find in Naras works an intensity of expression that speaks for them, that speaks a shared relationship to their past, and specifically, to their childhood. The art critic Matsui Midori writes that Naras paintings "re- capitulate the child's telepathic sympathy with the phenomenal world"; later in the same essay, she remarks the "special gaze" of the child in Naras work, as it "penetrates beyond the world she inhabits."27 The syntax of dreams, un- spoken forms of communication (Naras use of language awaits a study: its display of comic-book captions, its reliance primarily on English but also on Japanese and German, its slyly fractured use of punctuation), and magical forms of identification all become modes of description for Nara critics and fans. The assessments seem to go beyond critical praise and analysis, and take flight into worlds of description that the writers hope can do justice to Naras children. One wonders how much these lyrical flights of critique are really focused on Naras works and how much they are really talking about the figure of the child itself and its ineffability. Yet, at the same time, this critical lyricism is pointing to nothing else but the commodified everyday, that place where "nothing ever happens" (the title of one of Naras solo exhi- bitions in 2005), and which Nara (along with contemporaries such as novelist Yoshimoto Banana) pulls into the malleable, open world of childhood imag- ined from afar.28 Naras art works with the intimacies of the cute and the ghastly, but in ways more intimate than Murakamis explosive fusions and bluntly didactic foregrounding of the unmitigated horror of the kawaii in its Japanese in- carnation. They produce undeniable effects of fan devotion. Nowhere is this seen more clearly than with his groundbreaking exhibition at the Yokohama Museum of Art in 2001 entitled "1 don't mind, if you forget me," which established Nara as a major contemporary artist in Japan. Nara had recently returned to live in Japan after some ten years in Germany, and the exhibition represented a homecoming for him, a return to the land of his childhood. This exhibition explicitly produced the museum as a theater of childhood, and it did so by producing new fans and enticing old ones to participate in what came to be known as Hamapuro (the "Yokohama Project"). The Hamapuro 16 MARILYN IVY</page><page sequence="15">entailed putting out an open call through the Nara Yoshitomo fan Web site Happy Hour (now defunct) for volunteers each to sew a stuffed doll- toy (what the Japanese call nuigurumi ) of one of Naras figures. In a reversal of the com- mercialized trajectory in which one of Nara s eminently copyable kyara ("char- acters") becomes licensed out to toy companies and made into purchasable plush toys, Nara incorporated his fans in an enterprise that was outside the commodity circuit: make your own hand-sewn Nara plush toy and then do- nate it for use in the exhibition. Imagined as a way to produce a fan collectiv- ity, as an "action" that would incorporate the energies of fans in the exhibition itself, the Yokohama Project drew on the immense longings and identifica- tions of the Nara fans to share his world. In attempting to move out of the commodity circuit - Nara increasingly uses volunteer labor to erect his mu- seum installations - and to reframe the star-fan relationship as one of gift exchange, Nara works to produce the sensation of a shared emotional and aesthetic community. What provides the basis for fans' participation in something as elusive as an artists work? (Nara doesn't have a rock band or baseball team, as of yet). The Yokohama exhibition revealed the outlines of this project. At the entrance of the museum visitors saw - spelled out in huge, hollow, clear acrylic letters - I don't mind, if you forget me (Figure 5). Massed inside those letters? Hun- dreds of the stuffed Nara-figures made by his fans - there were some 1,500 figures in total - redefined, in the process, what it means to be a "stuffed toy" (Figure 6). Lined up on shelves below these letters were vintage toys, Naras own collectibles, not all of them nuigurumi but all of them childhood toys. In another section of the museum was installed an enormous, room-spanning mirror with the words YOUR CHILDHOOD imprinted across the middle. And there, on the floor in a most promiscuous pile, were hundreds more fan-made stuffed dolls, heaped in profusion. Walking into the room, visitors confronted their own reflections in a mirror entitled YOUR CHILDHOOD, which reflected as well the sea of stuffed toys piled on the floor (Figure 7). The art critic Sawaragi Noi thinks through the relationship of the kawaii to the bukimi (he explicitly remarks a relationship of equation between them) in an essay that compares the tried-and-true coupling of Murakami and Nara to the American one of Jeff Koons and Mike Kelley in the 1980s: Koons with his monstrous pink panther balloons and stainless steel rabbits, the shine and gloss of the commodity form and its sheen of glossy technical achieve- ment contrasted with Mike Kelley and his defaced, restitched, stuffed ani- mals, discarded objects unfit for the "adult" space of the museum.29 Here, the commentary on art - high/low, museum'd and otherwise - is paralleled THE ART OF CUTE LITTLE THINGS 17</page><page sequence="16">figure 5.

Sawaragi is in- terested in how not only toys but stuffed toys have functioned in aesthetic theory and practice. In thinking, then, about the place of the nuigurumi in contemporary art, Sawaragi deftly refers to them as "transitional objects" (iko taisho). What, indeed, are stuffed animals, plush toys, doing for all those two-year-old kids? They are, in the thinking of the psychoanalyst D. W. Win- nicott, objects that help the child move away from the Mother by operating as substitutes for the maternal presence. They are loved fiercely, and, in the strongest instances, they never leave the child, even to the point of the disin- tegration of the soft object itself (one remembers The Velveteen Rabbit). At a certain moment, however, they must be overcome, discarded, expelled from the household and from the physical attachment and love of the child, if the child is to transition into the world of the adult, so object-relations analysts contend. Yet what becomes of the discarded transitional object? What hap- pens when one does not give up the transitional object? Then we might find the perpetual child, the one who transfers transition, who defers transition, from one beloved object to the next. (This deferral of transition could de- scribe a dimension of perversity.) Is this description so different from the obsessive otaku fan, the Nara groupie, or even the modal addictive consumer of late capitalism? What Nara thematized so forcefully in "i don't mind, if you forget me" was the place of this transitional object, its place as remnant, as refused and as refuse, as leftover and excess. By virtue of this leftover quality, the abandoned nuigurumi powerfully embodies and evokes the child as past, and the past as the child. What is engaged is the place of the child as z tself objecti- fied as transitional, commodified in the work of art and imagistically avail- able for purchase in any number of Nara stuffed toys (for adults as well as for children). The child is always and ever in transition , and it is only by a pro- cess of abandonment that one can provisionally give up the fixated version of childhood to which one clings. In visually fusing YOUR CHILDHOOD with the abandoned nuigurumi, visitors were invited to reflect - literally - on an irrevocably past but still potent identification with the child. For anyone who has been to Japan and visited Buddhist temples, the sight of figures of the bodhisattva Jizo, the protector of pregnant women, children, and the dead, standing over heaps of material objects given in remembrance of deceased loved ones is familiar. Jizo has come to be the patron saint, if you will, of aborted fetuses; women who have had abortions (along with women who have lost a child) often give offerings to Jizo, many of which consist of dolls, toys, stuffed animals, items of clothing: all the material signifiers of THE ART OF CUTE LITTLE THINGS 19</page><page sequence="18">childhood, now given away and alienated as offerings. To see heaps of pur- posefully abandoned nuigurumi is inevitably to evoke the deathly resonances of Jizo offerings. Nara is from the prefecture of Aomori, where the sacred Mount Osore is known for its yearly summer festival in which blind female spirit mediums call down the dead. Mount Osore is watched over by Jizo, and innumerable small Jizo shrines, almost buried in offerings of children's clothes, toys, and dolls, mark the landscape of the mountaintop. However distantly, this rela- tionship of death, children, and the accumulation of nuigurumi must function in the artistic unconscious of Nara Yoshitomo. As such, then, the excess of these dolls, these toys, at the Yokohama exhibition evoked a kind of "horror," according to one critic, a horror connected both to the death of childhood through the abandonment of toys and to the palpable death of actual chil- dren evoked by a number of dolls heaped on the floor. The dolls functioned as stand-ins for the dead: dead children, the death of the child's time, the dolls themselves as corpses.30 As "stranded objects" that can no longer be used to help the child transition into maturity, they evoked a particular melancholy and morbidity.31 Yet these stuffed toys were constructed to be exhibited, constructed to be abandoned in this overtly theatrical way. They were not, precisely, the aban- doned, dirty "lovie," with button eyes missing and ears ripped off. These were new, handmade dolls - faithfully portraying or evoking Naras signature fig- ures - that were given up by fans to be exhibited and then used to stage the scenario of the abandoned transitional object. The peculiar nature of these nuigurumi is disclosed by the letters from the Hamapuro fans to Nara the artist, many of which were published.32 The fans referred to each other as "brothers and sisters" ( kyodai ); what is more, they refer (as did Nara himself) to the dolls ( ningyd ) themselves as brothers and sisters, or alternatively, as their "children" ( ko ). Take this message from Nanao: "First off, I was deeply impressed by how the exhibit was put together . . . Seeing so many brothers and sisters, filled with loving care, I was so happy I could hardly stand it. No matter how many there were and even though there were so many of them, I thought they were all works familiar to me in their innocence. (I had a weird [fushigi na ] feeling when I saw myself reflected in the mirror.) I thought it was really wonderful that I could participate. When I found my child [ko] in the exhibition hall, I thought, 'It really did arrive in good order!' and I started to cry a little."33 Another one: "When I saw them in photographs, they appeared extremely individualistic taken one by one, but when I actually saw them at the exhibition, they became one work, and it was really moving. I searched 20 MARILYN IVY</page><page sequence="19">for my sibling [ kyodai ] with all my heart, and I found one that looked like it was the one. It was great that I could participate in such an awesome [suteki na' project." And another: "I was transfixed by forms that exceeded my imagi- nation. Once again it came home to me how amazing Nara-san is. Really, going to look for my sibling was such a joy." Repeatedly, the messages express their appreciation ( kansha ) to Nara, their feelings ( kanjo ), and their happi- ness at being part of the "project" in which they communed with "brothers and sisters" Actively produced as coparticipants and as intimately produced dolls (which also took on the status of children). The back jacket of the exhibition catalogue responded to the title I don't mind, IF YOU FORGET ME by proclaiming "Because, You Never Forget Me. I Never Forget You." If we can move through the oddities of these phrases (in- cluding the punctuation), we might imagine (as Sawaragi does) that the sub- ject here, the "I" (boku) of the enunciation stands in for the abandoned child within, who had to be given up along with the beloved nuigurumi as well as childhood itself. The addressee must be the adult viewer, those who through this exhibition can reencounter the lost land of childhood and the lost child there. The child, the child of the past, the lost child, and the thrown-away transitional object fuse here in a movement of prosopopoeia (the movement of personification, which Ngai says is always at stake with the "cute" object and its relation to its owner or viewer: one thinks of dolls and the ventrilo- quism of their child owners). The dead child and the abandoned doll are given voice in Naras titles, and what is creepier than the undead (child, doll) speak- ing? The voices are from beyond the grave or the trash heap, saying, "I don't forget you" ("Because, You Never Forget Me"). In a reversal of the title of the exhibition - "i don't MIND, IF YOU FORGET me" - the rejoinder on the back of the catalogue reminds us that there is an "unforgettable" dimension to the relationship of child and transitional object, adult and inner child. Here is where the therapeutic dimension of Naras exhibition is encountered: not unlike "inner child" therapies in the United States and elsewhere that would enjoin the adult to use finger paints or to draw with the nondominant hand in order to go back to the state of childhood, to recover the missing "inner child," Naras work solicits viewers to attend to an inner world of affect that had been repressed in an attempt to transit to adulthood.34 Sawaragi has argued that along with this potentially therapeutic dimen- sion of Naras staging for viewers is perhaps a more persuasive interpreta- tion: that in contemporary Japanese consumer society, everyone is in thrall to commodity fetishes in the guise of kawaii mono (cute things), mass cultural figures, icons, and Internetted experiences, such that the transitional object THE ART OF CUTE LITTLE THINGS 21</page><page sequence="20">NARA CRAWS' ON THIS* INCHOATE U3NEWNESS OF THE VOONS IN U nev" the dependency on RECESSIONARY JAPAN, "« °b'e" that keepS "« Mother "ear is REFUNCTIONIU5 LONELINESS AS m"dy ^ f°™ &lt;° «•" THE BASIS FOR CO/VWUNnY other, keeping Japanese (or Japanese con- ITSEtFi THE I^NEUNESS, ONE sumers) in a state of perpetual childhood.

On this view, PIMPS AtPUUTHOOP LACK'h'&amp;- 7 7 Japanese institutional structures of adult 'l order and symbolic force are profoundly complicit in reproducing this system of childishness. As such, most viewers of Naras exhibition probably did not experience anything like a therapeutic catharsis through the reminders of childhood traumas of abandonment; they merely, as Sawaragi proffers, turned toward Naras iconic "characters" in a movement of desire and attraction ( kyara moe ), as his works engage the inti- mate entanglement of iconic "characters" from mass culture and older forms of portraiture.35 Yet it is clear that Naras fans - fans largely drawn from a certain rec- ognizable stratum of shojo or post-shojo girls and women - are subjects who do register some sort of cathartic encounter with childhood in viewing his works, and particularly in a form of community that was enabled by the Yokohama Project. Nara himself muses on this fan relationship in an interview: In Japan my fans are people who don't often go to galleries and museums. They just like my pictures, I don't really know why. Most of them are teen- agers, some in their twenties, and a few in their thirties. In the beginning I was afraid that they were too young to follow my work, but their reaction to it led me to realize that they understand correctly, and deeply, what is expressed in my paintings. They spend no time on the surface of the work. I can verify this from the overwhelming flood of fan letters that I receive. The publisher of my last book enclosed a small readers' survey card to fill out, and whereas in most cases people don't take the trouble to pick up a pen, we received thousands of replies, many of them quite detailed. It meant that the majority felt personally addressed by my work; in Japan there are hardly any kids who haven't experienced the things I have or shared the same feelings.36 While Sawaragi believes that Naras work follows the movement in post- modern Japanese art from an emphasis on the artist and the work of art 22 MARILYN IVY</page><page sequence="21">to the lure of the kyara, Nara instead seems to mediate between an older sense of the artist and a serial logic of kyara proliferation (indeed, Nara de- nies that there is any seriality in his work whatsoever, although an intensive repetition of motifs and forms is obviously at work). His multiple paintings of virtually identical child figures - each one, however, entailing a crucial aesthetic difference - make homely and unhomely the serialized modalities, however enthralling, of kyara production. Indeed, Nara personalizes serial- ity while keeping it recognizable and leaving it open after the fact to mass- cultural recuperation (just look at his plush toys on the market, wherein his figures become "characterized"). His child paintings operate as genera- tive nodes of filiative identification with his fans: they literally operate as children and siblings for fans, and arguably, for Nara. This sense of filiative identification binds his fans into networked affiliations, often notated in the language of kinship. Nara draws on this inchoate loneliness of the young in recessionary Japan, refunctioning loneliness as the basis for community itself: the loneli- ness, one might say, of the subject who has given up the transitional object but finds adulthood lacking. What might seem to be an aestheticization of the (potentially) political - the cutification of the raw sentiments of rebellion and dissatisfaction among capitalist youth - is here changed into a version of the politicization of the aesthetic - or at least what I would call a para- politicization. Nara never calls for overt, public political action as such. Yet his group endeavors produce a mode of politics "beside" public politics; not simply personal, this parapolitics is based on shared affects and affections and generates forms of association and communality difficult to establish in late capitalist Japan.37 His mobilization of volunteers for his installations, his ongoing contact with his fans, his published diaries, his blogs and writings, his globe-spanning art projects can all be seen to form a parapolitics based on a zero degree of community: the fact that weve all been children. Nara does not foreground his location primarily within a national frame. His is a traveling practice, shaped by his ten years of life and art in Germany and his world travels and wanderings, travels that have taken him through- out Europe to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea, and beyond. His studio artistic practice has been highly solitary, contrasting sharply with Murakami s factory-like atelier. While undoubtedly shaped by a postwar culture of the kawaii in Japan - and in conversation with mass- cultural iconicity in the United States and elsewhere - Nara's work takes on the always-available space of childhood as something generalizable, beyond national-cultural enframements. He uses it as the basis for an expressive, THE ART OF CUTE LITTLE THINGS 23</page><page sequence="22">parapolitical practice - one formed around fans and fan objects as Active kin, the detraumatization of loss by an aesthetic therapeutics, a refunctioning of the kawaii as a staging of the relationship between subject and object, a pacifist stance (Nara has long opposed the war in Iraq, for example), and a devoted attention to the child as the embodiment of the critical potential of the kawaii.38 Nara's exhibition at Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York in February and March 2009 centered on two spire-topped miniature houses fit for hob- bits, one shingled green and another with an orange cast (could they possibly have been meant to evoke Manhattans Twin Towers?) (Figure 8). One had to bend down or kneel to see into the interiors, bodily producing the sense of peering into the secret spaces of children. One of the houses, illuminated from within, contained a painting of a round-eyed, button-nosed girl - still staying true to Naras themes of young girls, but here reprising the kitsch Keane doll look familiar in the United States (or perhaps a Hummel figurine). On the floor of this elfin structure, we found a pile of stuffed toys: this time - not the carefully hand-sewn Nara figures of "1 don't mind, if you forget me" - but explicitly mass-produced, low-end soft toys (Disney figures, rag dolls, teddy bears, ducks) given to Nara, yet again, by his fans (Figure 9). The other miniature hut evoked nothing so much as a trolls house in the Black Forest (its shingled spire, however, had been lopped off - burned off, if the charred, ragged edge of the roof was any indication). This structure had a tiny desk, outfitted with colored pencils and a completed drawing on its surface. The drawing was of a burning house; on the wall hung another drawing of a girl with Naras old signature glaring eyes, a house in the background, and the lettered word heimweh ("home pain," "homesickness" in German). It seems that Nara hasn't given up the productive search for home, installing it within increasingly exotic and fairy-tale enclosures, a "home" that is never where it seems to be, in flames at the same time the child burns with the intimate yet foreign kernel of heimweh. Released in 2007, the documentary Nara: Nara Yoshitomo to no tabi no kiroku (officially translated as Traveling with Yoshitomo Nara) follows Nara and his entourage throughout the world, revealing the fan passions that ac- companied him as he mounted the exhibitions that became part of "A to Z," which again thematizes Nara's repeated attempts to construct a "home" in the midst of never being there. In the documentary, Nara states: "I work with other people a lot now. And unlike before, I don't draw those cynical chil- dren. They're still desolate, but they're not as transient. The pictures are a bit deeper now. But it's not an evolution of my paintings as artwork. It's because 24 MARILYN IVY</page><page sequence="23">figure 8.

I learned how to interact with other people."39 Although those "cynical children" still show up in Naras drawings, more of his paintings now depict children with eyes that are round and filled with stars, or closed in sleep: children who are transient but not as desolate as before (Figure 10). Naras art of transitional objects has brought together not only lost children in Japan but elsewhere, forming unexpected soli- darities based on a grappling with the kawaii, the aesthetic marker for the most reified of objects and the most vulnerable of subjects. Nara has animated fan solidarities around a paradoxically activist art centered on cuteness and its latent capacities to signal a shared realization of the vulnerabilities of young sub- jecthood in commodity culture. Naras art, perpetually staging the double- ness of the cute child-object/subject and its abandoned home, transforms the anomie of capitalized life through its animation of the parapolitical powers of fans, with their "unreasoned enthusiasms" for, and as, cute little things. Notes I would like to thank Nara Yoshitomo for allowing me to reproduce images of his works. In addition, I am grateful to Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York (and Eve Wasserman there) and to Tomio Koyama Gallery in Tokyo (and Tomoko Omori there) for their gener- ous assistance in securing permissions and images.

There have been innumerable essays in English and Japanese considering the import of the shojo figure and the allied place of the kawaii. Crucial to the theorization of shojo culture are Otsuka Eiji's works, including Shojo minzokugaku: Seikimatsu no shinwa o tsumugu "miko no matsuei (The ethnography of young girls: "descendants of shama- nesses" who spin end-of-the-century myths) (Tokyo: Kobunsha, 1989). One of the most relevant for any consideration of contemporary Japanese art is Matsui Midori, "Beyond the Pleasure Room to a Chaotic Street: Transformations of Cute Subculture in the Art of the Japanese Nineties," in Little Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture, ed. Murakami Takashi (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2005), 208-39. John Treat's essays on Yoshimoto Banana are important engagements with shojo aesthetics and affects in litera- ture and culture.

See Asano, "Toward Fragmentation," again. 17. Thomas LaMarre has questioned this description of Nara's children as post- oedipal rather than non-oedipal, as Azuma and others might argue. While the discourse on otaku sensibility and the novel forms of desire and sociality that otaku embody might indicate a non-oedipalized formation, Nara's children reveal, it seems to me, a continuing reliance on an oedipal paradigm. Their alternately aggressive and seductive relationship to the adult world, their precocious and oft-angry gazes, and their typical reliance on THE ART OF CUTE LITTLE THINGS 27</page><page sequence="26">prostheses of inscription - whether pen, knife, cigarette, or brush - mark these children as firmly within the symbolic order, with all the oedipal accompaniments thereby entailed. Whether one could ever actually be post-oedipal remains an intriguing question (perhaps one is either oedipalized or not, period). Nevertheless, Nara's children - too young and cute for the kind of anger and aggression they so complexly express - rely on a conflictual relationship to the authorizations of the symbolic order that can only be imagined as oedi- pal, post- or otherwise. In contrast, Murakami's art seem to emerge from beyond the kinds of relationships that Nara's works stage. 18.

Sawaragi, "Nara Yoshitomo no bukimi," 365-67. 1 would refer the reader back to the registers of childhood that I outlined earlier in this essay; with Sawaragi's argument, we see replicated many of the familiar arguments about the childishness of Japanese society that have been put forth by Western and Japanese critics alike. Sawaragi's writings - along with Azuma Hiroki's, Otsuka Eiji's, and others' - have influenced Murakami Takashi's thoughts on the puerility of Japanese society, the society of "little boys" that then became the basis for his "Little Boy" exhibition, with its theorizations of otaku subcultures and the centrality of the kawaii for contemporary Japanese art and life. 36. Nara Yoshitomo, "My Superficiality Is Only a Game: A Conversation between Stephan Trescher and Yoshitomo Nara," in Nara, Lullaby Supermarket, 103-10 (Niirnberg: Institut fur moderne Kunst Niirnberg, 2002). 37. 1 realize this use of "parapolitics" is quite to the side of standard uses of the term, which range from theoretical analyses that attempt to think about politics that transcend conventional political forms to perhaps its more common usage in referring to covert or illegal political forms and actions, forms that are often repressed. I aim to use the term literally, to indicate a form of unrecognized politics "existing parallel to, or outside, the sphere of mainstream politics." (OED, s.v. "parapolitics"). The formation of fan communi- ties around Nara's art - and Nara - works as a form of (para)political action, one that works to produce forms of solidarity resistant to right-wing politics, the justification of war, and neonationalist movements in Japan (and elsewhere). 38.
