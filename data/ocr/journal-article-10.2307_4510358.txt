<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bird-Banding 98] Recent Literature April the present range of the Waxwings. Waxwings are thought to be descendants of a migratory population that diverged early from the primitive stock. The Palm- chats are thought to be the descendents of an isolated population that developed communal habits. The Silky Flycatchers became adapted for insect feeding and have specializations which are roughly similar to those of the Tyrannidae. It is suggested that the Bohemian Waxwing, Bombycilla garrula (Linnaeus), may have become isolated in Eurasia and later came into contact with the Cedar Waxwing, Bombycilla cedrorum Vieillot, after the two had become genetically well differen- tiated. The Japanese Waxwing, Bombycilla japonica (Siebold), is regarded as an earlier derivative of the Waxwing stock since it has characteristics that seem rela- tively unspecialized.-D. S. Farner. 60. Birds from the State of Veracruz, Mexico. George H. Lowery, Jr., and Walter W. Dalquest. 1951. University of Kansas Publications, Museum ol Natural History, 3(4): 531-649. This very important contribution to the ornithol- ogy of Vera Cruz is based on the 1,007 specimens and field notes obtained by the junior author in 1945-1949, a collection of about 200 specimens obtained in 1937 and 1938 by Mr. Dyfrig McHattie Forbes of Petrero Viejo in Vera Cruz, and 87 specimens obtained -by the senior author and Robert J. Newman in 1937 and 1949. This material gives the basis for distributional data on 297 species. Following a discussion of the life-zones of Vera Cruz based on the observations of the junior author, the -bulk of the treatise is an annotated list.-D. S. Farner. 61. A Country Parish. Great Budworth in the County of Chester. A. W. Boyd. 1951. William Collins Sons and Company, 14 St. James Place, London, S.W. 1, England. 278 pp. 21s. A comprehensive history of an English parish, starting with man's influence on the fauna and flora, continuing with "man"- history; social conditions; farming, past and present; speech; folk-lore, etc., then passing to the mammals, birds, butterflies and flora. Mr. Boyd has done a great deal of banding of his home birds and he tells of returns and recoveries of Rooks, Starlings, Greenfinches, Yellowhammers, Tree Sparrows, Robins and Barn Swal- lows, also recording brood-size in a number of species. The final chapter on the plants is especially interesting. There are 48 black and white photographs and 24 color photographs of much charm. Mr. Boyd shows himself a fine all-round naturalist, keenly aware oi all the life around him, and recording it vividly and sympathetically for his readers.-M. M. Nice. 62. Flight among Animals. (De Fliegkunst in het Dierenrijk.) E, J. Slijper with the cooperation of J. M. Burgers. 1950. 1E. J. Brill, Ouden Rijn 33a, Leiden, Holland. viii + 178 pp. 14.50 guilders. This interesting book repre- sents a condensation of a tremendous amount of information concerning the physics and biology of animal flight with emphasis on the flight of birds. Following a resume of the history of the knowledge of animal flight, there is a chapter on the groups of flying animals, living and fossiL Chapter Three is a well-illustrated discussion of aerodynamics particularly in relation to flight by animals. In many respects the most interesting part of the book is Chapter Four which is concerned with the body structure in flying animals, including considerations of body form, wing area, wing form, skeleton, and musculature. Interesting comparisons are made among various groups of flying animals. Chapters Six and Seven consider gliding and flapping flight respectively. These are profusely illustrated with dia- grams from many sources. There is a bibliography of eight pages. This treatise of flight is clear and effective. The numerous illustrations and tables will make it very useful even to those who are unable to read Dutch.-D. S. Farner. 63. Stalking Birds with Color Camera. Arthur A. Allen, 1951. National Geographic Society, Washington 6, D. C. viii + 328 pp. $7.50 in U. S. A. and Possessions; $7.75 elsewhere. This volume is primarily a collection of 331 illustra- tions in natural color from Kodachrome and Ektachrome photographs, mostly bx the author. Two hundred sixty-four species are included. To state that these illustrations are exquisite is indeed understatement, Their importance in stimu- lating a wider interest and.appreciation of birds can scarcely be over-estimated. To prepare a text, if such is indeed necessary, for a book of this type is indeed diffi-</page><page sequence="2">Vol. XXIII Recent Literature [99 1952 cult. Much of it, like many of the illustrations, has appeared previously in the National Geographic Magazine. It is highly anecdotal, frequently anthropomorphic, but at times interesting, particularly when the details of the procurement of photo- graphs are given. It is, however, as a collection of illustrations of unsurpassed quality and choice of subjects, that this book is recommended without reservation to anyone interested in birds.-D. S. Farner. 64. Wildlife in Color. Roger Tory Peterson. 1951. Houghton Mifflin Com- pany, 2 Park Street, Boston, Mass. vi + 191 pp. $3. This colorful little book, sponsored by the National Wildlife Federation, is designed basically to stimulate a sympathetic appreciation of wildlife and the necessity of effective wildlife con- servation. Wildlife conservation is a national problem and, in a democracy, its basic elements must be understood by a substantial portion of the citizenry. Con- sequently this book is directed to the average layman. Bearing this in mind, the selection and presentation material are both well conceived. To a great extent the text is constructed about the colored reproductions of 453 National Wildlife Federation stamps. The aspect is essentially ecologic, an aspect which has been lacking too frequently in presenting the problems of wildlife conservation to the layman. Western species are not accorded an emphasis equivalent to that given to eastern species. It is disappointing to find that so characteristic a species as the Water Ouzel has been omitted. Unfortunately the reproduction of the illus- trations is by no means uniformly good. Nevertheless this little book is certain to make an importan.t contribution to the development of a greater sympathy for American wildlife. Because of its potential effectiveness -in this respect it is to be hoped that it will have a wide distribution.- D. S. Farner. 65. Birds of Montezuma and Tuzigoot. Henry H. Collins, Jr., with illustra- tions by Roger Tory Peterson. 1951. Southwestern Monuments Association, Mon- tezuma Castle National Monument, Camp Verde, Arizona. 14 pp. $0.25. This attractive little bulletin has been prepared obviously for the visitor who knows nothing about birds. Forty-four species are described in varying detail for pur- poses of field identification. As an aid to identification of these species by the ornithologically inexperienced the bulletin should prove quite useful despite the feeling of the reviewer that the approach could have been at a somewhat higher intellectual level.-D.. S. Farner. NOTES AND NEWS Dr. Donald S. Farner has served as an editor of Bird-Banding for the span of 37 issues, and has carried the heavy load of responsibility for the reviews in virtu- ally all of these issues. It has now become impossible for him to find time for this work, because of his increasing responsibilities in teaching and research at The State College of Washington. With the July issue, therefore, Dr. Farner will limit his work on Bird-Banding to reviews of material in some of the European languages which few other American ornithologists are able to read easily. Seldom has familiarity with ornithological works in other languages been more important than at present, to aid our own research and to avoid duplication of effort; but seldom has it been harder for journals to maintain a comprehensive review section, be- cause of the many other tasks confronting those competent to write such reviews. To Dr. Farner, more than to any other single individual, goes the credit for the breadth of coverage of our review section, achieved by his sacrifice of countless evenings and week-ends. We hope to maintain this breadth of coverage, and we welcome as the new head of the review section Dr. Oliver L. Austin, Jr., widely known for his many years of banding on Cape Cod, Mass., and the author of many books and papers on other aspects of ornithology. Dr. Austin has recently returned from seven years overseas, the last four in charge of wildlife work in Japan under the Occupation. In our January, 1951, issue, we urged readers to make use of Section Aves of the Zoological Record, if they were not already familiar with it. Since then, the Treasurer of the American Ornithologists' Union has agreed to accept orders, even</page></plain_text>
