<plain_text><page sequence="1">IPJ JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Jul Vol.XLI No. 3 September 2007 Veblen and the Problem of Rationality Ferudun Yilmaz Despite the substantial body of literature interpreting the works of Thorstein Veblen, his theory of rationality is rarely discussed. Analyzing his theory of rationality is not just important for understanding the nature of his critical stance on the mainstream economics of his time, it is also important for focusing on reconstructive elements in his analysis. In order to clarify Veblen's theory of rationality, the concept of rationality should be discussed at a two levels. The first level concerns the nature of human action and its rationality; called "the problem of individual rationality." Veblen's rejection of rational calculative action is well known. Although he never formulated an alternative theory of action in a standard form, implicit pragmatism in his analysis gives us a chance to define his theory of action in pragmatic terms. The evidence of pragmatism in both his intellectual roots and his work should be analyzed in detail to clarify his theory of rationality in terms of the theory of action. The second level of rationality, which in Veblen's work is related to his assessment of the fate of the machine age, could be called "the problem of social rationality" (Tilman 1999, 93). To Veblen, the machine process represents the distinctive characteristics of modern industry. It both pervades modern society and determines all types of social action within that society. The habits of thought disciplined by the machine process lead society to rationalize the irrationalities of the price system. For critics, this kind of rationalization process implies the universalization of instrumental rationality. In this manner, his works are perceived to both universalize technology and as an instrumentalistic conception of action.

The first one is the opportunity for defining Veblen's individual rationality in terms of contemporary pragmatic literature on human action. The second opportunity is the attempt to establish a connection between Veblen's individual rationality and his social rationality. The distinctions between individual and social actions (and their corresponding forms of rationalities), like the other traditional distinctions, for instance between macro and micro, agency and structure, action theoretical and systems theoretical approaches, represent two extreme approaches to theorizing about the actor. Rational choice theory, the paradigmatic core of neoclassical economics represents one extreme, in which only the individual matters. The individual and his/ her rationality are viewed as separate or isolated from the rest of society and social relations. This is an "undersocialized conception of human action" (Granovetter 1985, 483). At the other extreme is an approach in which only society matters. This is an "oversocialized conception" of action where "actors acquire customs, habits, or norms that are followed mechanically and automatically, irrespective of their bearing on rational choice" (Granovetter 1985, 485). Veblen's conception of action lies between these two extremes. The creative action in Veblen's thought, representing a pragmatistic conception of action, provides a framework with which to ground and connect the individual-society discussion. Veblen's action theory both criticizes the neoclassical model of action and constructs a wider framework by referring to the question of how to conceive of economic action. The first and primary goal of this paper is to argue that the problem of rationality in Veblen's work should be discussed on these two levels, and that the compatibility of individual rationality and social rationality in Veblen's work should be clarified. This compatibility can be achieved by reference to "the creativity of action" (Joas 1996). The discussion proceeds as follows. First, the relationship between economics and the theory of action is discussed. Second, to clarify the problem of rationality in Veblen, his explicit and implicit reflections on the theory of action are analyzed through reference to his intellectual roots and the contemporary pragmatic literature, such as the work of Hans Joas. We will next examine social rationality as a machine-induced rationality in Veblen's social theory and how it leads to the compatibility problem of individual rationality and social rationality in Veblen's thought. Finally, the possibilities and limitations for establishing a compatible connection between these two levels is discussed.</page><page sequence="3">Veblen and the Problem of Rationality 843 The Theory of Action and Economics Any study on rationality should first be concerned with action theories. Although action is a fundamental concept in all social sciences, the debates on action theory, as a study area, formally belong to the sociological side of the traditional divisions of disciplines. The reason for this lies in the historically determined division of intellectual labor between economics and sociology. The roots of the division are traced to early generations of economists and sociologists, like Adam Smith and Auguste Comte (Zafirovski 1999, 584), but the standard division of labor, as a kind of implicit gentlemen's agreement, is constructed based on Pareto's dichotomy between rational and non-rational actions. The field of economics, then, is restricted to rational action: irrational action is implicitly relegated to sociology (Ingham 1996, 258). While the systematic foundations for both economics and sociology were developed, in mature and modern form, by Max Weber, "[t]hese foundations were . . . classically elaborated for modern economics by Lionel Robbins in An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science and for modern sociology by Talcott Parsons in The Structure of Social Action. The foundations of this intellectual division of labour were laid by the marginalist revolution: it was marginalist economics that introduced the distinction between economy and society by abstracting economic relations from all social content" (Clarke 1982, 234). Through the triumph of marginalism, and then the formalization and mathematization of economics as an inevitable consequence of this triumph, the rigid intellectual separation between these disciplines has become institutionalized. The formalization in economics began in the 1930s and was completed in the 1950s. "By then the axiomatic methods of formalist mathematics were being systematically applied to the fundamental concepts of economic theory. The choices of an agent were now said to be rational if and only if they satisfied the axioms of preference theory or (in models with risk) of expected utility theory" (Walsh 1996, 4). Defining action on the basis of rationality, and defining rationality as the means-end framework in choosing the most efficient means for the achievement of given ends, leads to action theory that depends on instrumental rationality. "Instrumental rationality equates the rational action with the choice of the means most likely to satisfy a given set of ends" (Hargreaves Heap 1989, 39). Instrumental rationality as a potent doctrine of economics is then defined in terms of "internal consistency of choice" and "the maximization of self-interest" (Walsh 1994, 401; Sen 1993; 1994). The road taken to rational choice theory also explains why economics leaves discussion of the theory of action to sociological thought. Instrumental rationality for economics is a core concept, one that requires no redefinition. Economics just tries to universalize its action theory, which is constructed on the basis of instrumentalistic concepts of rationality. Thorstein Veblen could provide the most promising alternative action theory for modern economics. To identify Veblen's assessment of action theory and rationality, these concepts should be analyzed in terms of pragmatism. Pragmatism</page><page sequence="4">844 Ferudun Yllmaz does not just form the philosophical basis of institutional economics (Mirowski 1987); it also challenges the role of Cartesian philosophy and its action theory, upon which mainstream economics was developed. It has been conceded that debates on action theory formally belong to sociological theory; however, this intellectual division is between sociological theory and mainstream economics. In the case of Veblen, who had wider intellectual interests than the established division of intellectual labor between sociology and economics, debates on action theory should primarily be taken into consideration by institutional economics. Moreover, "the contemporary Grand Canyon in academic research and departmental organization between 'economics' and 'sociology' means that many of the most interesting questions in social science have become lost in the intervening abyss" (Hodgson 1994, 69). To avoid this loss and to have an opportunity to clarify Veblen's thought in a broader conceptual framework, debates on action theory can be imported into institutional economics literature. Veblen and the Theory of Action To interpret rationality in Veblen's thought will require clarification of his concept of action. One of the most persistent topics within Veblen scholarship has been the opposition of Veblen to rational action theory. It is well known that Veblen criticized the economic preconceptions from the pragmatistic point of view (Kilpinen 1998, 31), and it can be said that he "wages a continuous war against the prevalent presuppositions of economic science" (Kilpinen 1999, 187). Another key point in Veblen scholarship is the distinctive role ascribed to the machine process. According to Veblen ([1904] 1958, 146) "[t]he machine process pervades the modern life and dominates it in a mechanical sense." Due to his emphasis on the machine process, some critics have labeled Veblen a technological determinist. This accusation also implies the implicit legitimation of the instrumentalistic conception of rationality. When contemplating the situation, a portrait of Veblen appears whose aim is just to criticize; although these criticisms are profound and impressive, his intention was not to advance an action theory in any positive sense. According to Peukert, He (Veblen) had only one scientific aim, which he pursued by three different means. This aim was a radical and deconstructive critique of what he called prevailing habits of thought. He did not, and did not want to, unfold a positive, new, and evolutionary approach which could practically be applied to the analysis of economic processes. He did not pretend to uncover any developmental logic of economic history or institutions. Instead, his destruction of deterministic theories and implicit teleological tendencies should be interpreted as his attempts to uncover the implications of the basic freedom of human choice and valuation. (2001, 544)</page><page sequence="5">Veblen and the Problem of Rationality 845 Dyer emphasizes "the pervasive presence of homo absurdus" in Veblen's thought, which is close to Peukert's interpretation. For him, "[oln a more personal level, one wonders what reason there is to persist in looking for meaning in a world where meaning is always subject to disintegration. Veblen's way out of this potentially bottomless pit of despair can be seen in his methods: maintain an awareness of absurdity and, therefore, of the actual possibilities in life through an ironic consciousness" (Dyer 1997, 51). In short, according to these interpretations, Veblen's thought does not provide, apart from criticism, any positive action theory at the individual level; rather, he constructs a theory of homo absurdus that indeed means a deconstruction of any theory of individual action. On the other hand, here is a man who interprets technology and the machine process as the primary determinants of his social theory. "Veblen does ally himself, more or less unequivocally, with the progress-minded thinking of the 19th century rationalist. He envisages a society cleansed by the machine and its presumptive accompanying cast of thought of all ritual, reliquary, and rite" (Riesman 1995, 65). Organizing society in terms of the logic of mechanization implies the construction of society in rational terms. If that is the case, Veblen's social action theory then, is based on the rationalization process of society. The problem of rationality arises at this point. On an individual level, Veblen severely criticizes the rational human action of mainstream economics. On a social level, he allegedly provides an organization of society that converges with the rationalization process driven by the machine process. This article argues that there is no lack of harmony in Veblen's thought between individual action and social action. Veblen was not concerned with interpreting all individual action according to the model of instrumental rational action; rather, to the contrary, he offers a critique of mainstream economics based on the overly narrow concept of instrumental rationality. The charge of mechanistic determinism, apparently strengthened by the fact that Veblen emphasized the extension of the machine process, fails to point out the real characteristics of Veblen's social theory. Because of Dewey's reference to his own theory as instrumentalism, the words "instrumentalism" and "instrumental" might cause some confusion. Moreover, depending on Dewey's conception, a considerable literature has developed in institutional economics that is focused on the instrumentalist theory of value.1 Joas (1996, 132) clarifies that "Dewey's intention was never that it should refer to the relationship between consciousness and action. In his conception, a decisive role was always played by those types of action . . . which are certainly not instrumental, that is, which do not merely serve the attainment of external goals. . . . What it did mean was that human beings discovered and appropriated the world through their actions." It should be noted that the institutionalist literature on instrumental theory of value does not refer to instrumental rationality. To comprehend how compatible individual action and social action are in Veblen's thought, and how compatible the critique of rational action and the organization of society are, in terms of the machine process, it is suggested that Joas's</page><page sequence="6">846 Ferudun Yllmaz concept of creative action be applied to Veblen's individual and social action. The creative action in Veblen's thought, as a pragmatistic conception of action, serves both to rescue Veblen from some "vulgar" interpretations of technological determinism, as well as to provide an opportunity to illustrate how compatible individual and social action are in Veblen's thought. Debates on action theory are very important for theoretical considerations of institutional economics because they do "not only represent one of many possible subjects of scholarly controversy but also comprise arguments about the direction each discipline should take and how it should mark itself off from other fields" (Joas 1996, 3). The Creative Action as a Pragmatistic Conception of Action Since there is a fundamental similarity between pragmatism and Veblen's social theory, and because there is the potential for pragmatism to solve the. problem of rationality in Veblen's thought, his action theory could be constructed as the pragmatistic conception of action. The action theory in pragmatism is widely discussed in both philosophical and sociological theory; however, importing these debates to institutional economics literature has only rarely been seriously attempted.2 The main theoretical suggestion of this article is that, in order to overcome the tension between individual and social rationality in Veblen's action theory, Joas's concept of the creative action in which Joas tries to reconstruct the theory of action on pragmatist foundations, could provide a solution. According to Joas: American pragmatism is characterized by its understanding of human action as a creative action. The understanding of creativity contained in pragmatism is specific in the sense that pragmatism focuses on the fact that creativity is always embedded in a situation, i.e. on the human being's "situated freedom." It is precisely this emphasis on the interconnection of creativity and situation that has given rise to the repeated charge that pragmatists merely possess a theory that is a philosophy of adaptation to given circumstances. This accusation fails to perceive the anti-deterministic thrusts of the pragmatists. In their view, the actors confront problems whether they want to or not; the solution to these problems, however, is not clearly prescribed beforehand by reality, but calls for creativity and brings something objectively new into the world. (1993, 4) In other words, actors are continuously reconstructing their actions when they are confronted with new aspects of reality. This reconstruction is realized by a creative dimension of human action, which means an emergence of a new mode of acting. Thus, the new mode of acting itself becomes an unreflected routine. "The pragmatists therefore maintain that all human action is caught in the tension between unreflected habitual action and acts of creativity" (Joas 1996, 129).</page><page sequence="7">Veblen and the Problem of Rationality 847 Joas suggests that for the emergence of the creativity of human action, the tacit assumptions of the concept of rational action should be investigated. These tacit assumptions of the rational action model are the capability of purposive action, the actor's ability to control his body and the autonomous existence of the actor. Joas offers an analysis of the dimensions of a non-teleological interpretation of the intentionality of action, the specific corporeality and the primary sociality of all human capacity for action (Joas 1996, 148). Creativity provides a basis to understand human rationality both in its wider context and in its entirety. As Kilpinen said: The question of rationality in human conduct concerns this conduct in its entirety, as an ongoing long-term process. During its course human beings do make also calculations and rational choices, but these are ancillary reflections of our rationality, rather than its defining characteristics. If your logical armature is capable of treating only singular actions one by one - as the case seems to be with the calculative interpretation of rationality - then you are sacrificing a great deal of the possibilities of human rationality, its most important, creative part included. (2003, 300; emphasis added) Veblen and the Creativity of Individual Action Thorstein Veblen is one of the precedents of economists who have seriously questioned the rationalist conception of action (Hodgson 1988, 101). He criticized the whole structure of classical political economy, but for him the main problem of classical political economy lies in the one-dimensional conception of human nature. In Veblen's oft-quoted words: The hedonistic conception of man is that of a lightning calculator of pleasures and pains, who oscillates like a homogenous globule of desire and happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift him about the area, but leave him intact. He has neither antecedent nor consequent. He is an isolated, definitive human datum, in stable equilibrium except for the buffets of the impinging forces that displace him in one direction or another. Self-imposed in an elemental space, he spins symmetrically about his own spiritual axis until the parallelogram of forces bears down upon him, whereupon he follows the line of the resultant. When the force of the impact is spent, he comes to rest, a self-contained globule of desire as before. Spiritually, the hedonistic man is not a prime mover. He is not the seat of the process of living, except in the sense that he is subject to a series of permutations enforced upon</page><page sequence="8">848 Ferudun Yllmaz him by circumstances external and alien to him. ([1919] 1990a, 73-74) Thus, for Veblen, trying to systematize human action in terms of the calculation of pleasure and pain leads on one hand, to the elimination of the human element from economics; on the other hand, by leaving the human action in hedonistic passivity, obviates the discussion on action theory. In this hedonistic conception, human rationality is synonymous with purely calculative operations that, by the beginning of the second part of the twentieth century, will be called rational choice theory.3 Veblen does not merely criticize the hedonistic conception of action and its passivity; he also tries to construct a human action on the grounds of creativity. Inspired perhaps by Kant, he observed, "the human mind was more than a conditioned entity responding to external stimuli. Even the making of associations suggests the activity of mind. . . . The mental organs of the body respond to the environment, but in a selective manner, indicating a purposeful, discretionary quality" (Diggins 1999, 51-52). For him, there is a causal sequence between stimuli and response and it is continuous, but "the continuity is not, as formerly, conceived in terms of spiritual substance transmitting a shock: it is conceived in terms of the life activity of the organism" (Veblen [1919] 1990a, 156). The phrase "the spiritual substance transmitting a shock" might be translated into the contemporary literature as an actor who behaves in terms of internal consistency of rational choice theory, but the actor in Veblen's analysis is the man who is actually doing something, instead of simply suffering from pleasures and pains. An actor is neither an environmentally conditioned entity nor is he prescribed by reality; instead, by acting, he changes the reality that he confronts and brings something new into the world. This action can be interpreted as a creative action and it indeed means the rejection of the means-end scheme of the theory of rational action. Veblen accepts that "men always and everywhere seek to do something" (Veblen [1919] 1990a, 75) so his action is "teleological" in that sense, but this is not to say that Veblen argues for the teleological interpretation of the intentionality. He emphasizes the importance of human intentionality and purposefulness. In the teleological interpretation of the intentionality of action, cognition and action are separated as a typical Cartesian distinction. However, in Veblen's analysis, intentionality and purposefulness are not purely intellectual faculties. Instead, "goal-setting does not take place by an act of the intellect prior to the actual action, but is instead the result of a reflection on aspirations and tendencies that are pre-reflective and have already always been operative" (Joas 1996, 158). These aspirations are seated in our habits and ways of relating to the environment. In order to overcome Cartesian dualism between cognition and action, or intentionality and matter, he applies the materialist idea of causality. "Veblen consistently tried to reconcile a notion of individual purposefulness with his materialist idea of causality" (Hodgson 2004, 154).</page><page sequence="9">Veblen and the Problem of Rationality 849 Habits and habitual action are the key concepts in this reconciliation attempt of Veblen, but it is impossible to discuss the concept of habit without mentioning its relation to instincts.4 Both instincts and habits are, for Veblen, the motivational foundations of human behavior. He extensively examines both of these concepts in his Instinct of Workmanship ([1914] 1990b). Emphasizing the role of both habit and instinct in human action is primarily related on one hand to his Darwinism (Hodgson 2004, 165), on the other, the concept of habit belongs to the language of pragmatism that is used for overcoming the mind-body dichotomy (Kilpinen 1998, 26). In defining the concept of instincts, Veblen made an important distinction between tropism and instincts. As Cordes correctly puts it: He (Veblen) argued that the life of every higher species is conditioned by the complement of tropismatic aptitudes and instinctive propensities. Tropismatic behavior, that is, automatic behavior, is caused by basic physiological mechanisms. Veblen said that these physio-psychological mechanisms are the constituent elements that make up specific human propensities, in other words, that they group together as 'instincts.' These, then, have the characteristic that they, more or less imperatively, propose an objective end of human endeavor. But Veblen made clear that instincts are not to be defined in mechanistic terms like the tropismatic aptitudes that underlie them. Instinctive behavior is consciously teleological. As the distinctive feature of 'instinct,' he identified the particular character of the purpose to which it drives. 'Instincts,' in contrast to tropismatic behavior, involve consciousness and adaptation to an end aimed at. (2005, 7-8) All instinctive action is purposeful and intelligent in some degree (Veblen [1914] 1990b, 31). Instincts are, on the one hand, biological, but on the other they are guided by intelligence (Edgell 2001, 79).5 This unconventional definition of instincts provides an opportunity for diagnosing the creativity of action in Veblen's analysis since the presence of instincts does not exclude the existence of creativity driven by intelligence: The ends of life, then, the purposes to be achieved, are assigned by man's instinctive proclivities; but the ways and means of accomplishing those things which the instinctive proclivities so make worth while are a matter of intelligence. It is a distinctive mark of mankind that the working-out of these instinctive proclivities of the race is guided by intelligence to a degree not approachable by other animals. But the</page><page sequence="10">850 Ferudun Yllmaz dependence of the race on its endowment of instincts is no less absolute for this intervention of intelligence; since it is only by the prompting of instinct that reflection and deliberation come to be so employed, and since instinct also governs the scope and method of intelligence in all this employment of it. (Veblen [1914] 1990b, 5-6) A controversial topic in Veblen scholarship is whether instincts are "innate and persistent propensities of human nature" (Veblen [1914] 1990b, 2) or, as he mentioned, are "subject to development and hence to modification by habit" (Veblen [1914] 1990b, 13). According to Rasmussen and Tilman (1992, 236), Veblen used the term in an ambiguous and occasionally inconsistent manner; thus, "he is undecided as to whether instincts are innate, learned or both." Hodgson, in contrast, emphasizes the interpretation of instincts as innate and persistent propensities of human nature (Hodgson 2004, 165). He solves the problem by pointing out the difference between "instinct" and "instinctive behavior." "The instincts of an individual cannot be changed; but 'instinctive behavior' can be. Behaviour promoted by instincts can be modified or repressed, through constraints or countervailing habits or reflection" (Hodgson 2004, 165). Hodgson's differentiation between the concept of instincts and instinctive behavior provides an opportunity for the evolutionary analysis of society in terms of instincts and habit. Habits and instincts form a core premise of Veblen's individual action theory; they also provide a theoretical synthesis to avoid the deficiencies of the rational action model. Instincts incorporated with intelligence, i.e., creativity, and habits incorporated with change explain Veblen's rationality at the individual level. It can be suggested that the creativity of action that is driven by intelligence provides the continuity of human rationality and instinctive behavior. For Veblen, on an individual level, economic action "is subject to the sequence of cause and effect, by force of such elements as habituation and conventional requirements" (Veblen [1919] 1990a, 239). The actor is "not simply a bundle of desires that are to be saturated by being placed in the path of the forces of the environment, but rather a coherent structure of propensities and habits which seeks realization and expression in an unfolding activity" (Veblen [1919] 1990a, 74). It is well known that emphasizing the role of habit in explaining action is not just crucial, but constitutive for pragmatism. Both Peirce and Dewey put habit before reason (Hodgson 2004, 171), and Veblen also views rational deliberation as an outcome of habituation, and he established the primacy of habit over rational thought (Hodgson 2001, 140). "For Peirce, mental, intellectual and logical phenomena are also to be understood in terms of habit" (Kilpinen 1998, 26). Dewey (1957, 30) also insisted that habit is the key concept for understanding action and the formation of ideas. "Veblen adopted a pragmatist theory of action in which activity and habit formation precede rational deliberation" (Hodgson 2004, 171). In understanding human behavior, Veblen inherited from Peirce and other pragmatists the idea that instincts, habits and conscious reasoning are all very significant (Twomey 1998, 437).</page><page sequence="11">Veblen and the Problem of Rationality 851 Where does the creative dimension of action lie in Veblen's individual action theory? It lies between the concepts of habit and instincts. Individuals act creatively under the guidance of habit and instincts. When actors are confronted with new aspects of reality, they reconstruct their actions and creativity plays a key role in this reconstruction. In the emergence of a new mode of acting, the adaptation to complexity or reality is provided by instincts and habits,6 but this adaptation should not be interpreted as any kind of determinism. -The creativity of action gives a non teleological character to this adaptation because "all action is an invasion of the future, of the unknown" (Dewey 1957, 12). All action confronted with an environment that contains a horizon of possibilities are rediscovered in the crisis of action (Joas 1996, 133). In Veblen's terms, actors create bridges between the impulses to action that come from instincts and adapt to the given circumstances of the reality by relying on habits. When actors can build a bridge, it means that there appears a new mode of action. According to Veblen ([1919] 1990a 241-242) "the growth of culture is a cumulative sequence of habituation, and the ways and means of it are the habitual response of human nature to exigencies that vary incontinently, cumulatively . . . incontinently, because each new move creates a new situation which induces a further new variation in the habitual manner of response; cumulatively, because each new situation is a variation of what has gone before it and embodies as causal factors all that has been effected by what went before." The new mode of action and new mode of situation arises on the grounds of the old situation by the habitual manner of response. The creativity is anchored in an individual action and it transforms both the action itself and the situation that it is grounded in. This is what Joas called "the interconnection of creativity and situation" or "a theory of situated creativity" (Joas 1996, 133) on the basis of "situated freedom." Consequently, any attempt to define rationality in Veblen's thought should emphasize the interconnections between instincts, habits and reason. Individuals act in an ongoing process guided by instincts and habits. Veblen's pragmatistic argument about rationality extends our understanding of the nature of human behavior. In this pragmatistic interpretation, "rationality is a long-term affair" (Kilpinen 2003, 293); and "American pragmatism provides a basis in action theory from which to understand the construction of notions of intentional rationality as a creative and intersubjective process" (Beckert 2003, 773). The Machine Process and the Role of Rationality in Society The concept of habit does not simply provide a foundation for individual action; it also opens a perspective, consistent with pragmatism, for analyzing the socialization of individuals, the nature of society and the historical account of society. In Veblen's view, individuals under the impulse of their instincts develop habits of action and are in contact with the material conditions of the society they live in. These habits of action then determine their thoughts and their habits of thought both individually</page><page sequence="12">852 Ferudun Yllmaz and collectively (Brette 2003, 460). Veblen ([1919] 1990a, 38) stated that "habits of thought are an outcome of habits of life" and institutions "are settled habits of thought common to the generality of men" (Veblen [1919] 1990a, 239). The mechanism by which changes in society impress themselves on the individual mind is probably one of the most complex issues of Veblen's action theory.7 There are instincts that are regarded as the motivational foundations of human behavior on one hand, and on the other, there is the emphasis on the role of the machine process that determines the habits of thought and individual behavior. Rutherford's (1998) interpretation could be helpful to clarify the direction of the mechanism. According to Rutherford (1998, 466), human behavior is not directly determined by instincts in Veblen's thought. "The instincts provide a set of original, or basic, goals of action, but people must work out the ways and means of achieving these objectives within the environmental conditions that they face. This involves the exercise of intelligence, but the environment tends to condition or 'discipline' the way people think and act, resulting in commonly held habits of thought and behavior" (467). When material conditions apply pressure on instincts, or on "instinctual behavior" in Hodgson's words, they are "sufficiently malleable" (Tilman 1996, 77) and they may be a topic of change. However, instincts may have a crucial role in developing a new technology. By bringing about significant changes in the machine process, the new technology tends to have effects on habits of thought (Rutherford 1998, 468). The instinct that leads to the creation of new technology is the instinct of "idle curiosity" and it can be called the endogenous source of novelty in developing new technology. According to Veblen, the Western world has passed through four stages: (1) "the savage and peaceable era," which started at the dawn of humanity and closed at the end of the Bronze Age; (2) "the barbarian or predatory era," in which private property appeared, it ends at the end of the Middle Ages; (3) "the era of handicraft" which forms the pre-modern era; and (4) "the era of the machine industry." "Technology is the prime mover in these transitions from stage to stage" (Riesman 1995, 64). For example, "the transition from peace to predation therefore depends on the growth of technical knowledge and the use of tools" (Veblen [1899] 1994, 12). The advent of the era of the machine industry also depends on the technical revolution of the Western world. "The ubiquitous presence of the machine ... is the unequivocal mark of the Western culture of today as contrasted with the culture of other times and places" (Veblen [1904] 1958, 154), and by the presence of the machine process, it "pervades the modern life and dominates it in a mechanical sense" (Veblen [1904] 1958, 146). Veblen ([1914] 1990b, 311) stated that "the ordinary routine of life is more widely and pervasively determined by the machine industry and by machine-like industrial processes today, and this determination is at the same time more rigorous, than any analogous effect that was had under the handicraft system." The machine process not only transforms the whole organization of production and economic relations, it changes all social relations. It imposes its mechanical discipline on society's habits of thought. According to Veblen ([1919] 1990a, 17), "in the modern</page><page sequence="13">Veblen and the Problem of Rationality 853 culture, industry, industrial processes, and industrial products have a progressively gained upon humanity, until these creations of man's ingenuity have latterly come to take the dominant place in the cultural scheme; and it is not too much to say that they have become the chief force in shaping men's daily life, and therefore the chief factor in shaping men's habits of thought. Hence men have learned to think in the terms in which the technological processes act." The machine process is so severely and insistently disciplinarian that it transforms intelligence into a peculiar mechanical character (Veblen [1904] 1958, 147). All these quotations echo the Weberian rationalization process in which the historical development of Western society, especially its capitalist era, is explained in terms of rationalization and its endless extension into whole social relations (Weber 1976). Weber interprets the historical development as a movement toward rationalization; for Veblen, however, the presence of the machine process leads to the rational organization of society. Besides the existence of many other differences between their analysis, the crucial difference is "where Veblen saw technology as liberating man from the domination of leisure-class values, Weber saw technology as a new institutionalized form of domination that would reduce the scope of freedom; and where Veblen believed that science would enable man to apprehend social phenomena more objectively, Weber saw that science, by regarding man as an extension of nature, gave sanction to those in power to treat man as nature" (Diggins 1999, 134). For Weber, increasing instrumental rationality under the influence of capitalism leads to what he called the iron cage of bureaucracy or mechanization (Peukert 2004, 1003). Where Weber had a foreboding of an iron cage of rationality, Veblen saw an opportunity for the extension of freedom in society in which individuals act creatively. Veblen's emphasis on the machine process and its transformative character on the habits of thought will be referred to here as social rationality, which, can be interpreted as a rationalization of society and social relations in a mechanical sense. In other words, the concept of social rationality does not have any relationship with the rationality of social or collective choice; on the contrary, it defines the role of rationality in society and social relations. His emphasis on the discipline of the machine process opened his social theory to objections and accusations. The Frankfurt School criticized Veblen's machine-induced rationality (Tilman 2004) and accused him of failing to differentiate between technological and critical rationality. Technological rationality could be defined as a capacity to understand means-ends congruence and master technical skills (Tilman 1999, 99). In more philosophical and contemporary terms, technological rationality echoes an instrumentalistic conception of action and rationality.8 Where "the machine process pervades the modern life and dominates it in a mechanical sense" (Veblen [1904] 1958, 146) means that the instrumental rationality determines both economic and social relations. In other words, it seems that Veblen's analysis stands for the universalization of both technology and an instrumental rationality. Instrumental rationality is "the formal concept of a rational micro-economic agent" (Walsh 1996, 4) and "equates the rational action with the</page><page sequence="14">854 Ferudun Yllmaz choice of the means most likely to satisfy a given set of ends" (Hargreaves Heap 1989, 39). At this point, the problem arises. On one hand, Veblen's analysis suggests a pragmatistic conception of action; and rationality in that view is conceptualized under the guidance of instincts and habits, which also includes creativity. This creative rationality cannot be reduced to the narrow definition of instrumental rationality. On the contrary, it widens the concept of rationality by demonstrating the implicit assumptions of instrumental rationality. On the other hand, the description of social rationality on which Veblen's social theory is constructed seems to bring his theory to the same concept of neoclassical theory, i.e., instrumental rationality. "The concept of 'instrumental rationality' idealizes the goal-oriented (profit maximization) rational behaviour characteristic of the particular historical and cultural context of the rise of capitalism in Western Europe" (Zouboulakis 2001, 37). In neoclassical economics, individuals act in terms of instrumental rationality and their preferences are exogenous, but in its contextual meaning rationality is more than simply forms of logic. "To be rational was never merely to be consistent or efficient in the execution of any goal, irrespective of whether that goal was wise or foolish. . . . Argument concerning the rationality of a choice or action was never a purely technical value-free discourse" (Walsh 1996, 2). For Veblen, the rationality in which creativity is anchored is about how individuals cope with the world around them, and the preferences of an individual are endogenous. This article suggests that the concept of the creative action can provide a basis to overcome the tension between an individual and social rationality. In order to interpret these concepts in a compatible manner, the creative dimensions of Veblen's social theory has to be examined.9 The Idea of Creativity in Veblen's Social Theory To investigate the real accomplishments of Veblen's social theory, the misconception caused by the accusation of instrumental rationality must be removed. This accusation arises from the emphasis given to the machine process. When the machine process pervades, it leads to the rational "habits of thought" - instrumental rationality. Hodgson (2004, 206-224) considers and criticizes the causality between the machine process and habits of thought in detail. He describes "Veblen's theory of the influence of the machine process" as "one of the weakest parts of his legacy," and calls it "a wrong turning." According to Hodgson (2004, 213), "Veblen rightly pointed out that modern human culture is dominated by industrial processes and products, but did not explain how these cause changes in habits of thought." The problem, however, does not lie in the second part of the sentence; the real problem arises from the first part of the sentence. The problem is the domination of human culture, and thus habits of thought, by the machine process. Both critics and first impression suggest that Veblen defends a society in which all relations are determined by the machine process; that all social relations are operating in a mechanical sense, which means the universalization of instrumental</page><page sequence="15">Veblen and the Problem of Rationality 855 rationality. It seems to be a kind of society that is organized by a technocratic ideology, but his "radical hope for social transformation" (Diggins 1999, xi) does not have to be interpreted as a technocratic conception. In American thought, pragmatism contains ideas of creativity, mostly connected with the active shaping of nature and the idea of democracy. Therefore Veblen's "instinct of workmanship" "represents a value-laden concept for defining everyday creativity" (Joas 1993, 5-6).10 Veblen's social theory focuses "on the centrality and democratization of work and in the sense that both these concerns are epitomized in workmanship" (Edgell 2001, 155). The machine process in Veblen's analysis does not support a form of technocracy; on the contrary it is "an opportunity for self-creation on the part of the worker" (Shannon 1996, 19). Veblen also attributes creativity to workers, such as the craft workers of the handicraft era and the technical workers of the machine era. "The craftsmen habitually rate themselves as serviceable members of the community ... To the creative workman who makes things with his hands belongs an efficiency and a merit of a peculiarly substantial and definitive kind, he is the type and embodiment of efficiency and serviceability" (Veblen [1914] 1990b, 243). This is also true for the technicians. "The technician is an active or creative factor in the case only in the sense that he is the keeper of the logic which governs the forces at work" (Veblen [1923] 1964a, 262). They are also "highly trained and specially gifted experts . . . born, bred, and trained at the cost of the community at large, and they draw their requisite special knowledge from the community's joint stock of accumulated experience" (Veblen [1921] 1990c, 82). Veblen (82-83) argued that in order to do their work efficiently, these experts, technologists or engineers must not deal with commercial relations. They "must first create the mechanical possibility of new and more efficient methods of producing before the businessman's eyes are opened to new investment opportunities" (Diggins 1999, 21). When the technicians create new opportunities, it means the advancement of technology and this technological creativity is motivated by the instinct of workmanship (Cordes 2005, 6). As Cordes correctly puts it, Veblen's "instinct of workmanship" may result in a bias in human creativity. Moreover, such an instinct may influence culturally engendered habits toward efficient and useful work by favoring the dissemination of certain cultural representations within a population or between generations. What is more, compliance with cultural norms may depend in part on such an innate disposition. As a result, an institutionalized habit to perform useful or productive work may emerge as a feature of social evolution. . . . Thus, trends in and regularities across human cultures can be expected in the realm of creative activity. Creative mental effort is channeled to find ways to meet basic wants or instincts. (2005, 16)</page><page sequence="16">856 Ferudun Yllmaz The source of creativity in technological innovations in Veblen's thought, springs from the instinct of "idle curiosity." The other two instincts, namely, the instinct of workmanship and the parental bent, serve to implement and spread these technological innovations (Redmond 2003, 665). "Idle curiosity" can be interpreted as an endogenous source of novelty in technology. The instinct of "idle curiosity" is "closely related to the aptitude for play" (Veblen [1919] 1990a, 7) and it is related to "an irrelevant attention" (6-7). It is a kind of "man's natural instinct of playful speculation" (Diggins 1999, 30). The systems of knowledge, science or the machine process have advanced "under the guidance of the idle curiosity" (Veblen [1919] 1990a, 9). Technology as well as "scientific inquiry proceeds on the same general motive of idle curiosity" (26). Scientists and engineers create new forms of knowledge or new forms of technology "under the guidance of idle curiosity." Then, "[o]f the material so offered as knowledge, or fact, workmanship makes use of whatever is available. In ways already indicated this utilization of ascertained 'facts' is both furthered and hindered by the fact that the information which comes to hand through the restless curiosity of man is reduced to systematic shape, for the most part or wholly, under canons of workmanship." (Veblen [1914] 1990b, 88). On one hand, workmanship reshapes the new technology; and knowledge discovered by the creative scientists or creative technicians, "who are endowed with this supererogatory gift largely in excess of the common run" (87) transform it into the habitual body of knowledge. On the other hand, only the instinct of "idle curiosity," which has no utilitarian aim and is free from anthropomorphic illusions, can create a new body of knowledge (Diggins 1999, 80-81). The "idle curiosity" persistently disturbs "the habitual body of knowledge on which workmanship draws" (Veblen [1914] 1990b, 87 88). The concept of creativity can also be diagnosed in his analysis of scientific method. Dyer (1986, 21) examines how "Veblen's analysis of scientific methodology focuses on the nature of scientific creativity" by "analyzing the parallels between Veblen's and Peirce's views of scientific creativity." Dyer (1986, 30) indicates that "Peirce's view of scientific inquiry incorporates creativity and reason" and he argues that Veblen's analysis of scientific inquiry echoes Peirce's concept of abductive inference. Kilpinen (1999) also identifies the influence of Peirce on Veblen's analysis of scientific inquiry. By referring Peirce's division of logic, in a Kantian manner, into explicative and ampliative reasoning, in which the method of abduction stand, Kilpinen (1999, 196) stated that Veblen "has expressed familiarity with, and understanding of, the ampliative use of reason; that is to say: his theory of rationality is not confined to mere deduction." Veblen's 1919 essay ([1934] 1964b) on "The Intellectual Pre-eminence of Jews in Modern Europe" also provides acute insights into the nature of creativity in his works. Here, Veblen tries to explain the reasons that have made the Jews outstanding. The Jews "count for more than their proportionate share in the intellectual life of Western civilization; and they count particularly among the vanguard, the pioneers, the uneasy guild of pathfinders and iconoclasts, in science, scholarship, and institutional change and growth" (Veblen [1934] 1964b, 223-24). For</page><page sequence="17">Veblen and the Problem of Rationality 857 Veblen, the Jews' marginality or alienation in the dominant culture and institutions of his time are the main reasons of their intellectual contributions (Riesman 1995, 131; Reinert 2004, 527). The lonely Jewish intellectual "was the creator of new knowledge and fruitful insights" (Diggins 1999, 39, emphasis added) and his "lack of allegiance placed him in 'vanguard of inquiry'" (Diggins 1994, 467). By considering the Jewish intellectual as "a disturber of the intellectual peace" and as a "wanderer in the intellectual no-man's land" Veblen ([1934] 1964b, 227) conceptualizes him as a person who acts creatively. This intellectual wanderer is the "creative man of science" and "he comes into his own as a creative leader in the world's intellectual enterprise" (226). Veblen also uses the concept of "idle curiosity" as a leitmotif for the explanation of the creativity of Jewish intellectuals. For him, the Jewish intellectual is "a skeptic by force of circumstances over which he has no control which comes to saying that he is in line to become a guide and leader of man in that intellectual enterprise out of which comes the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men, provided always that he is by native gift endowed with that net modicum of intelligence which takes effect in the play of the idle curiosity" (Veblen [1934] 1964b, 229-30). Veblen uses the Jewish intellectuals as a metaphor to explain how the play of idle curiosity influences human action and leads to the creativity of action. When focusing on these references and treatments that contain the ideas of creativity, Veblen's emphasis on the machine process does not imply his advocacy of some form of technocracy; rather, it seems like utopianism that is constructed "in a broader and more humanistic manner in which people liberate themselves from the restrictions of the pecuniary control of industry and create a new society" (Edgell 2001, 155). In one of his most controversial studies, The Engineers and the Price System (Veblen [1921] 1990c), Veblen's main concern was to remake the economy. As Knoedler and Mayhew (1999, 264) recognized, "Veblen provided to his career long argument that the engineers were the prime candidates to remake the economy."11 He tries to develop an efficient organization of society and gives the major role to creatively acting engineers. The engineers, who are influenced most by machine induced rationality are also in a privileged position through acting creatively. Therefore, although the impact of the machine process leads to the rational habits of thought, it does not have to be such a narrow conception of instrumental rationality. Engineers and scientists, the main actors of Veblen's social theory, have creative potentials in their actions. This kind of action describes the pragmatistic conception of action discussed previously. Therefore, they cannot be described as the actors of technocratic society in which all social relations and all types of actions are determined, in a mechanical sense, by the instrumental rationality. Conclusion This study proceeded from the observation that attempting to identify rationality in Veblen's thought indicates an apparent problem. The problem becomes apparent when trying to treat Veblen's conception of individual action and his social theory concurrently. Veblen harshly criticized the hedonistic conception of individual action</page><page sequence="18">858 Ferudun Yllmaz and its corresponding form of rationality at the individual level. On the other hand, it seems, as has been argued, that he has constructed a society based on the machine process, which means the mechanization and instrumentalization of social relations and rationality. At first glance, it seems that Thorstein Veblen, who harshly criticized instrumental rationality in individual action inconsistently develops a social theory on the basis of this rationality. The main goal of this paper was to overcome the apparent problem of rationality in Veblen's thought. Remembering the affinities between Veblen's thought and pragmatism, it was argued that Joas's interpretation of pragmatism and his emphasis on creativity could help to overcome this problem. If it is accepted that Veblen's understanding of human action is more or less the same as that of the pragmatists, and if it is admitted that pragmatism defines human action as creative action, then rationality in that action cannot be reduced to narrowly defined instrumental rationality. The introduction of creativity helps overcome the problem of rationality in Veblen's thought. Creativity helps elucidate how individual action (and its corresponding form of rationality) and social action (and its corresponding form of rationality) are intertwined. The suggestion is that, with the introduction of the creativity of action, Veblen's action theory could offer the integration of individual action theory, which is driven by rational habits of thought and instincts, with the social action, which is driven by machine induced rationality. Notes 1. For descriptions and discussions of this literature, see Bush (1993; 1994), Hickerson (1987), and Tool (1977). 2. For some of these attempts, see Avio (2004), Beckert (2003), Cordes (2005), Dyer (1986), Fontana, Roe and Tilman (1992), Kilpinen (1998; 1999; 2003), and Liebhafsky (1993). 3. The evolution of the definition of human rationality from its hedonistic conception of action to narrowly defined rational choice theory is an interesting story. Ironically, the emergence of rational choice theory as a universal type of economic action would be established by bearing the cost of the elimination of utilitarianism and its philosophical traits. See Marchionatti and Gambino (1997), and Walsh (1996). 4. For the role of instincts in Veblen's theory of human nature, see Jensen (1987). 5. As an innate propensity of human nature, instincts can be regarded as a biological concept, but that is not to say that Veblen was a biological determinist. Shannon (1996, 4) states: "Proceeding on 'the materialistic assumptions of modern science,' Veblen's opening discussion of the instinctual nature of man owes a great debt to the evolutionary biology of his day; however, Veblen cannot be accused of any simple biological determinism. Rooted in human biology, instincts are nonetheless the 'root of self-direction,' the 'prime movers in human behavior.'" 6. Dyer (1984, 558) stated "behavior consists largely of habits that develop as intelligent responses to fundamental human propensities or instincts." 7. This complex issue is discussed in Veblen scholarship in the context of the theory of evolutionary change. Both the direction of evolutionary change and the relationship between instincts, habits and institutions are the basic concept of this literature. For some of the important attempts to explain the mechanism of change in Veblen, see Rutherford (1984; 1998), Edgell (1975; 2001), and Brette (2003). 8. On the one hand, it should be admitted that the translation of Veblen's terminology into the language of the Frankfurt School or the language of classical European social theory is difficult, and it is true that "the attempt to Europeanize" (Tilman 2002, 125) Veblen always carries some implicit</page><page sequence="19">Veblen and the Problem of Rationality 859 defects. On the other hand, "the Anglo-European influences on Veblen's life and thought are perhaps more extensive than has been appreciated up until now" (Edgell 2001, 161) his terminology is both translatable and transferable into both contemporary and European thought because "Veblen's social theory and intellectual perspective are a branch on the tree of Western culture, not an exemplification of American exceptionalism" (Tilman 2005, 199). Therefore, it is clear that the assessment of Veblen's thought in this broad perspective would be more clarifying. The other problem is the changing of terminology in both the Frankfurt School and in the more general European social theory; and, in between American and European versions of social theory. For example, Horkheimer prefers the distinction between subjective and objective reason. Subjective reason, here, refers to instrumental reason (Joas 1993, 82). The transformation of the more philosophical term of "reason" to the term of social sciences as "rationality" is explained in Schnadelbach (1993). Some of the works, like Apel (1984), Honneth and Joas (1988), Joas (1993; 1997), and Ray (2004), could be interpreted as attempts of constructing contemporary bridges between pragmatism and Continental thought. 9. To overcome the tension between instrumental rationality and rationality based on habitual action, Redmond (2004) tries to advance the concept of institutional rationality in dual-mode rationality. He examines the relationship between traditional/habitual rationality that he called pre-scripted rationality and the Weberian instrumental/value-rationality that he called planning rationality. Although there are some similarities between his distinction in the concepts of rationality and the distinction established here, he does not emphasize the creativity dimension of action and its corresponding form of rationality. 10. Adorno (1990, 76) criticized the centrality of the concept of adaptation in Veblen's analysis. He labeled Veblen's theory as a social-Darwinism which also implies the totalization of instrumental rationality. But as Joas (1993, 83) argued, he "failed to recognize that the pragmatists' concept of 'adaptation' never meant routine and loss of subjectivity but practical innovation, creative (emphasis original) solutions to real problems." This explanation is purely consistent with Veblen's concept of adaptation. One of the most interesting interpretations of the "principle of adaptation" comes from Dyer's article which focuses on Veblen's analysis of scientific method. Although he refers to Veblen's Kant article, which is a bit in a different context, for him, "Veblen's 'principle of adaptation' guides abductive inference' (Dyer 1986, 34, emphasis original). Peirce's concept of abductive inference depends on the nature of scientific creativity. Therefore, Veblen's principle of adaptation, in analysis of scientific method, contains creativity. 11.
