<plain_text><page sequence="1">Machines d' Architecture LA FONDATION CARTIER, JOUY-EN-JOSAS 2 FEBRUARY-21 APRIL 1992 A PLURALITY OF WORLDS The exhibition consisted of nine works by the fol? lowing architects or partnerships: Donald Bates and Ken Rabin, Raoul Bunschoten, Liz Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, Bruce Dunning and Pieter Versteegh, Meton Gadelha, John Hejduk, Daniel Libeskind, Ben Nicholson, and Jesse Reiser and Nanako Umemoto. The catalogue included intro? ductions by Jean de Loisy, Patrick Javault, Jeffrey Kipnis and Alain Pellisier, and texts by the architects, drawings and photographs. The spectator was confronted with a Borgesian collection of objects:1 a welded aluminium body armature suspended in a framework showing 'language' 'woven' by five rotating perforated metal plaques; ferrous cement casts resembling hardened lava, in the form of thin slabs, 'toys' and cabinets of varying sizes, mounted on wheels; three intricate wooden machines incor? porating elements from Diderot's Encyclopedic; collages from chain-store catalogues exploring an obsession with the minutiae of suburbia; ink wash and collage drawings presented as prophecies for the heart of a city; a voyeuristic mechanism of video monitors, cameras, mirrors and sliced-apart chairs, rotated at ninety degrees to the vertical; two cubes of cement engraved with texts; collaged texts, diagrams, and models for a yet-to-be 'Architectural Encyclopedia'. These pieces were exhibited in a group of build? ings opening on to a gravel courtyard. Many had been seen before; some had been exhibited at the A A and published in AA Files. The rooms and large central hall of 'Le Bunker', a former Luftwaffe command post built on the grounds of the chateau, were devoted to work by John Hejduk alone. In addition to pre? viously exhibited pieces, there were a pyramid, a cube and a sphere, each 'bigger than furniture but smaller than a room',2 made of, respectively, bitumen, epoxy-coated plywood and lead sheet rivetted along arcs derived from Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium; and an 'angel catcher' composed of an array of nine splayed shafts surmounting a stainless steel body harness. According to Donald Bates, who with Ken Rabin proposed the theme of the exhibition, the architects were chosen because they were 'seri? ous' about their work. The exhibition would be a unique opportunity to hint at a dialogue which, in spite of ideological or formal differences, binds them together. The work, to quote Bates, is 'purely speculative... unnecessary, with no use or utility'. Some of the projects make no refer? ence to the iconography of machines, even fewer to that of buildings. Theoretical ties are denied, as is the notion of a 'movement'. What can be made of this ironic stance, which refuses to propose in terms of established norms? If at first glance the work seems enigmatic and 'difficult', one might recall Paul Valery's reac? tion to Stephane Mallarme, who, he claims, 86 created the notion of a 'difficult author'. Valery maintains that work which 'resists' turns the passive spectator into a creator.3 'Difficulty' functions as an invitation to participate; it takes one into an intellectual and therefore public realm which discourages easy scepticism or sub? jective opinion. We are addressed by work which is complex and which questions our preconceptions of archi? tecture. But how can we enter this field? What space will be disclosed by the encounter with the projects, and to whom are they addressed? For lack of space, not all of the projects will be reviewed. The discussion will therefore be con? fined to those which exemplify certain propos? itions posed by the exhibition as a whole. GROUND [between-worlds] Space is conventionally thought of as a homo? geneous and empty datum, and the ground as a fixed and convenient platform which enables it to be cut up and sold off. The architect inserts a building into the earth; by replacing one surface with another, new ground is created. The archi? tect's responsibility is to ensure that this new ground is stable, not only structurally but also within a social and professional framework pre? determining its fixity in language, behaviour, aesthetic propriety, etc. There may be a con? siderable amount of play, but the experience of the displacement of ground itself is normally suppressed ? as are the consequences, often unexpected and ironic. In this exhibition, space was neither empty nor neutral, but pressed for time, heterogeneous, 'futured'. There was a sense of wonder evoked by so many incongruities, at the displacement in each which perpetuated the taxonomic disorder that had brought them together. Evidently the architects are concerned less with the fixity of ground than with its disruption in order to offer unexpected and challenging alternatives. If ground is in motion we are constantly entering unfamiliar territory and confronting unconven? tional notions of space, with no recourse to the language of site, programme, or social aspir? ations. The words used to describe ground or the things we place on it were continually under? mined, a shift that left reflective knowledge or abstract thought unable to fathom these projects. Language fell into the gap between equivocal communication (here/there, now/then, body/ earth) and univocal ideality (space-time). There was a moment at the press conference when nothing could be said, when an all too familiar facelessness overcame any recourse to easy analysis. Almost an aphasia, this loss of speech recalled the silence at the heart of our encoun? ters, which makes the experience of architecture an event. Yet the silence is also a deferral ? of ideality, of guarantee or certainty, of voice ? which, while remaining unacknowledged in conven? tional practice, is part of an effort to form ground all the time. But if the pieces announce a move? ment of ground, then what ground would contain even that? The displacement was all the more dis? concerting in that it had been fused with the 'real space' of an exhibition gallery, which served as a vehicle or catalyst for their mutual transgres? sions. One could not be persuaded that the proj? ects had now been appropriated, collected, made collectable. If ground moves, then space is intentional, emotive, explosive. Hence the attempt to find a position is deflected, whether in individual proj? ects or through an overall curatorial stance. In? deed the whole notion of stance is at risk. Time and change enter the brief of the architect ? the flux of experience that unites ground with chance. ADDRESS [face-to-face] If the work explores a shifting ground, then who is it for? With no apparent utilitarian function or basis in providing a service, the role of the client has been eliminated. Who are the public on whose behalf the work takes responsibility, and on whose behalf is it proposed? Typically, the exhibition review reinforces this assumption of anthropomorphic relation. The work supposedly addresses an audience, and thereby possesses a 'face' that can be questioned. It is the task of the reviewer to penetrate and uncover what lies 'behind' the face. This spatial metaphor can easily be exchanged for one that is temporal; using history and genealogy the review traces a line of descent or announces the emergence of an original form.4 The review is expected to participate in an economy of unity and teleology in order to (a) underwrite or write off the work, according to the degree of coherence it displays; and (b) to expose something in-dwelling (an im? manent cosmic form, an Idea, the 'real world'), or to reveal and name the beyond to which it points (God, transcendence, speculative profit). Such assumptions reflect a comfortable dis? tinction between 'illusory' phenomena and invis? ible truth or thought. Can work in this exhibition be judged in terms of such a presupposition and, if not, has it failed? For if ground is displaced an assumed immanence or transcendence has al? ready been called into question. And, if we are to take seriously the curator's denial of a theoretical stance, movement or genealogy, then we must also question the transmission of an authen? ticated body of knowledge that accompanies the guarantee of ideality ? for example, in law, tra? dition, revelation, or the structure of microcosm/ macrocosm. So too, therefore, these projects question the language of the review that tends to bank on a demand for unity. The encounter with the work in the exhibition was rendered problematic, not least by the fre? quent references to the transcendent and imman? ent ? in, for example, the ideality associated with Hejduk's geometric solids, the reference to Spirit in the propositions of Bates and Rabin, or AA FILES 24</page><page sequence="2">Libeskind's texts. The assumption that there is a face-to-face turns into a problem of address and, by symmetry, the question of one's own face. The displacement of ground challenges the unity consciousness imagines for itself, the mas? tery of its utterances, the centrality of the body. With ground displaced ? even lost ? the ability to speak or to propose is threatened. In the introduction Kipnis hints at this problem in his analysis of the word 'predicament', meaning both 'category', in the Aristotelian sense, and dilemma or quandary. In this exhibition, 'pre? dicament' constituted the category of its own col? lapse, the paradox inherent in the attempt to limit reality so as to define it, the gaps that exist less in the relation between language and architecture than in that between silence and space. But how can one review something about which one can? not speak or communicate? If these questions have a certain gravity, it is perhaps because they circulate around a problem of wonder, the wonder of our contact with the world. But this experience is no longer naive as we confront increasing disparity between the solution-driven methodology that characterizes our approach to the environment in general, and the unforeseen consequences of its solutions. We may ask whether architecture should follow on from received ideas about the efficacy of that approach. We may wonder whether an archi? tectural proposition can be formulated, not as the latest in a chain of failed resolutions to the 'problem of living', but as the very question of our relation to the world. Once that question has been articulated, can we in any case define the world to which it is addressed, except in terms of our uncertainty vis-?-vis its over? whelming reality? It seems not, if we are to accept that it is completed only by the unknown, outside our per? ception and knowledge. In the 'Origin of Geo? metry', Edmund Husserl calls the presence of this unknown a horizon, representing at once the unity and incompleteness in all experience.5 As phenomenology has shown, this topos can never be attained. But in the exhibition it was hinted at in the gaps between the pieces and in the inter? stices of the catalogue, which disconcertingly dictated their proper sequence. One might call the topos a threshold ? which is not to objectify it as a doorway or a gap between interior and exterior. Rather, it is to introduce the possibility that a set of material relations (among and within the pieces perceived over time, for example) might serve as a symbolic vehicle which can be used to approach the 'beyond' that the horizon designates. While the beyond represents all that is un? known, it is also no more than the resistance of artifice (the making of relation) to be finally determined. The 'space' unfolded by the sym? bolic vehicle seems undefinable, except in terms of the impossibility of denying whatever future opens from it ? more a matter of prophecy than AA FILES 24 The Anarchitomy of tec-ture Meton Gadelna, 1985 (CCA, Montreal) the insurance of a prior form. Indeed, this j threshold condition suggests that the general i category of space can no longer be constructed in i terms of the Cartesian void. Instead, space is i disclosed in the hesitation of an obscure dialogue i (between known and unknown, here and there, person and world, etc.), or the anticipation of j that encounter which could never be designed or structured, an oracular utterance delivered to an i indifferent world. i Thus the wonder provoked by the horizon (a ; threshold) suggests that architecture is a problem i which lies at the root of experience, a question \ that cannot be answered. In linking the per? manence of ground's displacement (between &lt; worlds) with the question of who it is for (face- &lt; to-face), that wonder can become both a critical i discipline and a mechanism enabling partici- &lt; pation in the construction of the world at the 1 limits of the imagination. ] i UTTERING wor] [ds ] into the gap. These problems of space, address 1 and wonder invest the practice of architecture with a new responsibility, that it must engage i with the enigmatic process in experience where- i by the world becomes whole but cannot be finally known ? the problem of ground. At the press ] conference Jesse Reiser called it 'part of the on- &lt; going effort to live'. He was suggesting that, in &lt; being engaged with the rupture of ground, the &lt; architect attempts to create it anew. Into the gap, j an artifice is placed; the act occurs in a wider context. In so far as there is a consequence for ] inhabitation, it exposes what might be called a i ' spectacle of human becoming'. &lt; (a) Language: an internal horizon &lt; But we can be induced to accept the conceit that i abstraction can replace experience, a problem i of knowledge and reason which is explored n Meton Gadelha's three intricate wooden nachines, The Anarchitomy oftec-ture. We are nvited to witness an 'operation' performed by he Surgeon (or 'Anarchitomist') on the Patient, o be watched through an instrument of pro ective geometry, the Observers. The machines ire metaphors of the labyrinthine complexity that s associated with the relation between intuition uid acquired knowledge. Here 'truth' resides, lot in the procedural logic of mechanical oper? ation, but in the trope at the origin of a word. The nachines speak not only in a familiar icono graphic language of gears and levers, but also with words (from Joyce's Finnegans Wake) and liagrams (from Diderot's Encyclopedie) printed )n some of the surfaces. But this metaphor is lever subordinated by intelligibility ? that is, it :an never be understood by the likeness drawn between pre-existing categories; as such it -emains a statement of 'isness' or 'being' ? that s, a name, 'the Patient' ? and, further, of being n-relation. Nietzsche discussed the power of the trope in lis lectures on rhetoric, maintaining that the word, a gesture of becoming, is always a 'prom nence' in the expression of the real, which can lever fully reveal what lies at its core.6 Like? wise, for Valery the language of Mallarme exem jlified the power of speech to maintain by means )f metaphor 'a symmetrical relation based on the essence of things'. Words are uttered in the res? onance of one another and have the power not ust to embellish ideas, but to create them.7 By being' their names, Gadelha's machines chal enge the assumed equivalence between com nunication and the categories of discourse, lenying the divulgence of any final meaning (the nterior of the Patient, the best view, the ietermination of knowledge). At the same time hey create a familiar (if not familial) unity, a hreshold to some other space, that can never be fully 'embodied'. 87</page><page sequence="3"> The machines are exquisite dowelled wooden constructions, obsessively self-conscious acts of technical skill. Beautiful though they may be, we suspect a certain degree of predetermination not unlike that which can be discerned in the product of a standard building programme, in which there is the occasional poor join or awkward fit. John Hejduk's three geometric solids, on the other hand, suggest the opposite approach, such that the accidents and particularities of con? struction are intrinsic to the project, a ground or history whose traces constitute the very matter of the work. Arranged tangentially, according to Hejduk's 'pointal-connective tissue' principle (familiar from his Victims, also exhibited), the base of the Pyramid placed on one side faces a vertical surface of the Cube, whose opposite face is the plane tangent to a horizontal diameter of the Sphere. These objects might be mistaken for toys illus? trating a discourse on Platonic forms. But their dimensions, construction and arrangement dom? inate the abstraction designated by their names and shapes. (They were made to fit within the 2.25-metre-high rooms of Le Corbusier's Unite d'Habitation in Briey, for the inaugural exhib? ition of La Premiere Rue.) Mute presences, they are separated by tiny gaps, each a sliver of nothing that invites investigation. Clad in painted bitumen, squares of resin-coated plywood, and pounded lead sheet, Hejduk's objects represent an utterance which, but for their transmutation into materiality, could not exist. In taking form from mere matter, geometric ideality is delayed by the impurity of construction, which claims it for itself, lifting it from earth. Ideality becomes irony, a 'figure of speech', a brief sentence out of nowhere. The objects 'speak' of beginnings, of the con? tinuing efforts of the body to overcome the force of gravity. These beginnings are neither pri? mordial nor absolute. They constitute the per? manence of change in experience, which defers any final expression of form. The gap becomes a device which allows not only for the completion of one geometry but the emergence of another, a kind of internal horizon that projects a material presence. In the attempt to discover an interi ority, attention slips into the gap; in order to recognize the absence, the beholder must also encounter it 'within'. The gap communicates, but it takes over the common experience under? lying our recognition of the pieces, exposing a kind of no-space or no-time from which the forms are distinguished. (b) Nothing 'as such' In the late fifteenth century Moorish warriors riding into battle wore talismanic 'armour' marked with fine grids, dots and other magical diagrams.8 This armour consisted of a large rectangle of wax-impregnated linen, with a slit through the centre enabling it to be worn in the manner of a poncho. The cloak was fastened around the body but it retained the semblance of a square, fortifying the warrior with transcend? ent forces. Though static, it created a 'source' for the body reaching far beyond comprehension. It produced a context, a site for human action animated by its potential to be used as a tool. The warrior was named with a rhetorical truth that would conquer on the battlefield, radiant with an insubstantial 'other' reality, without which the body could not act in this reality. Hejduk's Angel Catcher, which recalls such a ritual object, was fabricated to accompany the Sphere, Cube, Pyramid. It is affixed to a harness assembly so that it can be worn in the manner of a backpack. Supported over the head by this assembly, it resembles a crown of stars. Hej duk's drawing for the Angel Catcher, first pub? lished in 1987 in the Bovisa catalogue, shows it worn by a man, with an angel impaled on one of the spears, bleeding to death. Whereas the talis? manic armor concealed the body in order to pro? ject transcendent power, the Angel Catcher ex? poses the body beneath a weapon used to harm the messenger of transcendence. As with the Sphere, Cube, Pyramid, Hejduk creates a prob? lem of sentience in his objects; they seem to mask a 'beyond' that would animate mem, but then defer it. Like the Moorish war-coat, they point to something which is elsewhere but, in so far as they designate a 'higher' reality, that reality has been posed as a question. The question affirms the movement of experience towards such a state, yet transcendence slips away. Hejduk's pieces explore the gap that delays any final legislation between beholder and project, perception and reality. We are tempted to speculate on this gap, which suggests an ancient mythopoeic power. A world is invented out of the gap, a gap between words, in the language that names each piece. How do we explore this speculation of ground? The problem was developed in a related way by Walter Benjamin in his essay 'On Language and the Language of Man as Such', where the existence of God is posited as a construct of the 'nothing' that language 'as such' addresses.9 For Benjamin, the 'mental being' of language has neither means, objects, nor addressee. Language exposes a fundamental problem of naming, which in turn exposes the tautology that pre? supposes the communication of mental being so that it can be created. In this 'meaningless' circuit, language desig? nates a 'site' where the mental being of man creates itself, a vacuum which is nothing but the intersubjective realm wherein the tautology operates. Language, in effect, need not address anything, an irony that questions both the source of experience and its outcome. For Benjamin, this 'space' was circumscribed by a transcendent reality. But Hejduk's pieces offer no such guar? antee. As 'figures of speech', they utter rhetori? cal 'truths' which at once become cliches. The irony undermines the power of abstract reason? ing, but affirms the power of experience to draw beyond itself. Abstraction, the means by which we mediate reality, is therefore questioned by the emotion associated with its deferral. In place of cat? egories, the beholder falls back on experience to make contact with the 'effort to live' undertaken by the architect in the work itself. Hejduk's pieces are simply names ? names which address another reality from which one's own reality is derived. 'Nothing' is masked by the pieces; in being masked, they efface nothing, becoming the gap between beholder and work, the blackness and silence of one's interior. (c) Field and figure Can we embody this figure, which is at once no body and all bodies, the emotive 'space' of our relation to ground, the dark memory of earth, a primal site? The ancient Greeks named this dis? placement Chimera, an ever changing monster of contiguous relations, composites, multiple appearances. According to ancient sources, the Chimera presaged an upheaval of the earth ? volcanoes, earthquakes, events which, in break? ing land apart, can also be named as 'things'.10 Raoul Bunschoten's The Skin of the Earth ex? plores this process of dissolution. It consists of 88 AA FILES 24</page><page sequence="4">about thirty wheeled constructions in ferrous cement, first exhibited in the House of Archi? tects, Moscow, 1990. Some are familiar (a chair, toys, etc.), others are amorphous (whale-like, swollen), still others are notational (brackets). In myth, the Chimera comes into being when the chaos at the origin of the world is overcome by the division that spatializes time. She 'remem? bers' the primordial world-body, questioning a hoped-for unity with the break-up of earth. Hence Bunschoten calls his parcels of ground 'meta? phors'. They not only carry meaning from name to thing (earth, home, window), but expose the transference, which is nothing but metaphoricity ? the movement of the dissimilar in the similar that breaks through the known (in language, iconography, ground). Like the Chimera, the 'metaphor of metaphor', they are not simply violations of categorization, but the vehicles by means of which categories come into being. The ferrous cement is black, lava-like; one feels cold ground behind the familiar shapes it assumes. Bunschoten's pieces are decoys which delay the settlement of domesticity towards the tectonic face of Earth. But, inclined towards the sky, they possess the technical modesty of a thought which takes the hand away from the mind in order to create the world before it. The Chimera is also an ironical figure, at once 'the enigma whose solution is the key to the uni? verse' and the indecipherable which renders all keys illusory.11 She is a 'machine' of deferral. But if the Chimera recalls the violence of the formation of ground that is always other, whether physically or in the act of classification, then the ancient Greek daidala withholds the other in the immediate presence of an animated being with 'scintillating eyes', an artifice or thaumata that is also endowed with prophetic powers.12 Jesse Reiser and Nanako Umemoto recall that daidala were ancient precursors of the relation between language and architecture, explored in their Metier ? aubes. The construction is composed of two reciprocal mechanisms. The first is a revolving paddle wheel composed of five plaques perforated by shapes resembling words. The second is an adjustable steel framework for the suspension, beneath the plaques of the wheel, of a beholder who is invited to make a 'prophecy' out of the disorder of the words. The machine desig? nates the hidden potential of utterance to engage in a kind of pathological game of method, in order to 'discover' meaning. This is paralleled in the word-game technique Raymond Roussel used to create his books, from which the tide of Reiser and Umemoto's work derives. But the sentience associated with the daidala is absent. Or, rather, it is delayed by the beholder, who has yet to ariimate the machine ? a problem also explored, in a psychoanalytic context, by Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio. Where Reiser and Umemoto outwardly seduce the body with ergonomic adjustability, Diller and Scofidio lure the beholder into an act of voyeurism in order AA FILES 24 that his identity may be usurped by another's gaze. Para-site is deployed specifically to 'com? promise the circuit' of encounters between bodies, artefacts and buildings, within the field of the gallery. Owing to the configuration of the angled over? head niirror and the video camera, observers tend to cluster into two groups. One group, those who have just entered the room, tend to gaze from a distance, looking in the mirror in order to view the apparatus itself. The other group, usually just one or two people, approach the apparatus and dis? cover themselves being viewed. The entire con? struction is displaced by a ruthless horizontal sectioning which has sliced apart a wall-mounted chair in order to insert a second, small shaving mirror at the intersection between camera and monitor, crotch and section line. Voyeurism and naked disclosure represent the poles of an oppos? ition which creates an ambiguous pleasure 4 The Skin of the Earth Raoul Bunschoten, 1990 89</page><page sequence="5">Mutier ? aubes Jesse Reiser and Nanako Umamoto, 1987 (Mr &amp; Mrs Martin Wolf, New York) derived from repeating the movement from one to the other. The daidala re-created the sentience which animates the body, in order to express a magical orientation to thought and experience. They de? monstrated, not the power of thought to pen? etrate matter, but the engagement that invites the beholder to react to an invisible order. Para-site and Metier ? aubes, however, have no recourse to the beyond ? they simply are. If the mech? anism was once associated with the magical animation or the elaboration of method which revealed transcendence, now it is more the sign of its loss, in the face of uncertainty, chaos, or incompleteness. This displacement of the subject questions the 'solid gold' of ideal constructs. Rather than the illusion of sentience, one struggles with the question of a self-presence that momentarily takes one into the machine. It is less that the body addressed is a centre which moves only to dominate its surroundings, but that the body is disclosed only by the instruments it may or may not use. The instruments have no final determination, and the question of one's own body engendered in instrumentality also dis? places the certainty of an other (body) whence it was derived. (d) Myth and criticism The loss of ideality in architecture has emerged as a consistent theme in the exhibition, from Gadelha's machines to Para-site. While radical in the realm of architecture, the possibility for this experience of loss to be transformed into a critical position was already anticipated in the work of Mallarme and Duchamp. According to 90 Val6ry, Mallarme* created in the poem 'Un coup de d?s jamais n'abolira le hasard' a 'linguistic machine' which functions in reverse, turning into ideas, rather than ideas into words.13 Duchamp, the most obvious precursor of the Machines, insisted on the relevance of Mal larm?'s approach, but where Mallarme uses the chance arrangement of words to delay the idea, Duchamp's machines, like the Large Glass, run on a motor of negations and ironies. Octavio Paz claims that Duchamp's irony 'suspends' gravity with a reversal that continually moves from crit? icism to myth and back again.14 Owing to the failure of the Idea in modern life, there can only be criticism. But in announcing the end of mod? ernity, criticism heralds a new world, creating a myth. This myth then falls to criticism, and 'the Idea ceaselessly destroys and renews itself.15 As in Mallarm6's poetry, the void of ideality pro? vokes a multiplicity of outcomes. Do the machines operate within the slippage between myth and criticism? Myth creates a pas? sage for meaning which, but for material form, could not exist. Myth remembers the universal resistance of the body, and the gesture that would place it before a world of things and others. Ephemeral, the gesture can be repeated, but while taking name and form it must also submit itself to materiality in order to provide it with an inexhaustible source. Criticism, on the other hand, confounds the wonder of desire and the magic associated with myth, after the physical expression of the mythical order has developed surprising and ironic consequences. In question? ing the notion of intrinsic worth associated with that materiality, criticism becomes a catalyst enabling the ground of myth to be recreated in Para-site Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, 1989 AA FILES 24 self-referential sign systems, which can be ma? nipulated to challenge the predeterminations embodied in myth. Yet, in delaying the outcome of the acts being questioned, the consequences of the acts themselves assume the self-evidence of mythical form. Hence value cannot be dis? connected from the reappearance of intrinsic worth, promising redemption only in a future that is forever delayed by critical thought. (e) Hard cash: a myth One might explore this paradox further with the notions of deferral which are associated with deconstruction. But the language which has made deferral most familiar, and most threat? ening, is the language of money. Using a se? quence of radical shifts related to the notion of 'zero' or 'nothing', the mathematician Brian Rotman describes in his study Signifying Nothing how Western notions of value, especially money, have finally been stripped of any refer? ence to the intrinsic worth from which they supposedly derive. Rotman parallels the Toss' of the metaphysics of presence which is posed by deconstruction with the replacement of the gold standard by a self-referential system of ex? changes based on the dollar.16 If there can be no promise of prior worth, the redemption of value is 'scheduled' into the future, in the futures markets, where the dif? ference between spot (current) rates and forward (future) rates of exchange of all goods is treated as a commodity. Goods are invested with the value of signs, and signs can then be traded as goods. In value-systems depending on notions of zero, the movement from object to sign is eventually reversed. A kind of hierarchy of sig</page><page sequence="6">nifying relations is created within the field of signs, which becomes both the source of reality and the means of describing it in &lt;objective, terms. We question the familiar picture of the given world, as it becomes no more than the sign representing that which it cannot be prevented from meaning. In this way, there is a movement between prophecy and criticism, between engendering and disruption. While the denial of anteriority disrupts the notion of a transcendental signifier, this disruption becomes the only way to create value. The whole notion of the 'Idea' is questioned by these techniques. No longer the producer of identical copies based on an ideal archetype or model, this speculative 'machine' continually mortgages its future appearance. Its products are offered as the promise of a 'yet-to be' which is continually deferred by the myth of hard cash. if) The bearer of absence Are the Machines d'Architecture signposts point? ing to a new form of architectural currency? This proposition could be tested by inquiring, again, for whom this currency would be intended. With money, the displacement of value from gold, to paper, to the notional money of currency ex? changes has resulted in the development of a radically new form of subjectivity which is able to signify absence ? first, the absence both of intrinsic worth (gold) and the subject (specific bearer), then of the whole question of actual worth and subjectivity. In the Machines d 'Archi? tecture, that effacement is posited by the critique of architectural conventions. But the exhibition reinvents the loss resulting from a displacement that 'futures' value through a zeroing of ideality, notions of site, and archi? tectural codes. Architecture re-creates itself as myth. A subject is engendered who is able to signify the loss as a function of identity; but this negation questions the subject and his assump? tions of centrality and of address. The notion of emptiness, conventionally equated with physical space, and the problem of what the architect should do with it (in structure, enclosure) can now be reformulated. A mythical time is engen? dered; 'space' becomes linked to the topoi cir? cumscribed in the attempt to name the world, but it can be neither fully disclosed nor completed. Speculation cannot, however, finally abolish the illusion of value guaranteed by the sign of anteriority. Donald Bates and Ken Rabin explore this in the notion of an 'Architectural Encyclo? paedia'. Sections of it appear in the form of text in the exhibition catalogue, in large prismatic constructions of medium-density fibreboard and steel, and in collages and drawings. The text con? sists of a stream of tragic displacements encoun? tered in the opposition between Nature and Spirit, each concluded with a statement of the 'pain' of the silence broken by the utterances that both initiate and defer the 'unitary quest'.

View of model closed (above) and open (below). The Garden of Love and Fire constitutes itself as a sign of a new city ? place which emblematically and physically marks a moment of spirituality in space. It makes visible the trace of an apparently invisible conversion: light into object, poetry into number, thought into landscape. It is an expression of the fact that the garden is only the number of our existence made audible to the soul. The garden consists of an observation platform, three narrow water canals, and a fourth dry channel on which an oblong volume is resting. These lines direct themselves towards three particular locations: Salamanca, Paris and Aimere. They signify a world location in which love (Juan de la Cruz) and fire (Paul Celan) intersect in Almere's future. The inscribed ciphers refer to the encounter between Juan de la Cruz and Paul Celan in the newly reclaimed land. They become readable at precisely those times when the materiality of forms dissolves into oblivion. The meditation garden itself is formed by a prism supporting a number, an empty wedge, and a transparent plane. On the occasion of humidity change (fog), the garden projects light through the 92 transparent plane which is inscribed with a graphic 'anniversary' image. The light illuminating the surface becomes a trace of 'lost light', as well as the manifestation of nature and construction. The entire ensemble is governed by a column of light, sometimes visible, sometimes not, which gives body to itself through fog. The shape, function, mechanism and character of the garden seek to reveal that we are surrounded by a world full of amazing and powerful signs whose laws are intimated but cannot be unravelled. The meanings which reach us are those of an accidental encounter with fragments of our own awareness. The displacement between form and function opens a gap in the text, date and atmosphere, which transforms the notion of space from that of domination to that of an uncontrollable anniversary. The garden evokes an unresolved tension which sensibility conjures in a play whose conclusion is unreadable yet consecrated. The twenty-first-century garden is one in which cosmic laws momentarily do appear before the lover of nature, but only to manifest that the fire-inspired head of the universe is perpetually turning. Bates and Rabin, the catalogue itself introduces the problem of the machine?the question of dis? semination or accompanying protocol which is 'cashed in' for the 'thought' that guarantees the work. If the catalogue is the machine, then per? haps the objects and the exquisite collages are its products; at the same time, the text cannot do without the 'solid gold' of the work itself. But, if the inversion between textual authentication and intrinsic value is taken further, then a subsequent move would eliminate the objects altogether in preference to the text itself. The irony is that this move would call for its negation by demanding the return of the objects in order to ground the text in 'real work'. Deferral emerges in a still more radical form in the work of Daniel Libeskind. The exhibition included the Garden of Love and Fire (for the Dutch polder town of Almere, and reminiscent of his Chamber Works), Intermundium XIII and Theatrum Mundi, a series of collaged drawings. If Hejduk has introduced the problem of absence experienced within the subject, of the subject which is able to signify absence, then Libeskind has converted Hejduk's sign into a new zero, thus completing the circuit. While he works with many of the 'silent accomplices' of architecture (machines, drawing techniques, now even buildings) to establish the authority of a sign, this sign has no anteriority in an a priori world that is without signs. At one level, for example, his work signifies by means of the absence of archi? tectural codes, beginning as early as the Micro megas and gradually shedding formal relations until the Theatrum Mundi drawings, where all reference to the tools of the architect seem to have been abandoned in preference to almost calligraphic marks. By completing, or closing, the signs of loss in architectural codes, he creates a new sign which is capable of signifying the absence of the signs of architecture. This makes possible a range of projects which, while replete with stylistic borrowings and philosophical presences, seems to have 'come from nowhere', and to have only the most obscure intellectual antecedents. At another level, the work engenders a subject who is capable of signifying not only absence, but the absence of the absence ? in other words, of eliminating altogether the problem of address (and thereby effacement). Despite the chain of removals, some form of subjectivity must still exist in order to perceive the problem. A radical effacement results, in so far as architecture 'should' address anyone. While this is a disrupt? ive event, it is posed as a positive architectural construct (a structured series of drawings, a garden for Almere, etc.), creating a paradoxical autonomy for the observer's relation to the work. Libeskind's work schedules itself into the future. It becomes a kind of prophecy ? enigmatic marks, drips ? whose meaning is always 'yet-to be'. At the same time, the work refuses to turn away from this slippage into the future, which AA FILES 24</page><page sequence="8">can also be read as the loss of an a priori truth, required to guarantee the subject a place in the world. ][ But the closure of an architectural 'zero' is still more radical than parallel developments in de construction or monetary systems. While these rely on unquestioned mechanisms of dissemin? ation and registration (paper is blank, printing presses operate, efficient systems ensure that critics' books can be sold at a profit), the closure of 'zero' in architecture, on the other hand, threatens to disrupt the framework of codes at the level of ground ? the matrix of reality that binds us to the world. This notion of architecture can? not commodity its future. Instead, architecture is transferred into the problem of the loss of those codes that (once) guaranteed intrinsic worth. This is because the work points to an instability in conventional techniques. These make a com? modity of an existing condition of inhabitation and architectural value, so that any encounter with the unimaginable (associated with real hazard) is reduced to the insurable. This happens not only to property, but also to the currency of ideas disseminated in the architectural press as a system of graphic icons and order words, which can be 'cashed in' to grant the user credibility. At this level the conventional approach to archi? tecture becomes a floating decimal place, an empty shell that can bank on itself or foreclose, like any other financial instrument. By corn modifying its own future, it ceases to operate in the realm of exchanges with which we create value inter-subjectively. If we are bereft of a true and authentic source ? a 'given world' ? then a construct of value must always depend on a difference projected into the future and is increasingly separated from material presences. This introduces a paradox in the architect's attempt to make a proposition. On the one hand, the value of that proposition can only be determined in terms of an unreachable 'later date', denying the chance to 'pay off the debt with what is valued in the present in order to fix ground. On the other hand, the proposition can only be created in the present. This paradox is the ironic motor of the Machines, moving between the problem of a realized ideality, and the drift of fabrication and lived experience. Hence there can be no escape from the actual act of construction. While all the pieces deny any fixed and final idea, they are none the less very precisely formulated, characterized by exquisite attention to detail and the careful use of materials. While ground shifts, different between moments as well as places, between the Machines d'Architecture the ground is always here and real. It has been pointed out that the relation between text and money evolves from forms of exchanges governing pledge, duty, honour and so on.17 But if these constructs were once rooted AA FILES 24 in preconceptions of descent, origin ? that is, a site ? then the conventional relation between architecture and ethical responsibility is rad? ically challenged. Our dis-ease with fixed and idealized systems has exposed an endless deferral of authentic experience. The displace? ment demands a new approach to problems of ground, responsibility and legitimacy in the making of architecture. We must ask ourselves what constitutes the practice of architecture. Is it to be defined by the codes given in prevailing methodologies? What constitutes the respons? ibility of the architect? How can the architect address the displacement of ground which char? acterizes experience? Ideas and essences have become ironies, tropes behind the illustration of the real. Hence the technology of the Machines works in an inverted way; with no predetermined value or practical function, they negate the will to power expressed by contemporary tech? nology. Rather than attempt to solve the problem of inhabitation with an endless stream of replicas, they emit singularities, holes in the thought that finds the matter before it wondrous and impenetrable. The Machines d'Architecture lead astray but, while they suggest that we may never compre? hend reality, they can act as prophecies which encourage us to change it. We question the meaning of the pieces in the same way that we question the meaning of the world: the beholder is obliged to take the experience seriously and to speculate, to become the architect of his or her own experience. We become the unknown that completes the work, the shadow of the other without whom no experience of community can be achieved. Deferral creates its own site out of the question that keeps architecture adrift. The parasite be? comes the host; architecture questioned, returns to question. Displaced, the architect becomes a nomad, or exile, homeless but always in search of home. This is an event, not of something, but itself the slippage that delays any final meaning in thought or material, any finality in the antici? pation of the architectural. It is to create the astounding moment when ground ruptures and the unfinishable is momentarily completed by the unimaginable. 'Space' is discarded, to create a whole new problem of site (which is elsewhere), proposition (which moves), field (which is frag? mented, shifting), subjectivity (which is hetero? geneous/questioned); always the question of how we invent the world and how to position our? selves in it.
