<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMONG THE NEW WORDS JOHN ALGEO ADELE ALGEO University of Georgia Athens, Georgia With the assistance of the New Words Committee A A RECENT MEETING of the Southeastern Conference on Linguistics at the University of Georgia, Virginia McDavid in her plenary speech looked back on fifty years of work in dialectology and lexicography. During the question period, she was asked about the most prolific source of new words in present-day English. Without a moment's hesitation she replied, "Computers." This installment of "Among the New Words" supports that answer by looking particularly at words connected with the Internet. With computer terms it is often hard to decide which are technical jargon and which are general English. Some of the entries below may seem both technical and jargonish; however, we have citations of their use in general publications. We are grateful for citations illustrating these terms from Thomas Algeo, Ronald R. Butters, George S. Cole, Steve A. Demakopoulos, Ludwig Deringer, Gaelan T. de Wolf, Frederick S. Holton, Jaan Ingle, Betty Irwin, William J. Kirwin, Anton Lysy, William Metzger, Frank Nuessel, Linda Rapp, Charles Silbereisen, Russell Tabbert, Robert S. Wachal, and Gregory Williams. agent n INTELLIGENT AGENT 1994Jan 17 Newsweek 58/1 Agents were not much more than a futurist's dream until the Winter Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas last week. There, a Silicon Valley company, General Magic Inc., an- nounced the development of a software called Telescript that includes features that may someday become the butlers of the digital age. Mar 21 Wall StreetJour R19/5 Software suppliers could be in the driver's seat. Without guides and navigation programs, consumers will have trouble finding their way through myriad entertainment choices. So-called agent programs are expected to learn their preferences and highlight offerings. 1995 Feb 27 Business Week 82/1 While AT&amp;T says the system will eventually handle such tasks as doing your online shopping, at first the agents will do simpler chores, such as routing E- mail messages. Feb 27 Newsweek 76/2 Wildfire is part of a general trend toward cyberservants, or information "agents," that can, according to pre- scribed rules, help bring order to our lives. As they are envisioned by computer scientists, within the next decade agents will be our alter egos, culling informa- tion for us, reading, sorting and sending e-mail on our behalf, placing calls and performing dozens of routine tasks. bot formative [robot] Device or computer program that automatically con- ducts searches or executes commands without step-by-step directions from the user; as in CANCELBOT, ENDOBOT, INFOBOT, KNOWBOT bozo button n [cf bozofilter, ANW Winter 1994] Device in a computer program to eliminate Internet messages from specified sources 1994 May 19 Atlanta Constitution C3/2 Atlanta Computer Currents magazine lists hundreds of small, 303</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN SPEECH 70.3 (1995) local BBS operations.

A new generation of more efficient browsers should help make the Web acces- sible to everyone. 1995 Feb 19 Chicago Tribune sec 7 5/5 By 1994, however, computer scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign had transformed the Lynx browser into software that presented the same sort of graphical displays as one sees with Microsoft Windows or the Macintosh screen displays. [?] They named it Mosaic. Feb 23 USA Today D4/1 Prodigy won't give figures, but bolstered by its new World Wide Web Internet browser, it had its "largest growth month in history" in January, says spokesman Brian Ek. Feb 27 Business Week 80/1 As Web use has exploded-there are now 27,000 Web sites, and the population is doubling every 53 days, according to Sun Microsystems Inc.-Web browsers have become an overnight software sensation. Millions of copies of Mosaic, the original Web browser, have been distributed for free over the Net. Mar 20 Newsweek 43/3 The monster of browsers, nicknamed "Mozilla" (created by most of the NCSA people who brought us the original Mosaic), is the slickest browser on the market. Many of its charms come from its superior speed, a trick accomplished by letting you see part of a file while it continues to retrieve what remains. It's used for 75 percent of Web browsing and can be downloaded free from the Net. Apr 3 Chicago Tribune sec 4 4/2 These brows- ers are the key to what's happening today, though what role they will play a few years down the line is anyone's guess. []1 By using a mouse and on-screen icons, browser users get easy access to the Internet-whether through newsgroups, gopher searches, e-mail or any of the other network tools. cancelbot n [cancel + robot] Software that searches the Internet for targeted files, such as commercial mass mailings, in order to delete them; also CANCELLER ROBOT 1994 Jul 25 Time 48/1 [picture caption] SPAMMERS VS.

Siegel Chicago Tribunesec 1 15/2 Nowhere are cyberspace difficulties more evident than in the inevitable swing toward Internet commercialization. The widely reported turf war rages on between academic factions, which controlled the Internet before it went public, and business newcomers who now want access to Internet's huge audi- ence. Electronic attacks on business people by means ranging from computer insults (called flames) to assorted forms of electronic vandalism persist uncon- trolled. Worst of all are the "canceller robots," computer programs meant to erase the communications of anyone hackers (who usually launch them) wish to silence. 304</page><page sequence="3">AMONG THE NEW WORDS CAVE, cave n [Cave Automated Virtual Environment] Small room in which are projected images which, when viewed with spectacles, appear as three dimensional for virtual reality research 1994 Aug 29 Newsweek 10/1-2 Virtual reality generally requires wearing a cumbersome helmet and glove, and VR environments tend to move sluggishly. But the Cave Automated Virtual Environ- ment, a hit at this year's SIGGRAPH computer-graphics convention, doesn't have these problems. The CAVE, a room 10 feet on a side, projects images onto two walls and the floor. Wearing glasses to see the images in 3-D, scientists use CAVEs to simulate data-heavy experiments-anything from drug design to gravity waves. Sep 12 Chicago Tribune sec 4 1/2-4 [picture caption] Argonne National Laboratory's Frank Fradin, Rick Stevens and Alan Schriesheim exam- ine machine components using a "cave," which is an advanced electronic display environment that will allow groups to design in 3-D. Ibid sec 4 5/1 The cave is a room where two walls consist of movie display screens. High-resolution projec- tors create images on the two wall screens and on the floor in front of people who stand in the cave. [?] To experience virtual reality, people wear glasses with liquid crystal display lenses that admit light in a cycle of 48 times a second. The glasses' cycle is coordinated with the computer generating images by means of infrared signals sent from boxes stationed at the cave's perimeter. [1] Images shown on the walls and floor of the cave appear as three-dimensional objects in the center of the room when processed through the glasses. People in the cave can turn an object over, move it around and examine it from any angle. [1] Everyone wearing the glasses sees the object from the perspective of the person holding the electronic control wand. c-mail n [commercial mail (modeled on e-mail)] Commercial messages dis- tributed over the Internet for a fee by Prodigy 1995 Feb 19 Chicago Tribunesec 2 4/2 The Prodigy online service also prohibits independent unsolicited e- mail.
