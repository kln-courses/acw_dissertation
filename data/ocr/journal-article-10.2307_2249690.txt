BAILLIE'S object in this important and welcome collection of essays is to study certain characters of human nature for their own sakes, and with- out the bias which interest in a particular theory might give. But his choice of topics was directed by an interest in the question of the limita- tions of the intellectualistic attitude which many philosoplhers adopt. What does an unbiassed examination of the facts of human nature tell uts of the function of thought in human life, of its relation to the other lhuman activities, and of the nature of its object ? Setting out with suclh a problem, Prof. Baillie would naturally be led to a series of studies such as those in the present volume. His answer is on the whole disintegrating; thouglh the chapter on "Philosophy in Human Nature " shows that, for the author, philosophy lhas an extremely important function. The postulate that the world is rational is not borne out either by the success of any single philosopher, or by common agreement among philosophers, or by a steady development within philosophy itself. The implication that rationality is the most important and desirable phase of human nature is contradicted by the facts of human nature. " Human life is not a scientific enterprise, nor the universe a mere riddle for philosophers " (11). The rationalistic atti- tu(le toward the universe characterises only a smiall number of men, re- stricted within narrow limiits of space and time, liaving their habitat just like certain types of fish or tree. This view is confirmed by an examination of thought itself, of the language and concepts which are thought's instrumiient, and of the non- logical factors by which thought is guided and sustained. Thinking is a human process, just like seeino ; and just as seeinig is conditioned by the niature of our eyes, so thinking is conditioned by the nature of our intel- lect. Our intellect shows itself in the kind of languagre, the sort of con- cepts, we construct for the systematisation of reality; and if cur intellect were diffUrent, our constructions would be different. In this result Prof. Baillie seems to be perfectly consistent. The argument that awareness which involves the human organism is conditioned by that organism, while den-ied by some, is often accepted as self-evident. It appears to us to be a very comnplex question, involving many considerations. But if it is to be accepted anywhere, then consistency seems to insvolve that we should accept it in relation to thought. Prof. Baillie remnarks that the processes leading to error aie not in any way different froin those leading to truth, and( that hence the results cannot (litfer in kind in the two cases. As a oonsequence, reality is regarded everywhere as intimiiately bound up with inan's activities. There is no reality external to man for man to know; an-d thus knowing is not an attempt to get into touch with the nature of something whose nature is independent of nan. Knowing becomes atn attenpt on the part of man to find satisfaction thirough the activity of one aspect of himself. Truth is anthropomorphic.</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 99 This is not all. If it were, it could still be maintained that knowing is man's central activity, and tllat systemnatic completeness of knowledge is the goal of the process. Prof. Baillie denies this. Knowing is con- ditioned by certain non-logical factors-emotion, memory, and imagination are the chief-which restrict its activities and determine its essential function. Whether the intellect shall be active or not, in what directions it shall work, how far its activities shall go, depend on the emotional re- sponse to the environrnent, on the accuracy and width of memory, on the imaginative penetration, of the searcher; and these things differ with different men. Prof. Baillie would conclude, not that the existence of the search shows that there is an objective independent of man to be aimed at, but rather that the search is relative to the searcher. His courageous workingf out of this position is extremely valuable as pointing a fruitful direction for those who regard knowina as a good in itself, but who have felt disheartened by tlle apparent inability of knowing, to acllieve a syste- matic view of the universe. Even the logical factors involved in knowing-and for these Prof. Baillie simply refers us to "current logic "-differ in different miien. Men differ in their senlse of what is clear or self-evident, consistent or inconsistent; in the reach, complexity, subtlety and precision, of their intellects ; and thuis it would be absurd to expect any measure of agreement in the ulti- mate intellectual attitude of different men. (The difficulty here is to see how to understand the "logical" factors. If Prof. Baillie's view is correct, then a radically different view of the logical factors from that of the current logic seems necessitated.) The way of intellect is simply one of the ways in which mnan seeks self-satisfaction; and it is to be considered as parallel in its nature to art and morality. They and it react on one another, and are to be regarded as organically related parts of man's whole nature, which seeks, not the self-coinpleteness of any aspect, but -rowth through complete activity. This general attitude (expressed in Essays I., III., VI., VII., VIII.) is confirmed in detail by the accounts of perception, judgment and infer- oence (in the second essay), of memory (in Essay IV.) and of emotion (Essay V.): where it is contended that each aspect of the self makes its own unique and distinctive contribution to knowledge, which cannot be set aside in the interests of the contribution of any other aspect, and that hence the ideal of systematic completelness cannot be supreme. He speaks occasionally of his view as involving, an appeal to intuition, but intuition means more than the simple fact that each aspect of the self stands on its own feet and claims ultimacy within its own sphere. In- ttuition is bound up with feeling. He speaks (82) of the emotional thrill witlh which man responds to selected parts of his environment as " one of the most mysterious manifestations of mental life," and (61) of the full joy, the complete sense of fulfilment, which successful thinking brings; and it is in the light of such statements that we should read the brief account of intuition on page 74, as the final operation of the mind in know- ing, "inseparable from feeling and carrying the sense of completed mental activity or free self-fulfilment ". It is this state of mind which is the groal of knowledge, and not " a system of thoughts outside the mind This whole view, dealing as it does with the most important of all the philosophical problems of to-day, is expounded with reinarkable lucidity and vigour. The account of certain non-logical factors in knowledge is the most careful and balanced statement we have yet seen on this subject. There is an illuminating final essay on "Laughter and Tears'" whicl treats the subject of laughter in close relation with its opposite. A companion series of studies, dealing withl morality and citizenship,</page><page sequence="3">100 NEW BOOKS. is foreshadowed in the preface. Readers of the present volume will look forward to its companion with great interest. LEONARD RUSSELL. The Moral and Social Significance of the Conception of Personality. By the late ARTHUR GEORGE HEATH, M.A., sometime Fellow of New College, Oxford, and Lieutenant in the 6th Batt. Royal West Kent Regiment. Oxford: at the Clarendon Press, 1921. Pp. viii, 159. Price 7s. 6d. All who have read the Letters of Arthur George Heath, and the brief but fitting memnoir by Prof. Gilbert Murray which prefaced them, must have realised, even if they did not know him in life, that his death on the field of battle robbed Oxford and New College of a singularly fine character and a mind rich in promise of distinction. They will turn with more than ordinary interest to this short essay, which gained the Green Moral Philosophy Prize in 1914, and which has now been given to the world by his friends and literary executors, notwithstanding the fact that Heath himself, before sailing for France, advised against its being published as it stands. The decision to override Heath's own judgment must have been a grave and difficult one, but there is good reason to feel grateful to the editors for their courage. True, the essay, as they recognise, "will not win for its author the reputation as a philosopher which he would have attained if he had lived to complete his life's work " (p. iv), but it helps one to understand the trend of philosophical thought among the younger generation of Oxford teachers, and it shows Heath's freshness and independence in the handling of a well-worn topic. Oxford, it is clear, is turning away from the idealism of Green and Caird, Bosanquet and Bradley. Even Plato is mentioned only to be criticised. The-dominant character of this reaction is, broadly, " realistic ". In the theory of knowledge, its leaders insist upon the distinction between the act of knowing and the object known. In political theory, they protest.against the "exaltation of the State," against the "social mysti- cism" which ascribes to the State a consciousness and personality higher than those of its individual citizens, and expresses itself in Hegers " Es ist der Gang, Gottes in der Welt dass der Staat ist ". In metaphysics, they reject the absolute, especially when conceived as an infinite person, and construe the universe pluralistically as a'society of finite spirits. All these characteristics of a realistic, or at least anti-idealistic, movemlent of thought are to be found in Heath's essay, though from its pred ominantly ethical and political interest the emphasis naturally falls on the second point, viz., the comparative analysis of forms of social organisation as making for the more abundant life of individual minds. " We are persons in order that we may become personalities " (p. 4). " The highest goodness of which we can conceive is only possible . . in the, lives of finite persons " (p. 22). " In the world of spirit the differentiation of personality is final and sufficient " (p. 39). " A society of persons knowing the truth, wishing the good, loving one another and enjoying the fulliess of their lives-such is the ideal of any unsophisticated mind" (p. 50). Sentences like these recur throughout the essay: they strike its keynote.- The following summary, in the author's own words, best gives the total effect: " I wish to establish first that though some moral goodness may be found elsewhere than in persons, its most characteristic forms demand person- ality: that equally the highest goodness of which we can conceive would be personal goodness: that it would further be the goodness of finite personalities who could in no way be absorbed into one another though,</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 101 they could, and necessarily would, live in intercourse with each other: but that this society could not be identified with the State, that the attempts to elevate the State into a moral being higher than any finite individual must fail, and that the divergence between personal development and social duty is in some sense a real fact . . ." (pp. 7, 8). The argument in support of these theses, though rather uneven in quality, improves steadily as the essay proceeds, until it culminates in a really fine and powerful passage in which Heath prophesies that "as civilisation advances the present State must decline, and with it also the economic structure which the State at present partly controls and partly reflects " (p. 150). This decline of " law and politics " is to come about througfh man's aflvance in the control of Nature and of himself. The whole thought reminds one of Spinoza's concept of jus in naturamz, to which, however, Heath does not refer. The State, to him, is not the "supreme form of human organisation " (p. 125), for he restricts the term explicitly to the sphere of power of the " Sovereign Legislature " (ibid.). To the State, so conceived, he does indeed concede the very important functions, of being, in "the common ititerest," the-ultimate court of con- trol over all other forms of social organisation to which its citizens belong; and of exercising the supreme power of coercion (Part VII.). But he insists that many of the forms of social organisation which the State supervises and controls, .g., the family, or the church, realise, as measured by the quality of individuals' thoughts, purposes and feelings, higher moral values than does the State. Incidentally, Heath ma-kes some sound remarks on the relation of the economic to other motives in human con- duct (Part V., ? 2), "and shrewdly points out that the socialiTation of industry would not abolish conflicts of interests, but only alter the machinery for settling them, by substituting the methods of 'the council chamber for the methods of the market (Part VI., ? 3). No doubt, he would have put this point differently, had "direct action" been within his experience. Throughout he is much concerned to argue that the legal concept of the personality of corporations is a mere fiction, lest it be exploited in favour of a metaphysical personification of the State. Everywhere his principle is that " neither in the State nor in the Church nor any lesser grouping can you find a unit, of value higher than the individual personality " (p. 89). In the section on Self-Realisation (Part II.), Heath argues with much point that this concept is too vague to supply a standard for the develop- ment of a man's individuality. So far as it is positive, it calls for breadth rather than depth. But it leaves us helpless in the face of the problem'of harmonising, except by unsatisfactory compromises, such conflicting ele- ments of the ideal as action and contemplation, personal enjoyment or self-cultivatioin and social service. Heath does 'not appear to have noticed that his point here is fundamentally the same as that which Bradley makes in Appearance and Reality, and A. E. Taylor in The Problem of Contd ct, and that it can be used as a premise for conclusions very different from his own. In general, morever, his preoccupation with the ideal of a perfection realised discretely in as many individuals as possible makes him ignore altogether both vicarious suffering and vicarious achievement. Yet it may fairly be held that no analysis, be it of individual persons, be it of social life, which is blind to these two things, does more than scratch the surface. But the weakest portions of the essay, to my mind at any rate, are -Parts I. and II. The foundation of Heath's-whole position is given in this sentence: " it appears to me that we regard nothing as good in itself ex- cept state's of consciousness " (p. 9). This judgment is nowhere discussed. No grounds are given, no elucidations offered. We must interpret it, I</page><page sequence="5">102 NEW BOORS. think, as implying that also nothing is bad in itself except states of con- sciousness. Yet there is nowhere any attempt at a discussion of what con- stitutes -badness and goodness in states of consciousness. If, e.g., we insist on- the distinction between the act of thinking and the object of thought (p. 36), the'question at once arises wheth-er goodness and badness belo.ig to the acts by themselves (which alone, presumably, can be described as " states of consciousness "), or whether they depen-d also on the objects. Moreover, in spite of repeated readings, I cannot make out whether, in Part I., Heath does or does not intend to distinguish between " moral goodness " and other forms of " ultimate value ". He begins by distin- guishing them and enumerates knowledge of the truth, creation of works of art, and pleasure as non-moral values. But, thereafter, the question of the " goodness "\ or " value " of states of consciousness is uniformly treated as if it were exclusively the question of their moral goodness. And this question is further complicated by the distinction between beings who are conscious and beings who are self--conscious. Only the latter, aware of an alien world and capable of memory a4d anticipation, are strictly " persons". Yet persons share with lower animals certain emotions and impulses. And thus the problem- is posed whether these emotions and impulses "can have a place in [moral] goodness " (p. 15) when they occur in self-conscious persons and, again, when they occur in unself-conscious animals. The whole discussion seems lacking in clearness and grip. Of Part II., which contains Heath's arguments against The Idea of Infinte Personality, it is enough to say (1) that, so far as they are polemical (chiefly against Lotze and Bosanquet) they bring nothing new and leave one wondering whether Heath really understood what those whom he criticises seek to express; and (2), that so far as he insists on the value of finite beings, and even of the, imperfections sand limitations of finite beings, he says nothing which an absolutist could not accept, or which could not be paralleled, e.g., from Bosanquet's writings. With the question whether a finite creature is merely finite he does not deal. He simply assumes the affirmative. There is a sentence in the Conclusion- (p. 156) which makes poignant reading. "The feeling in the minds of many sincere and loyal citizens that their country is greater than themselves has to be set aside as mis- leading, although it is quite true that the individual may realise the highest within his powers in self-sacrificing devotion ". Supposing death were an experience which men could survive and learn from, what should we not give to have Heath's own comments on this judgment now that he has himself made the supreme sacrifice for his country? R. F. A. HI. Collected Scientific Papers. By JOHN HENRY POYNTING, Sc.D., F.R.S., Mason Professor of Physics in the University of Birmingham. Cam- bridge: University Press, 1920. Pp. xxxii + 768. Friends of the late-Prof. Poynting-and they are many-will welcome this handsome memorial volume of his scientific papers-which has recently been published by the Cambridge Press. It has been edited by two of his junior colleagues, G. A. Shakespear and Guy Barlow; and interesting biographical and critical notices by Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir Joseph Larmor, Sir J. J. Thomson and G. A. Shakespear, have been inserted as an Introduction. J. H. Poynting was one of the four first professors of the Mason College, Birmingham, opened in 1880 by Huxley (who delivered on the occasion his notable Address on " Science and Culture"'). Poynting had been a student at Owen's College, Manchester, and at Trinity College, Cambridge,</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 103 and was Third Wrangler li the Mathematical Tripos of 1876. He was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity in 1878, and then began in the Caven- dish, Laboratory under Clerk Maxwell a series of experiments on the mean density of the 'earth, which occupied him for some twelve years. When he went to Birmingham in 1880 he had the opportunity of organis- ing a laboratory of his own, and in it one valuable piece of physical research after another was undertaken- until his too early death in 1914, at the age-of sixty-two years. As a physicist he is most widely known through his memoirs " On the Transfer of Energy in the Electromagnetia Field", (Phil. Trans., A, 1884), and "On Electric Currents and the Electric and Magnetic Induction in the Surrounding Field " (Phil. Trans., A, 1888), both of them included in the present volume, the former culminating in what Sir Joseph Larmor describes as "the famous result that will go down to posterity as Poynting's Theorem ". Not only did he succeed in specifying the path of transfer of electric energy from one material system to another, but he was likewise enabled to give for the first time as a very special case the dyn?amical specification of' a ray of light. For some years before his death he devoted a great deal of atten- tion to the problem-xs of radiation and radiation-pressure, and made im- portant contributions to the experimental side of the subject. In these' researches he started with the notion of a beatm of light as a carrier of momentum, as bearing with it a forward push- ready to b-e imparted to, any surface which it meets. Of the- more technical papers which are here collected, I Will only say that many of them give even to an outsider like myself a clearer conception of the directions in which physicists have recently been moving, and of the- tremendous revolution, in physical theories consequent on the discovery of radium, than can readily be obtained elsewhere. But Prof. Poynting inherited from his father (the author of a book, published in 1860, entitled Glimpses of the Heaven that Lies About Us, which in its day occasioned a considerable amount of discussion) an interest in metaphysical inquiry; and in not a few of the essays contained in this volume he is to be found wrestling with the philosophical questions that lie at the bas'is of physics, as also with those questions of philosophical import with which physics may be said to terminate. The Address to Section A of the -British Association in 1899 (pp- 599-612) is, in more ways than one, anticipatory of Whitehead's Address to the same Section in 1916. Poynting here emphatically maintains that the method of physical science consists in searching for likenesses or similarities, in classing together resembling events, and, in thus furnishing a concise account of the motions and changes observed. Physical laws, he urges, are just brief 'descriptions of observed similarities. And he strongly protests (in a manner that reminds one of Lotze) against phrase- ology encouraging the anthropomorphic tendency' to look upon physical laws as though they were expressions of fixed purpose and the resulting constancy of action as though they were commands analogous to legal enactments. E.g., gases are still said to obey or to disobey Boyle's Law, as if it set forth an ideal or perfect gas for their imitation; and radiators to be good or bad, as if it were a duty on their part to radiate well, and as if there Were failures on Nature's part to come up to the proper standard. Nevertheless, both in this Address and'in other papers, Poynting was constrained to admit that a certain amount of anthropomorphism is in science inevitable. The ultimate aim of physical research is, he thought, to, describe sense-data in terms of senme-data. But for science at its present stage to be confined to description of this sort would mean that great and innumerable gaps would be left in our knowledge; and,</page><page sequence="7">104 NEW BOOKS. consequently, the human device of throwing hypothetical bridges across these gaps to connect what would otherwise be detached regions is bound to prevail. A "true physicist," a physicist who was a physicist alone, would, no doubt, be content to describe merely what is observed in the changes of energy, to say, for instance, that so much kinetic energy ceases and that so much light appears, or that so much light comes to a surface and that so much chemical energy takes its place. The human mind, however, abhors discontinuity no less than Nature was once supposed to abhor a vacuum, and accordingly imagines a constitution of matter and modifications of it corresponding to the different kinds of energy, such that the discontinuities vanish, and one form of energy can be pictured as passing into another, while yet remaining the same in kind throughout. Thus, then, deserting the field of perceived fact, the physicist constructs a conception of natural mechanism,-a conception which enables him to explain in terms of motions and accelerations all the various occurrences of Nature. So far, the only foundation which has served him for this mechanical explanation has been the atomic and molecular hypothesis of matter; that is to say, he connects observed conditions and changes in gross visible matter by invisible molecular and ethereal machinery. In other words, "while the building of Nature is growing spontaneously from within, the model of it, which we seek to construct ill our descriptive science, can only be constructed by means of scaffolding frlom without, a scaffolding of hypAtheses " (p. 607). Such hypotheses are in terms of our- selves rather than in terms of Nature, they ate ejective r.ther than objective (e..g , the molecular and ethereal machinery has been designed, so Prof. Poynting believed, partly because our most highly developed sense is that of sight); but, still, the circumstance that the form of a hypothesis may change, as our knowledge extends, lessens in no way its present value as an instrument to aid us in the search for truth. We can recognise to the full how adequately the molecular hypothesis, for example, enables us to group together large masses of fact which, without it, would be scattered apart, and continually enables investigators to formu- late new questions for research. Several of the papers in this volume deal with the molecular theory. No more succinct or lucid account of its history has been written than the article on the " Atomic Theory (Medipaval and Modern)," which is here reprinted (pp. 724-741) from Hastings' Entcyclopwdia, an article which is admirably supplemented by the two shorter papers, entitled " Mole- cules, Atoms and Corpuscles " (pp. 664-672) and " AMysteries of Matter" (pp. 677-681). While consistently maintaining that the theory is only a hypothesis, which it is at least conceivable some other hypothesis may displace, Poynting confessed that it was to him most difficult to suppose even the possibility of giving up the idea of a grained structure of matter whatever may be the nature of the grains. In discussing the latest theory of atomic structure, he expresses doubt as to whether the mass of electrons can be sufficiently accounted for by the magnetic energy of their charges when in motion. Certainly, he argues, all our measure- mients of energy involve the idea of mass, and he makes the suggestion that perhaps the magnetic energy in the space round the moving electron may imply the existence of mass in that space to serve as a seat for the energy. Were this so, the electric theory of mass would only take the mass from the inside of the moving sphere and spread it through the outside space, so that we should come back again to the Boscovich-Faraday conception that an atom is wherever its force acts-not at the centre alone, but spread out through all space. But, from the point of view of physics, Poynting did not see his way to reduce, as he put it, all to force. "W +e think of force as effort. svmbolised by muscular effort: and if we</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 105 lhave force alone, it is difficult to assign meaning to effort acting on effort" (p. 730). In the liaht of these considerations, it is somewhat surprising to finl him contendinag with vehemence that in purely physical inquiries the idea of ' cause ' is quite out of place, and that it would be a gain to clear thinking if we could abolish the word from scientific description (p. 602). For, after all, the idea of 'cause' is surely no more anthropomorphic than is, according, to his own showing, the idea of force; in point of fact, there is little doubt that the primitive representation of a causal connexion is derived like the idea of force from the initiation of moveinent by muscular effort. And if the ultimate aim of physical science is to describe sense- data in terms of sense-data, it is hard to see why 'effort' should be deprived of its significance, for it is as distinctively a sense-datuim as a colour or a sound. The essay on "Physical Law and Life" (pp. 686-698) is in many respects a noteworthy production. Prof. Poyntinog would constitute a sharp antithesis between physical and miiental activity and coul(d not see the remotest likelihood of our ever making out any correspondence between the two. In a physical system, quantitative values can be assigned to the different conditions, and the resulting motion can be foretold from their combination. But we have, he insisted, no such method of ineasurin( motives in the mental life. We have absolutely no means of determining which motive is the ' stronger,' and can only assign suclh strength to that which ultimately prevails. There is, therefore, no kind of analogy in Suchi a procedure to physical measurement. " Every tiine an intention is formed in the mind and a deliberate choice is inade we have an event unlike any previous event. Freedonm of will is a siinple fact, unlike anything else, inexplicable " (p. 687). 1 must not dwell on the acute criticism of Herbert Spencer's views on the foundations of our belief in the inidestructibility of nmatter and the conservation of energy (pp. 588-598), nor on the valuiable Address on "The Growth of tlle Modern Doctrinie of Energy " (pp. 565-575). But, in view of the current discussio-ns on relativity, attention oughlt to be called to the delightful little piece on " Overtaking the Rays of Light" (pp. 552-556), originally published in 1883. Supposing an observer moving from the earth with twice time velocity of ligfht towards Sirius, Prof. Poynting pictures that observer seeing the events of the last ten years, all in the reverse order. The earth will appear to him to go the wrong way round the sun and to rotste the wroIngr way on its axis; rivers will appear to him steadily to flow ul) towards their source, showers or rain to start from the earth and rise towards the clouds; old men will seem to be dying into life, walkingi backwards all their days, growing younger and younger, until at last they are born out of the world as flourishing bcabies, at the mature a(ge of three score years and ten. Query, will the relat vist maintain that presuming this observer had a fair knowledge of physics and physiology he would y et have no inea-ns of -ascertaining whether he were movin(r towards the rays of light or thety were movino towards him ? The volume contains a fine portrait of the author and a comnplete list of his published works. G. DAWEs HIciKs. Psychology and MLy'stical Exper'ience.

His work falls into two Parts and an Introduction. The Introduction, which is the nucleuis out of which, as he tells us, the whole grew, offersa goeneral view of religrious experience. Part I. then treats of Conversioi, while Part II., going: a stage deeper, makes a study especially (f mystic experience and is entitled Introversion. One may gather what has been the generating interest behind the work, readily enough, from the Introduction itself. The Author appears to have gone out to see whether a inystic experience whereof Catholicismii iniaht be regarded as the peculiar custodian could be distinguished effectively froisi the many other things which seemii like it but perhaps are not the same. And throughout its whole course, his thought keeps up wh1at nmight be des- cribed as a very able, or at anyrate a very creditable, running fight with divers irregularities in the way of religious experience both within the Church's pale and without. It would even aIppear at'points that it is the Author's opinlion thalt while the "agnaoostic psychologist," with his merely scientific e(uipinenit, m-way make somiiethirng of the mysticisnm of a Molinos or a Madamne Guyon, of Quakerism or Christian Science, of Buddhism. Theosophy or what not, lie is baffled when confronted by the truie mystic experience of Catholicism. But the Author's acute and leairned defence of his vXiew-s of what constitutes true inystic experience, mnay probably be found of mluclh imiore permanent interest than his etffrt to credit this true inysticismii especially to the Catholic Church. It is an important issue intrinsically, which in his hands takes the characteristically ecclesiastical shlape of a (luestion as regards the respective mnerits of two ways of devotion, n;X_amely Quietism;l and the Prayer of Quiet. Presuning that the formner is the miiother of all disorder, while the latter has the berinnings of true mystic ex)elience in it, he asks what re--lly is the ditlbrence of the two. And the aDnswer arrived at in the introductory chapter covers very Imiuch (f wNhat the Author eventually has to say ahout true mysticismni and false. He finds that in the Prayer (f Quiet the miind is in contact with something genuinely "given," while in Quietism it has only wvorked itself ulp into a certain state. And the criterion by which he makes the distinction is the presence in the one experience atnd the absence from the other of a certain degree of attention. The pre- supposition seems to be that if the soul is dealing with a "given," then that. with which it is occupied will not be nerelyi given to it but will elicit its at- tentiont and activity to somiie degree. There will be somie, however faint. sense of concentratincr on it. There will be atttention, even if passive" attention. Where attention is wholly absent [aIs we should say. where the given is merely given] the experience is a spuiriouIs one. This, the Author surinises, is the case with the Quietists. Quietism - would seem-ii to have passivity without attention, to be a rest in self rather than a rest in God" p. 23). The formilula just quoted contains in nuce the author's substantial criti- cism of all the ways of mystic experience wlhich he regards as miiistakeni, fromn the Protestant variety of - conversion-phenomena" to the religions of the East. There is an inertia in them. Thus lie quotes by way of warning, certain comfortinags froin Falconi (Letter to a Spiritual Daughter) in the matter of the criteria of a true spirit of devotion. "Be careful when doing what I advised you, not to occupy yourself with considering that God is present in your soul and in youir heart. For al- though that is a good thing . . . it would not be to believe it with sufficient simplicity.... Neither worry yourself to know whether your prayer goes well or badly. Don't trifle witll yourself . . . in thinking whether or no you practise the virtues I have marked for youi or other such matters. This would be to occulpy your nmind with these feeble considerations and break the thread of perfect prayer."</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 107 So also MIolinos, "Annihilation to be perfect, should extend to the judgments, actions, inclinations, desiress thoughts, to all the substance of life." And Malaval, "We must think of nothing and desire nothing for as long a time as possible." And again Guyon, "This divine life becomes natural to the soul. - As the soul no longer feels, sees or knows itself, it sees nothing of God, understands nothing, distin- guishes nothing. There is no longer love, light, or knowledge." "Thus," proceeds the Author, commenting on these errers, " a type of con- templation which had so largely contributed to the sanctification (f the companions of St. Chantal was perverted into a system of psychic inertia." And having found in mental inertia the root of the evil he proceeds to find here also a characteristic feature of current non-Catholic systems generally. "We have not only our Quietists to-day," he says, "but we have this in- duced passivity, -this psychic kenosis, as part and parcel of processes employed by spiritists, faith healers, Christian Scientists, New Thought folk, indeed of all seekersafter the psychic- Beyond who are unwillixng to be simple, humble, and obedient. They look to find the Beyond and they find themselves, to their own destruction." A touch of the nastiness of the official ecclesiastic is, we are afraid, inseparable from the tone of this whole book. But it would be a pity to let this or any other adventitious feature conceal from us the importance of the task of distinguishing- true and false in just the pegion where the author is trying to distinguish them. It is fairly plain that there is a good mysticism and a bad, however u-nlikely it is that any one body of people should have a monopoly of the former. But has our Author got hold of the distinction? It is possible that he has. If so, it is highly' unlikely to prove in the end to be a line of distinction between sect and sect of mystics, as he thinks, but simply one between the mysticism which is truly religious and that which is not, a line of distinction 0 falling within all the sects. If this point can' be made, then much interest attaches to the author's religious standpoint. All recipes for the treatment of the soul, whether derived via St. Ignatious or via Freud, would appear to be double- edged weapons, capable of the basest uses as well as the best; and the only guarantee against their detrimental use would seem to lie in the circum- stance that these powers are recognised as being derived from something which is, in somne sense, as our, Author insists, beyond psychology. 'We should at least have the assent of this Author to the view that all psycho- logical medicine must in the last resort be religious; that that which places such instruments as its in the discoverer's hands, must itself power- fully control the discoverer's will, if the discovery. is not ultimately to do harm. J. W. SOOTT. IThe Psychology of Functional Neur-oses. By H. L. HOLLINGWORTHt Associate Professor of Psychology in Columbia Uniiversity. New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1920. Pp.- xiv + 260., No price given. This book is based on ex-perience gained by the author at U.S.A. General Hospital No. 30 during the latter part of the war. This hospital was devoted exclusively to persistent psychoneurotic cases, of which about 1200 consecutive examples were closely studied. Prof. Hollingworth is not a medical man and was not concerned with the treatment of patients. His function as Director of the Hospital Psychological Service seems to.</page><page sequence="11">108 NEW BOOKS. havq been to organise a systematic study of patients by means of intelli- gence tests and analogous methods. The large number of cases available for observation has enabled him to collect a mass of statistical material which cannot fail to be of interest and value to students of the subject. Moreover, as 'he justly observes, the declaration of the armistice about midway in the course of the investigation "constituted, on a wholesale scale entirely unanticipated, a magnificent experiment in psychotherapy. The therapeutic effects of this event were not only observel in the casual way so frequently reported, but quantitative measure was secured of the ,differential effects in the case of the various diagnostic groups." It is not possible even to summarise here the statistical results obtained, which occupy some thirty tables in the book, but it is probable that few more comprehensive surveys of the intelligence and mental age of different types of psychoneurotic have been made, if, indeed, the present data have any parallel at all. Of considerable interest also is the chapter devoted to " Irregularity of Profile " in which it is made clear that psyohoneurotics give test performances which are clearly distinguishable from those of mentally deficient persons, even although the mean score for a number of tests is the say4e in each class. Whereas the mentally deficient show low perform-ances all round, the psychoneurotics produce the same mean result by scoring abnormally low in some tests and quite high in others. They show, in fact, a high degree of 'scattering' and the average deviation of their scores from the median is much greater than for mental defectives. In this way it is possible to arrange types of disorder in a series of which each number approximates more closely to all-round mental deficiency type. The order given by Prof. Hollingworth is: Hysteria, Epilepsy, ,Concussion, Neurasthenia, Psychoneurosis, Constitutional Psychopathy, Mental Deficiency. Provided that we can be quite sure just what we mean by these diagnostic terms it seems as if this method of research might well prove fruitful. Enough has been said to show that the book contains plenty of facts for the student of functional disorders, and it is necessary to pay some attention to the earlier and more theoretical chapters. These, it must be cohfessed. are less satisfactory than those just dealt with. Prof. Hollingworth rightly deplores the tendency observable in some quarters to ta'ke refuge in technical jargon instead of attampting to give true explanatldns of phenomena. He deprecates, not wholly unjustly perhaps, the use of such words or phrases as 'symbolism,' 'regression,' 'transfer of libido, ' siphoning Qf affects,' etc., and proposes to substitute the concept of 'redintegration '-a term borrowed from Hamilton and slightly modified to suit modern psychological thought. By this term is meant the tendency of a single repeated element of a former complex situation to evoke in a psychoneurotic the whole complex reaction which originally corresponded to that situation; as, for instance, when the banging of a door causes a patient to react in every respect as he did in a battle- situation of which shell and gun explosions were ons feature. This mechanism is, 'he thinks, adequate to bear the whole weight of ex- planation in the realm of the psychoneuroses, but this optimistic view will scarcely be shared by psychologists in general. To say that a single element tends to recall the whole of which it once formed a part and to evoke the corresponding complex reaction is a truism which amounts to no more than a re-statement of the Law of Association; it does not in any way explain why, in substantially identical situations, one man should become paralysed, another mute, a third deaf, and a fourth blind, although it makes it easy to understand why, when partially recovered, each should relapse into his own form of derangement for the same apparently inadequate cause. Apart from these and similar oriticisms which seem</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 109 fatal-to the conception as an explanatory hypothesis, there is nothing to be said against the way in which the idea is worked out, and the chapter on the Levels of Redintegration Response is not uninteresting from the point of view of general psychology. It is however for the facts r'ather than for the theories to be found in it that the book will be helpful. W. WHATELY SMITi. Military Psychiatry in Peace aad War. By C. STANFORD READ, M.D. (Lond.). With two charts., London: Lewis &amp; Co., 1920. Pp. vi, 168. Of the many psychological books resultin' from the War, this is one of the best; for the writer is fully- equipped in normal and morbid psy- chology; he has had charge of neurological wards and has visited all the war mental hospitals in France and Great Britain. The book is at once a contribution to the positive study of insanity and an important com- mentary on the " psychogenic origin " of the psychoses. " Those who take up an essentially materialistic standpoint see the essential factors in the toxiins produced by disease and exhaustion, in the inhalations of noxious gases, in the effects of direct or indirect concussion brought about by high explosives. Others believe that the main bulk of the psychoses are psychogenic in origin and look to mental conflict as the great factor to study. I hold this latter view-point and shall endeavour to show that this is as true in the psychoses of war as it is of peace " (p. 25). Dr. Read. first analyses the psychology of the soldier. The chapter is an illuminat- ing practical application of Freudian views. He comments on the con- fusions due to the failure of the academic alienists of the past ta distinguish between the insanities proper and the psycho-neuroses. " Before the Commission which sat to enquire into 'the recruiting problem, in the evidence given by the military authorities, the opinion was freely expressed that if a man was fit enough to do any form of work in civil life, he was fit to do that work in the army. Never was there a greater fallacy. Large numbers of cases which have been returned from overseas with psychopathic symptoms freely illustrate the falsity of this statement. The mental factor has not had anything like the cqnsideration it should have received " (p. 24). These ideas are applied in detail to leading forms of insanity, for example, dementia prsecox, paranoid states,'confusional states, manic depressive states, mental deficiency, alcoholic psychoses, epilepsy and epileptic psychoses, psycho-neurotic disorders, malingering, suicide-all as affected by war conditions. The book is well documented from other researches. From every point of view, it deserves to be placed among the best handbooks of psychiatry. Psychologie de 1'Enfant et Pedayogie Exp&amp;r imentale. By Dr. EnD CLAPAREDE, Professor of Geneva University. Eighth edition, with a complementary preface. Geneva: Kundig, 1920. Pp. 1 + 570. This new edition of Clapar6de's well-known work on educational psychology contains an introduction of considerable length in which the author en- deavours to define clearly his attitude towards his subject. He urges that education mugt be established upon a scientific basis which takes " know- ledge of the child" for a starting-point. Hitherto emphasis has been laid upon the subject taught rather than upon the child to whom it is taught. Thus we discuss whether education 'should be classical, scientific or vocational, and ignore the most important consideration of all, i.e., that</page><page sequence="13">110 NEW BOOKS. no scheme of education can sueceed which is not adapted to the mental and moral life of the child. Claparede deals in detail with current objections against "scientific pedagogy ":- 1. The "common sense " objection that the power of judging ancd weighing educational varues possessed by the ordinary individual is adequate will 'not hold good, 'for on every educational problem that has been proposed " common sense " gives conflicting verdicta. 2. It is true that the best educators are born rather than made; but at the same time the teacher needs exact knowledge of his craft, just as the "born musician '" needs a knowledge of technique in music. 3. Some say that " experience is the best and only school ". What is really required is a knowledge of the way to profit by experience, and that knowledge demands of the teacher a study of the human material with which he has to deal. Clapar'ede points out that the demand for the application of experimrontal psychology to education has come mainly from the teachers themselves, who are of all people the best-acquainted with the defects of the present state of affairs. The book as a whole is by now too well known to need detailed descrip- tion. It contains a vast mass of material, some of which is perhaps rather uncritically reported, but most of which is interesting. The presentation is clear, and what general discussion is entered upon is for the most part extremely well-conducted. It may safely be said that there is hardly another book which contains so much information of use to the psycho- logically-minded toacher; and the information given is always expressed in a most attractive and suggestive manner. F. C. B. Pers6nlichheit' und Weltcanschauuny: psychologische Untersuchungen zn Religion, Kunst tund Philosophie. By RICHARD MiTLLER-FrEIEENFEIS. Leipzig and Berlin: B. G. Teubner,. 1919. Pp. iii, 274. This work, which the Preface assures us was substantially complete when the War broke out, is a singularly well documented and persuasive plea for -what the author calls 'psychological relativism,' meaning thereby what is otherwise known as personalism or humanism. It aims at showing "to an extent not hitherto attempted, that a man's Weltanschaunng is the -necessary result of the psychological endowment his life reveals " (p. 264). It attains its aim by distinguishing a number of psychological types and tendencies, such as men of feeling, action and tholught, depressed and exalted, dynamic and static, aggressive and pacific, visualising, audile and motor, concrete and abstract, pluralistic and monistic, types, tracing their manifestations historically in the actual lives and works of artists, philoso- phers and religious leaders, and concluding with a more detailed study of the personality of Luther, Goethe, Wagner, Diirer, and Kant, and its influence upon their work. The book is well written, and makes out its case. It should prove a valuable corrective -of the one-sided, fanatical and ex- aggerated ' absolutism' that was rampant in the German philosophic world before the War, all the more on account of its conciliatory, and even apologetic, tone. At -the same time the author contends that his Telativism is not scepticism; it merely recognises the facts that truths for man are not absolute, that no single doctrine is valid for literally all and that the various ultimate attitudes towards the world are irrefutable, and appeal variously to different characters, and it leaves open the possibility that the total truth may eventually be composed by collecting together the personal views of all (p. 273). He might well have added two more</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS. 111 points; one that absolute agreement, if it were possible, would yield a world dull ancd intolerable, like a chorus in which every member sang precisely the same note, the other that the greater the variety of views tolerated, the greater and more certain would be the selection of those that had superior value, either intrinsically or relatively to the personalities to which they appealed. F. C. S. SCHLLER. Fugitive Essays. By JOSIAH RoycE, with an introduction by Dr. J. LOEWENBERG. Harvard University Press, 1920. Pp. 429. Most of these essays-all, in fact, except the last three of them-were written between 1879 and 1882. As the reader of James's Letter s will remember, Royce, at this period, was a young man of less than thirty, eagerly sharpening his philosophical spurs, but feeling himself cabined within the immensities of the Pacific coast, and complaining, indeed, that he was 'the solitary philosopher between Behrings' Strait and Tierra del Fuego'. 'The World Spirit,' however, to quote him once more, ' found him at his tasks in a certain place that looks down upon the Bay of San Francisco,' and was so far propitious to him as to see to the publication of most of these essays. Indeed, it found a home for some half a dozen of them locally in The Californian and in The Berkeley Quaarterly. Neither the editor of these essays (Dr. Loewenberg, of Berkeley, whose piety as a Californian blends with his admiration for Royce's life work and reaches a point not far short of idolatry) nor anyone else would claim that these Fugitive Essays attain the level of Royce's mature work. What is claimed for them is that they are valuable in themselves, since Royce 'simply could not be trivial,' and that they show a very interesting and signal continuity in the progress of Royce's philosophy. The editor at- tempts to demonstrate this continuity in a valuable but slightly ponderous introduction of some forty pages, and he certainly succeeds in giving chapter and verse for his opinions, although he seems, to the present writer, to read somewhat more into his extracts than they can legitimately bear. Opinions, no doubt, will differ concerning the value of the essays themselves, and some may even think that it is always a sound rule to leave the ephemeral and comparatively immature work of distiinguished nen in the obscurity which the authors have not seen fit to disturb. On the other hand, Royce was so clearly one of the great leaders in the thought of a continent, and so responsive to the ideas of his time, that the history of his philosophical development has a great deal of signifi- cance for the whole story of American philosophy in the generation before the war, and these essays are very welcome on this account. Royce hirn- self wished for no formal biography, apparently because he thought that biographies of the usual kind are only impertinent chronicles of irrelevant accidents. What counted, he thought, was a man's work and a man's mind. But he had a high respect for history, and he would have been the last to belittle any attempt to illustrate the way in which the World Spirit seizes hold of those it has chosen. JOHN LAIRD. Thie Moral and Politic(al Philosophy of John Locke. By STIRLING POWEr LAMPREciT, Ph.D. New York: Columbia University Press, 1918. Pp. viii, 168. This work comprises three books, which treat respectively of (1) The tra- ,dition in moral and political philosophy before the time of Locke; (2)</page><page sequence="15">112 NEW BOOKS. The moral philosophy of Locke; (3)'The social and political philosophy- of Locke. In the introductory book Hobbes and Filmer are dealt with at. some length, the remaining chapters being devoted to a more general ex- position of the current conception of the ' law of nature' and of the views of the seventeenth century Deists in their bearing on ethics. This cannot be regarded as a complete account of the historical setting of this aspect of Locke's Thought, and it is to be regretted that Dr. Lamprecht did not see his way to deal more fully with the theories of Cumberland and the Cambridge Platonists in this country and with Grotius and Puffendorf among continental thinkers, to none of whom is there more than an oc-- casional reference. The exposition here given of Locke's moral philosophy is the most elaborate attempt which has yet been made to elucidate his thought on this subject. The writer has made a careful study of his text and has, done, well to supplement the sbanty indications of the Essay by reference' to Locke's minor writings, including his answers to some of his early' critics. But while he thus presents us with all the relevant materials, he does not seem to me to be equally successful in his interpretation of them.. Locke's ethical theory on the face of it contains elements which are not usually found in combination and are not easily reconciled. Under such circumstances the Arst business of the historian is to endeavour to ascer- tain how the different elements were related to each other in his own thought. Only when this has been done can the degree of coherence at- tained be profitably discussed. We may not be able at the end, iu Dr. Lamprecht's words, "to fit all he said into one harmonious whole," but we are not driven to the alternative of supposing that; he committed himself to a number~ of different and inconsistent positions, which he' never thought of relating to each other. On the contrary, it seems clear' that the different elements of his theory were regarded by him as comple- mentary to each other. Thus, while maintaining that the essential part of morality was demonstrable in a manner analogous to that of mathe-- matics, he held that the abstract cognitions thus obtained possessed in themselves no motive force, and moreover lacked the essential element of' obligatoriness until they were brought into relation to the divine will. On the other hand, it was equally vital to his position that 'the content of the divine will is to this extent ascertainable by the u5e of reason. I can fitid no basis whatever for the suggestion that moral distinctions were at times regarded by him'as the products of arbitrary will, or for the view that the nature of virtue was sometimes thought to be determined b-y the' feeling which he took to be the only possible motive for its pursuit. In his account of "the content 'of Locke's rationalistic ethics," Dr. Lam- precht distinguishes three forms of his theory, according to which morality' is based on (1) The consideration of mixea modes; (2) The Law of Nature ;. (3) The idea of God. But here, again, (1) and (3) were not for Locke alternative theories, but complementary aspects of any complete moral doctrine, while the very, conception of a Law of Nature implied for him that it was both ascertainable by reason and an expression of the divine' will. When we pass from Locke's ethics to his social and political philosophy, the materials become of course much more ample. Dr. Lamprecht de- votes separate chapters to Locke's conception of the State of Nature, his theory of political society and his views concerning toleration and punish- ment. Of each of these he gives a clear and adequate account. J. G.</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS. 113 Received also S. Alexander, Spinoza and Time, London, G. Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd., 1921, pp. 80.
