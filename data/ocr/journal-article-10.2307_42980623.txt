She bends and twists, deflecting the swords of our foolishness; our arrogance; our gluttony; our deceit.

Filled with unruly discontent, we yearn to dominate her mysteries; reducing her to microscopic dust, we spit upon her sacredness, tempting the fury of her seas.

And still, we spin ungodly tantrums of injustice against her love, against ourselves, against one another. When will we remove blindfolds from our eyes? When will we stretch our arms - to her? When will the cruelty of our hatred cease; teaching us to abandon the impositions of patriarchy and greed? Oh! that we might together renew our communion with the earth. She, the cradle of humanity. She, the nourishment of our seeds. She, the beauty of our singing. She, the wailing that precedes. - Darder (2008) It is fitting to begin my words about Richard Kahn's Critical Pedagogy , Ecoliteracy y and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement with a poem. The direct and succinct message of The Great Mother Wails cuts through our theorizing and opens us up to the very heart of the book's message - to ignite a fire that speaks to the ecological crisis at hand; a crisis orchestrated by the inhumane greed and economic brutality of the wealthy. Nevertheless, as is clearly apparent, none of us is absolved from complicity with the devastating destruction of the earth. As members of the global community, we are all implicated in this destruction by the very manner in which we define our- selves, each other, and all living beings with whom we reside on the earth. Everywhere we look there are glaring signs of political systems and social structures that propel us toward unsustainability and extinction. In this historical moment, the planet faces some of the most horrendous forms of "man-made" devastation ever known to humankind. Cataclysmic "natural</page><page sequence="3">Preface xi disasters" in the last decade have sung the environmental hymns of planetary imbalance and reckless environmental disregard. A striking feature of this ecological crisis, both locally and globally, is the overwhelming concentration of wealth held by the ruling elite and their agents of capital. This environ- mental malaise is characterized by the staggering loss of livelihood among working people everywhere; gross inequalities in educational opportunities; an absence of health care for millions; an unprecedented number of people living behind bars; and trillions spent on fabricated wars fundamentally tied to the control and domination of the planet's resources. The Western ethos of mastery and supremacy over nature has accompa- nied, to our detriment, the unrelenting expansion of capitalism and its unparalleled domination over all aspects of human life. This hegemonic worldview has been unmercifully imparted through a host of public policies and practices that conveniently gloss over gross inequalities as commonsensi- cal necessities for democracy to bloom. As a consequence, the liberal democ- ratic rhetoric of "we are all created equal" hardly begins to touch the international pervasiveness of racism, patriarchy, technocracy, and economic piracy by the West, all which have fostered the erosion of civil rights and the unprecedented ecological exploitation of societies, creating conditions that now threaten our peril, if we do not reverse directions. Cataclysmic disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, are unfortunate testimonies to the danger of ignoring the warnings of the natural world, especially when coupled with egregious governmental neglect of impover- ished people. Equally disturbing, is the manner in which ecological crisis is vulgarly exploited by unscrupulous and ruthless capitalists who see no problem with turning a profit off the backs of ailing and mourning oppressed populations of every species - whether they be victims of weather disasters, catastrophic illnesses, industrial pollution, or inhumane practices of incar- ceration. Ultimately, these constitute ecological calamities that speak to the inhumanity and tyranny of material profiteering, at the expense of precious life. The arrogance and exploitation of neoliberal values of consumption dishonor the contemporary suffering of poor and marginalized populations around the globe. Neoliberalism denies or simply mocks ("Drill baby drill!") the interrelationship and delicate balance that exists between all living beings, including the body earth. In its stead, values of individualism, competition, privatization, and the "free market" systematically debase the ancient ecological knowledge of indigenous populations, who have, implicitly or</page><page sequence="4">xii Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, and Planetary Crisis explicitly, rejected the fabricated ethos of "progress and democracy" propa- gated by the West. In its consuming frenzy to gobble up the natural resources of the planet for its own hyperbolic quest for material domination, the exploitative nature of capitalism and its burgeoning technocracy has danger- ously deepened the structures of social exclusion, through the destruction of the very biodiversity that has been key to our global survival for millennia. Kahn insists that this devastation of all species and the planet must be fully recognized and soberly critiqued. But he does not stop there. Alongside, he rightly argues for political principles of engagement for the construction of a critical ecopedagogy and ecoliteracy that is founded on economic redistri- bution, cultural and linguistic democracy, indigenous sovereignty, universal human rights, and a fundamental respect for all life. As such, Kahn seeks to bring us all back to a formidable relationship with the earth, one that is unquestionably rooted in an integral order of knowledge, imbued with physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual wisdom. Within the context of such an ecologically grounded epistemology, Kahn uncompromisingly argues that our organic relationship with the earth is also intimately tied to our struggles for cultural self-determination, environmental sustainability, social and material justice, and global peace. Through a carefully framed analysis of past disasters and current ecological crisis, Kahn issues an urgent call for a critical ecopedagogy that makes central explicit articulations of the ways in which societies construct ideological, political, and cultural systems, based on social structures and practices that can serve to promote ecological sustainability and biodiversity or, conversely, lead us down a disastrous path of unsustainability and extinction. In making his case, Kahn provides a grounded examination of the manner in which consuming capitalism manifests its repressive force throughout the globe, disrupting the very ecological order of knowledge essential to the planet's sustainability. He offers an understanding of critical ecopedagogy and ecoliteracy that inherently critiques the history of Western civilization and the anthropomorphic assumptions that sustain patriarchy and the subjugation of all subordinated living beings - assumptions that continue to inform traditional education discourses around the world. Kahn incisively demonstrates how a theory of multiple technoliteracies can be used to effectively critique the ecological corruption and destruction behind mainstream uses of technology and the media in the interest of the neoliberal marketplace. As such, his work points to the manner in which the sustainabil- ity rhetoric of mainstream environmentalism actually camouflages wretched</page><page sequence="5">Preface xiii neoliberal policies and practices that left unchecked hasten the annihilation of the globe's ecosystem. True to its promise, the book cautions that any anti-hegemonic resistance movement that claims social justice, universal human rights, or global peace must contend forthrightly with the deteriorating ecological crisis at hand, as well as consider possible strategies and relationships that rupture the status quo and transform environmental conditions that threaten disaster. A failure to integrate ecological sustainability at the core of our political and pedagogi- cal struggles for liberation, Kahn argues, is to blindly and misguidedly adhere to an anthropocentric worldview in which emancipatory dreams are deemed solely about human interests, without attention either to the health of the planet or to the well-being of all species with whom we walk the earth. Important to the contributions of this volume is the manner in which Kahn retains the criticality of the revolutionary project in his efforts to dialectically engage the theories of Paulo Freire and Ivan Illich, in ways that significantly pushes Freire's work toward a more ecologically centered understanding of human liberation and that demonstrates Illich's continued relevance on these matters. Key to his argument is the recognition of plane- tary sustainability as a vital and necessary critical pedagogical concern. In a thoughtful and effective manner (which has been long coming), Kahn counters spurious criticisms railed against the integrity of critical pedagogy and its proponents. Instead, he highlights both the radical underpinnings of critical theoretical principles and the historicity of its evolution - acknowledging both its significant contributions to the field, as well as its shortcomings in past articulations. Rather than simply echo denouncements of "beyond critical pedagogy," Kahn intricately weaves possibilities drawn from Freire and Illich, neither essentializing the work of these theorists nor ignoring the problematic instances of their formulations. This discussion brings a mature and refreshing sense of both political grace and sober critique, which supports the passion of our pedagogical traditions, while simultaneously chastising our slowness in taking up the mantle of ecological responsibility. Through the reformulation of Herbert Marcuse 's contributions to critical theories of society, Kahn gives voice to a North American ecopedagogy that thoughtfully seizes the power of radical environmental activists, while simultaneously opposing and calling for the remaking of capitalist ecological practices, as a key component to any critical pedagogical project. By so doing, critical pedagogy is forcefully challenged to step up to the demands</page><page sequence="6">xiv Critical Pedagogy, Eco literacy, and Planetary Crisis and needs of a world in ecological crisis, in the hopes of transforming itself into a counter-hegemonic resistance movement imbued with ecological consciousness, respect for beauty in all life, and a serious commitment to preserving the multifarious nature of our humanity. In the process, Kahn propels us beyond the debilitating theoretical posturing of the left in ways that liberate our political sensibilities and guide us toward alternative pedagogies of knowledge construction and new technopolitics of education necessary for our future sustainability. Similar to revolutionary ecologists before him, Kahn urges for a critical shift in our worldview from one that is dominated by the instrumentalization of ethnocentrism, xenophobia, militarism, and the fetishizing of all living functions, to one that acknowledges unapologetically and wholeheartedly the deep intimacy and organic connection at work in all forms of existence. In the spirit of Vandana Shiva's "earth democracy," Kahn also argues for a ecopedagogy that demands we "remove our blinders, imagine and create other possibilities," reminding us that "Liberation in our genocidal times, is, first and foremost, the freedom to stay alive."1 True to this dictum, Kahn unambiguously demands that the survival of the planet (and ourselves!) underscore our political and pedagogical decisions, despite the fact that seldom have questions of ecological concern been made central to the everyday lives of teachers and students or to the larger context of movement work, save for the liberal agenda of the Sierra Club or the well- meaning discourse on population control for poor and racialized women, espoused by people of all ideological stripes. Perhaps, it is this "missing link" in the curriculum of both public schools and political movements that is most responsible for the historically uncritical and listless response to the global suffering of human beings subjected to imperial regimes of genocide, slavery, and colonialism. In truth, a deeper analysis exposes sharply a legacy that persists today in the shrouded values and attitudes of educators from the dominant class and culture who expect that all oppressed populations and living species should acquiesce to the dominion and hegemonic rule of the wealthy elite. It is precisely such a worldview of domination that perpetuates the extinction of whole species, as it does the cultural and linguistic destruction of peoples and nations outside of a "first-world" classification. As a conse- quence, our biodiversity is slipping away, despite scientific findings that clearly warn of the loss of hardiness and vitality to human life, as a direct consequence of the homogenization of our differences. It is equally ironic to</page><page sequence="7">Preface xv note here how repression of the body itself is manifested within the capitalist fervor to commodify or colonize all forms of vital existence. Schools, unfor- tunately, are one of the most complicit institutions in the exercise of such ecological repression, generally carried out through the immobilization of the body and the subordination of our emotional nature, our sexual energies, and spiritual capacities. In response, Kahn eloquently argues for a critical ecopedagogy and ecoliteracy that supports teachers in engaging substantively students' integral natures, in an effort to forge an emancipatory learning environment where all can thrive amid everyday concerns. As such, he makes clear that, although important, it is not enough to rely solely on abstract cognitive processes, where only the analysis of words and texts are privileged in the construction of knowledge. Such an educational process of estrangement functions to alienate and isolate students from the natural world around them, from themselves, and one another. This, unwittingly, serves to reinforce an anthropocentric reading of the world, which denies and disregards the wisdom and knowledge outside Western formulations. In contrast, an eco- pedagogy that sustains life and creativity is firmly grounded in a material and social understanding of our interconnected organic existence, as a starting place for classroom practice and political strategies for reinventing the world. Also significant to Kahn's notion of ecopedagogy is an engagement with the emancipatory insights and cultural knowledge of indigenous populations, given that the majority of the social and political problems facing us today are fundamentally rooted in mainstream social relations and material conditions that fuel authoritarianism, fragmentation, alienation, violence, and greed. Such anti-ecological dynamics are predicated on an ahistorical and uncritical view of life that enables the powerful to abdicate their collec- tive responsibility to democratic ideals, while superimposing a technocratic and instrumental rationality that commodifies and objectifies all existence. Such a practice of education serves to warp or marginalize diverse indige- nous knowledge and practices, by privileging repetitive and unimaginative curricula and fetishized methods. Anchored upon such a perspective of schooling, classroom curriculum socializes students into full-blown identities as entitled consuming masters and exploiters of the earth, rather than collective caretakers of the planet. In contrast, Kahn explores the inherent possibilities at work within indigenous knowledge and traditions, in ways that enhance our capacity to not only critique conditions of ecological crisis, but to consider ways in which</page><page sequence="8">xvi Critical Pedagogy, Eco literacy, and Planetary Crisis non-Western societies and peoples have enacted ecologically sustaining practices within the everyday lives of their communities. He turns the false dominion of the West on its head, offering alternative ways of being that hold possibilities for the reconstruction of institutional culture, the transformation of how we view technology and science, and thus the reformulation of public policy. As critical educators and revolutionary activists across communities of difference, we are encouraged to turn to the wisdom of our own historical survival, in serious and sustained ways, in order to work toward the aban- donment of colonizing values and practices that for centuries have denigrated our cultural ways and attempted to disable our life-sustaining capacities. Moreover, to contend effectively with issues of racism, sexism, homo- phobia, disablism, and other forms of inequalities, a life-affirming ecological praxis is paramount. That is, one that encompasses a refusal to adhere to political, economic, and philosophical disconnections, which falsely separate humankind from those ecological dynamics that shape local, global, regional, rural, and urban landscapes. Instead, static views of humanity and the planet, which inadvertently serve the commodifying interests of capital and its penchant to divide and conquer, are challenged and dismantled through an integral political solidarity of heart, mind, body, and spirit. Accordingly, a critical ecopedagogy must then encompass those philosophical principles that are at home with ambiguity, dissonance, difference, and heterogeneity, as an ever-present phenomenon. Such an ethos supports a world where cross- species concerns are both commonplace and valued for their creative potential in the making of a truly democratic, just, and peaceful world. At the heart of Kahn's project is the intention to move us beyond a capitalist orthodoxy of consumerism, careerism, and corporate profiteering. As educators, we are invited to commit ourselves to a critical ecopedagogy that courageously embraces a new paradigm for the living out of a transfor- mative ecological praxis - one that is shaped by the power of human emo- tions, the cultural rituals of diverse ways of being, a deep respect for universal rights, and the integration of planetary consciousness. More importantly, he points us toward re-envisioning ourselves as activists, committed to ending oppression in all its manifestations, through embracing with revolutionary love and grace the significance and necessity of all life forms. The late Murray Bookchin, in The Ecology of Freedom , proclaimed that "Humanity has passed through a long history of one-sidedness and of a social condition that has always contained the potential of destruction, despite its creative achievements in technology. The great project of our time must be</page><page sequence="9">Preface xvii to open the other eye: to see all-sidedly and wholly, to heal and transcend the cleavage between humanity and nature that came with early wisdom."2 True to these words, Kahn urges us "to open our other eye" and be mindful of the delicate balance of the earth and our collective accountability to future generations. Written with analytical prowess, uncompromising courage, and political fortitude, Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, and Planetary Crisis : The Ecopedagogy Movement draws upon the passion of revolutionary visions and ancient indigenous sensibilities to awaken us to our responsibility and unequivocal commitment to the sustainability of all life. Through the perseverance of his own political and pedagogical reflections, Richard Kahn invites us to discover the beauty of a steadfast ecology of life - one that might help to release us from the bondage of our inhumanities. When we've totally surrendered to that beauty . We'll become a mighty kindness. - Rumi Professor Antonia Darder Distinguished Professor of Education University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign NOTES 1.
