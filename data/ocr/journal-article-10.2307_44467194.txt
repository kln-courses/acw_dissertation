Viano GM Research Laboratories Biomedical Science Dept. ABSTRACT Various surrogates and responses are available for study of the impact performance of energy absorbing steering systems in the laboratory. The relative influence of the SAE J-944 body block, the Part 572 dummy, and the GM Hybrid III dummy and of the associated thoracic responses were investigated for steering assembly impact in a series of sled tests. Not only did response amplitudes dif- fer among the surrogates but more importantly trends in impact performance associated with modifications of the steering assembly depended on the choice of surrogate and response. The Hybrid III dummy was judged the best of the tested surrogates for study of the steering system impact performance in the laboratory, based on its more humanlike construction, impact response and expanded measurement capacity. PREVIOUS STUDIES [1,2]* HAVE SHOWN that the driver interacts with the steering assembly over a wide range of loading conditions and configurations, and that the characteristics of the driver interaction with the steering assembly and the response of a compressible column steering assembly strongly depend on the loading conditions. Obviously the design of the wheel and compressible column are important factors. However even for a par- ticular wheel and axial compression column assembly, neither column compressive force nor steering wheel deformation force are uniquely defined. They depend on the loading conditions. Forces required to compress an axial compression column depend on impact velocity due to the influence of the steering assembly mass accelerated by compressing the column. The force also depends on the geo- metric relationship of the alignment of the * Numbers in brackets designate references at end of paper. impact force with the axis of column compres- sion - the column acts to limit the compo- nent of force aligned with the axis of column compression. Deformation force of the wheel depends on the occupant load distribution on the wheel, being relatively high for a well distributed loading but much lower when the loading is concentrated on a portion of the rim, such as occurs in off-axis loading situations. Because of the range of defor- mation forces for both the wheel and column, either or both the wheel and the column can be the primary force limiting and energy absorbing component, dependent on the occu- pant loading conditions. The range of occupant loading conditions should be considered for laboratory evalua- tion of energy absorbing steering system performance. Not only are test environment parameters important but the selection of a test surrogate and response criteria might also be important in making decisions on the influence of steering system design parameters. Various mechanical surrogates are avail- able for laboratory study of energy absorbing steering systems, representing different sized occupants or for the same sized occu- pant having different construction, response and instrumentation capabilities. Excluding other sized dummies such as 5th or 95th per- centile, General Motors currently uses three test devices to test or evaluate steering system impact response: (1) the SAE J-9^ body block (FMVSS 203); (2) the Part 572 dummy (FMVSS 208); and (3) the GM Hybrid III dummy [3]. These surrogates differ signifi- cantly from each other, representing in part a progression of the state-of-the-art in frontal impact testing devices. Various test responses provide an engineering analysis of system performance. These responses include those incorporated in the surrogate, those of the steering system and those of the interaction between the sur- rogate and steering assembly (such as force 6.846 0096-736X/ 85/ 9306-0846$02 • 50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">and loaded area). Several response limits are specified in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Other surrogate responses have been recommended in the literature to provide measures of human tolerance which the engi- neer can use to evaluate the loadings within and among various body segments. As an integral part of our study of basic principles of occupant interaction with energy absorbing steering systems [1,2], we conducted a parameter study to determine if the choice of surrogate or test response could influence laboratory evaluation of the performance of energy absorbing steering sys- tems. Similar Hyge sled tests were conducted for the SAE J-944 body block, the Part 572 dummy and the Hybrid III dummy. A two-level variation of column mass and steering wheel load distribution at two sled velocities was made for each surrogate to compare not only peak responses among the surrogates but also, importantly, the relative sensitivity of the various surrogates and responses to varia- tions in the column mass and steering wheel interface. All of our tests involved a direct thoracic impact of the steering sys- tem. Thoracic interaction of the test surro- gates with the steering system was assessed by several surrogate thoracic responses. The Fig. 1 Test fixture (loose belt around lap is to assure retaining dummy on sled and did not restrain dummy during interaction with the steering assembly) . steering assembly was instrumented to deter- mine if the choice of surrogate influenced the compression response of the steering assembly. METHODOLOGY Surrogate impacts of a steering wheel, ball-sleeve EA steering column, and shear capsule assembly were conducted in a series of Hyge sled tests. The test fixture shown in Fig. 1 provided a controlled and repeat- able trajectory of the surrogate into the steering assembly. The fixture consisted of a hard seat, a crushable foam knee restraint, a fixed foot rest and a rigid mounting frame- work for the steering column, the column angle being 20° from horizontal. The initial seated position of the surrogate, and the wheel height were selected for a centered impact of the thorax with the steering wheel. The upper rim of the steering wheel passed under the dummy's chin. The knee restraint was positioned to restrain the lower body at the time of thoracic contact with the steer- ing wheel (not a factor for the body block). Obviously the test did not model some impor- tant aspects of a vehicle crash environment or a vehicle. The test fixture did not have a windshield or dash to absorb part of the kinetic energy of the upper body, nor did the test structure simulate vehicle structural influences. The steering column was rigidly mounted to the fixture as shown in Fig. 2. The lower end of the column was attached to the fixture by a pin joint. A force transducer was placed between the lower end of the column and the sled fixture to measure the axial force associated with the EA element com- pression. The upper column was attached to the fixture through the shear capsule bracket. Steering assembly components were from a current compact car.

VIANO The Part 572 dummy, Hybrid III dummy and, particularly, the SAE J-944 body block are dimensionally different. We chose an initial position of each surrogate which maintained a "similar" initial thoracic alignment with the steering system. The fixture geometry was established for the Part 572 dummy; other surrogates were subjectively positioned to compensate for size and shape differences; however, the fixture geometry was not changed. The Hybrid III dummy was raised by a rigid spacer on the seat so that the chin passed over the upper wheel rim, similar to the Part 572 dummy tests. The body block is not a "seated" surrogate nor is it articu- lated. The height of the body block relative to the steering system approximated that used in FMVSS 203 steering assembly tests. The initial position of each surrogate is shown in Figs. 3-8. Two steering system parameters (column mass and steering wheel load distribution) and one test parameter (sled velocity) were varied in two levels for the test series. Two or more tests were conducted for each combination of surrogate and test parameter. This resulted in 50 sled tests for our study. The order of testing was not random but for a variety of scheduling reasons the tests were conducted in three groups: (1) all Part 572 dummy tests and the low velocity Hybrid III dummy tests; (2) the high velocity Hybrid III dummy tests; and (3) all SAE J-9^4 body block tests. A summary of test conditions is provided in Tables 1, 2 and 3. Sled velocities of 36 km/h and 26 km/h were used for these tests. The 26 km/h impact velocity is simi- lar to that for FMVSS 203 impacts; the 36 km/h velocity provided nominally full column compression in our test environment. The sled pulse was selected so that column compression would be initiated after sled acceleration was completed. The lack of a windshield tended to increase the amount of upper body energy available for column compression. Two levels of steering assembly mass (the steering assembly mass accelerated due to column compression) provided one of the steering system parameter variations. The standard test mass was one condition; a 25 percent increase by adding a steel collar, Fig. 9, provide the second level of mass. Two steering wheels provided the other steer- ing system parameter variation, Fig. 10. A standard steering wheel (380 mm diameter) provided a typical load distribution over the upper body. The second wheel was a 152 mm diameter disk that was chosen to concentrate the loading on the sternal region. Tests with the disk maintained the same steering assembly mass and hub location. A 152 mm diameter disk is similar to that used by Kroell, et al. for blunt frontal thoracic impacts of human cadaver subjects [4] and the test methodology recommended by Neathery to evaluate blunt frontal thoracic impact response [5].

VIANO Column compression, lower column reaction force, axial acceleration of the upper column and steering wheel biaxial force were recorded in each test. Column compression was continuously measured by a linear dis- placement transducer as the relative axial displacement of the column jackets. Steering wheel force was measured by a transducer located between the wheel and column, and added 1.3 kg to the standard upper column mass. The steering wheel force measurement consisted of a component aligned with the column axis and an off-axis component lying in a vertical plane through the column axis. Dynamic thoracic measurements in the Part 572 and Hybrid III dummy consisted of spinal triaxial acceleration and chest com- pression. The Part 572 dummy was modified to make the chest compression measurement since such measuring capacity is not part of the dummy specification. Although the thoracic accelerometers were in "typical" locations for each dummy, their location differed between the dummies. Since the body block does not have a simulated rib cage, no attempt was made to assess the local compres- sion of the test device. An accelerometer was located on the back of the body block in line with the point of steering hub contact. Obviously the triaxial resultant acceleration response of the dummies will be different than the single axis accelerometer response on the body block. Four responses were compared among surro- gates: the two thoracic responses of accele- ration and compression; the interaction force between the surrogate and steering assembly; and the maximum rate of column compression of the steering assembly. Column compression velocity multiplied by the accelerated steer- ing assembly mass provided a measure of momentum transferred to the column mass by the surrogate. The 3 ms amplitude of thoracic-spine resultant acceleration was chosen since it is specified for Part 572 dummy tests in FMVSS 208. Peak chest com- pression was chosen because it is referenced in the literature as a meaningful response for frontal thoracic impact [4,5,6,7,8]. Due to its specification in FMVSS 203, the 3 ms amplitude of interaction force was chosen as a measure of the load between the surrogate and steering assembly. The interaction force reported was not inertially compensated for the 3 kg mass of the wheel and transducer in order to provide similarity with the FMVSS 203 test method. RESULTS A minimum of 16 sled tests were conducted for each of the three surrogates. The test conditions and a summary of the responses are provided in Table 1 for the Hybrid III dummy, in Table 2 for the Part 572 dummy, and in Table 3 for the SAE J-944 body block. The data forms a matrix having nominally two tests for each combination of parameters. The body block tests did not have a chest compression measurement. Some of the columns used all the available compression and "bottomed" on the test fixture in the 36 km/h tests. In a few of these cases, all with the body block, peak response values occurred during column "bottoming". The responses for the body block tests listed in Table 3 do not include data from the period of time that the column was "bottomed" against the fixture for these few tests, because: (1) lower speed tests did not have "bottomed" columns nor did the tests with the Hybrid III and Part 572 dummies, (2) the lack of upper-body contact with other energy absorbing objects was pre- cluded in our tests resulting in greater column compression, and (3) the fixture pro- vided a very rigid reaction surface for the "bottomed" column resulting in high interaction forces. Obviously inclusion of the "bottoming" responses for the body block tests would make the comparison among the surrogates sensitive to the mechanics of column interaction with the sled fixture rather than the primary response during column compression and would have further increased the difference of the body block tests from tests with the other surrogates. Sequences from the high-speed movies and selected responses are shown for surrogate interactions with the steering wheel and disk (Figs. 3-8). One important difference among the surrogates is the greater steering wheel deformation caused by the body block loading. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE - Interaction force, maximum velocity of column compres- sion, thoracic resultant acceleration and maximum chest compression were analyzed for variance using the SAS General Linear Models Procedure [9]. The statistical procedure accommodates the unbalanced data set produced by the subgroups containing different numbers of observations and the body block tests not having a chest compression measurement. The underlying assumptions such as normal distri- bution of the data were not investigated. It might be significant that the tests were con- ducted as groups. The analysis of variance combined all the tests and included the factor "surrogate" along with "mass", "wheel", and "velocity". Interactive terms containing pairs of factors were included in the analysis. The coefficient of variation and p-values resulting from the analysis of variance are given in Table 4. The coefficient of varia- tion ranged from 6.2? to 7.5? depending upon the response. The factor "surrogate" was found to be as significant (low p-value) as "wheel", "mass" or "velocity". For inter- active terms containing pairs of factors, those pairs containing "surrogate" have 9 of 12 terms with a p-value less than 0.05 while those not containing "surrogate" have only 1 of 12 terms with a p-value less than 0.05. Thus the analysis of variance indicates that</page><page sequence="8">ENERGY-ABSORBING STEERING SYSTEM 6.853 Tabi« 1 Résulta of Analysis of Variance* Chest Thorax Interaction Maximum Column Compression** Acceleration Force Compression Velocity Source p-value p-value p-value p-value Dumny .0001 .0001 .0001 .0001 Wheel .0001 .689 .062 .193 Mass .0001 .0003 .0001 .0001 Velocity .0001 .0001 .0001 .0001 Dumny - Wheel .0001 .0007 .003 .0001 Dumny - Mass .0019 .571 .618 .102 Dummy - Velocity .002 .0001 .002 .020 Wheel - Mass .554 .993 .666 .792 Wheel - Velocity .141 .888 .960 .622 Mass - Velocity .334 .753 .078 .040 Coefficient of Variation 6.42 6.53 7.49 6.20 R-Square 0.984 0.970 0.878 0.973 * Using SAS general linear models procedure. •• Body block did not have a chest compression response. the change in response due to variation of "wheel", "velocity" and "mass" depends on the choice of surrogate. COMPARISON OF MEAN RESPONSE AMPLITUDES - The mean values for each parameter, surrogate and response combination are plotted in Figs. 11, 12 and 13. Each plotted point represents the mean response for all test conditions having that value of parameter and surrogate. Since the data matrix is unbal- anced, a mean value was first computed for each cell and then the mean of the cells of interest was computed. The means show large differences in response among the surrogates. This exemplifies the importance of the factor "surrogate" found in the analysis of variance. The body block caused the most "severe" surrogate interaction with the steering system based on the highest interaction force and greatest column compression velocity. The Hybrid III dummy caused the least "severe" interaction based on this criteria, even though it experienced the greatest chest compression. Incidentally, the Hybrid III also showed the lowest thoracic acceleration. Although the relatively stiff thorax of the body block and the Part 572 dummy is an important factor, differences in the method and location of thoracic acceleration mea- surement among surrogates might also be a factor. The mean response amplitudes for the parameter "mass" (Fig. 11) indicate a similar trend direction in response for each surro- gate. However the trend directions were in some cases opposite for the variations in the parameter "wheel" (Fig. 12). The choice of both surrogate and response are important in determining which of the wheels is the "best". DISCUSSION EVALUATION OF LABORATORY DATA - One method of evaluating laboratory data is to compare a response amplitude to a reference or tolerance value. Obviously in our test environment the choice of surrogate would influence the perceived effect of a partic- ular parameter variation or test condition if a response "limit" was used to assess the performance. Nearly a 2 to 1 difference in thoracic acceleration and chest compression was found between the Part 57 2 and Hybrid III dummies in our tests. This suggests that a wide range of conditions would exist where one surrogate's response could be above a given "limit" and the other below. Another method to evaluate laboratory test data is to rely on trends in response resulting from a steering system parameter variation. Instead of comparing a response to a tolerance "limit", the response can be treated as a continuous function of the mechanical severity of the interaction in terms of force, acceleration and displace- ment. In these mechanical terms, responses resulting from a parameter variation can be rated as a more or a less severe influence on the surrogate interaction, even if all res- ponses are above or below a reference ampli- tude. In this manner, the responses from several surrogates can be compared, even if large differences exist in the amplitude among surrogates. Applying a trend evaluation concept to the parameter "mass", for our study (Fig. 11), we find that all combinations of surrogate and response indicate that an increase in upper column mass increases the "mechanical severity" of the interaction in spite of structural differences among the surrogates. An increase in column mass increased the interaction force, the thorax acceleration and chest compression. In addi- tion, the tests with the increased column mass resulted in more momentum transfer to the column even though the compression velo- city decreased.

Fig. 13 Mean response amplitudes for variation of sled velocity (26 vs 36 km/H). In contrast, the parameter "wheel" (Fig. 12) resulted in dissimilar trends among surrogates and responses. On the basis of interaction force and column momentum, the mechanical severity of the interaction is increased for the body block when the disk was substituted for the steering wheel. How- ever substitution of the disk appears to have had little or no effect on the Part 572 dummy, and produced a reduced severity with the Hybrid III dummy based on force and column momentum. However on the basis of chest compression, the Part 572 and Hybrid III dummies indicate a greater sever- ity of mechanical interaction when the disk is used. The perceived influence of the parameter "wheel" is complicated by the choice of surrogate and response. As in many cases, additional information on the sur- rogate dynamics and system response provided by multiple response measurements increases understanding in the practical situation. The disk loads only the rib cage while the steering wheel distributes the load over the upper body. Thus, the relatively compliant chest of the Hybrid III dummy is more respon- sive to the "concentrated" disk loading, Fig. 12. The disk produces an increased chest compression and reduced interaction force, the thorax absorbs more of the energy. On the other hand, the body block does not have a rib cage to "soften" the interaction. The steering wheel provides the softer exposure for the body block, in part due to greater bending of the steering wheel rim than did the dummies. Obviously the interpretation of impact severity requires a "trade-off" in effects to arrive at an engi- neering decision whether the variation from steering wheel to disk is actually a more "severe" exposure. COMPARISON OF THE TESTED SURROGATES - The SAE J-944 body block, the Part 572 dummy, and the Hybrid III dummy differ from each other including construction, impact response, and available instrumentation. The following analysis compares these factors among the surrogates and on this basis judges which of the tested surrogates is most likely the best to study impact performance of EA steering systems in the laboratory. Construction - The SAE J-944 body block is a specific purpose test device for steer- ing assembly impact and is not intended to represent the complete human body. The SAE J-944 body block would be an unlikely choice to study head impact of the steering assembly for belt-restrained drivers. Figure 14 shows the construction of the body block as described in the SAE J-944 standard. The construction of the body block is the least representative of a human among the tested surrogates. The "head", "thorax", and "abdomen" are made of the same "rubber-like" material and thus likely have similar inter- face characteristics. The body block is not segmented and does not have articulations for</page><page sequence="10">ENERGY-ABSORBING STEERING SYSTEM 6.855 Fig. 14 SAE J944 Body Block construction* the neck, shoulders, or lumbar spine - nor does the body block have arms or shoulders which can load the steering wheel. The "rubber-like" material of the body block will deform locally under load but will not deform similar to the rib cage as described by Kroell for frontal loading [4]. The body block does not incorporate instrumentation and thus any assessment must be made on response measurements external to the surrogate. The Part 572 dummy is the Hybrid II dummy that was developed by General Motors in 1972 as a repeatable test device for lap/shoulder belt restraint testing [10]. The main fea- tures of the Hybrid II dummy were its good repeatability, durability and serviceability in comparison to other test dummies of that time. The main deficiencies of the Hybrid II dummy are its limited biofidelity and response measurement capabilities. While it has humanlike exterior shape, body weight and range of motion of some of its articulated joints, the impact response of its head, chest, and knees and the bending resistance *copied from the 1984 SAE Handbook by permission from Society of Automotive Engineers of its neck are not humanlike. In general, the response characteristics of these body segments are too stiff [3]. The dummy is instrumented only to measure orthogonal linear head and chest acceleration components and axial shaft loads of the simulated femurs. A chest compression transducer was installed in the Part 572 dummy for our study of the steering assembly. A chest compres- sion transducer is not specified in FMVSS 208. The Hybrid III dummy described by Foster, et al. [3] in 1977 was used for our study. This dummy is based on the ATD 502 dummy developed by General Motors under contract with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [11]. The Hybrid III dummy features a head structure with humanlike impact response characteristics for hard- surface forehead impacts, a neck structure with humanlike fore/aft bending response, a chest structure with humanlike blunt frontal impact response, a curved lumbar spine for a more humanlike automotive seating posture, and knee structures with humanlike impact response characteristics. Constant torque joints are incorporated in the knee and shoulder joints to improve repeatability and minimize the time required to set joint torques. The shoulder structure is designed to improve belt-to-shoulder interfacing which was a problem with the Hybrid II (Part 572) shoulder design [10], Transducers are incor- porated in the Hybrid III design to measure the orthogonal linear acceleration components of the head and chest; the sagittal plane reactions (axial and shear forces and bending moment) at the head/neck interface; the dis- placement of the sternum relative to the thoracic spine (chest compression) ; and the axial femoral shaft loads. Since the publication of the paper by Foster, et al. [3], the response measurement capacity of the Hybrid III dummy has been significantly increased and biofidelity improvements have been made to the ankle and knee joints [10,12]. These improvements would not be expected to influence the results of the tests we conducted. Impact Response - Of importance for steering assembly evaluation concerning the unrestrained driver is the frontal impact response of the thoracic region. Blunt frontal thoracic impacts of the SAE J-944 body block were conducted according to the test method recommended by Neathery [5]. Figure 15 provides a comparison of these responses to the recommended response envelop of Neathery. Also shown are the responses of the Part 572 and Hybrid III dummies for sim- ilar impacts as reported by Foster [3]. The SAE J-944 body block thorax is much too rigid compared with the Neathery response recommen- dations, Fig. 15. Additionally the body block is too elastic, returning more than 50? of the initial kinetic energy of the pendulum</page><page sequence="11">6.856 J. D. HORSCH AND D. C.

The Part 572 dummy is also too rigid. The Hybrid III dummy nearly achieves the recommended thoracic impact response requirement, thus likely providing more realistic interaction forces and energy management characteristics. Comparison Summary - The SAE J-944 body block, the Part 572 dummy and the Hybrid III dummy represent a progression in the state- of-the-art to simulate the human body and provide response measurements for the study of EA steering systems in the laboratory. The limited simulation of human body segments and articulations provided by the SAE J-944 body block, its very stiff and elastic thoracic response (compared to that recommended to simulate a human), and its complete lack of instrumentation limits the usefulness of the body block to study the impact performance of the steering system in the laboratory. The Part 572 dummy provides an improvement compared to the SAE J-944 body block because of its more human body shape, articulated neck, shoulders and arms, compressible chest structure, and internal thoracic instrumentation. Of the tested surrogates, we judged the Hybrid III dummy to be the best surrogate to study the steering system in the laboratory because of its improved humanlike frontal impact response characteristics and more extensive upper body instrumentation. Our analysis indicates that steering system impacts made with the Hybrid III dummy should provide surrogate and steering system responses more representative of field performance. We believe that it is important to continue to improve test surro- gate technology in order to increase our ability to evaluate occupant impact protec- tion in the laboratory. EFFECT OF SURROGATE CHARACTERISTICS ON STEERING SYSTEM ASSESSMENT - The sternal region is a major load path for steering system thoracic impact. The influence of the thoracic impact stiffness on the steering assembly response is demonstrated for the tests having the small diameter wheel (disk) which loaded only the "sternal" region of the surrogate. Figure 16 provides a comparison of the measured interaction force (3 ms amplitude) and a computed interaction force for the tests with the small diameter wheel. The computed force is the sum of a typical column EA element compressive force and an inertial force based on the accelera- tion (3 ms amplitude) of the column and wheel mass. The general agreement between the mea- sured (inertially compensated) and computed interaction force demonstrates that column acceleration is influenced by thoracic impact stiffness which directly influences the column force resisting the surrogate. The stiffer thorax results in the more severe interactions. The body block tests using the disk wheel have three times the inertial force compared to similar tests with the Hybrid III dummy. Tests with the standard steering wheel exhibited less chest compression than did tests with the disk, indicating that the standard wheel distributes a significant por- tion of the impact force on parts of the upper body other than the sternum. Thus thoracic stiffness is not the only important surrogate characteristic for steering system evaluation relating to thoracic loading. We conjecture that, depending on the alignment of the surrogate with the wheel, interaction responses are likely influenced by such factors as characteristics of the abdominal region, the presence or absence of articula- tions between body segments, and by the pre- sence or absence of arms and shoulders.</page><page sequence="12">ENERGY -ABSORBING STEERING SYSTEM 6.857 f ^-Surrogate to Wheel Force surrogati:! a(q) 1 (kN) 1 c (kN) F(k.N) 1 1 I measured a. 7kg typical l+C measured I y- Column EA Element F r rx • _1 / y- Compressive Force Hybrid III 23 1.6 2.7 4.3 4.9 F r rx • V Part 572 45 3.1 2.7 5.8 5.7 C J /Vy* Body Block 69 4.7 2.7 7.4 7.7 S L X ^ ^ j , , , v j V N ^^^-Column Acceleration measured j values , of , (a) , v and j (F) N - - - X I'm amplitudes'5 ^S"d »««««¡«&gt; compression test condition - 26 km/h - 1.0 mass - disk wheel TIME Fig. 16 Comparison of measured and computed interaction force (F) to demonstrate the influence of thoracic impact response on column acceleration (a) and thus on the steering assembly inertial force resisting column compression (I).

Influence of Test Velocity - Two levels of test velocity were used in our parameter study representing nearly a factor of two in surrogate kinetic energy. The Hybrid III dummy indicated a smaller increase of chest compression and thoracic spine acceleration than did the Part 572 dummy for increased sled velocity, Fig. 13. The influence of sled velocity on column compression and com- pression velocity were more nearly similar for the two dummies. Interpretation of our results for the variation of sled velocity should consider that the Hybrid III tests were grouped by velocity and conducted at separate times. We believe that observed trends due to variation of sled velocity are generally typical of the Hybrid III for our test environment and not the result of test reproducibility. A constant force EA device would respond with the same force but different duration as the test velocity was varied. The impact force characteristic of the steering assembly and impact configuration used in our study is the sum of a generally constant force element and an inertial force caused by acceleration of mass when compressing the column [1,2]. Our data demonstrates that thoracic impact stiffness directly influences the amplitude of column acceleration and thus the inertial force resisting column compression, Fig. 16. Among the tested surrogates, the Hybrid III dummy has the lowest thoracic impact stiff- ness, the lowest column acceleration and corresponding inertial force and thus the least deviation from a constant force response of the steering assembly. We interpret the low sensitivity of the Hybrid III dummy thoracic responses to sled velocity variation as evidence of a function- ing force limiting device with the additional occupant energy associated with higher veloc- ity being absorbed in column compression with minimal added energy being absorbed by the occupant. Gadd, et al. [13] concluded from human cadaveric subjects impacting EA steer- ing assemblies that the force of the test subject on the steering assembly was "quite consistent ... in spite of the variation selected in initial conditions," of which sled velocity was one of the initial condi- tions varied. The various sensitivities of the tested surrogates to sled velocity pro- vides another indication of the importance of surrogate human-like impact response for laboratory evaluation of energy absorbing steering systems. SUMMARY We found contradictory interpretations of the effect of steering system parameter vari- ations, depending on the choice of surrogate and on the types of responses used to rate the system performance. Responses of the three tested surrogates differed by as much as a factor of two in identical tests. Steering assembly responses of column com- pression, steering wheel deformation, and column momentum varied in identical tests with different surrogates. The trends in the severity of the interaction associated with a variation in upper column mass or steering wheel load distribution were sometimes con- tradictory among the surrogates and responses. For example, all surrogates and responses indicated greater "mechanical" severity, but different amounts, due to an increase in upper column mass. In contrast, substitution of a small diameter wheel (disk) for a standard steering wheel resulted in either a more or a less severe interaction</page><page sequence="13">6.858 j. D. HORSCH AND D. C. VIANO depending on the choice of surrogate and response. Our study demonstrates that the perceived effect of a steering system parameter varia- tion can depend on which surrogate and response is used. The use of multiple responses provided additional information for improved analysis of the test results. Although our study did not directly address which of the responses and surrogates pro- vides the most meaningful laboratory evalua- tion of the protective function of an energy- absorbing steering system, a comparison of the surrogate construction, response, and instrumentation was made. On the basis of this comparison, it is argued that the Hybrid III dummy provides the most meaningful laboratory evaluation of the protective func- tion of an energy-absorbing steering system of the surrogates tested. This is because the frontal impact response of the Hybrid III head, neck, thorax, and knee are closer to human impact response characteristics as recommended in the literature [3] than those of the Part 57 2 dummy. Additionally, the Hybrid III dummy has increased instrumenta- tion capability [10]. The results of our study lead us to conclude that the choice of surrogate and response influences laboratory evaluation of energy absorbing steering systems. The Hybrid III dummy is the most likely of the surrogates tested to provide interaction characteristics of the surrogate and steering system which are representative of field performance. In addition the use of multiple responses allows an improved analysis of the impact performance of the energy absorbing steering system.
