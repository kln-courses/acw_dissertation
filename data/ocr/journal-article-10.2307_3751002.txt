<plain_text><page sequence="1">Inconceivable? ROBERT GAY This paper is intended to dispose of an argument of Professor Anscombe's and an argument of Dr Kenny's. These deal with quite different subjects, but, as I will show, they proceed in exactly the same way. At the end of her 'Times, Beginnings and Causes',1 Anscombe argues that it is not conceivable that there be a beginning of existence without a cause. She explains that she does not mean that the supposition of a thing coming into existence uncaused involves a contradiction, but that we could not ever be in a position seriously to judge that a thing had come into existence unless we knew the cause of its coming into existence. Without knowledge of the cause, if, for example, I were watching a place, and saw the thing just appear there, we would be entitled to no more than that either it had come into existence then and there, or it had popped up from somewhere else. Of course, it could not have travelled to the place where I saw it appear, since if it had I would have been able to observe it travelling there. It would have to have arrived from elsewhere without traversing a path from there to here, simply by being first there, then here. You might call this an odd happening to suppose; but equally you might call it an odd happening for an object to spring into existence without a cause. And so it is only if we can indicate a possible cause of the coming into existence here of an object of the sort in question, and are prepared to say that it brought this object into existence, that we are in a position seriously to judge that the object came into existence here. This conclusion might interest someone with an axe to grind. For instance, he could think that, while there could be no argument a priori for there having been a beginning of time or a beginning of the history of the universe, he might be able to cook up an argument a posterior that the universe came into existence. And, if he could add to that conclusion Anscombe's conclusion that it is not conceivable that there be a beginning of existence without a cause, he would have 1 Proceedings of the British Academy 60 (1974), 267-270.

This in turn could be a part of a battery of arguments intended together to show it more probable than not that there is a God. But in fact the boot is on the other foot. The bare possibility of an argument a posteriori that the universe came into existence would refute Anscombe's argument. What one would need in order to argue a posteriori that the universe came into existence are scientific laws which one reckons to hold good at all times and in all places, and a description of the state of the universe now, such that one can conclude from them either that at such a time (so long ago) there was no physical thing, or that if one takes the history of the universe back to a certain time (so long ago) one will reach a state that according to those scientific laws is physically impossible. One could then know, with as much assurance as one had of the scientific laws and the description of the present state of things, that the universe had come into existence at some time less than that long ago.2 And so it is in principle possible to argue a posteriori that the universe came into existence at a time. I am not saying that there is a valid argument with true premises; by my 'in principle possible' I mean only that there is a valid form of argument and that the premises are such that we can know what would count as establishing them. But now, the universe is an object: we can make statements about it as well as about anything else. And it has just been shown that we can conceive of ourselves being in a position seriously to judge that the universe came into existence without that position involving knowledge of a cause of its coming into existence. There is a counter-example, and what Anscombe claims to be the case univer- sally can be so only for the most part. II In The God of the Philosophers,3 Kenny argues that the concept of God employed by certain philosophers ('scholastic theologians and rationalist philosophers') involves contradictions, and then, in the 2 Cf. R. G. Swinburne, Space and Time (London: Macmillan, 2nd edn 1981), 252-258. Swinburne seems a bit disdainful of such arguments, and certainly says that at present we do not possess an argument of this type which is valid and has true premises. 3 A. J. P. Kenny, The God of the Philosophers (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979). 248</page><page sequence="3">Discussion last chapter, goes on to discuss the possibility of a notion of God which would dispense with some of the attributes those philosophers insisted on, but which would still be recognizable as the traditional religious notion of God. He argues (at pp. 122-127) that we cannot conceive of a being that would satisfy this notion. His contention is not that the notion involves a contradiction, but that the notion will be that of a disembodied mind, and that we cannot conceive of a situation in which we could seriously judge there to be a disem- bodied mind. His argument is in two stages. First, we cannot attribute any state that would constitute the existence of a mind except where we can attribute purposes and agency. In particular, we cannot attribute beliefs, or awareness, where we cannot attribute agency also. Second, we can only attribute agency where there is a body that manifests the agency, and to which the actions involved (and the purposes, and the beliefs, that go with them) can be attributed. I do not mean to quarrel with the first stage. To the second stage I will reply that, indeed, we do need to be interpreting what happens to some thing or things in terms of the fulfilment of purposes, (and we could call that thing or things a body if we liked). But what is at issue is whether the actions involved must be attributed to some physical thing (be it that thing or things, or some other). Kenny quotes an example from Geach: Let us imagine that over a period of time a roulette wheel gives only the numbers 1 to 26, and that this sequence of numbers spells out English sentences according to the obvious code (A= 1, B=2, etc.). Let us further imagine that this goes on although the most elaborate precautions are taken against physical tampering with the wheel. All of this is clearly possible and raises no conceptual difficulties. I submit that we could then have conclu- sive evidence that the thoughts normally expressible by the English sentences in question were being originated, and strong evidence that they were originated by no living organism.... This and the like examples can show the possibility of disembodied thought; thought unconnected with any living organism.4 Kenny agrees that we would not attribute the thoughts in question to the roulette wheel. And, if the roulette wheel were the only thing that manifested the agency involved, this agency could be associated with no physical thing other than the roulette wheel, and so could P. T. Geach, God and the Soul (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969), 39. 249</page><page sequence="4">Discussion not be attributed to any physical thing: it would have, by elimina- tion, to be attributed to a non-embodied mind. But, he says, there would always be the possibility that the effects of the agency involved be seen in another thing also, and that this be a thing to which the agency could be attributed. (For that we need a notion of the same agency, where that is to be identity of token not of type. But we have such a notion. If there is an ordinary human body which manifests agency, and among the actions performed are predictions of what will happen to another object, and these predictions are fulfilled, we may be brought to say that the other object and the human body manifest one and the same agency: it is a case of telekinesis.) Every putative instance of non-embodied thought or agency will be a case of thought, or agency, manifested in connection with an object to which the thought or agency cannot be attributed, and every one will meet the reply that what happens to this object may indeed show thought or agency, but yet be produced by an embodied agent, by telekinesis. You might call this telekinesis an odd thing to suppose; but you might equally call a non-embodied mind an odd thing to suppose. We may picture thoughts leaving the place where the embodied agent is and arriving at the place where the object is without traversing the distance in between. It is a crazy picture, but it will bring out the parallel which there is between Kenny's argument and Anscombe's. To complete the parallel, we may rewrite Kenny's argument in terms of the crazy picture. It becomes: that we need to be able to say that the thoughts first appeared in no other place than here; for this we need to rule out telekinesis; and to do that we need there to be here an object to which we could attribute the thoughts, and ourselves to be willing to attribute them to it. Anscombe said only that if we were confronted with a situation there would be an alternative that we could not rule out. But Kenny says that the alternative of telekinesis is preferable. His reason is that we need a physical thing to which agency can be attributed as an 'Archimedean point from which the concept of agency can get a purchase' (p. 126). To judge by that phrase, and also by what he says in his paper 'The First Person',5 Kenny's thesis would be that we can only know that an event manifests agency if we can identify the agent. We 5 In Intention and Intentionality, C. Diamond and J. Teichman (eds) (Brighton: Harvester, 1979), 3-13. At p. 9 Kenny describes a different case which we might be inclined to take as an action even though we had not identified the agent, and says that the case described would not enable us even coherently to raise the question, 'Who was the agent?' 250</page><page sequence="5">Discussion cannot know of the existence of an action without knowing whose action it is. But this is obviously false: we can know of a burglary without knowing who did it. But we could take Kenny rather as claiming that when we know of an action, we know that it must be the action of some particular agent. The event which manifests agency is only the outward aspect of an action: there must also be an inner aspect, which will consist in the particular beliefs, desires and decisions that produced it. And now Kenny could turn from what might be seriously judged to what is incoherent. There cannot be particular conscious experi- ences, mental states, or whatnot, not attributed to a body because conscious experiences and the rest are only identified by first identifying the body to which they are attributed. But there are two independent answers to this argument. First, it is not plainly right that conscious experiences only count as particulars in virtue of the particularhood of a body. They might rather be particulars in their own right. Although I can only identify another person's experiences by first identifying the person, for me my own experiences are given as particulars. The third-person and the first-person views on the particularhood of conscious experiences cannot be reconciled. If we are to have a single view it will have to be by choosing one and rejecting the other, and it is not obvious that we should reject the first-person view. Second, even if conscious experiences can only be individuated by way of identifying something else, still this something else need not be a body to which the experiences are attributed. A place would be sufficient: it would be enough to make a set of co-conscious experiences particulars that they were the one and only set of experiences whose point of view on the world was from the north-west corner of the top of the tower of St Cross Church in Oxford. Nor need the locus by which a set of experiences is individuated be a geometrical point: it could be a small or large area. And it could be that the locus by which one set of experiences was individuated included that by which another was individuated (just as my body could include the body of another conscious being: it is not logically impossible that one of the cells in my body is itself conscious). Why should not a set of experiences be picked out as the one and only set whose locus is the entire universe? There is also a different line of thought which could support Kenny's outright denial of the possibility of non-embodied agency. It might be urged that in order to say that an event manifests agency we need to be able to say what would have to be the case for it to be the action of a particular agent (for example, that the agent should have moved his hands to lever the window open). It could be 251</page><page sequence="6">Discussion asserted to follow that we can only know that an event manifests agency if we have a definite idea of how it was brought about. With a burglary we would have an idea of the agent's modus operandi: with non-embodied agency we would have none. But this assertion should not be made by Kenny. For he is willing to allow that in the case of the roulette wheel we should know there to be an action, and, also knowing that it cannot be that of a non-embodied agent, should go out and search for the embodied agent, acting by telekinesis, whose action it is. And this involves our knowing there to be an action without any idea of the method by which it was done: we assuredly have no conception of how telekinesis might work. And Kenny seems right to allow this. First, surely we can say that an event manifests agency without having any idea of how it might have been brought about. That a happening is flagrantly the sort of thing that an agent could have reason to bring about is on its own sufficient to suggest to us that it manifests agency. Second, even if we do need to be able to recognize what would make the event be the result of the action of a particular agent, why should not this state of affairs suffice to make an event the result of an agent's action: that he thought, and his thought caused things to happen accordingly, without any intervening mechanism? But the line of thought could be reworked: we can know there to be an action without knowing how it was done; but, as Kenny says about the case of the roulette wheel, we should also know that it was not the action of a non-embodied agent. The reworked line of thought would defend this by the argument stated by the late J. L. Mackie in The Miracle of Theism.6 The only agency with which we are acquainted is our own. This appears at first glance a matter of direct fulfilment of intention (the intention that p followed immediately by its being the case that p). But when we consider it we find that it is not. (If any intention is followed immediately by a physical event, it is the intention to do one of the things that I can do at will. If any physical event follows directly upon an intention, it is an event in my brain. But I cannot bring about events in my brain at will?) And the simplicity of a hypothesis cannot be assessed in vacuo, but only by reference to what we know of the way things are. So the hypothesis of a non-embodied agent, whose intentions would be fulfilled directly, appears at first glance simple, but in fact is not. But this argument will not support what 6 J. L. Mackie, The Miracle of Theism (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982). 7 Cf. B. A. 0. Williams, Descartes: the Project of Pure Enquiry (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1978), 289-292. 252</page><page sequence="7">Discussion Kenny says: what it makes improbable is the direct fulfilment of intention, and so it counts against telekinesis by a mind which is embodied quite as much as against a non-embodied mind. And so it seems that we may set aside Kenny's outright denial of the possibility of non-embodied agency; the issue is only how we are to rule out the alternative of telekinesis by an embodied agent. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that we were impressed by Swinburne's versions of the Cosmological and Teleological Arguments,8 and so reckoned that it was reasonable to suppose there to be a personal explanation of the existence of a complex physical universe and the holding of laws of nature. We could put this by saying that the physical universe as a whole manifests agency. But we could not go on to say that there is an embodied agent whose body is the whole universe. For one point of saying of a physical body that it is my body is that the original existence and at least some persisting features of this body are not to be explained by my purposes and actions. (Rather, the possibility of my acting is explained by the existence and persisting features of my body.) If the very existence and most basic features of the physical universe are to have an explanation in the purposes of an agent, the universe cannot be said to be that agent's body. (Nor, of course, can anything within the universe be said to be the agent's body, for then the existence and features of that part of the universe could not be explained by the agent's purposes, while, ex hypothesis the existence of the whole universe and the holding of natural laws throughout it are to be explained in that way.) Kenny's argument appears to rely on the thought that if we can exclude telekinesis by an embodied agent at all, we can only do so by going to the place where he is and checking; and so could only exclude it totally by (per impossibile) searching through the entire universe. But in the situation that has been supposed, it would be established in a different way that we do not have to do with telekinesis by an agent with a body anywhere in the universe. It could be objected that we have still not excluded all telekinesis. We could still have to do with an agent with a body outside the universe. But it will be recalled that the original topic of discussion was the possibility of a notion that would still be recognizable as the traditional religious notion of God. The theistic philosopher may be able to embrace the last objection with open arms. The notion of an agent whose field of immaterial operation is the whole of this 8 R. G. Swinburne, The Existence of God (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979), Chapters 7 and 8. 253 9</page><page sequence="8">Discussion universe, but who has a body not spatially related to this universe, is perhaps a bit anthropomorphic for sophisticated palates; but it is very probably a notion of God widely in use for religious purposes. The first part of this story has a moral. It is proposed that we give attention not to whether a sentence is in itself meaningful but to whether we could be in a position seriously to judge it to be true. But the effect of doing this may be to direct attention away from the question what (if anything) would be the case if it were true. And it is what would be the case if a sentence were true that controls what would be evidence for its being true. The consequence may be that we think only of the ordinary ways of being in a position to make a judgment of a type, and not of ways which are not ordinary, and which are possible only for a peculiar judgment of the type. I cannot venture the same comment on the second part, as I cannot offer a positive way of establishing that a mind is not embodied-unless it were one's own mind, or one judged that one could trust the mind, and it told one that it was disembodied.9 Jesus College, Oxford 9 I am grateful to Dr A.
