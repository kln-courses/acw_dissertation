<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDITORIAL Advertising Research The fundamental problem of advertising research today is the absence of generically different theories that govern its pursuit. At the ontological level, it can be determined that materialistic psychology has con- trolled the development of our methodologies and ex- perimental designs in advertising and consumer behav- ior research for many decades. Any objective investi- gation of the theoretical presuppositions of association tests, the open-end questionnaire, the semantic differ- ential, the psychogalvanometer, etc., easily demon- strates this to be true. Advertising research exists as an implication be- tween some given communication theory (its entailed methodology and experimental designs) and consumer behavior. This means that advertising research cannot be done - coherently - in the absence of some the- ory which causally implies some physical conse- quence. These consequences must appear in the form of universal conditional statements, or what are known as scientific laws, and from which verifiable predic- tions are made. But, as everyone knows by this time, the scientific literature on the advertising-consumer behavior relation does not exhibit such laws. It has been said that the intellectual baggage of an era, its mythologies and its things taken for granted, are shared by most men of the period. When it comes to psychological theories of communication and con- sumer behavior this truth has never been more evident. For many decades, materialistic psychology has been the basic theoretical viewpoint offered to students in advertising and business courses - hence, to future management personnel. Yet, the fact that this view- point has led to little scientific understanding of the advertising-consumer behavior relation apparently has not suggested that perhaps other hypotheses - requir- ing different theoretical presuppositions -might be worth exploring. Most advertisers believe their customers to have minds of their own, to possess beliefs and attitudes, to exercise choices between Brand X and Brand Y, in other words, to be rational human beings. However, such a view of what it means to be a human being is openly contradictory to those views that attempt to explain the consumer's psychological disposition in terms of materialistic psychology (or, in terms of its final argument, "cerebral excitations"). The fact is there exists a serious intellectual crisis regarding the subject matter necessary for a valid explanation of the advertising-consumer behavior relation. Obviously, the problem of advertising research is much larger than what can only be indicated here; and much larger than what most advertisers would have the time, if interest, to analyze. Initially it is a scientific problem, but immediately it becomes a phil- osophical problem. What do.we really believe about the basic nature of man?, this is to say, can consumers ever be explained solely on the basis of any neuro- physiological psychology? In addressing this question objectively, it is suggested that the current state of advertising research has everything to do with what has happened to the study of the humanities since the turn of this Century. Advertisers like to think of themselves as being tough-minded, real world, practical men. Yet, in view of the past and present failures of neurophysiological psychology to yield scientific laws in advertising- consumer behavior research, it is not unreasonable to suggest that it might be more "practical" for adver- tisers to spend at least some research funds in pur- suing another type of psychology, specifically, one that assumes that consumers are human beings and not merely biological organisms. Nor is it being "tough- minded" for top management to say that consumers are human beings and possess minds of their own, while back at the shop its middle management is per- forming advertising-consumer behavior research that is literally forcing human qualities upon nonhuman phenomena (anthropomorphism). It is, in fact, the cold reality of this particular contradiction that debilitates more rigorous efforts for achieving better solutions to the problems of advertising and consumer behavior research. As long as the advertiser believes that the ''real world" can be explained in terms of anthropo- morphism, valid scientific research on the advertising- consumer behavior relation is not likely to receive much encouragement anywhere. Top management does not need to know how to do the complex psychological-consumer behavior re- search. This is the function of its middle management or its advertising agency. However, top management should understand enough about a given test instru- ment to be able to ask its middle management or its advertising agency intelligent questions regarding the assumptions underlying that test instrument. For exam- ple, in attitude studies, has the term "attitude" even been defined?, and if so, has it been equivocated to physical phenomena? In believability studies, if we have failed to define the term "belief," how will we know when we have identified a given "belief"? And, if we have equivocated "belief" to physical phenomena within our experimental design, then we are employing a materialistic psychology to explain nonmaterialistic phenomena. What is the generic nature of a percep- tion? Coherently specify the psychological antecedents of a person who has been "persuaded." In advertising that is based on "emotional appeals," what is the generic nature of the "emotional" element in such appeals? The above are the kind of questions that should be asked in our search for a better theory of advertising. 49</page><page sequence="2">Addressing them openly and without prejudice will become even more important, and perhaps critical, as the consumerism movement - with all its legal impli- cations - gains momentum. Up to now, poor adver- tising theory primarily has had is consequences in monies lost to advertisers by a lack of scientific knowl- edge regarding the communication process. With con- sumerism, however, this same lack of scientific knowl- edge might well be exploited by those whose main interests inevitably lead to greater government inter- vention in the free market system. Therefore, if top management really wants to be tough-minded, real world, and practical about adver- tising research, then it might show some concrete evi- dence of this by insisting on coherent analyses of our present experimental designs. What are the basic (ontological) presuppositions of association tests?, the open-end questionnaire?, the semantic differential?, the psychogalvanometer?, the depth interview?, etc. Such analyses might suggest-as a practical matter -that a generically different psychology might be worth exploration; one that, in fact, assumes the con- sumer to possess a mind - a mind that has not been redefined in terms of neurophysiological phenomena. Nothing will change at the operational level of advertising research until there is first a basic (onto- logical) change at the theoretical level. Such changes begin with coherent definitions (hypotheses) of the psychological phenomena we purport to investigate. These definitions must be valid for consumers who are assumed to be human beings - as possessing minds of their own. Our methodologies and experi- mental designs must then be true to these definitions. Definitions or test instruments which equivocate a consumer's attitudes and beliefs into physical phe- nomena necessarily subvert the whole research enter- prise. If true knowledge is desired in advertising re- search, then there is nothing more practical than a good scientific theory. If what we have been using for the last several decades has not produced causality relations involving specific ads and commercials, then the situation would seem to suggest that a different approach should at least be explored. In this regard, we need to encourage a genuine competition of ideas at the theoretical level in advertising research. Dan Stewart CONTENTS OF NEXT ISSUE [1974, 3(2)] I.
