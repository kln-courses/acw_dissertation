<plain_text><page sequence="1">V.-THE IDEA OF TOTALITY. BAl SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. I SHOULD like to say at the outset, that this paper was written and its title announced, before our President's admirable Address was delivered, or the subject of it made known. Important agreemenits between that Address and the present paper, agreements which I for one recognise with pleasure, will, I hope, become as plainly appareint to my hearers, as, doubtless, the important disagreements will be, to which the difference of our respective methods gives rise. Philosophy at the present day, notwithstanding its antiquity, has no unity, and therefore no definite status in the intellectual world; we have, instead, a bundle of attempts at philosophising. It is the affiniity of the various subject- matters which it treats, the various questions to which it seeks answers, that gives it whatever ninity it possesses. At what- ever point, and in whatever subject-matter, positive science reaches the end of its tether, and neither seeks to go, nor indeed can go farther, but ends with a question, there and at that point philosophy beoins.' There are, or at any rate may be, as rnany philosophies as there are positive sciences incom- plete in the sense that their own ultimate bases, their own postulates and axioms, are unaccounted for and unexplained. What is the remedy, if any, for the resulting disunion of philosophy, a disunion preventing its organisation as a single pursuit ? In my opinion, philosophy will attain, but will only then attain, its 'special, characteristic, and uniiversally recogrnised place and function among all the pursuits which together compose the initellectual world, when its votaries, however widely they may differ upon minor matters, and whatever</page><page sequence="2">96 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. department of it may be their particular care, shall have perceived and agreed uponl the necessity of the three following points:-First, that its purpose is to understand so far as possible the Universe in which as men we find or seem to find ourselves; Second, that for this purpose it examines the subjective aspect of the Universe, that is to say, examines our consciousness, our awareness, or the knowled(ge we have of it; and Third, that it begins by simply analysing that conscious- ness, awareness, or knowledge, not only withouit making, but also by being careful to exclude, assumptions which are not warranted by the analysis itself. Briefly stated, philosophy is that study which is based on the analysis of experience in its totality, without assuimptions, and taken strictly as experience, that is, as awareness, or knowledge of the objects which we seem to be aware of. This contention you may say is merely an individual's private opinlion and speculation. Well, I amn quite conitent that it should be so taken. Indeed, I see that it must be so taken until it is accepted. Till then, there are as many philosophies as there are philosophers; or rather as many as there are fundamental and unwarranted assumptions made by enquirers of different temperaments aiid dispositions. For the three points stated are no philosophy of minie; they are no philosophy at all; they are simply the prelimlinary of any organised philosophy, adopting provisionallv commion-sense ideas and terms for its expression; a prelimninary of philosophy necessary, indeed, to its successful cultivation, and justified as necessary by the history and development of the various divergeilt philosophies, and particular departmaents of philo- sophical thought, wherever such have existed, down to the present day, but not imposing any restriction, or prescribiilg any foregone conclusion, implicit or explicit, upon the experience anialysed, but on the contrary guarding against such foregone conclusions in endeavourin, to exclude all initial and unwarranted assumptions, and leaving conclusions to be</page><page sequence="3">THE IDEA OF TOTALITY. 97 reached, if reached at all, by the consensus of the analyses instituted by indepenident enquirers, each into his own care- fully scrutinised experience. And this philosophical consensus is specially difficult to attain, far inore difficult than a consensus in any positive science, because it must be ultimately based on what is imimediate in the consciousness of individuals, while at the same time the immediacy of an individual's consciousness is something lnot shared by, or communicable to, any other individual, nor capable of making part of the immediacy of any other individual's consciousness. An in-dividual's con- sciousness is imm-lediately objective to itself, consciousness beina a self-objectifying process, objectifying its own contents. But anl individual's consciousness and all its parts, that is, all its immediate contents or objects, are only medliately known or knowable by other individuals; that is to say, as objects of their consciousness they are only mediately known. No state of consciousness is imnmediately known in more than one consciousness. When, for instance, the sun shlines out frol behind a cloud, I lhave the visual sensation of light, an immediate experience; but this, my immediate experience, is only a mediate object of your experience, supposing you to be standing by, just as your immediate experience of the same light is but a miediate object of mine. The two sensa- tions, yours and mine, in their immsediacy are incommiiuni- cable; neither of us can experience both, still less can either of us compare them as immediate experiences. It is only by relatingc our ideas of themi to our ideas of other objects that either of us can think of our imimediate sensations as the same in kind. Now sinice all our philosophical knowledge must be based upon imnmediately known experienlces; siince imnmediate experiences are our only ultinlate evidence for anything what- ever, including our belief in ourselves as individual Subjects of the experiences, as well as our belief in common real G</page><page sequence="4">98 SHADWORTH: H. HODGSON. Objects of them (such as the sun and its light in the above instance), the truth of all mediate knowledge being inferential, depending for its proof solely upon self-evident, that is, inmmediately evident data; it follows that a consensus of individuals, in analysing each his own immediate, unshared, and in its immnediacy incommunicable experience, miust be something exceptionally difficult of attainment. And this is just what we find to be the case. But here a few more words are requisite in elucidation. The very term immnediacy is ambiguous. It means one thilln in application to consciousness as a Knowing, and quite another thing in application to consciousness (that same consciousness) as an Existent. And this latter distinction itself is one not usually drawn or attended to; irndeed, I doubt whether it is drawn explicitly anid as a fundamental distinction in all experience, by anyone but myself; anid it is certainly one niot easy to keep in view, even when it has once been clearly drawn anid its necessity perceived. Immediacy in application to consciousness as a Knowing means the self-evidelnce of any sinale empirical presentatioin (e.g., a visual sensation) including its insepaiable elements, if any, and is opposed to the mediate character of more complex contents of consciousness, for the unioii of the several comnponents of which inito a single content some mediating fact or reason is required (e.g., the perception of what we call a material solid object). Immediacy here expresses the self-objectifying character of consciousness. But the same term, immigediacy, in application to consciousness as an Existenit, means that incoMmunicable vivacity or awcta-ness whichl is the essenitial characteristic of coinsciousness itself, wvatever its contents as a Kniowing may be, and expresses the fact that there is no mediumii required between conisciousness and its proximate real condition. or what is commonly called its Subject, whatever nmay be the nature of that Subject or Real Condition. It is ani immediacy which needs no further link to biild together consciousness aind its proximate real</page><page sequence="5">THE IDEA OF TOTALITY. 99 condition into one single or individual Conscious Being. A conscious being consists of consciousness annd its proximate real condition in intimate union. It is plain, I think, that these two senses of the term immediacy in consciousness (as a knowing and as an existent) are very different, that the presence of the one kind of imme- diacy by no means implies the presence of the other. Mediate as well as immediate contents or objects of consciousness as a klnowing may be actual presentations in the existent conscious- ness of an individual conscious being, and in that sense be incommiunicable to any other individual. And aaain, contents or objects of consciousness as a knowing, once distinguished and named either as immediate or mediate contents of an individual's experience, miiay be dropped out of view, detached as it were from the actual current of hiis existent consciousness, and lose thereby that immediacy in the second sense, that incommunicable vivacity, which is the characteristic of con- sciousness as an existent. They thus and in that state become representations or ideas, capable of recall by memory into the streain of an individual's consciousness as an existent, the precise meaning of this recall being the evocation of their exact, or apparently exact, similars in point of kind, with per- ception at once of the similarity and of the numerical difference due to the difference of the timiies of their occurrence in the stream of his existent consciousness. And the immediate presentation or presentative awareness which the individual then has of thenm, as representations or ideas, gives hili the means of verifying or correcting, themi, that is, of ascertaining by further anialysis their true nature as cognitions, and their agreement or disagreement as cognitions with one another. Yet, different as the two kinds of irnmediacy are, the presence of both is requisite in those experiences which, if anything,- are to be the foundation of philosophy; and this would be the case even if philosophy were confined to a single individual, and no consensus of individuals were sought for or G 2</page><page sequence="6">100 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. suggested as included in its purpose. It is because the experielnce of an individual gives him undeniable evidence of the existence of other individuals similar to himself, that he seeks to estab- lish a consensus between his own views and theirs regarding that universe which his own experience also tells him is the common object of them all. This consensus he seeks to estab- lish by comparing the ideas or representations which he has of the contents, whether mediate or immediate, of his own con- sciousness as a knowing, with the ideas or representations which other individuals have of the contents, whether mediate or immediate, each of his own consciousness as a knowing. Aind the means for this comparison consist, primarily and chiefly, in speech or diag,ram, which are objects or actions simulta- neously perceived or perceivable by the several individuals concerned, as objects comm-on to all, or as actions passinig letween them, and which express and recall, by association, for each individual, the ideas or representations to which in his own experience he has attached theni. It is thus those ideas or representationis spoken of in the preceding paragraph as detached or detachable from the current of an individual's con- sciousness as an existent, but also as capable of recall into it by memory, that become the common object-matter of discus- sion and controversy in philosophy. And these it is which each individual has to bring over and over again into the immediacy of his own presentative existent consciousness, and therein to test or correct by repeated analysis, while at the same time he endeavours so to distinguish, analyse, and describe them, as to lead other individuals to distinguish, analyse, and describe them as he does, by bringing them into the steady light of their own piesentative consciousness. The seeking for a conisensus is ino peculiar characteristic of philosophy; it is part and parcel of our inherited nature as human beings. And the means for establishinig it are essentially the same in all cases. The mother teaching, and the child seated on her knee and learning, to speak articulately, to attach</page><page sequence="7">THE IDEA OF TOTALITY. 101 names to thingrs, to connect written letters with vocal sounds, and so on, are instances of the establishing of a consensus between them. Common objects, simultaneously perceived as common to both parties, are the only mieans whereby in any case the consensus can be effected. The difference in the case of establishing a consensus in philosophy is, that here the agreement sought for is an agreement between the ideas, analyses of ideas, perceived or inferred relations of the com- ponents of ideas, which make part of the experience of one individual on the one hand, and on the other hand the ideas, analyses, components, and relations, which make part of the experience of other individuals, while there is no idea or com- ponent of an idea, or relation between either, perceived as common by all individuals, and admitted by all to begin with, which can serve as the criterion of the sameness or difference, in kind, of the remaining ideas, components, or relations of ideas with each other. For here the objects of sensation, perceived in common and simultaneously, which served as the means, and therefore as the criteria of a consensus in pre- philosophic thinking, make default; inasmuch as the true nature of those objects is knowable only by means of the ideas we form of them, while these ideas are among the very objects concerning the sameness or difference of which, in different individuals, a consensus is sought by philosophy. Now, as objects belonging to the immediate presentative consciousness of each individual as an existent consciousness, ideas in their immediacy are just as incommunicable as sensa- tions are. And the difference between arriving at a consensus in philosophy and arriving at a consensus in pre-philosophic thinking is just this, that in the former there is no comnmonly admitted object behind the ideas, or which, as ideas or com- ponents or relations of ideas, they are admitted to represent, as there is in the case of some sensations at any rate; but the ideas themselves and their contents raise this very questioln,- whether there is any such object, and if any, of what sort it is,</page><page sequence="8">102 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. or what idea or thought we are justified in entertainina con- cerning it. II. In fact the question, what the idea of Totality means when applied to the Universe, or in what sense it is implied in the idea of the Universe itself, which is that which gives it importance as a philosophical question, is thus opened. I may seem to have been somewhat long in coming to the direct discussion of the proposed topic; but I think that, without sonme such analytical remarks as the foregoing, the true place and function of the idea of totality in philosophy could hardly be appreciated. In these remarks I have, of course, gone beyond what I called at the outset the preliminary of philosophy, and have entered by analysis upon the domain of philosophy itself. The confusion which results from failing to distinguish the two senses of immediacy in consciousness results ultimately from failing to draw the ultimate analytical distinc- tion upon which the former depends; I mean the distinction between certain inseparables in the philosophical analysis of consciousness itself, namely, its content as a knowing, and the fact or process of its existence as a consciousness having that content. The usual course is to consider consciousness, undistinguished into these inseparables (which we may call its subjective and objective aspects) as the property or attribute of a Subject, and thence, and on that assumption, to proceed to enquire what and how much of the knowledge which it seems to give us of Objects is contributed by the Subject, and what and how much, if anything, is contributed by the Objects, of which it seems, to give us a knowledge. So much it is necessary to say at presenit of the contrast between these two methods of plhilosophising. But there are terms in great number current in philosophy, and I think Totality is one of them, which are ambiguous for a reason very similar to that which makes the term Immediacy ambiguous;</page><page sequence="9">THE IDEA OF TOTALITY. 103 I mean inattention to aniother philosophical distinction, though this is one far more generally admitted, and in some shape agreed on, the distinction between Percept and Concept, or more strictly between purely perceptual data and the shape which they assume in thinking or conceiving them. This is not a distinction betweeni two aspects of consciousness irre- spective of any other difference in it, that is, irrespective of what its other contents, save only this difference of aspects, may be. It is a distinction between two kinds of contents, both kinds being contents of consciousness as a knowing, one of which kinds is alleged by one school of philosophy, and the other by another school, to be necessary as a component or prior conditio cognoscendi of the other kind. Strict Experientialists, basing themselves upon analysis, maintain that purely per- ceptual data are necessary as a prior conditio cognoscendi of conceptionis; strict Idealists, basing themselves upon the assumption that thought is an agency, maintain that conceptions are necessary as a prior conditio cognoscendi of purely perceptual data. Strictly Idealism therefore stands on a basis closely similar to that upon which what I have called above the usual method of philosophising stands, of one school of which method (the Kantian) it is, as is well known, the offspring. The point in which it differs is this, that, instead of assuming a Subject, of which consciousness is the property, it assumes an Agency in one imiode of consciousness, namely Thought, which is productive of all contents thought of, including what are called purely perceptual data. The two assumptions are alike, and in my opinion alike fallacious, in this, that they both lay at the basis of philosophy an hypothesis concerning the genesis of consciousness, without distinguishing its genesis from its content, bujt nevertheless taking the hypothesis (that of an agent or an agency) as something already known; although it is only from the content of consciousniess that the evidence for any hypothesis can be drawn, whether that hypothesis be the</page><page sequence="10">104 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. hypothesis of an agent, as in assuming a Subject, or that of an agency, as in assuming Thouaht. The only true method, as strict Experientialists must miaintain, is to analyse those contents of consciousness which give us our ideas of agents in the one case, of agency in the other. For this is necessary before we can be warranted in assuming any Being or Action in which those ideas are involved, as explanatory of anything else, whether being or action, whether object, process, or event. The consequence of the assumption made by the strict Idealists is, that it compels them to treat concepts, which are shapes or forms taken by contents of consciousness in thought, as efficient causes, and therefore as explanations, at once of the nature and the genesis of the particulars to which as concepts they are applicable. And if concepts have this nature, at once explanatory and efficient, then what otlher account of the Universe can be given than this which mitust be given, namely, that it is one creative, rational, and all-inclusive Concept ? And that is the theory of strict Idealism, which follows inevitably and directly from its origiinal assumption. But then that assumption is-an assumption; not warranted by the analysis. of experience; a fine theory, but a German figmenlt; and I may add, a fine specimen of anthropomorphism. In philosophising we are of necessity thinking, and thinking by mlleans of concepts, conceiving being a necessary part of the thinking process. But this does not show that thinking produces the content as well as the logical form of its own concepts. The specific ilature or quality of a content of consciousness, as distinguished from its existernce, genesis, or occurrence in consciousness, is incapable of being accounted for by any cauise or real condition, but must be taken as aln ultimate datum of experience, iniseparable from any empirical moment or content of consciousness whatever; which is a fact I have repeatedly endeavoured to lead my readers to recognise as I do. And it is a fact which entirely upsets the notion, that logical forms can be the producers of purely perceptual data, seeing</page><page sequence="11">THE IDEA OF TOTALITY. 10io that in these data there are inseparable ingredients, namely, their specific qualities, which as such cannot be thought of as. produced by any cause or real condition whatever. In the cotitent of consciousness as a Knowing there are inseparable elements, distinguishable though inseparable from one another, which must be taken as ultimate data, niot produced but presupposed by any and every process of thinking or conceiving.. And Thought itself as an empirically known process is of necessity analysable into contents containing elements not producible by itself, or by the logical forms which belong to it as a conscious process dealing with those contents or their elements. Strict Experientialists must therefore conceive purely perceptual data not only as distiinct in kind fronm the forms which they assume in logical thought, but also as a necessary prior conditio cogiwscendi, or pre-supposition, of those logical forms. Logical thinking is in fact a conscious action ainmingr at what is commonly called understcanding, that is, bringing into more and more consistent order; data of conscious- ness which as data are purely perceptuial. So far from creating percepts, the function of thought is to understand and interpret. them. III. Now thie ambiguity in the idea of Totality, which I have spoken of above as due to inattention to the philosophical distinction between Percept and Concept, arises in the following way. The purely logical idea, or concept, of Totality implies completeness, limitation, and finitude, since thiniking proceeds only by limitation of contents of consciousness in thought. The concept of Totality is the conception of a Relationi, and the term expressing it is a relative term; a Whole is relative to the Parts included in it, and the Parts are relative to the Whole in which they are incluided. But neither the concept nor the term expressing it gives any indication as to whether there are or are not perceptual data beyond those which are included in any Whole which may at any time be conceived, that is, taken as</page><page sequence="12">106 SffADWORTH H. HODGSON. the object of a conception in which comlpleteness, limitation, and finitude are implied. Hence the ambiguity of the idea of Totality or of a Whole, namely according as we take it as admitting or as denying the possibility of perceptual data which as perceptual are incomplete, unlimited, and infinite. Conse- quently the term Whole is ambiguous, inasmuch as it has two senses, one signifiyingr infinity, the other finitude, in the object to which the terni is applied. The confusion therefore is great, which in philosophy results when we apply the idea and the termu Whole to all contents of consciousness indiscriminately, that is, without considering that there are or miiay be elemnents in the perceptual data of consciousness to which they are entirely inapplicable, if and when they are taken in the purely logical sense which imrlplies completeness, limllitation, and finitude. Now it is in the forimer senise, and not in the latter or purely logical sense, that the idea of Totality is implied in thinking of the Universe, or in speaking of the Universe as a Whole. When we try to conceive it in the strict sense of completeness implied by the purely logical conception, we fail; its per- ceptual content refuses, as it were, to be confined by any concept which implies the completeness, limitation, and finitude of its object. We cannot as a fact conceive the Uniiverse as a Whole in the latter sense, the sense required by the purely logical idea or conicept of Totality, without tlhereby coniceiving it as a finite part of the Universe thought of as a Whole in the former sense, that is, as including perceptual data which are incormiplete, unlimited, and infinite. The facts of perception, which are the pre-supposition and supply the conitent of concepts, dominate our thinking. When we try to think of themii as they are, we have of necessity to think of theni as we finid them, not as we make them by thirnking, of them; that is, we have to think of them as they are given in perception; and in all perception there are certaini elements, one of which is uiniversally present, which as given are given as exceedingr the percepts in which they ale co-elements, that</page><page sequence="13">THE IDEA OF TOTALITY. 107 is, as given elements which we find, in thinking, of them, to be in contrast with the completeness of purely logical concepts, and name, in consequence of that contrast, incomplete, un- limited, and infinite. I speak of what are called- the formal elements of perception, Time-duration and Spatial-extension. These are given as continua, into which all -difference and therefore all limitation is introduced by their co-element of sense or feeling, without destroying their own specific nature as continua. And it is the continuity of these formal elements of perceptual data which both enables and compels us to thiink of the Universe as a Whole, that is, as a single all-incluisive Object, all the parts of which are in continuity with each other, while at the same time, as a Whole, it is incomplete, unlimited, and infinite. The Universe, of which we find ourselves a finite part, is to us a Whole in virtue of its con- tinuity with our actual experience, but a Whole which no human thought can grasp, that is, conceive as complete, limited, anid finite. We have to think of it, as we perceive it, from within; that is to say, as perceived from a present moment of Time and from a central position in Space, with both of which percepts it is conitinuous, and in respect to both of which it is infinite. But besides time duration and spatial-extension, which are known as the formal elements of perceptual data, there are others, as already mentioned, equally essential to those data, and equally independent of logical thinking; I mean the specific qualities of feelina, whether of sensation or of emotion, the nature of which as specific qualities, distinguislhed from their existence, genesis, or occurrence in consciousniess, has to be taken by us, in all cases, as an ultimate datum, ail elemen-t in experience not capable of being accounted for. Now, owing to this unaccountability in the lnature of specific feelings, which nievertheless we experience as actual data, we caninot deny the possibility of the existence of specific qualities of feeling, besides those of which we, as humiani beings, have actual</page><page sequence="14">108 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. experience-qualities entirely unimaginable by us in their specific nature, and existing in numbers to which we as human beings can assign no limit. And not only in infinite time or in infinite time and space together may there be such specific qualities of feeling, alike unimaoinable and ininumerable by us, but also there may be other formal elements besides the two actually given elements, timyie-duration, and spatial-extension; for these also, as ultinmate data, have the same unaccountability as specific feelings have, so far as their specific nature or quality is concerned. And just as time-duration and spatial-extension are compatible with one another in being, both at once, formal elemeints in one and the same perceptual object, so both alike may be compatible with othier formal elements which, thouah unimaginable by us in their specific nature, may be the co-elements of specific feelings which by us are also specifically unimaginable. When we tlink of the Universe in the way which I have now endeavoured, however feebly, to depict, how infinitesimal must all our human knowledge of it appear, compared to a knowledge in which all that we have to tlink of as merely possibilities should be objects actually and positively known. By this, of course, I do not mean that certaini specific imagina- tions, which we can oinly imagine as possibilities, should be knownl positively as realities. My nmeaning is, that a world or worlds specifically unimaginable by us, but yet continuous with that world which is by us imaginable, and in virtue of that continuity making part along with our imaginable world of the same infinite Universe, should be the object of an infinite kniowledge, that is, a knowledge adequate inideed to its infinite object, but which we cani only think of as escaping, like its infinite object, all possibility of human comprehension. Of such a knowledge every individual human consciousness wouild be an inifinitesimal object, completely known and com- prehended. But no human consciousness could pretend to know, either Row such a knowledge was possible, or what were</page><page sequence="15">THE IDEA OF TOTALITY. 109 the modes of its knowing process, any more than it can pretend to know how the Universe itself is possible, or ho?w those specific natures or qualities are possible, which are the ultimate data of its owni knowledge. Both the Universe anid these ultimate data must by us be taken simply as facts, of which we can give no account. And it mnust be remem- bered, that in philosophy we are employed in the examination of our own knowledge, an d do not begin by assuming that this examination must perforce end, if the right course of enquiry is followed, in an adequate knowledge of the nature of the Universe. Once let a man be convinced that the idea of Infinity, whether of Tiine only or of Time and Space together, is involved in every attempt which he makes to give a com- plete account of anything whatever, and he will at once see the futility of supposing that he can fram-e a theory of the Uniiverse which explains its origin. He cannot represent in thought its beginning to be. Infinity precludes explanation. And Infinity is involved in the content of man's consciousness as a knowing, which is his only evidence of Being or of Existence. IV. We are thus brought back to the distinction between the two aspects of consciousness, the subjective and the objective, which was dwelt upon in the first Section of this paper. If the veil of Infinity, it may be argued, is drawn over the origin of the Universe by essential elements inseparable fronm man's knowledge of it, does not this compel, him to think of the parts, so of necessity hidden from him, as Realities which have a nature of their own entirely out of relation with his modes of consciousness? Are they not what Kant called Things-in-themselves ? Not so, the reply must be. Those hidden parts of the Universe are not thought of, nor can they be thought of, as out of relation to humiian rnodes of con- sciousness, seeing, that these latter supply the only ground for man's thinking of them at all. Kant's other term for</page><page sequence="16">110 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. them, Notmena, was far preferable, though that also was faulty, in failing to indicate their perceptual, uncausable, and therefore, to man, inexplicable nature. Man cannot but think of Being or of Existence as an Object of some conscious- ness, whether his own or another's, and consequently of Reality in all its kinds, and of Infinity, as objective features of Being and of Existence, as they would be perceived by an infinite consciousness, supposed to be adequate to their apprehensioni. It is only through the idea of perceivability that we arrive at the idea of Being. We can readily frame the idea of Realities which transcend man's powers of perceiving them; but we canlnot frame the idea of Realities which in their own nature, or a parte rei, are unperceivable. The thoug,ht of an Existent unperceivable in its own nature would contradict our sole ultimate evidence for Existence, nanmely, perceivability, and in thinking or trying to think of it as in its own nature unperceivable we should ipsofacto think it nion-existent. It is at this point in our thinking of the Universe that my distinction between consciousness as a knowing and that same consciousness as an existent seems to imie to throw light upon our thought. It saves us from the fallacy of imagining that the Universe depends for its existence upon the existence of our consciousness, while at the same time we recognise that modes of our consciousness are our only evidence either for its existence or for its nature. The evidence is one thing, the existent made evident is another. Our consciousness as a kinowing is the subjective aspect of all that we think of as existent, that is, of the Universe, including our consciousness itself. But then, as itself an existent, we have perforce to think of it as dependent uponi the totality of that Universe, of which, as an existent, it is an infinitesimal portion. Its own two aspects, as a knowing and as an existent, place it in a double relation to the Universe which it reveals; as a knowing, it is its opposite and to us its subjective aspect, its</page><page sequence="17">THE IDEA OF TOTALITY. ill evidence, or conditio cognoscendi; as an existent, it is its con- ditionate, depending for its own genesis upon its efficient agency. The Ego itself has this double relation. In the order of- knowledge, "We" are objects before we are subjects; in the order of existence " We" are subjects before we are objects. Now, if we apply this distinction of aspects, found within our own consciousness, to the Universe which is the object known or knowable by its means, and also known as con- ditioning the existence of that conisciousness which is the knowledge of it, what we find is this. The Universe taken as a knowable or known object is ipso facto distinguished from our consciousness which is a knowledg,e of it, and that in both aspects of the latter; distinguished froii its knowing aspect as its object, from its existent aspect as its producer or real condition. But the hLow, the reason, the possibility, the modus operandi, in the case of both relations, is unknown to us, and apparently undiscoverable by us. It is hiere that we are at the end of our tether,-as before in positive science, so here in philosophy,-and yet here that we nmust be conltent to acknow- ledge that these relations are facts of experience which we cannot avoid experiencing, facts, therefore, which aie evidenlce of what we are fain to call a Power in the Universe forcing the experience upon us, without imagining the idea of Power to be an explanation of either do tlhe relations. Plato's idea of Power (8vvakc9) as the characteristic of Reality or Real Being in its fullest sense (To o'zrWsI e'tat), which I quoted in my paper of- last Session-Fact, Idea, agnd Emotion* is thus justified. It is justified, as I there remarked, niot as an explanation, but as an alternative characterisation of Beingy, expressing the unavoidable natule of our experience of Being, as the Object of Consciousness. Many years ago I concluded an article devoted to questions like the present with the words "The curtain is the picture," * Proc. Arist. Soc., vol. vii, N.S., p. 133.</page><page sequence="18">112 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. alluding to a well-known classical story, and meaning that the curtain of consciousness was itself the real picture, in fronit of which it seemed to hang as a real curtain. But ever since I ventured on that Idealistic over-statement I have been unlearnina it. The truth colntained in Idealism, for some truth I think it contains, is, not that consciousness is the only real Being, but that it is ouronly evidence of real Bein, though, when it is evidence of a reality which is not-conscious- ness, it is rnediate and inferential, not immediate in the first of the two senses of immiediacy, distinguished above in Section I, that is, as applied to consciousness as a knowing. The fact that such an inference is consciousness does not militate with its own truth, namely, with the reality of its own inferred object, as something which is not-consciousness. This it is, in my opinion, which oversteps and overstates the truth in strict Idealism, namely, its denial that anything which is not-consciousness can be real. Now the content of consciousness as a Knowing furnishes the proof, that there is real Being beyond its means of positive and actual apprehension. though it canl render that idea intelli- gible, and indeed non-contradictory, only by thinking of the real and transcendent Being (transcendent, be it understood, to human modes of positively knowing, not to consciousness gene- rally) as the Object of a Conaciousness as infinite and eternal as itself. In otlher words, that which is true in the Idealistic doctrine implies the truth of Realisnm. Consciousness, gene- ralised in thought, shares the iilfiniity and eternity of Being which is its object, but Being contains, what Consciousness does not, something for which man has no other terms than such terms as Power, Agency, Efficielcy. But is not then, it may be askled, the Reality which maii indicates by such terms as power, agency, efficiency, is not this Reality, after all, a veritable Tlting-in-itself, an unknowable Reality ? By no means. It must still be thought of as an Object of consciousness generalised, of an infinite and eternal</page><page sequence="19">THE IDEA OF TOTALITY. 113 consciousness. Terms like power, agency, efficiency, are terms denoting what may, perhaps, be called the formal element in man's thinking of Objectivity, as distinguished from any positive content of that thought. They denote what is to him ultimate and inexplicable, namely, the fact that existents exist, that events occur. And as expressions for this fact they are not capable of further analysis. The knowledge or awareness that existents exist, or that events occur, can be atnalysed as a process of consciousness. Simply as a process, abstracting fronm its content, it is analysable into its two aspects, subjective and objective; and it does not exist as a process of consciousness until both aspects are contained in it; it is an objectifying process, and its least possible content is what we call an emapirical state of consciousness. But the objective aspect, taken apart from its .subjective aspect, the merefact of it, the fact of its objectivity, cannot be analysed farther. It is what we call its Being. Consciousness here conitains, human consciousness contains, what abstract Being does not, namely, a distinction within its own awareness of Being, a perception of the two opposite aspects involved alike (as we cannot but think, in consequence of this distinction) in Being and in Consciousness, in Objectivity and in Subjectivity. But we can no more say what this objective aspect, the abstract fact that existents exist, or events occur, is in itself or per se, than we can say wlhat any ultimate clemnent in knowledge, that is, what feeling, or time-duration, or space- extension, is per se. Except so far as Power and Being may be held to be equivalent or alternative terms, one of them expressing dynamically what the other expresses statically (for which see my paper, Fact, Idea, and Emotion, above referred to), we cannot give to themii, or to any of these abstractions, alternative, or in any way equivalent, and therefore so far explanatory names. They none of them exist except as inseparable aspects or elements of (philosophically speaking) concrete or empirical wholes, empirical meaning in philosophy H</page><page sequence="20">114 THE IDEA OF TOTALTY. whatever has distinguishable, though often also inseparable features. It is with concrete or empirical wholes that our experience begins; and owing to the fact, discovered by analysing experience, of the inseparability, first of its two aspects, and secondly of the elements in its simplest objects, it is with a concrete or empirical whole, in the same philosophical sense, that is, not with an abstraction, that our philosophy must end. But whether man can ever frame a positive idea of the concrete or empirical whole with which he sees that his philosophy must end, this, I think, it will now be evident, is quite another question.</page></plain_text>
