<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE OWL OF ATHENA. IN the Archaeological Seminar at Upsala is a vase, presented by Dr. Nachmanson, the design on which is illustrated in Fig. 1. I forbear to discuss it in any other respect than that of the design, as Prof. Sam Wide, to whose kindness I owe the permission to use the illustration, reserves to himself the right of dealing with the vase fully in a subsequent publication. It is an amphora of good b.-f. style to be dated about 550 B.c., and the scene is framed in a border which displays along the top the maeander IBr IB~i~BB~;i~iT~.~'-~ida sC -C~ a-=:i::::: :::;:;: :::::i;l_: :: : ::-:j:::::::--:::; :-::: :: FIu. 1.--VASE IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SEMINAR, UPSALA. pattern and at the sides a double row of dots. In the centre of the scene is an altar towards which the priest advances from the left leading the ram he is about to sacrifice. He is a youthful male figure, draped only in his himation, and crowned with a wreath of olive. Beside the altar on the r. rises a slender column surmounted by a statue, the upper part of which disappears from our ken beyond the borders of the field; evidently the statue was not of paramount importance in the scene depicted. Beyond the column to the r. the fore-part of a bull is visible: the sacrifice was of a most 174</page><page sequence="2">THE OWL OF ATHENA 175 complete kind.1 But to whom was it offered? The answer is revealed by the presence of an enormous owl, seated upon the altar, whose body in profile is turned towards the worshipper; but the head, represented full face, is turned at an impossible angle towards the spectator. In the same way on an engraved gold ring of the fifth-fourth century in the British Museum, the deity, Zeus, to whom a woman is sacrificing at an altar is FIG. 2.-ENGRAVED GOLD RING IN THE BRITISH MUSEUIM. represented by an eagle 2 (Fig. 2). Thus, as in countless votive reliefs of an early date, for example the hero reliefs from Sparta, etc., the relations between the deity and the spectator are fully established. The olive branches which straggle across the background from the r., although they doubtless serve to fill the space, are probably also intended as an indication that the scene takes place in the open air. In certain cases animal forms were introduced, not as a mere decorative motive, but from a clear desire to express a definite meaning, the significance of which would be obvious to the spectator, and hence the introduction into the picture of animals as symbolic of divinities. Dr. Rouse in his interesting work Greek Votive Oqerings gives much valuable information, but on p. 375 he says: 'The attendant animals are not treated as equivalent to their deities and are therefore not proved to be symbolic of them.' And on p. 380: 'The Greeks would not consider an attribute or an attendant animal as an equivalent for the deity himself.' To this rule, he maintains, the early artists invariably adhered until 'the great dividing line of the fourth century;' after which a change takes place and in the succeeding centuries many innovations were introduced, and with the gradual weakening of the early simplicity and directness of faith, religion in general was overlaid with elaborate and fantastical symbolism. In many cases the explanation which Dr. Rouse gives of seeming contradictions to this proposition are perfectly logical, but there seem to be certain instances where the statement might be qualified, as the vase under discussion proves. He has observed that in certain cases, as for example on coins," the representation of the owl is really a sort of short- hand mark for the city of Athens. In the vase under discussion, however, the owl obviously cannot represent the city, but its position on the altar indicates that it is symbolic of none other than the patron divinity herself: that here-at least-Athena is represented by her owl. But this vase is not unique in the prominent position it bestows upon Athena's owl. Throughout the course of Greek art and upon objects of widely different artistic merit the subject can be traced, as I hope to show by a few examples. 1 Farnell, Cults of the Greek States, i. p. 290. 2 F.

DOUGLAS In Homer the epithet of Athena was 7Xa,/u'rs, a term which must mean more than merely bright-eyed, bfor that would be equally appropriate to other goddesses, whereas it is only to Athena that it is applied. It was the omen of the owl perching upon the shrouds which led the confederates to accede to the opinion of Themnistocles;4 and with this is to be compared the stratagem of Agathocles,5 who let out certain owls among his troops that the men might be encouraged by the sacred sign; in which he succeeded, '0 -lTEdv r olv,.ouvowo 8th B r 0oKeiv CepO elvat 7r giov 7oro 'A09av&amp;.' Still more striking is the passage from Aristophanes 'yXai) yhp ij&lt;v erplv yidXreaL 7 o-'rpaC7v 8dwr7a7o,' 6 and the comment of the scholiast thereon; ' FPXai3xa 7~v 'Avvvav xaXe.' Evidently to the men of that period the goddess was actually embodied in her owl. It has been suggested that the figure of the owl on the countless small aryballoi to be found in every museum has an apotropaic significance; but the fact that this is practically a repetition of the coin design, the owl associated with the olive twig, leads one to suspect that here, in a very crude and homely form, is a reference to Athena the protectress-apotropaic, yes- in the sense that the goddess is powerful to shield from evil, and that there- fore the design has a certain mystic force like the rough little medallion of a saint, bought for a few sous at some fair or noted shrine. The subject of the birth of Athena was a very difficult one for the primitive artist.' How was he to depict it without rendering it grotesque or belittling the majesty of the goddess ? Kleanthes of Corinth 8 is said to have been the first to attempt the task, but the subject became a popular one and the numerous examples on extant vases show that, although the details may vary, the artist usually adhered to a fixed scheme. Besides Zeus, Eileithyia is almost invariably present, Hephaistos, often Apollo as Citharoedus and other male and female divinities. It has been suggested 9 that the example in the British Museum No. 147 is the Attic prototype of the subject; but the very complexity and multiplicity of details point to a long development. In a few cases Athena is not visible, for it is the moment before the birth which is represented. In Munich is a b.-f. vase 10 which shows Zeus facing r., seated on a simple seat, the back formed by a lion's head. Before him stands Eileithyia making the usual gesture, and behind her Ares armed. Behind Zeus Apollo Citharoedus prepares to hymn the great event upon his eight-stringed lyre, whilst right in the background is Hermes, only the point of whose petasos remains. From the head of Zeus springs Athena all armed, and'upon his wrist perches her emblem, the owl. Unusual as the introduction of this last detail seems, yet this representation appears to have a prototype in a vase now in the Vatican.1 4 Plutarch, Themis. 12. 5 Diod.

He is clad in a long chiton ornamented with purple spots, and round his shoulders is a mantle with broad purple stripes. In his 1. he holds a sceptre, the end shaped like a shepherd's crook. Facing him to the r. stands Eileithyia clad in an elaborately decorated garment, fastened upon the shoulders with enormous brooches. Behind her is Ares, and to the 1. behind the throne stands Poseidon with the trident in his r., and lastly Hermes, draped in a small purple chlamys. Beneath the throne is a diminutive youthful male figure, enveloped in his himation, but raising his covered r. in a gesture of adoration. Above the wrist of Zeus is perched the owl, turning its head fully towards the spectator; but no anthropomorphic image of the principal personage in this scene is visible. Evidently to the later artist of the Munich vase the owl symbol alone did not suffice, and he therefore added the anthropomorphic image of the goddess to elucidate the waning significance of the theriomorphic image. The Berlin Museum possesses an interesting fragment of a Corinthian pinax,12 the votive offering of some local potter of the seventh century. On the 1. rises the great oven, before which is a tiny, bearded, grotesque figure, evidently apotropaic. On the 1. is the potter himself, stooping over his work; while perched on the top of the oven is a large owl. Miss J. Harrison in her description of this pinax 13 claims that the owl was also an apotropaic symbol, but the bird had not necessarily this significance. Each figure on the pinax is labelled with a name, but so far the inscription above the owl has not been satisfactorily explained. In Athens the protectress of the city was also patroness of the potter's craft,4 and in a vase in the Berlin Museum 15 she is depicted standing before the kiln, potent to avert all the demons of destruction so dreaded by the early artist. May one not suggest that on the pinax the owl, her constant attribute, represents the divinity under whose protection the potter had placed himself? E. Pernice, in his interesting article on these fragments 16 considers that here the owl cannot represent Athena, for in Corinth her place was taken by Poseidon. But the Berlin vase, No. 801, equally comes from Corinth and shows Athena in her human form as guardian of the oven. Other vases and fragments from Corinth show her associated either with Poseidon or with various heroes, and indicate that not only at Athens, but here also, in the city of her rival, her patronage of this craft was acknowledged. Of no artistic merit, but important for the light they throw upon the subject are the so-called loom-weights, little clay objects, probably of a votive nature, 60 to 70 mm. high.'7 They are plain on one side; on the other, in the niche formed by the projecting rim, is the figure of an owl, the body in profile, 1" Katalog der Berliner Vasensammlunyg, Nos. 683, 757, 822, 819.

But this is no common owl, for with human arms she holds a distaff and spins the wool, which seems to come from a calathos placed upon the ground. This undoubtedly refers to Athena Ergane, and these humble little objects afford an explanation how the owl became associated with the warrior goddess. Originally the attribute of Athena in her character of Ergane, the owl continued to be connected with her when the more martial side of her cult became predominant in Athens. But that this association was maintained even in a late period is shown by the gems from Berlin,'s (Fig. 3) which represent the helmeted head of Athena united to the body of an owl. c; ~S-u ~ e, 2:1 FIG. 3.-GEMS AT BERLIN.

Yet a reminiscence of her original embodiment is to be traced in the representations of the winged Athena, not to be confused with her later dupli. cation as Nike.19 An intaglio in the British Museum,20 (Fig. 4) of beautiful Fio, 4.

She raises her long chiton with one hand after the fashion of the Korai of the Acropolis, and holds the spear in her r. From her shoulders spring large wings of the type of the Asiatic Artemis. The vase showing Athena winged and wingless is well known; 1 but even more striking in this connexion is a vase in the Louvre.22 Athena, armed and holding her lance, is seated on a low stool; behind her on either side protrude her great wings, and on the edge of the 1. one is perched her owl. The recollection is growing hazy, the original significance of the wings is almost lost, and therefore the artist adds the owl, sunk from being the incarnation to the mere attribute of the divinity.
