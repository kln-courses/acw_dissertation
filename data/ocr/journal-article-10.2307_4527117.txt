<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE "GOLDEN MAN" OF FORMER HAN TIMES BY Homer H. DUBS We cannot of course be sure just when the first idol was worshipped in China. There is however a very interesting account that as early as 121 B.C. the Chinese discovered their western neighbors using what was unmistakably an idol, and that they brought this object back to China and worshipped it there. It is moreover described in such terms that in all probability this was the first idol to arrive in China. Its existence provides interesting data for the history of Buddhism. Not every anthropomorphic image is an idol, contrary to the impression given by the anti-idolatrous polemic in the Old Tes- tament. An idol is an object, anthropomorphic or theriomorphic in form, that is thought to be inhabited by some divinity. An idol is strictly not an object which itself has any power, but only an object which is the locus of a god. An object which is itself powerful is more properly called a charm. The ancient Chinese used charms. In the famous case of witch- craft and black magic M a which in 91 B.C. brought about the rebellion and death of Emperor Wu's Heirapparent, Liu Chii, the proof of his guilt dug up by the inquisitor Chiang Ch'uiig T'oung Pao XXXIII</page><page sequence="2">2 HOMER II. DUBS was a wooden image in the shape of a human being, made of T'ung wood 1). The San-fu Chiu-shih 2) says that Chiang Ch'ung had the Hfu" witches a-, who were helping him, make and hide this image. Such an image was probably an article used in the widespread form of sympathetic magic in which the person whom it was intended to injure (here Emperor Wu himself) was repre- sented by the image, and certain things (injury, etc.) were done to this image, with the expectation that similar things would happen to the person represented. Anthropomorphic objects used in such magical practises are plainly not idols, even though they might have been considered to have great power. The ancient Chinese seem to have followed the same practise as that found in the Confucian temple today and in ancestral worship, of using a tablet with the name of the divinity written or engraved upon it to indicate the locus of the divinity. This object was called a j. Worship was directed to this tablet. For a people who honored the written word, such a practise was quite appropriate. Indeed there is no real difference, except in shape, between the tablet and the idol. Both are powerful and worshipped, not because of any power inherent in the object, but only because they are the locus of the divinity. A tablet functions in precisely the same way that the idol does. A tablet is not however suited to an illiterate people, and is appropriate only among a peoplc with a literature and high reverence for writing. That the ancient Chinese understood correctly the precise simi- larity in function between the tablet and the idol is shown by the phrase in which Pan Ku refers to the object we shall discuss, 1) I * A iS 45 :13b9. We shall denote the Han-8hu by the abbreviation IfS, and quote the paging of Wang Hsien-ch'ien's edition (1900) m 2) - "n $, probably written 3rd cent. A.D.</page><page sequence="3">THE "GOLDEN M&amp;N" OF FORMER HAN TIMES 3 "the [people of] Hsiu-t'u made a golden man as the tablet for worshipping Heaven" 1). Among ignorant people however, the idol, which is properly only the indication of the precise spot where the spiritual divinity is to be found, often degenerates into the charm, or object powerful in itself. It requires indeed some intelligence to distinguish between the material objects, the idol or the tablet, and the spiritual divinity which inhabits the object. The occurrence of an idol as distinguished from a charm indicates an advance in religion not to be expected among really primitive peoples, but only among those who have already made some progress in civilization and thus have achieved the necessary sophistication. Hence in the same culture in which intelligent persons worship idols, ignorant persons frequently do not distinguish the idol from the divinity, making the idol into a mere charm. An idol is moreover not any image or representation of a divinity, but only that representation which is inhabited by the divinity. Perhaps the most striking illustration of this fact is the treatment the ancient Greeks gave their images. We are told that after Phidias' wonderful statues of Athena were set up in the Acropolis, the people admired and contemnplated them, but continued to pay their worship to the ancient crude wooden image to which they had been accustomed to pay reverence. Only the ancient image was the locus of the god; the newer ones might be vastly more beautiful, but their worship was useless, for the god was not there. The ancient Chinese likewise had images of some divinities. When Emperor Wu built the Fei-lien Lodge in 109 B.C., he put above it a copper image of the Fei-lien. This 1) -WM 1-P _ A Xl Xl XC _ . HS 68 : 23b9.</page><page sequence="4">4 HOMER H. DUBS image was taken down in 62 B.C. and put above the P'ing-lo Lodge. Later it was melted into cash. Fei-lien j was a god of the wind who "made the wind and vapor come". This image was probably in the shape of a dragon with the head of a bird 1). Its location on top of a high building shows that it was obviously not intended for an idol, since worship would be impossible there. It may have been intended as a charm to secure the good will of this powerful god in protecting the palace from damage, as many of the decorations upon Chinese roofs today. One cannot then call every image an idol, unless one knows how the image was treated, for only a special attitude to an image on the part of people makes it an idol. It is then especially interesting to be told that the object we are about to discuss was really an idol and not a more image. In the summer of 121 B.C., the famous general Ho Ch'ii-ping made a raid westwards from the imperial capital, Ch'ang-an, into what is now central Kansuh. There he conquered the Hunnish kingdom of Hsiu-t'u 4 M 2). Out of that region was later made the Wu-wei Commandery ` , , which was located around the present city by the same name, the Ch'ing dynasty's Liang- chou Fu, Kansuh 5). In three different passages Ho Ch'ii-ping is said there to have "captured a golden [or gilded] man used by 1) Comments on IIS 57: ii, 17b. 2) Szu-ma Cheng (fl. 713-742), in a note to SC 111 : 8a, quotes Chang Yen (prob. 3rd cent.) as saying that the second word of this name is pronounced the same as but Karlgren, Analytical Dictionary, gives for the latter word an ancient pro- nunciation beginning in d'; hence we have retained the modern pronunciation t'u.

Ho Ch'ii-ping brought it back with him, possibly to take away from these people the protection of their god. We have contemporary evidence for this capture; Szu-ma Ch'ien probably saw this object brought back while he was working upon his history. The reiterated mention of this object, together with the curious untechnical phrase used for it, I A, seems to indicate that an idol was something new and strange to the Chinese and that it was the first idol seen by them. It is also plain that the Huns at this time considered Heaven to be an anthropomorphic deity and that the Chinese at least found nothing to wonder at in such a conception. The Hun emperor, the Shan-yii, became angry at his vassals, the Kings of Kun-hsieh and of Hsiu-t'u (who were neighbors to each other), because they had been defeated by the Chinese. He planned to summon them to court and execute them. Consequently they decided to surrender to the Chinese. In the autumn of 121 B.C. they and their people were received at the border by Ho Ch'ii- ping. At the last moment the King of Hsiu-t'u repented, but the King of Kun-hsieh promptly killed him and carried out the sur- render. The murdered king's wife and two sons were then treated as captives by the Chinese and enslaved to the government, being 1) The biography of Chin Jih-ti, HS 68 :18b reads A 4 g tE W 46 )t .

From the above wording we are unable to tell whether this idol. was solid gold or gilded. That . means gold seems certain from the regular use of this word in this sense in the HS, whether qualified by the adjective jfj or not. We are not told how many golden images were obtained; but, since Heaveia was conceived as a single anthropo- morphic god, in all probability only one image was secured. Yet when the Hanemperor worshipped Heaven, he also worshipped the Five Emperors, so that we cannot be quite sure of there having been only one image. Wei Shou (see below) thought there were more images than one.</page><page sequence="6">6 HOMER H. DUBS sent to the imperial palace where the boys were made to care for the horses. The oldest boy later became a favorite of Emperor Wu and rose to become the Emperor's closest attendant and personal guard. He saved the Emperor from assassination, and, at the Emperor's death, was made one of the regents, being second only to Ho Kuang. We are told explicitly that "originally, because the Ilsiu-t'u had made a golden man to be the tablet for worshipping Heaven, [Emperor Wu] granted him the surname Chin." He was Chin Jih-ti (or Chin Mi-ti) 1). Such a portentous object as an image indwelt by the greatest god of the sky, Heaven, could not be treated lightly by the Chinese, even if they had captured it in war. In the HS "Trea- tise on Geography", sub the city of Yuin-yang w Js, there is the statement: "There is [there] the Temple of the Golden Man [from the kingdom of] Hsiu-t'u, together with the Spirit of the Ching-lu, [with] three places [for sacrificing]"2). Yiin-yang was an ancient city even in Han times. On the Kan-ch'iian Mountain, or at its foot, near Yiin-yang, the First Emperor of the Ch'in dynasty had built the Kan-ch'iian Palace s 7^tt. Emperor Wu enlarged it so that its circuit was nineteen li, and it became his favorite summer residence8). The fact that Yuin-yang is said to have been an "ancient city" implies that it was a sacred place. The Kua-ti-chih 4) says that at the Kan-ch'iian Palace was "lthe place of the round hill [used for] worship since the time of the Yellow Emperor".

In it there were terraces and chambers designed for Heaven, Earth, the Great One $- [the supreme deity], and the various manes and divinities. He moreover established the utensils for sacrifice in order to cause the divinities of heaven to come [down to the Palace]". This idol was thus set up in a special temple in the ancient sacred prefecture of Yiin-yang, near the palace (Wei Shou thinks it was in the latter). The Kua-ti-chih said that "the Temple to the Spirit of the Ching-lu is in Yung-chou, 90 li northwest of Yiin-yang Hlsien, at the foot of the Kan-ch'uian Mountain", and that "the Kan-ch'iian Palace is in Yung-chou, 80 ii northwest of Yun-yang", so that this Temple was about ten li from the Palace1). 1) Ibid. II, 6b, 7a. M eng K'ang (ca 180-260) is quoted by P'ei Yin (fl. 465-472) in a note to SC 110: 22b as saying. "The place where the Huns worshipped Heaven was originally at Yun-yang, at the foot of the Kan-ch'uan Mountain. The Ch'in [dynastv] took their territory. by force and then transported them [to another place]. The King of Hsiu-t`u [occupied] the western [part of the Hun] territory, hence had the golden man [used in] the worship of Heaven, like a tablet for the worship of Heaven". But Ts'ui Hao (381-450, an enemy of Buddhism; J. R. Ware, fTP 1933, p. 109, note, in translating the following passage in part, has missed the point of this remark), objects: "In the Hun worship they used a golden man as a tablet. At present the Buddhist i golden men are these [sort of things]. Meng [K'ang's] explanation is perhaps wrong. How could they have obtained Buddhist golden men and later established them at Kan-ch'fian?" Shen Ch'in-han (1775-1831), in a note to IIS 94 : i, 18b, points out that in 237 B.C., the First Emperor settled his Queen Dowager in the Kan-ch'uan Palace (cf. Chavannes, Mimoires kistoriques, II, 113) and in 233 B.C. Han Fei died at Yun-yang, (ibid. 117), so that Yun-yang was Chinese territory from early times. From the very location of Yun-yang, southwest of the present Shun-hua iWA4 Shensi, so near to Ch'ang-an that the city could be seen from the Palace, it is difficult to believe that it could have been a Hun sacred place. The early rulers of Ch'in did indeed conquer their territory from the barbarians, but these barbarians were Jung, not Huus. Meng K ang seems to be arguing merely from the fact that this idol was set up at Yun-yang to the conclusion that it mulst have originally been there. A quite different reason for its presence there is given below. The Kua-ti-chik and subsequent accounts have adopted Meng K'ang's error.</page><page sequence="8">8 HOMER H. DUBS Pan Ku, in the first century A.D., found the temple still there. The rest of the statement about this temple requires a little explanation. HS 94 : ii, Sb notes the Hun Shan-yii at a parti- cularily solemn ceremony, using a ching-lu sword 1M t 7) 1) and Ying Shao (ca. 140-206), in a note, says: "A ching-lu is a Hun precious sword W 7J". But HS 25: ii, 9a 2 also says: 'In Yiin-yang there is the Temple to the Spirit of the Ching-lu for the worship of the King of Hsiu-t'u" 2). Thus the temple at Yiun-yang was not a temple to a famous sword, but to a dead man, the King of Hsiu-t'u. How could a conquered Hun king have come to be worshiped near a Chinese imperial Palace? The answer to this question is probably to be found in the personality of Chin Jih-ti, the son of this Hun King. He became a prime favorite of Emperor Wu, who enlarged the Kan-ch'iian Palace and spent much time there. After Chin Jih-ti's mother died, Emperor Wu had a portrait of her painted in the Kan-ch'iian Palace with the inscription. "The Queen of the King of Hsiu-t'u ). If Emperor Wu thus honored Chin Jih-ti's mother, he would also be likely to honor his favorite's deceased father, especially as both deceased parents required worship and care. Hence it was 1) Cf. de Groot, Die flunnen, p. 223. 2) -W J0 flt1 *M 51 pi g1X 3) 1 M I j j HS 68 : 196.

Chavannes (ibid. p. 27) thinks that the statue is of Chin Jih-ti's father, but the dramatic storv told in HS ch. 68, telling of the son'3 filial weeping before the picture of his mother, together with the absence of any reference in history to a statue of his father, makes it practically certain that his mother was represented.</page><page sequence="9">THE "GOLDEN MAN" OF FORMER HAN TIMES 9 most natural that a shrine to this man should have been established near the Kan-ch'iian Palace. The King was doubtless buried near the place where he was murdered, at the border; Chin Jih-ti probably possessed his sword, a ching-lu, which term seems to have been the Hun name for a particular kind of sword'). That sword would naturally have been put in his shrine to be the locus of his spirit; for this reason and possibly also to avoid mentioning the name of an enemy, the temple came to be called by its peculiar title, "The Temple to the Spirit of the Ching-lu". At this place, according to HS 28: I, i, 30a, there was also a temple where Yiieh practises, from south China, were carried on, so that this locality seems to have been devoted to foreign divinities. It is moreover quite natural that the relics of the King of Hsiu-t'u should have been put in the same temple as the Hsiu-t'u idol. Thus there was set up in Chinese territory a Chinese teinple containing an idol, which was probably worshipped along with the King of Hsiu-t'u. The Chinese had their own altars to Heaven, and needed no foreign idol for that purpose. But they would also have been unwilling to mistreat a locus of that powerful god by depriving it entirely of worship, hence continued to give it some kind of worship. Later the temple came to be known for the sword, and the "golden man" seems to have disappeared. Possibly it was solid gold. The question naturally arises how the Hsiu-t'u, located in central Kansuh, not far from Chinese territory, could have secured an idol. The most natural supposition is that it came to them through Buddhist influence, just as later the Buddhists brought 1) [Cf. Hirth's proposed etymology from Turkish kingrak ,,a two-edged knife, a sabre" in The Ancient History of China pp. 65-67 and Karlgren's discussion of this etymology from a phonetic point of view in Philology and ancient China p. 1 37. J. J. L. D.]</page><page sequence="10">10 HOMER H. DUBS idols to China. The Kua-ti-chih and the Ch'any-an Chih 1) both say that the Hsiu-t'u "golden man was a golden Buddhist image." But the Hsiu-t'u entered China in 121 B. C. and were settled in Chinese territory at the northern border of China, yet we hear nothing of any Buddhism among them. Not even the later Buddhists attributed any Buddhist influence to this people, altho they did attribute such an influence to this idol. The son of their king, Chin Jih-ti, became so distinguished in the Chinese court that we are told about his personal peculiarities and about his mother, yet no hint of any Buddhism is given. This idol was furthermore used for the worship of Heaven, who was not a Buddhist deity and was of no great importance to the Hindus, whereas Heaven was worshipped by the Hun and the Chinese rulers as their highest god. There was thus nothing Buddhist about it, except that it was an idol. The Hsiu-t'u can hardly themselves have been Buddhists. Then it might have been possible that the Hsiu-t'u them- selves made this idol for the worship of Heaven. Pan Ku himself says that they made it, altho he seems to have had no more evidence for that hypothesis than the fact that they possessed this object. But important cultural features, such as idolatry, do not occur in a vacuum. If the Hsiu-t'u were idolaters, we can reason- ably infer that the Huns, to whom they belonged, were also idolaters. Yet in the long account of the Huns in the SC and HS, nothing is said of any idolatry among them. Nothing is also said of any idols captured from the Kun-hsieh, who were conquered by Ho Ch'ii-ping at the same time as the Hsiu-t'u. The latter seem to have been the only tribe possessing an idol. This idol was furthermore no private article; it was "used by the King of 1) k g? ,:k&gt;, by Sung Min-ch'iu, 1019-1079.</page><page sequence="11">THE "GOLDEN MAN " OF FORMER HAN TIMES 11 the Hsiu-t'u to worship Heaven", so that it was used in the national worship. If then this idol was made by the Hsiu-t'u for their national worship, we have a right to expect that idols were also used freely in other worship. Such a circumstance would naturally draw attention from a non-idolatrous people such as the Chinese, and we should hear about it in some of the accounts given of this people. But nothing is said anywhere about it. While the argument from silence is never very strong, yet so many circumstances combine here that this "golden man" seems to have been the only idol possessed by the Hsiu-t'u. We can then be reasonably sure that the Hsiu-t'u did not themselves make this idol. One other explanation for the presence of this idol among the Hsiu-t'u can be given, but it raises problems important for the history of religion in central Asia. De Groot tells that the Ilsiu-t'u territory was previously occupied by the Indo-seythae AR5 who were driven out of that region and pushed westwards by the Huns in 176 B.C. HS 61: 4a says, "The Wu-sun... originally lived, together with the Indo-seythae, in the small states between the Ch'i-lien [Mountains (the present Nan-shan)] and Tun-huang". About a century and a half later, Buddhism was strong enough among these same people so that they sent missionaries to China. Can it have been that they were already Buddhists or had received enough Buddhist influence before they were driven out, so that they were already idolaters, and that when the Hun Hsiu-t'u drove them out, the latter captured this golden idol from them and used it to worship the greatest god of the Huns, Heaven? Such a procedure is quite in acword with what we know about the transmission of religion. Yet the acceptance of this hypothesis necessitates the inference, that we must date as early as the be-</page><page sequence="12">12 HOMER H. DUBS ginning of the second century B.C., and possibly somewhat earlier, the transmission of Buddhism to almost the western border of China and its acceptance by the Indo-seythae there to such an extent that they had already made important Buddhist shrines, so that the king of the tribe who expelled them took an image left behind by them as the proper thing for the worship of his own greatest god. In the absence of confirmatory evidence, this hypothesis seems difficult, yet we can think of no other plausible explanation for the origin of this idol. It is natural that the account of this idol should have later been given a decidedly Buddhist turn. Wei Shou (506-572), in his chapter on Buddhism in the History of the WJei Dynasty, tells the story we have recounted above with variations 1). He plainly implies that there was more than one golden statue 2), and that they averaged more than ten feet in height. He also says, "No sacrifices [were made to them], but there was only burning of incense and ceremonial bowing [to them]. This then marks the beginning of the circulation of Buddhism [in China]'. Wei Shou's family maintained Buddhist monks, so that this pious amplification of the legend might have come to him from them. He does not seem to have looked up the original sources in the SC or HS, for both state plainly that the golden man was used to worship Heaven - which fact contradicts Wei Shou's version. This fact alone is enough to show that he took his account from a tradition, rather than from the original sources. The statement that these golden statues were given only bloodless (Buddhist) worship would seem also to go back to a pious Buddhist legend. While the HS says nothing about the sort of worship 1) Translated by J. R. Ware, TP, 1933, 100-181. 2) Ibid., p. 108, n. 6.</page><page sequence="13">THE a GOLDEN MANn OF FORMER HAN TIMES 13 given this idol, yet that worship was doubtless similar to the worship given to Heaven at the time - which was the usual offering of prayer, saorificed animals, etc. Wei Shou's amplification of this legend, making it the origin of Buddhism in China, is moreover contrary to an earlier Buddhist statement in the Mou-tzu Li-huo 1), to the effect that Buddhism first arrived in China at the time of the dream of Emperor Ming 2). The same account as that found in the History of the Wei Dynasty is found in the same words in a quotation from the Han- Wu Ku-shih to be found in the Ye-k'o Tsung-shu 3). Present copies of the Han-Wu Ku-shih say that it was written by Pan Ku, but that statement is certainly erroneous. This book was attributed, with considerable probability, to Wang Chien I , 1) Dated by Pelliot, TP, XIX: 262, at the end of the 2nd cent. 2) TP XIX: 311. 3) - _ $ $ in the 3 f H by Wang Mou E t, pub. 1201, which is now included in the Pai-hai 5 f j.

This passage is however not to be found in the present editions of the lan-Wu Ku-shih. That book has suffered considerable loss and the present text seems to be a drastic revision. I have consulted the three editions available here, that included in the Ku-chin Yi-shih tj 4 S , vol. 15, in the Li-tai Hsiao-shih M f ~,Ji r, ch. 4, p. 4b, and that in the Shuo-k'u ? a ) vol.

They all agree in saying, "Thereupon [Emperor Wu] mobilized several hundred thousand soldiers and sent Ho Ch'ii-ping to punish the Hun [kingdom of] Che-lan [cf. de Groot, Die Hunnen, p. 121] and passed by Chii-yen [a place southwest of the Gashun-gol (also called the Chu-yen Lake) in northern Ninghsia]. He captured the golden man [used] to worship Heaven 3 W X ,A l [and], at the Shang-lin [Park], dug the K'un-ming Pond". The account in the present text flatly contradicts that quoted in the Ye-k'o Tsung-shu, and agrees with the aecount in the SC and HS. I suspect that the present text of the Han-Wu Ku-shih is an attempt by Wu Kuan Mi fg (fl. dur. 1567-1572, who printed the Han-Wu Ku-shih in his Ku-chin Yi-shih) or some one else to patch up a fragmentary work.

Wei Shou's use of this tradition and his failure to look for or to use the original account, which is easily to be found in the HS or SC, one of which books at least he must have had, shows his deficiency in the scholarly attitude to history. 1) Cf.
