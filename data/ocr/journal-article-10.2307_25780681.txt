<plain_text><page sequence="1">Another Look at the Pegtymel' Petroglyphs Richard L. Bland Abstract Petroglyphs are a relatively common form of prehistoric communication, in the sense that those who drew the petroglyphs knew what they meant, as no doubt did many of their fel low tribesmen who viewed them. The meaning or significance of these images, however, was generally specific to the individual or group that created them. There was never a cross-cultural standardization of symbols and as a result much of the meaning of many petroglyph series has been lost. But has it been entirely lost for all groups of petroglyphs? This article takes a close look at the Pegtymel' petroglyphs of Northeast Asia with that question in mind. Petroglyphs are intriguing pieces of communi cation from prehistoric times. They are found throughout the world?Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Europe. When we encounter them we often try to decipher what they mean. In gen eral, however, we quickly conclude that viewing the petroglyphs as early art is about as far as we can go. Or is it? In the mid-1980s a University of Oregon English professor, William Strange, became enam ored with petroglyphs. He traveled around Ore gon giving talks about them from his perspective. His contention was that petroglyphs should be viewed as prehistoric art, just as one might view a Rodin or a Michelangelo. He believed the petro glyphs could tell a story. Dr. Strange, in fact, had found a petroglyph of a lizard. The petroglyph had been created so that it was superimposed over a small hole in the rock, with the hole occurring between the reptile's hind legs. There was a fig ure of another creature, a goat, drawn on the same rock. After giving his views on how he thought petroglyphs should be read as art, Dr. Strange would launch into the story of Asshole Lizard and Mountain Goat, giving a poetic rendition of their peregrinations. Listening to Dr. Strange's talk, one could not help but agree that he had a point that petro glyphs were indeed art. But his analysis was like approaching a Rodin or Michelangelo from an an thropological point of view. It just did not seem to work very well. Was there an objective meaning, a common meaning behind petroglyphs that every one could understand independently? The pur suit of an interpretive method for analyzing petro glyphs soon reveals that many are the methods for viewing them. For example, one way of looking at petro glyphs is to take them at face value, see them as representations that are translatable by any viewer. This methodology is known as the empiricist ap proach. Willcox (1983:540), following this ap proach, believes that petroglyphs recorded impor tant events, served as means of instruction, and that the artist, while recording events and provid ing instruction, was expressing his or her artistic desire. Possibly from the opposite pole, David Lewis-Williams has carried out studies of San rock art in southern Africa (Lewis-Williams 1983). He concludes that petroglyphs express cognitive commonalities among humans (Wilson and Keil 2001:122). He believes common features in the forms or symbols in rock art are deeply embedded in the human mind. Lewis-Williams works with rich source materials. His studies, however, have certain advantages over petro glyph studies in other parts of the world in that Richard L.

Unlike the petroglyphs Lewis-Williams stud ied, much of the world's rock art has no attached ethnographic record. Most rock art is made up of illustrations that make little sense to the modern viewer. Such petroglyphs are found, for example, in northern Alaska and reported by Ralph Solecki (1952:64), who identifies them as "doodles." Other images portray everyday activities such as a man with a bow who is apparently aiming an arrow at a mountain goat, or a person conducting a ceremony possibly to appease the gods and summon good fortune. Petroglyphs of this kind can be found throughout the world in a more abstract form; namely, the pursued animal is represented but the hunter is understood, or the hunter is shown with his weapon and the animal is understood. In 1965 N. M. Samorukov, carrying out a geo logical survey in Chukotka, encountered engrav ings on rock outcrops along the Pegtymel' River about 60 km from the Arctic Ocean (Figs. 1 and 2). The landscape around the Pegtymel' River is roll ing tundra cut through by stream channels that trend toward the northwest and into the Arctic Ocean. Along the Pegtymel' River are occasional rock outcrops of silty sandstone on which petro glyphs have been created. Aware of the importance of what he had found, Samorukov took a couple of photographs of the images and sent them along with a letter to Nikolai N. Dikov, at that time one of the lead ing archaeologists in Northeast Asia.1 It stated that he had found petroglyphs on the rock outcrops along the river. Due to difficult logistics and ex pensive travel in the far north, it took Dikov two years to organize an archaeological expedition of three people (the site could be accessed essentially only by helicopter) to the area. Dikov had diffi culty finding the petroglyphs Samorukov had pho tographed. He did, however, find a different set. As he continued to search he discovered more and more images, ultimately finding and recording 104 panels of petroglyphs on an almost 2-kilometer long rock outcrop (Dikov 1999). These were the northernmost petroglyphs currently known. The Pegtymel' River is located approxi mately 800 kilometers west of Bering Strait (Figs. 1 I t *-\ l?~i 7 c^sw Pl)tymer River \ ""l A ( -"T^T^v^x^ C, Krueenatnm ^w^JO ] 1/ )il^^s Chukchi Sea CVtt^f^ iV&amp;V*** jf*^^ f Kotzebue C?V ^- ^^O*** /(f ^ Sound Y/nJh~ CHUKCHI P^W^ULA Btwn^J0 / \ ^-"N^J ^^^-^ Dtomede te? jfo?l SEWARD PENINSULA /-^ 1 Guif of Pfo^S ^ / ^cr Anadyr' c Chapina V ^^^X Cape Chukotski! _ . _ C ^ \ Bering Sea \ ?

It stretches for about 350 kilometers, form ing a barrier of sorts for migrating reindeer. Going to summer pastures near the ocean, the deer cross the river on the ice in spring and move northward. In the fall they swim across the river on their way back south, where they take shelter in the moun tains during winter. The natives who lived in the region during ethnographic times took advan tage of the fall migration of the deer to stock their larders when the deer were fat and healthy. The deer swimming the river were slow and essen 0 5 cm t i Figure 4. Baidar crew spearing a whale (Dikov 1999:156, Panel 99). tially helpless, enabling the men to paddle their boats out into the swimming herd of deer and spear them. The women and children dispatched the wounded and dying deer as they attempted to climb out onto the shore. These and other activ ities are what Dikov found depicted in the Peg tymeP petroglyphs. In 1968 Dikov returned with his crew and completed sketching and photographing the en graved petroglyphs and rubbed pictographs of a variety of subjects (Dikov 1999). The primary sub ject was deer. These animals were illustrated in a variety of poses, one of them being speared or har pooned in the water from a boat (Fig. 3). In addi tion, the petroglyphs depict the deer with splayed hooves (Fig. 3), just as they would be when swimming. The second most common illustrations were of anthropomorphic images?showing people in both small boats (single-person canoes or kayaks) and large boats [baidars, often with eight paddlers, [Fig. 4]). The individuals in small boats appear to be spearing deer, those in the large ones harpoon ing whales. One illustration of a large whaling boat has, in Dikov's view, a "winged object" (Fig. 5),2</page><page sequence="4">Bland: Pegtymel' Petroglyphs 25 Figure 5. Baidar and whaling crew, sea mammal, and ostensible "winged object" trailing whale. (Dikov Figure 6. Man and dogs taking a bear (Dikov 1999:133, 1999:143, Panel 58). Panel 24). Figure 7. Dogs driving deer. A man in a kayak spearing a deer (Dikov 1999:133, Panel 25). similar to the winged objects archaeologists have recovered from archaeology sites dated to the Old Bering Sea culture. Based on this, Dikov places his "winged object" in the "first seven to eight centu ries of the first millennium A.D." (Dikov 1999:47). Others illustrate a hunter with dogs pursuing a bear (Fig. 6) and driving deer with dogs, possibly into the river where spearing them would be eas ier (Fig. 7). Although remains of "an Eskimo-type domestic dog" are known from the Paleolithic of Northeast Asia (Dikov 1993:101), this scene actu ally might be the first to show one in use. Forming another large group of anthropo morphic images are unusual mushroom-headed people (Fig. 8), who probably represent individ uals or small groups of early residents carrying out ceremonies. Waldemar Bogoras notes that the Chukchi used the Amanita mushroom [Amanita muscaria) as an intoxicant. The Chukchi ingested it, putting themselves into a state of hallucination.</page><page sequence="5">26 Arctic Anthropology 47:2 Figure 8. Whalers and whale (fop); deer [middle); female and male mushroom-headed anthropomorphs [bottom] (Dikov 1999:129, Panel 14).</page><page sequence="6">Bland: Pegtymel' Petroglyphs 2 7 According to Bogoras (1909:282), anyone who in gested the mushroom saw as many mushroom people as mushrooms eaten. If someone ate one mushroom, he saw one mushroom person; if he ate two, he saw two mushroom people. Many of these images are obviously female. They have their hair in braids and appear to be wearing coverall like clothing [JcerJcer] (Fig. 8, lower left). The petroglyphs were engraved into the cliffs as an act of "hunting magic" (Dikov 1999:18)?an attempt to ensure a healthy, sizable herd of rein deer crossing the river at the appropriate time and place. Thus acquisition of supplies for winter de pended on the magic working. The mushrooms might have helped people "see" the time and place of the crossing. Dikov located and excavated three bur ied archaeological sites, one next to a rock shel ter containing petroglyphs. In the excavated sites he found flaked stone tools and bone artifacts as well as broken quartzite cobbles, readily avail able in nearby outcrops. These cobbles were prob ably used to peck the petroglyphs into the sand stone cliffs. None of the artifacts were diagnostic. One of the buried sites was inside the rock shelter and close to petroglyphs on the rock walls. Dikov collected charcoal from this site and submitted it for radiocarbon analysis, which dated it to 1460 ? 70 B.P. (MAG-18) (Dikov 1999:53). He believed he had correctly dated these petroglyphs, or at least come close, since the other buried sites were on top of the rock outcrops and not particularly close to petroglyphs. Dikov set out to determine the sequence of engraving on the rock face and who had made them. To do this he looked at the techniques of en graving and found that the illustrations had been created in three basic ways: by rubbing, scratch ing, and pecking the stone surface. Often an out line would be scratched or rubbed, followed by pecking of the area within the outline. However , images created by the different techniques over lapped in no particular order. The techniques of creating the petroglyphs did not appear to follow any chronological sequence. Next, Dikov divided the illustrations accord ing to style. His deer classification consisted of fig ures that were (Dikov 1999:31): 1. Truly realistic, filled with life and action 2. With wide chest, angular rump, and often exaggerated in emphasized realistic detail 3. More or less schematic, streamlined, with angular rump 4. Primitive, carelessly pecked, no special characteristics 5. Exaggeratedly massive, with heavy broad trunk and thick legs. Here again images of different styles over lapped and chronological order could not be deter mined by style alone. Dikov therefore created five "illustrative canons" (Dikov 1999:34): 1. Single figures of deer standing alone 2. A schematically depicted paddleless hunter sitting in a small boat and spearing a deer with a spear or harpoon 3. A hunter in a boat holding a double-bladed paddle and spearing a deer 4. A hunter in a boat and spearing a deer, but the paddle is overhead 5. A deer with a paddle overhead but no boat or hunter. Dikov created a table that shows his five il lustrative canons vertically (Fig. 9). Then he added his classifications of deer horizontally, beginning with the most realistic. Next he included what he called "accompanying forms," in which multi person boats (four classifications) and Amanita headed (mushroom-headed) humanoids (three classifications) were included. Dikov began with the assumption that the most realistic images of deer are the oldest?that with time the illustrators would make more sche matic illustrations, and seriated the images accord ingly. Following this reasoning, he arranged the deer in the table from most realistic to least real istic. Thus Canon I can be seen as the most realis tic (i.e., the earliest form of illustration). Canons II through V become more schematic and, in his view, later in time. He saw the double-bladed paddle, the source of movement, as being of ever-increasing importance in the hunting magic inherent in the il lustrations. The paddle gradually becomes more prominent in his chronological system. Thus, working on the assumption popu lar among many students of culture at that time, namely, that artistic styles were ail evolved cul tural process, going from simple (or realistic) to complex (or stylized), Dikov proceeded to organize the illustrations in what he believed was a range running from simple/realistic to complex/stylized. Based on this assumption the simplest, most re alistic illustrations would be chronologically ear liest, while the most complex, stylized would be chronologically latest. With this organization in mind, Dikov tried to assess each rock panel and determine its rel ative age. As noted earlier, he had been un able to determine the chronology of the petro glyphs according to technique, style, or content alone. Next he turned to what action is depicted in each panel. The majority of them contain im ages of deer and in them he saw illustrated the economic base (at least seasonally) of the hunt ers. Thus illustrations containing deer connected to small boats that hold individuals depict suc cessful hunters. But many illustrations also con tain images of large boats carrying several people;</page><page sequence="7">28 Arctic Anthropology 47:2 Accompanying Forms i Illustrative Canon 7* III IV Style of Deer Silhouettes 15 11 Figure 9. Classification table of the Pegtymel' petroglyphs (the numbers in the correlation fields indicate the number of petroglyphs Dikov located) (Dikov 1999:34). images of large fish, wolves or dogs surrounding deer; a bear-hunting scene; and Amanita-headed people. The views of wolves or dogs surround ing deer and the bear-hunting scene seem to fit the larger picture, that is, they represent a peo ple going about their daily round during seasonal hunting on the river. The images of boats contain ing several people are more problematic, as are the Amanita-headed people. Illustrations of large boats, especially those showing whales being har pooned, seem out of place here in the middle of the tundra. Nevertheless, the petroglyphs are not far from the ocean. These could arguably symbol ize a culture that exploited a marine resource (sea mammal hunting) during one part of the year and migrating deer during another part of the year. This would represent a time prior to the relatively well-established Chukchi reindeer herders vis-a vis the Coastal Chukchi and Eskimos of the ethno graphic period. Here a problem arises. Dikov's table (Fig. 9) shows the most realistic (least schematic) Amanita headed people in correlation with the most sche matic (least realistic) canons. That is, the most re alistic Amanita-headed images correlate to Canons IV and V. And this is true with the multi-hunter boats as well. Dikov ignored this problem in his organizational scheme. His plan was to determine not only the rela tive age of the panels but also to identify the eth nic group that created them. Assuming, based on available archaeological data, that maritime hunt ing began no earlier than the first millennium B.C., Dikov suggested that the illustrations of individ ual deer predate this, being at least as early as the beginning of the first millennium B.C. (Dikov 1999:39). Based on the radiocarbon date of 1460 ? 70 B.P from a hearth in the rock shelter archaeology site, Dikov felt that "the majority of silhouetted petroglyphs we found in the cave can be assigned to this time" (Dikov 1999:53), and that this, along with the "winged object" (now considered by many a harpoon counterweight), places many of the petroglyphs in Old Bering Sea times. Since no illustrations feature reindeer herding, Dikov sup posed that the upper date for the petroglyphs pre cedes that occupation, that is, precedes about A.D. 1500 (Dikov 2004:178). Dikov identified three ethnic groups as most likely to have ancestors in the area of northern and eastern Chukotka at the time the petroglyphs were created: Yukagir, Chukchi, and Eskimos. He began to rule out the Yukagir because they lacked large boats, although small boats, generally canoes, were part of Yukagir culture. Some of the anthropomor phic figures appear to wear their hair in braids (Fig. 4, lower left and third from left). The wear ing of braids was characteristic of the ethnograph ically known Yukagir. Wearing kerker was quite foreign to the Yukagir, but was common attire for the Chukotka Eskimos (Fig. 8, bottom left). The Chukchi had many names for the Amanita and used it ethnographically as an intoxicant, while</page><page sequence="8">Bland: PegtymeV Petroglyphs 29 the Eskimos studiously avoided what they called "devils' ears" (Dikov 1997:157, Note 7). Dikov concluded that the material culture of the Coastal Chukchi and the Eskimos were al most indistinguishable. In order to separate these two groups, Dikov turned to art. Most of the il lustrated Amanita-headed people seem to be fe male. Some appear to be wearing an item of cloth ing characteristic of the Chukotka Eskimos, a suit similar to coveralls (Fig. 8)?an item that also was uncharacteristic of the Yukagir. This was another reason to eliminate the Yukagir as the creators of the illustrations. The Eskimos were the primary users of kayaks and baidars; and Dikov found a reference in Birket-Smith (1929:255) to a petro glyph that probably shows Caribou Eskimos hunt ing from a kayak. The Coastal Chukchi also used these boats. In the end, Dikov could not associ ate the petroglyphs with any known ethnographic group. In 2007 Margarita Kiriyak published a work in which she discusses the Pegtymel' petro glyphs and though she agrees with much of what Dikov says about the petroglyphs, she finds prob lems with some of his analyses. She observes that Dikov placed both the anthropomorphs and the large boats in reverse chronological order in his table, that is, the more stylized anthropo morphs and large boats are shown as earlier, con trary to his stated order. She says that Dikov's goal of following the images from realistic to stylized is "not reinforced by clear arguments" (Kiriyak 2007:241). Drawing on and discussing a number of stud ies of petroglyphs in Asia and Europe, Kiriyak concludes that the petroglyphs at Pegtymel' rep resent not just a location where the people har vested reindeer, but a ceremonial site where sum mer and fall festivals took place. She examines illustrations on a prepared seal skin approximately one meter square that was acquired by American sailors in the 1860s or 1870s in Chukotka (Kiri yak 2007:260). The skin is covered with hundreds of figures of deer, whales, boats, and other illus trations that represent the detailed daily life of the coastal Chukchi and Eskimos, and Kiriyak ob serves that the figures are nearly identical to the Pegtymel' petroglyphs. Discussing the ethnography of the Yukagir, Kiriyak finds that the use of small boats, the spear ing of reindeer as they swam across rivers, the wearing of braids, and other traits are character istic of the Yukagir. Ultimately, she too is unable to select one ethnic group over another as the cre ators of the petroglyphs. This essentially brings us full circle. The meaning of the figures in the rock is to some extent lost, and now the meaning is in the eye of the be holder. We can let our ethnographic imaginations run free and think of native men and women wait ing along the banks of the PegtymeF River. Those who are artistically inclined make images of deer, boats, and other objects aimed, perhaps, at invok ing a good harvest. While they are waiting, the shaman ingests Amanita mushrooms, putting him or-herself in an intoxicated state during which he or she will be able to predict the size of the herd, where they will approach the river, and so on. Hiding among the rocks, the hunters wait un til the deer begin the river crossing. Then they rush down, launch their boats, and begin spearing them; the women and children dispatch the ani mals that make it to shore. In many regions petroglyphs consist largely of spirals, lightning bolts, squiggly lines, and solar symbols. Some are even identified as "doodles." These petroglyphs certainly meant something to the artists and their communities, but little can be determined from them now. The Pegtymel' petro glyphs, by contrast, document the way of life of a people of extreme Northeast Asia. They provide a fairly good record of how the people lived even though their ethnic association is unknown. The petroglyphs display hunter and hunted, man and animal, male and female, economic and ceremo nial life, and riverine and maritime hunting. The PegtymeP River petroglyphs impart much more knowledge even than many archaeological excava tions of hunter-gatherer sites. I would like to suggest that from these petro glyphs, in combination with local archaeolog ical sites, more information might be obtained than by analyzing either the petroglyphs or bur ied sites alone. While Dikov recovered little infor mation that shed light on the petroglyph makers at the time of his excavation, it would be worth sur veying the area again. This is a land of perma frost where clothing, wooden and bone tools, and perhaps even human remains might be found that would offer more direct information about the people who created the petroglyphs and the meaning of the images, and vise versa. Neverthe less, the petroglyphs alone are an enduring record of a past way of life carved in the stones of North east Asia. Along these lines one might say, in the spirit of this Festschrift, that Don Dumond has carved images, legible in varying degrees, on the aca demic souls of his students and associates, and like the petroglyphs' his impact will be long last ing. As Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote, "I am a part of all that I have met." I think we can say there is a part of Don Dumond etched in all of us. Acknowledgments.

Nikolai Dikov was born in Russia in 1925. In 1944 he began studies in history at Moscow State University, transferring in 1949 to the Archaeology Department at Leningrad University. He studied under the scholars B. B. Piotrovskii, A. P. Oklad nikov, and M. E. Masson and went on archaeologi cal expeditions to Transcausia, Turkmenistan, and Siberia. In 1955 Dikov went to Chukotka to devote himself to the study of Northeast Asia. In 1960, in Magadan, the Northeastern Interdisciplinary Sci entific Research Institute was organized and Dikov was asked to head the Laboratory of Archaeology, History, and Ethnography, which he did for 35 years. During that time he carried out numerous archaeological expeditions, making important discoveries, such as the Ushki sites in Kamchatka, and publishing many books and articles on his finds and his theories. Dikov died in St. Petersburg in 1996 (Lebedintsev 1997). 2. The "winged object" of the Eskimos has pro duced considerable speculation and comment among archaeologists and others over the past half century or so regarding its function. S. I. Rudenko (1972:Plates 9:11, 38:3) illustrates them, as do Arutiunov and Sergeev (2006a:165-174, Figs. 84-93; 2006b:120-131, Figs. 48-59), Sukho rukova (2006:26, Fig. 2), Bronshtein (2009:144, 146, 147, Figs. 7-9). The objects were thought by Dikov (1964:20-22 cited in Arutiunov and Sergeev 2006b:134) to be cult items to "illustrate the female progenitor." Rudenko stated that "Its purpose is not clear, though it was probably the representation of a bird, or more likely, a but terfly, with added head and tail, which was sus pended on straps during a whaling ceremony" (Rudenko 1972:46 cited in Arutiunov and Sergeev 2006b:133). Arutiunov and Sergeev (2006b:135) state the following: "In 1960 an Eskimo from Naukan, Utoek, said that the "winged object" was a breasthook on a kayak and . . . joins all the wooden parts of the kayak on the bow." Neverthe less, Collins's (1937:201) idea that they might be an item for stabilizing a harpoon has remained. In fact, quite recently Mikhail Bronshtein (2009:145) stated that the "winged object" is a "harpoon counterweight." References Cited Arutiunov, Sergei I and Dorian A.
