<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews photographic picturing of the Indian is read as a belated nostalgia for the 'vanishing West'. This pictorial figuring is a failure, or refusal, to read their evidence as a pertinent pre-history to the European settlement of America, despite the 'curiosity' value of ancient Indian ruins in the cafions of the Mesa Verde, the Hopi pueblo at Walpi, or the Taos settlements. So much for Ruskin's few stones! These essays are gathered under three headings, 'Prospects', 'Anglo-American Perspectives', and 'American Illustrations', and as Leo Marx notes in his instructive foreword, these sections deal sequentially with the equivocal patrimony of Old World aesthetics, the textual and visual evidence of Anglo-American relations, and representations of the vernacular style grounded in particulars of the American experience. They uncover a common nexus of problems in the endeavours to read the landscape, whether in literary or visual terms. Following Jacob Burckhardt, Olaf Hansen asserts that our modern experience of nature dates from 1336, the date of Petrarch's account of his ascent of Mont Ventoux, which realizes 'that the use of nature is to turn our view away from it and to direct it towards the self'. Dr Hansen then cites Henry Thoreau, the expeditionary geologist Clarence King, and the photographers Timothy O'Sullivan and Alfred Steiglitz to elaborate that pro- position, and to assert that 'whenever the idea or the concept of landscape becomes a serious issue, the self-definition of mankind will be at stake'. Clive Bush's intellec- tually allusive 'Reflections on the Perception of Space and Landscape' argues that Americans failed to realize the phenomenology of bodily space in relation to the double horizon of America as 'new earth' and 'unredeemed wilderness', and refused the evidence offered in many indigenous and expansionist communities of'ways of living with nature'. Stephen Fender shows how the very deficiency of a usable history in the early Republic led to an insistent emphasis on the trope of anticipation in American writing, and how the instability that arose from that deficiency led to the emergence of a truly original national literature. Two essays in this excellent collection are of particular interest: Robert Lawson- Peebles's reading of Dickens's response to his westward journey down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers in I842 offers the best account I have read of Dickens's abruptly horrified revulsion from the American landscape, which becomes a withdrawal from America itself. In place of that received figure of the 'Republic of the Imagination' Dickens was forced into confrontation with a swollen, raging, anthropomorphic 'ditch', whose effects upon him were dislocating and disorientating, in Lawson- Peebles's terms, and were not only filtered into American Notes from his letters but crucially exploited in Bleak House and Our Mutual Friend. Graham Clarke's account of the domestic typology of post-Revolutionary America in landscape painting, which considers the conflict between utilitarian and aesthetic views of landscape common to many of these essays, gives brilliant readings of two genre paintings by Ralph Earl to support his argument for the emergence of a native vocabulary in American painting which survives to this century. There are not enough illustrations in this book, so that one has constantly to go elsewhere to consult the visual evidence these writers refer to: and many of the illustrations given, such as those of Thomas Cole, are barely readable on this scale of production. UNIVERSITY OF READING LIONEL KELLY The Monological Jew: A Literary Study. By L. S. DEMBO. Madison and London: University of Wisconsin Press. 1988. xii+ I96pp. $32.50 (paperbound $I3.50). The 'monologicalJew' is a flexible, heuristic paradigm for understanding novels and poems by Jewish-American authors. It refers to any modern Jewish person en- trapped in I-It relationships as a result of competitive individualism, cultural I 000</page><page sequence="2">Reviews marginality, and loss of faith. Such a person violates the ideal of 'dialogic' (p. 6) communication defined by Martin Buber and Mikhail Bakhtin. Buber said that genuine dialogue requires an I-Thou relationship: mutual respect between or among speakers and a refusal ofmonological coercion and objectifying control. Like Buber, L. S. Dembo accepts the possibility of intersubjectivity and finds its ground in God or Logos. As for Bakhtin, his concepts of literary carnivalization and polyphony define situations in which authoritarian monologue is subverted through the liberating interplay of voices. Professor Dembo thus rejects Sartre's existentialist assumption that modern social life is inescapably dominated by distance, self- enclosure, and I-It relationships condemning each person to monologue. This study is alert to differences in character and situation. BruceJay Friedman's Stern escapes the I-It relation but only into the I-I relation of soliloquy. Edward Wallant's pawnbroker Nazerman, whose name suggests 'Nazi', has in his anti- dialogic catatonia come to resemble his monologic Nazi persecutors. The mono- logism of Leo Rosten's parodistic detective Silky has less to do with the anti- communicative ethos of the detective genre than with Jewish habits of verbal distance. Rosten's The Education of Hyman Kaplan focuses not on Bildung but on the tension between the monologic order imposed by Parkhill upon his ethnic students and the classroom polyphony or heteroglossalia permitting genuine dialogue. There follow sensitive essays on Philip Roth's Goodbye, Columbus, Henry Roth's Call it Sleep, Abraham Cahan's The Rise of David Levinsky, and Isaac Bachevis Singer's The Family Moskat. Professor Dembo goes on to criticize the Jewish 'Objectivist' poets as virtual idolators for mistakenly espousing not the liturgical, public stance of traditional Jewish culture but the coterie aesthetic of literary modernism. Moreover, whereas the Hasids grasp God through his creation, the Objectivists find objects significant only in the poet's awareness. The author sympathizes most with Charles Reznikoff, who is drawn to New York's 'lyric valuables' (p. 128) but also toJudaism. But Louis Zukofsky cultivates opaque monologism. Professor Dembo is less hard on George Oppen because not so much choice as circumstance made him a monologist. The problem is that one must share Professor Dembo's religious assumptions to agree with his judgements. To do so is to devalue most of literary modernism, yet it is hard to imagine what could take, or could have taken, its place. Part 4 defines Ezra Pound's radio broadcasts as inseparable from a monological authorial position which is typical of anti-Semitism and which reduces theJew to a voiceless object. What Professor Dembo notes as Pound's attempt to deprive the Jews of speech consorts with Pound's identification of the Jews in other contexts as anti-logos. It might have been noted, though, that Pound's many assumed voices in the broadcasts are an attempt to escape monologism. Professor Dembo rightly points out that Pound critics have evaded his anti-Semitism, and he deplores the false posture of detachment which leads them to discuss the broadcasts as an occasion for mere rhetorical and quantitative 'content' analysis. The ensuing treatment of Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises shows not only that Robert Cohn's Jewishness is essential to his character and the novel but that Jake Barnes's narration monologically excludes Cohn while expressing the author's anti- Semitism. Unlike most Hemingway critics, Professor Dembo sees the arbitrariness of Jake's scapegoating of Cohn and the resemblance among Cohn, Barnes, and Hemingway. Still, this doubling needs further discussion, as it leads to the scape- goating of Cohn at Pamplona - a carnival explained better by Rene Girard than by Bakhtin. Students of Girard might argue that Professor Dembo too readily identifies the carnival's disorder with the unifying logos. The carnival, he writes, 'degrades to uplift, destroys to resurrect, finds rebirth in all death' (p. 67). Would he say this of I00I</page><page sequence="3">Reviews the scapegoating violence resulting from the chaos of a 'carnival' such as the Russian Revolution? Yet Professor Dembo's belief in polyphony over monologism is equi- vocal. In his treatment of Call it Sleep he complains that the logos of the Hebrew language has been lost and then sympathizes with the rabbi who explodes angrily at the submergence of Hebrew in the babble of unruly students. The rabbi sounds like the monologic teacher Parkhill who stifles Hyman Kaplan's Yiddish- Americanisms. But if Professor Dembo's distinctions are sometimes blurred, what remains clear throughout this study is his admitted nostalgia for the public, dialogic, God-centred world of the stetl. UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI ROBERT CASILLO Third Solitudes: Tradition and Discontinuity in Jewish-Canadian Literature. By MICHAEL GREENSTEIN. Kingston, Ontario, and London: McGill-Queen's University Press. I989. viii + 232 pp. $29.95. In Third Solitudes Michael Greenstein re-creates the history of Jewish-Canadian literature in a racy, stimulating, but at times enervating discussion. Eleven author- centred essays (six previously published), plus an introduction and conclusion, chronicle through a post-structuralist perspective the historical development of Jewish-Canadian writing from A. M. Klein to the present. Characteristics of modern Jewish writing develop through an absorption of Kafka's 'negative', Buber's 'mismeeting', and the Frankfurt School's 'negative dialectics'. Such 'forerunners of Derrida's deconstruction with its emphasis on open-ended free play in language and interpretation, its need to undo Hegelian synthesis', lead to the criticism of Bloom and Hartman (pp. 8-io). This critical heritage parallels the perspective in which Jewish-Canadian writers are viewed. Their tradition is at once mimetic and developing: 'Tradition as discontinuity and adventure: just as Klein's dialectic both negates and incorporates earlier forms, so later Jewish-Canadian writers may rely on his example before parting company' (p. 7). 'Third solitude' describes the individual's state of alienation, neither in the tradition nor out of it: 'Without a final synthesis, negative dialectics creates its own third solitude' (p. 9). A summary of the moral thrust of those poets who come after Klein and are influenced by 'Hebrew and Yiddish humanism' (Irving Layton, Leonard Cohen, Miriam Waddington, Phyllis Gotleib, Eli Mandel) ends, 'all of these portraits oftheJewish poet as Canadian landscape [one of Klein's titles] reveal their empathy for downtrodden third solitudes' (p. 205). Those novelists who follow A. M. Klein and celebrate the hardship and virtues of the ghetto are Henry Kreisel, Norman Levine, Jack Ludwig, Adele Wiseman, Mordecai Richler, and Leonard Cohen. Monique Bosco and Naim Kattan form a special case: 'Separated from both English and French mainstreams, [they] see themselves as third solitudes, reaching out to connect cultures from a lost semitic world' (p. 206). But the formula of negative dialectics prescribes that their works will hinge on the futility of mismeetings, that making any connexion is impossible. Ironically, as if he were another of these 'third solitudes', Matt Cohen, subject of Chapter I , is omitted from this summary. Cohen breaks the thematic tradition, focusing instead on theJewish medieval heritage. Professor Greenstein is an advocate of Derrida's 'open-ended free play in language and interpretation'. Ground rules for the discussion of Adele Wiseman's Crackpot begin with didacticism and puns: 'Where structuralism deals with the metonymic relationship between container and contents, poststructuralist criticism deconstructs vessels, displaces inside and outside, and disperses meaning. Wiseman's decentring novel resembles a cracked pot whose fissures expose a I002</page></plain_text>
