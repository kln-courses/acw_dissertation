<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Neo-Romantic in the Natural World: Naturalism in James Dickey's Poetry MATTHEW GUINN 1 JAMES DICKEY'S LONG AND PRODUCTIVE CAREER as a poet has been checkered by a remarkably mercurial critical reception, ranging from effusive praise to the most vituperative criticism. While many critics extol the power of his poetry and its evocation of the natural world, others find his work devoid of moral considerations. The source of these disparate critical re- sponses to Dickey's poetry is the naturalistic strain which runs throughout his work. This naturalistic sensibility enhances the poems (giving his perennial first-person speakers an awareness of the world which moves beyond confessionalism, for example), but it has also shaped an outlook which many critics find repulsive. While readers such as Joyce Carol Oates praise Dickey for "giv[ing] voice to an era's hidden, atavistic desires" (Weigl and Hummer 64), critics like Robert Bly denounce him as "sick" and "sadistic" (Suarez 42). Thus while Dickey's brand of naturalism is the mov- ing force behind many of his best poems, it has also contributed to his downfall with critics since the 1960s.1 What is fundamental to an understanding of Dickey's work, then, is establishing the proper perspective from which to view the naturalistic strain in his work. In order to avoid erroneous judgments such as Bly's, one must qualify the common percep- tion of Dickey as a modern romantic poet, a poet of individual transcendence. Like other romantics, Dickey stresses the primacy of individual experience. But counter to the romantic tradition,</page><page sequence="2">88 MMatthew Guinn he refuses to impose anthropocentric concepts on the natural world; nature in his poetry is too immediate and primal to be a reified incarnation of abstract principles. Dickey's break from the romantic tradition is evident in his discussion of William Blake: But in the sense that Blake is a visionary poet, I'm not at all. I don't really believe that I can see God sitting up in that tree yonder, you know. Or any of the things, any of the visions that Blake said he saw or claimed to see. I'm sure he did. I hope he did. I would like to see something like that. Somebody said to Blake, "Now when you look at the sun do you see a disc about the size of a florin?" Blake said, "No, I see a great multitude of the heavenly hosts singing hosannas unto the most high." Now, I don't see that when I see the sun. It would be great if I did, but a visionary poet in that sense, I'm not. (Contemporary Literature 120) Dickey's perception of the natural world prevents him from entertaining Blake's visionary qualities. God does not inhabit a tree, nor is the sun's glory comprised of angels; the poet and his personae must interpret experience without such anthropocentric constructs. Transcendence may be affected through a return to nature, not in the sense of the Romantics (in which nature is subsumed to ideas) but rather by man's reclamation of a primitiv- ism obedient to the laws of nature. Transcendence must occur in a figurative sense within these limits-not by surmounting the laws of the natural world, but by integrating the self within them. By bringing naturalistic concepts to bear on romanticism, Dickey places a greater strain on the individual than Blake does. His post-Darwinian vision displaces humanity from a clearly as- cendant position in the cosmos. Dickey perceives the universe as a place in which anthropomorphic concepts of God are "absurd" (Contemporary Literature 121). Consequently, the individual is in- eluctably bound to the natural world: "A dead dog crushed on the highway has the same organs as you. It's got a heart, liver, kid- neys, bowels, all that. It's no different from you. All the differ- ence is that you have evolved into something that can think of and conceive of the idea of God" (130). Given such limitations, conventional romantic notions of transcendence are impossible. The individual can cultivate meaning only by beginning with the</page><page sequence="3">South Atlantic Review 89 tangible, by acknowledging the power and indifference of na- ture. Thus naturalism and romanticism achieve a kind of strange fusion in the poet's work. Although nature is "red in tooth and claw," this fact is not lamentable for Dickey, as it was for Tennyson. Instead, acknowledging the supremacy of the natural world pro- vides the individual with an opportunity to achieve fusion with his surroundings, rekindling a vitality lost by his separation from nature. This is what Ernest Suarez calls Dickey's "religion of natu- ralistic forces and of willed sensation" (52). Through it, the imagi- nation becomes a vehicle-not for constructing abstract concepts of a higher being, but for enhancing a connection with the im- minent world. Four poems from Dickey's work illustrate these principles: "The Lifeguard," "Approaching Prayer," "The Performance," and "The Heaven of Animals." Each poem represents a different stage in the struggle to integrate the self with the natural world. The personae of these poems, in the order in which I discuss them, move from failure to sublime fulfillment in their interaction with the cosmos. Together they form a representative sample of Dickey's naturalistic vision. 2 "The Lifeguard" depicts the failure of a romantic hero. The speaker of the poem is a lifeguard at a boys' camp who has lost one of his charges to the lake; the poem presents his thoughts in the aftermath of the drowning. The lifeguard's sense of guilt is overpowering, causing him to depart from the reality of his situa- tion into a desperate fantasy of recovering the dead child. Unable to accept the finality of the boy's death, he lapses into hallucina- tion. When he feels "the moon outside / Take on the utmost of its power," he fantasizes the Christ-like feat of walking on water: I set my broad sole upon silver, On the skin of the sky, on the moonlight, Stepping outward from earth onto water In quest of the miracle. (Poems 51) On the surface on the lake, the lifeguard is (at least in imagina- tion) in his own element, able to move above "the immovable</page><page sequence="4">90 Matthew Guinn blackness" that prevented him from finding the child earlier. His call to the child is answered as the drowned boy rises to meet him on the surface. For a moment, he seems to transcend the limits of the natural world, controlling the lake by the force of his will. But nature reasserts its power, thwarting the speaker's search for a miracle. The surface of the lake is ultimately a "surface of stone" which cannot be penetrated by the fantasy. By the end of the poem, the lifeguard begins to view the lake as a grave, the symbol of immutable past events: I wash the black mud from my hands. On a light given off by the grave I kneel in the quick of the moon At the heart of a distant forest And hold in my arms a child Of water, water, water. (Poems 52) The boy the lifeguard seeks now belongs to another element: he is a child "of water" only, his essence commuted to the lake which has claimed him. "The Lifeguard" is an important poem in Dickey's work be- cause it deals with the limitations of an individual faced with failure. As a poem about the death of a child-the most unjust of circumstances-it explores the indifference of nature within the context of a highly emotional narrative. The lifeguard's plaintive soliloquy is compelling because it contains a universal urge to reverse the past. As the poet has noted elsewhere, "He wishes to undo what has already been done. That's what we all want to be able to do, isn't it?" (Self-Interviews 103). But this poignant desire falls flat against the images of nature in the poem. The two domi- nant natural fixtures in the poem-the moon and the lake-re- main beautifully indifferent to the lifeguard's grief. As a pair of natural images, they underscore the lifeguard's solitude, the moon (like the lifeguard) above the water, the lake (with its child of water) below. They combine in the moon's reflection on the lake surface to emphasize the finality of that boundary through which the child has passed. The utmost of the moon's power does not support the miracle the speaker seeks, but only delineates a por- tion of the natural world he cannot control. The reflection is a beautiful and sublime image, but it is ultimately as implacable as</page><page sequence="5">South Atlantic Review 91 the "immovable blackness" beneath the lake. By accepting these limitations, the lifeguard succeeds in relin- quishing his fantasy and returning to the tangible world. While his hallucination has sustained him for a time, to cling to it would mean madness; he acknowledges this by recognizing that he holds only a child of "water, water, water"-effectually returning to the tangible. The repetition of the word connotes a sense of desper- ate sadness, but also an acceptance of what cannot be changed, of the child's irrefutable new essence. As Neal Bowers observes, the lifeguard abandons his "tactics [of] evasion and hallucination" for "an acceptance of the situation" (Bloom 124). He has failed as the idealized, romantic hero to a "village of children"-and failed in his Christ fantasy-but he may still be the "savior of one" to him- self. "Approaching Prayer" continues Dickey's theme of the primacy of the material world and the individual's efforts to transcend it. As the speaker attempts to effect some kind of transcendental communication, he finds himself continually returning to the tac- tile world. His prayer begins with the material, as he accumulates the possessions of his late father in totemic fashion. He circles through his father's house "Looking for things to put on / Or to strip myself of / So that I can fall to my knees / And produce a word I can't say / Until all my reason is slain" (Poems 163). It is important that Dickey has his speaker begin with material ob- jects in his search for a word (a transcendental signifier) that is never named, that remains elusive. All of the speaker's visions in the poem return him to that which is earthly and tangible: to the sweater, the spurs, and the boar's head. Transcendence, meaning, and ultimate communication are to be found only in the speaker's memories of the natural world of the boar hunt. The double narrative of the poem underscores this disparity between the celestial and terrestrial worlds. The italicized sec- tions which recount the boar hunt are composed of active and forceful language, while the roman-type verse paragraphs of the prayer remain tentative and uncertain throughout. The memory of the hunt appears to be more "real" than the prayer. As the material of immediate personal experience in nature, it possesses more transcendent value than kneeling in an attic. The prayer seems either to affect nothing ("The moon and the stars do not move") or to return to mundane perceptions ("The universe is</page><page sequence="6">92 Matthew Guinn creaking like boards"). The prayer culminates in a combined im- age of cosmic glory and human futility: Something goes through me Like an accident, a negligent glance, Like the explosion of a star Six billion light years off Whose light gives out Just as it goes through me. (Poems 166-67) After nearly lifting off the floor, the speaker gets up "In the way I usually do"-without having made any otherworldly connection. The prayer, or near-prayer, leaves the speaker, like the lifeguard, alone with himself. His father has not answered, the celestial Father has not answered; only the memory of the boar's blood coursing to the sea approaches a totalizing connection. The speaker comes to understand that the value of his prayer resides within himself and his attachment to the physical world. Hoping that "the irrelevancies one thinks of / When trying to pray / Are the prayer," the speaker says that he has "got by my own / Means to the hovering place" where the transcendental urge culminates in the tangible. The "hovering place" is earthly and vital, not celestial. It is not the place of prophetic declaration (Poems 168), but of imaginative and physical connections to na- ture. The experience returns the speaker to himself, from what is "not heard" to what is "somehow said." Having come up against the limits of human perception, the speaker relishes the vitality of the physical world, the naturalistic "feathery slaughter" of the spurs and the violent stillness of the hunter's kill. Like the life- guard, he is compelled to acknowledge the restraints of the physical world and fall back upon his own resources as a response. He is not faced with solipsism-the power of the imagination and na- ture guard against isolation-but with an existence with such limits as to refrain from calling the sun (like Blake) what it is not. Perhaps reason may be slain and overcome, but the limits of the physical world cannot. While the lifeguard is left with a child of water, the speaker of "Approaching Prayer" is left with himself, imagination, and memory. The attempts of both personae to tran- scend the physical world return them to the realm of tangible</page><page sequence="7">South Atlantic Review 93 experience. While each seeks a momentary ascendance over his environment, what is not heard (God, the drowned boy) points back to the material world. 3 "The Lifeguard" and "Approaching Prayer" demonstrate that the sovereignty of the natural world leaves Dickey's personae with limited responses; one is to perfect the role they are given. In "The Performance," Donald Armstrong accepts his circumstances and figuratively transcends his own execution by perfecting the handstand he attempts as an amateur acrobat. The movement of the poem centers on the refinement of Armstrong's acrobatics from awkward to perfect. His execution becomes secondary to this process. The events of the poem are reported without moral judgment, focusing not on Armstrong's circumstances, but what he made of them-how he "perfected his role" as an acrobat. By focusing on the acrobatic performance instead of the execution, the poem's title underscores the theme. What matters is how Armstrong reacted to his predicament; his victory lies in making his execution almost incidental to the perfect handstand. Initially, Armstrong struggles with his hobby. The speaker of the poem sees him "staggering oddly off into the sun" of the Phil- ippine Islands and notes "how well he was not / Standing there on his hands" (Poems 30). This awkward effort is startlingly juxta- posed with the feat of physical exertion Armstrong performs the next day as his head is toppled from his body. Although "the enemy's two-handed sword / Did not fall from anyone's hands / At that miraculous sight," the speaker imagines a different reac- tion. If Armstrong had been able to perfect his handstand, the speaker thinks, the headsman might have broken down "In a blaze of tears, in that light / Of the thin, long human frame / Upside down in its own strange joy." Armstrong could have risen "In kingly, round-shouldered attendance, / And then knelt down in himself / Beside his hacked, glittering grave, having done / All things in this life that he could." What is most original about this poem is its tone; it avoids all the conventional responses to the situation that the reader might expect. The speaker does not express outrage or indignation for the death of his friend-he refrains from questioning the moral</page><page sequence="8">94 Matthew Guinn order of the world. He seems to accept the executioners' roles as readily as Armstrong's, focusing on how well the roles are per- formed. Like the Yukon ofJack London's Call ofthe Wild, Dickey's Philippines are a naturalist environment presented without apol- ogy. The relative value of each individual is measured by how well he adapts to the harsh environment, whether he responds with stoic dignity to inevitable tragedy. Armstrong succeeds in this amoral setting. Unlike the lifeguard, he does not express re- gret (and indeed he has not failed in his role as the lifeguard has), but manages to preserve a sense of "kingly attendance" at his own execution. By kneeling down "in himself" at his penultimate moment, he becomes the apotheosis of self-knowledge. He is fully contained within himself and su- premely aware of his relationship to the physical world. He brings beauty to a brutal situation as he kneels beside the grave, which is now transformed by his feat into a paradoxically "hacked" and "beautiful" feature of the landscape. Because Armstrong has "done / All things in this life that he could," his premature death is not a tragedy. Rather, it provides the opportunity to react with stoic compliance to an inevitable fate. Armstrong does not attempt to transcend the physical world, but to refine his role within it. "The Heaven of Animals" provides the supreme example of Dickey's brand of naturalism. As a vision of an animal paradise, it is a fanciful poem, but it is still obedient to the irrefutable laws of nature. Dickey works to avoid an anthropocentric vision in the poem, depicting animals reveling in the amoral power of their own natures, in the absence of mankind. In Self-Interviews, he explains why this heaven must remain free of the romantic para- digms imposed by humans: "I wanted each beast to have his own identity: that is, the lion would not really be a lion if, as the Bible says, the lion lies down with the lamb" (108-9).2 For the poet, this paradise must be faithful to animal nature. It therefore includes predation and death, but the poem is not a celebration of violence, as some critics claim. Instead, it presents a landscape devoid of human presence, and consequently, of evil. The animals enjoy a sort of Darwinian Eden where immorality is replaced by the amorality of the natural cycle. The animal heaven is a place where creatures' instincts "wholly bloom," where each animal's role is perfected (Poems 1957-1967 59). The refinement of their interaction entails a higher level of</page><page sequence="9">South Atlantic Review 95 the predator/prey relationship, a relationship which is of neces- sity a component of the new paradise. The animal heaven would not be complete without its predators: For some of these, It could not be the place It is, without blood. These hunt, as they have done, But with claws and teeth grown perfect, More deadly than they can believe. (Poems 59) These animals are rewarded with consummate skill in their roles; as in the heaven of humans, they become more themselves in the afterlife. The kill becomes a joyful ritual. The predators' "descent / Upon the bright backs of their prey" is protracted ecstatically as they fulfill their role, the process lasting for "years" in a "sover- eign floating of joy." The prey must enact their part as well, but they enjoy the "reward" of "full knowledge / Of what is in glory above them" (Poems 60). The religious overtones of the word "glory" emphasize the immediacy of this paradise. Like Donald Armstrong, the animals act with "acceptance, compliance" as they perfect their roles at "the cycle's center." Together the hunters and hunted form a perfectly cyclical process which incorporates the natural world into a conventional paradigm of eternity. Their re- ward resembles Armstrong's because, like him, they have achieved full knowledge of their roles. Richard J. Calhoun and Robert W. Hill have commented on the thematic similarity between "The Heaven of Animals" and "The Performance." They note that both poems present a "depic- tion of stoic necessity relieved by an oddly unexpected joy, a curi- ous sense of ecstasy in the midst of sanctioned carnage" (44). This "stoic necessity" is one part of the naturalistic theme which Dickey stresses in the two poems: one must accept the universe on natu- ral terms, and work to the utmost of one's capacity within these limitations. There is a certain ecstasy in the process, and the car- nage of each poem only emphasizes the virtue of this stoicism in its strictest trial. But Calhoun and Hill misinterpret the natural- istic theme later in their essay:</page><page sequence="10">96 Matthew Guinn The poet's effort to make a heaven of (for?) animals is not nearly so democratic as it may at first appear. The pleasantest of all worlds is one in which the strong have willing (and trembling) prey; it is the fulfillment of the predator's sadistic desire for fear in his quarry that we see most of. (44) This passage is indicative of typical misreadings of Dickey's natu- ralistic poems. Calhoun and Hill approach the poem from an- thropocentric and humanistic paradigms, implying that a perfect heaven of animals would be democratic and "fair." But a truly naturalistic depiction mandates the hierarchy of predation which characterizes the natural world; Dickey's amoral presentation ac- quiesces to this rule. The predator's "sadistic desire for fear in his quarry" that Calhoun and Hill discern is an anthropocentric read- ing of the poem, the modifier "sadistic" being an example of pa- thetic fallacy which indicates a refusal to interpret the poem on its own terms. The kill becomes the central action of the poem because it best illustrates Dickey's point. It is not sadistic at all, but indifferent. As Dickey clearly implies, the animals are inca- pable of sadism; the kill is their part of an indifferent cycle. The "sovereign floating of joy" derives not from human immorality, but from the glorious amorality of the natural world and its vital- ity. The problematic aspects of Dickey's naturalism are clearly demonstrated in this excerpt from an otherwise fine essay; we find Calhoun (perhaps the most perceptive and sympathetic of Dickey's critics) describing the poem in terms similar to those Bly used to attack "The Firebombing." Once again, the naturalis- tic strain becomes a point of contention. Nelson Hathcock proposes a more balanced reading of "The Heaven of Animals." He sees it as "an oddly quiet poem even though the scene described could be characterized as one of Dar- winian ruthlessness" (Bloom 143). He discerns "a current of wist- ful envy and longing" in the poem's speaker, as if he "envies the power of tooth and claw-the elemental, instinctive act" (146). These comments approach a summary of Dickey's naturalistic vision on a larger scale. The animal heaven is "oddly quiet" be- cause it is perfection realized, analogous to the alignment of plan- ets that the persona of "Approaching Prayer" seeks but cannot attain. The speaker of "The Heaven of Animals" is envious of the</page><page sequence="11">South Atlantic Review 97 animals because he desires the connection they represent. Hathcock sees this desire as a universal impulse: "At one time or another we have all envied the terrible bliss of a heaven like the one described, a submission to naturalistic urges" (146). It is this "terrible bliss" which forms the catalyst of Dickey's naturalistic poems. The process of attaining it is the basis of all the poems discussed here, from the failure and limitations experienced by the lifeguard and the speaker of "Approaching Prayer," to the tran- scendent acceptance of Donald Armstrong and the animals. The animals have obtained what the human personae of the poems desire: a religion of the physical world which, to paraphrase Suarez, combines the forces of nature with the individual's will. This com- bination gives Dickey's romanticism a firm foundation in the per- ceived world, allowing his personae to create transcendence not from visionary fantasy, but from the human imagination and the materials of sovereign nature. 4 The naturalistic elements in Dickey's poetry allow him to ex- pand the parameters of American poetry by augmenting the tra- ditions of romanticism, Transcendentalism, and primitivism with a new interpretation of the American Adam. His is a new Ameri- can poetry. Yet while the naturalistic strain of our national char- acter is undeniable, Dickey's exploration of it has been costly to his reputation.3 Like the Naturalists who preceded him, he has been castigated for introducing an unsettling perspective into the country's literature, for producing writings which "lack a moral arbiter" (Suarez 42). Joyce Carol Oates describes the conundrum of being such a visionary: Who can tell us more about ourselves?--about our "American," "masculine," most dangerous selves? Even more than Whitman, Dickey contains multitudes; he cannot be reproached for the fact that some of these aspects of a vast, complex self are at war with the others. (Weigl and Hummer 66) Dickey's naturalistic sensibility is at the core of Oates's question, just as it is the seed of the controversy which has threatened to eclipse his poetic achievement. It is the naturalism in his poetry</page><page sequence="12">98 Matthew Guinn which causes him to occupy the space Oates assigns him: "a tragic dimension in which few poets indeed have operated." Oates asks, "Could Whitman's affirmation hold out if he were forced to af- firm not just the violence of others, but his own?" (Wiegl and Hummer 381). Poems such as "The Fiend," "Slave Quarters," and "The Firebombing" explore the "tragic dimension" by examining the dark side of American consciousness Whitman ignored. Dickey's naturalistic vision makes this perspective possible. In these po- ems, the amorality of "The Heaven of Animals" becomes human evil, the imposition of superior power and will on others. They reveal terrifying yet irrefutable facets of human nature. It soon becomes clear that the ex-pilot of "The Firebombing" enjoyed a "sovereign floating of joy" in his bomber which parallels that of Dickey's animal predators. His guilt over not feeling guilt is shock- ing because it strips away the veneer of civilization to reveal a natural man-and consequently, a drive for survival that entails indifference to the suffering of others. "The Fiend" and "Slave Quarters" continue the exploration of indifference, presenting not only the mentality of aggression, but the primitive satisfaction of assertion and domination. As Suarez has amply documented, such perspectives caused critics to charge Dickey with "sick fantasies" of male aggression (82). Yet these poems are true to an evolu- tionary perspective of humanity; they are the unpleasant corol- laries of the naturalism that makes regenerative poems like "The Heaven of Animals" possible. In condemning these poems, critics like Ralph J. Mills and Robert Bly refuse to accept the whole of Dickey's vision. While the American character produces coura- geous individuals like Donald Armstrong, its violence also per- mits fiends to flourish. Dickey chronicles both. Dickey's vision demands that the reader observe human beings in both incarnations, not with a view toward moralizing, but with an observer's curiosity for how the world shapes the individual. His naturalism requires the reader to acknowledge the primacy of the physical world, to consider that "volatile and violent qualities are an inherent and sometimes desirable part of the human con- dition, while the loss of aggressive, instinctual urges is a form of castration that cuts off access to the full realm of experience" (Suarez 42). The primitivism reclaimed by this naturalistic ap- proach facilitates a transcendent vision of connection, a means of</page><page sequence="13">South Atlantic Review 99 accessing "the full realm of experience" in all of its transformative power. Ultimately, what the reader takes from Dickey's poetry is a re-oriented view of the world, a perception of nature stripped of artifice and sentimentality. His combination of romanticism and naturalism creates this unprecedented perspective from which to perceive the world, a combined vantage point of animal experi- ence and human imagination. Like Dickey's most sublime cre- ation, the Sheep Child, the reader is given the opportunity to perceive the world from an impossible perspective. Through Dickey's poetry, the reader is allowed to view "the great grassy world from both sides"-both human and animal. The power of Dickey's vision makes us curiously sad that a creature like the Sheep Child cannot exist, that human perception and experience cannot be as broad as the imagination desires. Yet Dickey's work continues to hold forth the promise of an absolute if diminished connection to the world, a return to nature in its indifferent glory. University ofSouth Carolina NOTES SMy use of the term "naturalism" has certain limitations. I do not mean to imply that Dickey propounds the social determinism found in Theodore Dreiser's novels or Stephen Crane's Maggie. Rather, I suggest that Dickey interprets the natural world in much the same manner as Frank Norris or Jack London. In the context of Dickey's poetry, naturalism entails a conviction that nature is indifferent to the individual; that anthropocentric or idealized paradigms of the natural world are the product of romantic self-delusion, and thus an impedi- ment to self-discovery. 2 Dickey's comments in a later interview also illuminate the poem: "If you have been around animals very much, you know they don't have any humani- tarian sentiments about each other. Some of them have to kill others to sur- vive" (Baughman 97). ' Ernest Suarez's excellent study, James Dickey and the Politics of Canon: Assessing the Savage Ideal, explores this fall from critical grace, although his focus on literary politics does not include extensive attention to Dickey's natu- ralistic strain.
