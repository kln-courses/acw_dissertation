<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTIQUE ART: CONTINUITY AND TRANSFORMATION Beginning in the eighteenth century, classi cal archaeology and the historiography of ancient art, coupled with an idealizing aes thetic, developed as an interactive, compli mentary relationship largely because of Johann Joachim Winckelmann's enormous influence as a writer of superb German prose and as the first modern historian of Greek and Roman art. In his famous work Reflections on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture (1755), he stated his principal view of Greek classical art: "Sensual beauty provided the artist with all that nature could give; ideal beauty provided him with sublimity—from one he took the human element, from the other the divine."1 This belief irradiated his perception of Greek art as a normative standard through out antiquity and, equally, as an ennobling model for artists in his own time. Winckelmann's subsequent History of the Art of Antiquity (1764) in effect depended heavily on a particular fraction of ancient artistic production—Greek and Roman stone sculpture—whose evolution was articulated by stylistic criteria derived from reconstituted famous masters.2 Unfortunately, their oeuvre had been lost but for traces of their survival and supposed influence in ancient texts and Roman copies. Indeed, their reconstruction, however limited by insufficient physical evidence, demonstrated Winckelmann's genius as a connoisseur and served as a methodological model for subsequent gen erations of art historians specializing in Richard Brilliant antiquity, many of them still imprisoned in an eighteenth-century aesthetic. Winckelmann s criteria of aesthetic judgment were associated with periods of intense artistic activity that were tied to specific sites and local cultures politically and economically favorable to the generation of works of art—in particular, Athens and Pergamon. As a result, qualities of style, infused with contingent estimations of value, were placed on a sliding scale of relative worth, either rising to attain an acme of accomplishment in the classical age of the fifth and fourth centuries b.c.e. or falling into slow decline through the Hellenistic age into imperial Rome.3 Artworks that he attributed to the classical age became normative embodiments of the highest quality of artistic achievement. In different degrees and with some notable exceptions—for example, the Apollo Belvedere and the Laocoon—he tended to denigrate later products of Greek and Roman art as comparatively less noble but still worthy of critical attention because of their incorporation of traditional formal values, even in progressively attenuated form. His glorification of the artistry of the classical age was consistent with the views of Hellenistic critics, preserved in Pliny's Natural History, but his extended purview and modern perspective enlarged his more favorable estimation of post-fifth-century art. Yet, despite the authority of his unpre cedented narrative, Winckelmann's History manifested certain anomalies: he applied</page><page sequence="2">3 retrogressive standards of value, strongly idealized, as if postclassical continuity had to be discounted, especially because of the changed circumstances in which the creation of artworks occurred, evident in the broaden ing cultural base of Hellenistic society, which departed increasingly from the "pure Hellenic" character of the earlier polis. As noted, he also relied almost exclusively on works of sculpture, especially freestanding statues in marble, carved in the round. These statues, because they survived in vast num bers and were being actively collected in the West since the sixteenth century, constituted for him the solid core of ancient art, reliably representative of stylistic norms and devel opmental patterns.4 Perhaps he had no al ternative since artworks in other media did not survive in comparable abundance or had not yet been discovered. He did, of course, acknowledge the presence of great painters in antiquity, whose achievements and repu tation were recorded in the ancient texts. However, their paintings had perished, and present evidence of their replication was unavailable. In fact, the common body of ancient painting was invisible until it began to reappear in the transposed form of Roman wall decoration, revealed by the excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii, or as pictorial emblemata in Roman floor mosaics, like the Alexander Mosaic, now hung in the Naples National Archaeological Museum as if it were a wall painting. Furthermore, the eighteenth century considered painting, not sculpture, to be the highest level of visual art. According to Lessing, Diderot, and other contemporary art critics, painting was thought to empower the greatest expansion of the viewer's imagination. The very materiality of sculp ture effectively abridged those possibilities and sharply focused attention on sculptures, which shared space with the viewer. Winck elmann did make exceptions for the empa thetic power of some ancient masterpieces such as the Laocoon, whose own stylistic pedigree implicated Greek and Roman sources.5 Sculpture—especially freestanding marble sculpture—therefore, became the armature on which Winckelmann hung his conception of the historical development of ancient art through the centuries. However, most of these sculptures, especially statues, were to some degree substantially contaminated by physical deformation, site displacement, and variant modes of display so that they existed in a state of questionable authenticity, even if they retained their legitimacy as unclas sified works of ancient art. Winckelmann was too expert a connoisseur (usually) to be taken in by Renaissance works all'antica or by contemporary forgeries or pastiches made for the art market, responding to the increasing desire to collect and display antiquities. Still, he tended to look through the extant works of sculpture to which he had direct visual access in order to see the presumed Greek originals that he believed lay behind them as models and sources of their derivation.6 And on these hypothetical, Platonic shadows, he conceived of his History with such profound effect that his stylistic/chronological schemes and attribu tions retained their sway for more than two centuries. The success and authority of his History and other writings, including his extensive correspondence with like-minded savants, depend on the primacy of their entrance into the new field of art history, on the acuteness of his connoisseurship, and on his passionate dedication to a conception of the Greek ideal that reflected and trans cended nature.7 In this regard, Winckelmann may also have been influenced by Plato's</page><page sequence="3">4 critique of mimesis,8 although he maintained his admiration of the masterful, naturalistic creations attributed to Praxiteles and Lysippos, whose works had been so highly praised by Quintilian (Institutio Oratoria 12.10.9) in the first century C.e. Surely, Winckelmann's positive, often enthusiastic, response to their works and to the sculptures created by artists well after the fifth century b.c.e. indicates both the immediacy of his reaction to them and his willingness to set aside in their presence his addiction to fifth century-b.c.e. ideals. Winckelmann never went to Greece, never saw the great monuments of Athens in situ, and knew firsthand very few ancient Greek sculptural originals. Idealization of the ancient Greeks as paragons had long been challenged in the twentieth century because of its general lack of historical veracity. One may well query the broad legitimacy of his insights, when for him the Roman copies of alleged Greek "masterpieces" were trans parent and their generation in a changing context of replication, emulation, and cal culatingly prestigious display nearly irrele vant. Even the identification of "Greek masterpieces,"9 appraised through a series of Roman copies, exhibited an a priori text based reference to nobilia opera as a touchstone of Greek artistic endeavor. He seemed also to be almost indifferent to their subsequent participation in the formation of the classical tradition, itself a complex, postclassical creation of Alexandrian critics associated with the Great Library. They, too, like Winckelmann, looked to the past for the core values of their culture, held to be in jeopardy by intellectual dilution, creative fatigue, and social change. The Roman impulse to copy an admired work of older art, thereby possessing it, in essence expressed a positive cultural bias toward classical models as normative artistic standards. This practice also involved the creation of "original copies" in the manner of famous artists, which stood by themselves as artworks worthy of interest and acquisition.10 Such copies may not have been completely faithful to the presumed Greek original or master, especially when marble struts were used to stabilize the limbs of figures derived from bronze statues or when the size or orientation of the model was extensively modified. Adjusted copies can manifest a visual and/or iconographic connection with ancient models while in tacit competition with them as legitimate artworks of their own time. Respect for the past and the desire to possess replicas or versions of famous artworks were sufficient motivations in the Roman world to produce and display a great body of artworks in emulation of prestigious types of Greek sculpture, cloak them in Roman attitudes, and display them as overt signs of a shared, or successor, culture.11 The abundance of Roman copies of Greek works of sculpture, or the indirect reflection of such "originals" in emulative Roman versions, or adaptations on display—all offer strong evidence for the perennial role of the classical tradition that united the artistic cultures of Greece and Rome, just as posited by Winckelmann in the inclusive title of his History. The persistent classical tradition in the visual arts emphasized the role of human beings and the anthropomorphic gods in the world. In sum, they constituted a powerful repertory of highly conventionalized forms and motifs with an acknowledged recog nizable lineage. The Greek primacy of invention led to the rapid development and dissemination of compositional modes of representation, widely accepted in the</page><page sequence="4">5 ancient world as the means of envisioning common themes and beliefs: the imagery of the great gods and major political and military figures; personifications of abstract ideas as social entities; allegorical modes with rhetorical implications; mythological subjects with contemporary appropriative relevance; conceptions of the afterlife and its possibilities of prolonged existence; and the portraiture of the living who participated actively in the making of this world. This repertory was carried by the classical tradition and manifested itself particularly in periodic eclectic revivals, in classicizing episodes in late Hellenistic and Augustan art, in the dissemination of specific composi tional and figural types, and in the production of suitable copies or referential versions. The tradition itself, being so com prehensive and adaptable, was not static. It formed a creative continuum, marked by appropriation and transformative adaptation for centuries without losing the overall integration of its vivid imagery in a corpus of mutually coherent elements that remained discretely recognizable (Fig. I).12 In his attempt to make distinctions of style in the millennium-long run of ancient art, Winckelmann had established points of demarcation based on the (fictive) artistic persona of famous Greek sculptors. He drew on ancient texts to establish their identity as nodes of creative activity,13 supported by his somewhat tendentious visual analysis of apparent survivals, or echoes, in later deriva tions whose ultimate filiation he discerned. Claims of originating authorship, necessary to the exercise of connoisseurship, has been, since Winckelmann, a central feature of German classical art history well into the twentieth century. It seeks to identify the creative (Greek) artist responsible for an artwork and/or his personal style. This approach is surely consistent with general art-historical scholarship. But its results are more problematic in the study of ancient art because so much of ancient art—both originals and versions thereof—has been lost, thus weakening the force of attributions and the location of a body of works in space and time. Whether or not the determination of authorship is required for the deeper under standing of a work of art may be a contemporary Foucauldian issue; it cannot be in play when confronted with the uncer tainties of attribution encountered when dealing with ancient art. How fully realized can the signature of authorship be in a work of ancient art known only through emulative versions and copies, especially when they, in turn, have been deeply influenced by con temporary attitudes and artistic practices? The posited category of a "work by Phidias," established retrospectively by Winckelmann through the analysis of inauthentic replicas ("inauthentic" meaning not by the hand of Phidias or his workshop), is highly prob lematic. This heuristic category alone, how ever brilliantly conceived and self-con firming, falls short of providing the historical record with a solid foundation.14 Maybe Winckelmann's stylistic termi nology should be relegated to the role of historicizing rubrics, more factoids than facts, and should be met with some skepticism because his agendas and formulations are not ours. Perhaps the same reservations should be extended to the weak distinctions made between decontextualized examples of Greek and Roman sculpture, although dealers and collectors might disagree. Hellenistic artistic culture encompassed much of Roman figural art because it defined and promulgated</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 1 From Polykleitos, Lysippos, and Praxiteles to Diirer.

Doing so would also reaffirm Winckelmann's coherent treatment of Greek and Roman art as ancient art, a composite entity for which the old term Greco-Roman might once again be invoked.15 The continuous flow of innovative works of art within the classical tradition offers the present historian of ancient art an opportunity to analyze the processes of adaptation and transformation from the instrumental stage of early Hellenistic art to the consolidation of the classical tradition in late antiquity, a span of almost seven hundred years.
