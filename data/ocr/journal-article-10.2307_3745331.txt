'Have you any system of inference from mystic experience comparable to the system by which science develops a knowledge of the outside world?" asks Professor Eddington. Mr. Milburn has set himself the task of replying to that question. He wisely does not set himself the task of constructing such a logic. As well might the worm ask the butterfly if he has any system of burrowing comparable with his, and if not how he can possibly move ? Pascal never suggested a logic of his famous reasons of the heart. Yet to presume that logic, as we understand it, and science as we practise it, measure the real and the true between them, is as gross an anthropomorphism as ever was believed. The question is whether logic is not a question-begging term to use in connexion with religious certainty. Mr. Milburn holds that an objective science of spiritual truth is in process of formation, but as yet incomplete. His essay is a contribution to it. He faces a number of old problems from a fresh angle, but to pursue the hope of an objective science of what is person - ally demonstrated is as if the lover aimed at objective demonstration of the raptures of his love. Mr. Milburn is too fond of ugly and needless technical terms, "theoid " "subterpressed," "deconscioused," "prosopon," and transgresses in such as this: "Theoid experience is biologically functional in that it is a mechanism which the psyche has evolved as a means to its own health and well-being." Then, as if with a sense of his misdeeds, he adds in brackets, "It is God that works in evolution." Why not leave it at that? It would be unfair to stress such blemishes, however, and detract from the fact that Mr. Milburn makes a useful contribution to an important matter; and if a science of values is likely to prove a dream, he at least has helped to treat some religious values in a scientific manner. Dr. Hodgson uses the term philosophy in a popular rather than a strict sense, for he does not offer any systematic exposition of Christian philosophical implications, but gives some miscellaneous and very readable essays on all sorts of topics, from original sin to birth control. His standpoint is that of a liberal-minded member of the Anglican communion, and if we may take him as representing the American branch of that Church, we may be glad it is w well represented. Naturally, most readers will wish to cross swords at times with a writer who discusses such controversial matters, but Dr. Hodson is a partisan who has the happy art of saying provocative things in an un- provocative way, and keeps our sympathy even when he does not carry our judgment, 647</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES Dr. Foston writes a philosophical justification of the doctrine of the Trinity, for which championship he would certainly have been anathematized and ex- communicated, if not burnt, five hundred years ago. It is enough to say that his analogies are on the line of Form, Force, and Value, and the tripartite division of consciousness, intellect, will, and feeling. Dr. Foston reveals competent powers of thought, and while the force of his parallels will not appeal to all, he has said a number of things which may help to show that the Trinity is not altogether the product of obsolete Greek metaphysics, as some hastily assume is now evident. Dr. McConnell is eighty-five, and finds the time approaching when the last qu es- tion that concerns us is getting more than ever of interest?"If a man die, shall he live again ?" The title of the book gives its conclusion. Man is "immortable" rather than immortal. He is capable of, rather than possessed with, an im? mortal nature. The author makes a very readable book out of his speculations, with excursions into varied fields. Some statements, one wishes to question. For example, is it right to speak of any "instinct" of direction, either in Red Indians or in pigeons ? The latest investigators do not support any such view. Or again, it is certainly quite untrue to say that "measured by psychic standards, the interval between the lowest man and the highest man is a hundredfold greater than that between the lowest man and the highest brute." This is nonsense. Still more so is it to say we are far more closely related spiritually than physically to the brutes, and to add that if a certain action "involving thought" were described, it could not be told whether the actors were men or beasts. Since when has it been needful to postulate thought to explain the actions of the animals ? Is ether a "substance," and in what sense has it been "weighed and measured" ? Again, is it fair to lump hypnotism and telepathy with Spiritism and Occultism as "unsavoury" and "contaminated by fraud, charlatanry, credulity, and hysterics?" " 'Here instinct ends and reason begins,' is something none can say," remarks the author. That is correct, but is the presumption that at any stage instinct "ends"? The latter part of the book is theological, and here Dr. McConnell is much more at home than in the biological and psychological parts, where he depends on the opinions of others. It has the merit also of being definite and clear, a characteristic which could be copied with advantage by many theologians. Dr. Coffin has a lively imagination and an unconventional style. He discusses the soul of John Doe, in its origin and destiny, introduces us to Alien the agnostic, Harbin the materialist, Harriett Wilson fundamentalist, Young a modernist, and other creatures of his free fancy, who are lightly and amusingly sketched, and serve as Hume's dummies, or even Plato's, served, to put the shadow of flesh and blood on typical opinions, an acknowledgment of the fact that views really get their point from personalities, not from verbal expression. Dr. Coffin is undogmatic, his sympathies are never too obtrusive, and he succeeds in giving food for thought, without dyspepsia or disgust. Mr. Simpson's book contains the Terry lectures he gave at Yale, and in them he well represented the best traditions of Scottish theology. The first lecture is an able digest of modern cosmological speculation and discovery. The second similarly invades the sphere of anthropology. The last applies these findings to theological issues of man, God, and the universe. It is a timely and needful piece of work, for which many readers will be grateful. The whole shows much skill in dealing in so small a space with a topic on which so much more space has often been occupied with much less relevance. Mr. Joad is a prolific writer, who expresses his various views with trenchancy. Some will agree, more will differ as they read this book. But this classification is not exhaustive. There is a third group, to which I confess I belong, and to 648</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS which I think Mr. Joad himself belongs?those who do not understand Mr. Joad! Not because he is obscure, far from it, but because Mr. Joad really has not made up his mind what religion is, which is a pity in a prophecy about it. Sometimes one thinks Mr. Joad identifies religion with early Victorian orthodoxy in the manner of writers of "sensational" articles in the Press. He still lives with the "Science versus religion" outlook as it was in Huxley's day. He actually says the Church would ban scientific experiment and discovery, if it had the power. He tells us that "science" will probably "deliver the coup de grace to organized Christianity within the next hundred years." I have too good an opinion of Mr. Joad's abilities to take all this sort of stuff (and there is much more of it) too seriously. That is why I join the third party. Does Mr. Joad believe this, or is he merely providing good copy? In the appreciation of mysticism, however, it is possible to take him more seriously, though if Mr. Joad thinks that an emaciated creed such as he personally would acknowledge is to be the religion of the future, it does not reveal a great under? standing of the requisites of religion as it has always been for the vast mass of mankind. It is strange that no special qualifications seem to be needed for writing a book on religion. Certainly not any active connexion with any Church, nor a degree in divinity, nor even evidence of psychological, anthropological, or historical study of the forms of religious experience. On this topic knowledge seems to come by birthright, and to have qualification in any sphere is to be qualified here. Those who write on the present and future of the Labour Party, or Fascism, or psychical research, or medicine, are usually connected closely with the subject, or at least have given years of study to it. Religion and the weather are topics on which all men are expert. This may explain why one takes forecasts on both these subjects with polite scepticism. One does not think Mr. Joad is likely to be a true prophet, but one is glad that the eternal fascination of religion has at least made him "also among the prophets." E. S.
