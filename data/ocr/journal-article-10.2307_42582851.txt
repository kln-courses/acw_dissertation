Übers.: Kritik der dialektischen Vernunft , Band 1: Theorie der gesellschaftlichen Praxis. Reinbek (Rowohlt) 1967. 877 S. Sartre's concern with the relationship between the individual and the social collectivity is a concern which is a pervasive phenomenon of twen- tieth century thought and practice. Whereas Sartre has hitherto been the arch -defender of a humanistic individualism, he has become in his Cri- tique de la raison dialectique , a defender of historicism, historical deter- minism, and collective necessitarianism. Although he himself would deny the last characterization, I believe that it can be shown, in terms of his own analysis of the dynamics of social organization, that such is indeed his present position. The contingency which he had proclaimed in human existence, in history, has been abandoned for a , critical dialectic4 which has many of the features he denounces in the Marxist , dogmatic dialectic'. That this is the case, that Sartre tends to negate the very conclusions he ostensibly intends to defend in his Critique , will be the central argument of this paper.</page><page sequence="2">Necessity versus freedom in social processes (J. -P. Sartre) 95 The primary distinction which underlies his revision of Marxism is the distinction between a dogmatic dialectic and a critical dialectic. Sartre is fundamentally opposed to the Marxist view that there is an impersonal, »natural4 dialectical process which is independent of human action and thought. The assumption of a dialectic in nature is clearly a metaphysical hypothesis which is not logically entailed by a materialistic standpoint. One may admit that all material processes (with the exception of micro - physical phenomena) are subject to natural uniformity or universal deter- minism. Presumably, Sartre would hold that man ( qua en- soi or ,body') is subject to the universal physical laws that apply to all natural beings. However, since human consciousness, as Sartre conceives of it, is not an object, man is, in this sense, capable of free choice and freedom of action. The externalization of this mode of freedom is praxis. But in human practice or action the critical dialectic is manifested; that is, human history and actions are characterized by a complex process of reciprocal interactions between individual and individual, man and the material field, the individual and the group. Although man is surely subject to the material conditions of life at a particular stage of historical development, he is not merely passively molded by a dialectical process over which he has no control. If this were the case, history would be subservient to natural processes entirely. Hence, it would be, strictly speaking, inaccurate to talk about human history. The dogmatic dialectic ( dialectique dog- matique) makes a knowledge -claim which is empirically unwarranted since the relationship between material processes (again with exception of microphysical phenomena) ca be adequately explained in terms of causal laws. To put this in analytical terms, one may ask, what does the concept of dialectic add to our understanding of nature? A mechanistic account of chemical processes, for example, can wholly do without any reference to a dialectical process. When individuals like Jean-Pierre Vigier argue that because we hold that the motion of material processes exists independent of the observer we must admit that such motion can only be analyzed dialectically 1, he is guilty of ignoratio elenchi. No physicist would feel compelled to reach such a conclusion. What must be admitted about all of the arguments which attempt to demonstrate that there is a dialectical process in nature (including Engels' heroic attempt) is that they have failed. Only by assuming what is to be proved can such arguments be sustained. Although I would hold that such a way of interpreting natural processes is plausible, it is clear that the assertion that there is a natural 1 Jean-Pierre Vigier: Dialectics and Natural Science ? in G. Novack , ed., Existential- ism versus Marxism , New York, 1966, p. 247.</page><page sequence="3">96 George J. Stack dialectic dogmatic since it has not been shown to be apodictically certain. Only by reducing dialectic to a synonym for »movement' (as Vigier repeatedly does) can one maintain that there is a dialectic in nature. Nevertheless, Sartre argues that the concept of dialectic has significance only in relation to human experience or action. Although material objects or processes are encountered in their , brute' facticity in a practical field of instrumentalities, they are in relation to human consciousness since they are intentional objects of consciousness. This is not to say, of course, that material objects are »created' (in the fashion of idealism) by consciousness; rather, such objects are already there, are , given'. But, as in Husserl's phenomenology, such entities are noemata , phenomena for consciousness. Or, again in Husserl's terms, the meaning of such phenomena is not given, but is discovered by human consciousness, is , wrested' from phenomena. The act of relating a diverse multiplicity of phenomenologically distinct relata already indicates an intentional act of consciousness. Thus, the totality we describe as a , factory' has no natural reality or existence. It is man who gives meaning to this particular complex set of phenomena, and it is human praxis which brings the factory, as factory, into being. While attacking the metaphysics of dialectical materialism Sartre proclaims that the „only practical and dialectical reality, the mover of everything, is individual action " 2 . Putting aside the hyperbolic expression „the mover of everything", we can under- stand that Sartre is maintaining that the dynamics of social relations, the social actions of men, are manifested in an intelligible dialectical process. Social reality is a complex, indefinite multiplicity of reciprocities 3. Social phenomena cannot be under- stood, as Durkheim claimed, in terms of relationships amongst things. Social facts are not things, not inert objects, or purely natural phenomena. Human experience is itself dialectical. That is, it is characterized by action and reaction of social forces4, individual and collective. A purely analytical approach to social phenomena (one which would hold that such phenomena are subject to a quantitative logical formula- tion) only discovers the quantitative aspect of such phenomena and imposes a form of mechanism on social processes. The emotive, conative aspects of human experience are bracketed in order to achieve a purity of analysis. But, in this process, what is significant for the individuals in a social situation or process s left out. The quantitative analysis may be, in general and in abstracto , accurate, but the meaning of social experience is lost sight of, as well as the intentions of individuals, and the subjective nisus of action. Social phenomena should be described phenomenologically in order to avoid converting social relations into an ordre mechanique and in order to preserve the complex reciprocities of such relations4.

Sartre) 97 dialectical nature of social processes, Sartre argues, is possible because man experiences, in immediacy, this „living logic of action." What Sartre is saying is that we cannot assume that there is a dialectic in nature because, as far as we know, such a dialectic is present only to man and is characteristic of human experience alone. To assert a dialectics of nature is an anthropomorphic projection. The dialectic is present to man insofar as it is the means by which he experiences himself as a social being, by which his capacity for praxis is made actual. Whereas Plato's model for the concept of dialectic was dialogue and Hegel's model was thought, Sartre conceives of dialectic on the model of human action. A dialectic is manifested in and through the totalizing activity of man. Totalization refers to the process by which parts are synthesized into wholes or rational totalities. Social totalities are the basis of all other totalities. The intentional, totalizing activity of individuals within the dialectic of experience tends towards praxis or action. Society as such is a totality-in-process, a phenomenon which, as it were, is , produced' by the multiplicity of practical relationships with others who are engaged in the totalization of their singular experiences. Totalization is an intentional synthetic act of consciousness directed towards (actual or possible) action, a process which takes place within and amidst the totalities which are objects of reflective awareness. My reflective awareness of being within a totality -in -process (a society) is specified by the recognition of my existence within a subsidiary totality (e.g., a factory, a university, etc.). My dialectical experience within the totalizing movement or process of which I myself am a part entails my being a , moment4 in the complex totalization in process. And the multiplicity of totalizing activities is itself the dialectic of which the individual is already a ,parť or moment. Sartre emphasizes praxis as the characteristic expression of the dialectic of experience because (a) he adopts Marx's assumption that the material conditions of life determine social relations and (b) because of his commit- ment - already expressed in Être et le Néant - to the view that faire or , doing is one of the „cardinal categories of human reality". There is a prolepsis of his pragmatic concern in the Critique in his earlier ontological description. Thus, he remarked that to act is to modify the shape of the world; it is to arrange means in view of an end; it is to produce an organized instrumental complex such that by a series of concatenations and connections the modification effected on one of the links causes modifications throughout the whole series and finally produces an anticipated result5. Man's immediate relationship to the material field (champ matériel) is revealed in human work, in the original praxis by which he produces and reproduces his life. 5 Jean-Paul Sartre , Being and Nothingness ? (New York, 1956), p. 433. 7 Philosophische Rundschau 17. Heft 1-2</page><page sequence="5">98 George J. Stack The practical or material field which man encounters is already given, already constituted (déjà-constitué). Ultimately, all human action is dominated by scarcity. On this point Sartre vacillates. On the ohne hand, he seems to hold that material scarcity is the motive factor in all human praxis and hence in history. On the other hand, he often refers to need ( besoin ) as the basic motivating factor in social action6. Scarcity itself, however, is not a necessary condition for human action; in fact, it may be a condition which precludes action (thus, to cite only one instance, the scarcity from which India suffers has produced not social action, but passivity). In the United States, for example, the most violent attacks against social injustice are being initiated by Negroes who are not, strictly speaking, suffering from extreme material scarcity. Although the causal question is complex in this regard, it is clear that Black Americans are reacting violently against what they hold to be a socio-economic system which does not fulfill their social or psycho- logical needs. When Sartre claims that scarcity (rareté) is the ultimate causal factor which dominates praxis he seems to believe that he is propounding a Marxist view. Adam Schaff undermines this claim by pointing out that The Marxist conception of exploitation and surplus value is based on the fact that the worker produces more than the minimum amount required for his own satisfaction according to his historically determined living standards 7. Sartre's assertion that human history develops in „the permanent frame- work of a field of tension engendered by scarcity" is simply false. Those who are entirely impoverished, who suffer most severely from scarcity, are incapable of initiating revolt or rebellion. In the American revolution, the English revolution of 1648, and the Russian revolution the individuals most affected by material scarcity were not those whose praxis (in the broadest sense of the word) brought about these revolutions8. It is not the „absence of matter" or material goods which is significant in social action; rather, it is the selfconscious recognition of a need or a right which is the teleological factor in all significant social movements. Those who suffer injustice must become subjectively aware of this injustice, must become self-consciously aware that they have a right to demand the satisfaction of their social needs. Hence, we may say that Sartre's conception of need as the basic stimulus to social action is far more accurate than his general- ization that all praxis is caused by material deprivation or scarcity. 6 Jean-Paul Sartre , Critique de la raison dialectique , p. 206. 7 Adam Schaff , A Philosophy of Man.

Sartre ) 99 Granting the underlying basis of social activity in the , negative' condi- tion of need, it is clear that conflict is inevitable since there is a struggle against the physical world and a direct or indirect struggle against others. For, it is through need that there is totalization of a material field and others as well. In relation to a material field of practical instrumentalities there is a reciprocal interaction between human praxis and matter. When individuals or grous act upon their needs (which are translated into tele- ological projects), the material milieu is conditioned by this action; on the other hand, the material field conditions (or limits) the range of human action. The appropriation of a material or practical field of objects by man involves the humanization of matter. There is a dialectical circularity ( circularité dialectique ) here which involves the individual in a reciprocal conditioning process. There is an interaction, then, between the material world (matter-in-itself or, using Sartre's earlier terminology, the en-soi) and the human world, the two modalities of being which, for Sartre, comprise , reality'. Material entities which are employed as instrumentalities for the attainment of projects become humanized in the process and matter-in-itself is converted into matière ouvrée (matter worked upon by man). Sartre does not insist, as Marx did, that material instrumentalities are alienated from man (or the , worker4) because he is committed to the view that there is a primordial alienation (whiá is only aggravated by exploitation) in being itself. That is, the opposition between the pour-soi (being-for-itself) and the en-soi (being- in-itself), the radical alterity of consciousness and matter. It is for this reason that he cannot, strictly speaking, consistently hold the Marxist optimism of a perfect world when material scarcity and class conflict are forever removed from the face of the earth. The source of human alienation for him ultimately is grounded in his ontological dualism. Nevertheless, this concrete relationship between man and a totalized material field provides the material conditions for the totalization of men into specific groups. The basic social condition for the emergence of groups is the recognition of a common need and the alterity of others (e. g., the non-group or other groups). For Sartre, the most primitive and immediate relationship between man and man is one of hostility or conflict. The atomic individual experiences alienation in the face of the otherness of others. This ontological alienation (which is an aspect of a larger ontological condition) is aggravated by the worker's alienation from the product of his labor. Following Marx, he claims that the tools the worker uses, the objects produced, become inert forces conditioning his own existence. The products of his own praxis now ,acts upon4 him, affecting his own concrete situation. Because of is his rigid adherence to Marx's dogmatic description of alienated labor (which is clearly historically bound and no longer uni- versally applicable) Sartre fails to recognize that many of the commodities produced by workers provide fort their freedom as well as, in some cases, their slavery. It is a myth to claim today (in reference to many Western countries) that the products the worker produces are alien inert forces which act upon him and limit his freedom. For, the fantastic productive 7 *</page><page sequence="7">100 George J. Stack capacity possible through automation, improved equipment, and produc- tion control has granted the , worker4 a freedom he has never had in the past. The relation between the , worker' and what he produces in an automated system is so disproportionate (in terms of expenditure of energy or labor time and productive capacity) that Marx's conception of the worker's alienation is no longer universally applicable. The alienation pervading many Western nations is no longer a strictly economic conse- quent; rather it is a social, political, or psychological alienation. Since social relations, for Sartre, are generally characterized as basically hostile, a significant concern or interest must be present in order for cooperation to come about. Indeed, the basic source of social unification is interest, an interest which is, in its immediate form, a relationship between an individual and an object in a social field9. This basic pragmatic interest is paralleled in Heidegger's analysis of man's practical concern (Sorge) for things at hand. A common concern or interest in an object brings about the totalizing activity on the part of the members of this group -in- formation. A need joined with a common interest provides an individual with a goal or purpose he shares with others. This finality (even if it is obscure) is the teleological factor which unifies individual, atomic interests. The free praxis of individuals transforms the material field and therefore the social relations between individuals. As part of a loosely structured group -in -fusion (a seriality) the individual is now conditioned by this social totality. The reciprocal conditioning of material field and the individual is duplicated in the reciprocal conditioning process by which the emergent seriality (sérialité) is affected by the social relationships now prevailing. In man's concern with an entity in the practical field lies the basis for the formation of proto -groups. But in this gradual process man's activity already rebounds against man himself. The free praxis of individuals acting in terms of their concern has produced a seriality which, to some extent, conditions the individual's existence. Although a social seriality is, in one sense, a mere juxtaposition of individuals, it, never- theless, contains the seeds of a group. The random multiplicity of serialities is such as to tend towards disso- lution. It comprises what Sartre calls an escaping unity ( unité fuyante). As Sartre has described such loosely structured social relations, they can be thought of as contingent social structures. However, in his account of the transition from seriality to group -in -fusion (groupe en fusion) to group he tends to introduce the concept of necessity. When the tenuous unity of a seriality lacks a significant synthetic objective, a concern with 9 Jean Paul Sartre , op. cit., p. 261.</page><page sequence="8">Necessity versus freedom in social processes (J. -P. Sartre) 101 a dominant ,idea4, the atomicity of the individual is still present. But if there is an initiation of direct action, then , contagious reactions4 appear and the conditions for the possibility of group -formation arise. The group - in-fusion comes into being through an interest in a synthetic objective by which the , epicenters4 of individual choice and resolution transform the passive plurality of individuals into a unified group. A shared teleology or finality has provided the basis for concerted action. The aim of collec- tive praxis is the dépassement , the , transcendence4, of the undesirable existing situation. As Sartre describes the shift from individual praxis to common praxis he seems to understand it in terms of Hegel's concept of aufgehoben 10. That is, the transition from seriality to group involves the synthesis of individual and collective practice. Hence, the free praxis of the individual is ostensibly preserved4 and , destroyed4 in the new social synthesis. The question is, in what sense does Sartre preserve free, indi- vidual practice in his phenomenology of group formations? In order to answer this question, we must trace the process of group development further. A group-in-fusion is further unified if it encounters another social unity which totalizes it. Thus, for example, the mine owners in Pennsylvania (at the turn of the century in the United States) totalized the mine workers insofar as they recognized their opposition to themselves. This recognition on the part of the mine owners provided the mine workers with a stronger sense of their own group identity. The member of the group-in-fusion, through the recognition of the totalizing activity of the non- group (or other group), now becomes aware of a common danger, a common opponent, a synthetic object. Hence, the individual, as mediator (between his own group and the other group), totalizes and makes determinate his own group and solidifies the unity of this group. The members of the group are now unified by a common praxis and a common need ( exigence commune). In his account of this process of reciprocal totalizing activity on the part of groups Sartre seems to rely upon the Hegelian notion that self- consciousness arises in relation to the recognition of another self- consciousness u. Thus, the recognition of one group by the other generates a sense of opposition which brings about a heightened self -consciousness of group membership on the part of the individuals members of the group. The group becomes, then, a unified multiplicity ( multiplicité unifiée) capable of organized practice. The group is no longer only a intentional object (totality) for the individual who is a part of it; rather, the individual is now subservient to the intentionality, the ™ Ibid., p. 398. 11 Phänomenologie des Geistes , in: Sämtliche Werke.

The self-conscious recognition on the part of the individual member of a group of the common purpose of the group leads him to synthesize the group as totality. This emergent unifying inner orientation within a group is (contrary to the views of Lewin and Moreno) conceived of by Sartre as intelligible. The inner synthetic act of unifying a group is a response to the externally imposed totality of others (alien groups) as well as the individual member's determination of its unity in terms of commonly shared purposes, aims, or goals. This dual determination of a group is a necessary condition for the existence of a group. The transition to group formation is not described by Sartre as neces- sary nor is it ostensibly a mechanistic process. Supposedly, the freedom and contingency of individual choice and action is preserved throughout the entire process. The dynamic, renewed participation of individuals in social action seems to require choice, resolution, and decision. In one sense, to be sure, man's action is conditioned by social facts ; but, in another sense, he is a conditioning agent who can, to some extent, shape the direction of social action or social movements. There is a reciprocal, dialectical interrelationship among the individual, the social unit to which he belongs, and the practical or material field. A change in any one of these relevant social factors brings about a change in the others. Although admitting a host of causal factors affecting human action (and apparently abandorung his conception of human freedom as absolute) Sartre seems to intend to preserve the contingency of event, of human action and exitence and the freedom of the individual. It will become clear that his description ob being -in -a- group precludes the contingency and freedom he apparently desires to retain. In a group the individual, through a relation of mediated reciprocity (réciprocité mediée)12, benefits from the activity of others. As a member of a group the individual's action emerges in relation to a common power directed toward a common objective. Although the actualization of the power of the group is possible because of the free practice of individuals, their practice is itself determined as „an ephemeral mediation between the common power and the common objective" 1S. Individual practice is a , mediation4 because it is suppressed in order to serve a common end (fin commune). There is a certain tension between individual action and the organized practice of the group, a tension which is resolved by the direct action of the group on the individual. The group, as it were, must protect itself against the individual's tendency to project his action beyond the common end of the group as such. Since groups are characterized by contradictory tensions which threaten dissolution, stringent measures must be taken in order to insure group integrity. i* Ibid., p. 459. 13 Ibid., p. 470.</page><page sequence="10">Necessity versus freedom in social processes (J. -P. Sartre) 1Q3 One of the ways in which the internal contradictory tensions in a group is overcome is by means of the indirect coercive power of a dominant ,idea' Although the concern or interest of a group is overtly expressed in action, the unity of the group is at least supported by implicit reflective understanding of the shared ,idea' which the group imposes upon itself or implicitly accepts. This dominant idea functions as an interior norm (norme intérieure )9 a unifying conception which creates a common bond between members of a group, an implicit group purpose or self-image which cannot be entirely shared by those outside the group. This, in effect, is the ethos of a group, the consciously or unconsciously shared attitudes, feelings, and beliefs which provide for social unification. The mutually accepted ,ideac (or ideal) serves the function of a centripetal social force which tends to produce a consensus and concord of interacting individuals which mitigates their discords, separations, and disharmonious relations. Such common, often unstated, convictions provide a basis for a cohesive organization and are often symbolically reinforced by ritual, initiation, ceremony, or a pledge of fidelity or loyalty by means of an oath. As long as an individual remains a loyal member of such a group he is, as it were, committed to this ethos by virtue of tacit social consent. To undermine this ethos is, from the point of view of the group as a whole, to be disloyal, rebellious, to be a threat to the coherent unity of the group. The shared ,idea' or ideal (which provides the basis for an ethos) is a coercive psychological pressure which may not have any overt, concrete manifestation even though it may be sustained by means of symbols, rites, or oaths. In order to preserve the integrity of the group restrictions must be placed upon individual members. The internal danger of disintegration is countered by the demand for allegiance to the group in the form of an oath. The oath binds the individual to the group and establishes the basis for the imposition of , terror'. The term terreur is used by Sartre in the broadest sense to refer to the threat of expulsion, ostracism, or physical punishment. The common oath ( serment commun ) commits the individual to an agreement that he shall suffer some penalty if his actions threaten the dissolution of the group. Through the serment the group gives itself an ontological status which diminishes the danger of excessive differen- tiation or dissent. This submission of the individual to the group clearly marks a transition from an emphasis upon individual praxis to an emphasis upon the coercive power of the group (le caractère coercitif du groupe). What had been described as the „alienating reality of the Other" in Être et le néant is now given a sociological expression insofar as the individual member of a group exists in a relation of alterity to the group as a whole - the group is now conceived of as the nihilating Other. The individual is appropriated by the group, ist determined by his function (not his individual value as a human being), and is wholly subject to the absolute sovereignty of the group. An individual freedom is exchanged</page><page sequence="11">J 04 George J. Stack for a common freedom. Individual power is sacrificed for collective power. Sartre's description of the groupe en contrainte as a social unity in which there is a materialization of terror ( une matérialisation de la Terreur ) in the form of instruments of restraint makes us sceptical about the preser- vation of individual liberty and rights within such a group. Although one may be said to be free to become a member of a group (as Sartre has described it), it is clear that this will be the last free act of the individual. The insistence upon the necessity of terror or the threat of terror in group unification suggests a cynicism about man which one can find in Machia - velli's II Principe and Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan. The transition from individual being to being -in -a- group seems to entail the emergence of necessity in Sartre's account of social relations. He seems to suggest that as long as scarcity ( rareté ) exists there will be conflict between groups or classes. In addition, he also seems to be committed to a dogmatic Marxist view (exemplified by Nicholai Lenin) that the importance of a common goal or end justifies the complete sacrifice of the individual, the conversion of the individual into an instrument of a collectivity. What is ironic about this is that Sartre is embracing views which Marxist revisionists (such as Leszek Kolakowski) have only recently attacked. Kolakowski has attacked the „historiosophical vision" which assumes that the individual must be subordinate to the „messianic hope" of communism which becomes the only law of life and which demands the total sacrifice of the individual in order to bring about a futuristic „new era" 14. In general, it may be said that Sartre, in his Critique, seems to main- tain that the absorption of the individual by the group is ineluctable and necessary if an effective social unit is to come into being. It is difficult to believe that the group, as Sartre has described it, could be one in which the individual is able to manipulate the group in the interest of his own security15. The transformation of the individual into the common indi- vidual (individual subject to the group) entails that the individual be now entirely defined in terms of his function (la fonction est une définition positive de V individu commun). But surely a man defined by his function is an object (not, as Sartre would have us believe, a subject), a mere instrument which must serve the interest of the sovereign group. Although the group originally was constituted by the individual, it is clear that once the necessary conditions for group stabilization occur the group constitutes the individual. The group as totality is free to use the individual as a tool or instrument in terms of its goals or purposes. Although indi- 14 Leszek Kolakowski , Responsibility and History.

Sartre) 105 vidual, free praxis is said to be the necessary condition for group action, the organized practice ( praxis organisée ) of the group appropriates (in Sartre's Hegelian terminology, negates) individual action. Sartre's pheno- menology of group dynamics negates his ostensible defense of the rights of the individual, of individual freedom. Once the transition to group unification occurs, it is obvious, in Sartre's account, that the , mover of everything' is no longer individual action, but organized, group action. Sartre charged that the dogmatic Marxists had made man subservient to natural and historical forces over which he had no control. But one can say that Sartre has now made the individual subservient to a necessary sequence of social processes over which he has no control. If the dialectic of group formation is necessary (as Sartre seems to hold), then the contin- gency requisite for individual freedon is no longer present or possible. Sartre's conception of the social dialectic undermines his desire to preserve human freedom. Thus, for different reasons, his theory of a social dialectic resembles, mutatis mutandis , the dogmatic dialectic he intended to attack. The development of the Critique de la raison is a process of the unveiling of necessity, not a defence of human freedom in terms of a revised Marxism. Sartre distinguishes his conception of dialectic from Hegel's by insisting that his conception of dialectic is concrete and immanent in phenomena or being and is not, like that of Hegel, a thought process. A dialectic of spirit (Geist) is replaced by a dialectical process of becoming which is , present4 in human experience. Despite Sartre's dissociation from Hegel, the Critique is, in many respects, pervaded by Hegelian concepts and ultimately introduces necessity into social -historical phenomena in much the same way Hegel did. Although Sartre differs with Hegel in terms of the nature and teleology of the dialectical process (he denies, for example, that all dialectical movement culminates in an absolute that lies beyond individual consciousness) 16, he seems, malgré lui , to introduce necessity into a process which he originally attempted to designate as contingent. Once group formations emerge necessity is the determining factor affecting the , singular adventure4 of the individual. For, Sartre argues that through group membership an individual is affected by the inertia of the group and is converted into an inorganic being (être inorganique). The common individual (the individual subject to the coercive power of the group) is described as the foundation of individual praxis11 . Now, if the common 16 Arthur Lessing , Marxist Existentialism. Review of Metaphysics, XX (1967), p. 475. 17 Jean-Paul Sartre , op. cit., p. 494.</page><page sequence="13">106 George J. Stack individual is transformed into an inorganic being subject to the inertia of the group, and if being-in-a-group limits individual practice, we can no longer speak of free, individual practice at all. One of the diachronic or durational characteristics of groups is their tendency toward inertia through rigidity, intolerance of internal antagonism and dissent, petrification4, and inflexibility. Once this happens to a group an innovator, reformer, or revisionist is seen as „other, stranger, suspect" 18. One of the paradoxes of Sartre's theory of social dynamics is that although the group is formed ostensibly to satisfy the needs of individuals, it becomes clear that the group ends by negating the individual as such. In this entire process by which the individual's free praxis becomes appropriated by the group there are a series of necessary stages or , moments'. Thus, fo example, he describes dialectical processes as inevitable, proceeding from step to step in accordance with necessity. Every finality, for example, must generate an anti-finality (antithesis?). Every dialectical process must produce a countervailing social force, an anti-dialectic. A member of a group is inevitably converted into a common individual and the common individual is ineluctably transformed into an inorganic being, an entity which the group uses for its own ends. All praxis is necessarily dominated by scarcity. Sartre clearly maintains that necessity, as the apodictic structure of dialectical experience, imposes itself as „the interiorization of the exterior and in the exteriorization of the interior" 1#. In all of these assertion he injects into his analysis of social phenomena an Hegelian necessity. This is apparent when he remarks that , critical experience' (understood in terms of an intelligible dialectic) is nothing but the „fundamental identity of a singular life and human history" (l'identité fondamentale d'un vie singulière et de l'histoire humaine ). Just as Hegel had thought that historical events are dominated by an overriding , destiny' so, too, does Sartre refer to the , destiny' of social developments. Just as Hegel had said that ,the real is the rational and the rational is the real', so, too, does Sartre seem to say that what is real (as a social fact) is rational and hence capable of complete rational expli- cation. In his Lectures on the Philosophy of History Hegel had been concerned with what is rational in history and, hence, was uninterested in the contingent except insofar as it could be assimilated to a necessary process. That is, as has recently been said, Hegel ignored „the unex- plainable, the irrational, and the merely contingent of which world history largely consists" 20. In his Critique Sartre has also tended to avoid an analysis of the irrational factors contributing to social processes thereby neglecting the insights of sociologists such as Le Bon and Pareto. The individual's relationship to history in Hegel's philosophy of history is paralleled by the relationship between the individual and the group in Sartre's social analyses. For, the individual's praxis contributes to the " Ibid., p. 625. 19 Ibid., p. 157. 20 Louis Dupré, The Philosophical Foundations of Marxism.

The freedom of the individual in Sartre's work is sacrificed for the freedom of , humanity4 or collective groups just as the individual is sacrificed, for Hegel, in order that the ,Idea4 of freedom be fully realized in time. Just as freedom, for Hegel, is the recognition of historial necessity, freedom, for Sartre, is the recognition of the apodictic necessity of the social dialectic. The influence of Hegel on Sartre's social analysis has led him to negate the contingency, the freedom of individual practice, which he intendend to preserve from the strictures of a dogmatic Marxist conception of dialectic. Because of this undermining of his funda- mental intention Sartre's description of the relationship between the individual and the group, individual freedom and social necessity, is fundamentally paradoxical. Ultimately he is, lik the dogmatic Marxists he attacks, quite willing to sacrifice individual freedom to a dialectical necessity which although not in nature, dominates all social relations and developments.
