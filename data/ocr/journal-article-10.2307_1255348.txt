<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT UPON THE RELIGIOUS IDEAS AND PRACTICES OF THE ABORIGINES OF NORTHERN ASIA. BY M. A. CZAPLICKA. (Read at Meeting, December 17th, 1913.) THE term "environment" must be understood to cover not only strictly physical conditions, but also the botanical and zoological features of a given locality. Environment in this sense is bound to play a large part in determining the nature of the mentality of the inhabitants and in moulding the form of their political and religious institutions. Of course a knowledge of the environment cannot give us an exact picture of the biological and psychological type of people who inhabit it. There is always something to be allowed for "variants" in describing the physical type of man or animal, even if we are perfectly conscious of all the features of a given environment. The same amount of the unexpected and accidental must be allowed for in describing the mental character of man and animal, even when we know all the psychological factors. Still, the " variants " form only " the last touch " of a mentality, and the environmental conditions form its main part. This principle may be exemplified by a study of the social and religious life of the natives of Northern Asia or Siberia, together with the study of their environment. Siberia stretches from the Ural mountains "eastwards across 130 degrees of the meridian to the Pacific Ocean. Its northern boundary is formed by the Arctic Ocean,</page><page sequence="2">The Aborzg-ines of Northern Asia. 35 whence it extends across 30 degrees of latitude southwards to China and Turkestan, forming its southern frontiers."1 This vast region, of an area of about 4,833,500 square miles, is larger than Europe and more than twice the size of European Russia, and forms one-fourth of the whole Asiatic continent. In the south its parallel is roughly 50? N., and its West meridian is 60? E. The Siberian frontiers are very inaccessible. In the south the mountains and deserts divide it from China; in the east mountains separate it from the seas, and these seas, especially the Okhotsk Sea, are not navigable, because of the ice and fog. It is true that in the north Siberia is open to the sea, but the Arctic Ocean is not available for permanent navigation, in spite of the many attempts at finding "a north-east passage" and in spite of Norden- ski6ld's success in passing through it. Only the west Siberian frontier is more accessible to the European, thanks to the low middle Ural Mountains, and thanks to the nearness of the Siberian rivers; and through this way all the migrations of people, first from Northern Asia to Europe, and then from Europe to Northern Asia, were possible. With regard to the structure and geology of the Siberian surface one can divide it into:-(A) Western Siberia, of tertiary formation,2 consisting of the flat, marshy country between the Yenisei River and the chain of the Ural Mountains; and (B) Eastern Siberia, situated east of the Yenisei, of older geological formation, rising here and there into hills difficult of access, culminating in high mountains on the south and east of the Lena River, and stretching to the extreme north-east along the mountains that form the watershed of the Pacific slope.3 A third physical district can be differentiated in Siberia, the Amur region, draining east of the watershed into the 1Stanford's Comnpendium of Geography etc., Asia, vol. i., p.

Being surrounded by mountains keeping off the hot winds from the south, and being open to the northern winds, Siberia has a cold and continental climate in which the windows break with the cold, the milk is sold in pieces, the people become blind from the glittering snows, and one's breath becomes frozen. The ground, except for the surface, remains always frozen in the northern part of Siberia. As at a certain distance from the surface the ground keeps the average temperature of the year, and as all over Siberia the average temperature is below o?, the ground remains frozen for the whole year, notwithstanding certain seasonal differences in climate. When a well was dug in Yakutsk as deep as 380 feet below the ground the temperature was below o?. In this eternal ice the bodies of diluvial animals, mammoths, etc., long ago extinct, have been found preserved, with bones, flesh, and hair.4 Eastern Siberia is cooler than Western, except for the immediate polar regions, but the greater change of climate regulating the botanical and zoological conditions is to be observed from north to south. These differences from north to south are the ones with which we shall be concerned. We shall roughly divide the whole of this vast region into two climatic areas: A. The Northern area with the truly Arctic climate, and B. The Southern or Sub-Arctic area. It would be difficult to draw a line between them, but the Northern area would certainly descend more south in the east than in the west. The flat and low-lying Northern area facing the neigh- bouring archipelago of New Siberia and the more distant Wrangel Land form a true Arctic region, lying entirely 4 Nalkowski, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="4">The Aborzigines of Northern Asia. 37 within the Arctic circle, and with the northernmost point of the continent at Cape Severo, close to Cape Chelyuskin, in 78? 20' N. lat. and I04? E. long.5 Its low level and exposed northern aspect, combined with its high latitude and enormous extension southwards, are the chief reasons which cause the climate of this region to be the most "con- tinental," as it is technically termed, that is, subject to the greatest extremes of cold and heat, of any on the globe "Siberian" winters have become proverbial, but the summers are almost equally intense; and, while the mercury becomes frozen to a hard malleable mass during the clear Arctic nights in midwinter, it will occasionally rise to above oo00 F. at midday in June.6 " Temperature and Illumination constitute the chief characteristics of the polar climate, the former in the long cold winter and the short cool summer, the latter in the long winter night and the long summer day."7 " During the greater part of the three summer months (June, July, August), the sun is above the horizon con- tinuously for 65 days in latitude 70?, and for 134 days in latitude 80?. The summer temperatures are very unequal in the different parts of the polar district, but are dependent, not so much on the latitude, as on the distribution of land and water, and on the presence or absence of warm currents." 8 In no other place except Labrador is the temperature so low.

To this temperature we must add the frequency of snow-storms.9 Following the change of climate from north to south we can divide Siberia into two physical zones: (a), Northern zone with a polar climate, covered with tundra and tayga, and (b), Southern zone with a sub-polar climate covered with steppes, fertile valleys, and mountains. The Northern zone is covered with frozen swamp, and, where ice does not cover the ground, the frozen desert or tundra predominates. " Only in the less cold and therefore chiefly southern tracts in the arctic zone, in more favour- able localities" are to be found "willow-bushes and small meadows on river-banks and in fjords, or even formations of dwarf shrubs, which consist of a denser growth of the same evergreen, small-leaved, shrubby species as appear singly in the tundra between mosses and lichens .... A distinction is made between Moss-tundra or Polytrichum-tundra, and Lichen-tundra. . . . Where the climate is most rigorous the vegetation forms only widely separated patches on the bare, usually stony soil, and we have Rock-tundra. Shallow depressions of the tundra, where the water of melted snow and ice accumulates in the soil, become swamps in the form of Tundra-moor." In certain places protected from the drying winds oases are formed, "where the sunbeams fall almost perpendicularly, and thus warm the water in the soil so that plants can obtain it in actual abundance."10 South of tundra there extends tayga, i.e. primitive pine forests growing on the swampy ground and abounding in furry animals. Tayga is thus the boundary land between the northern and southern zones of Siberia. The primitive state of nature in the northern zone determines the human life. Taking into consideration the poor quality of the grasses and the enormous expanses covered with moss, lichen, and marshes, cattle-breeding as 9W. Jochelson, The Koryak, p. 392. 10A. F. W.

Fishing and the hunting of sea- mammals (the whale and others), can be carried on in the summer only, so that during the long winter the maritime population has to depend exclusively upon its summer supplies. Reindeer - breeding, though affording a more reliable source of sustenance to the wandering reindeer people than that offered by hunting and fishing to the maritime people, is still in a most primitive state,1l owing chiefly to the deficient vegetation. The people live for nine months of the year in underground or half-under- ground houses. The Southern zone, or rather south-western portion of it, is a lowland country, but considerable highland tracts are included in the southern and eastern sections.12 These highlands, often comprehensively spoken of as the Altai system, begin properly north of Lake Taisan and the Upper Irtish valley, by which their westernmost extremity is clearly separated from the Tarbagatai range. On this account the Tarbagatai, although usually included in the Siberian mountain systems, has to be regarded rather as the northernmost extension of the Tian-shan. Its true position is that of a water-parting between the Arctic and the Central Asiatic closed basins. For it sends down streams northwards to the Irtish, flowing to the Frozen Ocean through the Obi, southwards to Lakes Ala and Sassik, which formerly communicated westwards with Lake Balk- hash, and eastwards with the Ebi-nor and the Mongolian Mediterranean. From the Irtish valley the Altai or "Gold Mountains" stretch mainly north-eastwards through the Sayan range to the Daurian Alps, and thence beyond the Baikal basin under diverse names, such as the Yablonovoy and Stanovoy. to the volcanic masses filling the greater part of Kamchatka, 11W.

But it will be seen that the system is by no means continuous, being not only broken up into distinct sections by the deep gorges of the Upper Yenisei and Selenga Rivers, but merging round the Sea of Okhotsk into a moderately elevated plateau, where high ranges formerly figured on most of our maps. " Even the western section- that is, the Altai proper-is not so much a distinct moun- tain range as an aggregate of more or less detached chains running in various directions between the Upper Irtish and Yenisei valleys."13 Agriculture is possible in some fertile valleys, most of the flat country being occupied by steppes. The Ishym steppe (between the Ishym and Irtish rivers), and the Barabine steppe (between the Irtish and the Obi), are the largest steppes where pastoral life is possible, although the abund- ance of swamps, with millions of annoying insects (which force the natives to wear masks),l4 and with a local illness called sibirskaya iazva, make the open-air life not always comfortable.15 The hunting life is followed in the forests. All over this zone the climate, although no longer " polar," is typically "continental," except for the higher mountains. The people are mostly nomadic. About the people inhabiting these regions Nordenskiold in The Voyage of the Vega gives the following impression :- "Of the Polar races, whose acquaintance I have made, the reindeer Lapps undoubtedly stand highest; next to them come the Eskimo of Danish Greenland. . . . Next to them in civilisation come the Eskimo of north-western America. . . . Next come the Chukchis. . . . Last of all come the Samoyeds, or at least the Samoyeds who inhabit 13 Stanford's Compendium of Geography etc., Asia, vol. i., p. 170. 14 S.

The Samo- yeds and Chukchis, as well as other natives of Northern Asia unknown to Nordenskiold, occupy the lowest position in the culture of the polar races. All the inhabitants of Northern Asia have been called till recently (i.e. till Schrenck),17 Ural-Altaians. This name was first used by Castren,18 and was based on linguistic coincidences in agglutinative dialects of the Finnic, Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, and Samoyedic languages. Max Miiller, following Castren, calls the Ural-Altaic linguistic group the northern division of the Turanian Family.19 Right or not, the term Ural-Altaian is very vague for a linguistic group, placing Finnish and Tungusic languages in the same class, and still more unsatisfactory from an ethnological and historical point of view, for it can be applied to different Mongolo-Turco-Finnic tribes all over the world, whereas the branches of these people living in Northern Asia form a special "groupe ethnique." I shall not attempt to solve this difficult problem of finding a common ancestor for such different nations as Finns and Tunguses, even if their languages proved to be similar; but I shall propose a geographical and historical name for all those people of Finnic, Mongolic, Turkic, Samoyedic, and Tungusic origin, or of their branches, who have inhabited Siberia for a long period of time. The name which seems to me the safest for purposes of comparison is Siberians, or more exactly Neo-Siberians, as contrasted with the most ancient inhabitants of Siberia, i.e. Palaeo- Siberians,about whom Schrenck gave us the first information. This group (Palaeo-Siberians) consists of unclassified tribes 16 N. A. E. Nordenskiold, op. cit., pp. 29-30. 17 L. Schrenck, Ob Inorodcah Arnzrskago Kraya (I883). 18 M. A.

Schrenck 20 calls them the Palaeo-Asiatic, or North-east Palaeo-Asiatic, tribes, and supposes that they have occupied much larger territories in Northern, perhaps Central, Asia, and have been driven to the inhospitable north-eastern regions by more recent comers, partly Mongols, partly Turks or Finns, in one word by Neo-Siberians, or, using Castren's name, Ural-Altaians. Until linguistic and archaeological investigation shall have classified these people, I propose to keep the name of Palaeo-Siberians for Palaeo-Asiatics, and I shall do this so as not to confuse these old Asiatics with other races of Palaeo-Asiatics in the West and South of Asia. This term, as well as Neo-Siberians, does not demand any explanation, and is suitable for our comparative study of the natives of this region. The Palaeo-Siberians are typical representatives of "people from the borders," like the Basques in the Iberian peninsula. These people seem to be historically the oldest in the region, but for some reason, either of their decay or of the greater number of the newcomers, they have been deprived of their land and forced to migrate to the often unfertile border lands. In physical type the Palaeo- as well as Neo-Siberians have a more or less Mongolic type, especially in skull structure, although among the former sometimes quite a European type is to be found.21 The Palaeo-Siberians have been called by Fr. Muller "The Arctic or Hyperborean races," in which term he in- cludes also Aleuts and Eskimo.22 In Peschel's Volkerkunde 20 L. Schrenck, op. cit., p. 257. 21 Virchov, Douitz i Anuchin, quoted by L. Schrenck, vol. i., p. 254. 22 Allgereine Ethnographie (Wien, I873), p. I88.</page><page sequence="10">The Abor,-ignes of Northern Asia. they form two groups of Mongolic peoples. The one group, consisting of the Ostiaks of Yenisei, the Yukaghirs, Ainu, and Gilyaks, he calls Nordasiateln Von unbestim/-mter syste- matischer Stellung' (the North Asiatics without a definite position); the other group at the extreme east and including Tlingit [Kolush] and Vancouver tribes, he calls the " Bering tribes." But, in the first place, not all those people are actually Hyperborean; and then, if the Yukaghirs and the Gilyaks are the "Northern Asiatics without a definite position," the others, e.g. Koryaks and Kamchadals, deserve the same name. The whole population of Siberia was in I897 about 5,727,000, but, if we remember that the Europeans (Russians and Poles mostly) are more than 5 millions in number, we shall see how very scarce are the natives of the country. According to Stanford's Compendium (I906), the Palaeo- Siberians would number about 300,000, and the Neo- Siberians about 750,000, but the statistics of Patkanoff,23 published in 1912, and based on the same census of 1897 as Stanford's Compendium, show a somewhat different number of aborigines. The Palaeo-Siberians consist of: I. Chukchis, between the Anadyr River, north-eastern Siberia, and the Arctic Ocean (except the north-eastern extremity). According to Stanford's Conmpendium their number is 12,000, but according to Patkanoff I ,77I. II.

Jochelson, Etnologicheskia problemy na Siewiernyh Bieregah Tihavo Okeana, 1908, however, does not include this tribe among the Palaeo-Asiatics, and says that they form a wedge among them. But, as our classification is a geographical one, we shall include them among Palaeo-Siberians. 25The Ostiaks of Yenisei form, according to Patkanoff (op. cit., p. 106), the western or Yenisei branch of the Palaeo-Asiatics, and are the remains of a former (seventeenth and eighteenth century) large group composed of Arines, Kotts, Assans, etc. As the result of a communication from Dr. L. Sternberg of Petersburg, who does not consider these people Palaeo-Asiatics, I prefer to adopt the above classification of the Ostiaks of Yenisei only with some reserve; still, as our classification is geographical, we can call them Palaeo-Siberians.</page><page sequence="12">The Aborzgiies of Norf/ern Asia.

Accord- ing to Stanford's ComLpendium they number 80,000, but according to Patkanoff 76,507. The study of the life of the natives can be advantageously limited to the study of their shamanism, which covers the psychological as well as the sociological features of these 45</page><page sequence="13">46 The Religious Ideas and Practices of people. According to such scholars on Siberia as Jochel- son and Klementz, and such native scientists as Banzaroff and Khangaloff, their shamanistic cult differs, in their con- ceptions about the deities and in ritual, from that of other primitive religions; though of course, taking it compara- tively, this cult answers to the pre-animistic and animistic cults of other primitives. " One must not lose sight," says Klementz, "of the fact that in the various beliefs of the Siberian tribes a very close connexion is noticeable, and, likewise, there can be observed an uninterrupted identity in the foundations of their mythology and in their rites, even extending as far as the nomenclature-all of which gives one the right to suppose that these beliefs are the result of the joint work of the intellectual activity of the whole north of Asia."26 Shamanism, although officially existing only among a small portion of those 750,000 natives, is yet very strong there, under the Buddhistic and Mohammedan surface among Neo-Siberians, as well as in the nominally Christian hearts of Palaeo-Siberians. This shamanism is, however, differentiated by the influence of environment into two subordinate types, which may be termed " northern" and " southern." The "northern" type, however, corresponds not quite strictly to the geographical northern zone. The line dividing the "northern" and "southern" types of shaman- ism forms a diagonal running from south-west to north-east of the Siberian area. As has been said, when dealing with climate, this division corresponds to the two climatic regions, arctic and sub-arctic. Ceremonials. In the northern type of shamanism, or among the Palaeo- Siberians, the influence of darkness, cold, and scarcity of food is to be observed in all social and religious ideas. 26 J. Hastings, The Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, vol. iii., p. 2.</page><page sequence="14">The Aborz,igines of Norlhern Asia. The family and clan structure is not very highly developed,27 except among the Gilyaks. Life in underground houses during the greater part of the year directs the mental powers towards introspective thinking; hence the prevalence of hysteria, of revelations, of divination, and of sexual perversions. Ceremonials are almost exclusively seasonal, and are connected with the food supply or the expulsion of bad spirits. For instance, Jochelson gives the following list of festivals and sacrifices among the Koryaks: 28 Maritime Koryaks: I. Whale Festival. 2. The putting away of the skin boat for the winter. 3. Launching the skin boat. 4. Wearing of masks. Reindeer-breeding Koryaks: I. Ceremony on return of the herd from summer pastures. 2. The fawn festival. Ceremonies comzmon to both: I. Bear festival. 2. Wolf festival. 3. Practices in connection with fox-hunting. On the other hand, in the southern type of shamanism, or among the Neo-Siberians, life amid varied scenery, con- sisting of open country and mountains, has led to the worship of the sky and the heavenly bodies. Comparative abundance of food permits certain spontaneous ceremonial expressions of religious feelings, not necessarily con- nected with the food supply. Imagination is very much developed.

There is no clear idea of an anthropomorphic god among the Palaeo-Siberians. Gods and spirits are mostly half animals, like the Big Raven, their chief god. The dis- tinction between men and animals disappears in myths and in representations of superior beings, such as fetishes called Ongon (a Mongolic word). The animals on which the people depend for sustenance are objects of cult, (viz. the whale and other sea animals among maritime tribes, and the reindeer among reindeer-breeding tribes, the bear, wolf, and fox being common to both). Inanimate objects of worship, so-called "things en- chanted," are frequently symbols of these animals. An example of this is found in the ceremony performed most regularly by the Chukchis at the slaughtering of the reindeer, where pictures of certain parts of the animal are used as Ongons (fetishes); but, as Jochelson says, "The notions as to the direct interference of the Supreme Being with worldly affairs are very confused. Men seem to be left to their own resources in their struggle with evil spirits, diseases, and death."29 Among the Neo-Siberians in some tribes, e.g. the Yakuts and the Altaians, there is a monotheistic tendency; among the Buriats, Ostiaks, and Woguls there is a regular polytheism.30 The Supreme God of the Altaians is Ulghen, of the Yakuts Uyun-Artoyen. The Buriats have no supreme deity, but a whole assembly of them. The Ongon,-called by the Turkic tribes Tyns and by the Altaians Kurmes,-is not merely a fetish, but the image of a god invested with his power. Animals such as the horse, eagle, hedgehog, swan, and snake are respected, but do not rise to the rank of protectors or zayans, such as are found in the form of deified human beings like the shamans. Here also the bear is venerated, except by the Buriats. 29 The Koryak, p. 25. 30Agapitoffand Khangaloff, Banzaroff, Wierbicki, Potanin.</page><page sequence="16">The Aborigines of Northern Asia. AnimZismii and Pre-A ninism. Among the Palaeo-Siberians pre-animism dominates animism. No distinction is made in their beliefs between animate and inanimate things, and the incantations which form the main substance of their religious practices have power to invest with a temporary soul, or rather a kind of mana, any object chosen. The animism of these Palaeo-Siberians is marked by the conception of a soul belonging to each part of an animal or thing, the soul of the head, the soul of the breast, etc. Although all over Siberia there is a dualism in the spirit world, this division is very chaotic among Palaeo-Siberians, and their good and bad spirits do not always retain their characteristics. As Jochelson says,31 "Although, on the whole the word 'Kala' denotes all powers harmful to man and all that is evil in nature, there are numbers of objects and beings known under the name of' Kalak' or 'Kamak' that do not belong to the class of evil spirits." Thus the guardian spirits of the Koryak shamans and some varieties of guardians of the village, of the family, or of individuals are called by this name. The worship of " black" spirits, however, prevails among Palaeo-Siberians, while among Neo-Siberians we find either a strictly dualistic division in which the good and bad spirits have their typical characteristics, or, among tribes such as the Wotiaks and Tunguses, the worship of white spirits is predominant. Among the Palaeo-Siberians, even at sacrifices offered to white spirits the black spirits receive their share, -otherwise the kala might intercept the sacrifice and pre- vent its reaching the Supreme Being.32 31 The Koryak, p. 30. 32 The Koryak, p. 93. I should like to add that my opinion as to the black spirits being more prevalent than white in the northern type of shamanism is not shared, in regard to the Koryak, by one of my chief authorities on Palaeo- Siberians, i.e. Jochelson, who on the contrary says that "among the Koryak the cult of benevolent spirits is more conspicuous," (p. 92), but my theory is D 49</page><page sequence="17">50 The Religious Ideas and Practices of Among the Chukchis bad spirits are called kelet, and W. Bogoraz33 distinguishes as many as three different classes of kelet: (i), Invisible, producing sickness; (2), Blood-thirsty cannibals; and (3), Spirits which on the call of certain (black) shamans help them. Good spirits are called in Chukchi va'irgit. The sun is a va'irgit and the moon is kele. The Koryak called bad spirits kala, but they have no generic name for good spirits.34 The Gilyak call their bad powers knin and milk, and the good bol, lot, and urzif In connection with the featureless landscape the ideal division of the universe is vertical (into upper and lower worlds) rather than horizontal, and the bad spirits live mostly underground. Among the Neo-Siberians animism has developed to a very gfeat extent. They worship the whole universe, especially the celestial bodies, and they believe them all to be animated by a kind of soul, sometimes called idgins (lords).35 The human soul is, according to them, composed of three parts. Among the Yakuts it is composed of: (i), tyn, a breath soul, common to man, animal, and plant; (2), kut, a physical soul composed of earth, air, and a material element, common to men and all animals except fishes; (3), sur, a psychic soul, which has no shadow and enters the mother through the temples before the birth of the child.36 The Buriats believe that man is composed of: (i), oyeye, material body; (2), amin, lower soul, breath; (3), sunyesun, exemplified by what Jochelson says on the next page (93), as well as by other statements of Jochelson on the Koryak and Yukaghir and by other authors on Palaeo-Siberians. 33 The Chukchee (I904), p. 292. 3 This fact is also in favour of my opinion that black spirits are more powerful among Palaeo-Siberians. a5 Banzaroff, Chornaya Wiera (1893), pp. 6-19. 36Trostjanski, Evolucia Chornoy Wiery (Shamansiva) u Yakutov (1902), pp. 71-79.</page><page sequence="18">The Aborigines of Northern Asia. the soul belonging to man only. The sunyesun is absent when man sleeps, and when the amin goes away the man dies. The Finnic Woguls and Ostiaks believe that man is com- posed of (i), earthly part; (2), the shadow, isi; and (3), the soul, liii khelmkholas.37 Religious dualism is more marked than among Palaeo- Siberians, and the veneration of "white" spirits predom- inates. Among the Buriats the greatest worship is given to the sky, tengrei; hence they venerate the sun, moon, and many spirits inhabiting the sky,-tengreis; they acknow- ledge 99 different tengreis, of which 55 are from the west,- good spirits, because the west wind is beneficial,-and only 45 are eastern, hostile tengreis.38 Two of the most conscientious writers on Siberia, Agapitoff and Khangaloff, are of opinion that in the 99 tengreis the heavens in their different aspects are personified, e.g. calm, storm, gale, wind, etc. Klementz thinks that among the Buriats along the Kuda river the white tengreis existed before the black ones. Among the Yakuts good spirits are called aiy and bad abassy, but among the Yakuts who migrated from south to north the white spirit Etugen, who was formerly supreme, has been displaced by a black spirit, as is testified by Trostjanski.39 Contrary to the Buriats their bad spirits are from the west and their good spirits from the east. Among the Finnic tribes, Ostiaks and Woguls, the chief of the white spirits is Yanitch-torum, and the chief of the black spirits is Kul, who is also ruler of the world of shadows. Gondatti, from whom we have this information, states that these natives have not now the religious fear 37 Gondatti, Sledy Yazychestva u Inorodcev Sievero-zapadnoy Sibiri (I888), P. 39. 38 Agapitoff and Khangaloff, Materiauy dia izuchenia Shamanstva v Sibiri (1883), pp. 3-23. 39 Trostjanski, op. cit., p. 158. 5I</page><page sequence="19">52 The Religious Ideas and Practices of and terror of black powers which exists among certain primitive tribes.40 The Altaians 41 call their good spirits aisi and their bad spirits kawa or kuremes. Among all Altaic Tartars the dualistic division is most clear, and the highest god, Tengre Kaira Khan, is a good power. The local division of the universe is partly horizontal, partly vertical; the good spirits live in seventeen floors above the earth, and the bad occupy seven or nine under the earth, and Erlik-Khan, the chief of the bad spirits, lives on the lowest floor, where the sun and moon are supposed to give only a very feeble light. This Erlik-Khan is held to have emanated from a heavenly spirit, which shows that even in the past the white spirits were predominant. Mythology. The mythology of the Palaeo-Siberians is preoccupied with stories concerning Big Raven, but sometimes the Chukchi kelet and the Koryak kalau also play a part; on the whole, imagination is poor, the language obscure but voluptuous, and the physiological functions of the human body often form the chief episodes.42 The Aino-Gilyak myths, though they include a great many North Pacific elements, chiefly resemble those of the Japanese in their description of animal life. The Palaeo-Siberian mythology does not differentiate between natural and supernatural, animate and inanimate objects, whereas the Neo-Siberian mythology is less animis- tic, in the sense that they believe the transformation of animate into inanimate objects to be the result of super- natural power. Their rich and hyperbolic language could not have originated in the polar regions. While the heroes 49Gondatti, op. cit., p. 6. 41 Wierbicki, Altayskie Inorodcy (I893). 42 W.

The tales concerning animals are very similar to fables. Shamanism. Family shamanism is more important among Palaeo- Siberians than professional shamanism. In fact the latter is but slightly developed, since the environment does not encourage social aggregation. Among Koryaks and Kham- chadales there is scarcely any social organisation apart from the family. Among the Chukchis and Yukaghirs clan organisation is in its infancy. With such social conditions it is not surprising that the shaman is merely the head of the family. On the contrary, among the Neo-Siberians43 professional shamans are not only more important but almost the only ones, as the function of the head of the family is quite separate. Among Palaeo-Siberians lack of light and of suitable materials results in a poor shamanistic apparatus. The shamanistic coat and cap which play such a large part among the Neo-Siberians are here not required, as the ceremonies are mostly performed in the dark and close underground houses. Those tribes, the Yakuts and Gilyaks, who ethnologically fall into a different group from that to which they at present geographically belong, present to us a curious mixture of the old religious and social conceptions and those they have acquired in the new environment. The Gilyaks, originally a more Nordic tribe,44 migrated south- wards, especially in the island of Sakhalin, and there they adopted in their shamanistic ceremonials, dress, and beliefs 43S. N. Potanin, Ochorki Sieviero Zapadnoy Mongolii (I88I), pp. 8I-95. See also N. M. Yadrintzeff, Sibirskie Inorodcy (189I), pp. 110-132. 44 Sternberg, Giliaki Ethnogr.

This, however,could be explained by contact with the more cultured Tunguses, but, in the case of the Yakuts, a Turkic tribe whose original home is probably in the South near the Tarim, one cannot suppose that they have been influenced by the much lower culture of the Nordic tribes. It is much more probable, as Trostjanski suggests, that "with the change of habitation from the brighter south to the severe north, where the sun hides its light for some months of the year, the sky and sun ceased to be gods."45 One of the most curious complex ceremonials of the Yakuts is the kumiss festival.46 It origin- ated in the land of the horse, and is only performed symbolically in the land of the reindeer, or else the custom and festivals associated with the use of kumiss quite dis- appear in the new land; thus environment changes the customs and modifies the beliefs.
