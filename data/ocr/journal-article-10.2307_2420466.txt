Floras are dynamic units undergoing constant transformations. Their apparent static condition is a delusion, relevant to the short span of human life, and of human experience as a whole. There has been in the floras of the past a dynamism which, displayed on the 'general geological background, stands out so prominently that it can hardly be questioned in the present state of science. Plant groups, featuring original novelties in life structures, have appeared more or less suddenly in the dim past, have shooted, seemingly by mutations, a rich array of forms. In the end, however, having exhausted the po3sibilities of the basic types, having become fixed, whole groups of plants have disappeared from the face of the world, leaving, for us to read, scanty engraved records among the rocks. Over the stage of Time have passed those primitive dummy figures of vascular plants, the Devonian Psilophytales: Psilophyton of Gaspe, Rhynia of Scotland, mere shadows cast ahead by life in the making, plants where no differentiation of the vegetative body into root, stem and leaves was yet ob- vious. Then marched on the graceful legions of Pteridosperms, fern-like seed- bearing plants. A dream-like picture! A forest canopy of immense lacy fronds with fruits as large as plums hanging underneath! A forest floor car- peted with a thick and continuous layer of golden pollen. And later, unfold- ing under the sun of what are now the Dakotas, the strange Cycadeoideas, things of beauty two feet across, striving to become real flowers! They were only of course clusters of branching stamens, and had not yet evolved che showy structures which we call petals and corollas, but they were heralding, together with the Caytoniales, -those strange "angiospermic ferns", of the Middle Jurassic, - the advent of the gorgeous multitude of Angiosperms: the * Based on a lecture entitled "The Vanishing Floras of Northeastern America" and delivered on the occasion of "The Julius Arthur Nieuwland Memorial Exercises" held at The University of Notre Dame.

Psilophytales, Pteridosperms, Cycadeoideas, Caytoniales, they are all gone. They had vanished hundreds of millions of years before stone age man ever stood gazing in front of his cave, wondering at the already weathzred world to which he has been bringing a rejuvenating and powerful ecological factor: the human mind. They have vanished, but the flow of life is still as bubbling as ever, pushing through its devious course, opening new channels, turning away from the old ones. The restless and irreversible stream of life is with us, within us, around us. Our living flora is undoubtedly on the march. Its present figure is a short episode that will be soon a thing of the past. Is it possible to detect in the living flora of our own portion of the bio- sphere, -let us call it eastern Canada, -obvious and measurable manifesta- tions of this permanent dynamism? Is it possible to feel the pulse of this great vital current of which we know neither whence it has come, nor whither it goes? What are the influences which, at the present stage of life's history, govern the changes of this more or less defined unit? If life travels along a certain line, how -can we mark the present position? The possibilities concerning the dynamic or static condition of a flora are rather few. Does this flora represent a primitive and undisturbed equilibrium? Or, after a long, onward march, has it reached a mature phase, a senile condi- tion where its dynamism is exhausted? Or, is it rather a phase in a phenom- enon of movemmnt, a point on an open curve? To look at our living flora as having preserved an undisturbed primitive equilibrium, is a geological and biological absurdity, especially in this old land of the Laurentian shield, time and again buried under seas, now a mountain range, and now eroded into a peneplain; and finally base leveled and polished by repeated Pleistocene glaciations. The conception of a life-complex which has come to rest after a long dis- play of dynamism during geological ages can be viewed as a possibility by the scientific layman. Certain descriptions of natural habitats found in the earlv records of American discovery seem to hold true to this day. Thus a few lines from Jacques Cartier's travels, describing the vegetation of the sand dunes of Brion, on the Magdalen Islands, seem to have been writt-n yestcrcr-v: Cestedite ille est la milleure terre que nous ayon veu, car vng arpant d'icelle terre vault mieulx que toute la terre Neufve.

And still could be seen the so-called "Wheat" (Elymus arenarius var. villosus), that most interesting sturdy grass of the sandy sea- shore, which never ventures inland; the deliciously fraarant Ladies' Tresses (Spiranthes Romanzoffiana); the remarkably large-fruited Strawberry (Fragaria virginiana var. terrae-novae); the large Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon). There also were the Scotch Lovage (Ligusticum scothicum) and the coastal plain Rose (Rosa virginiana), thousands of pink stars over the sandy tract (Fig. 1). Fig. 1.

(Photo Marcelle Gauvreau). Macoun the elder found Michaux's unmistakable station for Primula mistassinica, after a century. In the same way not only aggregate Linnaean species, but mere micromorphs are apparently static. Michaux's type of Artemisia canadensis is one of several micromorphs of this species growing on the sands of Lake St. Tohn. After a century and a half, the writer found, identical in all details the exact micromorph which Michaux, or better Louis- Claude Richard had in hand when describing the species. Using a too well-known method, one might multiply greatly the facts and evidences of this nature, selecting and sorting them in order to build up a demonstration of the stability of plant populations, demonstration which might be entirely satisfactory to the layman. But, -centuries being in the history of life what mere seconds are in written history, - to the geologically and biologically trained mind, these facts and testimonies express but a lure of stability. In the same way, may we speak of the stability of our social and economic institutions, of the permanence of our laws and political charters. But all this in no way invalidates the more general reality of the movement of all that is.</page><page sequence="4">492 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST It would be extremely unlikely that plant associations, after all just a perishable living net spread over the granite shoulders of an old mountain range beaten and scarred by Time, should escape the Heraclitean law and be fixed and immutable. Plant life is function of environmental condi- tions unceasingly undergoing transformation. Plant associations and their units must then continually adapt themselves to new combinations of physio- logical and physiographical factors, and mold themselves to the changing environment. While this goes on, insufficiently plastic species drop out, while new and more suitable forms are produced to fill the gaps. The ultimate result in some sort of an apparently preserved equilibrium. Even though we are mainly dealing with the fluctuation or evolution of the units themselves, it is worth while to devote a moment of attention to the dynamism of the associations. Plant mosaics with interchangeable components are sometimes evident in space as well as in time. No botanist who visits Lake St. John in northern Quebec would fail to notice the extensive sands accumulated on the north side, by the age-long erosion of the great feeders of the lake: Ashuapmouchouan, Fig. 2.

The primitive forest here has been cut and burnt long ago. Owing to the scanty micro-flora of these sterile denuded soils, a very simple association rules over large tracts of ground. There reigns supreme the calcifugal Pinus Banksiana, one of the American allies of Pinus sylvestris of Europe. The individual pines usually stand somewhat apart and leave room for the common xerophytic chamaephytes so characteristic of acid soils in the north (Fig. 2). Here the chamaephytic part in the cast happens to be played by just one species, Comptonia asplenifolia. But the dense growth of Comptonia nevertheless leaves small gaps which, on account of the peculiar light conditions, can accommodate only such species, as for example</page><page sequence="5">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 493 PINUS BANKSIANA (~~~~~~~MTN ) @ PBANIKSIANA) COMPTOS [~~~~~~~~~~~~~ L ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ o 0 0 0 0 0 0 ~~~~0 0 0 Fig. 3.

The Pinus Banksiana - Co mptonia asplenifolia - Solidago puberula association of the Lake St. John sands is one of the most beautifully schematic phytomosaic patterns to be seen anywhere (Fig. 3). But the three units forming this particular phytomosaic are not so strictly defined and bound together that one of them cannot be replaced by a sub- stitute of the same biological type. In fact, Pinus Banksiana can be replaced by Pinus resinosa; Co mptonia asplenifolia by some ericaceous ecological equiv- alent (Kalmia angustifolia, Rhodora canadensis, Vaccinium angustifoliumr, Vaccinium canadense); and Solidago puberula by other virgate Goldenrods: Solidago squarrosa or Solidago macrophylla. To sum up, plant associations are living mosaics where, in accordance with the physical evolution of the ecological factors, and often independently, changes or substitutions in the units are slowly made. The equilibrium is that of the whole, and not necessarily that of the component parts. The mathe- matical product remains the same during long periods, but the sequence, order, and value of factors are submitted to ceaseless variations.</page><page sequence="6">494 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST There remains the view that our present floras are a phase in a phenom- enon of movement, a point on an open curve, or, - to put it in standard bio- logical language, that our modern floras are still in full evolution. The general thesis of plant evolution I do not care to develop here. Let it be sufficient to state that the critical study of the flora of eastern Canada has undoubtedly supplied fresh evidence that plant life continues a develop- ment initiated very long ago; that new systematic entities: species and varieties, seem to be actually in the making, and that the dynamic possibilities of plant life are no more exhausted by the present development of species, than by the normal ontogeny of individuals. The experimental method is, of course, out of question here, with "ensembles" of such magnitude and complexity, where the Time factor can- not be eliminated. Observation, comparison, and induction are the only courses possible. Observation of plants, comparison of their features, and mapping of their ranges show that there are endemic species, that is -species with a limited and consistent distribution. By the same methods it also becomes evident that there are epibiotic species, that is survivors of extinct floras or associations, persisting as relics far away from their main present ranges. It seems that, by the careful study of environmental factors, and of distri- bution, one can measure the minute morphological deviations undergone by epibiotic species. It also seems reasonable to explain the origin of endemics either by slow and continuous trainsformations, a Darwinian or Lamarckian process, or by sudden saltations, a mutational or DeVriesian process. Jules Tannery has pointed out that human minds have always been, and will always be, divided by two main tendencies. Some are mainly on the look- out for continuity, others persistently seek and find discontinuity. The history of mathematics, that of physics, hinge on these opposite instinctive human tendencies. Biological science could not develop otherwise, and this inherent duality has become evident once more when biologists have sought to fathom the mystery of evolution, - when they have become eager to measure the rate of flow of the majestic river of Life. Both these points of view will probably be needed to tell the whole story of plant evolution, if such a story can ever be told. The least that can be said is that good example of discontinuous evolution can be found even in the restricted flora of eastern Canada. Fig. 4 shows for comparison the head of the huge fleshy Senecio pseudo- Arnica of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and that of its mutant Senecio Rollandii. In Minganial large colonies of Senecio Rollandii stand clearly, and with- out transitions, out of the continuous line of Senecio pseudo-Arnica bordering the seashore. In Fig. 5, the zone in the foreground is formed of Elymus 1 I have ventured to coin the name "Mingania" for the striking geographical and biological unit formed by the Mingan Islands, on the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, opposite Anticosti Island.</page><page sequence="7">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 495 Fig. 4.

Then comes behind the zone of the halophytic suc- culent Senecio. The vertical line sharply separates S. pseudo-Arnica from its mutant S. Rollandii. A parallel situation obtains for several others of our northeastern species of Senecio, and in other genera of the family Compositae. I remember well having seen at La Loutre River, on Anticosti Island, a Sphagnum bog filled with the discoid mutant of Senecio pauperculus, while the familiar ray-bearing type seemed completely absent. This plant was treated later by Femald as Senecio pauperculus f. verecundus, but I feel very much inclined to give it specific rank as I did in the parallel case of Senecio Rollandii.

It is immaterial whether the orthodox taxonomist will treat discoid mutants in the Compositae as species, or discard them as trouble-makers, "forms" or monstrosities. There are no such things as monsters because there are no effects without cause. Michel Montaigne anticipating modem biological Fig. 7.

The main point is that these mutants bring something new to the living world, and reproduce their kind, as is evident from a fair number of instances. Another illustration of discontinuous evolution is found in the behavior of American Hawthorns. Fig. 6 shows Crataegus Victorinii, a well-defined endemic of the Montreal district, and which has seemingly originated there. Crataegus suborbicu- lata, Crataegus Jackii, Crataegus Brunetiana, Crataegus laurentiana and a host of other species of the St. Lawrence valley seem to be likewise extremely localized and to have originated through the same process, whatever this process may have been. I am well aware, from long field experience, of the biological implications of Crataegi. What is the real value of the multitude of species that have been described? And, when all is said, what is a species? But one thing can be said so far now: the different species of a given locality, if studied at flowering time are much better characterized and far more easily recognized</page><page sequence="10">498 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST than those of Epilobium, Aster, Antennaria, Rubus, Carex, Poa, and other critical polymorphous genera. The Hawthoms of northeastern America seem to be for the most part very young species. They are not forest types, but rather very exclusive heliotypes, plants of the open, invaders of neglected land, preferably calcareous (Fig. 7). Their more obvious response to this habitat is the abundant produc- tion of spines, simple on the branches, but very often compound on the main stems. Very striking is the similarity of the Crataegus problem in northeastern America with the Acacia problem of the African table-lands. The N' Gong upland plains of Kenya in equatorial Africa may be taken as a fair sample of the Acacia country (Fig. 8). We have again the open, dry land, here occu- Fig. 8. A bird's eye view of N'Gong Plains, in Kenya, Central Africa, an exten- sive grassy table-land occupied by a park-like association of thorny, mostly flat-topped Acacias (Acacia giraffae, A. horrida, etc.). (Photo Marie-Victorin). pied by millions of small or middle-sized flat-topped Acacia (A. giraffae, A. horrida, etc.), generally well provided with spines. It is the alluring typical big game country with the herds of giraffes feeding on the tree-tops. The general picture suggests those venerable Lamarckian days when naive biologists wondered whether the giraffe's neck had stretched to get to the level, or whether the Acacias had become flat-topped as a fixed hereditary response to grazing! . . . But the interesting thing is, that the African Acacias, and the American Crataegi, under similar stimulating ecological conditions, have shown a similar power to produce an enormous number of species, or forms (Fig. 9). Before the advent of the white man, the whole of the St. Lawrence valley was heavily forested, and outside of marshes and bogs, was almost entirely devoid of natural prairies. The dense and continuous coniferous or mixed forest precluded any important growth of Hawthorn colonies, save sparse in- dividuals scattered along streams, a condition still prevalent on the northern</page><page sequence="11">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 499 boundary of the genus: the Temiscamingue-Abitibi district, Lake St. John, the rivers of Anticosti and Gaspe. Rapid deforestation in the St. Lawrence valley, and the tributary valleys of Lake Champlain and of the Ottawa River, created ecological depressions that the shade-loving herbaceous or shrubby elements of the near-by forest could not occupy. The Prairies of the Mississippi valley were too far away to send out heliophile invaders. It so happened that, perforce, the ecological vacuum was filled by European herbaceous plants brought surreptitiously by the French settlers with seeds, the wool of sheep, and the military forage supplies unloaded from ships. But the local flora had a few woody heliophytes, to this moment strictly confined to river-banks, and ecologically equipped to invade pasture lands and the waste spaces about villages and towns. This seems to have been the story of the development of Crataegus in the St. Lawrence valley, and indeed, over all northeastern America. At the present period, the great Hawthorn populations, as could be ex- pected, are located mainly near the older settlements of the country: Quebec, Montreal, Toronto, Rochester, the sites of ancient Indian villages (Caughna- waga), of early Hudson Bay forts (Fort Temiscamingue, etc.). It seems safe to assume that the astonishing development of the genus in northeastern America, and particularly in the St. Lawrence valley, is an imme- diate biological response to the ecological disturbance or reduced compression brought about by deforestation and settling of the land. The fact that, in the St. Lawrence valley, very recently freed from the Wisconsin ice and emerged from the Champlain Sea waters, - and only yes- terday rendered available to Crataegi through deforestation and settlement, the fact that we have here a good number of strictly endemic species, points Fig. 9. Typical flat-topped Acacias of the N'Gong Plains, Kenya, Central Africa, an ecological case similar to that of the American Crataegi. (Photo Marie-Victorin).</page><page sequence="12">500 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST to the conclusion that the migration and multiplication of forms must have taken place during the short colonial period. We think we know the paths of migrations, which, mainly during historical times, have favored the wide distribution of the Hawthorns in the St. Law- rence valley. The center of dispersal seems to have been the temperate por- tion of the eastern United States, from which, following different lines, they have migrated over the entire continent, paving their way as they went with new forms. Inasmuch as the first idea, and the pioneer work on discontinuous evolu- tion, were based on Oenothera by Hugo de Vries and numerous workers along the same line, it is impossible to leave this subject without dealing with the Oenothera problem in northeastern Amcrica, and particularly in Quebec. The botanists of the last half century had conveniently and conservatively dumped the Oenotherae of eastern Canada into two vaguely defined specific entities: 0. biennis (for the inland plant) and 0. muricata (for the coastal plant). We now know much more about them through field inquiries made by the author, and by critical cultures and cytological studies by Prof. R. R. Gates. It seems that we are dealing here with an intricate group of types, or micromorphs, most of them very local, originating or having originated through hybridism or mutation. True 0. biennis, according to Gates, is a Linnaean type of unknown Amnerican origin, already naturalized on the sand-dunes of Holland in 1614. This type, probably a local endemic that happened to make the hop between Dutch America- and Europe, does not seem to have been collected or studied in America. The situation is almost the same for 0. muricata: most, if not all, of the northeastern material referred to that species is something else. For some reason or other, the St. Lawrence Valley happens to be excep- tionally rich in forms of Oenothera. Looking for reasons, one thinks of the abundance of sands and loose soils about the Great Lakes, and in the alluvial section of the St. Lawrence River from Montreal to Lake St. Peter; to the loose calcareous debris at the base of the Gaspe cliffs. On these shifting, warm, dry, air-filled, well-lighted loose soils, shunned by most vascular plants, Oenothera has seemingly found its optimum conditions, and developed during post-pleistocene times many local species, or at least interesting micromorphs. Already milestones have been established in this study. The commonest plant in the St. Lawrence valley from Toronto to below Quebec city, seems to be 0. Victorin ii, related to 0. pycnocarpa, a wide-spread plant in New York State. 0. Victorinii is definite enough, but undoubtedly a dynamic center of variation. Gates has now referred to 0. ammophiloides and its varieties, a part at least of the dominant sturdy glandular and large-flowered plants of the Gasp6 cliff-bases, but there is material here also of several purely endemic forms to be described when better known. But the richest Oenothera territory in Quebec and possibly in the whole of northeastern America, is perhaps the section of the fresh-water tidal shore of the St. Lawrence river in the vicinity</page><page sequence="13">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 501 of the Island of Orleans, Cape Tourmente and St. Vallier (mouth of Boyer River) (Fig. 10). This district was already famous for its estuarine endemics, of course of post-glacial origin: Gentiana Victorinii, Epilobium ecomosum, Bidens frondosa var. anomala, etc. In a previous paper I have ventured to explain the forma- tion of these endemics within the short span of the post-pleistocene, by an acceleration of the machinery of evolution due to peculiar factors involved in the intercotidal fresh-water habitat: double daily cycle of emersion and immer- sion, diminished competition, efficient devices for seed dispersal, etc. It seems that, although not being intercodcidal types, - Oenotherae plant- ing their rosettes at the top of the gravel-spit or beyond, but always out of the reach of the tide, - these plants have benefited in a large measure of some of the stimulating estuarne conditions of the lower St. Lawrence. Nowhere else in eastern Canada, can such a variety and abundance in Oenothera be seen: 0. leucophylla, 0. laevigata var. similis, 0. laevigata var.rubripunctata, Fig. 10. Mouth of River Boyer, St. Vallier, Que., where at the top of the gravel- spit thrive Oenothsera 1eucoph_y11a, 0. laevoigata var. similis, 0. lae-vigata var. rubri- puncalaa, 0. bif ormiflora, 0. biformiflora var. crucia Ia, 0. Victorinii var. intermedia, and other types of the same genus. (Photo Marie-Victorin). 0. biformi/lora, 0. biformiflora var. cruciata, 0. Victorinji var. intermedial, 0. angustissima var. quebecensis, 0. parva, and others to be unraveled. So.me of the species such as the large, shining and often almost glabrous 0. angustis- sima var. quebecensis, and the small narrow-leaved 0. parva, are remarkably well-defined (Fig. 11). Other scientific entitie-s that have been described are also striking, but perhaps less secure. Other districts, such as Lake St. John, the St. Maurice River lower valley, are also rich in puzzling forms, and would deserve careful study. In the Lake St. John country, we once had a thrilling experience. Hurrying to Mistas- sins one night after a strenuous field day, our attention was summoned by an</page><page sequence="14">502 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST abandoned sandy field, fully occupied by Oenothera. In this northern coun- try, summer days are long, and though it was past eight o'clock, the thousands of fully expanded primrose flowers presented a great sight and could be photo- graphed. But the real thrill for the botanist was more in the astounding multi- formity than in the mass beauty of the fading landscape. At least five differ- ent plants were there, largely grouped in pure colonies. There were groups of pale, eglandular plants, and groups of large, glandular and purple-tinged indi- viduals; colonies with straight inflorescences and others with all shafts char- acteristically bent in one direction. Outside of that field the Oenothera were Fig. 11. A pure colony of Oenothera parva, an endemic of the estuarine district of the Lower St. Lawrence. (Photo Marie-Victorin). neither particularly abundant nor varied. Whence had all these come? Had they come there already differentiated from seeds ripened far away? Or did differentiation take place here in the course of a few short years? Some botanists refuse to admit the multiplicity of the northeastern Oeno- thera on the ground that several forms are often found intermingled at the same place, and they ascribe this diversity to a wide-range fluctuation in a highly plastic group. But long field experience, with much attention given to these problems, shows that Oenothera populations, although sometimes exhib- iting several intermingled forms, are very often remarkably pure, so much so that there is no hesitation to collect many specimens under the same number. Such is the case for instance with 0. parva on the lower St. Lawrence and with 0. parviflora on the sands of Lake St. John. 0. angustissima var. quebecensis of Cape Tourmente is also unmistakable. The case of Oenothera parallels that of Crataegus. It is not rare, in the Montreal district, to see in the same neglected pasture, a good half-dozen Hawthorn species, perfectly distinct in May-June when floral characters are available. I agree with Gates "that the activities of man during the last three cen-</page><page sequence="15">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 503 turies in eastern Canada have given opportunity for their (Oenotherae) spread which did not exist when -the country was mainly forested. The clear- ing of forests, cultivation and other soil disturbances by man have probably led to collisions between forms which were formerly isolated from each other. Although natural crossing is apparently unusual among the forms, yet it does occur. Owing to the catenations, such hybrids will breed true and will con- stitute in some cases new species or types generally intermediate between the parents." To sum up, although the matter is as yet much involved, I think we can place Oenothera side by side with Crataegus as another wholesale case of discontinuous evolution. All this suggests a very important and rather unexpected generalization: that under favorable circumstances, a period of two or three hundred years is sufficient to produce, in some genera at least, by mutation or otherwise, a mar- velous outburst of species, or at any rate, of recognizable forms. So much for these definite traces of discontinuous evolution. As a general rule, such biological advances or regressions whose relation with the previous static condition is obscure, are actually referred to a more traditional mode of evolution which we consider, or at least call, continuous, perhaps simply because the number and affinity of the terms in line conceal their discontinuity. We are thus led to study another series of facts illustrating the appar- ently continuous changes which have affected vegetation since its first appear- ance on the planet Earth. There is such a thing as Plant Sociology., Plants behave amazingly like human beings. They are born, they live, they die. They associate for com- mon good such as the myriads of individuals of Betula populifolia that spring- on our abandoned fields. Very often different species come in contact and compete for ground, as e.g. when the Conifers invade the Birch forma- tion. Generally, having competed long enough, one foe subdues the other, or they both agree to differ, and a climax, which is essentially an equilibrium. is reached. Aggregation and association are, as a rule, beneficial to most species. Isola- tion, on the other hand, is a two-edged sword. Although instrumental in bringing about evolutionary advances, it often also leads to regression and extinction. It should be relatively easy to reduce to cases of isolation the bulk of the species constituting what I have ventured to call the alldgenous flora of east- tern Canada. Although the matter is much more involved, it will be suffi- cient to study here two major agencies of plant isolation and extinction that have acted upon the Canadian flora. A great event in the recent geological history of North America was the</page><page sequence="16">504 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST gradual disappearance during Tertiary times of the North Atlantic land- bridge which, bordered to the south by the old Thetys sea, had linked America with Europe since Cambrian times (Fig. 12). The sinking or drifting of the land must have been gradual, but when completed, the cold currents rushed southward, wind and insects could no longer brinlg about cross-pollination between plants of the now widely separate areas, and in general, ecological conditions became more and more different from one side of the Atlantic to the other. WORTH4 ATLANTIC CONTINENT Fig. 12. Continental land-bridge over the North Atlantic Ocean during Tertiary times (Eocene). These conditions brought about the disruption, divergence and independent evolution of the floras of northeastern America and northwestern Europe, up to this moment remarkably similar, owing to land continuity and uniform climate. Thus we note the extinction in Europe of very remarkable present-day American trees such as the White Pine (Pinus Strobus), the Tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera), the Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum), the Black Walnut (Juglans nigra), the Hickory (Carya alba), the Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), the Red Maple (Acer rubrum). Very typical in this respect is the general distribution of the genus Tsuga in the northern hemisphere, with its present four widely separated areas, and the sites of Central Europe where Tertiary remains of our own eastern American Hemlock have been found.</page><page sequence="17">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 505 On the other hand, America loses interesting elements such as the Water Chestnut (Trapa natans). Other present-day European or Greenland plants such as Phyllitis Scolopendrium, Atriplex maritima, Sparganium glomeratum, Habenaria albida, Polygonum acadiense, Carex Hostiana, Hieracium groen- landicum are extremely localized and sometimes on the verge of extinction on the American side of the Atlantic. This group of common European plants now almost extinct here, and holding their own only in rare spots around the Gulf of St. Lawrence, is per- haps best illustrated by the geographical record of a rare Sedge, Carex Hosti- ana, named after a famous student of grass plants, Nicholas Thomas Host. Years of painstaking exploration have revealed a peculiar local distribu- tion: along the coast of western Newfoundland and southern Anticosti, sug- gesting a former continuous shore-line or continental shelf (Fig. 13). But the gcneral distribution (Fig. 14) is even of greater interest, for it tells a wonderful tale of former continuity and confirms in its own way the youthful character of the northern Atlantic Ocean. This tale of continuity can also be told vice versa, since common American plants are known to persist as relics in Scandinavia or on the Baltic (Botrychium virginianum, Stellaria longipes, Montia lamprosperma, Carex marina, etc.), in the British Isles (Sisyrinchium angustifolium, Spiranthes Romanzoffiana, Eriocaulon sep- tangulare, Juncus macer) and elsewhere (Naias flexills, Galium trifidum, Spar- tina alterniflora, Spartina patens, etc.) Carex /o-5otiana (var.

Local distribution on the Gulf of St. Lawrence of Carex Hostiana var. aurentiana, suggesting a former continuous shore-line.</page><page sequence="18">506 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST It should be stated at this point that though a great number of woody and herbaceous species disappeared on one or the other sides of the Atlantic following the separation of the two continents, most of the tree genera sur- vived. Their species, however, gradually modified by long isolation, have come to diverge in such a way that, in most cases, the American tree can no longer be regarded as conspecific with the European. It is of importance to note that in the present-day flora, northeastern America and northwestern Europe, although having in the main the same characteristic tree types, have not a single species in common, the only debat- able exception being the Juniper (Juniperus communis), which however, in the whole of North America assumes a habit (var. depressa, var. megistocarpa, etc.) quite different from that of the familiar upright European form. But the same evolutionary factor, isolation, acting in roughly similar con- Fig. 14. Generalized range of Carex HostiaUia (sensu amplo) showing the persist- ence of a small disrupted area about the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a remarkable condi- tion correlated with the disappearance of the North Atlantic land-bridge. ditions of environment on both sides of the Atlantic, was bound to produce parallel specific differences. Such is actually the case. For very many com- mon American trees and shrubs, particularly of the Alleghanian region, there is a parent species abroad, the two formintg an evident and closely related pair. The relationship can easily be demonstrated for the Beeches, the Birches, some of the Pines, the Hornbeams, the Elms, etc. Indeed the Iron-wood (Ostrya virginiana) is but the American phase of Ostrya carpinifolia of Europe. The divergence is actually so slight that the two might be considered as conspecific, according to certain standards. The Slippery Elm (Ulmus fulva) of America forms a pair with the English Elm (Ulmus campestris), and our magnificent American Elm (Ulmus americana) is but the New World improved replica of Ulmus pedunculata of Europe. Pubescence only differentiates members of striking pairs of species, such as our Sorbus americana and Sorbus Aucuparia of Europe. In the Conifer series a like relation can perhaps be established between the Jack Pine (Pinus Banksiana) and the Scotch Pine (Pinus sylvestris), as well</page><page sequence="19">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 507 as between our Laurentian White Pine (Pinus Strobus) and the Balkan Pine (Pinus Peuce). Numerous notable pairs of species, telling the same story of divergent micro-evolution, could be listed among shrubs and herbaceous plants such as: Viburnum Lantana and Viburnum lantanoides, Viburnum Opulus and Vibur- num trifidum, Sambucus racemosa and Sambucus pubens, Lonicera coerulea and Lonicera villosa, Oxalis Acetosella and Oxalis montana, Circaea lutetiana EQU15ETUM PALUSTRE TYPE VAP.

Almost any careful intra-specific analysis of admittedly circumboreal species confirms this bicentric micro-evolutionary trend. For instance isolation has not left untouched the common Horsetails of the northern hemisphere. Equisetum sylvaticum of Europe has the base of the branches scabrous, while it is essentially glabrous in most North American plants. The teeth of European E. palustre and its American representative show an average difference in length and margin. The endemic tendency of the American E. hyemale (E. hyemale var. affine) towards a single row of tubercles on the stem ridges, has lontg been known and acknowledged (Fig. 15). It seems that this bicentric micro-evolution has been so general that we may well accept the phytogeographical law proposed by Fernald: "Species which in America are confined chiefly to the Alleghanian region will be found to differ in very fundamental characters from their nearest allies of continental Europe." The gradual disappearance of the North Atlantic land-bridge and the -assumption that the process seems to have progressed from the south north- ward, offers a satisfactory explanation for a certain number of surprising floristic facts. For instance, the Heaths (Erica spp.) may have missed Amer- ica by a few million years because, travelling a long way from their South African center of dispersal, they did not reach northern Europe in time to "use the bridge."' Only because the breaking off of the hyperboreal land-masses is so recent, can the holarctic flora be so homogeneous. As we go south, neo-paleoboreal differentiation increases, as it were, in concentric rings, and indeed also local differentiation. In a very pertinent paper on Quebec Astragalus, Rousseau has pointed out a striking example of biological segregation within the group of A. alpinus (sensu amplo), seemingly by successive north-south migratory waves and ultimate entrenchments in isolated river basins. The varieties of Tanacetum huronense (var. johannense, var. bifarium) described by Fernald point to the same series of phenomena. A similar process of differentiation, but mainly in a west to east direction, characterizes the whole group of crossopetalous Gentians. They seem to have radiated eastward from a Cordilleran center of dispersal, losing momentum as they went! Of the six Cordilleran species: Gentiana ventricosa, G. Macounii. G. tonsa, G. elegans, G. simplex, G. barbellata, only the first two reach Hud- son Bay where they contact the western limit of G. nesophila. Then appears the midcontinental G. procera and the eastern G. crinita; then the endemic northeastern G. Victorinii and G. gaspensis, and again on the Gulf of St.</page><page sequence="21">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 509 Lawrence the bicentric G. nesophila, and finally in Greenland and northern Europe G. serrata. What does this fascinating story of distribution really mean? (Fig. 16). But another great geological event, bound to have a decisive bearing on the future evolution of the Canadian flora is now at hand. At the close of the Tertiary, the flora and fauna of boreal America are again submitted to the great ordeal of glaciation, a mass phenomenon which preceding eras had also witnessed as the Ordovician tillites of eastern Quebec clearly show. The causes and modus operandi of the Great Glaciation do not concern us here. The subject has received a very able treatment in the hands of notable geologists, particularly Professor A. P. Coleman of Toronto and W. B. Wright in England. It is enough to recall that at this period, an immense sheet of ice, endowed with tremendous mechanical force overran everything in its advance, covering at times two million square miles of territory, stretching from Labrador to Alaska, descending as far as Montana, with a wedge into the valleys of Mississippi and Ohio, and reaching the Atlantic in northern New Jersey. This sheet of ice seems to have radiated from three centers: Labradorian, Keewatinian and Cordilleran (Fig. 17). In the course of the round million of years of this long Ice Age, there were movements of advance and retreat, with interglacial periods between. During these recurrent interludes the climate became again temperate, and the vegetation, previously pushed to the south, returned to its former home. Fig. 16. Distribution of a group of enclemic crossopetalous Gentians of north- eastern America, with special reference to the bicentric range of C. nesophila.</page><page sequence="22">510 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST Thus we have the momentous picture of "great hosts of plants oscillating between the poles and the equator, their ranks thinning by the friction attend- ant on their movement, which has extinguished perhaps whole battalions" (Thiselton-Dyer). The penultimate return of the ice, at the so-called Jerseyan period, seems to have covered the whole of the St. Lawrence valley, and to have destroyed all vegetation therein. Then opened an interglacial period that may have lasted sixty or eighty thousand years. We know something of the flora of this last interglacial epoch, from the scanty fossil remains which have been found on the Moose River, near James Bay; in Toronto at Scarboro Bluffs and in the Valley of the Don River (Fig. 18). The Toronto deposits have furnished forty-two species of plants indicating a climate equivalent to that of present-day Penn- sylvania. Some of these plants such as Sassafras (Sassafras variifolia) are still living a little farther south, others such as Acer torontoniensis and Acer pleistocenicum have become extinct (Fig. 19). Acer pleistocenicum may have been identical with the Norway Maple (Acer platanoides) planted in our parks and streets. Possibly a common tree in the St. Lawrence valley during the last interglacial period, it became extinct here but was preserved in northern Europe. This much we know of the interglacial floras by the records of Toronto clays. But we think we know much more from living documents, from a relic G3REENLAND C CE SHEEAT Z ui KEEWATIN 4 IOCE SHET LA Fig. 17.

The last interglacial period draws to a close. The climate becomes once more very cold, again the ice rushes south, and we have the last or Wisconsin glacial period. The ice covers the country, but it now seems apparent from the work of Coleman and Alcock, supplemented by the work of a group of botanists inspired by Fernald, that this final offensive was not very severe in Eastern America, and that many high spots and possibly strips of the lowland were left untouched. These high spots, these nunataks as they are now called from an Eskimo word, we visualize either as green oases or barren islands on the white horizons of this strange period. Were the nunataks lost in the expanse of this most Fig. 18. Scarboro Bluffs (Toronto, Ont.), showing the enormous accumulation of glacial and interglacial deposits now battered by the waves of Lake Ontario. (Photo Marie-Victorin). complete of deserts, absolutely deprived of life? They are supposed, and here the relic theory comes in, to have sheltered an interesting, though greatly impoverished flora, made up of sturdy species saved from the ice and bound to adapt themselves to a new and violently different environment. Is this but an imaginative bit of paleo-phytogeography? How do we know all that? The botanists of the last 25 years have gradually discovered, listed and organized into an impressing factual body a rather large number of allo- genous elements more or less interwoven with the fundamental flora of north- eastern America. The area where most of these allogenous elements are found coincides in the main with the non-glaciated lands of Wisconsin times. We are naturally led to infer that our living allogenous flora is a survivor of an important and now largely extinct flora cornered on the nunataks during the Wisconsin glaciation. It is important to point out here that the elimination of the less plastic</page><page sequence="24">5 1 2 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST forms of life, allowing room for the expansion of the more plastic and pro- gressive forms, may have been one of the most efficient factors in the evolution of new species, and may have accelerated pre-existing evolutionary trends. I have just hinted that the districts where the allogenous elements, endemic or epibiotic, are distributed, coincide so clearly with the districts which the Fig. 19.

Coleman).</page><page sequence="25">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 513 the geologists have successively and more or less reluctantly pronounced as unglaciated, that it was very natural to correlate the two. The idea gains momentum by the fact that a parallel condition exists in northwestern Europe. It is agreed amongst geologists, that the Great Baltic Glacier, nearly syn- chronous with the American Wisconsin, did not invade the northernmost borders of Norway, western Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and a portion of Iceland. Fernald has pointed out that at least one hundred species which are restricted in America to areas not covered by Wisconsin ice, occur likewise in Europe in areas which were not covered by the Baltic Glacier. Fair samples of this flora are Epilobium latifolium, Lomatogonium rotctum, Polygonum acadiense, Atriplex maritima and Scirpus pumilus. The last case is extremely demonstrative, Scirpus pumilus being known only by three stations on the extreme northern border of Norway left out by the Great Baltic Glacier. Of course I know that linking thus the allogenous flora of northeastern America with glacial and interglacial phenomena is open to certain objections. When the theory was proposed and expounded by Fernald, almost twenty-five years ago, it became at once very popular among American botanists and was Fig. 20. The supposed nunataks (in solid black) of northeastern Canada.</page><page sequence="26">514 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST supposed to cover and explain all the facts of endemism and isolation. But time has passed and data have accumulated. Doubts have been persistently ex- pressed as to the absolute value of the theory. In my own work in the Mingania-Anticosti district, I have brought in line a number of facts that can not easily be reconciled with the strict nunatak explanation. But, for the sake of exposition, an imperfect order is no doubt better than none at all, so that for the time being, it seems preferable to retain the main lines of Fernald's hypothesis, notwithstanding its weak sides, which will be exposed further on. We have then a number of regions, centering about the Gulf of St. Law- rence, that presumably did escape the sheet of ice of the Wisconsin period (Fig. 20). The unglaciated districts were mainly the Tomgat Mountains of Labrador, Western Newfoundland, the Magdalen Islands, certain parts of Cape Breton Island, the Shikshok Mountains and some cliffs of Gaspe, and certain small areas: Le Bic, Tourelle, St.-Urbain, Twin Islands, etc. As an introduction to the topographical aspect of unglaciated regions, Mount Albert, of the Shikshok Mountains of Gasp', is as good as any other. An impressive table-land, four thousand feet high, evidently a bit of the Cretaceous peneplain uplifted during Tertiary times; deep valleys; scanty vegetation; clear, icy brooks; herds of cariboos roaming the upland pastures. Table-Top Mountain, also in the Shikshok range, is separated from Mount Albert by the deep valley of Sainte-Anne River. It is slightly higher than Mount Albert, and much more extensive. The surface consists of loose blocks of the underlying granitic rock, seldom showing any displacement. No striated surfaces and no boulder clays are found there. A quite typical unglaciated mountain top. Fig. 21. Shikshok Mountains of Gaspe, seen from the summit of Mt. Albert. (Photo Marie-Victorin).</page><page sequence="27">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 515 When one stands on the summit of Mount Albert, the Shikshoks roll before the eyes in huge endless waves (Fig. 21). It is a wild, rugged, unfriend- ly, soulless country, some parts of which are yet unmapped. But its flora has been for the last twenty-five years the lure of field botanists and plant- geographers in northeastern America. In fact, only a very small group of men, mostly geologists and botanists, can claim any knowledge of that coun- try. Since every bit of exploration brings unexpected additions to the flora, I suspect that when this territory will be completely explored, the sharp con- trast between the floristic catalogues of Eastern and Western America will be done with. To the unglaciated areas now officially recognized as such by geologists must be added tentatively, and only from the testimony of its allogenous flora, a part at least of the limestone shelf, formerly running along the North Shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and that can be termed an "avant-pays," a foreland. This shelf has crumbled or sunk in the sea, leaving only Mingania (the Mingan Archipelago) and Anticosti, lands of mystery which, though prob- ably glaciated during the Wisconsin, present the biological characteristics gen- erally associated with unglaciated regions. All these narrowly limited districts supposedly preserved, during the Wis- consin giaciation, a part of the vegetation which covered them during .he preceding interglacial period. This vegetation seems to have had great affini- ties with the present Rocky Mountain flora, and, to a lesser degree, with the flora of subarctic and arctic Europe. It has been postulated that the inter- glacial flora ran uniform from the Rockies to the Atlantic and that the Wis- consin advance obliterated all vegetation between these two points, save in limited and isolated spots (Great Lakes, James Bay, Gulf of St. Lawrence) thereby cutting off these nunatak floras from the Rocky Mountain flora, and setting in action the evolutionary machine of geographical and biological isola- tion. But this interpretation probably needs closer critical study. The whole supply of water vapor being imprisoned in Wisconsin Ice, the nunataks and the long belt bordering the ice-front were as is likely dry, barren, and steppe-like. We can to day visualize these conditions in some parts of Mingania and Anticosti. Ile Nue, for instance, opposite Longue-Pointe de Mingan, is liable to impress the visiting botanist who bears this ancient history in mind. It is neither a sedge-grass semi-halophytic prairie, nor a bird-rock with its attend- ant nitrophilous flora. It is rather a slightly raised tundra with a weird row of erosion monoliths towering, in Easter Island fashion, all around the rim of the island. The tundra lies on flat, creviced limestone strata insur- ing a most efficient drainage which rules out tree growth and creates even in this damp climate intense xerophytism (Fig. 22). Most woody plants of Ile Nue possess a powerful underground system, but their prostrate aerial parts crawl over Polytrichums and Cladonias.

Standing a little over these, in damp places, are Viburnum pauciflorum, the Cordilleran Betula microphylla, the northern Amelanchier Bartramiana, and a strange form of Acer spicatum, in leaf-shape similar to A. rubrum. But here, as almost every- where in Mingania, obscure events in the biological sequence have left living traces, and we cannot but wonder at such unexpected plants as the claret- flowered Streptopus oreopolus, the enigmatic yellow Draba minganensis, and the Rocky Mountain Cypripedium passerinum. As has already been intimated in a general way, such conditions as those prevalent on Ile Nue and other parts of Mingania-Anticosti eliminate certain species, clear the ground for others, and open new possibilities of adaptation and evolution. The two thousand mile ice-front we are visualizing in Wiscon- sin time, with its equable ecological conditions, may have been an important highway for the eastward migration of Cordilleran plants. But we will see later that this explanation of the occurrence of many of the so-called Cordil- leran plants in the east is not the only one possible. During hundreds of centuries, the ice surrounds the nunataks and this evolution goes on. With the final recession of the ice, the Laurentian Shield, left burdened with a heavy mantle of drift and with endless moraines, the St. Lawrence valley, and the whole of northeastern America are definitively col- onized by an essentially young, aggressive, and uniform type of vegetation,</page><page sequence="29">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 517 which finds its most perfect expression in the present flora of the Laurentide Mountains. The leading botanical traits of this flora are its ecological diversity, its floristic uniformity and its lack of local endemics. Any hundred square miles repeat the plant units and the plant associations of the whole region (Fig 23). And now we imagine the aggressive types of the so-called Canadian Spruce forest coming up north, striding over moraines and ice-polished slopes, sur- rounding the nunataks and invading those secluded rock-gardens of the past.

In America at least, there was no frowning Macbeth on the wall to watch Birnam woods coming up to Dunsinane! But, nevertheless on and on came the "moving groves"! First came those ever ready pioneers: the Black Spruce and the White Spruce (Figs. 24 and 25), and the Balsam Fir, and the Larch, and later the stately Pines. Then followed the Aspens and the Birches, the Alders and Vibumums, the Dogwoods and Vacciniums.

(Photo Marie-Victorin).</page><page sequence="32">520 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST Frere Cleon-que-Joseph, in an unusually interesting paper, visualizes this re-invasion of the Canadian country as a combined effect of three definite conditions: low ecological pressure (or ecological depression) in the recently ice-freed territory, youthful character of the soil, and progressive improvement in climate. He also emphasizes, or rather demonstrates, the part played by the lakes in the accumulation, conservation, and organization of the actual Laurentian phytomosaic. Following the recession of the ice, the re occupation of the immense rejuvenated territory got under way at a rhythm which bene- fited of the unique ecological conditions of the time, and of the great differ- ence of ecological pressure between the non-glaciated territory to the south teeming with life, and the still barren drift-covered area to the north. The latter, owing to numberless moraines (Fig. 28) and glacial damming was dotted with innumerable lakes. These lakes, large or small, ripped the contnuity of the marchina coniferous or deciduous forest, and broke the Fig. 29. Lake Ste.

In allowing unlimited overlapping of specific ranges, in providing convenient homes on the lake shores for a host of light-loving plants and for a multitude of hydrophytes, the great network of lake-and-stream system was instrumental in enriching the flora without altering its homogeneous character (Fig. 29). At the present period, while the ice is perhaps still retreating to the north, the main forest groups keep in order of march. The northern conifer forest leads, impressive in its simplicity and its enduring likeness in all seasons, for there is no winter for the Spruce needle and for the Lichen on the bark. Four species (Picea glauca, P. mariana, Abies balsamea, Betula papyrifera) domi- nate this vast mossy forest floor, with their millions of millions of short- lived and small-sized individuals. South of this limit is developed a puzzlinga</page><page sequence="33">-PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 521 and less simple forest group that can be called "Eastern Hemlock Region" (Nichols), where conifer areas, hardwood areas, and various mixtures of both, make a transition to the highly complex deciduous forest to the south, almost entirely made up of large-sized and long-lived broad-leaved trees. If now we go back to the old species nesting on the nunataks, we picture that since forty-odd thousand years perhaps, they wage a losing fight against the sturdy northern conifers and their natural ecological associates. It seems too much for them. Through ecological pressure or through the failure of some essential biological processes, intrinsic or extrinsic, the old species have already surrendered most of the ground. They are mostly very local, some of them extremely so, being confined to one mountain-top, some- times to one definite crevice of a particular mountain, or to one secluded cove by the seashore. How localized are now these alleged preglacial plants is well-known to all botanists who have done field-work in this part of the world. But this fact can be visualized mathematically by glancing at the calculations patiently made by Fernald in view of opposing the general application of Willis' "Age and Area" theory. Fernald considers as members of the ancient flora of Gaspe "the species which to-day occur upon the unglaciated mountains above the 2000-foot level (the upper limit of general glaciation) and which are not in the arctic and subarctic regions to the north." The ranges of the indigenous plants of Gaspe peninsula were derived by Fernald from daily records during many seasons, of all plants seen or collected in every township, river system, lake and mountain area, by himself and his associates. Few floristical inventories have ever been so thorough. Belowv are some of the results. The "old" species show no tendency to occupy the whole length of the Gaspe lobe, although the moun- tain range forming the backbone of the peninsula would help them to do so. Their average longitudinal dispersion is 0.45% (as compared with 0.72%O for 'the common "young" flora). In Salix the figure drops to a low of 0.29%, while in the Grasses a maximum of 0.54% is reached. The cold figures of course lend a mathematical certainty to the case, but they are even less im- pressive than the many individual cases when the known distribution is reduced to one, or very few definite and limited stations. To-day, only the trained eye of the professional botanist can see that the nunataks, although seemingly continuous with the rest of the country, are still physiologically insular, that they are centers of endemism where, with the delicate instrument of morphological and cytological analysis, we can detect the flow and beat of organic evolution. Such is the biological epic one can put up on the theme of the nunatak theory. Must we include this epic in the body of North American phyto- geographical knowledge, or must we settle down to a less romantic genesis for the allcdgenous flora of northeastern America? The local endemics or relics forming the bulk of the allogenous and seem-</page><page sequence="34">522 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST ingly vanishing flora of northeastern America have received much study for the last thirty years in the hands of a group of United States and Canadian bot- anists. It is now time to introduce a number of these allogenous species. Their various peculiarities will, I hope, convey an abstract of the geological and biological problems involved. Let us go back to Mount Albert. Ascending to the top, we alight on a level treeless serpentine tableland, about ten square miles. It is a kind of roofless Noah's ark preserving a host of preglacial plants. Here again, the loose rocks, congeneric with the substratum, are character- istic of unglaciated spots, and the botanists can collect to their heart's content in these almost moon-like surroundings. Beyond the "Coulee des Neiges" snow fields often persist during the summer (Fig. 30). Although the place seems barren, a recital of the flora under view would include a rich list of alpine and arctic plants, of relics and local endemics. Fig. 30. Unglaciated top of Mt. Albert, showing loose serpentine roceks amongst which grow Adiantum pedatum var. a'eulicum, Polystichum mo/hrioides var. scopulinum, Pellaea densa, Festuca scabrella, etc. In the background a snow field photographed on August 9th, 1923.

The great interest of the plant lies in its almost entirely Cordilleran distribution, Mount Albert being the only station for it in easter America. Adiantum pedatum var. aleuticum, Pellaea densa and Festuca scabrella, the three of them also typical Cordilleran serpentine plants, are other characteristic elements which however occur also at very low altitude in the serpentine belt of southemr Quebec.

Scores of other allogenous elements make a precarious living all along this bleak rocky shore of northern Gaspe peninsula as far west as Le Bic. Le Bic is famous for its endemics and relics: Arabis pendulocarpa, Nymphaea tetra- gona, Ranunculus lapponicus, Draba minganensis, Botrychium minganense, Woodsia oregana, Rosa Williamsii, Erigeron compositus var. mutifidus, etc. Now we cross the entire Gasp6 peninsula to Perce, equally famous as a summer resort and as a geological riddle. There Perce Rock with its millions of Devonian fossils stands in the light, having for background, a few miles off-shore, the sheer red conglomerate cliffs of Bonaventure Island, teeming with bird-life. Mt. Ste.-Anne at Perce harbors a very remarkable group of endemics and relics such as Thelypteris Filix-mas, Draba pycnosperma, Erigeron com- positus var. multifidus, Botrychium minganense, Saxifraga oppositifolia, Anten- naria gaspensis, Oxytropis jobannensis, Salix vestita, Amelanchier gaspensis, A rnica chionopappa, and others. We land on Bonaventure Island. A hanging rock about six feet square represents an important part of the entire kingdom of Draba pycnosperma, the rest of the known distribution being the near-by conglomerates on top of Mt. Ste.-Anne, one station at Tourelle, and one in northwestern Newfoundland. If we travel now along Baie des Chaleurs, and botanize on the river gravels,</page><page sequence="39">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 527 we find a complete mixture of the old allegedly interglacial elements and of the young aggressive Canadian flora. The old elements are not all at high altitudes. In fact, most of them are exclusively at very low levels, sometimes near the sea, such as Draba glabella var. megasperma, Dryas Drummondii, Astragalus gaspensis, Astragalus eucos- mus, Lathyrus nevadensis (Fig. 35) and Listera borealis. In the hypothesis of a mountain or nunatak origin, all these would have to be considered as having abandoned their former homes and migrated to the river gravels under the pressure of the sturdy denizens of the Canadian Spruce forest. This is a good sample of that anthropomorphic ecology that has crept surreptitiously in our minds, and is acceptable only on the ground that all living beings have much in common. Here is evidently a weak point in the theory as will be seen further on. The marshes at the mouth of the Bonaventure River are apparently a commonplace habitat but, however, they treasure most interesting relics (Fig. Fig. 36. Estuary of the Bonaventure River, Baie des Chaleurs, Que.. to this day the only known locality for the endemic Gentiana gaspernsis. (Photo Marie-Victorin). 36). For instance we have here one of the few stations in continental Quebec for the coastal plain Rose (Rosa virginiana). But far more interesting is Gentiana gaspensis, a frail monocarpic plant, and a relative of the well-known Fringed Gentian, growing among common- place grasses and sedges. It has not been found outside of this particular marsh where it can be reached easily from the highway, an unfortunate possi- bility that may eventually lead to its complete extinction. The organography of Gentiana gaspensis is quite typical of the whole crossopetalous group of Gentians, so well defined by their tetramerous corolla (Fig. 37).</page><page sequence="40">5128 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST We have here a fascinating group of plants, interesting in itself, and par- ticularly so, as we have seen above, in its relations with the phytogeographical problems of eastern Canada.

Gentiana Vic- torinii is locally abundant, and in no danger of extinction, as can be seen on the tidal flats at Cap-Rouge, near the Quebec Bridge, where the plant blooms plentifully by the middle of August. Perhaps an abridged sequence of the several stages involved in the pro- fessional search for relic species will be of interest here. I will illustrate this process by the narrative of the discovery and study of a new Aster of the Gaspe region: Aster gaspensis, (Fig. 38). There we are, on the swift Bonaventure River, poling our Gaspe boat, a craft built specially for these shallow and rapid salmon rivers. Setting foot on a gravel flat, roughly twelve miles from the sea, our attention is drawn to a clump of a beautiful sky-blue Aster. To an eye armed with a lens and trained in the complexities and endless variations of Asters, this clump pre- sents nevertheless an unusual feature. The distinctive shape of the bracts under the heads, makes it sure that nothing of the kind has been seen as yet by human eye in eastern America. We are again confronted with an unde- scribed plant of Cordilleran affinity isolated in the east, and we proceed to the preparation of specimens in the old usual way, which has been so little im- proved since the days of Tournefort and Linnaeus. Then we inquire about its local distribution, and we gather the unexpected fact that it is spread out only on a stretch of about three miles of gravel: from the twelfth to the fifteenth mile. 5AIEP C]{ALEVR5. Aster 6aspensis Fig. 39. Range of the endemic Aster gaspensis, suggesting the possibility of a migration along an old shore-line.</page><page sequence="43">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 531 Later explorations have shown that the same situation obtains in the bed of other rivers draining the same basin: Grande Riviere, Petit-Pabos, Grand- Pabos, etc., so that an interrupted zone of this allogenous Aster seems to run parallel to the sea-shore at a distance of several miles (Fig. 39). With nu- merous collections now at hand, our concept of Aster gaspensis has somewhat evolved. Although remaining distinct from the Aster longifolius and the Aster foliaceus alliances, Aster gaspensis, as described, happens to be also, at the present time, a dynamic center of variation. These three species seem on the upgrade, while so many other relics behave as though they were sliding into extinction. During the winter months, time will be given to the detailed study of the plant, to careful drawing and listing of characters, and to a discussion of its identity. The search for identity will be made by borrowing from the large herbaria of America their collections of Cordilleran Asters. From compara- tive study it will then become evident that the Gaspe plant belongs to a sec- tion of the genus characterized by the wide subequal bracts of the head, a section hitherto unknown in eastern America. The Cordilleran affinity of the Aster under study invites to map the dis- tribution of the section Fulcrati of the genus, thus showing beautifully one of those neat cases of geographical isolation that have led, for good or otherwise, to the proposal of the nunatak theory (Fig. 40). I have as yet avoided the most difficult part of the problem. I refer to the endemics and relics of the Mingania-Anticosti district. Fig. 40. Aster (Sect Fuicrati).

Erosion witnesses (flower-pots) on Niapisca Island (Mingania). Tree vegetation made up mainly of Picea glauca. (Photo Marie-Victorin). Mingania and Anticosti are closely connected geographically, geologically and biologically. They were a part of a shelf running along the north shore of the Gulf to Blanc-Sablon and Newfoundland. At a later stage the two lands were forming a peninsula protruding into the Gulf. Ultimately the isthmus crumbled and disappeared, leaving in its place the shallow Mingan Channel. Physiographically, according to Twenhofel, the Mingania-Anticosti prov- ince is made up of the unsubmerged summits of three cuestas, of which two form Mingania and the third Anticosti. The channel between Mingania and Anticosti is due to the erosion accomplished by two "fossil" streams whose divide extended from North Point, on Anticosti, to Perroquet Island. The larger of the islands of Mingania are beautifully terraced, but it is not known when the major outlines of the terraces were formed. As regards glaciation, quoting Twenhofel's words, "the ice-sheet seems to have covered every one of the islands as shown by grooves, striae, and erratics." Mingania includes twenty-two islands, large or small, all of them con- sisting entirely of undisturbed limestones gently inclined southward. The islands fringe the north shore of the Gulf for about 75 miles. The contrast with the nearby Precambrian mainland is very sharp, both in lithological and biological elements, except for some points of the mainland where Mingania strata are exposed. The scenery in Mingania is very impressive. Erosion has carved the rocks into fantastic shapes. The so-called "flower-pots" of Niapisca, Grande Ile, Ile a la Proie, Ile Nue are sights not easily forgotten. On Niapisca, for instance, can be seen one of the strangest objects left in</page><page sequence="45">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 533 this land by the chisel of Time: in a lonely inlet, three grim stately towers crowned with northern flowers (Fig. 41). Nearby, Ile a la Proie has a rock table submerged at high tide, with a row of giant urns, rusty pilasters, and stelas. On Grande Ile, another weird display of fantastic gargoyles, rock caprices, and totem-like pillars. This topography has sometimes been inter- preted as an indication of a nunatak area. That is probably going too far. According to Twenhofel the "flower-pots" must be attributed to wave action. Wind action of course produces similar forms, but here the flower- pots are often in timber, and all are associated with seemingly post-glacial terraces. Compared with Mingania, Anticosti is much more extensive, but much less picturesque. The north side is a series of moderately high cliffs (Fig. 42), whereas the limestones slope gently on the south side, often supporting exten- sive bogs. Shallow rivers flow on a coarse marble pavement, or bore their way through heavy gravels, sometimes widening into estuaries. But however different physically, Mingania and Anticosti form but one biological province, very different from the mountainous Gaspe Peninsula barely fifty miles to the south, as well as from the nearby North Shore. The fundamental flora is made up of the subarctic Spruce forest, broken on Anti- costi by peat-bogs and numerous shallow lakes. The Spruce is rather small, and the White Spruce of Anticosti is quite peculiar, sometimes assuming at a distance a Hemlock-like habit (Fig. 43). An airplane view over northeastern Anticosti (Fig. 44) conveys an idea of the structure of this fundamental subarctic forest which is such as could be Fig. 42.

But mixed with the fundamental flora of Mingania- Anticosti are a number of unexpected allogenous elements of different taxo- nomic affinity, and presumably of different origin, which we cannot but con- sider as relics of the past, and which constitute a seemingly senescent flora. A complete recital of this allogenous flora would here be impossible, but the more characteristic elements can be cited: Draba glabella var. megasperma (Mingania-Anticosti), Draba laurentiana (Mingania), Botrychium mingan- ense (Mingania-Anticosti), Scirpus pumilus (Mingania-Anticosti), Hieraci- um groenlandicum (Anticosti), Erigeron lonchophyllus var. laurentianus (Min- gania-Anticosti), Gentiana nesophila (Mingania-Anticosti), Habenaria unala- schensis (Anticosti), Cirsium minganense (Mingania), Salix brachycarpa (Anticosti), Salix Bebbiana var. perrostrata (Mingania-Anticosti), Salix arctophila (Anticosti), Salix vestita (Mingania-Anticosti), Salix cordifolia (Mingania-Anticosti), Dryas Drummondii (Mingania), Erysimnum coarc- etatum (Mingania), Draba minganensis (Mingania), Hedysarum Mackenzii (Anticosti), Salix arctophila (Anticosti), Carex microglochin (Mingania- Anticosti), Solidago Victorinii and Solidago anticostensis (Anticosti), Arc- tostaphylos rubra (Mingania), Senecio plattensis (Anticosti), Taraxacum laurentianum (Mingania-Anticosti), Rumex fenestratus var. labradoricus (Anticosti), Lesquerella Purshii (Anticosti), Antennaria pulcherrima (Anti- costi), Braya humilis (Anticosti), etc. f. 0 5 10 15cm Fig. 45. Scirpus pumilus, an alpine but not arctic relic of the calcareous aravels of Mingania and Anticosti.</page><page sequence="48">536 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST Scirpus pumilus (Fig. 45) is a true alpine plant which, at the time of its discovery in Mingania, was known in America only from one distrusted col- lection made in Denver, Colorado, more than half a century ago. The local distribution as now known includes the Mingania tundras and the river gravels of Anticosti. The general distribution shows that it is essentially an alpine plant, but not really arctic or subarctic. It also shows extreme discontinuity. Its presence at sea-level, in eastern Quebec, is a far-reaching fact, and linked with numerous other instances, calls for a more or less important amendment to the nunatak theory (Fig. 46). No one would imagine that a bleak, barren Mingania sea-cliff could be the last refuge of Cypripedium passerinum, a familiar Orchid of the Pine woods Fig. 46.

In Mingania the plant grows among the Sphagnum and rank Sedges, in rock crevices exposed to the fury of the gales, or even on the gravel- spit by the seashore, within reach of the tide. A study of its distribution indicates that Cypripedium passerinum is a wide-ranging endemic Canadian species, but not really arctic. The extension of this Orchid to the Gulf of St. Lawrence might be, in the nunatak hypoth- esis, a good illustration of the universality during the last interglacial period of the present allogenous flora. But as in many other instances this distribu- tion can be explained otherwise. Of course the discovery of a new eastern Lady's Slipper is something event- ful enough in a field botanists's experience. But perhaps, the greatest thrill I ever experienced in the field was the discovery of the Mingania Thistle. Fig. 48. Cirsium minganense, an exclusive Minganian endemic, allied to a group (sect. Foliosae) of Cordilleran Thistles. Author standing by. (Photo Marie-Victorin).</page><page sequence="50">538 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST On a delightful evening of July 1924, my fishing boat, the "Virginia," thirty feet from bow to stern, had just reached for the night a secluded cove on Ile Quin, in Mingania. I went ashore to get a glimpse of the flora and to see what novelties could be had there. The tide was low, and I had to wade for some time amongst Laminarias before I could reach the limestone shingle and gravel, where, as a rule in this northern country, Elymus arenarius var. villosus, Senecio pseudo-Arnica and Lathyrus japonicus reign supreme. But there a great surprise was in store for me. Over these ubiquists of the seashore towered a plant no eastern botanist ever dreamed of. A dozen tall pale-green Thistles, 'ghostly and unreal, with pinkish heads clustered into a compact terminal mass surrounded and subtended by an elegant pseudo- verticil of long leafy bracts. This plant, evidently an undescribed species, I published later as Cirsium minganense (Fig. 48). In years of subsequent exploration it has been found that the Mingania Thistle does not exist in Gaspe, nor in Anticosti, nor in Newfoundland, but seems to be restricted to half a dozen definite seashore spots in the archi- pelago. My estimate is that actually there are not much more than a few hundred plants in existence. Now, if we examine the taxonomic characters of the Mingania Thistle, Fig. 49.

Figure 49 shows the general distribution of the group in western America, and the extraordinary geographical discontinuity of the relic eastern repre- sentative. Cnce more we note that around the Gulf of St. Lawrence, seemingly a majority of the relics congregate on the seashore, although the habitats of the identical or the nearly related plants of the Rockies are sometimes very differ- ent. Does the struggle for life ineluctably drive them here on the seashore where the ecological pressure of other species is lighter? Or else was the gravelly and fully-lighted seashore just a convenient pathway for their post- Pleistocene migrations in a thickly-forested country? Or are we dealing with an obscure equivalence of habitat? One must not overlook the fact that the Mingania Thistle, like all Thistles, Fig. 52. Airplane view of a portion of south central Anticosti Island, showing (left) the estuary of the Jupiter River and (riaht) South-West Point, localities famed for their allogenous elements.

Dr_as Drummondii, a Cordilleran relic, with Populus lacamahacca, both pioneering on the calcareous gravels of Petite-Cascapedia River, Gaspe Peninsula. (Photo Marie-Victorin). produces every year thousands of plumed seeds, scattered landward by the strong breezes of the Gulf (Fig. 50). Why then is the plant so restricted in its distribution? Why is it apparently dying away? And this is indeed no exceptional case. In the district under consideration, most very local species belong to families the seeds of which are provided with unusually effective means of dispersal. For instance the endemic Goldenrods of Anticosti, Solidago anticostensis and Solidago Victorinii, are recorded only from one or two stations (Fig. 51). Yet everybody knows how aggressive most Goldenrods are. Salix brachycarpa, so abundant in western America, is a relic in the East. Like all Willows, its seeds are produced abundantly and equipped with the regular tuft of cotton. Nevertheless this species is confined to the top of Mt. Albert in Gaspe, and to the gravels of Jupiter River and the neighboring low plateau on Anticosti. Such is the case for many other depressed species of willows (Fig. 52). Another case is Dryas Drummondii, also a relic species of eastern Canada. The light and mobile plumed fruits do not seem to be instrumental in extend- ing its distribution west of Mingania, Cap des Rosiers and the Little Casca- pedia River. The latter locality, from some obscure cause that may be linked with glaciation, acts as a western limit for quite a number of the Gulf of St. Lawrence endemics (Fig. 53). I could multiply the instances, and show that the sea-level relic flora of Anticosti and Mingania is fully as rich as that of the highlands of Gaspe and other reckoned unglaciated districts. But geologists seem to agree that the districts under consideration have been heavily laden with Wisconsin ice, and, moreover, have afterwards been submerged in Champlain times. These facts seem, on first examination, to oppose rather bluntly the</page><page sequence="54">542 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST 0.~~~~~ ANICOSTI Fig. 54.

How then can the peculiar flora of this district be accounted for? Painstaking exploration has revealed the astonishing situation shown in Fig. 54. The endemics and relics are crowded in Mingania, and along a shore approximately the same length on southern Anticosti. In the present state of science, and pending a more thorough geological and glaciological survey of the Mingania-Anticosti unit, I have suggested, on biological grounds only, the following hypothetical sequence. During the Tertiary or the early Pleistocene, migrations to Anticosti and Mingania, from northern Europe and perhaps from the Rockies, progressed along the then continuous limestone shelf bordering the north shore of the Gulf. Some of the older elements were not destroyed by the late or Wiscon- sin glaciation because they were shielded in the angle between flowing tongues or masses of ice on either side of Anticosti (Fig. 55). The Champlain sub- mergence was not as complete as has been thought and a relatively small number of the elements was not destroyed. The present distribution of Anti- costi relics seems to point to a place of refuge somewhere on a then higher land near the head-waters of the Chicotte and Vaureal rivers. The conditions on the dwindled Anticosti of Champlain times were something like open meadows, or gravel barrens, such as prevail even today in some part of the island: Sand-top, etc. (Fig. 56). With the gradual emersion of the land after the Champlain period, the Canadian Spruce forest invaded the open meadows, and the plants now listed as relics, such as Scirpus pumilus, Les- querella Purshii, Braya humilis, Arctostaphylos rubra, Hedysarum Mackenzii, and scores of others, unable to struggle with the sturdy Laurentian invaders, were gradually confined to the banks or gravels of the rivers, the only places where congenial or at least minimum conditions were left to most of them.

It now takes a trained eye to decipher through the meshes of the hypnaceous moss carpet of the Spruce forest the two phytogeographical stories silently told by the "lips" (the specific differ- ences here largely lie in this part of the flower) of Listera borealis, the Old one, and Listera cordata, the Newcomer! When all is said, the present relic flora represents only a small portion of an interglacial flora, the screenings, one may say, that have withstood the vicissitudes of the post-Pleistocene (Fig. 58). I have so far, for the sake of convenience, recounted the facts in connec- Fig. 57.

As will have been noticed, exception has been taken freely at certain points along the way, and certain doubts formulated as to the general application of the nunatak explanation. I might now declare more explicitly that after more than a quarter of a century of unusually good field work, of careful study of identities by able systematists, and of strenuous effort, constantly defeated however by more and more analysis, towards synthesis and integration, this whole chapter of plant geography should be rewritten. Wynne-Edwards, in a recent paper, has attempted to do so. His mnain points, if I read him correctly, are that we should get back to Hooker's classi- cal hypothesis, i.e.: "that the arctic-alpine flora of eastern North America has formed a single unit since pre-Wisconsin times; that in those times, it occupied suitable habitats in latitudes similar to, or higher than now; that with the advance of Wisconsin glaciation it was driven southwards and outwards; and finally that with the retreat of the ice a recolonization of the suitable habitats took place. The ecological differentiation associated with calcareous, mag- nesian, magnesian-calcareous and lime-soda soils . . . provides the key to the present disrupted ranges of these plants, without recourse to the question of survival in insulated unglaciated areas . . . Not all the soil-specialized species of the region have as yet had opportunity to reach all the suitable habitats, and some are found in this place, others in that place."</page><page sequence="58">546 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST Every experienced field-botanist knows of course the more or less exacting soil preferences of certain plants, and will agree, partly at least, with the statement made almost a century ago by a geologist, Sir William Dawson: 'For many of the plants of the Laurentide hills to extend themselves over the calcareous plains south of them, under any imaginable conditions of climate, is quite as far beyond the range of possibility as to extend across the wide ocean." But one cannot without danger reverse the statement, nor can one use safely the chemical explanation of distribution, except as applied to very gen- eral situations. Without re-opening a discussion that was the great ecological theme in pre-Warming days, it seems certain that some plants may be chemi- cally indifferent under certain conditions of latitude or climate, and calcicolous being given another set of conditions. For instance Acer nigrum, Ulmus racemosa, Celtis occidentalis, not distinctly calcicolous within their main areas, are almost exclusively so in southeastern Quebec where they reach their northern limit. And it so happens that many plants of rather indefinite pref- erence can maintain themselves in the north only by creeping on the lime- stones of Mingania, Anticosti and similar regions. Nothing is more illuminat- ing in this respect, than the observations made at the well-known British Ex- perimental Station of Rothamsted in 1929. The winter had been very severe and late frosts greatly damaged the experimental plots. Some of the plots had received annually for a number of years a supply of lime, whereas the adjacent plots were used as controls. On the untreated controls grass was - - o - , - -t' Fig. 59.

I have often thought that the xerothermic limestones of Mingania, Anti- costi, etc., can explain some general features of the flora, but that they are of little use in the search of an adequate solution to the individual problems of the so-called relic species. It will then be seen that we are here invited by Wynne-Edwards to come back to the simple faith we held forty years ago, prior to the period when the wealth of relic and endemic identities unearthed from year to year in Gaspe, Mingania-Anticosti, Newfoundland and other places, suggested a more com- plex history, and gave birth to the nunatak theory. For lack of personal acquaintance with certain parts of the territory such as Newfoundland, and for some other reasons as well, I am not ready at the present moment to enroll in extreme faiths and to undertake to rewrite myself this important chapter of plant geography. For the time being, I only want to point out some of the difficulties of the nunatak theory, and on the -~ X 'A- : M - Fig. 60. The "rainbow" explanation of the occurrence of the so-called Cordil- leran relics in northeastern America: both arctic and Cordilleran plants are arcto- Tertiary units that have migrated from their high arctic station (F) along the two main paths offered to them on either side of Hudson Bay. According to this view, the so-called Cordilleran plants would be just ancient arctic plants that have disappeared from the Arctic, and persisted at one or both ends (M and M') of their migrating trails.

Perhaps, one of the weakest points of Fernald's nunatak hypothesis, at least in the early statements, is the sharp distinction stressed or maintained between truly arctic and Cordilleran plants, the latter in the sense of plants having migrated from the Cordillera eastward in preglacial or interglacial times. The abandonment of this distinction would perhaps clarify the situation and strengthen the case. May not all, or most, of the plants concerned, be considered as arcto-tertiary plants having migrated from their high northern station along the two main paths offered to them on either side of Hudson's Bay? May not most of the so-called Cordilleran plants be just arctic migrants that for some reason or other have become extinct in the Arctic and have persisted at one or both ends of their migrating trails? (Fig. 60). This dynamic view of the situation, that could be labelled the "rainbow explanation," perhaps meets Wynne-Edward's statement (loc. cit. p. 10) which, however, refers only to the present static condition: "Some of these plants have wide limits of climatic tolerance, occurring through a wide lati- tudinal range, in which case their American distribution takes the form of an arch spanning the continent from the Cordillera to the St. Lawrence by way of the Arctic; while others are more narrowly confined, the hardiest occupying the crown of the arch and least hardy its two ends, whereby their ranges are disrupted into western and eastern centres." This hypothesis, not more imaginative or hazardous than the others, would explain in a very simple way not a few puzzling distributional maps. It would also take care of a number of future discoveries. Is it not evident that distributional maps showing striking disjunction and isolation rest mainly on negative evidence? It is obviously dangerous to speculate too freely on the absence of certain species in territories which are notoriously botanically unex- plored, such as the north shore of the Great Lakes, the Hudson Bay shores, the whole of northern Quebec and large sections of Gaspe and Newfoundland. The large number of so-called Cordilleran relics, or of endemics of Cor- dilleran affinity, which are found to-day at sea-level, either in apparently un- glaciated or obviously glaciated districts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence region, is another far-reaching fact that carries one away from the nunatak idea. Having chosen for my personal field-work Anticosti, Mingania, and the north shore of Baie des Chaleurs, I was no less successful in the search of allogenous elements, than the botanists of the same feather who concentrated on the highlands. There is no doubt for instance that the gravels of Little Cascapedia River, of Bonaventure River and other streams of the Baie des Chaleurs basin are richer in allogenous non-arctic elements (Aster gaspensis, Gentiana gaspensis, Astragalus gaspens's, Astragalus eucosmus, Lathyrus neva- densis, Dryas Drummondii, etc.) than the nearby Table-top Mountain. In this connection, one must not only think about very localized relics, but also about a number of bicentric species, rather general or frequent on the lower St. Lawrence: Zigadenus elegans, Juniperus horizontalis, Senecio pseudo-</page><page sequence="61">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 549 Arnica, Rumex persicarioides, Rumex pallidus, Poa eminens, Iris setosa var. canadensis, Aster angustus, etc. and whose Cordilleran or Asiatic affinity or identity must be accounted for. With these well-established facts in mind, one cannot refrain from think- ing that we have to consider not only sedentary relics that may not have migrated since scores of millenniums, but also a host of allogenous elements brought in as the result of migrations, presumably of several systems or waves of migration. A look at the map (Fig. 61) showing the Champlain Sea at its highest extension in northern Quebec suggests the possibility of a post-Pleistocene migration from James Bay to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along an almost con- tinuous seashore through northern Quebec. A botanical exploration following this physiographic line would perhaps bring surprising results. But we al- ready know, from the field work of Potter and others, a group of remarkable Fig. 61. Maximum marine invasion during the Champlain period, suggesting the possibility of a marine communication between the Champlain Sea and James Bay, and of plant migration along a continuous seashore.

The marine and estuarine elements of this bicentric group include: Bidens hyperborea, Carex norvegica, Juncus Gerardi, Poa eminens, Glaux maritima and others. But this biological relation between the two territories is even more strikingly exemplified by very local terrestrial plants such as the showy Antennaria pulcherrima (James Bay and Anticosti), Cypripedium passerinum (James Bay and Mingania), both of them also denizens of the Rockies; Draba minganensis (James Bay, Mingania and Le Bic), an ally of Draba luteola of the Rockies; Gentiana nesophila (James Bay, North Shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Anticosti, Western Newfoundland). (Figs. 62, 63 and 64). The distribution of Gentiana nesophila, and indeed that of the whole group of crossopetalous Gentians in the east, is more suggestive of complex phyto- geographical events, than of a simple story of 'glacial isolation, or of the move- ments of a solid floristic unit held together since pre-glacial times. On the other hand, such extremely local low-level or seashore relics as Cirsium min- ganense, Cypripedium passerinum var. minganense, Erigeron lonchophyllus var. laurentianus, Scirpus pumilis, Gentiana gaspensis, although undoubtedly related to, or identical with, so-called Cordilleran species, do not fit in very well with the nunatak explanation, and call for some amendment or some other hypothesis. Does not for instance the peculiar distribution of Aster gaspensis, found on several successive Baie des Chaleurs rivers, between the twelfth and fifteenth mile from the seashore, suggest a migration along an old Champlain sea beach, rather than a local nunatak origin? (Fig. 39). A last word on a point that might have been raised at the very outset of this study. Is the conception of a senescent preglacial or interglacial flora, vanishing gradually from northeastern America, defensible on biological grounds? Are there really such things as senescent species, and senescent floras in the present world? I have often caught smiles on the lips of my biological auditors, when in- dulging in such anthropomorphic utterances. But I do not think we can escape a more or less guarded admission of this kind, if we look at the facts without bias. The past history of the plant world has much in store about dead species and dead floras. Without searching out of Gaspe, the famous Devonian formations of Escuminac, on Baie des Chaleurs, show a world of extinct fishes buried with a world of extinct Pteridophytes and Seed-ferns, whilst the solid rocks of Cross-Point conceal the unsolved mystery of Proto- taxites (=zNematophycus). Althoutgh we have no means to know how death came to the Pteridosperms, to the Psilophytales, to the giant Lycopods, and to so many strong vegetable types, we can imagine that they did not disappear suddenly, and that at a certain period, notwithstanding their apparent fitness with the environment, they were slowly dying away. The trained field botanist, working in the cliffs of the Gulf of St. Law-</page><page sequence="65">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 553 rence, has somewhat the sensation of witnessing that very process of regression and elimination which the world has seen so often. He cannot but notice th-at many of the extremely local relics, confined to one island cove, to a soli- tary sea-cliff, to one mountain crag, belong to groups extremely well outfitted to spread far and wide, mostly Salicaceae and Compositae. The Mingan Thistle (Cirsium minganense), in spite of its large size, and of its thousands of plumed seeds, is so well protected by its confinement into a few small coves of Mingania, that it had escaped attention until 1924. Dryas Drummondii of the Gaspe gravels, stops short westward, at the Little Cascapedia river. The endemic Taraxacum laurentianum, a sturdy dandelion of the gravel-bars of Mingania, Anticosti, and western Newfound- land, sends out its seeds in the same fashion as the ubiquitous plant we all know, but the endemic plant has nevertheless a very restricted distribution. Such extremely local plants as Cirsium minganense certainly seem to be doomed. If we could prove with reasonable certainty that these forms are disappearing because they are "old" to the point that some essential mechan- ism has ceased to be functional, we could open a new chapter of auto-ecology, and grasp at least one of the negative aspects of evolution. But we are now in possession of a first series of experimental data in con- r.ection with the "health" of the allogenous units of eastern North America. A certain number of the rarest relics and endemics have been grown for the last two years in the Montreal Botanical Garden. Quite unexpectedly they are very successful. Aster gaspensis spreads rapidly through its underground system. Erigeron compositus is self-sown and tends to become weedy on the artificial limestone gravel beds. Cirsium, minganense has germinated and enjoys the Montreal climate. Arnica chionopappa is overgrown and produces tremendously numerous and vigorous rosettes. Solidago multiradiata, which in my personal experience at Cap Gaspe, had not spread outside its narrow cornice for the last fifteen years, here behaves as aggressively as any other Goldenrod. Antennaria gaspensis and Antennaria rupicola override their as- signed places and flow on all sides in dense mats. What of it? Since there does not seem to be anything fundamentally senescent or lethal in the plants themselves, we are naturally led to concede the senescent condition to the allogenous flora as a whole, to consider the relics as beinlg crowded out by a notable change in the environment, climatic or otherwise, bringing about a strong pressure from the more commonplace elements of the tundra and Spruce forest complexes. The other alternative, namely that the allogenous elements are not relics but new-comers, arctic plants, a rear-guard coming back again from the south on the heels of the vanished Wisconsin glacier, leaves without explanation scores of individual cases such as that of the strictly endemic Gentiana gaspensis, Aster gaspensis, Cirsium minganense. To sum up, the situation seems much too complex for one good simple, schematic and dogmatic explanation. There is evidently a general truth in Hooker's hypothesis of a back and forth "mouvement d'ensemble" of the</page><page sequence="66">554 THE AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST whole flora of eastern Canada during and after Pleistocene times. There is also much in favor of the nunatak theory, which may be necessary or helpful to explain a number of cases. How else can the presence of Agoseris gaspensis on Table-top Mountain, of Salix brachycarpa and Polystichum mohrioides on Mt. Albert be explained, notwithstanding the magnesian preference of the latter species? But we cannot round out all the facts without admitting more or less intri- cate and massive Pleistocene or post-Pleistocene migrations. Picturing the dry unforested belt that must have existed along a receding ice-front, as a kind of side-walk extending from the Rockies to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, undoubtedly helps to understand the presence of a good number of sea-level and highly isolated plants, of evident Cordilleran affinity. I see no other way, for in- stance, to justify the present exclusive home of Cirsium minganense. Such is the kind of questions certain brand of botanists whose laboratory is no smaller than the biosphere, worry about. Wise or unwise, they are con- cerned with the life of species, and the life of the floras which they consider as real units, as real collective individuals that are born, live a while and inevitably die. Although this pruning of the Tree of Life outlined above goes on reck- lessly in Time and Space, one should not understand that the Tree itself is gradually losing its vitality. The world has outlived the era of Gymnosperms, and Homo sapiens is adapted to an Angiosperm environment. We do not know what will come next, but reasoning by analogy, we can think that some- thing better, or different, of which we have no premonition, is slowly evol- ving, unnoticed, amongst the multitude of Angiosperm devices. But apart from this phylogenetic advance where the factor Time is supreme, there is a very evident advance in Space going on even within the narrow limits of History. While in a given corner of the Earth, species may become extinct and asso ciations be wiped out, other species may gain strong foothold on new territory. Confining ourselves to the portion of the biosphere we have been considering so far, eastern Canada, we find that, through the agency of man, many Old World plants have found a way to our shores, and in certain cases, have transformed entirely the outlook and ecology of our landscapes. What would be our Spring without the glory of Dandelions (Taraxacum officinale), and our summers without the Daisies (Chrysanthemum Leucanthe- mum), the Vetches (Vicia Cracca), the Mustards (Brassica spp.) and other Mediterranean immigrants that have made good here, sometimes against our wishes. How the Old World Plantago major walked on the heels of white man in America and disputed the ground to the almost identical native plant; how Artemisia vulgaris, brought in the St. Lawrence valley by our great-grandmothers as an emmenagogue, became an almost natural member of our flora; how Galinsoga ciliata, a New World tropical immigrant, became our most typical city weed? All these stories of plant introductions are inter- esting, sometimes fascinating and amazing.</page><page sequence="67">PHYTOGEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEMS OF EAST'N CANADA 555 Long ago, the Purple Loosetrife, Lythrum Salicaria, on its way to girdle the globe, alighted on our fresh-water shores and spread over the shoals and alluvial flats of the St. Lawrence River an immense and almost continuous purple mantle (Fig. 65). But Lythrum Salicaria belongs to a very definite ecological type. It is not an aquatic, nor a semi-aquatic, but it finds a con- genial habitat on low grounds that are submerged in spring-time, but dry up during the summer. This ecological preference left room for a semi-aquatic Fig. 65.

Of such semi-aquatics there are several in the indigenous riparian flora of the St. Lawrence River. But they are kept within definite limits by a long- established adjustment, and by the never-failing balance of parasites. Then appeared, nobody knows how, a short time before 1900 probably, a hardy and beautiful Alismaceous plant, Butomus umbellatus, the Old World Flowering Rush. Spreading very rapidly by means of its seeds, rootstocks and bulblets, Fig. 67.

The two legions have now taken such a hold on the royal waterway of the St. Lawrence, that the Indians of old, keen observers of nature, would feel entirely estranged, would they return to paddle their canoes again along the miles and miles of Lythrum Salicaria and Butomus umbellatus. The Flowering Rush is now entering Lake Champlain, and the Great Lakes by way of Lake Erie. Some day, through canals, it will reach the Mississippi, and the ecology of the Father of Waters will be upset. Notwithstanding the law of Death, there is a tremendous aggressiveness in that wild fire called Life. Because of motors, of radios and the like, because of our knowledge of hormones, vitamins and enzymes, we think we have mas- tered Nature. Of course not! The story is simply this. A strange animal called Homo sapiens endowed with eminent spiritual powers, has thrown peb- bles in the pond, causing concentric wave-rings to ride the mirror of Time eternal. But man has already outwitted himself. When very soon geologi- cally speaking, Homo sapiens will be just another extinct species, the old balance of life will inevitably settle again, barely altered by the past wander- ings of that forgotten mammal called Man. The plants of prey, for millen- niums curbed and overcome by human effort, will emerge to liberty, and resume their attack with restored vigor against our abandoned fields and cities. The age-old offensive alliance of Life and Erosion will obliterate all human traces from the face of the Earth. But it will not be the end of all! On the cooled ashes of what was once the home of Mankind, in the awe of the great cosmic silence, the flaming torch of Life will nevertheless continue to brighten the World!
