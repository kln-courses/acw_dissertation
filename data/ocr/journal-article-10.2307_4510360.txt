It is highly anecdotal, frequently anthropomorphic, but at times interesting, particularly when the details of the procurement of photo- graphs are given. It is, however, as a collection of illustrations of unsurpassed quality and choice of subjects, that this book is recommended without reservation to anyone interested in birds.-D. S. Farner. 64. Wildlife in Color. Roger Tory Peterson. 1951. Houghton Mifflin Com- pany, 2 Park Street, Boston, Mass. vi + 191 pp. $3. This colorful little book, sponsored by the National Wildlife Federation, is designed basically to stimulate a sympathetic appreciation of wildlife and the necessity of effective wildlife con- servation. Wildlife conservation is a national problem and, in a democracy, its basic elements must be understood by a substantial portion of the citizenry. Con- sequently this book is directed to the average layman. Bearing this in mind, the selection and presentation material are both well conceived. To a great extent the text is constructed about the colored reproductions of 453 National Wildlife Federation stamps. The aspect is essentially ecologic, an aspect which has been lacking too frequently in presenting the problems of wildlife conservation to the layman. Western species are not accorded an emphasis equivalent to that given to eastern species. It is disappointing to find that so characteristic a species as the Water Ouzel has been omitted. Unfortunately the reproduction of the illus- trations is by no means uniformly good. Nevertheless this little book is certain to make an importan.t contribution to the development of a greater sympathy for American wildlife. Because of its potential effectiveness -in this respect it is to be hoped that it will have a wide distribution.- D. S. Farner. 65. Birds of Montezuma and Tuzigoot. Henry H. Collins, Jr., with illustra- tions by Roger Tory Peterson. 1951. Southwestern Monuments Association, Mon- tezuma Castle National Monument, Camp Verde, Arizona. 14 pp. $0.25. This attractive little bulletin has been prepared obviously for the visitor who knows nothing about birds. Forty-four species are described in varying detail for pur- poses of field identification. As an aid to identification of these species by the ornithologically inexperienced the bulletin should prove quite useful despite the feeling of the reviewer that the approach could have been at a somewhat higher intellectual level.-D.. S. Farner. NOTES AND NEWS Dr. Donald S. Farner has served as an editor of Bird-Banding for the span of 37 issues, and has carried the heavy load of responsibility for the reviews in virtu- ally all of these issues. It has now become impossible for him to find time for this work, because of his increasing responsibilities in teaching and research at The State College of Washington. With the July issue, therefore, Dr. Farner will limit his work on Bird-Banding to reviews of material in some of the European languages which few other American ornithologists are able to read easily. Seldom has familiarity with ornithological works in other languages been more important than at present, to aid our own research and to avoid duplication of effort; but seldom has it been harder for journals to maintain a comprehensive review section, be- cause of the many other tasks confronting those competent to write such reviews. To Dr. Farner, more than to any other single individual, goes the credit for the breadth of coverage of our review section, achieved by his sacrifice of countless evenings and week-ends. We hope to maintain this breadth of coverage, and we welcome as the new head of the review section Dr. Oliver L. Austin, Jr., widely known for his many years of banding on Cape Cod, Mass., and the author of many books and papers on other aspects of ornithology. Dr. Austin has recently returned from seven years overseas, the last four in charge of wildlife work in Japan under the Occupation. In our January, 1951, issue, we urged readers to make use of Section Aves of the Zoological Record, if they were not already familiar with it. Since then, the Treasurer of the American Ornithologists' Union has agreed to accept orders, even</page></plain_text>
