BioControl Company, Port Sanilac, Michigan 48469 and University of Oklahoma Biological Station, Kingston, Oklahoma 73439 SCHLICHTING, H. E., JR. 1974. Survival of some fresh-water algae under ex- treme environmental conditions. Trans. Amer. Micros. Soc., 93: 610-613. The adapt- ability of some fresh-water algae has allowed their survival under stress of fluctuating temperature, light quality and intensity, pressure, salinity, pH, soil, water, and air chemistry, and moisture. Algae are found in aerial, aquatic, and terrestrial habitats; and their polymorphic tendencies, reflected in their morphological and cytological variations, may have aided in survival through geological time. Numerous studies on nutrient requirements of algae and media composition (Allen, 1952; Bold, 1942; Provasoli, 1958; Rodhe, 1948; Trainor, 1965; and others) have shown that when microgram amounts of some elements are lacking, the algae do not grow well, often become polymorphic (Schlichting &amp; Bruton, 1970; Trainor et al., 1971), or die. Probably all investigators have noted how well some algae will grow in nature and yet how difficult, if not impossible, it is to culture them in the laboratory. Chodot (1913) was severely criticized by his colleagues for his findings concerning algal polymorphism, which showed that due to environmental changes some algae do change their morphology in culture. Today this concept is readily accepted by phycologists. Many species of algae, seemingly unable to adapt, die when faced with various environmental stresses. Survival of other species under adverse condi- tions is often attributed to their ability to form specialized structures (e.g., spores or cysts) or bring about other changes (food reserve accumulation, pig- ment changes, muscilage formation, etc.). This anthropomorphic line of thought is generally logical and offers some "explanations" until it is realized that fre- quently vegetative cells of many green and blue-green algae survive just as readily. This seems illogical and is not easily explanable; yet it does occur. Davis (1972) published an excellent review of algal survival under adverse en- vironmental conditions. Erben (1962) stated, "How surprising it is that we know so little about the formation of resistant stages by freshwater algae." This statement is still essen- tially true today. Studies on thermal algae have been conducted primarily in North America, Japan, Iceland, and New Zealand (Chang, 1966; Copeland, 1936; Kempner, 1963; Kullberg, 1968; Mann, 1964; Mann &amp; Schlichting, 1967; Nash, 1938; Setchell, 1903; Stockner, 1967; Tilden, 1897). More recent studies have been conducted by Brock (1967a-c, 1968, 1969a,b, 1970, 1972), Brock &amp; Brock (1966, 1968, 1970), and Castenholz (1966, 1969, 1970, 1972a,b). The upper temperature limit for growth of thermal blue-green algae has been shown to be around 74 C (Brock, 1967a; Castenholz, 1970). Species of Chorella and Chlorococcum from soil sam- ples survived 130 C for 5 min and were still culturable (Trainor, 1962) while Klebshormidium cells from soil withstood 100 C for 1 hr after being air dried for two years (Parker, Schanen &amp; Renner, 1969). Mann &amp; Schlichting (1967) found two species of viable blue-green algae in thermal pools in Yellowstone Park where the water temperature at the site of collection was 86.6 C. Their TRANS. AMER.

Enzymes from some blue-green algae are not denatured at 85 C, so algae of this kind probably can exist for at least short periods of time at temperatures over 100 C. Diatoms have been found in water temperatures up to 60 C in Taiwan (Chang, 1966), while green algae were always found below 47 C (Mann, 1964). Snow algae have been observed since the time of Aristotle, and the algae in Arctic and Antarctic ice have been studied by several investigators including Cameron (1971, 1972a,b) and Holm-Hansen (1964, 1968). Studies by R. W. Hoham (personal communication) have demonstrated excellent survival rates for snow algae. Viable spores of Chlamydomonas navalis have been maintained in ice and snow-melt water near 0 C for over six years. Daily &amp; McGuire (1954) were the first to show that algal cultures can be preserved in a viable state by lyophilization (sealed culture tubes placed in dry ice and ethyl cellulose at -55 C for 2 min). Cultures in 10% glycerol and 5% lactose, maltose or raffinose allowed for an increased per cent viability when frozen and stored in the liquid or gas-phase of liquid nitrogen. Species of Scenedesmus and Anacystis were frozen with up to 66% survival (Daily &amp; Hig- gens, 1974). Ohlmacher &amp; Schlichting (1967) froze cultures of algae at -76 C with acetone and dry ice in both the laboratory and the field, using a frozen core sampler. While all the blue-green algae survived, only a few green algae in the hydrosol and substratum survived the 5 min freeze. Some algae are very sensitive to changes in salinity, but certain species of Chlorella, Chromulina, Oscillatoria, and Stichococcus were grown in both fresh- water and sea-water media. Fresh-water algae dominated seafoam from the oceanic beaches of Florida, North Carolina, Washington, and Ireland where salinities ranged from 37.3 to 85.5 ppt and pH from 6.6 to 7.8 (Schlichting, 1971). Maynard (1968) found many marine diatoms in seafoam from the open sea off the Florida coast. It has long been known that light quality and intensity produce changes in algal growth and survival. Both green and blue-green algae have been cultured in the absence of light for several months if the necessary inorganic and organic constituents, especially sugars, are present (Wiedeman &amp; Bold, 1965). Changes in pH as related to algal growth and survival have been observed by many investigators (Prescott, 1962). Blue-green algae grow abundantly above a pH of 8 and yet, according to Brock (1973) and Brock &amp; Darland (1970), none grew at a pH below 4. Some green algae such as Chlanmydomonas acido- philis grow well at a pH of 2 (J. J. A. McLaughlin, personal communication) while a number of desmids grow in acid mine wastes with a pH of 1.5-2 and in peat bogs with a pH of 4-5. Little is known about the effect of increased pressure on algal viability, growth, and morphology. Studies on Euglena gracilis showed that an increase in pressure of 500-1,000 atm. induced morphological change (Gross, 1965). How fresh-water algae adapt to extreme environmental conditions is poorly understood; how they can survive as dormant vegetative or specialized cells under these extreme conditions for undetermined periods of time is simply not known. Because there is a constant migration or dispersal through soil, water, and air, free-living microorganisms are not isolated from each other except for very brief periods. Habitats "select" microorganisms. However, aerial fallout and trans- port via amphibians, birds, fish, insects, mammals, and reptiles over vast periods of time allow for continuous invasion into "isolated" habitats where the micro- organisms can adapt, grow, and modify the chemical nature of these ecosystems.</page><page sequence="3">612 TRANS.
