<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON By ABRAHAM CRONBACH, Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati ' ן יHAT the idea of divine help has been the very nerve and fiber of Judaism is a truth so palpable as to be a truism. For this reason, the considerations advanced in the present essay should justify its inclusion in a volume devoted to Jewish studies even though the treatment adopted may be psychological psychological and sociological rather than philological. Quotations from Hebrew literature will be few and allusions to Jewish history will be scant. Yet where has the thought of divine help received more striking expression than in Hebrew literature and where have the experiences illustrative of divine help received more thrilling exemplification than in Jewish history? Moreover, in an age and among a people with whom scientific advance and institutional changes have led to a discard of many ancestral convictions, it can hardly be a matter of indifference how far and in what sense, that divine help so copiously affirmed by the fathers can still be pre dicated intelligently and conscientiously. Nor need the citation of non-Jewish writers call for any apology in a publication which would not hesitate to cite Wellhausen,Wellhausen, Cheyne, Haupt, Stade, Nowack, Duhm or Marti in the Biblical field, Wuensche, Herford, Fiebig, Holzman, the elder Delitzsch, Baer or Billerbeck in the Talmudic field and Schiirer, Hausrath, Ewald, Niese and Moore in the his torical field. The present study, as already indicated, belongs to the domain of psychology as readily as to that of sociology. The sociological analysis of our second part needs as its basis the psychological analysis of the first part. "We shall take the affirmation of divine help as it is familiarly voiced and shall</page><page sequence="2">584 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [2] first inquire: " Precisely what do the affirmants mean? " We shall discover that here, as so often elsewhere, the apparently simple is bewilderingly complex. The help of God means a diversity of things not only among different people and on different occasions but also within one and the same mind upon one and the same occasion. As the meanings of divine help vary, the sociological implications of those meanings vary; not the least important of these variations being the status of these several meanings as topics of controversy. Theological dispute, we shall find, concerns not all of the meanings but only some of them. Seemingly a proposition upon which theist and atheist hopelessly divide, " God helps " is is in reality an intricate bundle of propositions some of which are challenged by the atheist and some of which are no more subject to difference of opinion than the proposition "Water freezing becomes ice " or " The sun is more luminous than the moon." PART ONE Psychological Bearings I. THE NOUN « HELP " Among the things referred to by affirmations of divine help are certain events or occurrences which are taken to be manifestations of such help—recovery from sickness, rain terminating a spell of drought, escape from danger, victory in war, enhancement of finances, acquisition of friends, the worsting of enemies, reconciliation with opponents, the abatement of mental turmoil, progress in ethical endeavor or whatever other happenings, physical or psychical, have prompted people to say, "God helped." It must be noticed that the need involved is always one ranking exaltedly in a hierarchy of needs. The needs that figure in affirmations of divine help are never the trivial but always the important ones. No one ever says: "God helped me smoke that cigar," " God helped me tip my hat," " God helped me pass the dessert," "God helped me powder my nose." Yet, how promptly those absurd words would cease</page><page sequence="3">[3] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 585 to be absurd in the mouth of one long afflicted with paralysis and suddenly cured! The occasion has then ceased to be trivial and has become momentous. We smile at the athlete who claims that God did help him or will help him to victory. Prof. Pratt, in one of his books on the psychology of religion, amuses the reader with the story of a woman who, on the morning of a day on which she was to give a reception, found herself with a disfiguring cold in the head but who, thanks to God's help, was well enough in the afternoon to make a good facial impression by the time the guests had assembled. The old Sunday School teacher who forgot to bring the large package of application blanks and had on hand only the 101 blanks contained in the smaller package and then ascribed it to providential dispensation that exactly 101 persons applied in the matter requiring the blanks, may seem queer to the sophisticated listener. Yet that listener himself needs only a situation which is to him as important as that registration was to the old Sunday School teacher and he will himself perhaps predicate divine help. It is said that in extremis even atheists sometimes "call upon the Lord." This circumstance of need characterized by extraordinary urgency should account for the pronounced rôle played by the factor of unexpectedness in most affirmations of divine help. Not the expected recovery but the unexpected, not the expected financial assistance but the unexpected, not the expected vindication but the unexpected is likely to be attributed to divine help. " The Lord of heaven and earth, out of darkness, out of silence, by ways that thou understandest not, shall redeem thy soul " says the poet, Edward Carpenter, " to one in trouble." This may probably be accounted for by obser ving that the very lack of knowledge which occasions the need will also occasion the unexpectedness of the help. Nor is help something purely negative. Most salutary experiences are an advance as well as a deliverance, an attainment of higher good as well as the restoration of a prior good. Out of misfortune comes wisdom. Financial reverses may spur to financial reorganisation not merely recovering</page><page sequence="4">586 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [4] the loss but securing a stability not previously enjoyed. Sick ness may prompt measures which not only cure but actually induce a level of health higher than that which preceded the sickness. A political upheaval may not only pass away but also pass into arrangements marking an improvement upon the earlier period of tranquility. Sociologists remind us of the stimulating rôle in social progress played by social crisis. One emerges from adversity not merely into one's former well-being but into a more estimable well-being. "They that came up through great tribulation stood nearest the throne of God." With characteristic unexpectedness, the very troubles calling for help can be part of the process of producing the help. II. THE ADJECTIVE " DIVINE " Among the affirmations of divine help, there may be discriminated at least three different senses in which the adjective "divine" is applied: (1) "Divine" refers to the alleged cause of the salutary events and means "supernatural." (2)(2) "Divine" refers to the ideal which is advanced toward realization in the salutary turn of events and means " valuable, important, significant." (3) " Divine " refers to the psychological expedients employed to bring about the favorable turn of events—hope, prayer, aspiration, &amp;c.—and means " religious." 1 It is generally assumed that, except among the intellectual élite,élite, the first use of the adjective prevails exclusively. But is this assumption correct? What if scrutiny were to show that, on the whole, idealistic elements exceed the supernatural in the commonly prevalent God conceptions? There are many in dications that, even with the "common" people, the word " God " means a supreme ideal or means that more extensively than it means a first cause or any kind of cause. The following 1 That the divergent meanings of religion are legion will be overlooked at no point in this paper. Religion is not a thing but a history. The word will be used for any point in that changing continuum which reaches back to magic and totemism and forward to Emerson and Felix Adler.</page><page sequence="5">[j][5] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 587 are some of the facts that can be adduced to substantiate this view: I.I. First we must draw the distinction between the God of worship and the God of customary theology—a distinction which should impress even the casual observer. A loving Father is one thing; a First Cause is something much different. The theological God who contrives miracles is hardly the same as the saint's " Light Within." Contrast also the moods involved —in the one case, a God in Whom we trust; in the other, a God about Whom we debate: in the one case, a God " Whom alone we will serve in reverence"; in the other, a God of argument and disputation. Is it not precarious to apply to the one meaning of " God " reflections pertinent to the other? Or contrast the hymn books of any church with its theological books and both with its prayer books which occupy a kind of way station between hymns and theology. In the hymn books, God is " Love Divine," " Sun of my soul," " Rock of Ages," " A Fortress strong," " A Banner high," " My Light and my Salvation," " The King of Love," &amp;c. How different from a " First Cause," a " Great Hypothesis," an " Under lying Substance " or whatever else the theological phraseology may be?2 Even the " Creator " of the hymn books can hardly be the same as the " Creator " of the theological books. In a context in which " Rock," " Banner," " Light," " Fortress," are obviously figurative, " Creator " can hardly be otherwise than figurative. The metaphorical character of hymnology alone forms a significant contrast to theology with its literalisms. The usual non-theological sense of the word "God" is, in brief, what the philosophers call evaluative as contrasted with descriptive. It is a usage which serves not to communicate 2 " The Scholastic philosophers describe the deity as ' Ens a se extra et supra omne genus, necessarium, unum infinite, perfectum, simplex, immutabile, immensum, eternum, intelligens.' *—Will Durant, The Story of Philosophy, New York, 1926, p. 558. Durant adds waggishly, "This is magnificent; what deity would not be proud of such a definition? " The Scholastics, like many who preceded and many who followed them were unconscious of the fact that their language was evaluative and consequently fraught with bearings different from those of language that is descriptive.</page><page sequence="6">588 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [6] something but to indicate something in the user's state of mind. As such, the word refers not to a thing but to the excellence of things, the blessedness of things, the ideal embodied or approached in things rather than the source or cause of things.3 2. Historically, the gods have always been invented and invoked for what they could supposedly do. In situations involving the gods, various types of important, tangible bene fits such as crops, health, herds, victories have been the vital concern. People never invent faineant gods.4 The gods them selves are less important than these ulterior values with which they are associated. The gods, regarded as causal factors, amount to certain hypotheses touching the ceremonial means of securing these values. We can even admit a certain effectiveness in these cere monial expedients: not, to be sure, the physical effectiveness ascribed to them but a psychological effectiveness which, though unintended and unnamed, may have been sufficiently pro nounced to buttress the belief in physical effectiveness. There are modern parallels to this phenomenon. Thus a familiar hymn has the words: 3 The distinction receives extensive treatment in Royce, The World and the the Individual, and more recently in Ogden and Richards, The Meaning of Meaning (London, 1925). On the one hand there is, according to Ogden and Richards, " the use of words to express or excite feelings or attitudes " and, on the other, the use of words for purposes of statement, that is, " the recording, the support, the organisation and the communication of references" (p. 257). The terms " symbolic " and " emotive " employed by Ogden and Richards are, though marking essentially the same contrast, not so well suited to the present discussion as the older expressions " descriptive " and " evaluative." Emotiveness is, after all, not something peculiar to words but is also characteristic of non-verbal situations. " Symbolic " is especially inept because of its customary use for the very opposite of what Ogden and Richards mean by " symbolic." Issue is taken, however, only with the nomenclature of Ogden and Richards. Their discussion elucidates the distinction involved most adequately. 4 The gods of Epicureanism, non-participant in human affairs, represent not an invention but a criticism. Epicureanism is a philosophy challenging the popular religion whose gods were originally and persistently concerned with the affairs of men.</page><page sequence="7">[7] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 589 " I love to tell the story Because I know it's true; It satisfies my longings As nothing else will do." That the longings are satisfied by the story, there is no occasion to deny. The error lies, of course, in the use for non-emotional, i. e. for historical purposes of a story whose effectiveness is purely of the psychological type. Similarly, in primitive times, the psychological effectiveness of various rituals and beliefs may long have blinded their devotees to their ineffectiveness on the physical plane. Anthropologists tell us that men once worshipped their ancestors, sometimes in the guise of totem animals. Some worshipped stones; some the luminaries. Crude as these beliefs may have been, they are not devoid of a certain selective aspect. Ancestors, stones and luminaries could never have been chosen as objects of worship had they been entirely without an emotional appeal, an appeal which, in its turn, must have emanated from certain actual benefits or injuries associated with ancestors, stones and luminaries. Thus, even in primitive times, the essence of divinity must have been less a matter of causation than a matter of value, importance, significance, in a word, a matter of relation to some momentous good. The same point of emphasis is betrayed in the familiar modern arguments about the moral and civic interests at stake in the maintenance of religion. These arguments, whether valid or not, also stress effects rather than causes—effects regarded as fraught with a high degree of value, importance, urgency.5 5 " The idea that man needs salvation depends, in fact, upon two simples ideas whereof the main idea is constituted. The first is the idea that there is some end or aim of human life which is more important than all other aims, so that by comparison with this aim, all else is secondary and subsidiary; and perhaps relatively unimportant, or even vain and empty. The other idea is this: that man as he now is, or as he naturally is, is in great danger of so missing this highest aim as to render his whole life a senseless failure by virtue of this coming short of his true goal."—Josiah Royce, Sources of Religions Insight,</page><page sequence="8">59° ABRAHAM CRONBACH [8] Would we then be entirely wrong in asserting that the phraseology about a supernatural cause is largely a matter of of faulty expression? Are not instances extremely common in which a person, meaning one thing, says something else owing to an imperfect comprehension of his own mental bearings? We may, in this connection, well take admonition from a notable recent work on the subject of meaning from which the following passages may be culled: " In all discussion we shall find that what is said is only in part determined by the things to which the speaker is referring. Often without a clear consciousness of the fact people have preoccupations which determine their use of words. Unless we are aware of their purposes and interests at the moment we shall not know what they are talking about." 6 "We only know for certain what is said when we know why it is said." 7 "The meaning of A is that to which the mental process interpreting A is adapted. This is the most important sense in which words have meaning." 8 3• Closely relevant here is what has already been noted about a hierarchy of needs which corresponds to a hierarchy of values. How extensively religion discriminates between the sacred and the profane, the more important and the less important, the higher and the lower! Religion does not, like every day life, content itself with saying that one thing is better than another. It goes beyond this and says that one set New York, 1912. "It is no new thing to say that what men call religion is, at its focal points, a reaction, solemn or joyous, in which the individual or the group concentrates attention upon something so important that it is, for the consciousness of the moment, life itself." George Albert Coe, The Psychology of Religion,Religion, Chicago, 1916, p. 69. Also pages 70 and 89 on religion as importance. 6 Ogden and Richards, op. cit., p. 229. 7 Ibid., p. 193 foot note. 8 Ibid., p. 325.</page><page sequence="9">[9] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 591 of interests or one set of tastes is better than another.9 Such comparisons plainly invoke or come nearer than every day life to invoking an ideal which is ulterior to all other ideals —a supreme ideal, as we must say for want of any better terminology.10 4• The tendency of religion to become spiritualized or, as President Hall says, " inwardized " fully accords with this interpretation. In religious contexts, the word " spiritual " is, like the word "God," an evaluative term. Spiritual good, the good of the soul, &amp;c. with which God gets to be identified is only another way of saying the highest good, the super lative satisfaction, the ampler embodiment of the supreme ideal. We shall be misled if we take the word "spiritual" in the sense of " mental " or " emotional." Give the word that sense and all satisfaction becomes spiritual. The satis factions that issue from the most degrading indulgences would then be spiritual: all satisfactions involve " mind " and emotions. " Spiritual " in the religious sense is not the opposite of of material but the opposite of inferior, less satisfying, less acceptable, less approximate to the supreme ideal.11 9 Prof. Coe reminds us that " human desires come thus to include the desire to have desires," op. cit., p. 67, and that " purposes, as contrasted with impulses, and the increasing organisation of life through ideas are achievements. They require redirection of old desires," p. 221. 10 The inadequacy lies in the fact that the language of our discussion is descriptive while that to which reference is made is something emotive—some thing of a nature that requires evaluative language and that finds its consummate expression not in language at all but in art and in conduct. 11 The use of a generic term for eulogistic purposes is a common linguistic phenomenon. " Social " which means descriptively any relation between human beings, gets to mean evaluatively the desirable or satisfactory relations. " Christian " which means primarily the adherent of a certain creed is, often to the irritation of non-Christians, used to designate the exergplary type among those adherents. " Nature might stand up And say to all the world This ■was a man!" (Julius Caesar V, 5) The word " man " in this context obviously does not signify merely an adult human male but an excellent specimen of that genus. Similarly the word " spiritual " which, in some connections, means the emotions and volitions or even the cognitions comes, in religious contexts, to mean the highest type of such manifestations.</page><page sequence="10">592 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [10] The notable literary outbursts of spirituality will sustain these conclusions: With Thee is the fountain of life, In Thy light shall we see light. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, So panteth my soul after Thee, O God. My good is not beyond Thee. Whom have I in heaven but Thee? And beside Thee I desire none upon earth. My soul longeth for God, for the living God. The Lord is my light and my salvation. My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. O that I knew where I might find Him! Seek ye the Lord while He may be found. Thy love it is my heart desires... Thou art all my soul's delight. Thou hast made us for Thee, O Lord, and restless is our heart until it find its rest in Thee. One would have to be blinded by the prepossession that " God " never means anything except a supernatural cause in order to miss seeing in passages such as these the predominance of the idealistic over the causal-supernaturalistic implications of deity. God ceases here to be the alleged means toward an end and becomes Himself the end. God is no longer the supernatural origin but the idealistic goal. Similar utterances are countless in the literature of religion, particularly, as already noted, in the hymns and prayers. Here again we see the error of the assumption that people are always successful in formulating the contents of their own minds and that when they assert that their God is a cause, they necessarily mean what they say or mean it exclusively. We might profit by imitating the physicians who regard it almost as matter of course that a patient's ailment is not located where the patient thinks it is.</page><page sequence="11">[11] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 593 5• Yet another specimen of religious phraseology will go to strengthen our conclusion. This is the use of the adjective " personal " as connected with the deity. A purely causal deity might as well be impersonal. Nothing is so typical of the mechanical i. e. the impersonal as the cause-effect relation. However, the word " personal " has a number of meanings. One meaning is " corporeal "—having a body like a man or like a totem animal. This, unquestionably, is the sense in which the deity has at times been understood to be personal. Yet "personal" does not always mean "corporeal." Of this, we are reminded by an eminent sociologist. Says Prof. CooleyCooley . « Facial expression, tone of voice, and the like, the sensible nucleus of personal and social ideas, serve as the handle, so to speak, of such ideas, the principal substance of which is drawn from the region of inner imagination and sentiment. The personality of a friend as it lives in my mind and forms there a part of the society in which I live, is simply a group or system of thoughts associated with the symbols that stand for him... And his presence does not consist in the près sure of his flesh upon a neighboring chair, but in the thought clustering about some symbol of him, whether the latter be his tangible presence or something else." 12 The historical tendency of religion has been, while retaining divine personality, to repudiate divine corporeality. " Personal " has come to mean " manlike " in an ethical and not in a physical sense. God, while not having hands, feet and eyes, does presumably have love, justice and mercy,—be it observed, evaluative terms, all of them. 12 Charles H. Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1902), p. 81. At a later point in this same volume (p. 281) occurs this reflection: "The ideal persons of religion are not fundamentally different psychologically or sociologically, from other persons... The fact that they have attached to them no visible or tangible material body, similar to that of other persons, is indeed an important fact, but rather from the psychological point of view; mentally and socially regarded it is of one sort with other personal ideas, no less a verifiable fact, and no more or less inscrutable." Hebrew Union College Annual V. 38</page><page sequence="12">594 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [12] Still does not even such a conception preclude identi fication of deity with supreme value? Is not such a deity likewise a causal instrument rather than the ideal finality? The reply is: Not necessarily and not altogether. People can mean supreme value even though they say: "just, loving, merciful God." It is extremely common for two closely related things to appear as merged into one—like the sight of both eyes, the colors of a composite, the taste of a mixture, the vibrations forming one sound.13 Analogously, the supreme ideal becomes fused with the paramount way of realizing that ideal. The ideal may not literally possess the qualities love, justice and mercy. But the path toward the ideal lies through the human relations exemplifying love, justice and mercy.14 Phrasing it otherwise: God is related to certain human qualities—related, however, not as object to attribute but as end to means. Popular theologizing can not but confuse the two relations. And yet, while language may allude to the inapplicable relation, devoutness utilises the real one; just as people may digest their food perfectly though their theories regarding digestion may be entirely unscientific. Language is, after all, not man's only way of responding to his environment.15 " The flower is red," we say. We mean that the light emanating from the flower is red. " I hear the bell," we say. What we do hear is the air vibrations proceeding from the bell. " I see the sun." We do not see the sun but the aura surrounding the sun. " The sun is setting." No, it is the earth that is rotating. " The picture is on the screen." The picture is really in the stereopticon. Countless instances can illustrate how our meaning may be correct even though our wording be incorrect. That is why the meanings of words must be sought not in the words themselves but 13 To the same class of phenomena belong the various " complexes " and constellations of associations : loving the flag because loving the country symbolized by the flag, hating a dogma because hating the person who espouses the dogma, fearing a horse because fearing the parent associated with the horse, &amp;c. 14 This point will concern us extensively in the second part of this paper. 15 Perhaps the latest word on this subject is by John B. Watson in Behaviorism (New York, 19a;), especially pages 130, 131, 213.</page><page sequence="13">[13] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 595 in the total reaction accompanying the words. Again let us recall Ogden and Richards: " A symbol refers... not necessarily to what it... is intended by the user to refer to." " In all discussion we shall find that what is said is only in part deter mined by the things to which the speaker is referring. Often without a clear consciousness of the fact people have preoccupations which determine their use of words. Unless we are aware of their purposes and interests at the moment, we shall not know what they are talking about." "We only know for certain what is said when we know why it is said." " The meaning of A is that to which the mental process interpreting A A is adapted. This is the most important sense in which words have meaning." 16 An endeavor to make language conform more exactly to the reality can be discerned in the tendency of theological affirmations to substitute abstract nouns for adjectives. " God is love," " God is truth," " God is justice," are modes of ex pression which come somewhat nearer to saying that God is the the value realized when human interactions exemplify love, truth or justice. So closely intertwined are the human inter actions on the one hand and the superlative value on the other that they inevitably appear to coalesce. Nor have we yet exhausted the meanings of the word " personal." We have considered its descriptive applications. But, like " God," " spiritual " and much other religious usage, the word has also its evaluative sense. Personal can mean " significant," " impressive," " important." Human beings do not become persons (in this sense) until they become significant. A human being may have a body and still lack personality. Human beings are persons in so far ,as they are the embodiment of some ideal. The supreme person is the surpreme ideal and human beings are persons in so far as they partake of the supreme ideal. God, we might say, is not a person (in the Op. cit., pages 201, 229, 193 foot note, 325 respectively. *R*</page><page sequence="14">596 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [14] sense of exalted value) because He resembles men but men are persons because they resemble God. Personality is somehow related to the Kantian ends in themselves. Kant, it will be recalled, would have us treat our fellow men not as mere means but as ends. The supreme ideal is necessarily such an end in itself. A cause is a means toward an end. In short, the prepossession among theists for the personality of God adds to the indications that supreme ideal rather than supreme cause is the real even if imperfectly articulated meaning. 6. The very controversies on this point between science and theology prove that a cause can not be all that people mean when a divine cause is what they profess to mean. If the sole purpose of affirming God were to account causally for phenomena, why the protracted quarreling with science when science comes with its manifestly superior account of causa tion? If causes are the object of search, why not an in variable welcome for the improved methods of the scientific men? The fact is that we have here again what the psycho analysts call a " displacement." People say " cause " when they mean or partly mean that value which chances to be associated with and consequently confused with cause. The confusion results from a tendency described by Prof. Dewey: " From the standpoint of control and utilization, the tendency to assign superior reality to causes is explicable. A ,cause' is not merely an antecedent; it is that antecedent which if manipulated regulates the occurrence of the consequent. That is why the sun rather than night is the causal condition of the day. Knowing that consequences will take care of themselves if conditions can be had and managed, an ineradic able natural pragmatism indulges in a (heap and short conversion, and conceives the cause as intrinsically more primary and necessary. This practical tendency is increased by the fact that time is a softener and dignifier; present troubles lose their acuteness when they</page><page sequence="15">[15][151 DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 597 are no longer present. Old times are proverbially the good old times, and history begins with a Garden of Paradise or a Golden Age. Good, being congenial, is held to be normal; and what is suffered is a deviation, creating the problem of evil. Thus the earlier gets moral dignity as well as practical superiority." Elsewhere, Dewey speaks of " the common philosophic fallacy of converting an eventual function into an antecedent force or cause." 17 7• The identical characteristic of the God idea is manifest also in the various other attempts to defend theism such as that of harmonizing the old beliefs with modern science or, as in the instance of this paper, that of unreservedly ac cepting the positions and the consequences of science, definitely abandoning supernaturalism, and identifying theism with that idealism to which science and art as well as religion jointly subscribe. Why do we trouble to talk about God at all? And why are people so easily satisfied with fragile and inconclusive arguments in this connection? Why their toleration of glaring inconsistencies? Why their naïve addiction to flimsy ratio nalizations? How, in short, account for the persistent desire to conserve theism, if theism is nothing but a superannuated theory of causation? The truth is that not the supernatural causation which science has invalidated but an idealism the renunciation of which would be a bewildering self contra diction is the real point involved. As the invisible part of an iceberg greatly exceeds the visible part, so are the in articulate idealistic meanings of " God," more than the ar ticulate causal ones. 8. Our contention gains further strength when we look into the validity of the claim that people " believe " in God. "Believe" can mean: 17 John Dewey, Experience and Nature, p. 109. Ibid., p. 308. Also Felix Adler, An An Ethical Philosophy of Life, which speaks of " the superstition of causality." " The prejudice of causality is probably ineradicable, just as the illusion that the sun revolves around the earth persists" (p. 141).</page><page sequence="16">598 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [16] a) Affirming the existence of something. b) Affirming one's approval of or loyalty to something. An example of the first sense is: " Some astronomers believe in the canals on Mars." An example of the second is: "I believe in the policies of Mr. Coolidge." In the Old Testament and perhaps largely in the New, " believe " carries the second sense, while current theology both professional and amateur takes the word in its first sense. Now, it is precisely to the most devout that God is conspicuously other than an object of belief in the first sense. Belief, in this sense, implies less than absolute certainty. As James showed in his famous essay, it involves the taking of chances. It embraces the possibility of disbelief on the part of others and eventually on the part of the believer himself. It is the acceptance of a conclusion on less than clinching evidence. It is the adoption of a hypothesis which, like any hypothesis, is subject to supercession by a better one. But when people commit themselves to "The Rode of Ages," "The Everlasting Arms," "The Eternal Refuge" can they mean anything so uncertain? Certainty is the very essence of their attitude. For religious fervor, the alternative to certainty is atheism; tertium non datur. Something abso lutely certain must be found to which to attach the word " God " or the word must remain unattached. People no longer worship ancestors, stones and planets because these objects do not satisfy the needs that a God is expected to satisfy. Anything uncertain, hypothetical, debatable, similarly can not satisfy the needs of those who need a " Rock That is high." People may rightly use the word " believe " in their less religious moments when nothing of consequence is at stake. But, in times of tremendous earnestness, the word can only carry the Biblical significance of loyalty, steadfastness, approval. How inept, at such times, is " believing " with the import of "favoring a certain hypothesis"! And there is an absolute certainty. The very need of distinguishing between certain and uncertain, true and false, satisfactory and objectionable can be denied only at the cost of denying that one is denying. That need is the irrefragible</page><page sequence="17">[17] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 599 certainty.™certainty.™ That need presupposes a criterion (though not necessarily a clearly articulated criterion), a supreme ideal, a summum bonum, an ultimate reference hovering over all trends, judgments and discriminations. Men may have in fused many meanings into the word " God." The supreme ideal is surely one of those meanings—a meaning which can exist even if dimly and confusedly, in minds hospitable to other and incompatible meanings. That supreme ideal, the goal of all longing and striving, approximation to which con stitutes goodness, truth and beauty, recession from which constitutes evil, falsehood and ugliness; that ideal which is itself not a cause but in our advance toward which we are obliged to study and utilise causation; which is not a matter of belief but toward which all believing and disbelieving are alike a groping; which is neither subjective nor objective but the occasion for the entire discrimination between subjective and objective; which is the incentive and direction of science no less than of religion—that supreme ideal is one of the meanings in fact one of the most vital meanings of the "" common man's " God. Finally we should notice that, as soon as the word " God " becomes divested of its idealistic implications, the result is atheism. An atheist is merely a person for whom the word "God" has lost or has never acquired any idealistic implications. The modern atheist usually associates the word with anti scientific world views or with distasteful ecclesiastical or economic policies. The purely supernatural (and consequently non-existent) God is thus an atheistic rather than a theistic concept. The God of the theist is supernatural only in cidentally and by misinterpretation. Essentially the God of the theist is not a supernatural cause but a supreme ideal. The question often arises regarding the permissibility of using the word " God " to mean " supreme ideal," considering 18 " Values are values, things having certain intrinsic qualities. Of them as values there is accordingly nothing to be said ; they are what they are."—Dewey, op. cit., p. 396.</page><page sequence="18">600600 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [18] the fact that people do use the word in the causal super naturalistic sense. In rejoinder it must be borne in mind that the problem of what constitutes the " right " to use a given word in a given way is by no means simple. Words have arisen and their meanings have multiplied because people have thus desired. Why then should not the mere desire to use a given word for a given object constitute the " right " to such usage? Why should desire which is right in the one case be wrong in the other? Desires, be it remembered, are not spontaneously generated. There must be something in the old meaning of a word which begets the desire to extend the word's application. Ogden and Richards surmise that it may depend upon emotive qualities.19 The "right" of an object to be called by a certain name may well be grounded upon the sheer ability of the object to get itself called by that name. It may be argued that, inasmuch as the word " God " has so frequently meant a supernatural cause, misunderstand ing may arise if a different sense is intended. But the danger of being misunderstood is one against which it is necessary to be on guard no matter what the word used or what the subject discussed. Precautions against misunderstanding are imperative always. In gatherings such as those for prayer and inspiration where the word " God " rarely possesses other than its evaluative sense, what peril can there be in employing its evaluative sense? On the other hand, in theological discussions, where the causative sense is likely to prevail, the evaluative use of the term may need express asseveration. To abandon the term entirely is to be deprived of the finest evaluative expedient that language possesses. The word serves to identify the aspirations of all the myriads living and dead who have used it. And the identification of aspiration, as we shall notice later, is an extraordinary social device for strengthening aspiration. The word should, of course, be abandoned when addressing people for whom it has lost its favorable connotation. In the presence of the atheist, the word had best be omitted except under circumstances per 19 Op. cit., p. 23 6.</page><page sequence="19">[19] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 601 mitting the elucidation of its evaluative import and favoring the conciliation of atheistic or agnostic idealism with that of the theist. When, therefore, people affirm divine help, the adjective " divine " does not necessarily or exclusively designate the source of the help. It indicates rather the significance, the importance, the value of the help; in short, the relation both of the need for the help and of the help itself to a supreme ideal.20 III. PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPEDIENTS The additional sense in which help can be divine is something entirely psychological. As stated above: "Divine" refers to the psychological expedients employed to bring about the favorable turn of events—hope, prayer, aspiration, &amp;c.21 Art, science and every day life are, no less than religion, an outreaching for a goal, an attempt to win satisfactions by winning higher satisfactions. The unique thing about religion is its aptitude for being explicit about the ultimate goal. Art, science and every day life presuppose the supreme ideal but content themselves with presupposing. Religion goes beyond this inarticulate presupposing. Religion is, in some unique way, concerned with the goal itself. The benefit of religion is the benefit inherent in the fact that the conscious ness of the ultimate aim will enhance the pursuit of that aim. We go better when we know whither we are going. We seek better when we know what we are seeking. In biological evolution, intelligence has supervened upon auto matism because intelligence which implies activity with an end in view surmounts difficulties to which automatism succumbs. Similarly, to realize that it is a supreme ideal that 20 Prof. Adler and his associates of the Ethical Culture Movement have a predilection for the adjective " divine " though shying at the affirmative use of the noun " God." This may be due to the fact that the more reserved use of the bisyllabic Latin adjective makes it less suggestive of the causal supernatural than the more commonly employed Anglo-Saxon monosyllabic noun. 21 Supra, page 586.</page><page sequence="20">602 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [20] we are striving after will predispose us to side-step many an obstacle. But this conscious or almost conscious reference to an ultimate goal, while the distinctive feature of religion, is not its only feature. Religion has many additional expedients, among them a rich repertoire of imagery. Religion familiarly lays under contribution the resources of the various arts— music, drama (including ritual), pictorial and plastic repre sentations, architecture, as well as poetry, fiction and mytho logy. Religion also has its wealth of impressive phraseology, " Heavenly Father," " Rode of Ages," " King of Kings," "" Everlasting Light " and the like, the power of which lies in the capacity of imagery to influence the emotions and the will. By imagery is meant those elements of experience which are detached from the rigid time-space order which we call the outer or objective world. It is made up largely of memories, among them the so-called unconscious memories of Psychoanalysis, these memories possessing an unlimited fluidity, being amenable to any number and kind of dis placements going on " inside the head." 22 Now images are instruments precisely like knives, drugs, locomotives and electric currents. Like any instrument they are good or bad according to the purpose for which they are used and according to their suitability for that purpose. Many images are serviceable for handling the so-called outer world, those experiences belonging to the objective time-space order. The various formulae of the sciences belong to this class of images—the earth that is round, the electric current which requires a closed circuit, the stress to be borne by a 22 By this admittedly crude definition of imagery, no prejudice is intended against Behaviorism or any other school of Psychology which may employ different interpretative language. We may as readily say " verbal conditioning * or " retinal stimulation " (Watson, op. cit., p. 213). The phenomenon itself is under consideration: the interpretative positions respectively adopted by the several schools of Psychology will not effect our conclusions. Indeed a better word than " imagery " appears to be needed. The salient thing is not the image but certain forms of mentation to which the image is but accessory. The point is treated in Ogden and Richards, op. cit., pp. 30, 148-1 ji, 157, 328.</page><page sequence="21">[21][21] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 603 bridge not yet built, the organs of some paleolithic monster —all of these are uses of imagery by which external events are to be controlled. Then there is a class of imagery which is impotent for the control of external events but highly effective for the control of the emotions and volitions—for visceral rather than manual responses, if the Behaviorist so prefers.23 Art derives its material from imagery of this type. Falsehood results when imagery which is suitable for affective-volitional control is used as though it were also suitable for external control. Myth used as though it were history and fancy used as though it were fact give results much akin to those that might be expected if a lily were used as though it were a furnace or a jewel as though it were a shovel. Bosanquet has put it: " Everything is Real so long as we do not take it for what it is not." A myth is never false so long as it is taken as a myth and not mistaken for history. Drama is not false so long as it is understood to be drama but becomes hopelessly deceptive for the child visiting the theater for the first time and confusing dramatic incident with life off stage. The imagery of religion can not possibly be false as long as it fulfills its function of affective-volitional control.24 The moment the same imagery gets to be used for other purposes, the result is all of the theological missteps over which atheism gloats and on which scepticism thrives. Much religious imagery has the distinction of having consistently escaped misuse. " Rock of Ages " has not, since the days of stone worship, given rise to the supposition that the deity is a lapidary specimen nor has " The Lord is my shepherd " misled any one into insisting that the deity is a cattle breeder. Less fortunate has been the phrase " Heavenly Father." In Christianity, at least, it has created the burden some need of defending the doctrine of the Virgin Birth. The afftctive-volitional benefits of the word " Creator " have been obtained perhaps at the greatest cost of all. The use of 23 Watson, op. cit., p. 130. 24 " So far as words are used emotively, no question as to their truth in the strict sense can directly arise." Ogden and Richards, op. cit., p. 259.</page><page sequence="22">604 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [22] the word "Creator" for other than affective-volitional pur poses has saddled the ages with the task of " reconciling " science and Genesis or of combatting science in the interests of Genesis. Some writers, particularly of the psychoanalytic schools, have a way of stressing the father image as though it were the sole specimen in the repertoire of religion.25 The rock image descending from the days of stone worship, the light image from the days of sun worship, the shepherd image from the days of pastoral life, the king image from the days of monarch worship are perhaps no less affective for stirring the emotions than the father image surviving from the days of ancestor worship. Yet this oversight is trivial compared with another. There should be no overlooking the fact that imagery by itself does not constitute religion. Art also and even psycho neuroses revel in imagery. The vital thing about religious imagery is that it is religious. It is imagery used for a unique purpose, the purpose namely of creating situations which are judged to embody the utmost value. Even when harmfully or ineffectively applied, the imagery of religion is applied with the intent of infusing into life the presence of the supreme ideal. This then is the sense in which God is a Heavenly Father: the father image can be used for creating affective-volitional states which are highly conformable to ultimate ideals. Some psychologists regard the father image as nothing but a device for awakening certain infantile attitudes of trust 25 Sigmund Freud, Leonardo da Vinci, Translated by A. A. Brill, New York, 1916,p. 57; C.G.Jung, The Psychology of the Unconscious, Translated by Beatrice M. Hinkle, New York, 1916, p. 254; Georges Berguer, Some Aspects of the Life of of Jesus, New York, 1923, pp. 40, 247; Johann Kinkel, "The Problem of the Psychological Foundation of the Origin of Religion," Imago, Vol. 8, No. 1; Everett Dean Martin, The Mystery of Religion, New York, 1924, p. 127; Cavendish Moxon, " Religion in the Light of Psychoanalysis," Psychoanalytic Review,Review, Vol. 7, No. 1 ; Pierre Bovet, Le Sentiment Religieux et la Psychologie de l'Enfant,l'Enfant, p. 2j ; Chas.

But is this all that there is to the father image? Why only infantile tendencies? Why not also parental? "Heavenly Father" calls to mind not only the trust which we, as infants, felt toward our parents but also the trust which we, as parents, awaken in our children. And, not only that. Into the web of association, why may not affection for all childhood enter and, still farther expanding, why may not all altruistic sentiments have a part in the father complex, sometimes fainter, sometimes stronger? Everything reported by Kropotkin and by Nasmyth26 on the subject of mutual aid—habits, sentiments, traditions, customs of mutual aid—may, by a familiar psychological process, share in the father image. The psychoanalytic writers have also much to say about the rôle of sex in religion. Speaking psychoanalytically, this can only mean that certain associations or complexes of associations having to do with the procreative process are identical with certain ones that appear in the religious. Or, speaking behavioristically, we would have to say that pro creation and religion have certain neural reflexes or com binations of reflexes in common. Points of identity, however, do not exclude points of difference. Roses contain nitrogen: refuse also contains nitrogen. Yet it hardly follows that roses and refuse are the same thing. The most crucial difference in the world is that of purpose or function. Religion, at least in its more attractive registers, uses sex associations as it does everything else, for the purpose of realizing the supreme good. Religion quotes: " I have loved thee with an everlasting love," " Thy love it is my heart desires," " Let me to Thy bosom fly."27 Shall we say that there is no difference between these attitudes and those of libertinism? All the distance from zenith to nadir lies between sex responses functioning toward one end and sex responses tending toward another. 26 Peter Kropotkin, Mutual Aid as a Factor in Evolution ; George Nasmyth, Social Social Social Progress and the Darwinian Theory, New York, 1916. 27 A striking passage in Succah 54 a asserts that divine love is like sexual love.</page><page sequence="24">606606 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [24] God is then a helper in the sense that the thought of God with its attendant imagery has the effect of dispelling undesirable states of mind and substituting desirable ones. The world must have known long before the advent of Psychoanalysis what a compelling rôle memory plays in human life. Most, perhaps all of our emotions are due less to the prevailing situation than to the memories aroused by that situation—often unconscious memories as the psycho analyst would say (unverbalized responses as the behaviorist prefers to say).28 Not our present predicaments but our memories are the chief object of our hostilities and fears. Our failure to notice this belongs to life's dominant illusions. The bigot, for instance, who directs his shafts at new ideas has his quarrel in reality not with the new ideas but with certain earlier experiences, possibly forgotten childhood experiences, which those new ideas resuscitate. The cardinal task of religion is to substitute solacing and edifying memories for torturing and degrading ones. Even hope, though it refers to the future, achieves in the present by utilizing the past. Now, this very moment, I possess the desirable state of mind owing to the mental sug gestions which my hopes afford. But what is mental sug gestion if not a process based on memory? Gratifying ex periences of the past are imaginatively revived wherever hope can be said to function. Before condemning the otherworld liness of some religions, it may be well to inquire how far the otherworld imagery is indispensable as a device for crowding out foul memories and substituting fair ones. PART TWO Sociological Bearings Having analysed the meaning of the affirmations regard ing divine help, we proceed now to consider the social factors which those several elements of meaning involve. 28 Watson, op. cit., pp. 130, 190, 205.</page><page sequence="25">[a5] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 607 "We shall let an outstanding sociologist provide us with this definition of the word "social": "of or pertaining to a group of individuals who carry on a common life by means of mental interaction."29 The question then before us is: What actions of human beings upon one another can we find displayed in those situations to which people refer when they affirm divine help? Since we have thus far considered divine help affirmations from the standpoint of needs, causes, gradations of value, and expedients, let us observe a parallel procedure now that we are probing into the related social interactions. I.I. NEEDS The needs which are the occasion for the help receiving the appraisal " divine " can be social in at least five different ways:30 (1) Many if not most human troubles consist of unhappy relations between human persons. Poverty, oppression, war, strife, humiliation, neglect, contempt, envy, physical or financial injury, tyranny, insults, lawlessness—the entire gamut of woes which men inflict upon one another and which led Schopenhauer to exclaim, " Homo homini lupus," belong to this category. How inveterately all Utopian literature assumes that when social maladjustments will have ceased, all maladjustments will have ceased! Then "will the threshing reach unto the vintage and the vintage unto the sowing," 31 then " the earth shall answer the grain and the new wine 29 Charles Ellwood, Social Psychology, foot note p. 7. For this reference I am indebted to my friend, Prof. Eubank of the University of Cincinnati. 30 Prof. Eubank advises reference to the " four wishes " of W. I. Thomas, The The Persistence of Primary Group Norms in Present Day Society. These wishes are (1) Security, (2) New Experience, (3) Recognition, (4) Response. Prof. Eubank points out that my numbers 2 and 3 belong by " sympathetic identification " to the desire for security and that my number 4 is essentially a desire for response and number 5 a form of the desire for recognition. Prof. Eubank farther suggests comparison with the " sixfold interest " of Albion W. Small, General Sociology, p. 425 ff. These interests are: (1) Health, (2) Wealth, (3) Knowledge, (4) Beauty, (j) Sociability, (6) Righteousness. 31 Leviticus 26. 5.</page><page sequence="26">608 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [26] and the oil."32 Utopias are strikingly free of droughts, storms, floods, infections—all bold psychological testimony to the dominance of social troubles in the catalogue of human miseries. (2) Needs may furthermore be social in the sense that human beings, by sympathetic identification, partake of one another's sorrows. The illness of a dear one can be a greater tribulation than our own, the knowledge of another's anguish more poignant than our own. This appropriation of others' reverses attains its maximum within the family circle yet readily spreads beyond the family into the broader domains of neighborhood, community, nation and the world. The sinking of the Titanic, the burning of the Iroqois theater, the earthquake in Japan, the famines in China and Russia can harrow the souls of millions who will never look upon the slightest physical vestige of those disasters. From every human calamity the suffering, transmuted into the type called mental, radiates over vast areas. This obviously is a sense in which some of our acutest needs are social. (3) Likewise social are those needs which we commonly designate as moral—the struggle with the surge of primitive impulse, otherwise called " the battle with temptation," the travail, often futile, to carry out in conduct the requirements of accepted moral standards. In so far as moral standards are matters of social inculcation and utility, these needs also must be listed as social. It should be added that not only our own moral success but also that of others can be with us a matter of ardent concern. (4) Furthermore, companionship has its place in the list of human needs. Loneliness can be a dire scourge. Protracted periods of solitary confinement are said to have had insanity as their result. (5) Account must finally be taken of Prof. Cooley's reflection: "In a very large and interesting class of cases the social reference takes the form of a somewhat definite imagination of how one's self... appears in a particular mind, and the kind of self-feeling one has is determined by the 32 Hosea 1. 24.</page><page sequence="27">[27] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 609 attitude toward this attributed to that other mind."38 The good opinion of others, crudely stated, is thus among our needs. Real or supposed lack of that good opinion can be agony. The battlefield is not the only place where death is preferred to social disparagement. Any or all of these needs can acquire transcendant im portance and their satisfaction become a matter of such extra ordinary value as to evoke the characterization " divine." II.II. CAUSES The causative factors in a vast amount of help which is momentous enough to be regarded as divine are other human beings. " Nihil homini homine utilior " says Spinoza. Help which is divine as to its importance can thus be social as to its cause. We have already noticed the psychological " dis placement" which precipitates the impression that the cause is divine. We can not maintain, of course, that all important help is socially caused. Biological, meteorological and psychological factors falling outside of the social domain are constantly operative in the healing of sickness, the saving of crops, and the relief of depression. Still, the rôle played by human beings in most instances of human deliverance is enormous. Very often, biological, meteorological and psychological factors are socially supplemented. The physician and the weather pro gnosticator, the agricultural consultant, the engineer, the ex perimenter, the psychiatrist, even the artist, without whose direction we might have missed finding sunsets and landscapes glorious, represent social augmentations of extra-social boons. In the last analysis, our very bodies, with their organs of sense and sensibility responsive to nature's blights and blessings, are social products. Where the needs are of the five social types listed above, the help must necessarily be social. On social predicaments, how can any but social agents operate, whatever may be the indirect effect of such non-social factors as floods, storms, 33 Op. cit., pp. iji, 152. Also the discussion of the Social Self by Willliam James in The Principles of Psychology, New York, 1899, Vol. I, pp. 293-296. Hebrew Union College Annual V. 39</page><page sequence="28">610 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [28] crops, fire, droughts, rain, sunshine, landscapes and sunsets in the production of human amenities, enmities and conciliations. Everything which falls within the domain of mutual aid, so notably celebrated by Kropotkin and Nasmyth, applies in this connection. Three types of mutual aid require dis crimination: (x) Aid against the hostile forces of nature outside of human life. (2) Aid against hostile human beings. (3) Spiritual aid. (1) The volumes of Kropotkin and Nasmyth deal largely with the aid of the first type. Men rush to one another's rescue from hunger, flood, fire, wild beasts, exposure and disease—not only men but infra-human forms of animal life down to the tiniest insect. (2) No less important for our purpose is the second type of mutual aid where men rescue men from men. This phenomenon must be invoked to explain some outstanding specimens of religious parlance such as the assertions which put God, the helper, on one side and man, the foe, on the other. "" If it had not been the Lord Who was on our side, When men rose up against us; Then they had swallowed us up alive, When their wrath was kindled against us."34 " They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: In the name of the Lord I will cut them off." 35 Yet, even here our thesis holds that the divinity really meant lies not in the cause but in the value of the help and that the cause of the help, even in the face of formidable human hostility, is still something human. It was, after all, not "men" that "rose up against me" but a restricted group of men—the group to which I do not 34 Psalm 124. 2, 3. 35 Psalm 118. 11.</page><page sequence="29">[29][29] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 611 belong arrayed against the group to which I do belong. Exegetically, of course, the "me" in the Biblical passages quoted happens to be the group, that is, the nation or the faithful faction of the nation and not any individual. Yet, even taking the passages homiletically and acknowledging their adequacy as expressions of individual experience to which they have doubtless been applied countless times, we still have a social causation for the rescue from social hostility. My enemies are before me but elsewhere are my friends. They will rescue me if they can. Even if they fail to rescue me, the thought of them is a spiritual factor of great beneficence —as we shall notice presently. Edith Cavel may be in the hands of her foes. Yet, beyond her foes is the wider circle of her own. It is for them that she is struggling and suffering. It is from them that she derives the spiritual help pending the arrival of the physical help which will save her cause although too tardy to save her life. Theirs are the hymns and prayers and the religious tropes which comfort her last hours. "They that are with us are more than they that are With With them." Elisha may have referred to the gleaming angels on the surrounding heights. But even without the mythical angels, his words would have been true. Social presence is something vaster than physical presence. Social presence is unbounded in time or space. The remotest regions and the remotest generations can belong to it. Beyond the hostile Syrian cordon, is the infinite and eternal social situation wherein Elisha has the victory. Nor are human friends, when foes overwhelm, altogether absent even physically. How many a foe is a potential friend! Pocahontas need not have been Captain Smith's only pro tagonist in that dreadful hour. Song and story are fond of the theme. It is not impossible for enemies to become admirers and even helpers. What we noticed at the outset about un expectedness finds striking illustration in the devious ways of social interaction. (3) The third type of aid which we must consider is the spiritual which has already obtained some incidental illustration. What do we mean by the spiritual? In a previous 39</page><page sequence="30">612 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [30] connection, we have asserted that spiritual is an evaluative term, a eulogistic appraisal of situations highly approximative to the highest ideal. We declined to identify the spiritual with the emotional or volitional because emotional and volitional aspects belong also to situations which do not merit that encomium. Still, there is a sense of the word " spiritual " in which affective-volitional experiences do have a dominating place. That place appears to be this: The spiritual is the im portant. The important elicits closer scrutiny than the un important. Affective-volitional factors which are ignored or lightly heeded in unimportant situations gain their due measure of attention when the significant situations arise. This capa city of momentous situations to win closer scrutiny than the non-momentous will account for the rôle played by the " soul," the " heart," the " inner life," &amp;c.—or their behavioristic equivalents—in conjunction with spirituality. Spirituality, of course, does not and can not dispense with " outer " elements. There can be no response except there be a situation to which to respond: there can be no volition without something to be willed. The " outer " is as inseparable from spirituality as the " inner " and the " inner " as inseparable from the ««spiritual as the " outer." The difference is apparently due to the amount of attention elicited by affec tive-volitional occurrences in situations of high value and of low value respectively. The correctness or incorrectness of this explanation however need not effect the salient point which is the part that fellow human beings assume in generating that "inner life of the soul." Can anything even remotely approach in its potency the influence which human beings exert upon one another? Here belong example, impression, imitation, suggestion, congeniality, persuasion—phenomena, in their turn no doubt, reducible to the associations, conscious or unconscious, of Psychoanalysis and the conditioned responses of Behaviorism. How enormous this potency is becomes revealed in the frequency with which people "find God" in their human relations.</page><page sequence="31">[31] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 613 "World, how it walled about Life with disgrace! Till God's own smile came out; That was thy face! " 36 " In thine eyes, my darling," said a dying man to his wife, " have I beheld the Eternal." 37 Who has not seen in the face of a beloved child the face of God? How commonly is the voice of an inspiring prophet, teacher or companion the voice of God! These statements are indeed misleading if the word " God " is taken in its causal sense. But they are literally true when the word carries its usual non-theological sense of value, high value, supreme, superlative value. This is the sense in which God is the comforter of sorrow, a strengthener against temptation, a cleanser of the heart and the essence of that moral rehabilitation which is traditionally called the forgiveness of sin. The circumstance that human contacts can be shown to have been operative in the causation of these benefits does not make them a whit less divine so far as their value is concerned. And, in its spiritual ranges, mutual aid is how signally mutual! Each aids the other by becoming an object of aid for the other and eliciting from that other the proclivity for aiding.38 Herein lies the sense in which irrefutably " God is love," love being that relation in which human beings supremely influence one another toward that state in which supreme values are approximated if not realised. The joy of service, the comfort of self-effacement, the peace that comes with humility, and the blessedness of self-renunciation belong here, the individual, like Sir Galahad, finding himself by losing himself. Here also is exemplified the great doctrine of the intrinsic and indefeasible worth of the individual. The highest good of others is the highest good of each and this is what 36 Robert Browning, " The Two Poets of Croisic." 37 Coe, op. cit., p. 25. 38 Felix Adler, op. cit., p. 171 : "The category of interdependence implies that the lines of energy between A and B cross, so that A is subject to B's influence, B subject to A's influence simultaneously. The simultaneity of the relation distinguishes the category of interdependence from that of causality."</page><page sequence="32">614 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [32] the intrinsic worth of the individual implies. In vain will any highest good be sought by any one person which is not at the same time the highest good of everyone else. III.III. GRADATIONS OF VALUE The very gradation of good into higher and lower which we have found to be so distinctly inseparable from religion is deeply saturated with social presuppositions. The mere fact that the good is matter of discussion, argument and debate betrays this character. Both the attack and the defence of any line of conduct start from the assumption that the good to be sought is the good of all and not merely a good which, benefitting one, excludes another. Anything is bad which fails to realise this assumption; anything is good which does realise it. By far the most frequent use of the words " good " and " bad " is that of relative positions in the line of social inter action. "Bad" is that which is being socially transcended, supplemented, corrected, left behind. " Good " is the prospec tive outcome of such transcending, supplementing and cor recting. " Bad " is an earlier stage of the same journey whereof "good" is a later stage. At any given time, the earlier stage is represented by some persons and tendencies and the later stage by others. Genetically viewed it is plain why this should be so. The individual is ipso facto a member of that larger unit, the race. The individual's activities can be understood only as phases of racial activity. The preservation of the individual is of moment because upon it depends the preservation of the race. When the preservation of the race calls for the sacrifice of the individual, then the sacrifice of the individual becomes of moment whether gloriously on the battle field or igno minously on the gallows. Social pressure tends incessantly to make the mental habits of the individual reflect the interests of the race. To this proposition everything thus far said regarding mutual aid is but the corollary.39 39 Coe, op. cit., p. 39 : " The justification, not to say necessity, for recognizing a simply social function of mind exists not alone in the social presuppositions of several recognized values but also in a long series of genetic studies which, from one angle after another, have revealed the fundamentally social nature of consciousness."</page><page sequence="33">[33] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 615 Behind this racial character of the individual may perhaps be traced the ultimate mystery of the one and the many. Individuals are the many whereof the race is the one. This brings us to the farthest bounds of human thought, the mystery of the one and the many, the eternal and insoluble, bidding the mind of man: "Thus far shalt thou go and no farther." In this sense, the good becomes linked with the infinite and the ineffable. IV. EXPEDIENTS We have already enumerated among the senses in which help can be divine the circumstance that it is at times something psychological obtained through various religious practices such as prayer, ritual, meditation, hope, trust.40 These religious expedients possess the quality appraised as divine: a) when they really help, b) when the help is important and significant. From the days of the ancient prophets to the days of modern anti-clericalism, these religious usages have had the defect of being resorted to long after changing conditions had deprived them of their effectiveness. Still their frequent futility does not gainsay the possibility of their being beneficial on occasion. In a world where most evils and the roots of still more evils lie in the emotions and the will, anything which creates a salutary state of the emotions and the will has every qualification for the encomium " divine." 40 It would be customary to add " faith " but this we shall have to forego because of the misleading character of the word. The word is used in two distinct senses which have been hopelessly confused. One sense is that of the utilisation of certain mental (the Behaviorist would say " verbal ") representations whose effect is deemed to be emotionally and volitionally helpful. The other sense of " faith " is that of a mental attitude in which the difference between evidence and lack of evidence is ignored, almost justifying the witticism ascribed to the school boy who is reported to have said: "Faith is when you believe what you know ain't true." Faith in the second sense is virtually the opposite of faith in the first sense. Erasure of the difference between evidence and lack of evidence produces emotions and volitions which can not be desirable.</page><page sequence="34">616 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [34] In a previous connection, we have compared the use of imagery in religion with its use in art. We have also con sidered some specimens of imagery such as that involving the father experience and that involving the sex experience. We must now draw the distinction between the earlier associations of imagery and later associations. Thus, expressions such as " Heavenly Father " have an impressiveness whose origin lies in the first years of life. The psychology of religion, whatever the school, has the function of tracing such origins. Yet these initial experiences are not the only ones contributing to the associational content of religious phrases. Much to their associational enrichment, there have been, subsequent to childhood, innumerable occasions upon which these phrases have been used. They may have been spoken by a beloved mother,41 teacher, prophet or friend. They may have become glorified through entrancing music or aureoled in masterpieces of art. We may well question whether infantile associations are^necessarily more potent than those arising at a later date. With certain phrases, the associational content is in a state of constant growth. Expressions like "God bless you," " God will take care of you," " God give thee peace," " Holy Spirit," " The peace that passeth understanding "42 have served so perennially to vocalize affection and good will as to have become a special vocabulary of affection and good will. The beloved persons not only by whom but also to whom these words are spoken augment their associational 41 The immense rôle played in religion by filial respect has a bearing upon this point. Religion is still identified with piety, that is pietas, filial devotion. In Judaism as elsewhere numerous usages are avowedly observed for no other reason than that of honoring parents or even remoter ancestors. Some anthropo logists would have us understand that ancestor worship constituted the beginning or an early stage of some or of all religions. 42 " The peace of God that passeth understanding " admits of being understood in terms of social psychology. Various human contacts, memories, expectations, artistic and literary achievements have been psychologically instrumental in producing that peace. The peace is " of God " in the sense of its being wholesome, excellent, desirable, an exceptional embodiment of value. A mare accurate phrasing would be " passeth expectation</page><page sequence="35">[35] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 617 wealth. The power of this love and friendship is surely not less than that of .infantile recollection or sex reminiscence. Along these lines also the attempt can be made to account for the reputed efficacy of prayer that one person offers in behalf of another. Prayer is the manifestation of one's interest in that other, of that good will, appreciation, esteem—of that understanding, at least, which we have already listed among the urgent social needs. "Pray for me" denotes: "Take an interest in me. Be concerned about me. Influence me helpfully." The benefit of the prayer lies in the beneficence of the one who offers the prayer while the God addressed in the prayer is that supreme good which, through it all, is being visaged and approached. Conversely, when the associations are repellent, religious phraseology becomes hateful and atheism is the result. Atheism, as we have seen, differs from theism only in the matter of nomenclature. A tyrannical parent, a bigoted teacher, a reac tionary church, a mawkish or superstitious congregation can render any set of phrases obnoxious and provocative of dissent. Finally, it should be noticed how extensively the phraseo logy of religion refers to inanimate objects: light, tower, fortress, rock, sea, See. Unless we can trace these figures back to the days of fetichism when inanimate objects were anthropo morphised, we may have to regard these phrases as being without a primary social basis. By virtue of their religious appropriation and repeated usage they become social in a secondary way. Thus help, which is divine as to its value, can be social as to its expedients in addition to being social as to its cause. CONCLUSION י Jewish Bearings As we began with a reflection on the Jewish bearings of our theme, it may be well to end with a similar reflection. That the God of Jewish tradition is a causative God can not be denied. Still it is significant that Theology which is responsible for the causal conception plays, in Jewish tradition,</page><page sequence="36">618 ABRAHAM CRON3ACH [36] a rôle much inferior to that of worship; and in worship, as we have seen, causation is, if broached at all, hardly more than a symbol of value. Have we not, in the preceding pages, had occasion to quote Jewish liturgie phrases when illustrating the evaluative conception of Deity? Even in Jewish Theology, the age-long struggle against anthropomorphism may in a measure have been due to a per ception, however dim, that causative categories fail to compass the Divine. A causal God must needs be an anthropomorphic God: such a vast part of observable causation is human, Divine causation could hardly be other than quasi-human. The Jewish insurgency against anthropomorphism which reaches its climax in Maimonides but which has often been traced through the Targumim back into the Massoretic text and possibly into still earlier manifestations is by no means unrelated to a feel ing that not causation but value is the meaning of Divinity. Passages can, in fact, be quoted in which the idea that the causally human can be evaluatively divine is almost ex plicit. There is, for instance, the passage in Leviticus Rabba 34,2 to the effect that the benevolent person, as it were, deprives God of the merit of giving bread to all flesh.43 There is also the passage in Leviticus Rabba 34, 16 to the effect that as a " repairer of the breach " the benevolent person is God's surrogate.44 Likewise how significant in this connection are the famous utterances in Abot chapter 3, paragraphs 3 and 7, asserting the presence of the Divine where human beings assemble under exalted conditions! Nor is the conception of human beings who, like the prophets, function as messengers of God, without kinship with these views. The Shebet Musar 2, 5 has the pregnant phrase: "He imparteth unto His creatures some of the mercy which is His."45 Human mercy is here identified with divine 43 Leviticus Rabba 34. 2 quoting Psalms 136.23 and 145. 13 : נותן לחט לכל בשי נא זה וחטף לו את המצות. 44 Leviticus Rabba 34• 6 ז quoting Isaiah 38. 12 : וקורא לך גודר פרץ. ו־ אנין בשם ר' נדניה אמר. אמר הק"נה. הפרצה הזו היה עלי לגודרה. עמדת אתה ונחרת אותה חייך שאני מעלה עליך ונו'• 45 Shebet Musar 2. 5 : נותן לבריות טרחמיו.</page><page sequence="37">[37] DIVINE HELP AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON 619 mercy—which is all but saying that something which is in some ways human is, at the same time, divine evaluatively. Then there are the Jewish affirmations that friendship is divine46 and, above all, the vast amount said about the sacred implications of charity. Again and again is God re presented in the Bible, the Midrash, the Talmud and the Ethical Writers either as enjoining charity or as rewarding charity or as both. This, to be sure, is not a clear cut assertion that charity is the causative where the divine is the evaluative. Yet, in view of what has already been said about psycho logical " displacements " can these charity teachings be dis missed as altogether irrelevant? How readily can "God is the commander of benevolence," " God is the rewarder of benevolence" be displacements for "God is the value to be realized through benevolence " ? Considering the doctrinal background of Jewish charity teachings, could there have been any greater approximation to our doctrine of social cause, divine value? Indeed a momentous practical inference follows. If the traditional declarations about the divinity of benevolence are to mean anything in modern terms they must mean the negation of what an ultra-progressive Jew of today calls provisionalism in social service. He writes: "There are two fallacies that affect the social reform movements of today. The substitution of power for right is one. What I venture to call the fallacy of provisionalism is the second. This is the fallacy of the opportunist movements. c Lead the laboring classes provisionally up to the level of sufficiency, or of decent existence, and then we shall see.' But man does not act without ends, and unless we define the ultimate end, we give license to the proximate ends. In other words we simply cannot act provisionally. We cannot ignore our spiritual nature without offend ing against it. We may start with the idea of serving 46 Jerushalmi Berakot I 3c and IV 7d: השוכן בנית היה יטע ביניכם אחוה ואהבה שלוט ורעות: שתשכן כפודינו אהבה ואדווה ושלום וריעות.</page><page sequence="38">620 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [38] it, but without explicit definition of it we shall pre sently find ourselves disgraced in all sorts of idola tries." 47 If we are right in our contention that the dominant meaning of God is supreme value, it follows that the Jewish linkage of benevolence and God calls for the realization through benevolence of supreme values and not merely proximate ones. The mere feeding, clothing and sheltering of the body is a counterfeit benevolence. Benevolence must create or, at least aim to create a strengthened, a harmonious and a beautified personality in each of the parties involved. Provisionalistic social service or reform is as much out of keeping with the spirit of traditional Judaism as it is with the spirit of the ultra-modernized Jew from whom quotation has just been made. The great Midrash on benevolence, Leviticus Rabba, actually states, 34, 16, that peace between the suffering in dividual on the one hand and God on the other is one of the most significant possibilities of benevolence.48 We need not overlook its essential naivete in order to credit this passage with at least some dim perception that spiritual goals to benevolence are of profound importance. Not trivial values, then, but superlative ones must be sought in social work if we are to translate into modern reactions the ancestral view that charity is divine. Trivial values are not divine. Only exalted values are divine. That the soul and not merely the flesh must be the aim of all social endeavor is thus a conviction in which the teachings of the past and the insights of the present strikingly coincide. 47 Felix Adler, An Ethical Philosophy of Life, London and New York, 1918, P. 53. 48 Leviticus Rabba 34.16: א"ר יהודה ב"ד סימון. העני הזה יושב ומתרעם. מה אני מה פלוני הוא ישן על מטתו ואני ישן כאן סלוני ישן נניתו ואני כאן. ועמדת אתה ונתת לו חייך שאני מעלה עליך כאילו עשית שלום ניני לנינו</page></plain_text>
