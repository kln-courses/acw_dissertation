One of the vessels was unearthed in the central highlands of Mexico; the other derives from the Peten region of Guatemala. The former is an Olmec vase or urn from Chalcatzingo (Morelos, Mexico), probably unearthed during the 1960s and now in a private collection. The latter is the lid of a Maya cache vessel consisting of two large plates set lip-to-lip that was excavated at an undetermined time in the Tikal region of the Guatemalan Peten; it is currently in the Art Museum of Princeton University. Linear, sparse, and angular, the Olmec iconography herein considered stands in sharp contrast to the more rounded, flowing, curvilinear iconography of the Maya, with its tendency to fill all available space. Yet it is obvious that both vessels are focally concerned with a centrally located, leftward-facing disembodied head having vegetal accoutrements and resting on a pedestal within a quadripartite iconographie frame. Moreover, it is almost certain that both vessels depict not only a bloodletting theme but also a maize theme, the centrally placed disembodied head representing the harvested ear of maize. Furthermore, both share terrestrial symbolism on the bottom, a torch on the left side, shell elements on the right, and top compositional elements having common formal and symbolic attributes. Finally, a similar pattern of internal structural and conceptual replication can be observed on both vessels. The cosmological symbolism of the two vessels' incised images is sufficiently similar to posit an underlying Mesoamerican symbol system that endured through large segments of space and time with recognizable and quite limited variation in form and thematic content. This conclusion can be supported by a large body of Mesoamerican iconography, but a comparison of the two vessels' maize and blood symbolism in a cosmological context is particularly This paper has benefited from comments and criticisms of Becky Brimacombe to whom thanks are due. instructive. Among other things the comparison supports the contention, now independently proposed by other researchers on other grounds, that both vessels contain bloodletting imagery (Grove 1987; Schele and Miller 1986), and that what might be termed the Mesoamerican cosmogram is a salient and enduring component of Mesoamerican iconography identifiable on both vessels. Moreover, the premise of shared symbolism permits the inference that several symbols later known as Maya glyphs, as well as elements of the Classic Maya "Quadripartite Badge," have descended from earlier forms having structural analogues that can be specifically identified on an Olmec vessel.

Stylistic evidence indicates that it was manufactured during the late Middle Formative period, around 600 b.c. (Grove 1987: 61-62). Its central figure is a disembodied? perhaps decapitated?head, enclosed in a frame of two posts and two knotted ribbons, and surrounded in the four directions by four isolable images. The two images on the sides are separate from the frame, whereas the top and bottom images are in contact with it. A torch ?mage decorates the left side; on the right side there is a "knuckle-duster" (cf. Grove 1987). On top a "crossed bands" motif is surmounted by a "maize crown" complex; on the bottom is an "earth" pedestal. A pattern of structural (position and form) and conceptual (meaning or function) replication occurs within the iconography of the Chalcatzingo Vase. The top image complex, for example, shares its groove, or "cleft," and sprouting maize features with the top part of the central figure, the disembodied head. The torch on the left side shares general form and, I suspect, components of meaning with the forehead ornament to the left of the disembodied head, while the sharpened "bloodletter elements" at the torch's tip and on the cuff behind the torch's hand share conceptual "sharpness" with the "bird beak/shark tooth" and "recurving fangs" in the mouth of the leftward-facing disembodied head. On the right the "knuckle-duster" image formally resembles the outline of the knotted cloth behind the head (i.e., to the right of it). Moreover, scalloping like that on the knuckle-duster can be found on the back of the head, and the curved line in the hand holding the knuckle-duster seems to mimic the one in the central knot behind the head. Finally, on the bottom section of the Chalcatzingo Vase, a dimly perceivable "foot" (under the crossed bands flanked by triple pendants on which the head rests) can be compared with the earth panel that constitutes the bottom element of the scene. Princeton Plate Figure 2 illustrates the incised scene on the flat bottom of the cache vessel known as the Princeton Plate; the glyphs on the periphery occur on the plate's short side. Inferentially dated to the Early Classic (a.d. 350-500) and stylistically identified with the Maya Tikal region of the Guatemalan Peten, this ceramic plate is 35.9 cm in diameter and 5.7 cm in height (Schele and Miller 1986: 195). "Known in particular from Late Preclassic and Early Classic buildings, these caches were placed under floors during dedication rites, and contained offerings such as decapitated heads, flint blades, stingray spines, thorns of Figure 2. Princeton Plate. (After original drawing by Linda Schele; cf. also Schele and Miller 1986: pi. 75.) various types, and sea fans, coral, sponges and other material imported from the sea" (Schele and Miller 1986: 195). The central icon on this plate is the disembodied head of the young Maize God, resting from one point of view, in a Kin ("sun") bowl such as may be seen as the forehead of the Quadripartite Monster. "Here, it has a square-nosed dragon drawn across the Kin sign, and it rests atop the head of Bolon Mayel, a little-understood god who appears mostly in glyphic form" (Schele and Miller 1986: 195). In front of the Maize God's face are depicted "the three primary blood-letting lancets?an obsidian blade, a stingray spine, and a flint knife. Kan-cross and bone-bead signs qualify the water pattern in the background as blood, indicating that the entire image floats in blood" (Schele and Miller 1986: 195). Although the four glyphs (properly, glyph collocations) surrounding this vessel suggest four different orientations for the Princeton Plate because their tops all face the center of the vessel, only two possible orientations for the vessel produce an iconographie whole. First, the Kin bowl on the zoomorph head, with the triad of bloodletting implements taken as an entity resembling the Quadripartite Badge, can be placed on a vertical axis. Alternatively, the disembodied head resting on a</page><page sequence="4">Stross: Maize and blood 85 Figure. 3. Chalcatzingo Vase and Princeton Plate.

For purposes of comparison with the Chalcatzingo Vase, we will adopt this latter orientation for up, down, left, and right. As with the Chalcatzingo Vase, the Princeton Plate has a pattern of internal structural and conceptual replication relating the four outer elements (here glyphs) to similarly placed iconographie features in the central area (see fig. 3). Starting at the top, the Ix glyph and the possible maize leaf above it resemble by both name and concept (maize leaf?both kernel and ear?are Maya ix-im), the maize so clearly represented on top of the disembodied head. The glyph for the day Ix (jaguar) refers to an animal more commonly named balam, or a cognate in Mayan languages, relevant here because in contemporary Yucatec the balam is a "guardian of the milpa," a "protecting spirit of the cornfield" (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962: 112-113). In the Maya divinatory veintena of twenty named days, the day Kan is in paired opposition to Ix and shares some components of meaning with it (Strass 1983: 246-249). In our example, the glyph for Kan (maize kernel) adorns the headdress on the Princeton Plate, while the glyph for Ix (jaguar) is in the top glyph collocation. The two Caban (earth) glyphs in the bottom glyph collocation together enclose two pairs of (darkened) circlets, which can be compared in form and position to the two pairs of (blood) circlets just below the disembodied head. More important, the latter two pairs of circlets combine with the bar above them to form the number nine in Maya notation: nine is the number of the earth lord and of the underworld, appropriately replicated in concept by the Caban (earth) glyphs in the collocation below. The curve of the torch in the left-hand glyph collocation mirrors the curve of the flint blade to the left of the central head. Torch and flint are more readily understood as comparable when it is recalled that in Mesoamerican tradition flint is the "fire-stone" from which sparks are struck to produce fire. The darkened jaguar spots in the left-hand glyph collocation, argued below to represent the west and sundown, are conceptually linked to the Akbal (night) glyphic infix on</page><page sequence="5">86 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 TABLE 1.

Finally, the only zoomorphic head to be found among the four glyph collocations is on the right-hand side. It is conceptually replicated by the zoomorphic head of Bolon Mayel placed to the right of (i.e., behind) the central disembodied head. We have seen so far that the Olmec vase and the Maya plate, although distant from each other in space and time, each exhibit internal formal and thematic replication by means of the placement of iconographie elements. One purpose for such replication would seem to be reinforcement through duplication. Another reason for replication would be to allow for elaboration without dissipating the structural format itself, whose meaning shall be discussed below. II. The Chalcatzingo Vase and the Princeton Plate compared Discussed separately, the Chalcatzingo Vase and Princeton Plate are only indirectly compared. They can also be profitably placed side by side and compared point for point (fig. 3). This is best done by first considering the peripheral elements separately?glyphs on the Princeton Plate and structurally comparable images on the Chalcatzingo Vase. Table 1 summarizes these comparisons, which are taken up one by one in explanatory detail below. Peripheral glyphs and images Top. The Princeton Plate's top glyph collocation has a small brush of "hairs" over three almost horizontal circlets, a combination known as the Ix glyph (T821). It is matched on the Chalcatzingo Vase by a brush of "hairs" and three horizontally positioned circlets. On the Chalcatzingo Vase, however, the hairs and the circlets are separated by a unitary feature: crossed bands with flanking triple horizontal pendants.1 The brush of "hairs" on the Chalcatzingo Vase, moreover, has within it a three-pronged element resembling the "tripartite maize" (Joralemon's motif no. 89; 1971:13) that emerges from clefts in Olmec figures. It appears to correspond, in combination with the three circlets below it, to the "personified trees" found on both Kaminaljuyu Stela 11 and on the Dumbarton Oaks Jade Celt (fig. 4). These "personified trees" in turn resemble the right-hand element of the triadic portion of the Quadripartite Badge (fig. 5), a point to be recalled below. A Princeton Plate homologue bearing conceptual but not formal resemblance might be found in the elongated element between the Ix glyph and the adjacent circlets identified below as the Ahpo glyph that are in the top glyph collocation. This may represent a maize leaf, an identification reinforced by its resemblance to a three quarters view of the top central element of the Quadripartite Badge, which is often a stingray spine bloodletter (see fig. 5). Sky imagery as well as maize imagery can be found in the top elements of both the Chalcatzingo Vase and Princeton Plate. Schele and Miller read the top glyph collocation on the Princeton Plate as Ahpo-lx "Lord Jaguar" (1986:195), because the Ix glyph represents the day Ix (jaguar) of the twenty divinatory day names. But the three circlets and the brush of hairs composing this Ix glyph greatly resemble a significant portion of the Maya Sky glyph, T561c (fig. 6). Mindful of the present-day 1. This form and those represented on the Humboldt Celt (fig. 7) and the Dallas Plaque (fig. 15) are almost identical to the Maya glyph known as T563 (fire) and also (but for its bend) to the glyph known as the "sky elbow" (T187) that is currently understood to represent a phonetic spelling of the word k'aba, or "name." The fact that the Mixe word for "sun" also means "name" may also be related.</page><page sequence="6">Stross: Maize and blood 87 Dumbarton Oaks jade Kaminaljuyu Stela 11 Personified trees Figure 4.

Com pared with "leaP on top glyph collocation on Princeton Plate. (From Robertson 1985: fig. 89.) Figure 6. Maya "Sky" glyph, T561c. Tzotzil belief (Guiteras-Holmes 1961: 292) that the thirteen sky gods are personified in the jaguar, and the Yucatec belief in balam ("jaguar") as "guardian of the milpa," as well as other arguments that the Ix jaguar can be related both to the sky and to maize in Classic Maya thought (Stross 1983: 248-249), I infer that the top glyph collocation, including the Ahpo (lord) glyph, conveys the epithets "Lord of Heaven" (Ix) or "Lord of the Milpa" (Ix/ Balam). The two epithets would address the same deity, perhaps also equivalent to the sun at Zenith. An additional component of the Chalcatzingo Vase's top ?mage is a "crossed bands and flanking triple pendants" motif, which underlines the sky imagery noted above; but maize imagery is also implied. For example, Taube has called attention to this image on a "dynastic" bundle in conjunction with a spotted k'an glyph (1985: 178, fig. 7d). He argues that such bundles depict maize within, but maize "used as a metaphor for other valued substances, such as jade and blood" (Taube 1985: 178). In accord with this identification, the triple pendants under a brush of "hairs" on the Chalcatzingo Vase clearly suggest maize kernels on a maize ear with corn silk flowing from the top end. It is notable, moreover, that on Izapa Stela 25 (a late Preclassic non-Mayan monument) triple pendants similar to those flanking the crossed bands on the Humboldt Celt (fig. 7) represent blood flowing from the stump of an amputated arm. Bottom. The bottom ?mage on the Chalcatzingo Vase is a single unit resembling feet; it corresponds positionally to both the double Caban (earth) glyphs on the Princeton Plate and to the bar with four dots just above them. The Chalcatzingo vessel's basal ?mage is a terrestrial panel, representing earth. It corresponds precisely to "mask panels"?basically "jaws" with inward turning "canines"?found both at Kaminaljuyu (e.g., Stela 11, fig. 8) and at Izapa (e.g., Stela 4, fig. 9) (cf. Stross and Reilly, in press), although on the Chalcatzingo Vase the "incisors" of the Kaminaljuyu and Izapa terrestrial "jaws" appear to have migrated away from the central position. Left Side. The design unit on the left side of the Chalcatzingo Vase is composed of a disembodied right hand holding a bundle of five tied sticks with a triangular brushlike top that may represent the flames of a torch.2 This bundle of sticks corresponds both in position and form? five sticks with two bands on the upper section?to the bound bundle of sticks that comprise the torch in the glyph collocation on the left side of the Princeton Plate. 2. This "torch/bloodletter" was later to become, I suspect, the hand held fringed af/af/("dart thrower") symbolizing power (and lightning) on late and Postclassic Maya and Toltec political iconography.</page><page sequence="7">88 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 Figure 7.

Principal Bird Deity akbal ruler's face - World Tree bird mask cape censor terrestial panel Figure 8. Kaminaljuyu Stela 11. (After Cortez 1986, fig. 75.) Schele and Miller identify this glyph collocation on the Princeton Plate's rim as "Tah-Balam-Ahau (a torch in front of an ahau sign half covered with jaguar skin), one of the names of GIN from his birth passage on the Tablet of the Sun at Palenque" (1986: 195). A recent reinterpretation of the half-covered ahau attributes to it a logographic value of way "animal spirit companion" (Houston and Stuart 1989); when the quincunx is infixed as on the Princeton Plate, the reading (approximately wayeb), refers to "bed," or some other "sleeping place" (Houston and Stuart 1989: 11). Prefixed by the torch, read tah by Schele and Miller, we can read the full collocation on the left side of the Princeton Plate as ta WAY-eb, alternatively glossable as "to bed," "torch bed," or "arrive at bed," all three of which in a cosmological context would refer to the western resting place of the sun as it descends at sunset. The torch itself is symbolically appropriate here, for in the dark underworld it is a necessity.3 3. The element group on the left side of the Chalcatzingo Vase, in addition to having a structural correspondence with the glyph colloca tion on the left side of the Princeton Plate, also corresponds formally and positionally to the three bloodletting instruments on the Princeton Right Side. The image on the Chalcatzingo Vase's right side is a left hand holding what has been called the Olmec "knuckle-duster" (cf. Grove 1987), identified by Wyllys Andrews as a conch shell (personal communication, 1986). It may function in this case as a baton of office. The seven scallops suggest a shell referent (Andrews's identification of it as such appears to corroborate this conclusion). The Princeton Plate has a deity head image, in the corresponding position, wearing an "oyster shell ear" with Plate, the bottom one with its Akbal infix corresponding to the left and representing the dark side. This structural correspondence follows from the fact as noted that the blood letters also correspond within the Princeton Plate to the glyph on the left, which may represent the west or sunset. The Akbal infixed Pseudo Inverted Fist (T712 [504]), the lowest of the group of three bloodletters (cf. fig. 10c), is identifiable as an obsidian lancet. Its Olmec homologue can be found in the Chalcatzingo Vase's leftward hand with its two infixed circlets; the Princeton Plate's central stingray spine is analogous to the cuff on this hand. The right element of the Princeton Plate's bloodletter triad, the eccentric flint shaped like a "finger," corresponds in general shape, relative size, and some element of detail (e.g., triplicity of circlets on end of one, triple pendants on the end of the other) to the torch on the right side of the Chalcatzingo Vase.</page><page sequence="8">Stross: Maize and blood 89 Figure 9. Izapa Stela 4. (After Cortez 1986, fig. 71.) something that resembles scalloping at the rear.4 Schele and Miller identify the deity as Chac-Xib-Chac (1986: 195), either closely related to or an aspect of Gl (Schele and Miller 1986: 60). Gl, a Classic Maya deity that can be equated with Hunahpu of the Quiche Popol Vuh, is associated with Venus and also the sun (Schele and Miller 1986: 48), and perhaps the sun at sunrise (Marvin Cohodas, personal communication, 1989).5 Figure 10. Chalcatzingo Vase and Princeton Plate comparing triad of bloodletting implements to elements on both vessels. The seven scallops on the Chalcatzingo Vase's right side, if they can be taken to have numerological significance, also suggest the eastern direction. Cohodas associates the Maya "seven deity," sometimes known as Uc Ek-Kan (Schele and Miller 1986: 52), with the reborn sun deity of the east (1986: 169). If we can extend this directional symbolism of the number seven back into Olmec times?something that must be done with proper caution?it gives the disembodied hands of the Chalcatzingo Vase an east-west orientation, leaving the top as the zenith direction (the heavens) and the bottom as nadir (the earth). Given the likelihood that an east-west axis can be established from the iconography, in addition to the readily confirmed zenith/nadir axis, it is then clear that the four peripheral images on both the Chalcatzingo Vase and the Princeton Plate contain directional significance (fig. 10). This strongly suggests that in the vessels' iconography we have cosmograms: iconographie manifestations of a people's cosmology employing a small number of carefully selected significant and multivalent symbols. 4. The scallops on the cuff of the Chalcatzingo Vase's knuckle-duster suggest the conchoidal fractures resulting from pressure flaking of an obsidian knife blade and thereby recall the T188 "Le" glyph prefixed to the deity depicted on the Princeton Plate's right side. I have proposed that this glyph may derive from a representation of a pressure flaked stone knife blade (Stross 1982: 93-95), although the glyph is generally identified by others as a leaf. 5. The Princeton Plate's glyph collocation on the right side includes a T188 "Le" prefix, analogous to the "torch" prefix of the glyph on the left side, possibly indicating a title, as interpreted by Schele and Miller (1986: 195). For example, this T188 prefix precedes an Ahau half covered by jaguar skin as a name or title of Palenque's ruler Chan Bahlum on the Tablet of the Sun (at position K1 ).</page><page sequence="9">90 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 TABLE 2.

Further structural analysis, comparing elements of the central images on the Chalcatzingo Vase and Princeton Plate, both reinforces the conclusion of structural comparability and establishes the great degree of detail with respect to the shared iconography. Table 2 inventories comparable elements of the two vessels' central ?mages. The disembodied head. The central feature of both the Chalcatzingo Vase and the Princeton Plate, a disembodied head (fig. 11), in each case surely represents a supernatural being in its anthropomorphic manifestation or guise. These heads have structural elements in common, such as (1) a sharpened top front tooth, (2) recurved "fangs" at back of mouth, (3) doubly outlined mouth area, (4) maize symbols at top of head, (5) a forehead ornament, (6) hair at rear of head, (7) a "heavenly" pedestal below the head,6 and (8) a very similar "foot-shaped" pedestal. Both heads almost certainly represent the Maize God. The Chalcatzingo Vase head is cloven at the top with a V-shaped maize sprout emerging from the fissure. Four circlets are lined up in a vertical column along the head's cleft; a horizontal crescent cuts through the column 6. Stross and Reilly have demonstrated the intersubstitutability in Maya epigraphy and in Formative iconography between the crossed bands and the single diagonal band (curved or straight), often referred to as a mirror (in press: 8-10, 14).</page><page sequence="10">Stross: Maize and blood 91 Figure 11.

Figure 12. Olmec celt of unknown provenience. (After Covarrubias 1957, fig. 33.) where the head's eye should be. On the Princeton Plate a similar crescent represents the bottom edge of the Maize God's eye, and figure 12 depicts an Olmec celt of unknown provenience, on which a profile view of a disembodied head quite similar to that of the Chalcatzingo Vase has a more elaborated crescent where the eye should be. Moreover, the celt's crescent, found below the cleft in the head from which vegetation emerges, is the bowl part of a "crossed bands in a bowl" motif (Joralemon's motif no. 102) that resembles the Princeton Plate's Kin bowl. The presence of the "crescent"/"bowl" suggests possible Olmec antecedents for the Princeton Plate's Kin bowl; moreover, as a structural analogue to the Kin bowl, it suggests that Olmec crossed bands may have represented the sun in at least one context. This provides additional evidence of the structural and conceptual replication between the outer element groups and features on the disembodied head itself: the Chalcatzingo Vase's crescent may be linked to the crossed bands above it. In front of the Chalcatzingo Vase head, a forehead ornament identified as the edible portion of a crayfish corresponds to a similarly shaped element that can be interpreted as a variant of the Maya Ti glyph (T59) found at the top of the head on the Princeton Plate (fig. 11 a). In addition to the formal similarity between the Olmec crayfish and the Maya "Ti" glyph, it has been argued that there are also semantic connections (Stross 1989).7 At the back of the Chalcatzingo Vase head is a knotted cloth or hairdo with three "thatched" layers on the basal section. This corresponds positionally to the Kin bowl of the Princeton Plate, but only vaguely resembles it in form. It is much more likely to be a homologue of the maize kernel and the ear of maize sprouting from the top of the 7. Interpreting the Maya homologue of the Olmec crayfish as a variant of the Maya "Ti" glyph does not preclude interpreting the latter as a variant of the "black" glyph (as proposed by Mary Ellen Gutierrez, personal communication, 1990), a critical element, together with a Wan cross, for identifying the Maya deity linked to the number seven. Wil liam Harrison has proposed that Maya deities connected with seven and with nine frame the Maize deity (associated with number eight) or the ruler impersonating the Maize deity (personal communication, 1989). The Princeton Plate, in its extraordinary ambiguity, has a central maize deity equivalent to the number eight, in that the head variant of the Maya number eight is the Maize deity. Below the disembodied head is the number nine (part of the "nine" deity's name, Bolon Mayel); above is the Ix (jaguar) glyph, implying the "jaguar" god, patron of number seven, and of the day name Akbal (night, darkness). In this way, seven and nine frame the Maize deity. In front of the Maize deity there are both an Akbal (night, darkness) glyph and plausibly also a "black" glyph next to a Wan cross, identifying the "seven" deity (named Uc-Ek-Kan); in back of the Maize deity's head there is the head of the "nine" deity. Again, seven and nine frame the Maize deity (number eight).</page><page sequence="11">92 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 Maize God's head on the Princeton Plate: the Princeton Plate's kernel corresponds to the Chalcatzingo Vase's knot; the Princeton Plate's maize ear corresponds to the top end of the Chalcatzingo Vase's knotted cloth; and the Princeton Plate's three vegetal volutes around the maize ear correspond to the three "thatched" layers on the basal section of the knotted cloth on the Chalcatzingo Vase. The knuckle-duster on the right side of the Chalcatzingo Vase formally resembles the Kin bowl variant on the Princeton Plate, with its "Ik" or Tau shape, but functionally, the Kin bowl as a receptacle for the disembodied head has its analogue in the Chalcatzingo Vase's frame of two verticals joined by top and bottom knotted ribbons. Kent Reilly has suggested that the knot of the Chalcatzingo Vase's middle knotted ribbon is not visible because it is untied in order to display the contents of an Olmec ritual "bundle" portrayed on the Chalcatzingo Vase (personal communication, 1989). This interpretation would see an Olmec "bundle" corresponding to an Early Classic Maya Kin bowl. The suggestion is lent plausibility by discoveries made at Tikal of cloth "bundles" found within terra-cotta cache vessels. Maize headdress. The maize vegetation emerging from the cleft at the top of the Chalcatzingo Vase head is comparable positionally and functionally to the elaborate maize headdress emerging as maize seed kernel, foliage, and ear from the top of the disembodied head of the Princeton Plate's Maize God.8 Figure 13, a detail from a Late Postclassic Maya mural, shows a Maize God with a cloven head and a maize kernel in the form of the Kan glyph wedged within the cleft. Whereas the Kan glyph maize kernel of this Postclassic mural represents a continuity of tradition stretching back to the Early Classic Princeton Plate, the cleft containing maize recalls the much earlier Middle Preclassic Olmec Chalcatzingo Vase. Shown together on the later artifact, these traits separately depicted on the earlier ones constitute evidence linking Princeton Plate and Chalcatzingo Vase maize headdresses even more closely. 8. The maize ear, foliage, and kernel image corresponds both to the Chalcatzingo Vase's knotted cloth on the Maize God's head (as homo logue), and to the maize vegetation emerging from the cleft at the top of the Maize God's head (as positional and functional analogue). It is also argued that the Princeton Plate's Kan maize kernel can be seen as a conflation of the four Y elements on the Chalcatzingo Vase (functional analogues). This implies a situation in which one element on the Princeton Plate corresponds to three on the Chalcatzingo Vase; it repre sents a conflation rather than a proliferation over time. This is particularly unexpected in that the Olmec vessel represents the sparse composition as opposed to the more elaborate composition on the Maya vessel. Figure 13. Detail from Late Postclassic mural in Structure 44, Tancah, Quintana Roo. (After Morley et al. 1983, fig. 13.33.) Free-floating elements: Seeds and blood. Four free floating Y-shaped design elements on the Chalcatzingo Vase are not found on the Princeton Plate. Given their placement and their relative complexity of form compared to circlets, they correspond best to the four glyphs comprising the two Ahpo glyph collocations (T168) at the top and at the bottom of the Princeton Plate's incised scene (fig. 3I). The Ahpo glyphs, and particularly their seedlike po elements, have been identified by various Mayanists as representations of eyes and/or seeds ("seed" and "eye" being the same word in some Mayan languages). Whether or not the Ahpo glyphs on the Princeton Plate represent seeds, evidence indicates that at least the Y elements on the Chalcatzingo Vase represent seeds. Their structural placement and form are similar to four sprouting clefts on an Olmec jade celt from Arroyo Pesquero that surely represent sprouting maize kernels and that have a sprouting counterpart on top of the head of the depicted individual (fig. 14). The Y elements also correspond in position to four similarly composed elements surrounding the central (maize) plant on the Dallas Plaque (fig. 15), as well as to four offerings similarly placed around the head of the Maize God on page 34 of the Dresden Codex (fig. 16), three of which include the Kan (maize kernel) glyph. Moreover, the Y shape of the four elements on the Chalcatzingo Vase is like a stylization of the Kan (maize kernel) glyph, particularly as represented atop the disembodied head of the Maize God on the Princeton Plate. Because they are four in number, surrounding the "houselike" container on the Chalcatzingo Vase in which the disembodied head is resting, and Y-shaped, it is possible that the Y elements secondarily represent the</page><page sequence="12">Stross: Maize and blood 93 tri-lobed buccal mask ceremonial Figure 14. Arroyo Pesquero Celt. Drawing: F. Kent Reilly. (Cf. also Joralemon 1976: fig. 8f.) four house poles located in the four corners of Maya houses. Notably, these house poles are metaphoric "pillars of the cosmos," said to be sown like seeds in some Mayan languages (with the same word used for planting, e.g., Tzeltal tz'un; Choi tz'Ap).9 In addition to the free-floating Y elements, four free floating circlets also adorn the Chalcatzingo Vase. These correspond to the two pairs of free-floating circlets on the Princeton Plate, and perhaps, like them, symbolize blood. Schele and Miller argue that the Princeton Plate's circlets represent water elements qualified as blood by Wan cross and bone-bead signs, "indicating that the entire ?mage floats in blood" (1986: 195). The free-floating elements, Y's and circlets, referencing seeds and blood respectively, thus symbolize transformational equivalents; blood can be transformed Figure 16. Dresden Codex, page 34, top register. (From Villacorta and Villacorta 1930.) into seeds and vice versa according to Mayan cosmological traditions. They are simply different surface manifestations of the same underlying sacred substance. Knotted ribbons. There are three knotted ribbons on the Chalcatzingo Vase: two form the top and bottom portions of the frame within which rests the disembodied head; the head substitutes for the knot of the third ribbon (or alternatively the knot may be read as behind the head, hidden by the frame itself, or else untied). It is their presence on the Chalcatzingo Vase that most clearly suggests the case for continuity of form and meaning in an iconographie component across a span of hundreds of miles and hundreds of years, and across language family boundaries. Three knotted ribbons are a prime symbol for bloodletting in Classic and Postclassic Maya iconography. Oddly, although the Princeton Plate is brimming with bloodletting symbolism, tri-knot elements appear to be absent from its iconographie inventory. The knotted ribbons of the Chalcatzingo Vase are supplanted on the Princeton Plate by the triad of bloodletter representations, which seem to have no structural analogue and no other homologue on the Chalcatzingo Vase besides the three knotted ribbons. Bloodletter Triad. The triad of bloodletting implements emerging from the Maize God's nose ornament, although having no direct structural analogue on the Chalcatzingo Vase, participates in another level of iconographie generalization and replication: its three elements from bottom to middle to top correspond to the three images 9. The Y elements on the Chalcatzingo Vase simultaneously repre senting both maize kernels and house posts well illustrates the multiple values commonly reflected in a single visual symbol in Mesoamerican iconography (cf. Stross, 1990).</page><page sequence="13">94 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 on the Chalcatzingo Vase from right to top to left, and of course to the glyphs on the Princeton Plate corresponding to these images (fig. 10). Specifically, the Chalcatzingo Vase's knuckle-duster on the right is a counterpart of the Akbal-infixed Pseudo Inverted Fist of the Princeton Plate (the bottom bloodletter). The central stingray spine of the Princeton Plate corresponds to Chalcatzingo Vase's top element group, not precisely in form, but positionally and conceptually.10 The eccentric flint bloodletter of the Princeton Plate has the same upward-curving shape as the torch element group on the left side of the Chalcatzingo Vase; conceptually, the Mixe word hAn tsaa "flint" (literally "fire stone") aptly encompasses the semantic range of both the flint and the torch (Mixe descends from the language of the Olmecs). A Wan cross, designating blood symbolism (Schele and Miller 1986:195), touches the tip of the flint next to three dotted circlets on the Princeton Plate;11 it can be considered a part of the flint bloodletter in the same way that the three teardrop shaped elements at the end of the Chalcatzingo Vase's torch can be considered part of the torch. Similar teardrop-shaped elements representing blood drip from knives and hearts in Teotihuacan iconography; moreover, some scholars believe the Chalcatzingo Vase's torch to be a bloodletter (Grove 1987). Table 3 systematically catalogs structural correspondences involving the bloodletter triad. III. The Quadripartite Badge The Princeton Plate's bloodletter triad together with a Kin bowl resting on the head of a zoomorph appears to embody a variant conceptual replication of the Classic Maya Quadripartite Badge (cf. Schele 1976), a symbol complex that is primally found on the rear head of the Maya Celestial Monster. Robertson saw the image as a badge of rulership (1974). Schele elaborated on this theme with respect to the meaning of the Quadripartite Badge stressing the three realms of the cosmos: "Taken as a whole, the badge presents symbols involving the Underworld, the Heavens, and ... the Middle World. The god who is identified by this badge must participate in all three levels" (Schele 1976:18). Triad As noted above, the Quadripartite Badge can be identified by a triad of motifs surmounting a Kin bowl that rests on top of the head of a zoomorph (or quadripartite monster). The triad consists of the following: /. A cross section of a shell, sometimes resembling that of a thorny oyster (Spondylus), at other times more like that of a conch. The outer edge is often scalloped; the outer section usually has three circlets. The shell is usually located to the left of the central "stingray spine," and is said to be indicative of the underworld (Schele 1976:18), which in Maya iconography frequently has shells. Shells are also likely, as in Aztec iconography, to be a sign of water and/or the ocean, the primordial substance. This element of the triad corresponds to the Akbal infixed obsidian bloodletter on the bloodletting trio on the Princeton Plate. 2. A three-part element with crossed bands and trifoliate outer segment. Sometimes three circlets are present in the middle of this component. The crossed bands motif is "a sign which is generally accepted as a symbol of the heavens (Lounsbury suggests that it is the zenith of the sun crossing the Milky Way)" (Schele 1976: 18). The Venus glyph can apparently substitute for the crossed bands on the Quadripartite Badge, as in House E at Palenque (Robertson 1985); the Cimi (death) glyph can also replace the crossed bands. 10. The suggestion of a conceptual correspondence is based on an argument relating maize symbolism to both, and to the Princeton Plate's top glyph collocation. The centrally located leaflike glyphic element of this glyph collocation, possibly representing a maize leaf, resembles a semifrontal view of the stingray spine bloodletter that is also part of the Quadripartite Badge, such as is exemplified in House E of the Palace at Palenque (fig. 5b). The central "stingray spine" symbolizes jade, which in turn symbolizes maize (Thompson 1970: 284), recalling the fact that Yucatec tun "precious stone, jade" also means "maize (leaves)." In this connection a Late Preclassic figurine from El Sitio exhibits the positioning and shape of the "stingray spine" bloodletter on an individual's head, but the "spine," an unmistakable maize ear flanked by leaves, is centrally positioned on the individual's head. As such it also coincides in position with the top element complex of the Chalcatzingo Vase, which has a brush of hairs (possible corn silk) and crossed bands flanked by triple horizontal pendants (perhaps maize kernels on a cob), recalling the Tzotzil reference to maize as "the sun's rays," and the Mesoamerican myth of the sun's conversion into maize (Pazstory 1983: 57). 11. Vincent Sassi has brought to my attention the fact that on Tikal Altar 5, the flint trident "bloodletter" has a Wan cross on its blade near the tip suggesting that it may represent blood. Taube (1985:176) notes an association between depictions on plates of severed or disembodied heads and Wan crosses, which also relate the Wan cross to blood. A Wan cross is in front of the nose of the bottom head of a two-headed Tlaloc masked "vision serpent" on Stela 24 at Yaxchilan, apparently representing blood. Outside the Maya realm, blood-red Wan crosses decorate the brim of a Huichol shaman's hat, and these must represent the bloody central quatrefoil portal linking this world to the other. Although on the Princeton plate the Wan cross is right in front of the flint, a Wan cross on the Humboldt Celt (fig. 7) is located just below the crossed bands. The Wan cross is essentially central to the piece: it appears to be replacing the disembodied head of the Chalcatzingo Vase itself. This makes sense when we remember that blood opens the portal linking the different worlds of the cosmos; that it dissolves the boundary between worlds.</page><page sequence="14">Stross: Maize and blood 95 TABLE 3. TRIAD OF BLOODLETTERS ON PRINCETON PLATE Eccentric flint bloodletter Princeton Plate Chalcatzingo Vase Stingray spine bloodletter Princeton Plate Chalcatzingo Vase Eccentric shape, flint because of Cauac markings. Curved and pointing upward. Tip has three dotted circlets. Counterpart in Quadripartite Badge usually has crossed bands. Shape of bent finger; three dotted circlets at tip, where nails should be (fingernails of Choi lak mam "lightning deity" are of flint; long variety of maize originated from fingernails of Aztec maize deity Centeotl [Nicholson 1971: 401 ]) (fig. 10a) Torch element grouping on the left, facing the disembodied head. Basic form is curved and pointing upward. Tip of it has three teardrop-shaped "maize" pendants projecting from it (fig. 10a) Central parallel lined element here called a stingray spine. Relationship between maize ear and stingray spine is suggested by (1) a green jade lancet, carved and incised to resemble the stingray spine bloodletter (Schele and Miller 1986:197), (2) maize symbolism of jade (and blood), (3) Maya etymological equation of green stone (jade) and maize (leaf), and (4) top central position of the stingray spine bloodletter both here (fig. 10b) and in the Quadripartite Badge is same position as obvious maize on El Sitio Celt Top central element with its parallel lined "brush" with the maize symbol in it, and its triple horizontal parallel pendant "wings" (maize kernels) flanking the crossed bands.

Shells, with their sharp points, used as bloodletters; found in caches with other bloodletting instruments (fig. 10c) Scalloping is on rear edge of "knuckle-duster," a conch shell, possible bloodletter (fig. 10c); this element replicated on Chalcatzingo Vase in the knuckle-duster and in markings on hand (fig. 10c) Figure 4 illustrates two variants of what may well represent earlier forms of this three-part element. It clearly shows a vegetation component that fits well with inferences that the crossed bands (of the Chalcatzingo Vase at least) may allude to maize both directly and by representing the sun. 3. A central element vertically positioned. This element?currently viewed as a stingray spine (bloodletter)?may point either up or down. In the past it has been identified as a leaf (which it greatly resembles), or a thorn, or a feather. Schele accepts the stingray spine identification and proposes to reconcile this with other identifications by arguing that linguistic evidence links the feather with the thorn (Yucatec Wiix "thorn," Quiche kiix "feather"), and leaf with ancestry (Yucatec le "leaf," Quiche /e "generation") (1976:12). Figure 17 shows Gl of the Palenque Triad with the entire Quadripartite Badge as a headdress. More frequently, however, he is shown only with elements, sometimes distorted in character, of the triadic upper portion of the Quadripartite Badge. In such cases we usually find the "oyster shell earflare" and the element with crossed bands in it. Between these elements there are two things: tied-up hair (recalling corn silk) and a (stylized) maize ear?as seen, for example, on the Metropolitan Vase (fig. 18), or on the Palenque Creation Tablet in which the headdress of Gl in zoomorphic aspect supports a naturalistically represented maize ear (fig. 19). Similar elements are identifiable also when Gl is being impersonated by a Maya lord, as on a Dumbarton Oaks Relief Panel from Palenque (fig. 20). Kin bowl The Kin (sun) glyph in bowl is usually found centered below the triad of elements just mentioned. The bowl may have a lid, perhaps some sort of a plate. The Kin symbol may be infixed with a quincunx, square-nosed dragon, or related element, or (rarely) it may be replaced entirely by a U bracket or by a hand. The Kin bowl rests on the eye of a zoomorph. It is in this position that we find other zoomorphs balancing a plant (cf. world tree with three</page><page sequence="15">96 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 Figure 17.

Drawing: Andrea Stone. circlets, figs. 4, 8) or a maize ear (Yaxchilan Lintel 15). The zoomorph on the Princeton Plate is Bolon Mayel. Zoomorph: Bolon Mayel Another facet of the relationship between maize and bloodletting can be seen in the zoomorphic deity known as Bolon Mayel (cf. Schele 1986: 52-53, 61). Bolon Mayel "appears only in glyphic or emblematic form" (Schele and Miller 1986: 52) and can be identified by the presence of the number nine in bar-and-dot form and a Figure 19. Palenque Creation Tablet. Detail, (a) Crossed bands element, (b) maize ear, (c) shell earflare. (From Stone 1983, fig. 81.) Drawing : Andrea Stone. rare glyph designating the number twenty (Schele and Miller 1986: 52). Bolon Mayel and a deity known as Uc Ek-Kan who is usually paired with him occur "most often as objects or emblems in scenes on stone stelae; in Early Classic examples, however, one or the other can be held as an object by a ruler. Although their meaning is not yet understood, their most important usage is on top of lip-to lip cache vessels" (Schele and Miller 1986: 52). Such subfloor cache vessels are not found with burials; they probably pertain to building dedication rituals. Figure 21 illustrates two examples of the Bolon Mayel emblem. Its structurally separate components include clockwise from top: (a) a rare glyph for "twenty" resembling a smiling ahau glyph with a curl at ear level on each side, and twin sprouts (perhaps of maize) with surrounding "blood dots" emerging from a cleft crown; (b) an ear of maize with husk partly stripped away; (c) a three-part ear plug assemblage; (d) a characteristically shaped protuberance next to the nostrils resembling a deer's ear; and (e) the number nine in typical Maya bar and dot notation.12 12.

Figure 22 compares the Bolon Mayel emblem components with similar components found on the Princeton Plate. Notable are the following: (1) the maize sprouts on the top portion of the component labeled b on the Bolon Mayel emerge from a maize kernel (the Kan glyph) on the Princeton Plate; (2) the rare glyph for "twenty," clearly separable from the face of the Bolon Mayel zoomorphic monster, is below rather than above this zoomorph on the Princeton Plate and forms the lower jaw portion of it; (3) the "deer's ear" protuberance just to the left of the nostrils of the zoomorph on the Bolon Mayel emblem and on the Princeton Plate is duplicated separately on the Princeton Plate (immediately above the disembodied head), as a nose ornament on a being that also has the large eye and thumblike snout of the Bolon Mayel zoomorph supporting the Kin bowl, but that lacks both the rare glyph for "twenty" and the "nine" component of that zoomorph; (5) the dots surrounding the Princeton Plate that have been identified as blood droplets by Schele and Miller (1986: 195) are found also on the Bolon Mayel emblem. This analysis of Bolon Mayel, whose counterparts on the Chalcatzingo Vase are the knuckle-duster to the right and the terrestrial panel below, suggests an intimate association of this underworld deity both with blood and with maize?an association that reverberates in cosmology where blood and maize are symbolic equivalents in certain contexts. Bolon Mayel is also seen here to be associated with the Maize God who is conceptually linked with the sun in Maya tradition and iconography.13 These themes are explored below as preface to a more general consideration of Mesoamerican cosmology related to the Chalcatzingo Vase and Princeton Plate. for the sky are known to be important for both the Classic Maya and Mayans today. The Princeton Plate has one number on it clearly intended to be such: the number nine, attached to the Bolon Mayel zoomorph. Although the Chalcatzingo Vase has no numbers that are clearly intended to be such, it shares three circlets on top (with the Princeton Plate), and it also has three circlets on the "mouth mask," three scallops and three "thatch" layers at the back of the head, and triple-pendant motifs, in addition to the triple-knot motif that helps establish this as a bloodletting bowl. Five sticks make up the torch on the left (shared with the Princeton Plate). Finally, there are the seven scallops on the knuckle-duster to the right of the vertical axis. There are, then, two numbers that could be said to be shared by both vessels in similar positions, three (various places) and five (left side). It appears that the number three is very important in Maya and in Olmec iconography, symbolizing both blood and maize, possibly derived from an underlying meaning of "soul," "spirit," or "life force" as with contemporary Tzotzil Mayans (Guiteras-Holmes 1961: 296). The number five could symbolize the cosmos with its center from which radiate the four directions. It occurs on the left side of both the Chalcatzingo Vase and the Princeton Plate, and may relate specifically to that direction. There is also some evidence?in addition to Girard's assertion that the Maya Maize God and Solar God are numeral gods whose number is five (1979:1 74)?that the number five can be connected with maize, both for Mayans and for Olmecs (Stross 1985: 17-19), including the fact that among Tzotzil Mayans, five ears of maize are used in curing and five kernels of maize per hole for sowing (Guiteras-Holmes 1961: 218). 13.

Other Yucatec deity names with "nine" in them, where their meanings are analyzable in Yucatec, would be fitting epithets for a single deity related to divination and fertility (and thus to blood). One of these, Nine Stick leg, calls to mind the "digging stick," or coa, with which maize is planted, the word coa likely deriving from N?huatl coati, or "snake." God K in his Classic Maya manifestation is sometimes shown with one leg held like a stick, and terminating in a serpent. Kowalski (1983) has argued that God K is a deity of agricultural abundance and fertility (as well as of lightning). God K also has a strong association with smoking and tobacco for the Classic Maya, relating perhaps to the fact that may in many Mayan languages is "tobacco." God K (always shown zoomorphically) in his classic manifestation as the bloodletting deity whose glyph, like that of Bolon Mayel, is prefixed by a nine, and as the earthly arbiter of lineage (thus related to the ancestors residing in the underworld) could have a zoomorphic companion relating both to maize/blood and to the serpent (recall the T114 [Chicchan] "nostrils" of Bolon Mayel, and the serpent foot of Classic God K), and could be the deity responsible for the transformation of blood and water into maize.</page><page sequence="18">Stross: Maize and blood 99 IV. The disembodied head, maize, blood, and the sun It is clear that the disembodied head on the Princeton Plate is the Maya Maize God himself (corresponding to the Aztec Maize deity Centeotl, whose birth day, 1 Flower, is the same as that of both the Maya Gl's father and Gil of Palenque, and the Aztec equivalent to the name "Hunahpu"). The maize symbolism of his headdress is too explicit for any other conclusion. The youthful face of this deity, with its attendant markings (except that it lacks an "oyster shell ear"), recalls the physical appearance of Gl, a god first identified and named at Palenque but found through much of the Classic Maya region. A possible Colonial Period Mayan homologue for Gl of the Classic Maya is Hunahpu of the Popol Vuh, assumed by many to have been the "Hero Twin" who became the sun or, by some interpretations, Venus (cf. Schele and Miller 1986: 48). Taube, in a valuable reconsideration of the Classic Maya Maize Deity in Maya iconography, identified the disembodied heads as maize deities symbolizing a link between the harvest and Maya kingship and aesthetics: "The foliated severed heads clearly symbolize the cob [i.e., the ear of maize] cut from the stalk. It is probable that the disembodied, tonsured head also represents the harvested maize" (1985:171 ).14 Taube also suggested that the elongated heads of Maya nobility?artificially induced in real life, and clearly depicted in art?may represent (or emulate in form and perhaps meaning) the maize ear, and proposed that the well-known and highly important Maya bloodletting implement resembles, and in some sense may represent, a maize husking tool (Taube 1985: 180). The Maize God, linked to Maya bloodletting ritual and kingship, dies with each harvest and is reborn with each sowing. "The quintessential Classic Maya expression of the intimate relationship between kingship, maize, and the ritual act of bloodletting is found on the tablet from the Temple of the Foliated Cross at Palenque" (Fields 1989: 41), the iconography of which has been interpreted to represent the birth of humans from maize (Schele 1976: 24). Not only is maize then "the most basic and most sacred of all .. . Mayan foods" (Gossen 1972:143); it is the substance from which humans were fashioned (according to Mayan accounts) by mixture with the blood of a god or gods. Other features in the Maya iconography of disembodied heads, noted by Taube (1985), are especially relevant to the bloodletting iconography of the Chalcatzingo Vase and the Princeton Plate: 1. their frequent association with a necklace (perhaps representing maize kernels); 2. their association with a bell-shaped nose ornament (perhaps representing a maize kernel in the present context); 3. their association with the Wan cross (representing blood, maize, or both); 4. their association with blood, and the symbolic equation of blood with seed and lineage. Necklace The necklace association with the disembodied heads (Taube 1985:171) is of considerable interest here. Although the Princeton Plate displays a mirror in the necklace position, considering the Tzotzil ritual term for maize foods (xohobal), meaning "radiance" or "halo of the sun," and the cosmological relationship between the sun and the mirror (Carlson 1981 ), it seems that the Princeton Plate's mirror represents not only the sun but a maize metaphor as well. A sun reference does not exclude a maize reference for the same symbol, one reason being that an attested Tzotzil belief derives maize from the sun's groin (Gossen 1972).15 Moreover, multiple visual referents for the same icon is a practice well documented in Mesoamerica as early as Formative times (Stross 1990). The necklace found on other Maize God images is thus by implication also a string of maize kernels around the neck.16 14. Digby echoes a similar sentiment concerning the Classic Maya maize deity, but for a different reason. Noting that the crossed bands on the pendant of the Maize God and the skull pendant on the bust of the Maize God are in complementary distribution, and remarking on the presence of crossed bands (and bones) on the "completion" glyph, he suggests an association of crossed bands with death, suggesting that "the youthful maize god of the Maya may well carry the signs of death to symbolize the idea of the cutting of the maize, and of rejuvenation with the young seed. The idea is the same as that found in the worship of Attis and Adonis in the Old World" (1972: 26). 15. Note that the Aztec deity Piltzintecuhtli, a youthful manifestation of the sun god Tonatiuh and equivalent to the Maya lord of the number seven according to Klein (1977:174), fathered Centeotl, the Maize God. 16. Some insight into the meaning of the necklace may proceed from an Aztec metaphor by which a baby is referred to as the "precious necklace" (Berdan 1982: 82). A small monument from another part of Mesoamerica?Zaachila in the Valley of Oaxaca?contains what has been interpreted as a genealogical register (Marcus 1980), an upper panel of which is said to record a royal couple's marriage. A deity is evidently emerging downward through the "jaws of the sky," holding out a string of beads (a necklace) to what are evidently supplicants. A "baby" or "birth" interpretation for the necklace is possible here also. The "birth" symbolism of the necklace might refer in Maya iconography to maize kernels being sown and thus reborn as plants, which are in turn responsible for the birth and development of humankind. A necklace of maize kernels reborn to provide life and</page><page sequence="19">100 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 As noted above, the Chalcatzingo Vase has crossed bands, instead of a mirror, where the Maize God necklace might otherwise be. The crossed bands are flanked by a double row of triple pendants, possibly representing maize kernels. The pendants are line darkened in their centers. Similar lined centers occur occasionally on Maya representations of maize kernels (e.g., Ch?nes capstone from Nucbec, after Taube 1985:177, figs. 6b, 6c). Nose ornament "Terming it the Disembodied head, Coe (1978: 83) notes that the Classic entity usually has a necklace at the base of the neck and a bell-shaped nose ornament" (Taube 1985:177). The Princeton Plate's disembodied head has a bell-shaped nose ornament, whose three components?a darkened outer part, a main interior, and a central outlined interior?suggest a maize kernel. Because it is the maize /cerne/that in contemporary times represents the spirit of maize,17 and because the human spirit or life principle is seen by Mayans to be in the breath, prototypically related to the nose, it is thus quite appropriate for a maize kernel to be in front of the nose (cf. Guiteras-Holmes 1961: 301). Noting that maize and blood are somehow symbolically interchangeable, and that the blood is also a locus of the human spirit (and indicator of health) for the Mayans of today (cf. Guiteras Holmes 1961: 212), it is also appropriate that the Pedrano Tzotzil Maize mother, "soul of our sustenance" (x?ob) and daughter of the Lightning Deity (Guiteras-Holmes 1961 : 291) is recognized by the blood seen on her nose (Guiteras-Holmes 1961:218). Kfan cross Taube suggests that the Wan cross, frequently associated with maize and with bloodletters, refers to maize (1985: 180) (cf. no. 11 ), but the association between maize and blood for the Maya, minimally as precious elements, is actually much more fundamental and pervasive: the Wan cross has the shape of a quatrefoil, a design element well known to Mesoamericanists as a representation in plan of the portal separating this world from the otherworld, a representation alternatively depicted in elevation as the great mouth or maw of the earth monster?it is glyphically represented at Yaxchilan for example as the "black hole." Sacrificial blood opens this portal. According to Mesoamerican lore, maize once issued from the portal when the Lightning Deity created the portal/cleft in "sustenance mountain." Each year since, maize springs forth anew from a hole ("portal") in the ground where it was planted by humans. Maize, blood, and the Wan cross are thus inextricably bound together. The Wan cross as found on the Princeton Plate is completely consistent with both maize and blood symbolic interpretations. Blood, maize kernels, and lineage Seeds, also including beans and other types, but particularly maize kernels, have an integral association with blood for the Maya: the soul or spirit resides in both and blood of course implies descent and lineage, among the most important considerations in kingship (cf. Stuart 1984). It is not surprising then to find bloodletting and agriculture symbolically and perhaps irrevocably linked for the Maya, as is formally quite evident on the Princeton Plate. Evidence for the maize seed/blood linkage is both iconographie and ethnographic. For example, the Madrid Codex (at 35b) presents a disembodied head of God E (the Maize lord) surrounded by a red pool of blood, depicted as lined up UUU's (T136), which by their shape are likely also to represent kernels of maize. Taube cites several ethnographic examples supporting his contention that among Mayans maize is commonly identified with blood. Most of these examples prominently feature birth, as in the Chenalho Tzotzil use of a corn ear bloodied from the cutting of a newborn child's umbilical cord to seed a special maize field called the "child's blood" (1985:178; Thompson 1970: 283); or rebirth, as when the Chorti refer to maize as the blood of Jesus Christ (Taube 1985:180). Taube suspects that for the Classic Maya "blood was considered as dynastic seed, the vital material which linked the generations of the living and the dead" (1985:180). In sum, we can see the disembodied head of the Maize God, related to the sun and to kingship, as the center and focus of the iconographie images compared and discussed on the Chalcatzingo Vase and Princeton Plate. Iconographie elements symbolizing blood and maize as a sustenance to man might easily be seen to symbolically represent birth (or rebirth). Analogously, a necklace is transferred from the outgoing officeholder to the incoming one on the New Year's day change-of-office ceremony among the Tzeltal and Tzotzil Mayans, and among these same Mayans the grandchild is called the "replacement" (helol) of the grand parents because the soul of the latter is reincarnated in the former. 17. Petrich reports that for the Mocho and the Tzeltal Mayans at least, the vital center or "spirit" of maize is located in the kernels, as they represent the divinity sacrificed and buried by men. "Each kernel is the Maize lord, reborn in order to give sustenance and life to man" (1985:138).</page><page sequence="20">Stross: Maize and blood 101 receptacle for cosmic essence have been isolated; these include the Maize God's necklace and nose ornament, as well as the Wan cross, Y elements, and circlets. These elements in fact are among the primary cosmological symbols to be found on the cosmograms represented by the incised images on the two vessels. V. Cosmology and cosmograms Maize and blood symbolism do not merely coexist on the Chalcatzingo Vase and the Princeton Plate and elsewhere in Mesoamerican iconography; the two concepts are metaphorical equivalents, the one alluding to and sometimes even substituting for the other. This should come as no surprise to Mesoamericanists. The domestication of plants, particularly of maize, was of utmost significance in the lives of pre-Hispanic Mesoamericans that had previously depended in large part on hunting, and Indian societies remaining in Mesoamerica still depend to an extraordinary degree on maize as food and on maize as a cosmic metaphor. Hunting symbolism seems to have carried over into the cosmological metaphors of these agricultural peoples, and the two food-getting activities (hunting and agriculture) were viewed in some ways as figuratively synonymous. The hunting arrow could thus be equated with the digging stick; the blood and flesh of the deer with the ear of maize; and harvesting of both game and maize was accomplished in metaphorically identical terms. Maize and blood were thus conceptually united a long time ago in Mesoamerica, and they remain so today. Moreover, they remain among the most powerful essences of the Mesoamerican cosmogram. Cosmologies deal with the measurement and boundaries of matter, space, and time; with the forces of nature and the place of humans within nature; with the nature of power (divinity); and with the power to manipulate the cosmos (divination). They "explain" the sky above and the mud below, and that which separates them. Cosmograms are the iconographie manifestation of cosmologies, selecting a small number of significant symbols relating to a people's cosmology, for iconic or purely symbolic depiction. These symbols, because of their power?implicit in their imitation of the powerful forces of nature among other sources?are frequently employed to explain the cosmos and manipulated to maintain social and natural harmony.18 18. Cosmograms figure in important human rituals, themselves indi vidual or communal manifestations of the cosmological principles of a people, that are employed in order to facilitate the movement of people in In Mesoamerica, cosmograms are associated with cache offerings: integral components of bloodletting ritual, house and milpa ritual, altar ritual, bewitchment, and curing ritual. They are also associated in Mesoamerica with the power displays of rulers and other power brokers (in the costume and accompanying accoutrements depicted surrounding the individual, among other things), with architectural facades in the form of masks, and with the measurement of time and those activities coordinated by cyclic time conceptions. Cosmograms maintain the balance and harmony of the world, essentially by restating it in schematic form. In Mesoamerica the cosmogram with the ruler properly located and identified within its structural format constitutes the primary charter of rulership. The human body, its parts and their positions on the body, in addition to its stages of growth, provided an excellent cosmological model that was employed in Europe, as well as independently in Mesoamerica. Reilly has shown that Olmecs encoded the three cosmic levels (upper world, middle world, and lower world) as well as right and left symbolism into an anthropomorphic image of the Olmec ruler known as Slim (1987). Reilly has demonstrated directional symbolism at Chalcatzingo as well, referencing bloodletting on the left and vegetation on the right (1989a), which I interpret as stemming from east-west symbolism of the solar passage and associated cosmological notions of birth and death that can be generalized as creation and destruction. The fact that the Chalcatzingo Vase and the Princeton Plate are organized around a theme of a central deity constructed in the image of human body parts and surrounded by four equidistant subsidiary elements implies that mythico-cosmological conceptualizations are represented on both vessels (directly or symbolically). for change by the forces of tradition (inertia). They serve to manifest and groups or as individuals from one place to another in time, space, and/or social position (e.g., in birth ceremonies, pilgrimages, death rituals). They function also to bind people together as the components of the cosmos are bound together, if not in permanent harmony, then at least in some form of dynamic equilibrium (marriage ceremonies), balancing the forces to propagate ideology. Cosmograms also figure in the process of vitalizing or animating projects initiated by humans that have the potential for upsetting the harmony of nature (e.g., the construction of houses and temples). They figure in the demarcation of boundaries, whether these be the boundaries of stages in the life cycles of natural phenomena (including humans), or boundaries in space (the milpa, measured out so carefully with the digging stick/spear and the four directions), or the boundaries of time (period ending and renewal ceremonies). They figure in the replication of the world order and its creation, so important for world renewal ceremonies.</page><page sequence="21">102 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 These appear to involve at least the following: (a) the center and the four cardinal directions; (b) deities of earth, sky, east, and west and/or Moon, Sun, Venus, and Night Sun; (c) the sky being separated from the earth by a mediating maize deity with solar and bloodletting characteristics constituting some of the regal insignia of office; (d) the vital principle of maize/blood in the cosmic center balancing and mediating the cosmic components and maintaining and supporting both cosmos and microcosmic structure. A directional interpretation extrapolated to the Chalcatzingo Vase on the basis of reading the Maya glyph T539 with infixed quincunx as wayeb ("sleeping place, bed") implies that the knuckle-duster on the vessel's right side may represent the eastern day sun (rising), and the left-side torch could be the western night sun (setting). This fits in part with the recent discovery at Rio Azul of a Maya Tomb 12 where the directional glyphs (matching the real directions east, north, west, and south) are found in association with other glyphs representing "mythical cosmic association with" various entities. East/sun, North/ moon, West/night sun ("darkness," Akbal glyph), and South/Venus (Adams 1986: 442). The cosmological interpretation herein preferred for both the Chalcatzingo Vase and the Princeton Plate retains the notions of east and west, but substitutes zenith for north and nadir for south on the assumption that the central Maize God functions as the Axis MundiXo link the underworld, middle world, and upper world, and to represent the place of transformation, mediation, and balance. Two nonceramic items of similar cosmological significance can be compared to the Chalcatzingo Vase and Princeton Plate. The first item, which is perhaps even earlier in time than the Chalcatzingo Vase, is a small greenstone Olmec plaque from Guerrero, now in the Dallas Museum (fig. 15). It contains, within a quatrefoil outline (cave/mouth of crocodilian earth monster), the depiction of a miniature cosmos. At the top is pictured a sky element (crossed bands surrounded by thirteen pendants). The bottom has a terrestrial panel surmounted by a three-tiered temple/pyramid. The center has a "world tree" or "cornstalk" depiction whose branches/arms and trunk separate four seed elements clearly corresponding to the four Y elements on the Chalcatzingo Vase. Additional elements on this plaque are possible raindrop symbols within the pyramid and the terrestrial panel, and three circlets placed horizontally below the terrestrial panel. The second item, which is much later in time even than the Princeton Plate, is on page 34 of the Dresden Codex. Here in the top register a disembodied head, with maize headdress and tripartite (maize spirit) nose ornament, is placed on a Caban glyph atop a three-tiered pyramid/temple. The centrally located maize head is surrounded by four deities playing music who correspond structurally to the four Y elements on the Chalcatzingo Vase. Additional elements in the composition include a burning brazier and two animal heads apparently with Kan glyphs (maize kernels), as well as a ladder. Cosmos in a cache vessel In view of the representation of the Maize deity on the Princeton Plate, and the fact that this vessel was the top half of a lip-to-lip cache vessel deposited below floor level in a Maya temple, possibly for dedication purposes, it may be pertinent to recall the story in the Popol Vuh of the planting of a maize plant (or ear) by each of the Hero Twins in the floor of their grandmother's house?in the attic, according to Tedlock (1985). The fate of the maize was to represent the fate of the twins: Because the stalks of maize sown by the twins are their alter egos ... they will suffer an identic [sic] fate. If the twins die the stalks will die, but if they live then the stalks will sprout and grow. This explains why they were sown in dry soil and in the middle of the house-floor, for they represent the Maize god in the central point of the cosmos, here symbolized by the house, where the plants will remain as the image of the divine youths. (Girard 1979:173) Thus the maize deity on the Princeton Plate as cache vessel is buried under the floor of an architectural structure in the same way that maize is planted/buried in the house floor in the Popol Vuh. If the spirit of each planted maize stalk represents a companion spirit (Maya way, Aztec nagual) of one of the Hero Twins, in the sense that the life experience of the companion bears an allegorical relationship to the life of the twin, as Girard explains the meaning of the Popol Vuh event, then by analogy the cache vessel's Maize God is ritually placed in the cosmic "center" where it may bear a similar allegorical relationship to individuals or structures external to the center, such as the ruler for whom the building was dedicated or the animated building itself. According to Girard, Chorti Mayans would identify the Hero Twins of the Popol Vuh in terms of another sort of pairing, one of implicit complementarity along with the shared essence. In this connection the Chorti explicitly name the Maize God and the Young Sun God as "brother gods" that are alter egos of one another, recalling the maize/sun duality found on the Chalcatzingo Vase and the Princeton Plate:</page><page sequence="22">Stross: Maize and blood 103 The picturesque allegory of the Popol Vuh is explained in terms of Chorti theology by the category of brother gods (with the meaning of an alter ego) such as the Maize and young Solar god, functions that are acquired by the twins.... This intimate relationship is also expressed by a common denominator, since both the Maize god and Solar god are numeral gods whose number is five. (Girard 1979: 174) It is indeed the case that five, specifically in a quincunx pattern of a center surrounded by four equidistant peripheral positions, bears a special cosmological and cosmogonie relationship to both maize and the sun (Stross 1990), as Girard avers. The Young Maize God, however, presides over the Classic Maya number eight, rather than five, and the Young Sun God presides over the number four. The numbers four and eight, it may be noted, share a special numerical relationship to one another; they also reflect the peripheral elements of the quincunx form, thus implying the center. In Mayan maize planting, when the quincunx pattern is employed, each peripheral element of the original center becomes a center in its own right as the planting process proceeds. The center is itself a focal connective and balancing element in the Mesoamerican cosmological scheme; one that has survived until the present. The positioning of the maize sprouts in the center of the house, coinciding with the descent of the twins into the underworld, expresses another custom of the time, consisting of burial of the dead within the house.... We should mention the custom preserved by Quiche Indians of sowing two maize stalks in the middle of the plaza in front of their house, in remembrance of the stalks left behind by Hunahpu and Ixbalamque as a memento for their grandmother as they left for Xibalba. (Girard 1979: 174-175) While the center represents a cosmic portal connecting this world with the otherworld, the contemporary custom of planting two maize stalks in the house patio/plaza rather than inside the house accords with and may reflect the fact that the dead are no longer buried in the house. It also fits conceptually with the Classic Maya plaza in front of the temple as a representation of the watery underworld, a focal part of the sacred landscape reflecting a cosmological format persisting since Preclassic times (Reilly 1989b). Tedlock agrees with Girard that the planted maize in the Popol Vuh represents the twins' fate, but focuses on the "planting" of maize ears inside the house in modern times and emphasizes that the twins are demonstrating a harvest ritual that Quiches follow to this day. They "plant" ears of corn in the center of her house, in the attic; these ears are neither to be eaten nor used as seed corn but are to be kept as a sign that corn remains alive throughout the year, even between the drying out of the plants at harvest time and the sprouting of new ones after planting. (Tedlock 1985:42) The contemporary use of certain maize ears as a living sign of immortality, as Tedlock emphasizes, recalls an analogous practice, referred to in contemporary Mayan oral literature as well as attested in archaeological remains, of using sacrificial blood and victims in pre Columbian Mesoamerica to provide a "soul" or "vital spirit" for such human-made works as bridges, temples, and so on, in order to animate them, thus ensuring their successful functioning. Maize and the maize deity, symbols of sacrifice and resurrection, epitomize the immortal vital essence that would be completely appropriate for dedicating an important building, because this essence is what brings to life (animates) the human made construction in an animate natural world, all parts of which are alive in an important sense. This essence, a heart/soul/spirit, makes the building live and operate as a part of nature. Eliade helps us to understand in a broader context why the blood and head of the Maize deity might be found in the floor of a newly constructed Maya edifice. The symbolism of the center (of the world or universe or cosmos) is expressed in the notion of microcosmic replication and involves three interconnected and complementary propositions: 1. The "sacred mountain" where heaven and earth meet, stands at the centre of the world; 2. Every temple or palace, and by extension, every sacred town and royal residence, is assimilated to a "sacred mountain" and thus becomes a "centre"; 3. The temple or sacred city, in turn, as the place through which the Axis Mundi passes, is held to be a point of junction between heaven, earth, and hell. (Eliade 1958:375) It is necessary, according to Eliade, to ritually re-create the world and its central "sacred mountain" when founding or establishing a building or town, so that what is established partakes of the "center." The world re creation is accomplished by giving ritual birth to a miniature "sacred landscape" by means of filling a sacred hole with living essence and covering it with an altar/ portal and then ritually establishing a sacred boundary around the "world."</page><page sequence="23">104 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 Any new human establishment of any sort is in a sense, a reconstruction of the world. If it is to last, if it is to be real, the new dwelling or town must be projected by means of the construction ritual into the "centre of the universe." According to many traditions, the creation of the world was begun in a centre and for this reason the building of towns must also develop round a centre. Romulus dug a deep trench (fossa), filled it with fruit, covered it again with earth, and having set up an altar (ara) over it, traced a rampart round it with his plough.... The trench was a mundus ["world"]. (Eliade 1958:373)19 If the creation of the world is the prototype for all human constructions, symbolically expressed in particular detail for "sacred space," and if the center is of the ritual and symbolic importance ascribed to it by Eliade, then one might speculate that the Princeton Plate as a cache vessel was located in the sacral "center" of whatever building went up over it, that the cache projected the whole building into the center of sacred space, that the cache was placed near or after completion of such construction, and that some sort of sacred "altar" may at one time have been erected on top of it. As a centerpoint linking by means of the Axis Mundi the underworld, the middle world, and the upper world, it would represent a place of transformation, where the maize seeds and the blood and the symbolic extensions of these were unified in conception, and where these would have possessed their greatest power. An apt metaphor for the caching of such a vessel in a building would be the implantation of a "heart" (which could be excised when the building was to be symbolically killed before abandonment), as has been suggested by Annabeth Headrick (personal communication, 1989). It is likely that the Maya used this metaphor. That the Chalcatzingo Vase could have served as a cache vessel as did the Princeton Plate, providing the animating power to an Olmec temple, is suggested by the multiple iconographie similarities between these two vessels. Despite the very different shapes of the vessels and the different artistic styles employed, differences explicable by the gulf of time, space, and culture separating their manufacturers, the function of the later one can be attributed to the other. This conclusion is additionally supported by the architectonic image of the post-and-lintel shaped frame containing the disembodied head sprouting maize and surrounded by four housepole/ seeds. This architectonic image, although apparently absent on the Princeton Plate, occurs also on the Dallas Plaque and in the Dresden Codex on page 34, as well as in the Popol Vuh and even in current Quiche Maya custom. Numerous similarities in form and iconographie function between the Chalcatzingo Vase and the Princeton Plate add up to persuasive evidence that these terra-cotta vessels represent the same themes in structurally similar ways with several homologous (as well as analogous) elements. The vessel comparisons can be further used for identifying formally different elements in the same structural positions. One can deduce that either of two possibilities has occurred: (1) a given element has changed in form through the years, the one later in time having developed from the earlier either by depicting essentially the same thing in a somewhat different way while serving the same functions, or (2) the given element developed different functions in the course of time, serving different ends, and therefore requiring different formal manifestations. Sometimes, of course, iconographie homologues change positions, being identifiable as such only by formal resemblances. To the extent that the proposed homologous forms are in fact so, it is possible to point to specific Maya glyphs, referenced by T number (Thompson 1962), and to show what forms they reflect from the iconography (and glyphs) on the Princeton Plate. One may then suggest what they may reflect of earlier forms from a different culture?that of the Olmecs, which through their Late Formative descendants strongly influenced the symbol system of the Maya. The appendix performs this task in tabular form. 19. The founding of Rome is only one illustration of this world creation process and founding of the center. Eliade provides another variant in discussing the foundations of Christianity. To Christians, Golgotha was the centre of the world; it was both the topmost point of the cosmic mountain and the spot where Adam was created and buried. The Savior's blood was therefore sprinkled over Adam's skull buried at the very foot of the cross, and thus redeemed him.
