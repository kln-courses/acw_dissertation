<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNPACKING POLLOCK'S MALE AND FEMALE: ART PERSONA, HERMAPHRODITE, ANIMA, AND INDIVIDUATION Lucy Bowditch in Jungian terms, Jackson Pollock s persona has been defined by stereotypical male be havior—heavy drinking and raucous swag ger. 1 Reflecting this attitude, art criticism of the time was marked by terms celebrating artists' aggressive action, strength, muscu larity, boldness, and impenetrability.2 Pol lock's alleged public urination in Peggy Guggenheim's fireplace is dramatized in Ed Harris's movie Pollock (2000). And it is well known that the artist's final drunken binge culminated in a violent car crash. Historically, the persona of the artist spills over into how we interpret his painting.3 Instead, however, I would like to propose looking at the "behavior" of the painting. What art persona does a particular piece suggest? In Jungian terms, persona applies to the way Pollock shows himself to the world. I am adding a twist: How does the work itself present to the world? My term art persona corresponds loosely to the idea of an author's "voice." Pollock is best known for his innovative allover drip—or, more accurately, poured— paintings from the late 1940s and early 1950s. But of equal, if not greater, sig nificance in terms of symbolic interpretation and psychological development are works that he made during and just following his Jungian analysis, particularly his Male and Female (c. 1942).4 The forms, many of which may be associated with Jungian ideas, resist resolution; yet, in the failure of formal resolution, we may find the paradoxical success of the work. The human-scaled canvas, loosely com posed as a series of vertical rectangles, is largely occupied by multifaceted, abstract, ambiguous, yet anthropomorphic forms set in a dominantly blue ground with intermittent dynamic, abstract, whitish mark-making. In Male and Female, abstraction and figuration wrestle. Two sets of feet can be seen in the lower register. And, in vertical alignment with the two sets of feet, one sees heads. The shapes in the painting—specifically the half, full, and crescent moons—bring to mind Jungian ideas; the moon is associated with the dark side, the shadow, the uncon scious.5 References to moon shapes may be seen in both heads. The one on the left contains a dark half moon. And the other could be seen as both a full moon with a shadow across one side or, if one looks to the far right, a crescent moon. Equally germane are the suggestions of male and female forms. Scholars agree that there are indications of both, but there is no consensus about which forms are female and which are male. For example, the undulating terra-cotta figure on the left may be seen either as a female with an embryonic form in the belly or as a male with a flaccid phallus. Jungian scholar Elizabeth Langhorne offered a detailed analysis of the work based on Jungian symbolism. It was later rejected as too literal by curator and art historian William Rubin, who considered the painting an image of sexual encounter and sexual uncertainty.6 Much lively discussion may be generated regarding specific forms suggested in Male</page><page sequence="2">66 Fig. 1 Jackson Pollock, Male and Female, c. 1942.

O'Connor mentioned the dog form in the lower half of the painting whose head is seen pressing up against the black rectangle with numbers.7 And, in turn, the numbers may be interpreted in terms of Pollock's New York address. I, however, am not interested in the specific designation of forms or numbers, but in the fact of ambiguity supported by the lack of consensus pertaining to the basic male and female designations. From a strict formalist viewpoint the poured paintings, where we no longer see conflict or a binary composition, are a culmination, an epiphany, but psychologically, some argue, a denouement.10 The delicious moment of ten sion is gone. The debatable combinations invite con siderations of the Jungian archetypal herm aphrodite. Jung's description of the herm aphrodite is consistent with Pollock's artistic struggle and personal crisis, which, one could argue, brought him to Jungian analysis and also drove him away from it. Jung states: The primordial idea (hermaphrodite) has become a symbol of creative union of opposites, a "uniting symbol" in the literal sense. In its functional significance the symbol no longer points back, but forward to a goal not yet reached. Not withstanding its monstrosity, the herm aphrodite has gradually turned into a subduer of conflicts and a bringer of healing.8 As civilization develops, the bisexual primordial being turns into a symbol of the unity of personality, a symbol of the self, where the war of opposites finds peace. In this way the primordial being becomes the distant goal of man's self development, having been from the very beginning a projection of his uncon scious wholeness.9 According to Jung, the hermaphrodite be comes the subduer of conflict. But conflict is not subdued in Male and Female. The paint ing shows ambiguity regarding opposites. How else might we interpret the uncer tainty in the sexual designation of the forms placed before us? Could the painting be seen as Pollock's subjective understanding of Carl and Emma Jung's concept of anima? The term has been summarized by George H. Jensen as "the female Other within a male."11 Discussion of the concept in Carl Jung's own work is extensive.12 The references are slip pery and poetic, not scientific. They are deep ly qualified by the gender biases of Jung's generation.13 In more recent literature, one finds feminist revisions of the anachronistic notions of the "inferior" female-identified un conscious soul within the conscious male.14 There is collateral evidence and a high likelihood that anima, an unstable concept in itself, is critical to understanding the painting. If the painting was made in 1942, the artist was in Jungian analysis with Dr. Violet Staub de Laszlo.15 Pollock and his peers—for example, Mark Rothko—were obsessed with transcendent, mysterious, hidden symbols in the late 1930s and early 1940s.16 It is highly probable that Pollock's search for his own artistic "voice," which would include breaking from the powerful influence of Picasso, would have been part of his therapy. It is also reasonable to speculate that the question of the unconscious would have been a topic of conversation at the Cedar Tavern, where the New York school artists regularly gathered. When Pollock was asked "Do you find it important that many Euro pean artists are living in this country?" he responded, "I am particularly impressed with their concept of the source of art being the</page><page sequence="4">68 unconscious."17 He also stated, "I am na ture."18 The declaration suggests a desire to be seen as existing in a state close to the unconscious. There is no evidence that Pollock had read Jung's work. But substantial evidence does exist that Pollock was acutely interested in Jung's ideas; there is a list of articles about Jung in Pollock's handwriting.19 John Gra ham probably brought Jung to Pollock's attention.20 Scholars generally agree that the artist would have encountered Jungian notions of anima in analysis or through friends rather than by actually reading Jung's work.21 An additional personal factor is relevant to interpreting the painting. In August 1943, Lee Krasner moved into Pollock's apartment at 46 East Eighth Street. A year later they were married.22 The painting may thus be related to an early phase in Pollock's rela tionship to Krasner. Pollock may be grap pling with himself and Krasner, not only as sexual creatures but also as individuated artists, each a union of male and female, and capable of artistic creation. We might see the imagery as showing two figures each with a developed creative unconscious or anima. Again, the interpretation accommodates the particularly unstable male element in the painting—that is, the fact that Pollock has not clearly designated a male figure—and it also accounts for the doubling.23 Another significant Jungian concept that may be brought to bear on Male and Female is individuation. While even Jung's defini tions of the concept vary, generally it suggests a person becoming whole or achieving a balance between the outer, conscious self and the inner, unconscious self.24 And, I would add, as axiomatic to my interpretation of Pollock's Male and Female, any creative artist embodies, as Freud also said, male and female qualities. Paradoxically, the notion of an individuated person, one in touch with the shadow, the soul, the inner and usually unexpressed side—indeed, the anima—may be part of the art persona, or mask of a creator in his (or her) work. Such an interpretation may seem oxy moronic; discrete categories—in this case, psychological constructs—are combined in a contradictory or incongruous manner. Jung states that the anima is the persona's counter part.25 But might Pollock want his art persona to be his anima, proof of his status as an artist? Perhaps the artist wishes to be seen as one who actively wrestles with, and comes to terms with, his creative unconscious, his anima. Then what we are seeing is a con structed identity—what 1 call an art persona. The painting, seen as a self-conscious image of the creative unconscious, is akin to wearing a mask of one's own face to a costume party: it simultaneously designates you and does not. In Male and Female, the opposition between abstraction and figura tion, male and female, the obvious and the obscured is visible. The impossibility of full resolution is a profound indication of being alive as Pollock surely was in the early 1940s, when he was straggling to find his own style and technique, when his personal life ap peared to be stabilizing and his artistic life held the promise of self-development and wholeness.</page><page sequence="5">69 NOTES 1.
