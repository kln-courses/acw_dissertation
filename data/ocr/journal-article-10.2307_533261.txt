IN prehistoric times a semi-migratory, agricultural band of Indians, the majority of whose members belonged to a clan which regarded Snake beings as their totem, began the erection of stone habitations among the foothills of the East Mesa of Tusayan in northeastern Ari- zona. The village they built was the beginning of a pueblo which was later moved to the summit of the mesa and called Walpi, "the place of the gap." Several families with other totems, one after another, joined the original founders of Walpi, and the population of the an- cient pueblo increased in size. Increments came from all directions, especially from the south and east, the former forced from their homes by inroads of the hostile Apaches, the latter by the Spanish invaders. These colonists arrived in clans, and on their reception at Walpi were assigned certain building sites adjoining houses already erected, and as a result the combined habitations enlarged the pueblo in such a way that different sections of it were inhabited by different clans, a localization which can still be detected. It would seem that each of these incoming families possessed a clan totemism more or less distinctive, and, long after each was united with the others retained ceremonies distinctive of that wor- ship without molestation. There was no spirit of interference of one with another; for each family was allowed to worship as it liked, and no one thought of forcing its rites on its neighbors. For some time these separate family rites were retained in the clans which introduced them, but as the people, by intermarriage, became more homogeneous, religious societies developed and outgrew the boundaries of families, to which in early times they were limited. This is, in brief, the growth of the Hopi people and their ritual, as recounted in their legends. It is instructive to examine the evidences other than legendary that new cults, characteristic of alien clans, have been added to that originally existing at Walpi, and the nature of this evidence can best be illustrated by a study of one of the prominent additions in com- paratively modern times.</page><page sequence="3">yournal of American Folk-Lore. By a common use of the word, the term Katcinal (Cachena) is often applied to all public ceremonials or dances among Pueblo Indians. This universal application of the term is not warranted in speaking of the Hopi religious festivals, since this people have many observances which have nothing to do with the Katcinas. The majority of the ceremonials from August to December do not belong to this group, but bear evidences of greater age, and the natural conclusion is, that at one time in the growth of the ritual there were no Katcinas. The aspect of the subject we are about considering is the evidence, other than legendary, that the Katcina cultus is extra Tusayan in origin, and was not a part of the original Hopi ritual, but was added to it in comparatively modern times by colonists from pueblos of other stocks.2 Documentary evidences bearing on the growth of the Hopi rit- ual are insufficient to aid us in our study. We have no complete account of a Hopi Katcina or other ceremony in any description by Spanish or American writers up to the middle of the present century, and it is only in the last two decades that any serious study of this subject has been attempted. Had some Catholic priest, in the six- teenth century, described the Hopi worship in the same detail that Sahagun, Serna, and others did, the aboriginal religions of Mexico, from a comparison with the known modern ceremonies of Walpi, we would be able to determine the new elements which have been added to it, and thus trace the growth of the ritual. Two other classes of evidence of its character may be adduced; viz., that drawn from archaeology and linguistics. Palaeography or predocu- mentary3 evidences affords important contributions to a know- ledge of this subject. The designs on old pottery often represent, pictorially, an elaborate religious symbolism, and archaeology has brought to light an almost limitless amount of this material. An interpretation of these pictures from ruins of different ages reveals in a way the growth of religious ideas, and from a comparison of the 1 The word Katcina is used to designate (i) a divinized ancestor; (2) a dance in which these beings are personated by masked men; (3) a picture or graven image of the same. 2 The present Hopi ritual, like the people themselves, is a composite of compo- sites, and this article deals with primary rather than secondary analyses. The custom of referring to the Hopi as a primitive people is misleading, and the error involved springs from a use of terms. As compared with some tribes, they are as far removed from primitive man on one side as they are from civilized man on the other. 3 Picture-writing in the past, as in the present, has served the Hopi as a means of expression of their ideas of religious symbolism, and is most important in its teachings.

Symbols on Modern Pottery Intrusive. - One needs but a limited examination of collections of ancient and modern Hopi pottery to see how wide the differences are in the symbolic designs used in their decoration. It will be noticed that there are evidences of a radical change in form and technique in the modern ware, and that the pictorial designs upon them are very unlike. Perhaps the most important of all these changes, for our purposes, are those which show that the figures on the modern ware are not developments from designs on the ancient. While there is a remote similarity, more especially in geometric patterns, we no longer find, in modern pottery, designs representing quadrupeds, reptiles, and especially birds, which characterize ancient ornamented ware, but in their places figures of masks or grotesque human heads bearing intricate symbols on the faces, or with elaborate headdresses, feathers, flowers, terraces, and the like emblems. A reason for this radical change in the character of ornamental designs is not far to seek. A large majority of specimens of so-called modern Hopi pottery in our museums was not manufac- tured by descendants of Hopi potters, who made the ancient ware, but by women of Hano,1 whose ancestors were Tanoan colonists, and arrived in Tusayan near the beginning of the eighteenth cen- tury, long after the fine old Hopi pottery had been buried in the cemeteries of the ancient ruins. There can hardly be a doubt that these colonists introduced their own ideas of pottery manufacture and decoration, which the women bequeathed to their daughters. To answer the question how they came to have these ideas, we must look to ceramics in the graves of the pueblos where the ancestors of these pioneer colonists once lived, mainly along the Rio Grande River, several hundred miles away. The contact of these Tanoan and other eastern colonists with potters living in Walpi on their arrival, changed pottery manufacture and introduced a new decoration. New symbols replaced the ancient, although certain minor details of ancient decoration still survived, showing their influence in the innovations.2 The latter were, how- ever, insignificant when compared with alien pictures introduced by these colonists. The forms 3 and technique of modern Hopi pottery were changed One of the pueblos on the East Mesa. 2 Among these may be mentioned the terrace, spiral, broken bands, feathers, stars, crooks, and the like. 3 Modern Hopi food bowls, for instance, have a flaring rim, of which ancient bowls are destitute.</page><page sequence="5">7ournal of American Folk-Lore. by the advent of these new potters. One of the most striking of these innovations is the use of a white slip, over the body of the vessel, as a ground upon which to paint the designs. Old charac- teristic Hopi ware never has this superficial white layer, although it is common in that found in pueblos, ancient as well as modern, in the pueblo area east of Tusayan.1 Both these changes in form and technology point to the eastern region as the origin of modern styles in Tusayan pottery. It may, however, be said regarding this radical change in types of ancient pottery forms and symbolism, that descendants of the potters of old Walpi, Sikyatki, and other ruins still inhabit the modern Hopi pueblos. Why have they not clung more tenaciously to old forms and ancient symbolism, and why does not their pottery show a larger proportion of decorative elements inherited from their ancestors ? The modern pottery of the villages of both the Middle Mesa and Oraibi illustrates the same changes in the character of modern designs. How is this fact explained ? We here find our- selves hampered by poverty of exact data, but, from the few speci- mens of modern pottery which we are sure came from these pueblos, may offer the following observation. Although pottery-making is not, to any considerable extent, characteristic of the Middle Mesa, the reader may be reminded that the population of these pueblos, as well as Oraibi, has incorporated eastern clans, which furnished the same motives for modern decorations as the East Mesa. There are modern potters who still use modified geometrical pat- terns characteristic of ancient Hopi ware, but the potter's art, on the East Mesa, has practically fallen into the hands of Sitcomovi and Hano women, who are descended from people of Tanoan stock. Comparatively little pottery is now made at Walpi. In order to give a certainty to conclusions drawn from the pic- tography of Hopi ceramics, it is imperative to know definitely the pueblo in which each piece quoted was made, but unfortunately museum labels,2 and catalogues of modern ware, give little informa- tion in this particular, for the locality, "Moqui," and the name of the collector, is about the sum of the knowledge they convey. We are thus left in doubt, in studying a modern bowl, to know to which of 1 It is to the unequal expansion of the slip and the clay forming the body of a vessel, in firing, that modern Hopi pottery owes the crackled appearance by which it can be distinguished from ancient ware. The few specimens of black and white ware in which this white slip was used, found in Tusayan, are believed to be intrusive. 2 The intrinsic value, for scientific study, of an imperfectly labelled collection of pueblo pottery is small. Unfortunately, however, our great museums still con- tinue to pay large sums of money for these specimens, which are comparatively useless for exact studies. I76</page><page sequence="6">The Growth of the Hopi Ritual. seven villages to refer it. It would be advantageous to know not only the pueblo in which each piece of pottery was manufactured, but also the clan of the potter and her ancestry. Otherwise some confusion in making exact generalizations must inevitably result, rendering the teaching of pottery decoration more or less unsatis- factory. The same may be said of other products of Hopi artisans. Thus the manufacture of basketry is at present limited to the people of the Middle Mesa and Oraibi, but, as is well known to ethnologists, the basket plaques made at the latter pueblo are very different from those manufactured at the former. The special feature characteristic of pictures on modern pottery is the relatively large number of figures of supernatural beings which are now called Katcinas. The cult in which these beings are preeminent was, and still remains, that of those Tanoan pueblos from which the colonists came who settled Sitcomovi and Hano. It is but natural that the potters of Tanoan clans should retain their own mythology and make use of Katcina figures, which are the most prominent, in the decoration of their pottery, and there is no good reason why they should have abandoned it in their new homes. Let us examine some of the more important of these designs. Calako Mana. - Figures of this personage are more common than any others on modern pottery.1 The symbolism of this goddess is distinctive, easily recognized in its many variations, and characteris- tic of modern pottery. Personations of her in the modern ritual are confined to Katcina ceremonies, and the origin of the Calako mana conception is said to be outside of Tusayan. The most striking features of her symbolism, brought out in an accompanying plate, are terraced bodies representing rain-clouds on the head; an ear of maize symbol on the forehead; curved lines over the mouth; chevrons on the cheeks; conventionalized wings, and feathered garment. It is also not uncommon to find carved repre- sentations of squash blossoms occupying the same positions as the whorls of hair on the heads of Hopi maidens. The male Calako is likewise a common design readily recognized on modern pottery. Particularly abundant are figures of the mask of a Kohonino god, allied to Calako, which is likewise called a Katcina. Clown Priests. - Masked personages called clowns do not parti- cipate in any of the oldest ceremonies in the Hopi ritual, but are almost universally present in Katcina dances. Pictures of the heads of these clowns have not been found on 1 She is also represented on basketry, and two thirds of all the dolls used by the children portray this personage. I77</page><page sequence="7">yournal of American Folk-Lore. ancient pottery, but are very common on modern. This would indicate that they were lately introduced, and that the dances in which they occur are modern additions. The particular group of these clowns called Paiakyamu,1 which are so commonly represented on the handles of modern dippers, are characteristic of the Tanoan pueblo Hano, the potters of which pueblo made most of the pottery known as modern. Hahaiwuqti. - One of the most common figures on modern pot- tery is a picture of the mask of a goddess called Hahaiwiiqti, an earth goddess personified in the Powam22 or Bean-planting cere- mony, one of the most complicated of the Katcina series. Her symbolism is characteristic, viz., curved marks or crescents under the eyes and mouth. Kokle.- Pictures of the mask of Kokle are common on modern pottery, but they are never found on ancient vessels. The distinc- tive symbolism of this god is shown in an accompanying cut. Kokle is distinctively called a Katcina, which explains the appearance of this design on modern pottery.3 Pz]iikonhoya. - Figures of the war-god are constant emblems on modern pottery. The distinctive symbolism of the head of this god is the conical appendage to the head, and the two parallel marks on each cheek. While the little war-god is not a Katcina, it is one of the most prominent gods recognized by the people of Zunii, and those pueblos where the Katcina cult is dominant, and from which the colonists came who brought the modern symbolism. Stone images of this god from several Rio Grande pueblos have the same marks on head and face. Hopi picture-writing teaches that the ancient war-god was an Eagle man, a kind of thunder-bird, the little war-god of late introduction. If space allowed, several other figures of Katcinas, characteristic of modern pottery decoration, might be mentioned. Some of these were derived from the Kohoninos, others from Navajos or Apaches, but all are confined to modern ware, and are not found repre- sented on ancient pottery. The predominance of figures of Katcinas on modern ware, and their absence on ancient, indicates that the cult to which they belong is of late intrusion, or of equal age with their advent. If this 1 Clowns with a skull-cap and two straight leather horns on the head. Their bodies are painted with black and white bands, which are also found on the horns. See Jour. Am. Eth. and Arch. vol. ii. 2 This goddess is personated by a man in several ceremonies, and is called mother of gods. She is also called mother of the monsters and Katcinas. 3 I have not seen a personation of Kokle, but it is said to have appeared on the day following the altar ceremonies of the Winter Solstice at Oraibi in 1897. 178</page><page sequence="8">PLATE II PUUKONHOYA HAHAIWUQTI</page><page sequence="9">The Growth of the Hopi Ritual. cult is of late introduction, naturally the question may be asked, whence its source? We instinctively look, for its former home, to those pueblos of New Mexico where Katcina worship survives; and if we accept the evidences, both of tradition and linguistics, its deri- vation from Eastern pueblos is well near proven. There is little doubt that the worship of several Katcinas came to Moki from Zufi, and it is worthy of note that the names of many have a strong resemblance, even identity, in Hopi, Zufii, and Keresan tongues. We also discover a similarity between the modern Katcina sym- bolism of Hano and that.of Zufii, Acoma, and pueblos along the Rio Grande. The only way to satisfactorily determine the age of this cult in these pueblos is to have before us large and accurately labelled collections of pottery from ancient ruins near these last mentioned pueblos, but unfortunately such collections have not yet been made. The pictography of pottery from ancient Zunian, Tanoan, and Keresan ruins possibly never reached the high development of that of Tusayan; but if an intimate study of large collections indicates that they are not found in the symbolism of ancient pueblos of the eastern parts of the pueblo area,' it is possible that the peculiar development of picture-writing in Tusayan may be of local growth, confined to that region. Even if the ancestral cemeteries of the people who brought the cult into Tusayan shows no pottery with pictures of Katcinas, it is possible that this absence is due to an undeveloped art of decoration. It is not improbable that a study of the cemeteries of the ruin called Paytipki, on the Middle Mesa, may shed some light on this question. This pueblo was deserted about the year 1742, and its people returned to the Rio Grande and were settled at Sandia,2 near Albuquerque, a few years later. It has been supposed that the people of this pueblo were Tanoan colonists; hence a study of the mortuary pottery from the Hopi ruin of this name might reveal a picture-writing similar to modern Tanoan decoration. We may yet find ruins of the settlements of the ancestors of the people of Hano on the Rio Grande, or trace resemblances in modern pottery designs back to that of their old homes. If we require linguistic evidence to support legends in a theory of the late advent of this cult into Tusayan, we need only instance the word Katcina, common to both Keresan and Tanoan stocks. The 1 A study of the pictography of the pottery of the Chaco ruins by a specialist familiar with the modern ritual of Jemez and Sia is much to be desired. 2 No eastern pueblo has been more neglected by'ethnologists than Sandia. There must be in this pueblo considerable lore connected with the early life in Tusayan. I79</page><page sequence="10">yournal of American Folk-Lore. Hopi have special names for some of these Katcinas indicating their origin from eastern pueblos; thus, Sio (Zuni) Katcina, a well- known summer dance, and Kawaika (Keresan) Katcinas, which appear in the Hopi ceremony called Powamu. Clown priests at Sitcomovi are often called Koyimse, a word the resemblance of which to the Zufi name of the same is evident. The name Calako is common to both Hopis and Zufis. In fact, a considerable vocabulary of Keresan, Tanoan, and Zufiian names, applied by the Hopi to personations in their Katcina celebrations, add linguistic evidence that this cult is common to several pueblos, and point to the stocks from which the names were derived. Picture-writing thus shows that this cult was lately added to the Hopi ritual, and while the exact date is not now known, legends declare that it was brought to Tusayan by colonists who arrived in the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries. To a second question, from whence came the Katcina cult when brought to Walpi, we have already indicated a more definite answer. The dwellings of the Katcinas are traditionally said to lie in the four cardinal points, - Kicuba in the north, Mt. Taylor in the east, Winima, near Saint Johns, in the south, and the San Francisco mountain in the west.1 The place called Winima, not far from the town of Saint Johns, known to the Zufiis as a sacred place, is likewise regarded by them a home of the Koko, the Zufii equivalent of the Katcina. As the traditions of both these pueblos centre on this place, it is not unlikely that at least some of the Katcinas were known to people who once lived in that neighborhood. This place is distinctively stated to be the home of Shalako by both Zufis and the Hopi. Having in the preceding pages placed before the reader the evi- dences that designs on modern pottery were of late introduction, and that they generally refer to a certain cult, I conclude that this cult was intrusive rather than autochthonous among the Hopi, and I am led to outline what I regard the essential primary elements of the Hopi religion in order to get a clearer notion of the relation of this added cult to those preexisting. THE HOPI RELIGION A COMPOSITE TOTEMISM. The Hopi religion is largely totemism, and still preserves many survivals of primitive conditions of that form of worship. By totem- ism I mean the attitude of individuals and clans to their totems. The recognition of this relation of the man or his clan to their totems is, I believe, a well-nigh universal form of religion which, among the Hopi, has become highly developed into a complicated 1 Whether this indicates the sources from which this worship was derived is, of course, an open question. i8o</page><page sequence="11">The Growth of the Hopi Ritual. I8 system or composite clan totemism, with which has been incorporated certain elements borrowed from lower or higher foreign religious systems.1 "A totem," says Frazer, "is a class of material objects which a savage regards with superstitious respect, believing that there exists between him and every member of the class an intimate and alto- gether special relation. ... As distinguished from a fetish, a totem is never an isolated individual, but always a class of objects." Three kinds of totems are recognized by this author: (I) the clan totem, common to a whole clan, and passing by inheritance from generation to generation; (2) the sex totem, common either to all the males or to all the females of a tribe, to the exclusion in either case of the other sex; (3) the individual totem, belonging to a single individual and not passing to his descendants. It is supposed by some authors that clan totemism has two aspects which, in certain advanced stages, are readily separated, but in earlier conditions are inseparable or blend into each other. Briefly told, the relation of the man to his totem is the religious, that of the man to other members of the clan the social side of totemism. There is every reason to suppose that formerly these two aspects were not differentiated, or that man's attitude towards the totem, and conduct towards other members of his clan, were much the same. This has led me to suppose that the attitude of man to ancestral totems is really the religious aspect of totemism, that of man to living members of his clan the social aspect of totemism, and that the two phases explain each other. In many primitive people they are interchangeable, but in the evolution of culture there is a well-marked divergence between them. In studying the social and religious organization of the Hopi we recognize in totemism a foundation of the whole structure, and there is reason to suppose that the same is true of all the other pueblos in New Mexico. It is strange that, although totemism is so well marked among the Hopi, its importance among these Indians has been so often overlooked. In his general account of the geographi- cal diffusion of totemism, Frazer neglects to refer to it among the pueblos,2 although through Bourke's " Snake Dance " he was familiar with the names of several Moki clans, and constantly refers to Moki and other pueblo totems. 1 The social and religious sides of totemism are inseparable, but when I refer to totemism it is more especially to the religious side. 2 It is also remarkable that this author makes so scanty references to the exist- ence of totemism in Central America or Mexico. I cannot explain this oversight, for to my mind the descriptions of the Spanish writers, the aboriginal monuments, codices, and decorations show that the ancient religions of Mexico and Central America were saturated with totemism.</page><page sequence="12">7ournal of American Folk-Lore. Modern Hopi totemism is not, however, of a simple kind, but on account of the existence of many totems, due to the composite nature of the population, is highly modified. It is not difficult to prove, by means of legends, that certain pueblos now in ruins were peopled by a phratry composed of related clans, or even single fami- lies, recognizing totems which each person in that family regarded in a religious way. If religious organizations existed in those pueblos, each member in any one village belonged to the same phratry or clan, and the religious society was practically limited to the clan or made up of its members. When in course of time other clans, each with its distinctive totemism, joined the nucleus, what happened ? By intermarriage, members of the added clan were brought into close relation with the totemism of the existing family, and priesthoods were no longer limited to the original clan. Thus a composite clan system arose, and one or more forms of totemism were united. The members of such a society not only recognized in a religious relation their own clan totems, but also those of other families. The worship characteristic of the different clans thus brought in contact reacted on each other, and was in turn modified in a corresponding degree. The present condition of the Hopi ritual is paralleled by that of Peru in early times, when the worship of countless minor huacas held sway, before an Inca sought to abolish the worship of many minor deities, and absorb it into a solar worship. It is needless to say that an autochthonous development of the Hopi religion has ceased. It had reached a form of sun worship, but the monotheistic system which is destined to supplant it is separated by thousands of years of development and brought in by an alien people. Left to itself, the Hopi ritual followed a line of growth parallel with that of Peru or Egypt,l but never advanced as high as either, although it was only a little lower than the former. We find, in other words, that the religious clan totemism has expanded into cults directed by religious societies, the members of which are no longer restricted to the narrow bounds of clan kinship, and that a unification into sun and element worship has developed. It is held that we have in this condition no longer a simple clan religious totemism, but a composite form made up of diverse totem- isms which have mutually reacted upon each other. The tendency of this union is to obscure the original form of clan worship and to In the most ancient Egyptian cults each nome had its special god. A unifica- tion of these gods dates from the sixth dynasty. Vide " R. Pietschmann, ,Egypt. Fetishdienst und G6tterglaube," Zeit. f. Eth. Bd. x.

Many and diverse agencies are involved in bringing about these results. Some of the forms of worship which were added to those already existing have themselves been derived from systems which have passed beyond simple clan totemism. In some particulars the modern ritual is a patchwork, which makes it more desirable to go back historically and study the early stages of each component. We have, in other words, a condi- tion so complicated that the earlier condition from which it sprang is more or less masked. It is well to examine influences which have obscured the essential element of the primary clan totemism. Totemism as a religion is, as above stated, the relation of man individually or collectively to his totem. Certain acts in the life of the individual, pertaining essentially to kinship relations, may be contrasted with those pertaining to a collection of related individuals or so-called priesthoods. The choice of the individual totem and relations to it are religious for the same reason. My subject deals with clan totems, the first group mentioned by Frazer. Individual relations to the clan totem are the simplest and prob- ably the oldest. These, among others, include birth rites, initiation rites, and mortuary ceremonies. Simple ceremonies of this kind may be explained as primarily expressions of effort to identify the individual with the clan totem. The efforts of collections of indi- viduals or religious societies to bring themselves into relations with the clan totems are primary elements of the ritual and have devel- oped into the yearly calendar. In the growth of the ritual, adaptation to environment has played a most conspicuous secondary part. The present Hopi ritual re- flects the arid climate characteristics of northeastern Arizona, but there is no reason to suppose that the ancestors of those who now practise it always lived in the same environment that they now do. On the other hand, it is more than probable that, far back in the past, their surroundings were wholly different. Suppose, for instance, that these ancestors were hunters, or lived in a well-watered country, and were not dependent on agriculture. Whatever rites and ceremonials they then had would have far different objects from those now practised, for rain-making and growth of crops would not occupy any considerable place in the rites of fishermen or hunters. The totemism of a people passing from the hunter culture stage into the agricultural status in an arid climate would be profoundly modi- fied by environment, and the object of their rites would change. The ancient totemism would be retained with changed meaning, and become highly specialized in the line of the new culture. Thus it is that there remain many ancient rites with a radically different I83</page><page sequence="14">yournal of American Folk-Lore. meaning from that which they once had. The ritual is not recon- structed de novo, as the purpose of the rites change, but preexisting forms of zobtotemism, or other worship, are modified and made to do duty for the agriculturalist under the new conditions. We can recognize with difficulty the ancient forms in a few remaining sur- vivals. Totemism survives all the changes, for it is the psychic material out of which environment has built a form of ritual especially adapted to a people living an agricultural life in the arid sands of Arizona. Initiations. - The modus operandi in initiations 1 shows in a marked manner the survival of a simple original clan totemism. Thus, in initiations into religious societies, a novice chooses a father or sponsor from among the members. The head of the novitiate is baptized by the oldest woman of the clan, and by this rite he cere- monially becomes a son or brother. This is a characteristic of clan totemism, and the act of initiation is supposed to strengthen the bond between novice and clan totem. The novice is taught the secrets of the particular society which holds the totem in its keep- ing. Sacerdotal membership is a survival of clan membership before the religious society had outgrown the family, and the novitiate is inducted into both in the same way. The mode of addresses and responses of members of the same religious society in secret rites may be a survival of former limita- tion of members to the same clan. Among these terms may be mentioned "my younger brother," "my elder brother," "my father," "my son." Men using these terms are often of different clans, and a youth of nineteen may be addressed by a man of sixty as " my grandfather." I believe these terms can best be explained on the theory that the sacerdotal society was once limited to family relatives. Mortuary Ceremonies. - A fundamental idea of the rites over the body of the dead is to make more intimate the connection of the clansman and his totem. This is especially the purport of their prayers at that time. The deceased by death becomes closer to the ancestral totemic beings than the living; therefore the burden of the mortuary prayer is a request to use this enlarged power to bring the rains and make the crops grow.2 1 Into religious societies. The youth may at the same time become cognizant of his individual totem through vigils and fasts. 2 If we believe that a totem is not a single but collective " object,"- not an individual, but a "class," -death makes more intimate the relationship of the deceased with all ancestors of the same totem, and in the changed relation of the living to the dead we pass from the social to the religious sides of clan totemism. I84</page><page sequence="15">The Growth of the Hopi Ritual. This is certainly a secondary object of mortuary prayers, and can be ascribed to a changed environment. A people whose culture had not made their life dependent on the growth of corn, but who lived by hunting or fishing, would not urge the dead to send the rains to water their land. Hopi Clan Totemism masked by Environment. - Totemism, a uni- versal characteristic of religion in its early stages, has been modified by environment. Among the pueblos, their arid surroundings and the agricultural status has modified their totemism along the line of rain-making and growth of corn. Among the hunters, another environment has developed totemism along different lines, and so widely have these lines diverged that the results are widely different. The substratum of both is, however, a totemism of almost identical character among most races of men. Totemism thus originates as a psychic phenomenon; its modifications are due to climatic or other environment conditions. Relation of Clan Priests and Religious Societies. --When the population of a pueblo was limited to a clan or closely related kins- men, the participants in the existing rites which made their cult were obviously members of the clan. This condition probably existed in many pueblos, now ruins, in the neighborhood of the Little Colorado, or in old Walpi when inhabited by only one family. But as Walpi grew in size and the population was enlarged by the addition of several clans, the ritual came to be celebrated by reli- gious societies, membership in which was not limited to any one family. It is manifestly important to understand the relationship of the modern society of priests to that limited to one clan, whether the former was evolved from the latter or originated independently. Mr. Frazer has, I believe, recognized the true relation, which he states as follows: " However, in the Snake Band of the Moquis we have an instance of a kinship group expanding by natural growth into a religious association, and this is probably not an isolated case." It has been stated by good authorities that the modern organiza- tion of religious societies among pueblos is wholly independent of the clan, which is undoubtedly true of some of the societies among the Hopi as well. Although each religious society contains men and women of many clans, the fact remains that the chiefs of any society generally come from the family of the same name as the society and hold hereditary positions. It seems to me that these apparently divergent views are in strict harmony, and that the modern Hopi religious society is in most instances simply an expanded kinship group. It has been suggested that some of these religious societies origi- I85</page><page sequence="16">yournal of American Folk-Lore. nated from individual totems, which is not impossible, but clan totems may have had the same origin, and there is nothing in this belief to prevent one recognizing the clan totem as an interme- diate stage in development. The "individual totem," says Frazer, "begins and ends with the individual man, and is not, like the clan totem, transmitted by inheritance." . . . The "individual totem," he says, "in America, is usually the first animal of which a youth dreams during the long and generally solitary fasts which American Indians observe at puberty." This individual totem, which at times may grade into the clan, is ordinarily held to be distinct; the indi- vidual inheriting his clan totem, but obtaining his peculiar totem by ecstatic experience. As it is the clan totem which is hereditary, it would appear that, among the Hopi, standing in a religious society came through that line rather than the other. In an analysis of the personnelle of the different religious societies at Walpi, I find none of them which do not include, among its mem- bership, representatives of most of the prominent Walpi families; but in most instances the foremost priests, and especially the chief, belong to certain clans, and hold their position in the religious society by descent in that family. Moreover, the fetishes or society badges and altar paraphernalia are said to have been introduced into Walpi by ancestors of the same family, members of which are now recognized as the chiefs in the celebration of the rites. These facts tell in favor of the conclusion that Hopi celebrations are composite, and formed of several family rites brought to Walpi as successive families joined the original settlements, and that, if we wish to trace back to its origin the present ritual, we come in no short time historically to a number of component family religions remotely connected with each other. There is no reason to sup- pose that these components are membra disjecta of any one system of worship, but rather the survivals of several independent cults peculiar to different families, among which they have originated, following parallel laws of development. Influence of one Clan Totemism on another. -The influences of one family totemism on others of a cluster are important, and the longer clans have been associated the greater this influence. Thus the modification of the Flute by the Snake ceremonies is shown by many common rites. In the Winter Solstice Ceremony several rites have been consolidated, masking in a way the simple Sun- serpent worship of the ancient ceremony of the Patki clans at that time. When the social kinship becomes closest, the tendency to interchange rites is most evident. While most conservative in the retention of rites, an increase in their complexity is going on con- 1 Many instances might be mentioned of rites purchased by one tribe from its I86</page><page sequence="17">The Growth of the Hopi Ritual. tinually. The limitation of the religious society to the clan which introduced it is least marked in warrior societies, as would naturally be the case on account of their sociologic relationship. Warrior Societies. -In a community like Walpi, composed of many families, we should expect in warrior societies less signs of limitation to any one clan. From the very nature of these socie- ties, consolidation would result for protection of the whole popula- tion, but even in them we detect traces of their former limitations to clans. Thus the Warrior Society called the Kwakwantu is dis- tinctly a fraternity of the Patki clans, and legends declare the warrior Kalektaka, corresponding with the Bow Priests of eastern pueblos, to have been introduced in late time by colonists from Zufi or the Rio Grande villages. Each clan, before it joined the original nucleus at Walpi, had its warrior chief and society, which, after union, in times of attack from foreign foes, would join warrior societies of other clans, and later merge into the strongest. Thus in warrior societies we find that the limitation to any single clan has almost disappeared; but elsewhere it is different, and those ethnologists who deny all connection between the clan and religious society, among the pueblos, may have been led astray by studies of the present condition, without due regard to the past, or may have limited their studies to warrior societies. The belief that there is no restriction in the present roll of mem- bership of a religious society to any one clan, or that the members of a society are now not limited to a certain clan, presents no valid objection to the theory of a former limitation, which is practically what is now found in some cases at Walpi. But it is possible that there may be a difference in this regard in the personnelle of reli- gious societies in tribes having the matriarchal and patriarchal sys- tems of descent. Thus, acccording to Miss Fletcher, "among the Omahas the membership in religious societies came from every kinship group in the tribe; blood relationship was ignored, the body of union being a common right in a common vision, and the simplest form of social action was in the religious societies whose structure was based upon the grouping together of men who had received similar visions." While among the Hopi warrior societies there is something akin to this condition among the Omahas, in the majority of religious societies the clan is important in the determination of the personnelle of the religious society.1 The clan among the Hopi neighbor. These commercial transactions are sometimes attempted without suc- cess. Thus several years ago the Zufis tried to purchase the Snake ceremony from the Walpi priests, and although many sheep, horses, etc., were offered, the Walpians would not sell. 1 The chiefs and most important members become so by descent in the female line, -the Snake chief from Snake family, etc. i87</page><page sequence="18">yournal of American Folk-Lore. is determined by descent on the mother's side; thus the majority of the Snake priests belong to the Snake family. Hopi Clan Totems Anthropomorphic. - It is a common belief in the lower grades of totemism that members of the clan are descended from the totem after which it is named. Where the totems are animals, the descent is often said to be from animals and the ances- tral clan parent is zoomorphic; but in most instances the clan totem ancestor is regarded anthropomorphic as well as zo6morphic. It is instructive to note that among those clans which claim to have been descended from an animal whose name they bear, there are constant references in their legends to the metamorphosis of these zoomor- phic parents into men and women. I think it could hardly be said that the members of the Snake clan worship reptiles, but regard them as of the same kinship as themselves, and therefore will not harm them. Their worship seems rather directed to ancestors of the same clan as themselves, and especially the parents of the clan. A belief in the metamorphosis of the dead into reptiles is probable. The clan ancestress is a mythic human-animal being called the Snake woman. When the totems are inanimate, as sun, water, light- ning, corn, the clan totem ancestors are likewise anthropomorphic, and their worship the central idea of the cultus. Anthropomorphic Totems Ancestors. - These anthropomorphic totems are, as is generally the case, personated by ancestral beings. The members of the clan were originally thought to have descended from its totem, and as long as the society was limited to the family this descent was regarded as natural; but when the society outgrew the family, we pass from natural to sacerdotal kinship. Ancestor worship and totemism of the society do not part company in this change. As the society and its membership is taken from different clans, the family worship of the original clan remains the central part of the worship. Hopi Clan Totems Dualistic. -We have seen that the Hopi an- oestral clan totem, even when zoimorphic, is regarded as also anthro- pomorphic. It is likewise dualistic; the ancestral personages, part human, part beast, are dual, male and female. Each religious so- ciety has a cultus hero "father totem" and "mother totem," which are worshipped. 1 I am aware that many ethnologists may not accept my extension of the word " totem " to include the anthropomorphic conception. The idea of descent from a bear, snake, badger, etc., totem is almost universal, and the endowment of that totem with a partially human form is prevalent even in the lowest stages of totem- ism. While the original meaning of the term among some races may be less elastic, I find the broader extension here adopted most convenient in the absence of a definite nomenclature. I88</page><page sequence="19">The Growth of the Hopi Ritual. I89 It is but a step in development to pass from dualistic anthropo- morphic associated clan totems into a higher stage, or the worship of those more prominent or common to all the associated families. The inevitable tendency of the union of a number of clans, each observing its own worship, would be to consolidate and endow certain gods common to all other forms of totemism with greater powers. Especially would this result when the barrier restricting membership to families was broken down and persons from other clans were admitted into priesthoods. Nature power totems would thus naturally absorb or replace beast or plant totems. In the development of religious conceptions and practices man, says Payne, "ultimately advances from waste to economy. .. . As the dependence on agriculture becomes more and more absolute, the development of religion and religious ceremonies become more and more marked. . . . Experience teaches man that the return which the earth yields to his labors is precarious; and when his crop fails he explains it by supposing that he has neglected some among the powers who are able to influence the results of his labors." Thus it is that new gods propitious to agriculture are borrowed from neighbors, and those in his own system concerned with growth exalted. Both of these tendencies mask the original form of clan totemism. It is but natural that with an agricultural people nature power totems should ever be in the ascendency over beast totems, and in passing into an agricultural condition man modifies a pre- existing beast-god worship to suit his new needs. Modern Survival of the Ancient Worship of Component Clans.- It is instructive to examine the probable condition of clan totemism before the amalgamation of the component families, in order to comprehend its modified character in the present religion at Walpi. What, for instance, was the nature of the clan totem rites of the Snake people before other families found it, or what was the char- acter of the worship of the Water-House people while they lived in the now ruined pueblos near Winslow, Arizona, seventy miles south of Walpi ? In other words, to analyze the present composite ritual of Walpi, it is desirable to know something of that of the compo- nents. We have legends to guide us in this investigation which must be taken in connection with those survivals of clan totemism which remain in the modern ritual. As an examination of the peculiarities of those ceremonials which each family claim that its ancestors brought to Walpi would be a great aid to our investiga- tions, I have chosen those of some of the more important families for this line of study. It may thus appear that many causes have been at work to obscure the original character of the clan totemism which consti- VOL. XI. NO. 42. 14</page><page sequence="20">Journal of American Folk-Lore. tuted the original form of worship, while yet the component clans lived isolated from each other. Still there are many survivals of this ancient worship, and the next step in our discussion is to try to determine the probable worship of each family before it joined the others. This is an intricate task, and one of highly theoretical character.' It involves the determination of the probable nature of the religion of at least four chief and numerous subordinate clans. The latter we can hardly hope to consider, but we may attempt to sketch general outlines of the totemism of the four main families, the Snake, Flute, Patki, and those clans which brought the Katcina cult. Snake Family. -The ceremonies of the Snake and Antelope priesthoods are particularly instructive in this study from the fact that the Snake family, if not the oldest in Walpi, is the most ancient of those whose rites have come down to our time. In considering this subject we must discriminate between the worship of the Great Plumed Snake, which was brought to Walpi by another family, the Patki, and the original clan worship of the Snake people. The Snake Dance is one of the best examples which could be mentioned of a survival of clan totemism of a primitive character, showing the influence of environment in modification. Its present object is rain and abundant corn, the element of primitive worship which it shares2 with all other Hopi ceremonies; its totem is the reptile which no other family, save the Snake, regard in that light. The Snake Dance shows a composition of two zo6totemisms, that of the Snake and Antelope, and the features in common may be inter- preted as due to long association of these two families. There are two surviving ceremonies of the religion of the ancient Snake family still observed in the ritual at Walpi. One of these is the well-known Snake Dance, which occurs in August every odd year; and the other the simple meeting of the Antelope and Snake chiefs in midwinter, generally in January of the same years in which the Snake Dance is performed. The present condition of the Snake totem worship is a highly modified one. A continuous residence in an arid environment in the agricultural status has modified this zo6totemism into a compli- cated form of rain and growth ceremonies. While many survivals 1 I cherish the hope that in much the same way in which we can associate the modern picture-writing with the Katcina cult, and use it in studies of the growth of the Hopi ritual, some day we may be able to distinguish the pictography of other Tusayan cults, as the Patki and Snake families. This can be done by the co6p- eration of legends and archaeology. The picture-writing found in a ruin peopled, according to legends, exclusively by Patki clans, must by necessity be made up of Patki symbolism. 2 Evidently due to environment. I90</page><page sequence="21">The Growth of the Hopi Ritual. of a former condition still exist in the rites of Snake priests, change of culture and contact with agricultural clans has radically modified the intent of the ancient ceremonies, although their outward forms are still preserved. The dualistic, ancestral, anthropomorphic parent totems of the Snake Society are the Snake Hero and Snake Maid, whose person- ifications in the worship of this society have been described else- where. Horn Family. - The most important survival in the present Hopi ritual of the rites and ceremonials of the Ala or Horn gentes is called the Lelentu or Flute Festival, which is so closely related to the Snake Dance that I have been led to believe that both are survivals of an ancient ritual in use when two groups of clans made up the whole population. Theoretically I suppose, as tradition records, that the Snake and Horn or Flute families lived together, and that they separated from their ancient association, but after many wanderings reunited at Walpi, as dramatized in the way else- where described.1 Descendants of some of the Horn people, who cast their lot with the Snake clans when the ancient separation took place, form the Antelope priesthood, one of the two societies which observe the present Snake Dance. 'As with the Snake clans, there are two surviving ceremonies of the Flute clans still practised in Walpi. One of these is that mentioned above, the great Flute observance, which occurs on even years; and the other a simple meeting of the chiefs, which takes place in January of the same years. The Walpi Flute ceremony presents an instructive example of a decadent rite. One of two ancient sections of the Flute Society has wholly disappeared at Walpi, and with it has vanished important rites which are still kept up in other Tusayan pueblos. The dualistic anthropomorphic ancestors of the Flute clans are the Flute Hero and the Flute Maid represented on the Flute altars by effigies, and in the public dance by a boy and two girls. Patki or Water-House Family. - How long the Snake, Horn, and possibly some other less conspicuous clans lived together on the ancient site of Walpi, and observed their characteristic cultus, before they were joined by the Patki clans, I do not know; but with the advent of these clans, which came from the far south, several strange gods and many unusual rites and ceremonials were 1 The similarities of the Snake and Flute totemism may of course be explained by mutual interaction after the clans to which they are peculiar came together, or, as shown in a previous article, before they separated. The dramatization of their reunion, biennially observed at Walpi in the Flute observance, would favor the latter interpretation. I9I</page><page sequence="22">7ournal of American Folk-Lore. introduced. The most important additions were new forms of worship of the Sun, the Great Plumed Snake, and Kwataka, the eagle of the sky. The original clan totem of the Snake priesthood was an animal; that of the Patki and kindred clans, an anthropomor- phism, in which the clan totems were the sun, rain, lightning, and other inanimate powers. The Patki and related societies thus brought to Walpi a higher form of worship than that preexisting. This is shown both in the higher totems which they recognized and in the character of the worship. Up to the advent of this family, beast-god worship had been prominent; a dominant factor in the religion of the Patki people was a form of Solar and Plumed Snake worship.1 There still exist four great ceremonials which contain many sur- vivals of the original ritual of the Patki people. These occur near the solstices and equinoxes, and are called by the following names: Summer Solstice, Tawapaholauni; Winter Solstice, Soyalufia; Spring Equinox, Paliilikonti; Autumn Equinox, Lalakonti. Of these, the first three are preeminently solar rites. In the second and third we find elements introduced by the Katcinas which originally did not exist in the worship of the Patki people. They also contain great serpent rites, as elsewhere described. Much of the New Fire ceremony celebrated in November is alSo due to clans which came from the same southern country as the Water-House people, and the same Warrior societies participate in the two rites. I am, however, not wholly sure in regard to the source of this interesting ceremony. The contribution of the Patki clans greatly enlarged the cere- monial calendar, and at the present day four important rites are under its control,2 while there are but two great ceremonies which are survivals of the Snake clans, and the same number of the Horn people. A parallel worship of dualistic, anthropomorphic totem ancestors, similar to that in the Snake and Flute families, exists also in the Water-House or Patki clan worship. They are called Kwataka, the Eagle Man, and the Soyalufia Maid. In dramatic personations of the latter the same 3 facial decoration and other symbolism are used in ceremonies of the Snake, Flute, and Soyalufia. 1 Certain forms of beast-god worship were brought to Walpi by this contingent. 2 Such an important ceremony, for instance, as the Winter Solstice contains, as I have shown, elements taken from several sources: it is a " synchronous meeting" of many societies from several clans, a composite rite, but the main characters and the most distinctive survival in it is the Sun-serpent worship intro- duced by the Patki people who control the rites. 3 Which I interpret as due to contact of the totemism of the three families. I92</page><page sequence="23">The Growth of the Hopi Ritual. Families from Eastern Pueblos. -The contribution of these families to the ritual was the important Katcina cult, which has now reached a great development, with a ritual extending over half the ceremonial year. This cult has been an ever-growing one in its influence, and new increments have been added even in the last generation.' Tusayan has been the asylum of many people from the Rio Grande since.I68o, and these colonists have added several new forms of Katcina worship. Some of these were derived from Zufii, others from Jemez, Acoma, and Sia. From a cult once unknown at Walpi it has now come to be all-important, modifying all others. There have been sporadic contributions to the Hopi ritual which have not been brought by any particular family. One of the best illustrations of these is the Mamzrauti, introduced from Awatobi when that village was destroyed.2 These ceremonies were probably very complicated when they were added to the ritual, and it is impossible to trace their development in their native pueblos. The Hopi ritual continually added to in these ways has grown to a condition in which one of the last additions, viz., the Katcina cult, has become a dominant one. The other cults are still practised with vigor, but are simply survivals and have long ceased to grow. Katcina elements have modified these, and they would probably, in course of time, become extinct, or would be replaced by new forms of Katcinas, were it not that colonists have now practically ceased to bring these new increments. Under the present influences of contact with white men aboriginal ceremonials will gradually disap- pear. The spectacular Katcina dances will probably survive longer than any other, and a Snake Dance will no doubt attract visitors across the desert for years to come. As an object of scientific study, and as affording data for the determination of the laws of growth of a native American religion, the Hopi ritual henceforth presents decadence rather than growth. The effect of Christian influence on the future ritual of the Hopi people is outside the scope of this article. SUMMARY. As far as can be sketched from material at hand, the growth of the Hopi ritual has been somewhat as follows: The earliest cult was that of the Snake family, a form of zoototomism, the most important surviving ceremony of which is the famous Snake Dance. 1 The so-called Sio-Calako, or Zufii Shalako. 2 The date when Mamzrauti was added to the Tusayan ritual is known through legendary and historical data. It was at the close of I700. Owakiilti, which was introduced about the same time, is extinct at Walpi. I93</page><page sequence="24">7ournal of American Folk-Lore. The first addition to this was the contribution of the Horn family, whose important survival in modern times is the Flute ob- servance. The Water-House or Cloud people added a solar and rain-cloud totemism, with equinoctial and solstitial ceremonies and the worship of a Plumed Serpent. Several clans, mostly from the East, introduced a composite cult, in which zo6totemism and nature element worship are combined and divinized ancestors represented by characteristic masked per- sonifications called Katcinas. There were other additions from conquered pueblos, as Sikyatki and Awatobi, and still others, the origin of which I am ignorant. The growth has been a development by addition of new and an evolution and modification of existing elements. Every incoming family has added its peculiar rites, while neighboring pueblos which have been conquered have contributed their quota, making a com- plex ritual unexcelled in any tribe still living in the United States. The totemism of component families has taken the form of elab- orate monthly ceremonies, the participants in which are no longer limited to the clan by which the ceremony was introduced. Totem worship in each has become the worship of anthropomorphic par- ents, male and female, a reverence which amounts to worship of the souls of the dead; of beasts or animals as sharing in part a supernatural element possibly due to metempsychosis, and of the great elements foreign to simple totemism.
