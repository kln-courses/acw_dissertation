<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 210  Book Reviews  Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary.  By Michael Schumacher and Denis Kitchen.   New York: Bloomsbury USA, 2013. 305pp.       Reviewed by   Daniel F. Yezbick     Midway through Schumacher and Kitchen’s firm, focused  portrait of Al Capp, we find the truculent satirist wrestling  with a pesky set of embroilments. In a desperate letter to his  estranged lover, Hollywood nightclub siren Nina Luce, the  celebrated creator of Li’l Abner, Abbie and Slats, Fearless  Fosdick, and The Schmoo, confesses, “Inside of me there is  a restlessness, a badness, that will never – I know that – give  me peace . . . It’s a restlessness that makes playing as vital to  me as breathing” (106). Perhaps no other episode in Schu- macher and Kitchen’s evocative biography so poignantly  crystallizes the complex, often disquieting themes of self- destructive “playfulness” and relentless perversity that  plagued the comic strips’ most volatile personality. Though  his many resilient works of comedy, satire, and commentary are likened to those of  Dickens and Twain, and despite the lifelong regard of luminaries ranging from John  Steinbeck and John Updike to Richard Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover, the most valuable  element of this new biography might be its unflinching portrayal of Capp’s own ob- session with confrontation and competition.   As a scathing social critic, political pundit, and all-around contrarian, Al  Capp remains a tough subject for many scholars, critics, and biographers, but Shu- macher and Kitchen have given his story exactly what it requires: a wisely detached  and shrewdly detailed objectivity that reveals Capp, “warts and all,” as the ambitious  and resourceful, yet insufferable conundrum that he surely was. From first page to  last, Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary offers an efficiently structured and utterly read- able portrait of a complicated, compromised man. The biography also provides a  clear, intelligent, and impeccably researched assessment of his influence as a humor- ist and curmudgeon, drawing on an impressive range of source materials, including  Capp’ own letters, family manuscripts, historical documents, and period newspapers,  as well as academic discourse on American comics and fan forums. There may be no  better authority on Capp than Kitchen. A pioneer in the archival compilation of clas- sic American newspaper strips like Li’l Abner and Eisner’s The Spirit, Kitchen was  also an innovator in avant-garde, underground comix, and his reputation as an artist,  historian, and publisher has clearly facilitated his access to a number of key sources  that greatly enhance the book’s historical accuracy and emotional verisimilitude.  Benefiting also from a seasoned biographer, like Michael Schumacher, the resulting  text develops a gripping, fluid movement that will sustain the interest of general  readers as well as scholars of American history, journalism, satire, and cultural/media  </page> <page sequence="2"> Studies in American Humor  211  studies. The work is also foundational reading for comics studies and disability stud- ies specialists for its frank and revealing portrayal of Capp’s lifelong interest in  coaching young and troubled amputees in times of war and peace. The most fulfilling  “meat” of Capp’s story, however, concerns the more anxious side of the funny-book  auteur who carved a rich, new mode of country bumpkin comedy out of sheer chutz- pah, moxie, and sass.   As Shumacher and Kitchen’s narrative progresses, we encounter every side  of Capp’s relentless determination to rise above just about everything he knows. First,  we pity the handicapped teenage miscreant desperate to prove his manliness and re- silience in a hard, brutal world. We then encounter the young adult scam artist eager  to badger his way into the comics business. With marriage and parenthood, Capp  transforms into a fiercely competitive professional who never stops hammering out  new novelties to bolster Li’l Abner’s lucrative popularity. As the guiding voice of  Capp Enterprises, he epitomizes the opportunistic entrepreneur who fights tirelessly  with his detractors, his assistants, his syndicate, and even his own family, always  striving to expose his comic-strip creations to new and bigger audiences through ra- dio, film, stage, and television deals as well as an advertising premiums, theme parks,  and publicity stunts. Meanwhile, another darker, more desperately “restless” persona  emerges Capp as a stingy taskmaster, compulsive womanizer, and unrepentant phi- landerer whose torrid affairs, difficult marriage, and eventual sex scandals continual- ly torment his long-suffering wife, siblings, and children.   It’s easy to notice something disturbing, desperate, and rapacious in Capp’s  reckless history of schemes, feuds, and donnybrooks. For those who want it, the book  is full of details concerning the affairs, lawsuits, scandals, and generally bad behav- iors that drove Capp to both immense success and intense misery. Thankfully, the  authors refuse to wallow in what may seem very old or unnecessary dirt. Chief  among these concerns are Capp’s pathetic sexual indiscretions involving hopeful  starlets and unsuspecting co-eds during his college tours of the 1960s. His legendary  personal feud with his mentor, Ham Fisher, the creator of Joe Palooka, also serves as  one of the book’s most compelling narratives. Their infamous quarrel receives what  is probably its definitive even-handed treatment as the biographers collate vast and  disparate accounts from both sides of the grudge. Few rivalries have been so bitterly  fought, tarnishing both artists’ professional credibility, and eventually contributing to  Fisher’s disgrace and suicide. At the same time, readers will enjoy more amusing  anecdotes relating to Capp’s gregarious mock “feuds” with other cartooning legends,  including his long-time friends Milton Caniff, Will Eisner, and Charles Schulz. All  told, Schumacher and Kitchen portray a deeply troubled, but equally charismatic per- sonality whose embattled life was every bit as acerbic and outrageous as the hillbilly  satire that made him both wealthy and notorious.   As sensational as Capp’s own story seems, Schumacher and Kitchen stick  close to what matters: the powerful appeal of Capp’s humor and the massive influ- ence of Li’l Abner and its yokel-driven backwoods humor. The kooky lingo and folk- sy appeal of Dogpatch’s barefoot denizens spoke to mid-century Americans in deep- ly nostalgic and familiar ways. Self-appointed highbrow “longhairs” valued Capp’s  work for its sly assaults on the gullibility of the ignorant, uncivilized masses as well  as his provoking satires of controversial celebrities like Orson Welles, Margaret     </page> <page sequence="3"> 212  Book Reviews  Mitchell, Fredric Wertham, and Joan Baez. For the most part, however, Capp’s Ap- palachian Adonis, Li’l Abner, and the rest of the Yokum clan spoke of simple solid  reactions to the iniquity, inequality, idolatry, and inanity of the modern and postmod- ern. Down home Dogpatch traditions like the ribald revelry of Sadie Hawkins Day,  the blatantly misogynistic Lena Hyena contest, the always alluring Moonshine  McSwine, and long-suffering Daisy Mae’s perpetual pursuit of Abner himself were  steeped in nineteenth-century nostalgia for small towns, simpler times, and our una- bashed interest in, as Dinah Shore famously sang during the hillbilly boom, “doin’  what comes naturally.” Capp’s capable army of journeyman assistants included ven- erable names like Moe Leff, Walter Johnston, Andy Amato, Harvey Curtis, Raeburn  Van Buren, as well as the great Frank Frazetta, and they all flooded his farce with  vicious wit, broad slapstick, and generous dollops of sultry cheesecake that objecti- fied and lampooned male and female bodies alike. At the same time, Capp’s Li’l Ab- ner could turn wildly surreal in its allegories and offshoots, and Schumacher and  Kitchen do fine justice to Capp’s commercial windfall involving the rise of the lova- ble Schmoo fad, as well as lesser anthropomorphic antics involving Kigmies,  Nogoodniks, and Bald Iggles.  Mammoth biographies of legendary cartoonists have been gaining ground in  recent years, and colossal works like R.C. Harvey’s 952-page Meanwhile: A Biog- raphy of Milton Caniff (2007) or David Michaelis’s 704-page Schulz and Peanuts: A  Biography (2008) have met up with other studies like Thomas Andrae’s Walt Kelly:  The Life and Art of the Creator of Pogo (2012) or Michael Tisserand’s forthcoming  biography of Krazy Kat creator George Herriman. Yet, Schumacher and Kitchen es- chew the editorial digressions, theoretical analyses, and capsule lessons in cultural  history that limit these pithy, but lumbering tomes. More importantly, Schumacher  and Kitchen do not attempt any posthumous psychological or sociocultural profiling  of their cantankerous subject beyond what clear, firm evidence—culled largely from  Capp’s own writings – can tell. The result is a focused, unambiguous, and generally  objective account of how Alfred Caplin, the oldest son of a struggling entrepreneur,  would eventually become one of the most creatively and commercially successful  cartoonists of the twentieth century.   Driven by a lifelong need to prove himself more successful, popular, and  powerful than “the other guy,” some of Capp’s antics are truly amusing, as when he  fools a plethora of art schools into giving him free courses, or when he and a friend  famously hitchhike across rural America, a lark that Schumacher and Kitchen say  sparked Capp’s early interest in hillbillies and hobos. Others are downright deplora- ble, especially his assault on John Lennon and Yoko Ono on the very day they rec- orded “Give Peace a Chance.” Thus, for all of Schumacher and Kitchen’s distance  and detachment, it remains difficult to see Capp’s life of belligerence and ballyhoo as  little more than a rake’s progress from a youthful delinquent to an influential bully,  braggart, and hypocrite.
