<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT STUDIES IN NEO-ARAMAIC DIALECTS1 BY RUDOLF MACUCH Since the beginnings of Neo-Aramaic studies in the second half of the last century, with the work of pioneers such as Stoddard (1855), Sachau (1865) and N6ldeke (1868) in East-Neo-Syriac, Prym and Socin (1883) in West-Neo-Syriac (Tur 'Abdin) and Parisot (1898-9) in West-Aramaic of Ma'lula and related dialects,2 research in the field of Neo-Aramaic dialectology has never known such an intensive upsurge as there has been in the second half of this century. Although harsh religious persecution by the Muslims and other unendurable hardships, particularly in this century, exterminated a large proportion of the speakers of these dialects or drove them from their original sites to Russia, America, various European countries and even Australia, where their idioms are likely to die within the next few generations, the interest in their more or less modest remnants is increasing. It is as if Aramaists had finally responded to an earnest last-moment appeal and understood the need to save this linguistic heritage before it disappears totally. However, it is symptomatic that re- searchers trying to record a dying dialect in situ (Krotkoff, Aradhin in Iraqi Kurdistan 1959, published 1982; Jastrow, Hertevin in East Turkey 1970, published 1988) were unable to find more than a single reliable informant on the dialects of the villages of their respective research. In dealing with Aramaic we have to do with a language which has a history of approximately three thousand years. In its most ancient form, the Old Aramaic (OA) inscriptions from Zenjirli and Sfire, it still represents a curious mixture of Canaanisms and Aramaisms. In its subsequent form, known as Reichsaramaisch (RA) 'Imperial Aramaic', which became a diplomatic lan- guage of the Achaemenid empire, the Canaanisms decreased but many Canaanite scribal practices were retained. The artificial unity of this lingua franca of the ancient Near East, in which dialectal differences were amalgamated, was preserved until the eruption of national Jewish and Christian Aramaic dialects, which in their new literary forms became important bearers of their respective religious, national and even supranational cultures.3 A fatal blow was dealt to these national Aramaic languages by the Islamic conquest. Although the main Aramaic cultural language, classical Syriac, still continued to be cultivated for centuries, and even now there are some enthusiastic efforts to revive it,4 everyday speech had deviated from it from its beginnings, and the rupture between the language of the Church and the spoken language became greater and greater over the centuries. The spoken language was completely saturated by the neighbouring tongues, Kurdish and Turkish, and (mostly through their intermediaries) by the languages of higher culture, Arabic and Persian. Since Aramaic was open to foreign influences from the beginning (cf. Marginal notes to Otto Jastrow, Der neuaramdische Dialekt von Hertevin (Provinz Siirt) (Semitica Viva, 3), xxv, 234 pp. (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1988), and Yona Sabar, The Book of Exodus in Neo-Aramaic in the dialect of the Jewish community of Zakho: including selected texts in other Neo-Aramaic dialects and a glossary (Publications of the Hebrew University Language Traditions Project, 12), iii, 181 pp. (Jerusalem, 1988) [in Hebrew with an English abstract]. 2 See my bibliography in R.

However, despite the overwhelming lexical influence, it is difficult to explain how spoken Syro-Aramaic came to develop a peculiar verbal morphology with a threefold system of tenses which is found neither in classical Syriac nor in any other Aramaic dialect or Semitic language and could hardly be based exclusively on the straightforward influence of neighbouring tongues. Whereas the speakers of Ma'lula, Bax'a and Jubb 'Adin retained the classical perfect and imperfect, and Mandaeans simply replaced the latter by the participial present- future, the Syro-Aramaeans were not content with either their simple classical forms or with further simplification of them; they sought instead to extend them, in the interests of more exact temporal and modal expression. This typical feature of Neo-Syriac verbal morphology, consisting in the formation of threefold sets of tenses from original Aramaic resources such as active and passive participles, infinitives, particles, pronominal affixes and suffixes, is mainly due to the inner development of the language. Although its modalities have no parallel in other Semitic languages and may to some extent remind us of the more developed Indo-European tense systems, it is hardly possible to explain this phenomenon satisfactorily in terms of the influence of any neighbouring non-Semitic language. The change of verbal structure according to foreign patterns is not so straightforward as the simple borrowing of words, or even the construction of new verbal roots from such loanwords. Since Neo-Aramaic dialects are known to us only in their latest phases, we are hardly in a position to make exact diachronical observations on this intriguing feature of their linguistic development. Its starting point seems to have been the classical use of the active participle + personal affixes, and the active use of the passive participle + enclitic 1 + personal suffixes. Only the typical Neo-Syriac conjugation: infinitive with the auxiliary verb HWY, may have developed under the influence of Iranian languages, in which numerous verbal expressions are formed from verbal nouns (even Arabic masdars) + budan 'to be', kardan 'to do ',,5 etc. Similarly, the passive participle with the auxiliary verb PUS corresponds exactly to the Persian passive voice with sudan 'to become '. Nevertheless, although this parallelism is not devoid of linguistic interest, it constitutes no cogent argument for Iranian influence on Neo-Syriac verbal morphology. The threefold system of tenses is firmly rooted in all East Neo-Syriac dialects and may be of quite early date, although there are no ancient sources to prove it (see below). As to the synchronic study of Neo-Aramaic dialects, it is gratifying that scholars have started to pay profound attention to this important field of linguistic research. Although through the persecution of Christians in Turkey during the First World War and the ensuing 'Assyrian tragedy ,6 many homelands of Syriac-speaking Christians were completely abandoned and much valuable linguistic material perished, there is still a good deal to be saved. After 5 Mar Toma Audo, in the preface of his Grdm.dtiq d-lisdna swdddya' Grammar of the vernacular language' (Urmi, 1905) already criticized the exaggerated misuse of this verb following Persian and Turkish patterns in the dialect of Urmi; shortened German translation in R. Macuch, Geschichte der spdt- und neusyrischen Literatur (1976), 87. 6 According to the title of a book of Yusuf Malek; cf. also P. Rondot, Les Chretiens d'Orient, 152 if.; R.

In Georgia, where Assyrian immigrants from the time of the First World War still live in close rural communities, K. G. Tsereteli managed to record texts in the dialects of Urmi, Salmas, Van, Jilu and Tiari. It is greatly to be regretted that he was able to publish only the first volume, in the best known dialect of Urmi,7 and that his planned series, Materials on Aramaic dialectology, had to be discontinued for financial reasons. It would be a boon to scholarship if either he or his students could resume the publication of these texts. They would be especially useful for the last three dialects mentioned, of which we know very little. Similarly minimal is our knowledge of the dialects of former Nestorian districts of Diz and Baz, Tiari and Txuma, Walto and Jilu,8 although some of their old survivors and their descendants-after their flight from Iraq 1934-36 9-still live in village clusters on both sides of the river Khabur (north- east Syria). Less reliable for dialectal studies, perhaps, are informants from the larger eastern and western urban centres, since the old speakers of the dialects have almost completely died out, and cultural associations, churches, clubs, etc. are not able to, and for the most part, are not even interested in preserving the dialects, which are seen as a means of dividing the nation. Dialects undermine the idea of national Assyrian unity, more so than the confessions into which this small nation is split. The propagators of the so- called Assyro-Chaldean Union are also linguistic purists. In their press in Tehran they have succeeded not only in eliminating the minimal differences between the former Nestorian-Protestant and the Chaldean-Catholic press in Urmi but also in purging the language of superfluous Turkish and Kurdish words, which no longer have a sense in their new milieu, and have replacd them with original Syriac words. Their example is followed by the 'Assyrians' the world over. This is certainly justifiable, but would hardly have been possible in their original homelands, where Turkish and Kurdish loanwords meant more to them than the original Syriac vocabulary, the meaning of which they no longer understood. Given this recent development of Neo-Syriac outside its original homeland, ' Assyrian' immigrants in urban centres of the old and new world can perhaps teach us a new sort of modern Syriac which represents a considerable rupture with its spontaneously developed historical dialects. A more reliable source for dialectological research may be the Neo-Syriac-speaking Jewish immigrants in Israel. They have no ' national Assyrian' ideal and therefore, have developed no purist tendency, and their occasional use of Hebrew words in their written Bible translations as well as in daily speech is easily recognizable. Because of their close community life and the closer contacts they had with neighbouring Jewish communities than with their Christian neighbours, they have developed many peculiar dialectal phenomena, so that their dialects require special studies.10 7 Konstantin Ceretali, Materialy po aramejskoj dialektologii, Tom I.

Only on the dialect of Txuma, is there published work, a monograph, by Heidi Jacobi, Grammatik des thumischen Neuaramdisch (Nordostsyrien) (Wiesbaden, 1973). Texts in this dialect were recorded in the seventies in Hassake (Syria) by Gabriele Yonan; it is to be hoped they will be published. 9 R. Macuch, Geschichte, 275. 10 cf. an interesting observation by Yona Sabar (Neo-Aramaic Newsletter, 3, 1987, 20): ' All of the Jewish families [of both the Christian and the Moslem sections of the village of 'Aradin] were in close contact with the Jews of 'Amadiya ... Interestingly, the Neo-Aramaic dialect of the one Jewish family from the Christian 'Aradin ... is quite different from that of the Jews of the Moslem' Aradin, and from that of the Christians as described in Krotkoffs book.' Similarly, Simon Hopkins (ibid., 9 f.): ' In most (all?) cases where Jews and Christians lived together in the same town/village 216</page><page sequence="4">RECENT STUDIES IN NEO-ARAMAIC DIALECTS For as long as the first generation of immigrants speaking these dialects still lives in Israel, they will facilitate research in this extremely attractive field of scholarship. This necessarily brief outline of the present state of the Neo-Aramaic dialects perhaps already shows that research in this field is laden with a multitude of problems. In order to cope with them, Neo-Aramaists have organized special panels at the meetings of the Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA), and since 1984, Professor O. Jastrow annually distributes a Neo-Aramaic Newsletter, in which researchers in this specialist field inform a limited circle of interested readers of current research projects, their progress and achievements, and also elaborate their observations on related problems emerging in the course of their research. In spite of its restricted circulation, conditioned by the highly specific nature of the subject, this 'Newsletter' has proved to be a very useful working tool. The five issues distributed so far have kept us in touch with the 15-20 Neo-Aramaists working more or less consistently in the field covering the whole area of spoken Aramaic. Among the most productive of Neo-Aramaic scholars are Otto Jastrow (University of Erlangen-Niirnberg) and Yona Sabar (University of California, Los Angeles), whose recent publications are the subject of this review. Jastrow, who already in the middle sixties assisted Helmut Ritter in the prestigious edition of his .Turoyo, Die Volkssprache der syrischen Christen des Tuir 'AbdTn, (Beirut, 1967-69), and whose dissertation Laut- und Formenlehre des neuaramdischen Dialekts von Midin im Tur 'Abdin (Bamberg, 1967) has in the meantime gone into its third edition (Wiesbaden, 1985), has dedicated his scholarly life predominantly to field research in Aramaic and Arabic dialects. Besides his editorship of the Neo-Aramaic Newsletter, he edits another import- ant series, Semitica Viva (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz), in which in 1987 a book on the Arabic dialectology of North Yemen by P. Behnstedt, and Edward Odisho, The sound system of Modern Assyrian (Neo-Aramaic) and in 1988 his own book, Der neuaramiiische Dialekt von Hertevin, have appeared. In 1989 he launched a parallel series of propaedeutic works on living Semitic languages, Semitica Viva-Series Didactica, in which the first volume published was a teaching course on the only surviving West Aramaic dialects, those of Ma'liula, Bax'a and Jubb 'Adin, prepared by his former student, Werner Arnold, who spent almost two years in Ma'luila and recorded some 80 hours of the three dialects mentioned, which material is being prepared for publication, with a compara- tive grammar and glossary of each, in five subsequent volumes of Semitica Viva. Jastrow's discovery of a genuine East Syriac dialect north-west of Hakkari, a region which the Nestorians were forced to evacuate in 1915, is an extremely fortunate event in Neo-Aramaic studies. Although he succeeded in discovering as well some remains of another dialect, Mlahs6, still further north-west (see his map of Neo-Aramaic dialects in Turkey, Der neuaramiiische Dialekt von Hertevin, hereafter NDH, p. xix), which he plans to present in a future publication-in Hertevin (old Turkish: Hertevinler, modern Turkish Ekindiizii) and both spoke Neo-Aramaic, their dialects differed to a greater or lesser degree. In the west, e.g. in Zaxo, these differences seem to have been fairly small... Confessional differences of a more significant nature occurred a little further east in Aradhin, where the few Jews of the village spoke a dialect by no means identical with the Christian speech described by G. Krotkoff (personal communication from Y. Sabar). When we reach Iran the cleavage becomes so deep that mutual intelligibility is seriously impaired.' Hopkins even proposed considering a reclassification of Neo- Syriac dialects according to the use of the preterite zil' he went' of southern dialects as opposed to zille of the northern dialects of Iranian Azerbaijan. Curiously enough, in Sanandaj the Jews speak a zil- and the Christians a zille-dialect. The proposal is worth consideration, since this use 'is accompanied by a whole array of additional phenomena distinguishing the two groups of speakers.' 217</page><page sequence="5">RUDOLF MACUCH he discovered an intact East Aramaic dialect which may have preserved some original phonological and morphological traits of spoken East Syriac from the period before the expulsion of the 'Assyrians' from adjacent regions. This dialect is extremely rich in original Aramaic agricultural expressions. More than half the texts (pp. 108-40) are taken from agriculture and rural life, and only the second half (pp. 141-75) consists of popular (mostly biblical) legends. The detailed grammatical sketch of the dialect extends to almost half the book (pp. 1-105) and is based not just on the published texts but also on other direct information. It is as complete as can be expected from the data of a single informant. Nevertheless, it is a pity that the author deliberately avoided 'all theoretical and descriptive ballast and even cross-references of a diachronic and comparative sort as regards to other dialects' (NDH, p. xxi). This decision impairs the glossary, especially where no etymological, or at least comparative, indications are given. Since the texts are published in parallel with translation, there is no particular value in a glossary which adds nothing to that already given in the translation. While I would not go so far as E. Lipiniski in his review of R. Macuch and E. Panoussi, Neusyrische Chrestomathie," who claimed that a glossary should pursue absolutely the ultimate origin of loanwords-a glossary is certainly not the appropriate place for a comparative Semitic dictionary- Lipiniski's observation nevertheless shows that reviewers perhaps still expect something more from glossaries, even if it is just the indispensable comparative minimum. Jastrow's conviction that etymological and comparative suggestions should no longer be included in monographs on Neo-Aramaic dialects is premature. His notion that Neo-Aramaic research may already have advanced so far that historical and comparative data need to be reserved for a separate kind of publication (NDH, p. xxii) would mean the undesirable postponement of a very urgent task. Jastrow succeeds in giving a detailed grammatical sketch of this dialect and brings to light not only a great many phenomena typical for this particular dialect but also general Aramaic features, comparable with features in other ancient and modern, as well as neighbouring and distant dialects, which prove the genuine Aramaic character of Jastrow's dialect. In phonology 12 some interesting combinatory phenomena are mentioned in the interests of a precise and complete phonetic account, although-because of their lack of phonemic significance-they were disregarded in transcription, as in the traditional etymological Syriac script in literary dialects (Urmi and Alqosh). For example, the tendency of k and g to slight palatalization at the beginning of syllables is widespread in all North Syriac dialects, as the author rightly points out (1.1.2., p. 4). But its constant designation would unnecessarily overload the transcription and sometimes also destroy the etymological image of the word.'3 Another general Aramaic phenomenon, the spirantization of begadkefat, often differs from dialect to dialect. It is, therefore, not surprising that in 11 Bibliotheca Orientalis, xxxiv, 1977, col. 100. 12 In the table of the consonantal system (p. 3) there are some minor inconsistencies, although according to the point of articulation all consonants are properly classified. The voiced occlusives b, d, g are indicated unsatisfactorily as ' affricates ', although in 1.2.5 (p. 8) only c and g are correctly treated as' affricates '. In the series of fricatives, z and z (as well as of two laryngeals in brackets) the indication 'voiced' has been omitted, although no specific new technical term was invented for them. Similarly, the emphatics, t and s, are included without indication of their specific phonetic character. 13 This strange phonetic phenomenon owed to foreign influence was already known to Noldeke (ZDMG, 36, 1882, 670). But as it is merely combinatory, earlier dialectologists already neglected to indicate it, and naturally it could not be indicated in dictionaries in Syriac script (Maclean, etc.,), see my remark in OLZ, 57, 1962, col. 119, n. 1. 218</page><page sequence="6">RECENT STUDIES IN NEO-ARAMAIC DIALECTS Hertevin only b is distinctly spirantized (1.2.1., p. 5), although initial p, t, k. at the beginning of words and syllables is still regularly aspirated, but as non- phonemic, not indicated in transcription (1.1.1., p. 4). Otherwise, a distinctf occurs only in loanwords, e.g. ferna 'oven'; plan (p. 5) need not be considered as an exception, since it can be explained as an original Syriac word,14 which need not necessarily have been borrowed from Arabic f(u)ldn. The spirantization of t and d was completely neglected in Hertevin. although it was fully preserved in Aradhin and partly also in certain other dialects, some of which even extended the development of spirantized dentals to fricatives, s and z, which-insofar as these dialects were written-was also expressed graphically (see numerous examples in Y. Sabar's book under review; cf. also the Christian dialect of Sanandaj in Macuch and Panoussi, op. cit., p. 39 [206]: ksdwa &lt; *ktaba); some dialects even changed these to the lateral 1 (numerous examples in Irene Garbell, The Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect of Persian Azer- baijan (The Hague, 1965), esp. p. 48, where even the abstract ending -ata became -ula). Similarly surprising is the transition of the spirant k (x) &gt; h. so that x remains only in Arabic and Kurdish loanwords: and even an original Arabic g may be changed to x (e.g. xarTb &lt; Arab. garFb 'foreign', p. 6). Unspirantized consonants are either (rarely) replaced by a glottal stop or (more frequently) fully syncopated. This phenomenon. common to all Neo-Syriac dialects, is obviously more comprehensively represented in original Syriac script. where the syncopated letters are still etymologically written and provided with a linea occultans, than in a phonetic transcription where they must be omitted. A peculiar phenomenon common to all Neo-Aramaic dialects is the affricates, c and g, which are owed to foreign (Persian, Kurdish, Turkish, Arabic) influence. In original Syriac 15 and Mandaic 16 scripts they require diacritical signs on letters phonetically close to them. In Hertevin these foreign sound also influenced original Aramaic words containing the groups ty and dy: acca (&lt; *atya)' she comes ', mecca (&lt; *metya [ &lt; *maytya])' she brings ', eggu (&lt; *edya[m]) 'today ', as well as the forms of the verb nsq &gt; ncq/y 'to kiss' (1.2.5., p. 8). It may be added that probably the first and. in literary Neo-Syriac and in Mandaic, only original Semitic word containing the affricated c: ecca ' nine' (&lt; *tsa'),17 including its extended forms in' nineteen' and ' ninety ', are attested also in Hertevin (pp. 99 f.). It would lead too far afield to compare this secondary consonant with the Ma'liila dialect, where c replaces, even in verbal conjugation, the original Aramaic t (partly in the afformatives of the perfect and totally in the preformatives of the imperfect)-a phenomenon which requires further diachronic investigation. As to the vowels, consistent indication of their length would have been preferable to the general statement about their distribution which does not make their length or shortness absolutely predictable (' obgleich das Auftreten der Lang- bzw. Kurz-vokale deshalb nicht immer voraussagbar ist ' Jastrow, 1.4., p. 10). The fact that there are no minimal pairs to prove phonemic opposition between long and short vowels is poor consolation to a reader seeking complete phonetic information on the language, and to whom phonemic implications may be a cura posterior. There is confusion among Neo-Aramaists as to the transcription of classical proclitic particles since these are written, in the classical as well as in modern 14 Brockelmann, Lexicon Syriacum, 575a. 15 See R. Macuch and E. Panoussi, Neusyrische Chrestomathie, p. xxv (nos. 4 and 13). 16 See R. Macuch, Handbook of Classical and Modern Mandaic (HCMM), 12 (s serving for c, g and z). 17 R.

PART 2 16 219</page><page sequence="7">RUDOLF MACUCH literary languages, with the following noun to which they syntagmatically belong, whereas, as a rule, they are pronounced enclitically with the preceding noun.'8 Although I. Garbell'9 already clearly noted genitive relations as bratit (sultana) '(the king's) daughter', ktabid (b-idew) 'the book that [was] in his hand' etc., Krotkoff was still disconnecting the genitive particle d from the preceding noun and connecting it with the following by means of a hyphen. Although this may correspond better to the written form of the language, it does not do justice to the phonetic realities of spoken dialects. Jastrow (2.4., p. 25) rightly noted sused bahr 'Pferd des Meeres', or even with total regressive assimilation to the first consonant of the following noun, suseb bahr id., qdales susa' der Hals des Pferdes' etc. Nevertheless, he preferred to transcribe: xallahi d Messer 'die Hungersnot von Agypten' (Jastrow, l.c.), ha 'aha d 'etlan 'ein Bruder, den wir haben ' (p. 31), etc., although a consonant separated from both the preceding and the following word is not at all phonetically realizable. Y. Sabar's texts of the Jewish translation of the Pentateuch prove that the Jews, who could have had no historico-orthographical prejudices, regularly connec- ted this particle with the preceding word, with which alone it can be properly pronounced. Similarly interesting are morphology and vocabulary, which show many phenomena comparable with numerous other ancient and modern Aramaic dialects. Curiously enough, some of them correspond even to peculiar Talmudic and Neo-Mandaic (=NM) 20 forms; cf. possessive particle did- (with personal suff.), amennoh 'I say to you' with NM amenni 'I say to him' (and similar Talmudic forms), although classical Mandaic used them slightly differently. Most surprising is the use of typical Kurdish isoglosses, such as xezmat 'service', sue (=Iraqi NM sog) 'fault', although South-Mesopotamian ter- ritory is quite distant from the Kurdish area.2' Periphrastic conjugations: hwele magbor ' he was forced ', wedle heggom ' he attacked ', etc. (3.6., pp. 44 f.) are rightly compared with their Turkish and Kurdish models. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that they correspond exactly to Persian magbiir buid, huguiim kard, etc. (taken directly over to NM magbuir tdmmi, huguim ebad, etc.). This kind of periphrastic conjugation extended from Turkey to South Iran and it would be difficult to establish its exact origin, although it seems to be Iranian rather than Turkish. Not only is it spread through both Iranian languages, Persian and Kurdish but moreover the western dialects of Neo-Aramaic, Ma'luila and Tur6yo, which were more closely in contact with the Turkish language and culture, were not subjected to its influence as were the Iranian Aramaeans in Kurdistan, Azerbaijan, and even in the most distant southern province, Khuzistan. Professor Jastrow offers us in his book much more than can be discussed in a review article. His detailed description of a fortunately discovered remnant of the most western branch of East Aramaic in a geographically remote part of East Turkey from which the Christian Aramaeans were driven out by force sixty-five years ago may still give us some approximate insight into the linguistic structure of these dialects, which for the most part died out with their expelled 18 cf. phonetic transcription in Macuch and Panoussi, op. cit., pp. xx b f. 19 The Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect of Persian Azerbaijan, op. cit., 2.12.21, pp. 54 f. 20These may now be comfortably compared with my grammatical sketch and glossary in R. Macuch, Neumanddische Chrestomathie mit Einfiihrung, grammatischer Skizze, kommentierter Ubersetzung und Glossar (Porta Linguarum Orientalium, xvIII, 1989). 21 In this connexion, it is still more surprising that the Mandaeans use the Kurdish particle of totality gi/es- 'all, whole, complete' (Macuch, Neumanddische Chrestomathie, glossary, 210) unknown in northern Neo-Aramaic dialects, cf.

Jastrow's monograph on the Neo-Aramaic dialect of Hertevin will, therefore, retain its value for comparative Neo-Aramaic linguistics. Yona Sabar's publication of a Neo-Aramaic targum of the book of Exodus in the Jewish Neo-Syriac dialect of Zakho with comparisons of selected texts in other dialects, 'Amidiya, 'Arodhin, Dehok, the Christians of Urmia (in both Hebrew script and phonetic transcription), and Jews of Urmia, is a continu- ation of an extremely important project, namely, the publication of the whole Pentateuch in Jewish Neo-Syriac. The book of Genesis was published previously (1983) in the same series, dedicated to (Jewish) language tradition and edited by S. Morag.22 The importance of Jewish Neo-Aramaic was mentioned above; it remains only to point out the significance of modern translations of one of the most basic works of world literature, the Pentateuch, into these dialects. Besides their self-evident hermeneutic interest (as a rule, uninteresting to linguists) they have the obvious advantage of presenting the same extended text in different dialects and furthering their comparative study in a way that is hardly possible with any other kind of text. The more literal the translation,' a word-for-word reflection of the Hebrew text' (Sabar, p. iii), the more it can be useful for comparative dialectal studies. Naturally, all parts of the Pentateuch are not necessarily of equal linguistic value. The high standard of simplicity reached by the narrative-legendary book of Genesis is without parallel in any later book. In Exodus this style is sustained only in chapters 1-20, the only narrative section of the book. Chapters 21-24, concerned with legislation, are already more difficult to translate into simple popular speech, and chapters 25-40, concerning the construction and decora- tion of the Tabernacle, and full of specific technical terms unknown in popular speech, must have been a very difficult task for a simple translator with no special technical or linguistic knowledge. The difficulties are perhaps greater still in the highly technical Book of Leviticus. Exodus, chapters 1, 21, 40, with which the three stylistically different sections of the book begin, are presented in the six dialects mentioned in appendices 1-6, and a comparative list of selected vocabulary from these dialects is given in appendix 7. A simple glance at this list reveals that there are greater similarities between distant Jewish dialects than between the Jewish and Christian speech in the one city of Urmi, which show some unexpected differences. E.g. Hebr. preposition 'et 'with' = Z(axo) 'immid23 = 'Ar(odhin) minnid = 'Am(idya) d'lid = D(ehok) ale(y)t, U(rmi) Jew. gal = U Chr. 'am; Hebr. ubeto 'and his house' = Z ubese = 'Am-Ar-D ubete(h) = U Jew. be(y)leb (!) = U Chr. baytu(hy), etc. Similarly surprising dialectal differences could come to light if we had comparative glossaries for all places where Aramaic-speaking Jews and Christians are living side by side. Hebrew script with additional diacritical signs for foreign Arabic and Iranian sounds: g, z, c and z (/d) placed on gimel, zayin and sadeh respectively, supplies adequate means for the phonetic transcription of Neo-Aramaic. The dagesh in the letters begadkefat designates hard pronunciation; as a conse- quence its omission in these letters suffices also to designate Ar. interdentals (t 22 It is worth mentioning that the editor dedicated the first volume of the series, The Hebrew language tradition of the Baghdadi community (1977), to the memory of an outstanding linguist and dialectologist, Irene Garbell (1901-66), who shortly before her death crowned her research with a standard work, The Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect of Persian Azerbaijan, cited above. 23 The following forms are simple transliterations of the vocalized words in Hebrew script without aiming at exact and detailed phonetic transcription. 221</page><page sequence="9">RUDOLF MACUCH and d) and fricative velars (x and g, although the latter is indicated in Ar. loanwords superfluously by a diacritical vertical stroke on gimel). In all other letters, the dagesh indicates the reduplication of the sound (Ar. shaddah). A shwa is always a shwa quiescens. These rules, applied already in the edition of Genesis, are valid for the whole edition. Sabar's edition is preceded by an introduction in seven chapters in which some particular linguistic and hermeneutic features of the translation are discussed: (1) a general comparison of various regional Jewish translations and the Christian one of Urmi(a); (2) digressive translations of obscure passages of the Hebrew text based on Targum Onkelos, Rashi, or apparent local interpretations; (3) euphemism and avoidance of anthropomorphism and anthropopathism; (4) morphological digressions in the translation of nouns (collective nouns by the plural and vice versa); (5) morphological digressions in the translation of verbs (Hebrew passive voice by active); (6) digressive translations of some prepositions; (7) borrowed Hebrew elements. This introduction deserved a longer English abstract or a complete English render- ing; it should certainly not have been reduced to one page of English text. Sabar's book concludes with a very useful etymological glossary of all words in all the dialects in the texts and in the apparatus. It would of course have been preferable and more practical to have had a complete glossary of the whole Pentateuch in one volume rather than five separate glossaries to its single books. But who is prepared to wait until the prestigious edition of the Jewish Neo- Syriac translation(s) of the Pentateuch is complete? Unfortunately, as far as the arrangement of glossaries to Neo-Aramaic dialects is concerned, there is no unity among Aramaists. Most prefer the sequence of the Latin alphabet and arbitrary additions of subsidiary letters either to the approximate sounds of this alphabet or-still less conveniently-to the end of the glossary (t, w, x, y, z, z'). Moreover, not content with thereby making comparison with good ancient and modern dictionaries of Aramaic in original script more difficult-they go further still and impose subdivisions on their glossaries according to the parts of speech: I. Garbell (1965) gave three glossaries: (1) Verbal root-morphemes; (2) Irregular and ambiguous verbal stems; (3) Free and bound lexemes. Krotkoff (1982) also gave three (List of proper names and nicknames, Glossary, and List of roots). Jastrow (1988) gives only two (Allgemeines Glossar, and Verbalglossar). Even this latter twofold subdivision is hardly justifiable. A separation of verbal roots from other words obviously does not facilitate the use of a glossary but complicates it to no end. Only Y. Sabar did not doubt that a single glossary of different Neo-Syriac dialects arranged according to the traditional Canaanite-Aramaic alphabet would completely satisfy, and that verbal roots ought not to be excluded from the general glossary. Authors of classical Syriac dictionaries (Payne-Smith and Brockelmann) and even A. J. Maclean in his most complete dictionary of vernacular Syriac (1901!) never dared to make such undesirable innovations. Even in transcribing Aramaic texts and dictionaries into Latin script there is no justification for separating the verbs from other words. In E. S. Drower and R. Macuch, A Mandaic dictionary (1963), as well as in the exhaustive philologi- cal indexes to my HCMM (1965), in the glossary to Neusyrische Chrestomathie (1974), and that to my Neumanddische Chrestomathie (1989), I followed the traditional Aramaic alphabet and included verbal roots with other parts of speech, but set off by capital letters: no one has reproached me for this natural procedure, which from the standpoint of Semitic philology is the only one worth following. As an essential part of speech the verb ought not to be separated from the other parts. It is enough to indicate the root typographically, by 222</page><page sequence="10">RECENT STUDIES IN NEO-ARAMAIC DIALECTS capitals or bold type,24 or to hyphenate its radicals, in order to stress its primary importance, rather than to demote it to a sort of secondary addition to the 'general' glossary. In spite of all the research carried out on Neo-Aramaic dialects, their comparative grammar is still a remote project. Because of their heterogeneities, much more investigation of local dialects of Neo-East-Syriac is needed. Divergencies between them-almost from village to village, and even between the Christian and the Jewish inhabitants of the same city or village-make this task extremely difficult. Who would, under such conditions, dare to design an atlas of the phonetic phenomena of the Neo-Syriac area which, in spite of certain common basic elements and isoglosses, ought to be separated from West-Aramaic (Ma'lula-Bax'a-Jubb 'Adin) and from South-East-Aramaic (Mandaic). These extreme dialects will have to be excluded from the closed field of Neo-Syriac studies, to which they never properly belonged. A comparative glossary of all Neo-Aramaic dialects would similarly be of little practical use, although each single glossary of these dialectal groups ought necessarily to contain all the possible comparisons with other dialects. The compilation of a comparative dictionary of all Neo-Aramaic dialects which, as the crowning point of studies in Neo-Aramaic dialectology, will certainly have an intrinsic scholarly value, must necessarily wait until all dialects are lexicographically exhausted. For Christian dialectal Neo-Syriac, many more monographs like Jastrow's on Hertevin and, for the Jewish dialects at least, the completion of Sabar's edition of the Neo-Aramaic Pentateuch will be necessary before effective comparative studies of Neo-Aramaic dialectology may begin. As to West- Aramaic, let us hope that Arnold's records will prove as complete as possible. For South-East-Aramaic (Mandaic), let us hope that the situation of Khuzistan which, after the beginning of the Iraqi-Iranian war, provoked the pessimistic views I expressed in Neumanddische Chrestomathie (pp. 17 f.), is of an ephemeral nature, as a recent book by Salim Berenji [in Persian], Qawm(-e) az ydd rafteh 'A forgotten people [:the Mandaeans]' (Tehran, 1367 [hejri shamsi] (= 1988)), containing a primitive glossary and short Neo-Mandaic phraseology may indicate. The Neo-Mandaic stories the present writer collected in the last week of the year 1953 and published in Neumanddische Chrestomathie (1989), are the only texts in this dialect presented to a scholarly audience. May I express the hope that they will not be the last, and that further material in this sole South-East Aramaic dialect may still be saved. 24 See e.g. F. A. Pennacchietti's glossary in Testi Neo-Aramaici dell'Iran settentrionale raccolti da Enrico Cerulli con glossario di Fabrizio A. Pennacchietti (Napoli, 1971); in spite of his use of the Latin alphabet with its sequence of letters Pennacchietti did not exclude verbal roots from the general glossary but included them in bold type in square brackets at the head of each verbal entry. 223</page></plain_text>
