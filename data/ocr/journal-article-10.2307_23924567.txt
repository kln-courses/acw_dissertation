Jeanrond I. HERMENEUTICS AND THE QUESTION OF PRAXIS The history of philosophical hermeneutics since Schleiermacher can be read as a story of success. Understanding and explanation, the two principal dimensions of any act of critical interpretation, have been well examined. The hermeneutical circle and the necessity of initial prejudgements as to the overall meaning of the text have been analysed in depth. We know that our understanding of written and oral texts needs to be validated by a detailed analysis of the textual strategies, i.e. all the syntactical and semantic procedures which together produce the textuality of the text. We know also, especially since the Gadamer-Habermas-debate in the 1970s, that a critical interpretation theory must include a critique of ideologies in order to be able to detect hidden interests and systematic distortions possibly operative in the act of interpretation. We have seen the usefulness of comparing the hermeneutical activity with human conversation and there fore speak today of'the hemeneutical conversation between reader and text'. The result of this conversation we may call with Hans-Georg Gadamer 'the fusion of horizons', that is the fusion of the horizon of the reader with the horizon of the texts. We have been helped by Paul Ricoeur to acknowledge that any serious reading of literary or religious texts may result in challenging us to review our present mode of being in the world in the light of the mode of being in the world disclosed by the text in the act of reading. And we have been made aware by David Tracy that some texts are able to attract the reader's attention more than others. Such texts which have continued to provoke readers to review their existential self-understanding, Tracy has called 'classic texts'. Biblical texts are his primary example.2 As Christian theologians we are, of course, indebted to all these insights into interpretation theory since much of our work consists in acts of interpretation. Christian theology needs to search continuously for adequate theories of interpretation. Â© Oxford University Press 1988</page><page sequence="2">WERNER G. JEANROND 175 Christian faith has always had to face the tension between the claims of its tradition and the demands of new experiences made by Christians. On the one hand, the authority of traditional expressions of our faith may be accepted or rejected in view of a changing horizon. In any case, however, those expressions have succeeded at least in making us reconsider our own Christian existence. On the other hand, in the light of our contemporary experiences in this universe, a fresh appropriation of the Christian faith has become necessary. Given this characteristic of our faith, Christian theology needs to be particularly grateful to Paul Ricoeur for his proposal of a dual hermeneutical activity aiming at once at the retrieval of our tradition and at a critical assessment of it. Hermeneutics of retrieval must go hand in hand with hermeneutics of suspicion.3 Finally we must be thankful for modern hermeneutics because of its recognition of the need for a community of interpreters in which the pluralism of interpretations can unfold its enriching nature. The recognition of this pluralism has already had an impact on the understanding of the Christian church as a community of interpreters and has allowed us theologians to demand a reorganization of the authority structures in the church so as to give space to the new spirit of public and pluralistic interpretation. It would appear that now all of our horizons are respected as conversation partners with the expressions of our past. Thus, hermeneutical reflection seems to have helped us to realize our emancipation as accountable and responsible interpreters of our own tradition. If this was so there would indeed be enough reason for theologians to celebrate the achievement of modern hermeneutics. However, there are guests at the party who think that the celebration of the achievement of modern hermeneutics is premature. They claim that modern hermeneutics has been predominantly concerned with communica tive theory about individuals and texts without proper regard to such disturbing dimensions of human existence as the suffering of the poor, the marginalization of women, the exploitation of nature, the threat of a nuclear holocaust.4 The most critical disturbance of the hermeneutical feast, how ever, consists in the claim that modern hermeneutics has led modern theology to reduce its hermeneutical problem to a mere consideration of the relationship between systematic and historical theology, i.e. between dogma and history.5 Over against this reduction Johann B. Metz demands a new hermeneutics whose primary concern is to be the relationship between theory and praxis, i.e. between the understanding of Christian faith and social praxis.6 This new hermeneutics, 'a hermeneutics of Christian praxis',7 it has been argued, would give more appropriate attention to praxis as the</page><page sequence="3">176 HERMENEUTICS AND CHRISTIAN PRAXIS very basis of theological discourse and not only as its aim.8 Christian praxis is discipleship which needs theory, but only a theory which is dialectically related to Christian praxis. Any split between theory and praxis would allow theology to act as master over the Christian subjects thus reduced to servants.9 Theologians such as Metz, Lamb, Sobrino, the Boffs, Segundo, Lane and many more feminist and liberation theologians share a different reading of the career of modern hermeneutics.10 In spite of all its cognitive merits, modern hermeneutics is being blamed for its fall into idealism and its subsequent neglect of the ethical-political dimension of every act of interpretation. In order to put this debate on modern hermeneutics and Christian praxis into a wider context and to clarify further both concepts 'interpretation' and 'praxis', I would like to examine the history of Christian hermeneutics with the following questions in mind: What has 'Christian praxis' meant in various periods of the history of the Christian movement? How did Christian hermeneutics relate to Christian praxis? How did Christian hermeneutics respond to the challenge of new experiences in different contexts of Christian history? I shall first examine the beginnings of Christian hermeneutics and the function of the allegorical method in bridging the hermeneutical gap between tradition and new praxis. Secondly, I shall try to reassess the importance of Augustine's hermeneutics. And finally, I shall return to modern hermeneutics and offer some conclusions and proposals towards a more adequate understanding of the relationship between hermeneutics and Christian praxis. 2. THE BEGINNINGS OF CHRISTIAN HERMENEUTICS Until the 18th century, the development of hermeneutics, the theory of interpretation, in Western culture was chiefly promoted by the Jewish Christian search for models of adequate interpretation of their Scriptures. The belief in the divine inspiration of certain texts and the need to disclose God's will believed to be contained in such texts led to the development of hermeneutics as a necessary theological activity. Without proper hermeneu tics Christian life is in danger of losing touch with its primary orientation, namely God's self-disclosure as witnessed to by the different expressions of the Jewish-Christian tradition.11 In their search for adequate models of interpretation, both Jewish and Christian thinkers learned from the way in which certain literary texts functioned in Greece. Greek literary criticism arose from the need to interpret Homer's works in a society which had accepted the Iliad and Odyssey as foundational texts. These texts informed the value system of the</page><page sequence="4">WERNER G. JEANROND 177 public and private life, especially the aims and praxis of education. Hence, the adequate interpretation of these texts was a matter of public interest and political necessity.12 The requirements of instructing the young in reading, understanding and imitating these foundational literary texts led to the development of grammar and text criticism as well as to deeper insights into the process of literary communication (cf. Aristotle's Poetics). The beginnings of both grammatical exegesis and allegorical interpretation can be traced back to Homeric criticism. Thus, in Greek culture the Jewish-Christian movements encountered not only a sophisticated philosophical tradition which presented a challenge to their theological thinking, but also a welcome help in their search for models of text interpretation. Accepting the Greek models meant, however, also participating in the discussion of the implications of these models. The crucial problem to be solved was whether the text speaks for itself once the reader begins to disclose the meaning of the text's parts or requires a key from outside itself in order to unlock its otherwise mysterious images and meanings. The allegorical method of interpretation affirmed the necessity of an extra-textual key while grammatical exegesis tried to work from within the text by studying its linguistic devices and connections. However, both methods, often applied simultaneously, acknowledged the principal gap which exists between the text and the reader and which is to be bridged in the act of interpretation. Allegorical exegesis had one point in its favour, namely its ability to interpret as symbolical all those passages in the texts which, if taken literally, would violate the moral norms and feelings of the reader. Thus, the allegorical method made it possible to safeguard the dignity and rationality of Homer's texts which were believed to be divinely inspired and which therefore had to be taken as being above any suspicion of immorality. Passages which might offend the moral convictions of the reader could now safely be interpreted as figurative.13 As we shall see, this congenial provision of the allegorical method will add to its attraction for Jewish and Christian interpreters. But before we arrive at specifically Christian hermeneutics we should at least glance at the spectrum of Jewish hermeneutics in the ist century ad, at the time of the emergence of the Christian movement. Traditionally, the Scriptures lay at the foundation of Israel's faith: they represent the divinely instituted order of life (Torah) and the divinely inspired account of Israel's history with Jahweh. Response to the Scriptures is response to God's call and will. The nature of inspiration of the Hebrew Scriptures differs significantly from the Greeks' belief in the divine inspi ration of their foundational literature: While the Greeks understood human</page><page sequence="5">178 HERMENEUTICS AND CHRISTIAN PRAXIS words to be inspired, Israel has understood the Torah to represent God's own words. Furthermore, the Torah contains the full truth for human life. As a result, the ongoing interpretation of its parts has been necessary in order to translate the meaning of these texts, i.e. the will of God, into the respective situation and time of God's people. Yet this task has never been regarded as easy since the texts contain difficult passages and are often far from being clear or coherent. The gap between the difficult, yet normative texts and the believer's longing for clear, coherent and intelligible interpreta tion and direction has provided the energy for Jewish hermeneutical reflection.14 Thus, Jewish hermeneutics served the faith praxis of Israel. Its primary concern was theologico-practical, whereas the primary concern of Greek hermeneutics was civic-practical. In the first century AD four principal methods of text interpretation were to be found in Israel and they reflect the different communities' practical concerns in doing biblical interpretation: Literalist, Midrashic, Pesher and Allegorical Interpretation.15 Literalist Interpretation took texts at face value and assessed their normative directions. Yet any attempt to gain an overall understanding of God's special relationship with his people has to transcend such a narrow reading and put it into a wider perspective. This was done in Midrashic Interpretation which was generally used in Rabbinic schools. Here a passage was to be penetrated for the disclosure of the spirit of the text. Sets of rules were developed in order to fight possible distortions in interpretations, such as the tailoring of a text's meaning to suit an overall interpretation imposed on it. Pesher Interpretation,16 particularly favoured in the Qumran community, claimed a special knowledge of divine mysteries and therefore a prerogative for its otherwise midrashic interpretation.17 It is on its way to becoming a fully fledged Allegorical Interpretation. As we have seen already allegorical interpretation understands the text as a symbolic universe accessible only for those readers who held the appropriate key. However, while in Pesher Interpretation the key is only available to an elite, allegorical interpretation wants to be a public enterprise and takes the 'key' from the experience of the readership. Allegorical interpretation allowed both Jewish and Christian theologians to defend the rationality of their sacred texts against the charges made by Pagan thinkers that the Bible contained nothing but mere fiction and crude mythology.18 Philo of Alexandria, the leading hermeneut of the time, 'was prepared to interpret allegorically anything that might derogate the dignity of the inspired words of God: anything that is nonsensical in the creation accounts, that is reprehensible in the legal portions, or that is trivial in the historical narratives of the Pentateuch'.19 But we ought not to be blinded by the apologetic use of the allegorical method. Its function goes far beyond: The allegorical method of interpreting the Scriptures allowed the reader to</page><page sequence="6">WERNER G. JEANROND 179 respect his or her own experiences and reason. Thus, Philo adopted and developed allegorical interpretation because it allowed him to correlate his theological insights and the biblical tradition, for instance in trying to safeguard the transcendence of God when biblical passages spoke in an anthropomorphic manner about God.20 The allegorical method was ideal for Christian thinkers who suffered under the pagan challenge to prove the rationality of their faith and under the Jewish critique that they misunderstood the Scriptures. Against these critiques from outside and against the gnostic elitist interpretation from within, Christians using the allegorical method could show 1) how to understand Jesus Christ in the light of the Scriptures, and 2) how their experience of Jesus Christ provided the key through which to interpret the Hebrew Scriptures. All Christian centres of learning, even Antioch which favoured grammatical exegesis, agreed that the Hebrew Scriptures typified, that is anticipated, Jesus Christ, and therefore needed to be read in the light of their experience of Jesus Christ, that means typologically.21 The early church agreed with Israel on the normativity of the Hebrew Scriptures and on the principal methods of interpretation, yet it insisted on the authority of its particular set of experiences serving now as key, as perspective through which to read the texts. The difference between Christian and Jewish hermeneutics is, thus, not to be found in their respective methods but in their differing faith praxis. The hermeneutical experience of Christians influenced, of course, every sermon, liturgy, letter, gospel and tractate, yet some theologians dealt explicitly with hermeneutical questions, especially when they were forced to defend their interpretative strategies against gnostic interpreters. The first systematic attempt to discuss hermeneutics among Christian thinkers was made by Origen in his book Peri Archon (On First Principles). Origen distinguished between the text's literal sense and its spiritual senses.22 The literal sense needs to be understood first, but only on the second level, the disclosure of the text's spiritual sense, does Christian interpretation come to its own.23 Since the Scriptures contain the ultimate mystery, expressed in symbols, only an allegorical interpretation which is guided by God's spirit can allow the reader to understand this mystery.24 Thus, for Origen, Christian praxis is necessary before any adequate understanding can occur, because only out of a lived Christian faith can the necessary spiritual perspective of biblical interpretation emerge.25 Origen's strongest critics worked in the School of Antioch. Here the text itself was expected to demonstrate its spiritual potential without the application of outside perspectives. The text was understood as a more or less realistic depiction of events and facts.26 However, a spiritual assessment happened in Antioch, too. For some texts did not pass the interpretive test of</page><page sequence="7">i8o HERMENEUTICS AND CHRISTIAN PRAXIS their spiritual value for the church, and were therefore not considered worthy of inclusion in the respective canon of Scripture. Both Antiochene and Alexandrian hermeneutics were, of course, open to distortion: Alexandrian allegorists could be accused of risking the imposition of alien perspectives on the text, i.e. of doing eisegesis; and Antiochene realists could be accused of becoming biblicists either by separating the act of reading from the praxis of the Christian community or by correlating experience and text interpretation but not revealing the perspective actually applied. 3. THE LEGACY OF AUGUSTINE'S HERMENEUTICS Once the originating experience of the Christian movement, the experience of God in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth had become an event of a more and more distant past and was retrievable only through a new set of normative texts, the New Testament and the recently formulated credal formulas, the relationship between text interpretation and Christian praxis had to be worked out anew. This task was undertaken systematically by Augustine of Hippo in his book De Doctrina Christiana (On Christian Teaching).27 Augustine saw the need both for a spiritual interpretation firmly based on a reading of the biblical texts themselves and for a semiotic theory which defined the nature and function of all linguistic signs in order to rule out any naive literalism or biblicism. On the basis of his theory of signs, Augustine emphasized that the Scriptures are not God, but that they refer to God. They are to be used in order to direct the reader towards adopting the proper attitude towards God, towards him/herself and towards the fellow human being.28 What the Scriptures ultimately demand from the reader is acceptance of God's gift, that is love. Love is the theological reading perspective which Augustine distilled through his own reading of the biblical texts.29 For Augustine there was no doubt that any spiritual reading of the biblical texts would point the believer to God's love as it should be practised by the entire Christian community. Thus, Augustine's hermeneutics is not speculative, but guided by his concern to help the reader of the Bible to retrieve the centre of Christian faith for his or her life. The biblical text is useful but not of ultimate necessity for the realization of Christian existence. What counts is the presence of God's loving spirit and the adequate human response, but not the adherence to a particular canon of writings.30 Nevertheless, Augustine emphasizes the need for a careful consideration of the hermeneutical problems and intricacies by everybody involved in biblical interpretation.31 Signs can have a direct reference or they may function figuratively. Signs of both kinds may be unknown or ambiguous. A good general education is necessary to understand signs, but only an active</page><page sequence="8">WERNER G. JEANROND 181 involvement in the Christian community of interpreters, the church, can provide the context for the clarification of dark and difficult passages in the Bible. The rule of faith of the Christian church, i.e. the living tradition of Christian praxis, is the framework in which a possible pluralism of interpretations may be appreciated.32 Augustine's theological hermeneutics is circular: on the one hand reading the biblical texts instructs the community, and on the other hand it is the community which lives according to the spirit, witnessed to by the Scriptures, which provides the necessary perspective for reading the Bible. Thus, theological hermeneutics is inseparable from Christian praxis: it frees the interpreter from text-slavery and enriches his/her faith praxis by demonstrating how his/her own spiritual renewal can be found through the act of interpretation within the community of interpreters. Augustine's hermeneutics draws from both traditions of Christian hermeneutics: his semiotics is in line with Antiochene considerations, his insistence on the priority of spiritual praxis as context for interpretation follows Alexandrian concerns. The problem with Augustine's and subsequent hermeneutical reflection in medieval Christianity is, however, that the faith praxis of the church which provided the perspectives for proper reading was itself an interpretative construction with more and more formalized institutional support struc tures. Particularly the emerging clergy-laity division, the Roman claims of primacy in the church of the West, and the increasing legalization of doctrines often guaranteed by state support for the church, affected the actual praxis of interpretation in the church. While Augustine's De Doctrina Christiana is still inspired by the author's concern to instruct every intelligent reader, subsequent hermeneutical reflection aimed exclusively at educating the theological expert. A comprehensive sociology of Christian knowledge would need to examine this development and its consequences for the church more fully. A brief look at the history of Christian hermeneutics in the Middle Ages shows that at first biblical interpretation in the monastic tradition continued to use the allegorical method as developed by the Fathers.33 The literal sense served the grasping of the res gesta, the divine revelation, which once identified needed to be interpreted spiritually. The allegorical exposition of the spiritual meaning of the text passage and its ethical (tropological) and eschatological (anagogical) implications constituted the heart of early medieval exegesis. Following the Scholastic Revolution, the hermeneutical reflection em barked on a new course. A new concentration on the actual text, its literal sense, promoted the establishment of the academic treatment of exegesis in the emerging universities. Exegesis now meant the study of the manuscript</page><page sequence="9">182 HERMENEUTICS AND CHRISTIAN PRAXIS (Text-Kritik) and the grammatical consideration of the text. The discussion and systematization of the theological content of the text led to a more and more independent theology whose concern for the actual text was limited to the identification of passages which would support the theological interest pursued by the theologian. Nevertheless, owing to the renewed interest in the biblical text, the study of the classical languages, i.e. Greek and Hebrew, was propagated which in turn prepared the way for the fresh reading of the original texts by the Protestant Reformers. Martin Luther's hermeneutics was fuelled both by his growing mistrust of the legalized and mystified praxis of administering the gospel of Christ in the church and by his own original reading of the biblical texts. His reforma tional discovery, the justification by faith alone, was in fact nothing other than the decision in favour of a particular perspective through which he intrepreted the biblical texts and which was itself a product of his own interpretation.34 Thus, comparing Luther's and Augustine's hermeneutics, one could formulate: what love was for Augustine, justification by faith was for Luther. Yet in spite of this structural similarity between the two, Luther's sola scriptura differed radically from Augustine's insistence that a faithful and loving human being could do God's will without reference to the biblical text. For Augustine the biblical texts functioned more pedagogically, for Luther more soteriologically.35 The Protestant Orthodoxy, however, enshrined the reading perspectives of the reformers and thus curtailed anew the freedom of the Christian believer to interpret the biblical texts in the light of their own faith praxis and their own biblically based reading perspectives. As in the Roman Catholic Church, and as indeed wherever a particular interpretation is petrified, the Protestant faith praxis now became reductionist, repetitive and formal. This brings us back to the context of Schleiermacher's hermeneutical reflection. 4. MODERN HERMENEUTICS AND CHRISTIAN PRAXIS Friedrich Schleiermacher transformed hermeneutics radically. Once a theo logical subdiscipline, it became now an independent philosophical disci pline.36 Schleiermacher rejected the priority of any special hermeneutics, such as theological or legal hermeneutics, and he refused to accept any claims of particular prerogatives in textual understanding, as were commonly made both in Protestantism and in Roman Catholicism. Rather Schleiermacher explored text understanding as such and defined it as the reproductive appropriation of an original human expression. For him, the possibility of such an appropriation owes itself to our common human congeniality. It would be wrong, however, to limit Schleiermacher's hermeneutics to</page><page sequence="10">WERNER G. JEANROND 183 this psychological accord between the reader and the mind of the author as represented by the text. Rather we have to acknowledge that in his hermeneutical reflection Schleiermacher dealt also with the function of language in the act of understanding. For him every interpretive activity is based on an interplay between grammatical and psychological understand ing. Therefore, he urges every interpreter to give equal attention to both of these aspects of text interpretation.37 Comparing Schleiermacher and Augustine, we observe clear parallels with regard to their semiotic concerns and their rejection of the absolute necessity of the Bible for proper Christian praxis, yet we see strong differences as regards the function of the community of interpreters. For Augustine the aim of theological hermeneutics was to direct the faith praxis of the Christian in the church, whereas according to Schleiermacher's general hermeneutics the primary aim of understanding is the individual interpreter's interaction with the text. Thus, Schleiermacher's immediate concern is the hermeneutical praxis of the individual. He considers social praxis only in so far as the individual participates in human communication and may alter the grammatical conventions of the respective linguistic society. Schleiermacher clearly subordinates actual interpretation of the Bible to his general principles of interpretation.38 Schleiermacher's contribution to general hermeneutical insight was enor mous: he showed that an exhaustive understanding of a text is impossible. Approximation is all we can seriously aim at. He emphasized the need for a theory of text, and he elaborated the dialectical relationship between text and reading. The implications of every act of writing and reading received much clarification. Yet the community of interpreters enters the focus of his attention only as a linguistic entity, not as a social phenomenon. Neverthe less, Schleiermacher did reject the two-class system in Roman Catholicism with its clerical control over biblical interpretation.39 However, even though Schleiermacher did not contribute to the rediscovery of the ethical and social implications of text understanding, we ought to appreciate that it was he who first paved the way for a recognition of everybody's right to be involved in text interpretation at a time when this right was denied by the forces of political and ecclesiastical restoration. After Schleiermacher, the development of hermeneutics as a fundamental discipline for the humanities has been furthered mainly by philosophers, such as Dilthey, Heidegger, Wach, Gadamer, Ricoeur, Habermas and Derrida.40 Yet their respective contributions affected theological thinking usually without delay as the debate between Barth and Bultmann and the works of such theologians as Braun, Fuchs, Pannenberg, Ebeling, Schille beeckx and Tracy have amply demonstrated. A detailed discussion of these contributions is, of course, not possible within the limits of this paper. A few</page><page sequence="11">184 HERMENEUTICS AND CHRISTIAN PRAXIS observations must suffice in order to prepare our way back to the call for praxis as foundation of theological thinking. The debate between Barth and Bultmann concentrated on the question of the relationship between hermeneutics and theology.41 Barth, in line with Augustine and Luther, defended the necessity of a theological perspective for any reading of the Bible: God is in heaven and you on earth. This God's relationship to this man, this man's relationship to this God is for me the theme of the Bible and the sum of philosophy at once.42 Barth's theological perspective is the result both of his biblical reading and of his assessment of the requirements of Christian praxis at the time of crisis between the two world wars. Bultmann, in line with Schleiermacher, was interested in examining the principal existential context in which the biblical texts were read and understood by modern readers. Following Martin Heidegger, Bultmann analysed the structure of the interpretive process and the nature and function of the interpreter's presuppositions in this process.43 Whereas for Barth the hermeneutical problem consisted in relating Scripture and church,44 for Bultmann the hermeneutical problem was the relationship between ancient text and the modern, secular world of the reader. Thus, both theologians reflected on praxis, but defined their respective praxis differently. Barth's praxis was the church, Bultmann's the Christian in the modern secular world; Barth's interpretation theory was to help the church's response to God's call in Christ, Bultmann's hermeneutics was to help the individual to understand and practise Christian faith. Both, Barth and Bultmann, as Schleiermacher long before them, recog nized the limitations of a purely historical critical interpretation of the Bible.45 Both agreed that biblical interpretation ought not to be reduced to a demonstration of the history behind the texts. While they considered such historical study useful, they identified as the real aim of biblical interpret ation the transformation of human existence, of human praxis according to the Christian Spirit as manifested in the biblical texts. David Tracy agrees with Barth's and Bultmann's assessment of the historical method and urges the interpreter to advance to the actual task of interpreting the facts and expressions gathered by historical research: When all historical work completes its judgements of historical probability, we do not end but begin anew our proper task of understanding by interpreting. For interpreters, now historically informed, must return again to the task of understanding by conversing with the claim to attention of classic texts and</page><page sequence="12">WERNER G. JEANROND 185 events. No amount of historical reconstruction can spare us that further effort.46 Tracy has contributed much to interpretation theory by adopting and developing the hermeneutical reflections of Gadamer and Ricoeur whose achievements we were about to celebrate when the call for praxis disturbed the laudatio and led us to review the career of theological hermeneutics. Our brief and fragmented narrative of the history of hermeneutics has, I hope, at least demonstrated that all hermeneuts under discussion were engaged in understanding texts in and for a particular practical horizon. The Greeks were concerned with the right civic praxis; the Jews with the right relationship with Jahweh, i.e. with proper religious praxis; Origen and the earlier Church Fathers with the right Christian praxis, a religious praxis informed both by the Hebrew Scriptures and a new set of experiences through which the Scriptures were to be read; Augustine with love, for him the most essential criterion for adequate Christian praxis; the medieval monks interpreted the biblical texts spiritually and considered their ethical and eschatological implications for monastic life; the scholastic theologians were interested in theological praxis, the praxis of thinking properly about God and the universe; the Reformers aimed at renewing the faith praxis of all Christians, not only clerical theologians; Protestant and Roman Catholic Orthodoxies have been interested in preserving a particular praxis against new interpretive challenges; Schleiermacher questioned such a praxis and demanded a new hermeneutical freedom for everybody by concentrating on the implications of common linguistic praxis; Barth's praxis was the church, Bultmann's the horizon of the modern believer, Tracy's is the academy, the church and the society at once.47 In view of this plurality of practical horizons which led theologians throughout the history of the Christian movement to search for more adequate ways of bridging the gap between the expressions of tradition and their own faith praxis, it would seem superfluous to call Christian herme neutics back to praxis. Why then the new call for praxis by Metz and other contemporary theologians? Christian praxis for Metz is social praxis characterized by 1) ethical determination, 2) an engaged memory of the gospel, and 3) solidarity with the poor, the suffering, the marginalized, the dead, and with present and past victims of injustice.48 This understanding of Christian praxis is informed by a rereading of the Christian gospel through a perspective trained by marxist analysis and related social theory (Frankfurt School). Thus, Metz' call for praxis is the result of an application of a particular interpretation theory which aims at correlating the gospel and contemporary social analysis. This is, of course, legitimate and necessary, because these new perspectives have</page><page sequence="13">186 HERMENEUTICS AND CHRISTIAN PRAXIS helped all of us better to appropriate the ethical challenge present in our classical biblical texts as well as to recognize the ethical dimension of all interpretation. Combining the Frankfurt School's insight into the potentially anti ideological function of the community of interpreters and the rediscovery of Christian love and solidarity as creating the context in which human beings may become responsible subjects, Metz has shown in an excellent way how proper hermeneutics can work, and needs to call for a corresponding reform of present church praxis.49 However, this is not a radically new departure in hermeneutics, rather it builds on the best of our Christian hermeneutical tradition: namely on the Church Fathers' recognition of the ethical dimension of Christian faith and on Augustine's and Schleiermacher's insights into the semiotic foundation of our understanding. It does, however, correct one reductionist focus of Schleiermacher's philosophical hermeneutics and of Protestant hermeneutics in general: the focus on the individual interpreter.50 Schleiermacher rediscovered the semiotic dimension of human under standing after Augustine's thoughts had been forgotton, Metz the ethical political dimension which was, at least in principle, recognized already in allegorical interpretation. Both of these dimensions are necessary dimensions of any interpretation theory which wishes to serve human understanding and praxis in general and Christian self-understanding and praxis in particular.

Gerhard Ebeling, 'Die AnfÃ¤nge von Luthers Hermeneutik', Luth erstudien I (TÃ¼bingen, J. C. B. Mohr (Paul Siebeck), 1971), 1-68. 35 In 'Luther und die Bibel', Lutherstudien I, op. cit., 286â301, Ebeling emphasizes that it is the theological centre of the Scripture, i.e. Christ, and not the Scriptures as a system which cause Luther to postulate the sola scriptura. The truth of the Bible is what it has to say about our salvation through Christ. 36 Cf. Werner G. Jeanrond, 'The Impact of Schleiermacher's Hermeneutics on Con temporary Interpretation Theory', in The Interpretation of Belief: Coleridge, Schleiermacher and Romanticism.

(Heidelberg, Carl Winter, 1974), 77. 38 On the basis of this general interpretation theory, Schleiermacher does, of course, develop a particular theological herme neutics which serves the church govern ment, that is the church praxis. This special hermeneutics is, however, depen dent on the general hermeneutics and thus shares in its shortcomings. For Schleierma cher's discussion of theological hermeneu tics see his Kurze Darstellung des theologischen Studiums zum Behuf einleiten der Vorlesungen. Ed., Heinrich Scholz (Darmstadt, Wiss. Buchgesellschaft, 1977), 43-58 ( = Â§Â§103-48). 39 Hermeneutik, 55. 40 For a good collection of essential texts which document the recent development of hermeneutics cf.

For a very helpful discussion of Metz' argument cf. Dermot A. Lane, Foundations for a Social Theology, i6ff. 49 Metz, op. cit., i2off. 50 Occasionally Metz confuses the function of hermeneutics with the concrete result of the correlation of Christian inter pretations of the tradition and Christian interpretations of the world, i.e. the contemporary hermeneutical horizon. Cf. for instance his call for a 'political herme neutics of danger' in his contribution 'Theologie im neuen Paradigma: Poli tische Theologie' for Hans KÃ¼ng and David Tracy.
