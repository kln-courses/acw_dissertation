Patrick Wayne State University DETAILS OF THE biomechanical evaluation of a new lami- nated windshield, called Ten-Twenty, which establishes its per- formance in terms of head deceleration and facial laceration, are presented in two parts. The first part comprises evalua- tions by Triplex using drop-test and skull impactor methods. The second part reports the evaluation conducted by Wayne State University (WSU) using a 50th percentile anthropomor- phic dummy and the WHAM III sled test facility. Other prop- erties are also discussed. DESIRABLE WINDSHIELD PROPERTIES Automobile safety authorities and the international safety- glass industry generally agree that an improved car windshield should have satisfactory performance in the product proper- ties listed below: 1. Head deceleration performance. 2. Lacerative potential. 3. Resistance to penetration by head impact. ABSTRACT A new laminated automobile windshield called Triplex Ten- Twenty, fabricated from two thermally stressed glass plies of 2.3 mm soda-lime float glass laminated with a 0.76 mm HPR polyvinyl butyral interlayer, has been biomechanically eval- uated by Triplex Safety Glass Co., Ltd., using a dropping head form and a skull impactor, and by Wayne State University, using a 50th percentile anthropomorphic dummy on the WHAM III sled test facility. The results of these evaluations at velocities up to 60 km/h are expressed in terms of Gadd index, head injury criterion, and various laceration scales in- cluding the new Triplex laceration index (TLI). Some details are also given of other properties of the windshield. The re- sults of the evaluations indicate that the Ten-Twenty wind- shield offers a reduction of about two units on the TLI scale equivalent to one of the following: 1 . A 99% reduction in the number of cuts when the length and depth of cuts remain unaltered. 2. A 90% reduction in the length of cuts when the number and depth of cuts remain unaltered. 3. A change in depth of cuts from one layer of skin simula- tion to another, but in particular a 78.5% reduction in the depth of cuts into the polyvinyl chloride base layer when the number and length of cuts remain unaltered. In practice, the length, number, and depth of cuts all change together so that one typical example taken from the test pro- gram of a two-unit reduction in TLI is: 1 . A 62% reduction in the average depth of cuts into the polyvinyl chloride base. 2. A 27% reduction in the average length of cuts. 3. No increase in the total number of cuts. On the basis of these results, Ten-Twenty is a much safer laminated automobile windshield than those now commer- cially available due to decreased laceration to the occupants during a collision. 3174</page><page sequence="2">4. Penetration resistance, retention of vision, and protection of occupants against hostile climatic conditions in the event of stone impact. 5. Insensitivi ty of product properties to the effect of nor- mal handling and abrasion. . 6. Insensitivi ty of the product properties to extremes of temperature. 7. Optical quality. Clearly, it is important that an improvement in one property should not be offset by a significant worsening of another when compared to existing commercial products and standards. With the introduction of high penetration resistant (HPR) polyvinyl butyral interlayers, the risk of penetration of the windshield during head impact has been reduced without ex- ceeding the accepted standards for head deceleration perfor- mance. The head deceleration performance has been further improved to some extent by the use of thinner glass in lami- nated windshields (1)*. Due to the importance of laceration from windshields, the most significant further improvement in windshield performance would be to reduce the degree of facial laceration in the event of head impact. The work re- ported in this paper demonstrates that the Ten-Twenty wind- shield offers a substantial improvement in laceration without penalty or offset to the other six main properties. PRESENT PRODUCT SPECIFICATION The Ten-Twenty windshield consists of two pieces of 2.3 mm soda-lime float glass laminated with a standard 0.76 mm HPR polyvinyl butyral interlayer. The work reported here refers to laminates in which the in- ner glass ply is thermally tempered to a center tensile stress of 47 ± 3 MPa. The outer glass ply is lightly thermally tempered to a center tensile stress of about 7 MPa; typical stress profiles for these glasses are shown in Fig. 1 . The windshield performance has been evaluated by compari- son with the two main types of symmetrical, laminated wind- shields now in commercial use: 1. The conventional 2.5 mm windshield consisting of two plies of 2.5 mm float glass laminated together using a standard HPR 0.76 mm interlayer. 2. The conventional 3 mm windshield consisting of two plies of 3 mm float glass laminated together using the same standard 0.76 mm interlayer. With all the windshields in these comparative evaluations, the interlayer and adhesion characteristics were kept identical. HEAD DECELERATION AND LACERATION TESTING All the available test methods were studied and the follow- ing chosen as being the most suitable for preliminary deter- mination of the safety characteristics of a windshield: 1. For head deceleration comparisons- a simple dropping headform. *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. 100 2 3mm » , 00 i ' 6°" / 2 ' / cr» ' / 2 ' o / £ ' 40 £ * / x ' * / S ' cił / ' %*J / ' 20 5 J /' 20- /' mm/ ' / ,NNER g COMPONE Ml ' t|. / C0MP0NtMT ū» _ W Fig. 1 - Stress profiles for two components of Ten-Twenty windshield 2. For facial laceration comparisons- a skull impactor. These have the advantage of being simple, reproducible, and rapid, permitting large numbers of windshields to be impacted with a minimum of scatter in the experimental results. This is important in the development of a new product where a large number of variables have to be optimized and new con- structions tried as quickly as possible if the development pro- gram is not to be delayed by the testing procedures. DROP TEST-HEAD ACCELERATION EVALUATION - A 10 kg (2) head form was dropped onto a windshield mounted normally to the direction of the impact. The test was used to determine deceleration characteristics, Gadd severity index (SI), and head injury criteria (HIC) at velocities up to 46 km/h. Table 1 sets out results of normal, central impacts on Ten- Twenty windshields of the Volvo 142 shape. For comparison, results are also shown for similar impacts made in the same test series on the same shape of conventional annealed glass windshields. These impacts were all performed at 20°C on windshields clamped into a wooden buck. The head form was equipped with piezoresistive accelerometers. The acceleration output was recorded on an ultraviolet recorder with a 1 kHz pass- band. A typical deceleration pattern is shown in Fig. 2. Photo- graphs of typical fractured windshields are given in Figs. 3-5. Graphical presentation of the results in terms of SI against headform impact velocity is presented in Fig. 6, where the lines plotted are the least squares fit of straight lines to the data up to penetration of the interlayer. It can be seen that the results for Ten-Twenty are superior to those for the conventional 2.5 and 3 mm windshields. Statistical testing of these results shows that the improvement in SI of Ten-Twenty over that of the conventional 3 mm lami- 3175</page><page sequence="3">3176 S. E. KAY, ET AL.

The improvement over the conventional 2.5 mm is significant at the 5% level. When the head acceleration results were plotted in terms of HIC (Fig. 7), the results were in a similar order, but the differences were not statistically significant. HIC and SI were, for all the versions of windshields tested, below 300 units at the onset of penetra- tion; that is, well below the limiting value of 1000 units. Anal- ysis of the results in Table 1 shows that for Ten-Twenty, the peak accelerations due to the breaking of the glass plies were somewhat lower than those for the conventional annealed</page><page sequence="4">LAMINATED WINDSHIELD WITH REDUCED LACERATION PROPERTIES 3 1 77 TEN TWENTY WINDSME10 I 1 1 1 1 1 IMPACTES AT )0km/h ™30 - ļ ļ s 20 Ui / ' (J / ' UJ / ' o I / ' 10 20 30 40 SO TIME ms Fig. 2 - Typical deceleration trace for Ten-Twenty windshield Fig. 3 - Typical fracture of conventional 2.5 mm laminated windshield Fig. 4 - Typical fracture of conventional 3 mm laminated windshield</page><page sequence="5">3178 S.

This advantage is a consequence of using thinner glass which has a moderate modulus of rupture. A similar ef- fect was reported by Alexander, Mattimoe, and Hoffman (1). No significant difference was detected in the penetration ve- locities of the three types of windshields. SKULL IMPACT RIG-FACIAL LACERATION EVALUA- TION - This is similar to the type of equipment used by Corn- ing, which has already been reported to give good agreement with the more complex anthropomorphic dummy impacts (3). The rig used in this work was designed to give improved repeatability and also to give scope for possible future up- grading. The rig is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 8. A more detailed drawing of the trolley and pivoting arm is given in Fig. 9. It was made very robust, and the mass of the trolley carrying the pivoted headform was increased to 45 kg to rep- resent more closely the inertia of a dummy torso. The stop- ping distance used for each of the impact tests was 25 mm, so that the total movement of the pivot carrying the headform</page><page sequence="6">LAMINATED WINDSHIELD WITH REDUCED LACERATION PROPERTIES 3 1 79 Fig. 7 - HIC as function of impact velocity by dropping headform test Fig. 8 - Skull impact test rig and arm was in each case less than 25 mm for the duration of the impact and the plow-in of the headform. This rig was used principally to measure laceration. Measurement of Laceration - Two layers of carefully selected moist chamois leather, each of 1 ±0.15 mm thickness, were used to simulate facial skin. A replaceable skullcap of mold- able polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material was used to simulate subcutaneous tissue. During the course of this work, the inadequacy of existing laceration scales and, in particular, the high degree of sub- jectivity involved in using them became evident. In order to quantify laceration more reliably and much more objectively,</page><page sequence="7">3180 S. E. KAY, ET AL. Fig. 9 - Carriage and headform assembly of skull impact test rig a new laceration index was developed, which is known as the Triplex laceration index (TLI). This is a nonsubjective, con- tinuous, unbounded scale that relies solely upon accurate mea- surements of the cuts produced in two layers of moist chamois leather and the underlying layer of soft PVC. It does not de- pend upon the idiosyncrasies of the assessor. The scale itself and its derivation will not be described in detail here since this is the subject of a separate paper (4). Numerically it is based on, and is in good agreement with, the scale devised by Corning (3) between the numbers 0 and 9, while possessing substantial advantages over previous methods in its application. Leathers and PVC were chosen to be as close as possible to the SAE recommendations (5). Mathematical analysis of the experimental results led to the derivation from first principles of a logarithmic formula for this laceration index. Thus, TLI = 2 + log10 (1 + 1.16 Dļ +50.8D2 + 16,500 D3) (1) where: Dj, D2, D3 = lacerative damage in three layers of tissue simulation D1 =I&gt;lss2 (2) S D2 = I&gt;2ss2 (3) S D3 -EX^sd*2"3 &lt;«&gt; d s Table 2 - Conversion from TLI to Lacerative Damage Corresponding Change in Change in Level of Level of Total TLI Units Lacerative Damage 0 X 1 1 X 10 1.2 X 16 1.4 X 25 1.6 X 40 1.8 X 63 2.0 X100 where: s = length of cut, mm d = depth of cut into PVC, mm njs = number of cuts of length s in first (outer) leather n2s = number of cuts of length s in second (inner) leather n3sd = num^er °f cuts of length s and depth d into PVC It can be seen that the quantity 1.16 Dj + 50.8 D2 + 16,500 D3 represents a measure of the total lacerative damage. It can also be seen that because TLI is a logarithmic unit to the base 10, a change of one unit in TLI represents a tenfold change in the total lacerative damage. A change of one unit can be rep- resented as a tenfold change in the number of cuts, or a three- fold change in the length of cuts, or about a twofold change in the depth of deep cuts into the PVC. Examples of lacerative damage corresponding to TLI values 6, 9, and 12 are given in Figs. 10-12. A conversion table from TLI to total lacerative damage is given in Table 2. The TLI gives reasonably good straight-line plots of lacera- tion injury against impact velocity, and this greatly assists the statistical analysis of results. Laceration Results - Table 3 sets out the laceration results obtained on the skull impactor rig on windshields similar to those used on the drop rig. In this case, the windshields were clamped by a continuous rubber-lined metal strip into the glazing aperture of a Volvo car. Again, all these tests were done at 20°C. The velocity indicated is the trolley velocity immediately before impact. The laceration results are quoted in terms of TLI and are shown graphically in Fig. 13. The lines plotted show the least-squares regression of TLI on ve- locity for all impacts in which the screens were fractured. It can be seen that the average improvement of the Ten-Twenty windshield over the conventional 2.5 mm annealed glass wind- shield is 2.0 units, and the average improvement over the 3 mm annealed glass windshields is 2.7 units. These results rep- resent a reduction in the quantity "total lacerative damage" of about 100 times and 500 times, respectively. No attempt has been made to give a medical interpretation to these re- sults. The easiest interpretation can be made from the form- ula for TLI by the fact that an improvement of two unitscan</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 10 - Facial tissue simulation used on skull impact test rig, TLI = 6 Fig. 1 1 - Facial tissue simulation used on skull impact test rig, TLI = 9 Fig. 12 - Facial tissue simulation used on skull impact test rig, TLI =12</page><page sequence="9">3182 S.

A reduction in numbers of cuts by 41%. The improvement of 2 and 2.7 units for the Ten-Twenty windshield over the conventional windshields is significant at the 1% level and has been achieved with no penalty in head deceleration performance. FULL-SCALE VEHICLE EVALUATION AT WAYNE A comparison of the safety performance of the experimental Ten-Twenty windshield with conventional annealed glass wind- shields was made on WHAM III at WSU. The experiments were conducted in a modified Volvo Model 142 automobile with the windshield installed with butyl tape, which is one of the conventional methods used in the United States. The oc- cupant was a Sierra 1050 anthropomorphic dummy located in the passenger seat of the modified vehicle. Modifications to the vehicle included the removal of the en- gine, transmission, and other concentrated masses that do not contribute to the interior dynamics of the vehicle, and the ad- dition of strengthening members to the frame of the vehicle so as to permit it to be subjected to deceleration pulses similar to those encountered in collisions without being destroyed. The modified vehicle and occupant were accelerated over 72 ft with uniform acceleration to the predetermined experimen- tal velocity, and then decelerated with a deceleration pulse and stopping distance corresponding to that of the collision under consideration. A steel seat construction was used in place of the conven- tional seat to minimize the variations in the test procedure</page><page sequence="11">3184 S. E. KAY, ET AL. Fig. 14 - Vehicle with dummy installed on WHAM III and the effect of degradation of the conventional seat during the program. Nonresilient energy-absorbing foam was placed under the instrument panel in the knee impact area to provide a uniform decelerating medium for the knees. The foam was replaced after each run. The instrument panel and pad were also replaced when damaged. The doors were removed from the vehicle to permit high-speed cinematography of the event. Fig. 14 shows the vehicle with the dummy installed ready for one of the tests on WHAM III. The temperature of the wind- shields and the laboratory was maintained between 21-23°C. Laceration from the windshield impact was evaluated by placing two layers of moist chamois over the head of the dummy. The chamois can be seen in Fig. 15 after impact. To permit use of the TLI, it was necessary to modify the head of the dummy by removing the rubberlike skin normally on the dummy head, and replacing it with a PVC mold of identical exterior contour. The PVC covering was replaced each time it was lacerated in a windshield impact. After placing the PVC covering over the facial area of the dummy, the head was covered with two layers of 1 mm thick chamois. The chamois were moistened and wrung out until they changed to a light color prior to being placed on the dummy head. They were fastened to the head with tape around the neck and in the occipital area of the head. Potential injury to the brain was measured by a triaxial accelerometer mounted at the e.g. of the dummy head. The triaxial acceleration was used to calcu- late the HIC and SI. Signals from the accelerometers were transmitted through trailing cables to the electronic condition- ing equipment on the control console. The conditioned sig- nals including the calibrations for each run were recorded on a Sangamo Model 3500 tape recorder. The tape records were displayed on a lightbeam galvanometer oscillograph (Honey- well Model 1508 Visicorder). After each run, a sample was cut from the corner of the windshield and used for a pummel test (6) to check on glass-to-interlayer adhesion levels. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS - The experimental results are shown in Table 5, which is a summary of the data including Fig. 15 - Chamois on dummy after run T-33 illustrating laceration of TLI 7.4 the velocity, stopping distance, type of windshield, head in- jury indexes, three different laceration indexes, the pummel number for each windshield, and comments on the particular run. Fig. 16 is a plot of the TLI as a function of velocity with the best fit, first-order regression curve for the two types of windshields shown. The HIC indexes as functions of velocity are shown in Fig. 17 with best fit, first-order curves included. In Table 5, the velocity varies from 16-55 km/h, the stop- ping distance from 200 to 710 mm, and the pummel range from 3 to 5. In the "remarks" column, abnormal conditions are noted. Some runs have been excluded from this table; for example, in runs T-l and T-2, the head hit the visor or the header invalidating the test. Any run in which there was sub- stantial windshield pull-out due to poor bonding was also eliminated from consideration in the experimental data.</page><page sequence="12">Table 5 - Summary of Data Analysis for Triplex Windshield Laceration Study at WSU Stopping Laceration Index* Run Type of Velocity, Distance, Head Index Corning No. Windshield km/h mm Gadd HIC WSU Scale TLI Pummel Remarks T- 4 2.5 mm 34.1 410 253 220 3 4 4.9 3 Abrasion on forehead T- 5 Ten-Twenty 33.5 410 200 164 1 4 5.3 3 Light abrasion on forehead T- 6 2.5 mm 34.1 410 248 202 3 5 6.2 4 Windshield slightly pulled out, abrasion on forehead T- 7 Ten-Twenty 32.8 410 249 196 1 3 3.8 5 Abrasion on forehead, one cut through outer layer on nose T-10 2.5 mm 16.3 300 11 9 0 0 0 5 Head broke outer glass, no cuts T-ll Ten-Twenty 16.9 200 1311 0 0 0 5 Head broke outer glass, no cuts T-14 2.5 mm 24.8 300 67 55 1 4 5.2 4 Light abrasion and few small cuts on forehead and nose T-15 Ten-Twenty 24.9 300 131 82 1 3 3.2 3 Abrasion on forehead T-16 2.5 mm 36.7 500 576 482 3 4 5.4 3 Severe abrasion and a few cuts on forehead, buttocks slid off seat, legs jammed under in- strument panel T-17 Ten-Twenty 41.5 500 677 423 1 3 4.1 4 Severe abrasion on forehead and nose, no SI acceleration T-18 2.5 mm 42.2 500 465 393 3 4 5.9 3 Lacerations and severe abrasion on forehead, abrasions on nose T-19 Ten-Twenty 27.5 330 371 121 0 0 0 5 T-20 2.5 mm 28.3 330 172 113 0 0 0 3 T-21 2.5 mm 33.1 410 174 143 3 4 5.4 3 Abrasions and cuts on forehead T-22 Ten-Twenty 32.0 410 278 222 1 2 3.4 4 Scratches on forehead T-23 2.5 mm 33.0 410 229 161 1 3 3.6 4 Scratches on forehead T-24 Ten-Twenty 32.3 410 175 131 1 1 1 4 Scratches on forehead T-25 Ten-Twenty 43.9 610 787 606 3 4 4.9 3 Severe abrasions on forehead, dummy slid off seat T-27 Ten-Twenty 45.9 610 582 494 3 4 5.2 3 127 mm tear (vertical), severe abrasions with few cuts on forehead and nose T-28 2.5 mm 46.0 610 570 482 6 5 6.2 5 50 mm tear, several cuts on fore- head and near right eye T-29 2.5 mm 45.9 610 593 463 6 6 6.8 3 More severe abrasions on fore- head, cuts on forehead, eyes, and nose T-30 Ten-Twenty 54.1 710 871 523 6 6 7.1 3 267 mm jagged tear, extensive lacerations through outer chamois and couple of cuts through inner chamois T-31 2.5 mm 55.0 710 747 584 6 7 8.3 3 50 X 152 mm tear, severe lacera- tions through both layers of chamois, 1 1 mm cut on chin in rubber flesh T-32 Ten-Twenty 55.0 710 798 643 6 6 7.3 3 216 mm jagged tear, severe lacerations through both layers of chamois, no cuts in rubber flesh T-33 2.5 mm 55.0 710 905 673 6 6 7.4 3 Severe lacerations through layers of chamois, no cut in rubber flesh T-35 Ten-Twenty 22.5 330 258 167 0 0 0 3 No fracture T-36 Ten-Twenty 32.2 410 1380 811 0 0 0 3 No fracture T-37 Ten-Twenty 39.3 500 836 543 1 2 3.1 3 T-38 2.5 mm 23.3 330 114 68 1/3 3 4.4 4 T45 Ten-Twenty 32.2 410 1069 568 0 0 0 4 No lacerations T-47 2.5 mm 33.1 410 329 268 3/6 5 5.8 4 T48 Ten-Twenty 25.4 330 330 185 1/3 3 2.7 4 T-50 2.5 mm 40.1 500 487 369 3 4 5.4 4 T-51 Ten-Twenty 39.4 500 534 381 1 2 3.1 4 T-54 2.5 mm 47.0 610 689 581 10 9 10.0 3 Severe lacerations, cuts (15 and 4 mm) in flesh of dummy T-55 Ten-Twenty 45.9 610 1054 585 1 2 2.3 3 T-58 2.5 mm 55.0 710 629 528 6 5 6.0 4 63 and 140 mm tears T-59 Ten-Twenty 54.9 710 1106 689 3 3 4.5 4 *See Tables 6 and 7 for criteria.</page><page sequence="13">3186 S. E. KAY, ET AL. Fig. 16 - TLI as function of velocity by WHAM III test rig A comparison of three methods of rating laceration can be made from the data in Table 5, which includes the WSU, Cor- ning, and TLI scales. The first two are primarily subjective scales in which the degree of laceration in each of the chamois and the PVC simulated tissue are rated subjectively. The TLI scale is an objective rating based upon physical measurements for the range above 2. The subjective WSU scale explained in Table 6 is the lowest of the three, with the Corning scale de- scribed in Table 7 between the WSU and the TLI in most of the ranges. Fairly close correlation prevails between the TLI and the Corning scale. This is not surprising, since the TLI is based upon the Corning scale. Comparison of the laceration of the two types of windshields in Fig. 16 shows the Ten-Twenty windshield to be approxi- mately two units on the TLI scale less than the conventional 2.5 mm annealed windshield over the entire velocity range. Statistical testing shows that this result is significant at the 1% level. Two units on the TLI scale represent a 100-fold de- crease in the number of lacerations of the same depth and length and indicate a substantial improvement in the safety from laceration injury of the windshield. Alternatively, from Fig. 16, it can be seen that the improve- ment is equivalent to about 15 km/h impact velocity. That is, in a barrier crash, the conventional windshield gives a lacera- tion value that would only be achieved by a Ten-Twenty wind- shield at an impact velocity some 1 5 km/h greater. The WHAM III simulations represent barrier collisions in which the severity is equivalent to a head-on collision or a moving-to-stationary car collision with a closing velocity twice that of the WHAM III velocity. For example, the 15 km/h difference of Fig. 16 between the Ten-Twenty and the 2.5 mm conventional wind- shields is the same as a difference of 30 km/h in the closing velocity of two identical cars in a head-on collision. Specifi- cally, an occupant involved in a head-on collision between Fig. 17 - HIC as function of impact velocity by WHAM III test rig Table 6 - WSU Criteria for Rating Laceration Severity Laceration Index Description 0 No lacerations 1 Scratches and abrasions in outer chamois with none completely through it 3 More severe abrasions over large areas of face with small cuts through outer chomois, but not through inner one; abrasions on inner chamois 6 Extensive lacerations through outer chamois with limited abrasions or cuts through inner chamois 10 Severe lacerations through both layers of chamois and cuts in rubber flesh of dummy over extensive facial areas two identical cars equipped with the Ten-Twenty windshield on the average would be expected to receive the same lacera- tion injury as measured on the TLI at a closing velocity of 100 km/h (both cars traveling 50 km/h) as an occupant in the same car equipped with the 2.5 mm conventional windshield would receive at a closing velocity of 70 km/h (both cars traveling 35 km/h). While lacerations are often disfiguring and sometimes present severe cosmetic effects, they are seldom dangerous to life. Consequently, the improvement in laceration must not be achieved at the expense of an increased potential for brain injury. The brain jnjury potential from these experiments is shown in Fig. 17, which is a graph of the HIC index as a func- tion of vehicle velocity. The best-fit, first-order curves for the two types of windshields show that the HIC index for the Ten-</page><page sequence="14">LAMINATED WINDSHIELD WITH REDUCED LACERATION PROPERTIES 3 1 87 Table 7 - Corning Scale Degree Outer Chamois Inner Chamois Rubber Dummy Face 0 None None None 1 -Minimal Abrasions, cuts to 3/4 in, None None none through 2-Minor Abrasions, cuts over 3/4 in, None None none through 3 -Minor As (2) above, but one Abrasions None 3/4 in cut through 4 -Moderate Two or three 3/4 in Cuts, but not through None cuts through 5 -Moderate Unlimited cuts Only one cut through None to 3/4 in 6 -Severe Unlimited cuts Two or three cuts None through to 1-1/2 in 7-Severe Unlimited cuts Unlimited cuts Abrasions 8-Severe Unlimited cuts Unlimited cuts Cuts up to 1/32 in deep and 3/4 in long 9 -Very severe Unlimited cuts Unlimited cuts One cut deeper or longer than (8) 10- Very severe Unlimited cuts Unlimited cuts Numerous cuts worse than (9) Twenty windshield is only approximately 100 units higher at low velocities, and only about 50 units higher at 55 km/h than the 2.5 mm annealed glass windshield. However, it is impor- tant to note that at 56 km/h, both are under 700 while the allowable limit is 1000. The average difference of 75 units is small and is not statistically significant, so it is concluded that the brain injury potential has not been increased measurably by the Ten-Twenty windshield. There is one point on the HIC index graph of Fig. 17 for the Ten-Twenty windshield at 32.2 km/h that needs explaining. The HIC value is 81 1 for run 36 at 32.2 km/h. It appears that this was an extra-strong windshield since it did not fracture at 25.4, 22.5, and 32.2 km/h in runs T-34, T-35, and T-36, respectively. The same windshield did fracture at 39.3 km/h in run T-37 with an HIC index of 543. Even the anomalous HIC value of 81 1 in run T-36 is well below the allowable 1000 level. The HIC indexes for runs T-34-T-37, all from the same windshield, were above the best-fit curve by an appreciable amount. Consequently, this one windshield influenced the position of the HIC curve by an undue amount. Since the greatest laceration and HIC values occur at the higher velocities, comparisons of records at nominally 47 and 55 km/h will be examined. Figs. 18-21 are photographs of the oscillograph records for runs T-54, T-55, T-59, and T-58, re- spectively, for the experimental Ten-Twenty windshield and the 2.5 mm annealed windshield at approximately 47 and 55 km/h. The major difference between the two windshields oc- curs in the initial deceleration spike. Examination of the Gadd SI for head injury shows that the initial peak acceleration attributed to the glass is a major con- tributor to the SI at the 48 and 56 km/h velocities. The initial spike in the case of the Ten-Twenty experimental windshield contributes from seven to ten times as much to the SI as does that of the 2.5 mm. The initial acceleration spike for the Ten- Twenty windshield probably also contributed substantially to the HIC index. However, it should be noted that in all cases, the HIC index, which is the primary indicator of brain injury, is well below the allowable value of 1000, so there appears to be no problem of brain injury with either of the windshields examined. CONCLUSIONS FROM WSU PROGRAM - The conclusions drawn from the experimental investigation of the two types of windshields studied in the WSU program are: 1. The major improvement of the Ten-Twenty experimental windshield is in the decrease of lacerations. 2. The TLI index is two units lower for the experimental windshield than for the production 2.5 mm annealed glass windshield. The magnitude of this improvement is most easily appreciated by the statement that the improvement is the equivalent of a reduction in cuts of a given length and constant depth by 100 to 1. 3. The brain injury potential as measured by the HIC index is not significantly different for the experimental Ten-Twenty windshield than for the production 2.5 mm annealed glass windshields. It is less than 700 at 55 km/h with an allowable level of 1000 according to MVSS 208. 4. The initial anterior-posterior acceleration spike is higher in magnitude and duration for the experimental Ten-Twenty windshield than for the 2.5 mm annealed glass windshield. However, this does not result in excessive HIC numbers. COMPARISON OF RESULTS FROM TRIPLEX AND WSU EVALUATIONS The evaluations carried out by Triplex and by WSU show some differences in absolute values, but they arrive at the same broad conclusions: 1.

E. KAY, ET AL. Fig. 22 - Cone fracture of outer ply of Ten-Twenty windshield conventional annealed glass windshields by about two units on the TLI scale. 2. The lacerative improvement is not counterbalanced by a significant worsening of potential brain injury. 3. At any given impact velocity, the skull impactor gives a higher overall measure of laceration than does the anthropo- morphic dummy test. This is not surprising in view of the ob- vious differences between the testing methods. There is, how- ever, a very close correspondence between the two methods in establishing the difference in lacerative performance of differ- ent products. 4. The HIC values from the drop-test are lower than those obtained from the anthropomorphic dummy. This is partly due to the difference in mass between the dummy head (4.6 kg) and the dropping headform (10 kg), and partly due to the difference in the impact conditions; for example, normal to the glass for the dropping headform, inclined for the anthro- pomorphic dummy. 5. The head acceleration due to the glass is greater in rela- tion to the acceleration due to the interlayer plow-in for the anthropomorphic dummy evaluations. This might be due to the glass being broken by the head before the mass of the dummy torso has been effectively coupled to that of the dum- my head by appreciable neck flexion. In the simple dropping head form test, the effective mass of the impactor is constant during the impact. STONE IMPACT PERFORMANCE, CLIMATIC PROTEC- TION, AND RETENTION OF VISION - Being of a laminated construction, the Ten-Twenty windshield shares the advantages of other laminated windshields in giving protection to the oc- cupant against hostile climatic conditions in the event of glass breakage. The new windshield has several additional advanta- geous features. Fig. 23 - Star fracture of outer ply of Ten-Twenty windshield Outer Glass - The stress in the outer glass of the windshield will to some extent increase its resistance to damage by stone impact. For example, in tests conducted on full-scale wind- shields using the 198 g Z26 dart to simulate the impact of a large, fairly pointed stone on the outer ply, it was found that the Ten-Twenty windshield gave a mean dropping height of 1.2 m to produce fracture of the outer glass compared with 0.7 m for the conventional 3 mm windshield. The level of the stress in the outer ply is such that in the event of its fracture by a stone impact: 1. The glass will not "craze." 2. The cracks that may be produced will not be self-prop- agating. Clarity of vision will therefore be maintained. Typical ex- amples of cone and star fractures caused by external impact on the outer glass are given in Figs. 22 and 23. Inner Glass - The temper of the inner glass gives a good pro- tection against penetration of pebbles through the windshield. The level of stress of the inner glass is also set so as to mini- mize crazing in the unlikely event of the inner pane being broken by a heavy stone impact. An example of such an im- pact (1.4 kg brick at 30 km/h) in which both glasses are frac- tured is given in Fig. 24. It is evident from the above that even if both plies are fractured, the windshield will still protect sat- isfactorily against all hostile climatic conditions, provided the interlayer is not impaired, and adequate visibility will be main- tained. In total performance against stone impact, the critical test is how actual windscreens perform on the road. ,An intensive</page><page sequence="20">LAMINATED WINDSHIELD WITH REDUCED LACERATION PROPERTIES 3 1 93 Fig. 24 - Fracture of both plies of Ten-Twenty windshield by house brick road testing program of the new windshield is being performed at present. Abrasion and Damage in Handling - The thick compressive surface layers of the Ten-Twenty product shown in Fig. 1 make the potentially sensitive glass surfaces relatively insensi- tive to handling damage during the laminating process. A use- ful consequence of the stressed condition of each of the glass plies, both over their major surfaces and also at their edges, is that the finished windshield is robust and is an easier prod- uct for packaging, transport, or final fitting on the car assembly track. Typical edge compression stresses of the inner and outer plies are 70 and 25 MPa, respectively, as compared with about 5-15 MPa for existing commercial products. Sensitivity to Temperature - The properties of the glass plies are hardly affected over the range of temperature experienced in field conditions. It is well known, however, that the tem- perature of the interlayer will markedly affect its performance. The bulk of our testing has, for convenience, been carried out in the region of 20°C. When less temperature-sensitive inter- layer materials become available, the advantages these confer can be directly applied to the Ten-Twenty windshield. The improvement in laceration safety offered by the new wind- shield is not restricted to the use of existing interlayers. Performance Against Standards and Optical Quality - In- house testing of the Ten-Twenty windshield has shown that it can be produced to meet all existing national and the proposed international standards. Actual approvals have been obtained at the time of writing for American Standard Z26.2-1973 and British Standard 857. Applications are pending for German and French approval. Satisfactory optical performance of a windshield depends upon two factors: 1 . The quality of the raw glass. 2. The control of the processing conditions used in making the product. The Ten-Twenty windshield has already been produced to a good commercial standard in which the distortions produced during processing are of the same order subjectively as those present in the raw glass. In-house assessments and those of a few automobile manufacturers who have received trial supplies indicate that the Ten-Twenty windshield can meet all com- mercial standards of performance. MECHANISM OF TEN-TWENTY IMPROVEMENT - The improved laceration characteristics of the Ten-Twenty wind- shield are a consequence of the use of thin-tempered glass for the inner ply, which, under head impact conditions, fractures to produce small glass fragments. This fine fracture is due to the release of the energy stored in the glass at the instant of fracture. Some of this energy is stored in the glass by virtue of the tempering and some is the strain energy stored transiently in the glass by the bending of the glass ply under the impact. The fine glass fracture reduces the size of the cutting particles and hence tends to reduce the depth to which cutting is liable to occur. The individual particles are also less sharp and there- fore less liable to cut- a familiar property of tempered glass. The fine fracture across the full depth of the windshield en- sures that a greater area of the windshield is able to yield flex- ibly as the head impacts and passes down the windshield. In the case of conventional windshields, only a very small area of the glass is finely fractured by the head impact, and the head then has to traverse larger pieces, which have sharp cutting edges and which more rigidly oppose the motion of the head. The good performance in terms of SI and HIC is a conse- quence of using a thin glass tempered in such a way that it has a large amount of strain energy but still with only a moderate modulus of rupture. The moderate increase in modulus of rupture compared with annealed glass constructions is offset by the reduced thickness of glass used in the construction of the new windshield. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Impact performance of an improved laminated windshield known as Ten-Twenty has been described. It is comprised of two layers of 2.3 mm soda-lime float glass, the inner ply ther- mally stressed to a center tensile stress of 47 ± 3 MPa, and a standard 0.76 mm HPR PVB interlayer. It is a much safer automobile windshield than those now in commercial use due to decreased laceration to the occupants during a collision and without penalty to other product properties such as concus- sion, optics, stone damage, etc. The following conclusions are based upon the evaluation programs at Triplex and WSU: 1 . The TLI is 2 and 2.7 units less for the Ten-Twenty wind- shield than for the 2.5 and 3.0 mm conventional windshields, respectively, on the skull impact rig.</page><page sequence="21">3194 S. E. KAY, ET AL. 2. The TLI is 2 units less for the Ten-Twenty windshield than for the 2.5 mm conventional windshield on the WHAM III simulator. This represents a decrease in laceration equiv- alent to: (a) A 99% reduction in the number of cuts when the length and depth of cuts remain unaltered. (b) A 90% reduction in the length of cuts when the number and depth of cuts remain unaltered. (c) A change in depth of cuts from one layer of skin simula- tion to another, but in particular, a 78.5% reduction in the depth of cuts into the PVC base layer when the number and length of cuts remain unaltered. In a severe impact, all three types of damage occur, and the improvement is made up of contributions from all three sources. In terms of impact velocity for the barrier crash sim- ulation, a conventional windshield gives a laceration value that is only achieved by a Ten-Twenty windshield at a barrier im- pact velocity some 15 km/h greater. In terms of actual road accidents, this may be interpreted as an advantage of about 30 km/h closing speed in car-to-car collisions. 3. The TLI is higher for the skull impactor test than for the anthropomorphic dummy on WHAM III test, but the dif- ference of two units between the Ten-Twenty and the 2.5 mm commercial windshield is obtained with both test methods. 4. The initial or glass anterior-posterior acceleration spike is higher in magnitude for the Ten-Twenty windshield than for the 2.5 mm commercial windshield, but the HIC is well below the allowable value of 1000 for both types of windshields with approximately the same HIC values. 5. The Ten-Twenty windshield has greater resistance to stone breakage or stone penetration than the commercial windshields. 6. Stone impact does not cause loss of visibility through excessive crazing. 7. The optical properties of the Ten-Twenty windshield meet the current and proposed commercial, national, and international standards. 8. The thick compressive surface and edge stress of the Ten- Twenty windshield should reduce breakage during fabrication, shipping, and installation. 9. The improvement of laceration characteristics of the Ten- Twenty windshield is achieved without degradation of other required features. REFERENCES 1 . H. M. Alexander, P. T. Mattimoe, and J. J.
