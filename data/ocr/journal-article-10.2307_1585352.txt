<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRIESTHOOD IN JOSHUA TO KINGS by J.G. McCONVILLE Cheltenham In scholarly interpretation of the meaning of the Deuteronomistic History (DtrH), the accent has largely fallen on the attitude of the au- thor or authors (Dtr) to the monarchy. As a result, the topic of priest- hood in DtrH has often been neglected as a theme in its own right. A habit of regarding material that reflected priestly interests as some- how intrusive to the historical books is well established. Literary critics tended to think that texts such as 1 Sam. vi 15 and 2 Sam. xv 24, which carefully record that the Levites handled the ark of the cove- nant, betray the harmonization of old narratives to later practice and belief.' And the tradition criticism of M. Noth supposed that priestly elements were residues that Dtr could not help but preserve, though he had no intrinsic interest in them. Indeed, "(Dtr) likes to confer upon cult objects a significance not strictly speaking cultic, as well as indi- cating [he concedes] their original and actual function".2 Dtr's atti- tude, furthermore, was not merely driven by force of circumstance, rather: "he did not see the end of regulated cult as any great loss".3 His portrayal of ark, temple and sacrifice follow naturally from this view.4 While other views, notably that of G. von Rad, have been more positive,5 and some modern studies have brought new perspectives to bear, as we shall notice, Noth's appraisal continues to be influential. The most interesting recent contribution has come from R.D. Nelson, 'J. Wellhausen, Prolegomena to the History of Israel (Edinburgh, 1885), pp. 128, 141- 42 = Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels (Berlin, 1883), pp. 132, 146-47; cf. P.K.

McCONVILLE who adopts a modified version of Noth's position.6 The present article is in some respects a response to his. Nelson notes several features of Dtr's positive interest in priests. First, there are elements of priestly theology in, for example, Solomon's dedicatory prayer (at 1 Kgs viii 10-11) and at 2 Kgs xvi 15. Second, priests appear in the narrative from beginning (Deut. xxxi 9) to end (2 Kgs xxv 18).7 Third, Dtr distinguishes between priests and Levites.8 And fourth, he identifies 1 Sam. ii 27-36 and 2 Kgs xxiii 5-9 as key passages for the topic.9 However, Dtr's interest in priesthood should not be exaggerated, in Nelson's view. Despite Dtr's intervention in the promissory oracle at 1 Sam. ii 35, shifting the expectation towards a whole priestly family (and away from Samuel) as Eli's successor, he shows no genealogical interest in Zadok.'? Eli and Zadok, in the end, merely "serve as redactional pointers to what is really important to Dtr, namely, divine dynastic promise and royal obedience and dis- obedience"." In the account of Josiah's treatment of priests (2 Kgs xxiii 5-9), while Dtr distinguishes five different categories of them, he is merely working out the effects of the reform.12 Nelson's position is thus significantly different from that of Noth. This is not surprising, given that in his view Dtr is Josianic, while for Noth he was exilic. It must make a difference whether Dtr was writ- ing at a time when the royal priestly cultic establishment was flourishing, and appeared to have a golden future, or at a time when it had been destroyed, perhaps for ever. Yet the question of dating is not the only factor. It may be asked whether Dtr would have considered the reli- gious traditions associated with Jerusalem to have been entirely bound up with the Davidic dynasty, as R.E. Clements has well pointed out: "... the Deuteronomic equivocation regarding the Davidic kingship contrasts rather unexpectedly with its wholehearted commitment to Jerusalem as the chosen sanctuary after events that had so seriously damaged the reputation of both institutions".'3 If the status ofJerusalem 6 R.D.

Reimer (eds.), After the Exile: Essays in 74</page><page sequence="3">PRIESTHOOD IN JOSHUA TO KINGS remains open in DtrH, presumably that of the priests, hitherto strongly associated with the temple city, does so also. Systematic analyses of priests and priesthood in DtrH, however, are lacking.'4 There is a case, therefore, for returning to the question whether Dtr was interested in priests and priesthood as such. In what follows I intend to examine the topic in the books that compose DtrH. In doing so I take a cue from Nelson, who said (as we noted) that priests appear from the beginning to the end of the corpus. I also fol- low, with qualifications, the convention that DtrH constitutes a distinct literary entity. However, it would be misleading, as Nelson also noted, to expect complete congruity between "deuteronomic" and "deuteron- omistic" points of view, for that would allow the latter no scope for development or response to new factors. In support of this point it may be observed that the historical books draw their theological impetus not only from Deuteronomy, but from other parts of the Pentateuchal material.'5 The Philistines, in their alarm at the arrival of the ark on the field, recall the power of "the gods" at the exodus from Egypt (1 Sam. iv 7-8, cf. Num. x 33-36), and are subsequently themselves cast in the role of Pharaoh (1 Sam. vi 6). In the same context the motif of the "glory" of God occurs, borrowed from the presence theology of Exodus-Numbers (1 Sam. iv 21-22; cf. Exod. xxiv 16-17; xxxiii 22; Num. xiv 10, 21-22; xvii 7 [xvi 42EVV]). There is in this passage, therefore, a cluster of ideas (ark, exodus, land, Yahweh war, glory of God) that the Dtr narrative appears to share with that of the older traditions. The belief that such features might simply be residual in DtrH is weakened by the fact that the traits in common with the narrative of Exodus-Numbers are so carefully Honour of Rex Mason (Macon GA, 1996), pp. 5-25, here p. 24, and see also p. 25. I have elsewhere disputed this alleged attachment of Dtr to Jerusalem as such, in J.G. McConville and J.G. Millar, Time and Place in Deuteronomy (Sheffield, 1994). 14 EJ. Revell has made interesting observations from a novel angle in The Designation of the Individual: Expressive Usage in Biblical Narrative (Kampen, 1996). He considers the relationship between designations and narrative intent in Judges, Samuel and Kings, the term "priest" being one important case. Certain usages can show, for example, that a particular character is deemed to show too little respect for the priest; see pp. 158, 161. He does not offer a sustained interpretation of Dtr's view of priesthood, however. 15 For the connections between Exodus and Samuel see R.E. Friedman, "From Egypt to Egypt", in B. Halpern and J. Levenson (eds.), Traditions in Transformation (Winona Lake, IN, 1981), pp. 167-92; B. Peckham, The Composition of the Deuteronomistic History (Atlanta, 1985). 75</page><page sequence="4">J.G. McCONVILLE drawn. J. Van Seters has elaborated such connections, and commented specifically on the notion of "Yahweh in our midst" as a motif com- mon to the Zion-theology, the holy war and Deuteronomy.16 He has also noticed echoes of the miracle at the crossing of the Sea (Exod. xiv) in both Josh. x 6-11 and 1 Sam. vii 7-10.17 And on priesthood in particular, B. Peckham has commented: "(Dtr) ascribes to individual priests, from Aaron to Hilkiah, a dominant role in the history of the nation". 1 We proceed now to the books of DtrH. The theme of those books has often been stated in terms of Israel's leaders, interpreted as judges and kings. But is it possible to discern a separate story, and theology, of priesthood and its associated theme of divine presence? Priesthood in the Book of oshua While it is usually supposed that there are priestly additions to the Dtr narrative of Joshua, it is clear that the role of priests and ark is firmly embedded in it.19 Noth thought that Dtr, having found the ark in the older accounts, actually added some verses "emphasising the leading role of this sacred object".20 This emphasis is created by the repeated characterization of the priests as "the bearers of the ark". In Noth's view, Dtr also introduced the priests in the story of the con- quest of Jericho (Josh. vi 6a), both as ark-bearers and as those in charge of the trumpet-blowing.21 Finally in this connection, he added the note about the ark (and thus necessarily the priests) to the covenant ceremony in Josh. viii 30-35.22 This activity of the priests, therefore, not only marks the ark out as holy, but by the same token, shows that Dtr holds cultic matters and the priestly role in them to be very significant. The priests' bearing of the ark is part of the larger themes of divine 16 J.

In this connection the parallel between the crossing of the Jordan and that of the Sea in Exodus becomes important. The ark, indeed, prob- ably functions in a similar way to the pillar of cloud and fire in that book.23 The crossing into the land (iv 13), the capture of Jericho (vi 8, 13, 26), the tribes' casting of lots for the land at Shiloh (xviii 6, 8, 10; xix 51), and their meeting at Shechem for the covenant renewal (xxiv 1) all happen "before Yahweh" and/or "before the ark of Yahweh". (In Noth's scheme Josh. xiii-xxii is all post-Dtr, but close to Dtr in outlook. Nelson appears to suppose that these chapters are Dtr.)24 The association between ark, priests and presence emerges from these texts. The "tent" theme, often seen as separate from the ark, appears in Josh. xviii. The expression "before Yahweh" spans both these themes; it is also characteristic of both Deuteronomy and P (cf. Deut. xii 7; Exod. xxviii 29-30; Lev. i 3, 5, 11). A further mark of the importance of the priests in Joshua concerns their exclusion from an inheritance of tribal territory on the grounds of their priesthood (Josh. xiii 14, 33; xiv 3; xviii 7; xxi), a theme that is highlighted at the beginning of the distribution (2x), and in the Shiloh section. Joshua may be said to be closer to Deuteronomy than to P on this topic (Deut. x 9; xviii 2; cf. Num. xviii 23-24),25 because it preserves the concerns of Deut. x 9 (in the same order), namely: i) the Levites bear the ark (in Num. xviii, Levites are not expressly bearers of the ark), ii) they have no land inheritance. It uses a term for priest- hood, however, that is more typical of priestly texts (but not exclu- sively), namely kehunnd (Josh. xviii 7; cf. Exod. xxix 9; xl 15; Num. iii 10; xvi 10; xviii 1, 7; Ezra ii 62; but also 1 Sam. ii 36; [Num. xxv 13]). Here too, DtrH has its own clear rationale for the priesthood. The concept that the priestly tribe has no inheritance because of its service at the altar may be said to constitute an exalted view of their role.26 23 Cf. T.W. Mann, "The Pillar of Cloud in the Red Sea Narrative", JBL 90 (1971), pp. 15-39, especially pp. 24-27. Van Seters attributes the similarities between Joshua and Exodus in this respect to the Yahwist (Life of Moses, pp. 143-145). 24 Noth, p. 40 (German, p. 45); Nelson, p. 133. 25 It is not certain whether the phrase "as he promised them" (Deut. xviii 2) is an allusion to Num. xviii; see S.R. Driver, Deuteronomy (Edinburgh, 1895), pp. 214-215. 26 For the Levites' exclusion from territory in an ancient Near Eastern setting, see G. Ahlstrom, Royal Administration and National Religion in Ancient Palestine (Leiden, 1982), pp. 7-8. 77</page><page sequence="6">J.G. McCONVILLE Priesthood in the Book of Judges The priesthood is not at all prominent in the Book of Judges, texts concerning it being confined to the closing section, Judg. xvii-xxi. Noth regarded these chapters as post-Dtr,27 but more recent studies have tended to show that they are firmly integrated into the storyline and message of the book, and they are now widely regarded as Dtr.28 In the two stories of religious decline in these chapters, though they are clearly interested in kingship, priestly and cultic matters play a part. Israel is constituted as a cultic assembly in the Benjaminite war, as the terms of Judg. xx 1 make clear (wattiqqahel hd'edd, cf. Num. xvi 3; xvii 7 [EVV xvi 42]; xx 2; Josh. xviii 1; xxii 12; 1 Kgs viii 1-3).29 Fur- thermore, both Jerusalem and Shiloh make entrances here. Jerusalem, as Jebus, is mentioned more or less in passing as a "city of foreigners" (xix 12), recalling incidentally the failure of Benjamin to possess it recorded in the prologue (i 21).30 Shiloh appears unobtrusively at the conclusion of each of the two stories. In xviii 31 the cult of "Micah's idol", served by the priesthood derived presumably from the Levite appointed by him (xvii 7-13; xviii 30), is made co-extensive with the time during which "the house of God was at Shiloh". This strikes an important Dtr theme, namely that Shiloh was for a period the one sanctuary for all Israel (1 Sam. i-iii; Jer. vii 12). The priesthood of the Danites is thus criticized in terms that are precisely Dtr, and which depicts the rotten state of Israel by the use of those categories. If there is a parody of the holy war in the Danites' slaughter of the unsuspect- ing people of Laish, it may be that their venal priesthood also parodies the true priesthood that once bore the ark into the land. The second story finishes with a cameo of the annual festival of Yahweh at Shiloh, at which a measure of restoration between Israel 27 Noth, p. 121, n. 29 (German, p. 54, n. 2). 28 R. Boling includes Judg. xvi l-xviii 31 within his "Deuteronomic" framework, and xix l-xxi 25 in his "Deuteronomistic" one, in Judges (New York, 1975), pp. 30, 258- 259, 278. B. Lindars' view (as reconstructed by A.D.H. Mayes' Introduction to his incomplete commentary) was that the stories of Judg. xvii-xxi, in common with the other stories in the book, were compiled by DtrG, with additions in chs. xx-xxi. "The concluding stories prepare the ground for the rise of monarchy in Samuel": Judges 1-5: a Translation and Commentary (Edinburgh, 1995), pp. vii-viii. 29 While in the Numbers passages the term is used of the tribes gathering together against Moses, it is in Joshua, Judges and Kings that it is used of cultic assembling, arguably therefore a Dtr usage. 30 See D.W. Gooding, "The Composition ofJudges", Eretz-Israek Archaeological, Historical and Geographic Studies 16 (1982), pp. 7-79; here pp. 77-78. 78</page><page sequence="7">PRIESTHOOD IN JOSHUA TO KINGS and Benjamin is achieved by the provision of wives for the Benjaminites from the daughters of that region (xxi 15-24). Together the two stories prepare for the next phase of DtrH, in which the Shiloh temple and the priesthood of Eli will play an important role. If the "regular" Shiloh priesthood remains firmly behind the scenes in Judges, the tale of the Danites' priesthood and the allusions to the worship of Yahweh at Shiloh at least raise the question as to its character and condition. It may finally be noted that the ark is mentioned once in Judges, parenthetically, at xx 27-28. Its location at Bethel, and the mention of Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, sits oddly with the view offered otherwise in these chapters of a cult at Shiloh. Its bracketing out of the main line of the narrative signifies in any case a significant negligence on the part of the Israel of the day. While Dtr's theology of priesthood is not fully or explicitly worked out in Judges, an ideal view of its role as an institution may be said to be present in the background, hinted at by its "shadowside" in priestly corruption. Priesthood in the Books of Samuel In Samuel, the cradle of the new monarchic society is Eli's Shiloh. Samuel himself is the harbinger of monarchy (1 Sam. ii 10), and the plenipotentiary who has the authority to sacrifice where the fledgling king Saul has not (1 Sam. x 8). The child Samuel himself "ministers to the LORD" (mesdrt'etyhwh; ii 11), a term reserved almost exclusively for priestly activity (in both P and Deuteronomy, cf. Num. iii 6, 31; Deut. x 8; xvii 12).31 The corruption of Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, leads to the downfall of their house, and to the promise of another "faithful priest" (1 Sam. ii 27-36), in a passage of the drama that echoes the yielding of the judges to the kings. A scion of Eli, Ahijah, is still priest in the time of Saul (1 Sam. xiv 3); and the house must still suffer that king's ire at Nob (1 Sam. xxi).32 In this agony of the priestly family the fate of the ark is also at stake, captured by the Philistines, and lamented in a presage of exile (1 Sam. iv 21-22; see above). This ark is no mere box, as the Philistines, and then Uzzah, 31 Its occurrences are largely in P, Deuteronomy, Ezekiel and the Chronicler; how- ever, it appears in a number of passages in DtrH in its sense of cultic service (1 Sam. ii 11, 18; iii 1; 1 Kgs viii 11; 2 Kgs xxv 14). 32 I take the priests at Nob to be related to the house of Eli; note that the name Ahimelech is common to Nob and the family of Abiathar (1 Sam. xxi 1; 2 Sam. viii 17). 79</page><page sequence="8">J.G. McCONVILLE discovered to their cost. The view of it in these texts is highly cultic, as shown, for example, by 1 Sam. iv 4, "the ark of the covenant of YHWH-Sebaoth who sits [on] the cherubim" (echoing Exod. xxv 22). 1 Sam. vi also brings in the "glory" theme (associated with the "tent", incidentally); and as we have noted already, the exodus is in the back- ground of the narrative here (1 Sam. iv-vi; e.g. iv 7). In 2 Samuel the relationship between king and priest is established. The uneasy balance of power between Zadok and Ahimelech (son of Abiathar), may reflect David's concern to commend himself to both northern and southern populations. These, together with David's sons, officiate as priests (2 Sam. viii 15-18). Zadok and Abiathar play an important role in the story of Absalom's rebellion, staying in the city with the ark, while David is forced to flee (2 Sam. xv). In this tense situation, the priests mediate between the absentee monarch and key players in the story (2 Sam. xvii 15; xix 11-12). Part of the dramatic tension of this story consists in the presence of the ark in the capital, while the king is forced to be absent. There is a dissonance within the intimate triangle of king, priest and ark, and between priest and priest, which may be said to be resolved finally when Zadok anoints Solomon (1 Kgs i 39). The priestly affinities of the narrative in 2 Samuel emerge not only from the storyline, but also from the categories of religious purity which can be discerned in the story of David and Bathsheba, as D.P. Wright has shown.33 In Samuel, the story of the priesthood undergoes its first substantial development since Joshua. In line with that book it proceeds in close association with the ark and the holy war.34 But in addition it now becomes fatefully entwined with the story of kingship. Priesthood in the Books of Kings There are a number of aspects to the theme of the priesthood in Kings: 1) the continuing story of Zadok, 2) priestly elements in the 33 David P. Wright, "David Autem Remansit in Hierusalem: Felix Coniunctio!" in D.P. Wright, D.N. Freedman and Avi Hurvitz (eds.), Pomegranates and Golden Bells: Studies in Biblical, Jewish and Near Eastern Ritual, Law and Literature in Honor of Jacob Milgrom (Winona Lake IN, 1995), pp. 215-30. 34 H.-D. Preuss has noted a predominance of the language of "going/being with" (i.e. God with Israel) in Joshua and Samuel, in "'... ich will mit dir sein"', ZAW 80 (1968), pp. 139-173, here p. 140. This concentration is not surprising as these are the two great books of transition in DtrH. 80</page><page sequence="9">PRIESTHOOD IN JOSHUA TO KINGS construction and dedication of the temple, 3) the priests appointed by Jeroboam, and 4) the role of Jehoiada and Joash in the deposing of Queen Athaliah. 1. With the rustication of Abiathar, the prophecy against Eli is now fulfilled (1 Kgs ii 22, 26-27, 35; cf. 1 Sam. ii 27-30 [v. 27]). The family of Zadok now seems foremost in the king's household (1 Kgs iv 2- note "the priest", recalling the title of Eli, 1 Sam. i 9; ii 11). The close interdependence of king and priest is nowhere more evident than in Zadok's leading role in Solomon's accession (1 Kgs i 38-40), where Samuel's prerogative of anointing the king has devolved primarily upon the priest, though the prophet Nathan is not forgotten (vv. 43-45). Nelson's observation that Dtr shows no interest in the genealogy of Zadok should be counterbalanced by the importance of his role in the narrative, to which we shall return. 2. The building of the temple (1 Kgs vi-vii) has certain evident simi- larities with that of the tabernacle in Exod. xxv-xxxi. As the temple plays an important role in the narrative of the fall of Judah, it is natu- ral enough to suppose that DtrH simply draws on priestly theology at this point.35 As priests attended the procession of the ark into the holy land (Joshua), so they accompany it to its resting place in the Jerusalem temple. Of the frame-narrative surrounding the story of the dedication of the temple (1 Kgs viii 1-13, 62-66), culminating in sacrifices and a feast, J. Walsh observes that it has woven together a number of theological traditions, including some associated with the exodus from Egypt (the Tent of Meeting, the tablets in the ark [v. 9; Deut. x 1-5] and the cloud signifying God's presence), and others connected with David (procession with the ark [2 Sam. vi 1-15], the holy vessels [v. 4, cf. vii 51b], and the relationship between Yahweh and David [v. 66]);36 he notes additionally the use of the verb ysb, possibly "sit enthroned", not "dwell" (v. 13).37 The tension arising from past failed attempts to bring the ark are thus now resolved here (1 Sam. iv-vi; 2 Sam. vi). 35 V.A. Hurowitz, "Solomon's Golden Vessels (1 Kings 7:48-50) and the Cult of the First Temple", in Wright, Freedman and Hurvitz (eds.), Pomegranates and Golden Bells, pp. 151-64, has argued that the cult presupposed by Dtr here is not identical with that of P, but reflects the practice of the Solomonic temple which P actually reformed. The former, especially as exemplified by 1 Kgs vii 48-50, was "somewhat richer, a bit more complex, and perhaps slightly more anthropomorphic than the cult of P" (p. 164). He does not directly assess Dtr's view of cult however. 36 Jerome Walsh, Bent Olam: Studies in Hebrew Narrative and Poetry: 1 Kings (Collegeville, 1996), p. 112. 37 Walsh, pp. 111-12. 81</page><page sequence="10">J.G. McCONVILLE The inclusion of the framework of 1 Kgs viii, of course, begs the question of the view of priesthood and divine presence in the book, and thus the whole question under examination here. The key to the interpretation of 1 Kgs viii is almost always found in the so-called "name-theology", thought by many to signify a desacralizing tendency here and in the deuteronomic literature generally. In line with this thinking, 1 Kgs viii 9, 21 are often regarded as additions to an older text (i.e. vv. 1-13), reversing the thrust of it by introducing the idea of the ark as a mere box. Nelson thought Dtr introduced these passages because he saw the ark as a threat to the reform.38 However, this approach merely poses the question of Dtr's attitude to cultic things, rather than answering it. Nelson, in fact, shows some ambivalence about this, when he cites 1 Kgs viii 10-11 among priestly texts that are included within DtrH; yet when he says that these verses occur "within (Dtr's) predominantly Deuteronomistic presentation" it seems that he wishes at the same time to adhere to a definition of Dtr as non-priestly.39 In my view it is better to consider the narrative tendency of the whole first, as Walsh has done. In that case, v. 9 can hardly have the force to reverse the thrust of a passage whose whole point is cultic/ sacral. Walsh, then, is right to say that v. 9 is part of the narrator's bringing together of Exodus and David themes. Its comment on the ark containing only tablets is best understood as a reaffirmation of the Old Testament's prohibition of the imaging of Yahweh. As for the significance of the "name", it is sufficient to find in it an assertion of Yahweh's freedom in spite of the change from tent to temple.40 3) Jeroboam's apostasy, which becomes paradigmatic for the sins of the northern kings, involves the appointment of his own priests as a direct challenge to the priesthood in Jerusalem (1 Kgs xiii 33), and shows clearly that he has departed from the main line of the story of the Davidic promise. Dtr's condemnation ofJeroboam raises the ques- tion whether Dtr is actually an apologist for the Jerusalem priesthood. In fact his view is more subtle, as will appear from a consideration of the next point. 4) The reform of religion under Joash is in my view one of the key passages for the present topic. The most striking aspect of the narra- 38 Nelson, The Double Redaction of the Deuteronomistic History (Sheffield, 1981), p. 124. 39 Nelson, "The Role of the Priesthood", p. 132. 40 Walsh, p. 113. 82</page><page sequence="11">PRIESTHOOD IN JOSHUA TO KINGS tive of it is the centrality of the priest Jehoiada, who, together with a whole contingent of cultic officials, re-establishes the kingship on right lines (2 Kgs xi-xii). The point may be supported by noticing the fre- quency of the term "priest". The word itself (hakkjohn) occurs in vv. 4 (some versions), 9[2x], 10, 15[2x], 18. Three times Jehoiada is referred to simply as "the priest" (vv. 10, 15, 18), recalling both Eli and Azariah, son of Zadok (1 Sam. i 9; 1 Kgs iv 2). This narrative device emphasizes the priest's control of events. The action, furthermore, occurs largely in the temple, which func- tions not just as a hiding place, but in all its character as a holy place. The term bt yhwh, or sometimes just bayit, "house", is repeated sev- eral times (vv. 3, 4, 10, 11[3x], 13, 15). There are other important spatial indicators: the temple guard, with its times and divisions, guard- ing the king on four sides (vv. 5-8, 11; cf. Num. i 53); the double pro- cession from temple to palace, first for the execution of Athaliah, which must not happen in the holy place (v. 16), then for the enthronement ofJoash (v. 19); and the contrast between "the house" and the "house of Baal", as between "the priest" and the "priest of Baal" (v. 18). Indeed, as Burke O. Long has shown, the idea of "cultic geography" dominates the chapter. The spatial structure keeps apart "life" and "death" spheres; Joash's secret hideaway becomes public, sacred space, investing him with legitimacy, and at the same time denying it to Athaliah; "the solemnity and special vocabulary used for the occasion hint at a traditional association of royal and priestly power that invests state occasions with transcendent authority".41 The world is arranged into the holy over against the profane; Athaliah the Omride is classified as "outside". At her entry into the temple, the youngJoash is stationed "by the pillar, according to the custom" (v. 14). The nature of the cus- tom is not specified, but the phrase asserts at least that there has ever been a properly ordained way of making kings in Israel (cf. again 1 Kgs i 38-40), and that Athaliah has never had a part in the Judahite royal-sacral process. The procession of Joash into the king's house brings it inside the holy sphere, though it was carefully kept outside up to and including the death of Athaliah.42 Of the other cultic vocabulary in the chapter the most noteworthy is the term 'edut (v. 12), which the priest confers upon the king as part 41 B.O.

McCONVILLE of the ritual of his coronation. If this refers to the "book of the law", as Nelson thinks,43 it is an interesting echo of Exod. xxv 16 (P) where the term occurs in the same sense, in preference to the formula used in 2 Kgs xxii 8. Alternatively it may refer to some symbolic insignia, showing the king is entrusted with responsibility for the keeping of the covenantal law.44 In any case, the transaction occurs between king and priest, and thus belongs to the essential concept of this passage. This extraordinarily elaborate narrative of the relationship between king and priest at the youngJoash's coronation contrasts strikingly with the story of Josiah's reform. The two events are not, of course, pre- cisely similar in kind; Joash is a young king under protection, and his religious reform is at the same time a coronation. Nevertheless, the echoes between the two passages should not be missed. The priest Hilkiah plays a part in Josiah's Reform; the temple is repaired; there are arrangements for paying the workers; there is a renewal of covenant, at which Josiah "stands by the pillar" (xxiii 3), as did Joash, and Baal worship is destroyed. The significance of the chapter has not always been appreciated, however, because, in my view, the emphasis in studies of DtrH has fallen too heavily on Josiah. For example, H.-D. Hoffmann has noticed the parallels between the two reforms in question, as part of his excel- lent account of the books of Kings. In his view both Jehoiada and Josiah are perfect models of Dtr's demand for cult reform as a require- ment of the covenant.45 However, his comparison is too much domi- nated by his thesis that Josiah's reform is the climax of the theme of reform in Kings, and as such is the sum of all the preceding.46 This fails to notice the exceptional character of the reform of Jehoiada. In fact, the differences between the two accounts are as important as the similarities. Hilkiah is a more passive figure than Jehoiada; it is Josiah who commands here.47 In the comparison between the two 43 Nelson, p. 144. N. Lohfink also allows that the term may at one time have referred to the covenant document, but thinks there is insufficient evidence to decide, in "'d(w)t im Deuteronomium und in den K6nigsbiichern", BZ 35 (1991), p. 91. Other cultic terms in the chapter include nezer (Exod. xxix 6), msh (Lev. xxi 12) and pequddot (Num. iii 32, 36). 44 Long, pp. 235-236. 45 H.-D.

From 2 Kgs xi he cites at this point only v. 17. 47 N. Lohfink showed how the narrative in 2 Kings xxii-xxiii foregrounded the king by its repetition of the phrases "the king sent" and "the king commanded", in "Die Bundesurkunde des Konigs Josia", Biblica 44 (1963), pp. 270-71. 84</page><page sequence="13">PRIESTHOOD IN JOSHUA TO KINGS passages the fact that a priest dominates in one and a king in the other should not be underestimated. Yet where Josiah's reform is held to be the climax of the main edition of DtrH this point is usually missed. On that hypothesis, the possibility can easily be overlooked that the process in 2 Kgs xxii-xxiii is exposed to unfavourable scrutiny by the earlier narrative. The force of the contrast might be dimin- ished by supposing that the cultic worldview of 2 Kgs xi-xii has been superimposed by an interested party.48 Yet this does not explain the echoes between the two chapters, and the question remains why the Joash narrative has been selected to place the king carefully in rela- tion to the religious establishment. If the account of Josiah's reform may be deposed from its customary position as the climax of the whole narrative of Kings, it is possible to elevate in its place the Joash nar- rative, as the classic statement in the book of the true nature of both royal and priestly authority. It remains to ask, however, what is implied in the course of the story of the priests in DtrH. After Jehoiada, "the priest" never again plays so glorious a role. Rather, the institution seems to roll with the ups and downs of the monarchy. Under Ahaz, "the priest Uriah did everything that King Ahaz commanded" (2 Kgs xvi 10-16)! We have noted Hilkiah's muted role. The story of the priesthood is now, in fact, subordinate to that of the kings. As the kings fall, so must they. The final scene of Kings portrays the fate of Seraiah, the "high priest" (kohen hdros), together with that of a "second priest", three temple guards, and other officials of the royal household (xxv 18-21). Here there seems to be a recognition of the pre-eminence of the priest in the Judahite royal establishment. The execution of these leading figures, headed by the senior priests, is the last nail in the coffin of the kingdom of Judah (as indicated by the note of completion implied by 2 Kgs xxv 21b). But the significance of the fall of the priesthood cannot be evaluated apart from the attitude of Dtr to the royal-priestly synthesis that has developed as a function of the history of Judah. Conclusions Priests and priesthood play an important role in the Dtr narrative of Joshua to Kings, which draws also on themes in Exodus-Numbers. 48 So, for example, G. Garbini, "David nella storiagrafa dei libri storici (Sam-Re)" RSB 7 (1995), pp. 17-33, who thinks that third-century priestly authors overlaid the Dtr traditions. 85</page><page sequence="14">J.G. McCONVILLE While the topic surfaces in different ways in the books, it has a role in the narrative as a whole that may be seen as a function of Dtr's interests, rather than as residual or incidental. The priests' role as ark- bearers, for example, is widely accepted to be a concern of Dtr. They are also present at other key moments in the establishment of Israel's religious life (Josh. viii 33; 1 Kgs viii). In Samuel and Kings the roles of priest and king become closely associated. In the reform of Joash (2 Kgs xi-xii), the priestJehoiada represents faithfulness to the covenant, and exemplifies the relationship between priest and king. Hilkiah plays a minor role in Josiah's reform, and the priests are involved in the final ejection ofJudah from its land. The interpretation offered here takes 2 Kgs xi to be a key text, with its priestly and cultic language and imagery. The respective roles ofJehoiada and the young KingJoash in the religious reform presided over by the former are contrasted with that of King Josiah in his reform, and it is suggested that Josiah's role as chief executive of the cult is implicitly criticized by the narrative in 2 Kgs xi. It is further suggested that the importance of priesthood to Dtr has been obscured by the belief that Dtr presents Josiah as the culmination of the story of covenant faithfulness. This means that Dtr has an intrinsic interest in priesthood, rather than merely using it as a redactorial device to further his interest in the theme of kingship. The question follows whether Dtr entertains any hope for the future of the priesthood. This seems inseparable from the question of the future of the monarchy, which looks bleak. But it is not necessarily the same. If the priesthood finishes by being com- pletely bound up with the monarchy it was not always so-there was no king in the days of Moses and Joshua. What fails in Kings is a synthesis, namely the Davidic royal cult. By definition the monarchy stands condemned for its failure. So does the priesthood inasfar as it has become assimilated to a specific concept of kingship in relation to covenant, cult and people. There are narrative factors at play in DtrH in which silences are conspicuous. The retreat of the ark from view afterJehoiada, for example, may be an ominous measure of the increas- ing helplessness ofJudah to avoid its destiny in degradation and sub- jugation.49 The absence of a genealogy for Zadok may be read in the 49 This seems to me to be a better approach to the material than to attribute the sudden diminuendo of a theme or motif to the intervention of a different hand. I have made a similar point elsewhere regarding the silencing of the "lamp for David" motif; 86</page><page sequence="15">PRIESTHOOD IN JOSHUA TO KINGS same way; if priesthood has a future it may not, after all, lie with the house that became so closely involved with David. And thus even the promise of 1 Sam. ii 35 has only a limited scope. For Dtr, priesthood is bigger than the Davidic synthesis of palace and temple. When it falls into Babylonian exile, it is the end of a chap- ter in its story. But in Dtr's open-ended history, there is no obituary for priesthood as such.

McKenzie, The Trouble With Kings (Leiden, 1991), p. 127, who has argued that the regression of the themes of David, centralization and bdmdt signifies the work of another author in the closing stages of Kings. 87</page></plain_text>
