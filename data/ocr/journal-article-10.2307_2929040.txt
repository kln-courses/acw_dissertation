<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHELINE HERZ Tragedy, Poetry and the Burlesque in Ghelderode's Theatre At every level, including the level of appearance, Michel de Ghelderode's theatre abounds in burlesque elements. There is nothing glorious about his men, nor about his women either. However up- setting some people may find this, it is clear that Ghelderode him- self, as manifested in his plays, reveled in such an atmosphere. Monsters and misshapen beings accost us at every turn. Women, apart from a few saints and other privileged creatures, tend to be fiftyish, ample as to breast and buttock, with a gash by way of a mouth and peroxide hair: typical residents of a low-grade brothel. Their names are evocative: Salivaine, Visquosine, Creme, Chose, Boule, Olympia, Aurora, Venuska, and so forth. The more or less normal creatures in this feminine galaxy (Armande in Sortie de l'acteur or Emmanuele in La Farce des tenebreux) remind one nevertheless of Baudelaire's "Woman is the opposite of the dandy." Even those very young girls, Purmelende d'Ostrelende in Sire Halewyn and the living corpse Mademoiselle Jafre, cannot entirely escape the grotesquerie of woman's condition. They are Woman, young or old as circumstances require, exemplars of their sex. Men, though treated in less summary fashion, are etched in acidly. One recalls Hieronymus in Magie rouge, Videbolle, Sire Goulave in La Balade du grand macabre, and a whole series, in Hop Signor, Escurial, L'Ecole des bouflons and elsewhere, of men blind or de- crepit or otherwise infirm. In conjuring up all this ugliness and, at times, poking fun at it, Ghelderode is carrying out one of the mis- sions of the theatre as he conceives it. His aim is to deflate a number of lying myths, and one of these is the delight man takes in his own beauty. So Ghelderode stresses man's physiological servitude and harps on his wretchedness. Like Sartre and like Celine, he dwells on the intestinal aspects of these miseries. His plays smell bad. Yet these odors-which, also, are man-engender comedy, however little it may appeal to the queasy. Are we not told that la Palatine, with the aid of her husband, a nincompoop in other domains of endeavor, used to organize crepitation contests-and this was France's great century! There is much talk of fecal matter in Ghelderode's plays. to underline the fact that man is not dust alone but also dung. He 92</page><page sequence="2">MICHELINE HERZ would prefer to see himself as a flower or a radiant body? So much the worse for him. Whereas, if he admits the restraints imposed by his bodily functions, he ceases to be civilizedly etiolated and enrols matter in his service. And matter, even fecal, is an inexhaustible source of comedy for the robust individuality imagined by Ghelderode. Like man's lot, the plot in which he is caught up is frequently a burlesque one. The deceived husband of Hop Signor dies during the hoodwinking process because he played the aristocrat, with a sword, and airs and graces that did not befit his station. The miserly Hieronymus (Magie rouge) harbors the horseman Armador, who has promised to manufacture gold. But Armador steals instead of providing, and with the help of the housewife Sybilla places responsi- bility for a murder on Hieronymus, who has already gone mad. This husband, who shuts up his wife with another man and marries off his doubloons so that they may multiply, is the central figure of a cruel farce in which avarice takes on hallucinatory dimensions. Even in the more sober plays, the burlesque aspects are always present. While a father gives way to grotesque grief for his dying daughter (Mademoiselle Jaire), the coffinmaker comes along to vaunt his merchandise: "For your soon-to-be-lamented daughter, I'll make a little masterpice of elegance, solidity and comfort." Or a bottle of Hollands gin consoles the three Mariekes, as they weep over the dead. Death, in Le Cavalier bizarre, spares the terrified old men who await his coming and bears off a new-born child. The title character of La Balade du grand macabre himself dies and his victims outlive him. The author, in Trois Acteurs, un drame, commits suicide, and not the, actor who had intended to do so. Examples could easily be multiplied. The burlesque atmosphere allows the spectator to put up with a degree of tension that might well evaporate, if the author tried to maintain it too long. A further merit of the burlesque, in Ghelde- rode's eyes, is that it gives direct expression to the voice of the people, which in Greek tragedy is embodied in the chorus. He roundly declares this to be so, and refers to the Mariekes mentioned above and to the buffoons in all the plays where they appear. Even in Barrabas and Marie la miserable, his religious plays, these procedures are used. In the same strain are the "plays within a play," the processions, the lines of mourners and the speeches, to which Ghelderode some- times turns too readily. It is less easy to speak of a burlesque character or of burlesque psychology, since Ghelderode rejects all psychology. The dramatist, he maintains, must draw upon the wellsprings of vision or of instinct. The writer who accepts a system will sooner or later trap himself in a problem play. Jean-Jacques, the author who serves as spokes-</page><page sequence="3">Yale French Studies man for Ghelderode himself in Sortie de l'acteur, proclaims that "I have never wanted to reveal or demonstrate anything and, as long as men have been mumming, the theatre has never been known to reveal anything whatever." The few characters who turn out well, in Michel de Ghelderode's plays, become human via their dehumanization. Like Jarry's per- sonages, they are so untrue that they achieve a truth of their own. Nekrozotar and Videbolle, the former a divine executioner mounted on the drunkard Porprenaz, and the latter the philosopher of the kingdom and a henpecked husband, are related to Tyl Eulenspiegel. They act, like worthy representatives of legendary chronicles, in a totally unforeseeable fashion. And we accept the spectacle of Vide- bolle overwhelmed with blows that would kill any mortal, just as we accept the unbelievable malevolence of Videbolle's wife Salivaine, the kingdom's grey eminence. Ghelderode's more anthropomorphic heroes, among them Charles V and Barrabas, are not exempt from the hyperbole favored by this author. In that magnificent play Le Soleil se couche Charles V gives orders for his funeral mass, little suspecting that he is falling into the trap laid for him by his son Philip. The examination of conscience he makes, to the accompani- ment of the objurgations of a talking parrot, shows him in turn as sincere and fraudulent, a believer and a skeptic, brave and cowardly, magnificent and pitiably deceived by Philip and the Holy Office. The hero of Barrabas is a wild beast one cannot readily imagine associated with any kind of Christian communism. To say what Ghelderode's characters are, unavoidably one must relate what they are doing or have done. They enjoy their liberty in the midst of the incredible and the extraordinary, and this liberty appears to be gratui- tous, for it is grafted much more firmly on a poetics than on any association of the characters with a world, a struggle or a passion, in which they would feel responsible for anything beyond themselves. With the sole exception of the cloistered Marie, the liberty of Ghelderode's characters revolves in a vacuum and may, in this sense, be classified as burlesque. Ghelderode, in his Entretiens d'Ostende, asserts that his plays are neither clerical nor anti-clerical. "Why," he goes on to say, "don't they make me out to be a Catholic author, while they're at it, since after all I've put saints on the stage!" However that may be, his education at the hands of the "clerical gentlemen" awakened within him a sense of metaphysical anguish. At first this was stilled by the teachings of the Church, but later, as he himself expressed it, his faith "drifted" and he found himself obliged to find an answer for the problems of our human condition. Whatever his religious feelings may have been at the time of his 94</page><page sequence="4">MICHELINE HERZ death, there can be no doubt that Ghelderode's guidelines are Christian. Ghelderodian man has a sense of sin. He knows that he is guilty. He is punished because he is guilty. He is capable of every "truculence," in the Latin sense of the word, and of every extrava- gance of behavior because, no matter what he does, he is certain to lose. His horizon is bounded by death. Thus the sense of the tragic, in Ghelderode's case, comes from the omnipresence of death. There is a lot of dying in his plays, he declares, because there is a lot of dying in life. Yet on several occasions he has let his characters pro- test against this bloody game. "There are three of us, and if only three of us die, it's because there's no one else." It is, indeed, more economical to list the plays in which death has no part. They are D'un diable qui precha merveilles, Le Club des menteurs, Les Vieillards, Adrian et Jusemina-a total of four plays out of the thirty printed in the five volumes of the Gallimard edition! Death is often a medieval figure, with an eroded snubnose, who sees fit to wander among the living. In Le Cavalier bizarre he is described as "very taken with himself, with protruding jaw, hand on hip, scythe over shoulder, wearing white boots and wrapped in a torn cloak strewn with small silver crosses." In Le Grand Macabre, he resembles the disguise a student might dream up for the Beaux Arts ball. In Escurial the king imagines him "as a skeleton sauntering about, in monk's clothing." Death, in Christophe Colomb, appears as a "naval officer, ageless." He is featured in the train of the Ship of Fools, along with young men wearing shrouds aand women similarly attired. In Masques Ostendais, Death is dressed in a dirty garment covered with crosses, with a battered top hat. In less incarnate fashion, death resolves the dilemmas confronting Doctor Faust and Sire Halewyn and Barrabas and Marie the wretched, for death alone confers peace. (The real drama for Ghelderode would be immortality, but not as Simone de Beauvoir has conceived it.) He tackles the related problem of resurrection in Mademoiselle Jaire and in the religious plays. He looks on resurrection, it would seem, as a privilege reserved for the gods. Thus the attitude of Ghelderode toward death is ambivalent. He desires it because of its purity and fears it because it might funnel one into a beyond where the angels would bear a distressing similarity to cops. He evolved, consequently, a kind of fetishism of death and bran- dished it, variously garbed, before the eyes of those eager to forget it. Western civilization, with its up-to-the-minute funeral rites and its painted and smiling corpses, has administered a tranquilizer to our feeling for death, and if ever Ghelderode set himself a mission, no doubt it was to remind men of how afraid they are-without over- looking the laugh that so often follows fear. 95</page><page sequence="5">Yale French Studies In his own way yet much as does Camus in Caligula, Ghelderode teaches his readers that men die and that they are not happy. But except in Sortie de l'acteur and Pantagleize, Ghelderode is on God's side-whether God exists or not. He sports death's colors no doubt because, having often been ill, he was able to become intimate with it, but also because he took great satisfaction in exorcizing it on his own account, while turning loose on other people his arsenal of Fates. Death, finally, is also the order in which one can believe. He sometimes comes close to imagining that it's all some monstrous legpull that a jovial Creator has inflicted on us, and that serves to get the creation going again. The function of the devil, never far away from the figure of death in Ghelderode's theatre, is to restore the category of Evil and reinsert it in a cosmos beneath the blazing sun of Satan. Love is the opium of the western world. Ghelderode goes further. Love, it is his conviction, is synonymous with lust, death's other companion on the portals of the churches. Thus eroticism is a source both of tragedy and of burlesquerie. It is tragic because it leads to nothingness, through the intermediary of sickness. Beauty, once possessed, is transmuted into a creature of the charnelhouse. But it is burlesque when baptized with the name of love and when the commentary is omitted that ". . . relates how the most azured and turtledovey amorous tale ends with the evocation of a bidet, of a bidet, Madame, were it made of gold and shaped like a heart." This is not to condemn the funtion that is sublimated under the name of love. The innocent Fernand d'Abcaude, in love with Azurine, is an object of ridicule until he does obeisance to the cult of Azurine, now unveiled and rebaptized Putregina. Normal pleasure, however, can- not be found in these plays, unless perhaps in the past, when the exploits of some duke are evoked. The flesh, alas, is sad and putres- cent. The couples-Marguerite Harstein and Jureal, Hieronymus and Sybilla-are sterile. Husbands appear to derive great pleasure from leaving their wives virgins, so that they can watch them suffer. Sexu- ality, or lust, imprisons man and more especially, perhaps, woman, who spices it with masochism when she is young and pretty and with ravenous unsatisfied instincts when she is older. In Hop Signor, which Ghelderode has characterized as the drama of impotence, Marguerite compares voluptuousness to a shortened form of torture and, finally, physical satisfaction coincides with the sleep of death. Love, with Ghelderode. has monstrous dimensions. Only in the brothel is it forgivable, and Putregina is assuredly the least morbid of all these creatures. Chastity is a virtue because love is a trap, leading to gestures by 96</page><page sequence="6">MICHELINE HERZ whose burlesque character Ghelderode is obsessed. In the kind of bacchanalian revel that permeates this theatre one may, perhaps, discern the ebullition of good health. Ghelderode has denied that he is "a pornographer-industrialist specializing in bourgeois orgasms." Perhaps he specializes in more literary orgies! The validity of Ghelderode's theater resides in its poetry. This does not appear to be so at first glance, and it was never his aim to write poetic plays. In each work there can be discovered, after careful investigation, a particular rhythm that concords with Ghelderode's vision. The words are linked in a musical sequence of cadences and leitmotifs that reinforce the overall theme. Most of his plays could readily be adapted for ballet. With him, gesture is primary and speech is subordinate to it, forming a sort of ground bass that accompanies the actors' plastic expression. When simplicity marks this poetry or these movements performed confronted by a veritable Chaplinade (to borrow the term created by ordinary folk as in Pantagleize or Le Club des menteurs, we are by Yvan Goll). The spectator, plunged in a world that precludes direct identification, has a poetic experience of or meets as in a dream protagonists endowed with a reality that to the spectator appears absurd. This moves him. He laughs. Ghelderode admired Chaplin. And an ironic satisfaction can be gleaned from the reflection that this figure of the poet as a gentle dreamer, innocent and pure, comic yet touching, links up beyond Chaplin with the scatterbrained charac- ters of Yiddish folklore. This poetry has a further strain of mystery, or of magic. The world contains things that are signs, and which may awaken at any instant. Life swarms with hollow receptacles waiting to be filled and, some- times kindly and sometimes maleficent, the forces that take them over plunge the individual if not in the religious sphere at least in the domain of the sacred. That is why puppets can represent the divine or, if one will, the essential element in human beings better than do actors of flesh and blood, whose gestures may lack the definitive or hieratic character that produces trance. And to that the spectator must be led, if the ceremony is to have its full effect. The puppeteer, furthermore, at least in the rudimentary form of the spectacle, utilizes nothing but his own voice, dehumanized by means of a kind of whistle. There is only one mediator between author and public. The treason of language is, in this way, practically eliminated. We inhabit pure poetry, where the puppet master is God. Clowns, puppets, buffoons and masks enrich this theatre with a poetry that is both fantastic and grotesque, realistic and allegorical, along with the "alienation" derived from a past left more or less 97</page><page sequence="7">Yale French Studies vague. This is a specifically dramatic poetry, since the stage is needed, but in its elements it is mythical. Through allegory it can strike a didactic note, and embrace the burlesque and satirical. On a higher level, the use of puppet or clown and the availability of multiple identities, in Ghelderode's best plays, reveal a universe that transcends the one we inhabit but which we feel nevertheless belongs to us. Thus Ghelderode's poetry, feeding on the supernatural, constitutes a kind of evocation, an incantatory art. La Sortie de l'acteur is con- cerned in part with the spell exercised by the author on his inter- preter. He summons up half-extinct towns, bygone days, male and female saints. The pathetic thing about these voyages of discovery initiated by a lonely man is that they affect him too nearly. He does not always avoid psychodrama. The disharmonies that at times spoil or wreck the poetic beauty attained by Ghelderode are remarkably similar to those that sometimes irritate us in the films of Ingmar Bergman. Michel de Ghelderode, despite his deliberately archaic and re- cherche vocabulary, neglected speech in favor of the visual. His world view is plastic. As a young man he haunted the art galleries, and philosophized as he looked at the canvases of the great masters of his own country: Bosch, Breughel, Teniers, Jordaens, James Ensor. "This Flemish nation in which I have my origins seems double to me. Matching its superb vitality and materialism is a preoccupation with metaphysical disquietude." Among the friends of his maturity were the painters Jean Jacques Gailliard, Marcel Stobbaerts and others, who no doubt guided him in his scenic researches. He was, furthermore, passionately addicted to those spectacles in which speech as such plays little part, operas, ballets, and the puppets in the vaulted cellars of Brussels. Passion- ately he wandered through the churches, where he admired the statues of the Virgin, and in public gardens, where he admired what- ever statues were to be seen. (His book, Mes Statues, has been pub- lished by the Editions du Carrefour.) As to everything else that was tangible, he reacted to the spectacle of everyday life, to funeral pro- cessions, festivals, passersby. Born in 1898, Ghelderode was inevitably affected by all the dis- tastes manifested by the literary leaders of the closing nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, before he came under the influence of surrealism or expressionism, those movements of his own generation. He repudiated the rationalistic humanism of the eighteenth cen- tury and, in accord with the tendencies of his masters both of pain- terly thought and of thought unqualified, he turned back to the ideals of the Renaissance, that savage century so like our own, with the frightening perspectives it presented to men, its unknown horizons 98</page><page sequence="8">MICHELINE HERZ in space and thought, its intellectual and sensual frenzies, a century in which suffering rubbed shoulders with laughter or even engendered it.-Doubtless it was this last aspect that most keenly marked the sensibility of our author. So he set out to acquire his own manner. Despite the inspiration he found in Charles de Coster's Ulenspiegel and Georges Eekhoud's Siecle de Shakespeare, his ancestry will turn out to be more French than could at first have been anticipated. Perceptible are Rabelais, Lesage and even Leon Daudet, whose Le Voyage de Shakespeare was cited by Ghelderode and whose countless novels, more richly expres- sive than they are descriptive, have been undeservedly neglected. For all his verbal ebullience, strange personages and startling, often gro- tesquely cruel scenes, Daudet remains nevertheless a pamphleteer, and we should not overstress the kinship. Ghelderode's highly charged style is sufficiently motivated by the theatrical perspective and the passions he wished to convey. But here is a sample of the way he answered journalists whose indiscreet curi- osity had angered him. "You mean the hypocrites, bigots, cagots and matagots forbidden by Gargantua to cross the threshold of his Abbey of Theleme? It's altogether too kind of you, my dear colleague, to concern yourself with this clerical scum! As for me, I sh.. on them from the morning angelus to the evening angelus!" The Word, here, is both sovereign and derelict. It is despised as a conveyor of certitudes but furbished anew with all its powers of suggestion, aristocratically, -much as Louis-Ferdinand Celine did, in his own back-to-the-people vein. Pierre de Boisdeffre has actually maintained that Ghelderode wrote anti-plays! Well, yes, if the lan- guage of Celine's Journey to the End of the Night makes it an anti- novel. But it is no difficult matter to regard as essentially dramatic the whole weight of sensuality that is embodied and rendered visible in language. Such a utilization of language clearly engenders both poetic and burlesque elements requiring a sensitive direction that remains faithful to the author's intentions. Michel de Ghelderode devalues the word as a bearer of meaning but reinstates it by loading it with poetry. This distrust of the word is also a distrust of the intelligence. Yet, to the extent that the bur- lesque expresses a certain delight in life's superabundance and that the poetic or comic elements spring from some encounter with the exaggerated and the ridiculous, in the end Ghelderode addresses himself to man's intelligence, not his sensibility. With respect to sensibility and intelligence alike, this art has limits that the poetic afflatus cannot entirely make up for. Sometimes the mythical quality is lost, to be replaced by a symbolism of a rather shopworn kind. If modern drama is to provide a specific experience, 99</page><page sequence="9">Yale French Studies it must present some passion involving the whole of man. Otherwise it vociferates oracularly and falls short of the universal. Confronted by man or by the created world, the dramatist must be touched by wonder, by love or its opposite. Quite certainly, in dealing with man, he must convey "something valid." Ghelderode asserts that he loves men ". . . as they should be loved, from a certain distance, and I am just as indulgent and sympa- thetic toward their weaknesses as, professionally speaking, I am inter- ested in their absurdities." This statement seems to imply that Ghelderode himself is not always personally involved. He is fascinated by this world he has created but sometimes he remains "outside." This makes the demon of bad faith prick up his ears. Ghelderode's anti-Semitism may be explained, perhaps, as due to his preoccupation with magic. His characterizations of the children of Israel, for all that, could have found a fitting place in such publications as Le Pilori. In Fastes d'enfer Simon Laquedeem, the wandering Jew transformed into a suifragan bishop, invents a new version of ritual murder, and as the curtain descends on his scene of triumph "his visage expresses a demoniacal glee." In Pantagleize, Rachel Silberschatz sets out to avenge her persecuted people by persecuting others, and Pantagleize describes the projected revolution in terms already familiar to readers of L'Action Franfaise. Of all the Jewish figures evoked by Ghelderode only the Judas of Barrabas is treated with some measure of sympathy, and in much the same way as did Leon Bloy, who recognized the metaphysical necessity of the betrayal. The Negroes Bam-Boulas and Beni-Bouftout are blacks that have been carefully filtered through a white consciousness, and not a single cliche is missing. Might not Ghetderode's racism be one as- pect of the profound attraction he feels for evil? "Count Von Lauterbach"-that was the first literary pseudonym adopted by Adolphe Adhemar Martens. Vis-a-vis humanity his atti- tude was that of an aristocrat well equipped to practice the cult of the ego and with a marked predilection for magic. Far from clashing with this vaunted anarchism, a certain traditionalist outlook blended in very well with the rejection of the rational. While all-out warfare against sentimental imbecilities may be thoroughly justified, there is a bookish quality about Ghelderode's notion of eroticism as a "seminal soup." The multiplicity of states of consciousness, and the unlimited transmutability of love and of the atmospheres it can conjure up-all that is absent from his work. For him, love is but the specter of a specter. If love were as simple or as unabashedly sadistic as it appears 100</page><page sequence="10">MICHELINE HERZ in this witches' brew, its toxic properties would surely have been discovered some little while ago! On the other hand, Michel de Ghelderode's dramatic ceuvre is entirely modern in its insistence on the ambiguity of our human lot. The burlesque and the tragic remain in balance, and subsumed in a poetry whose unquestionable originality is due to a use of lan- gauge devoid of all self-conscious "poetry." Yet man is man only be- cause he is able to declare what he is. The modern theatre, and much of the avant-garde along with it, is perhaps all the weaker for its ne- glect of this basic truth. When, however, Michel de Ghelderode ventures an assertion, his thought has an undeniably reactionary ring, and leaves us dissatisfied.' Utilized in this study were the five volumes of Ghelderode's Th "tre, pub- lished by Gallimard, and his Entretien de I'acteur, published by L'Arche. 101</page></plain_text>
