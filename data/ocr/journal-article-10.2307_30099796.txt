<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DESTINY OF MAN BY JOSEPH E. CANAVAN, S.J. Professor of Theology, Milltown Park, Dublin N the text-books of Theology the final destiny of man and the problems theological, dogmatic and philosophical-attendant upon it are treated independently of each other and in different courses. Ethics, refraining from making any statement about man's supernatural destiny, exatnines the question with Reason alone as guide ; Theology relies almost ex clusively on Revelation and Dogma wherefore these twain, Faith and Reason, hardly ever meet. Then, a600g the theologians themselves, the subject is parcelled out a600g various treatises the Beatific Vision is allotted to the treatise De Deo tin ; the essence and properties of supernatural being to the treatise De Deo Creante et Elevante ; the resur rection of the body to the treatise on the Last Things ; and the explanation of the desire in the human heart for a place of its own where, being itself, it may enter unimpeded into the timeless and placeless har600y of all things, is assigned to the treatise on Charity. Considering the importance of the subject, this fragmentary method is unsatisfactory ; for thus we do not see the question steadily nor as a whole. Pure de Broglie has removed that reproach by treating in one volume the principal problems concerning man's final destiny, and he does this from the standpoint of theology and dogma'. In a subsequent book he will explain the problems systematically. I The author, having students and their needs especially in mind, has composed a text-book in Latin and thrown the stages of his inquiry into the form of theses. This method of treatment, though it has many advantages, has some drawbacks. The Scriptures, the Fathers and the Councils are ransacked for quotations which seem to support the thesis without close enquiry into the context or into the meaning which words and phrases carried for those who originally used them. The evidence offered often arouses the suspicion that it has been hand-picked and to some extent distorted, because we attribute to ancient authors con300ts, quite legitimate in themselves and lawfully current a600g us, which were unknown to the earlier writers. Then, too, in books of this kind dogma is usually divorced from history. Pire de Broglie is fully aware of these defects and has, within the limits set by his method, endeavoured to correct them, realising at the same time that a freer and ampler method is desirable ; for he pleads in his preface for a division of labour between the positive and historical study of dogma and the systematic scholastic explanation of it. Those parts of the work in which the author allows De Fine Ultimo Humana Vita. By Vitus de Broglie, S.J. Paris : Beauchesne. 1948. pp. 299.</page><page sequence="2">198 Studies [JuNE himself more liberty in presenting and investigating a question are especially valuable. The book opens with an exposition and criticism of pre-Christian theories about the final destiny of mankind-Plato's, Aristotle's, the Stoics', Plotinus's-indicating what is ac300table in them and what is defective. Modern non-Catholic philosophers next come up for examination and sentence-Kant, the Pessimists, the Positivists, Bergson. Admittedly, the examination is cursory and rather off-hand, suggesting that the author does not mean to make an exhaustive inquiry into these theories but only to use them as pointers to what a Catholic may demand from his own dogma and philosophy. If such and such shortcomings are evident in these systems, how will Catholic doctrine answer the questions In that sense the attempts of others become, in the lay-out of his book, a kind of praeparatio evangelica for the Catholic solution which Pjre de Broglie undertakes to explain and justify. The Old and New Testaments are opened for light and St. Paul's teaching is carefully investigated, especially in respect of the old problem of how the disinterested love of friendship may contain without con tradicting itself the interested desire for and pleasure in the possession of the object loved-how agape rightly understood does not exclude eros. In this section, too, the author opens his criticism of the Quietist which he develops later, pointing out how far Quietism is dogmatically tolerable, how far it is philosophically wrong and ascetically dangerous. To remain totally passive until God floods the soul with the delights of mystic contemplation leads to the neglect, on our part, of self-denial, of the painful pursuit of virtue, and to a disdain for those ascetic systems which the church has approved of and experience confirmed. Quietists exaggerate in assuming that men and women are normally called to mystic contemplation, even though they make no sustained effort to acquire detachment ; and their influence, always strongest a600g the pious, is dangerous because it misleads its votaries under the guise of a sublime spiritual system. Idealism is a fine thing provided that high ideals are not advanced in extenuation of low practice. Just as, according to St. Augustine, charity is at once a vital movement of the soul towards its own perfection and a free gift of God's, so we should not, again according to St. Augustine, set our comtemplation above the needs of the church. The world in which we live must not be ignored in our quest for union with God. Against the Jansenists Pxre de Broglie proves what is, indeed, decisive in the matter, that the delectatio victrix of which St. Augustine speaks is not for St. Augustine an antecedent determinant of choice, but the invariable concomitant of all free choice, whether virtuous or not, because St. Augustine, defining liberty of the will differently from the theologians writing before Trent and after it, regarded liberty as the autonomous</page><page sequence="3">19491 The Destiny of Man igg affirmation of purpose without inquiring into the mechanism of the affirmation. For St. Augustine, election is not an essential element of all free choices ; for theologians of a later date, election is a necessary condition of the exercise of freedom within a restricted field of choice. Much confusion would be avoided if we recognised the distinction between the essential and the accidental, between the intrinsic finality of an act and its mechanism. Thus, too, we shall appreciate the depth of St. Augus tine's view of free will, forestall many apparent antinomies regarding the exercise of freedom in the Beatific Vision, and avoid misreading the theologians who dealt with such questions prior to Baius and Jansenius. II Pcre de Broglie adheres to the customary definition of the supernatural as that which exceeds both the powers and exigences of created Nature. He disengages the analogical meanings latent in the term " nature " and concludes that the supernatural must be conceived by way of antithesis to Nature written with a capital N and signifying that complex of laws to which created being is subject in this finite universe. Using Molina's account of the successive " moments," as we conceive them, prior to and including the divine decree of creation, he has no difficulty in showing that neither the Catholic theologians nor Baius nor Jansenius ever maintained that man in a state of innocence has a right in justice, founded in human nature, to the Beatific Vision unless he forfeits it by sin. The question moves exclusively about the ontological exigences of human beings whether or not, being such as they are, they may reasonably expect that the Creator, in endowing them with intellect and rational will, should destine them to supernatural beatitude as their final end-to a happiness beyond their natural powers to attain, but not alien to their exigences. Obviously, such an ontological exigence does not accrue from merit ; it rests upon a principle of intrinsic finality which exacts that each thing should be enabled to achieve the end pro portioned to its nature or else falsify its definition, since " good " is as much an attribute of Being as " true". Thus we may, by reduction, declare an ontological exigence by affirming that it is impossible for things to be otherwise, just as it is impossible for a man to exist without a soul. Pere de Broglie handles this problem primarily as a theologian : he reserves the systematic treatment of it for a subsequent volume. The Scriptures, the Fathers, the theologians with few ex300tions, and the dogmatic definitions of the Church leave us, in his judgment, no option the elevation of mankind to the supernatural order, both in respect of the final end and of the means to attain it, is the effect of divine bounty, entirely free to order things after a different fashion, conceding gifts</page><page sequence="4">200 Studies [Pair over and above what the deepest ontological exigences in man could claim or positively expect. Once the present supernatural Providence has been established as a contingent historical fact and the cause of it has been agreed upon, it was almost inevitable that questions should be asked about the hypothesis of man being left in the state of " pure nature " i.e., in those conditions in which, without any supernatural aid, he could achieve an end pro portioned to his natural powers-happiness outside the Beatific Vision, Here Pkre de Broglie joins issue with P ere de Lubac who, in " Surnaturel," seems to maintain that the Fathers and the theologians before Cajetan taught that no other end but a supernatural one could have been assigned by God for man. Nevertheless, Pyre de Lubac holds, both the fact of elevation and grace are in God's free gift ; and the definitions of the Church do not force us to assert as a corollary that a state of pure nature is possible. Cajetan, so Ptre de Lubac's indictment runs, set theologians on wrong courses by departing from the doctrine of his predecessors and distorting the true con300t of " nature". That drift, in full force even to-day, should be resisted in the name of tradition, of sound theologi cal reasoning and of piety. Pgre de Broglie traverses all these statements and, as a result, we may enjoy a dispute between theologians of high repute conducted in the grand manner, a duel with rapiers skilfully used in exact accordance with the rules of combat. We suspect, judging from the precise etiquette he observes even when he is making his most telling hits, that Psre de Broglie shares the view prevalent a600g the Irish duellists of the nineteenth century that to engage in single combat was a mark not only of esteem for your opponent but of affection as well. In Pbre de Broglie's opinion his particular question could not have been asked with any precision much before the time of Cajetan. St. Augustine did not busy himself with the question because he invariably discussed " nature " in its contingent historical setting, as his character and predilections prompted him to do and as the needs of his quarrel with the Pelagians demanded. For him the question whether or not a state of pure nature was possible, especially in so far as it excluded the call to a supernatural destiny, simply did not arise ; so he never discussed it ex professo. The Scholastic theologians before St. Thomas and St.. Thomas himself were engaged in a fight where no quarter was asked or given with the Nominalists who, relying on a distinction between potestas Del absoluta and potestas Dei ordinata, maintained that any and every condition decreed by God was natural. In that state of the con troversy the question concerning the possibility of a state of pure nature would have been unintelligible. Furthermore, the anthropomorphic con300t of Omnipotence cham pioned by the Occamists and shared, to some extent, by the Master of the Sentences and by St. Thomas in his youth made it impossible to</page><page sequence="5">1949 The Destiny of Man 201 arrive at a clear, accurate definition of possibility and impossibility in the metaphysical order. For, if possibility depends entirely upon an Omnipotent will antecedent to and divorced from other divine attributes such as Wisdom, Justice, Sanctity, then everything which did not contain an intrinsic contradiction was possible, though God would not wish it to be for extrinsic reasons drawn from His other perfections. One could not discuss whether God could or could not call man to a supernatural destiny until one had decided what God could or could not do ex potentia absoluta and what ex potentia ordinata. Later, St. Thomas opened the way for an intelligent treatment of the subject by setting down two principles dearly : viz, the first, that " nature " implied an int insic finality in things which thereby had an exigence to possess the means requisite for achieving the end proportioned to their natures ; the second, which runs thus : " In nobis in quibus potentia et essentia aliud est a voluntate et intellectu, et iterum intellectus aliud a sapientia et voluntas aliud a justitia, potest esse aliquid in potentia quod non potest esse in voluntate justa vel in intellectu sapiente. Sed in Deo est idem potentia et essentia et justitia. Unde nihil potest esse in potentia divina quod non potest esse in voluntate justa ipsius et intellectu sapiente ejus." (I. Q. 25. a5 ad x.). Once these two principles are ac300ted and assumed universally (and it took time to bring that about), it was understood by all parties to a dispute that liotentia absoluta should be conceived as omnipotence capable of producing whatever was intelligible and in accord with divine justice and wisdom, prior to any particular divine decree ; potentia ordinata was omnipotence putting into effect a particular choice a600g possible choices all equally open. At this stage of development one might ask intelligently whether a natural exigence of human nature resulting from an intrinsic finality in itself and from the har600y of Nature furnished the ground for a reasonable expectation that mankind should be called to supernatural happiness as the term of virtuous effort From these clarified notions of Omnipotence, Nature and Possibility an answer one way or another could be given to the question whether or not it were possible that men should not be called to a supernatural destiny-whether, in other words, a different economy from the present one was possible. If this alternative economy is called " a state of pure nature," these words may be introduced into the question provided " nature," " possibility " and " omnipotence " are understood in the same sense by all participants in the discussion as accurate and inter-related con300ts in an organised system of thought. St. Thomas did not himself work out all that was implicit in his notions. He had other things to do ; and this particular problem was not on the tapir since the Occarnists with whom he was engaged in mortal conflict were the last to deny, being voluntarists, that God could have set before</page><page sequence="6">202 Studies [JuNE mankind any destiny He pleased. And here Pire de Broglie, in accounting for St. Thomas's reticence, has a sly hit at certain " modern young men " who indulge without restraint the itch to renew all theology-what St. Thomas never did and particularly refrained from doing in the closing years of his life. III When Thomism had fought off its critics and established itself as respectable (that took a couple of centuries), Cajetan, Sylvester of Ferrara, Vitoria and others began to develop its " virtualities " in a confident spirit. Cajetan, admittedly, was the first to open the debate about " pure nature " and, like most pioneers, made mistakes, which others who came after him corrected. Then, when Baius published his books the problem became an urgent and burning question. He with most theologians of the period assented to the principles which elucidated the relation between Omnipotence, Nature and Possibility. So much being assumed, he argued thus Nothing can be conceived as the object of Omnipotence (or as simply possible that is not in accord with divine Wisdom and Justice. But the non-vocation of man, as yet innocent of sin, to the Vision of God would gainsay the Wisdom and Justice of God. (The Syllogism is Pire de Broglie's). Some few theologians-Aegidius Romanus in the Middle Ages and the Augustinian School, Noris, Berti, Belelli, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries-denied the major and conceded the minor ; but the other schools of theology all conceded the major and denied the minor-usually on the ground that the doctrine of grace as an absolutely free gift would be placed in deadly jeopardy if grace were owed in any sense to human nature upon any title or exigence whatsoever. Pore de Broglie defends the Thomistic standpoint ; Pim de Lubac favours the Aegidian approach as the most reasonable one, in closer accord with the teaching of the Schoolmen prior to Cajetan. And he maintains, moreover, that his view can be reconciled with dogma. Plire de Lubac claims that he has the support of St. Thomas for his opinion-offering, in the main, two reasons : the first, that St. Thomas never speaks of two ends open to man, one natural and the other super natural, superadded to the former, though he does say that grace is a gift superadded to nature ; the second, that the natural appetite for the Beatific Vision which St. Thomas admits must be an absolute, perfect desire in no sense conditional, which postulates that its fulfilment is positively, not merely negatively, possible. Pire de Broglie denies that St. Thomas could have so interpreted the natural appetite if he had any regard for consistency with essential elements in his own system. He does not argue to this conclusion from particular texts but from the</page><page sequence="7">2949 The Destiny of Man 2o3 general teaching of St. Thomas about Original Sin, the gratuity of grace, the fate of infants dying without baptism, the distinctions to be drawn in respect of " debitum," the nature of the two kinds of charity, natural and supernatural. Pdre de Broglie's argument against Ptre de Lubac's views draws on the analogies within the Thomistic system. The theologians who developed the Thomistic system evolved it correctly because they detected the ambiguities latent in such terms as Nature, Last End, and the natural desire for supernatural felicity. Many of these ambiguities have been noticed before, but Pere de Broglie has drawn attention to one of capital importance which had so far remained in the dark. We must distinguish, he warns us, between the problem of pure nature and the question about the possibility of man not being called to the vision of God. The decision about the possibility of a state of pure nature falls within the province of philosophy and systematic theology ; the answer to the other question is to be found in dogma. Consequently St. Thomas, recognising that historically only one end, a supernatural one, had been determined upon for mankind, admitting that he found in the human heart a rational desire for this end, would not have spoken accurately if he had said that this end was superadded to the natural end. One does not superadd something to what never existed. And Cajetan, Vitoria, Suarez, Bellarmine, Vasquez and the rest who, taking account of St. Thomas's system as a whole, applied its essential principles to new questions clamouring for an answer, did not misinterpret St. Thomas or draw down the science of theology into decadence when they held that the natural desire for beatitude could be nothing more than conditional ; for they knew how to distinguish between desire and hopeful expectation. They developed logically what was implicit in the Thomistic synthesis and defended Catholic tradition in maintaining that man's vocation to a supernatural destiny was the result of divine predilection and election, entirely free, and that, in consequence, man's non-vocation was possible. Iv Their method of enquiry and the conclusions they reached by applying it contributed greatly to dogmatic progress by enabling the church to formulate her dogmas in clear systematic definitions when occasion demanded. Whereas for Pare de Lubac Cajetan is the villain of the piece, the forts et origo mall, the evil genius of scientific theology who set the train that well nigh destroyed it as a science, for Pure de Broglie he is a daring and enlightened pioneer who opened the way into wide and rich country. If, on the other hand, the Aegidian school had prevailed, the science of theology would have degenerated into fantastic futility. These two eminent authors are, as is apparent, in sharp disagreement. Similarly, Nre de Lubac and Pere de Broglie are at variance about</page><page sequence="8">204 Studies [BINE the meaning to be read into the dogmatic censure by Pope Pius V on certain propositions of Baius and Jansenius. Pim de Lubac holds that while it is dogmatically indefensible to assert a juridic exigence in human nature to the Beatific Vision, it is still open to argue for an ontological exigence. Pgre de Broglie, on the other hand, admitting that the con demnation of Baius by Pius V did not touch the philosophic question about the possibility or impossibility of a state of pure nature, since everything here depends on the meaning given to terms, it did bear upon the denial that the non-vocation of mankind to beatitude was possible, or that a state of pure nature was possible if that statement were under stood within the system in which both Baius and Jansenius moved and wrote. And he cites in support of this judgment the " Explicatio Doc trinae " drawn up in 1586 by the Faculty of Louvain acting under the orders of Gregory XIII, and the " Opusculum " of Bellarmine. Both these authoritative documents state that the Papal condemnation re pudiates the doctrine that there is in human nature an ontological exigence for beatitude. It does not condemn what no theologian, least of all Baius and Jansenius, ever held, that man had a juridic claim on the supernatural. So, in Pnre de Broglie's judgment, all's well with the Science of Theology-it is alive and sensitive to the claims of correct and subtle reasoning. And in the course of time it has made notable progress in clarifying theological con300ts. It owes much to Cajetan and his suc cessors who, so far from impeding, promoted by their labours the progress of dogma, especially in the definitions which bear upon God's supernatural providence. The reader of Plre de Broglie's book will be fascinated by the clarity and precision with which he discovers the multiple analogies latent in terms much employed by theologians and the skill with which he uses them in argument. Here we see the scholastic method at its best, dis criminating and objective, handled by a master of the art-for, to argue convincingly from analogy is the mark of a keen and cultivated mind. There are no loose ends, no ragged margins : the theme and the logic are clear-cut and peremptory. This, together with the vast learning that supports the findings, places the work in the highest order of merit. Pim de Broglie sums up, in five propositions (and, perhaps, the number is significant), the views he defends in opposition to those defended by Pere de Lubac in Surnaturel. 1. It does not appear to be true that the theologians prior to the six teenth century admitted, even implicitly, that mankind was called necessarily to supernatural beatitude. 2. Nor is it true that the theologians of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, whether Catholics or heretics, ever confounded the ontological and the juridical exigences of created natures.</page><page sequence="9">1949 The Destiny of Man 2q5 3. The statement that ecclesiastical documents in asserting that the gifts conferred on Adam were " indebita " meant to exclude from human nature only a juridic claim on these gifts, cannot be reasonably sustained, so far as we can see, especially because no theologian ever put forward and defended that proposition. 4. The documents must be understood in the sense in which Catholic theologians have always understood them-viz., as excluding the ontological necessity or exigence of such gifts. We must draw the conclusion that it is part of Catholic doctrine that these gifts could be withheld from mankind even in the state of innocence. 5. Though Catholic dogma clearly affirms that mankind was not raised to the supernatural state and called to a supernatural destiny by the pressure of any necessity, that affirmation, is not equix alent to the statement that an economy of pure nature is possible. Never theless, the latter proposition is legitimately deduced from the former provided that the mind, freed from the puerile fancies of Aegidians and Occamists about " nature," " omnipotence " and possibility," employs con300ts that are truly philosophical. Pire de Lubac may feel that he is called upon to answer this grave indictment. We shall be interested to see how he will set about it ; and we fancy that if he wishes to make headway, he will have to approach his problem from a different point and handle it in another way. As it is, his book falls between two stools. It is not just a calm, objective history of theological speculation a600g the Schoolmen about the supernatural, nor just a warm defence of certain theses commending themselves to the author by their truth and spiritual flavour, but a mixture of both. As a result, the bias in favour of the theses disturbs his historical judgment. Thus much Pere de Lubac would be well advised to concede. V Neither is it possible for Pcre de Lubac to sustain either his doctrinal point of view, if he continues to discuss it within the framework of the Scholastic system-that is, if he uses exclusively its con300ts and method. Many generations of men with acute and disciplined minds have between them elaborated that system, so that it is now as close-knit and com pelling as any system of thought could well be. It is a winnowing fan of delicate precision, dividing the chaff from the grain and rejecting all that is not grist to its mill. Nothing alien to it can breathe its air and live. That is why in the present controversy all the honours seem to rest with Pire de Broglie who moves, a master of the craft, in and out through the system with fascinating dexterity. He has a sharp, detective intelligence, a kind of hand-cuff eye, as the best Scholastic theologians all have, for misdemeanours under the laws of their kingdom ; and the 4 4</page><page sequence="10">206 Studies [JuNE system does not bear gladly with eccentrics either. One cannot join battle with the system on its own ground, use similar weapons and equipment, and win. As a body of ordered thought in its chosen field it is practically invulnerable. Perhaps its success as a Science is one reason why some people feel something in it that repels them-those, namely, who doubt if the deepest mysteries of God's providence can be so neatly and tightly con300tualised. They suspect that a metaphysical system built by men, though true up to a point, subtle, too, consistent and refined in texture, is nevertheless not deep. It is too clear to mirror exactly the dark mysterious depths of being, particularly of rational being, and of providence. Comprehension is not a charism which God has conferred on man. There is beauty in symmetry, poise, obedience to recognisable law-a Greek temple, elegant and har600ious, is perfect of its kind, as were also the trim gardens with their measured streams which the Greeks loved ; but there is order and beauty also in the wild as well as in the sown-in the restless sea which the Greeks feared and in the mountains which they loathed. So, too, with man, especially with man in dependence upon and in communion with God. The whole mystery of that intercourse cannot be unravelled in a series of abstract propositions as if it were a problem in Euclid. These propositions state what must be true, if we be guided by Revelation and Reason ; but there are stretches of dark into which their light does not pierce. The human mind gropes for knowledge of infinite truth ; the will yearns for union with a beauty and goodness that will satisfy all its longings. Men know they have the capacity for such fulfilment, else God could not grant it to them without belying their nature ; and they know, too, that the capacity still remains if at best they know substantial truth only by deduction and analogy, and enjoy substantial beauty only vicariously in its finite reflexions. Does that native capacity for more than the theolo gians concede to it in a possible economy of pure nature, exert an influence on God That question still troubles the minds of some people even after they have heard the scholastic theologians triumphantly proving their theses. Nevertheless, even if theology cannot answer all our questions, it can tell us the answers we must not give to them. And our attempts to solve them must lie within the bounds of dogma. However deep we probe into this particular mystery of divine benevolence, we must acknow ledge without reserve that God freely raised mankind to a supernatural destiny and that an alternative of pure nature is possible. We must abide by what the Catholic theologians have agreed upon as Catholic doctrine. VI The issue seems to turn on the terms " exigence " and " freedom</page><page sequence="11">1949 The Destiny of Man 2o7 of choice". If one adheres to the Scholastic definitions one will find himself, like Laocoon, in the toils and be implicated, if he reaches a conclusion different from theirs, in heresy or its familiars. The Scholastic terms have had a history and they enter into controversy with all their history on their heads. They are the armour of the Catholic faith hammered out in battle with the heretics ; and dogma has canonised them in its definitions against heresy. They have served the cause of revealed truth well, so well that its defence would have been difficult, if not impossible, without their aid. It would be wrong to take liberties with them, for they will stand on their dignity and prevail. Perhaps, therefore, it would be better not to employ them at all if one has recourse to a method of enquiry, not opposed to, but beside the Scholastic method. The freedom of the will which the Scholastics define and defend against heretical views about the effect of Original Sin or of Grace upon it, is the freedom of the human will ; and even here they are concerned chiefly with the mechanism of choice. In a Being self-sufficient, om niscient and infinitely holy every act or action inaugurating and conserving a relation between other imperfect beings and itself as their fount, must be free. But, we ask, once such beings have been brought into existence, does the antecedent freedom of the Creator find itself under the pressure of a consequent necessity to provide them with such accidental perfections and aids without which their natures would be belied and the universe become a fantastic medley instead of an intelligible work of art. At this point one may introduce the con300t of exigence ; in fact one can hardly avoid doing so, if one studies the pressure of this consequent necessity from the side of created Nature. If, however, one admits that in the case under review, both that another economy is possible and that man has a real desire for happiness without alloy, for the informing of a conscious capacity in the very nature of intellect and will, need we introduce into our guesses at the solution the term " exigence," since exigence has been denied in respect of man and can have no meaning at all in respect of God. If God has in fact provided man with the opportunity of complete fulfilment, the sufficient reason must be in God Himself, a reason so consonant with His infinite perfection that any other relation with it on the part of rational creatures would be so improbable as to be almost unthinkable. Perhaps " exigence," if we consider Being as such and prescind from particular manifestations of it, is an analogate under an analogue. An aptitude for perfect fulfilment in such a creature as man is, is not necessarily an exigence either in the strict or the broad sense, but it may offer reasonable ground of hope. In satisfying the ardent desire God's gift of the supernatural would be entirely free in the Augustan sense of the term, but not surprising when we consider what man is and what God must be. Such a desire is not absolute ; but, if conditional,</page><page sequence="12">208 Studies it is conditional with a difference. Though man can lay no claims against the benevolence of God, he may cherish a hope which he feels practically certain will not be frustrated, that benevolence of that particular kind will be shown to him ; especially as God has revealed His extreme solicitude for His creatures' good in the fullest sense. Arguing then, via regressiva, from the actual choice on God's part of a supernatural destiny for man, we may perhaps conclude that God would not leave man in a state of pure nature ; for thus good would not diffuse itself in a manner congenial to the divine attributes. This is, in the last resort, the argument ex decentia which, we realise, must be very carefully handled as it is open to many abuses. VII How explain these paradoxes : hope that is not exactly expectation nor yet entirely conditional ; a certainty not based on a claim but on the infinite generosity of another ; an ardent desire that will feel no grievance if it be denied Pere de Lubac may find the way to resolve these para doxes, but we fear that he will have to forgo using Scholastic con300ts, because an ordered system of con300ts such as Scholasticism is, is not patient of paradox. Perhaps the Scriptures will give help. Does not Our Lord speak of a mandate which leaves Him free That must be a mandate of charity both from the context and from the nature of the case. Perhaps, too, the Mystics may throw light on the problem. Though some of the Scholas tic theologians enjoyed mystical experiences, the School does not as a rule make use of evidence drawn from religious experience. To-day men are groping for a mystique more than for strictly con300tualised systems. Is it not laudable that Catholic theologians should endeavour to explain a saving mystique within the confines of dogma Here, too, as elsewhere Pkre de Lubac will move over dangerous and encumbered ground, strewn with the heresies of Modernists and of many a600g those who call themselves Existentialists. Strait is the gate through which he must enter and the path to it is, like the bridge of Al-Sirat, narrow as a single hair. We shall eagerly await his reply to Ppre de Broglie's book. If he succeeds in allaying the fears and suspicions of vigilant theologians he may, like Cajetan, contribute something towards the progress of dogma. J. E. CANAVAN</page></plain_text>
