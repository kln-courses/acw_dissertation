INTRODUCTION Professor A. G. Morton, in the Preface to his excellent History of Botanical Science, makes a telling point: 'Before everything, botany is the creation of botanists: knowledge of their lives and tribulations, their characters and motives, are part of the fabric of its history.' In the following, the tribulations and motives are described from a heated debate of some 72 years ago on the teaching of elementary Botany. As such it is surely part of the fabric of the development of the subject as taught today. Those on both sides of the debate held to their views with great determination. Nor was it entirely an instance of the 'Old Guard' versus the 'Young Turks'. Those on the two sides covered a range of ages and breadths of experience. The question remains why there was such entrenched opposition to the broadening of the curricula to include larger components of physiology, genetics and ecology. In the following account, the underlying causes of this opposition are discussed. 2. DRAMA TIS PERSONAE 1901: a memorable year for Frederick Orpen Bower, then 46 years old, and in his sixteenth year as Regius Professor of Botany at Glasgow University. Elected to the Royal Society 10 years before, he was in 1901 entering on his first term on its Council. Some thirty major papers published over 20 years, mainly on the anatomy and morphology of the ferns, had established his authoritative standing. On the afternoon of 13 June 1901, the first purpose-built botanical institute in Britain, and the first separate science building on the University of Glasgow campus at Gilmorehill, was officially opened by Sir Joseph Hooker at 3.00 p.m., as part of the ninth jubilee celebrations at the University. The distinguished company included Principal Story, Lord Lister (Professor of Surgery at the University 1860-9, and a self-confessed dedicated botanist), Lord Kelvin, Sir William Thiselton-Dyer, Director of Kew Gardens, who (with Sir Joseph Hooker) had pressurized Bower into accepting appointment to the Glasgow Chair in 1885. Other leading botanists present included W. G. Farlow from Harvard, E. A. Timiriazeff from Moscow and Isaac Bayley Balfour, Regius Professor at Edinburgh and Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden, all three of whom had been recipients that morning of Honorary Doctorates of Laws at a marathon ceremony of capping and hooding 126 honorary graduates. Also present were D. H. Scott from the Jodrell Laboratory at Kew, and J. W. H. Trail from Aberdeen and Patrick Geddes from Dundee, both Professors of Botany. The opening of the Botany building marked for Bower the end of 15 years of waiting - years of hope and disappointment, of planning and replanning, and of argument and * See also the Editorial Note which precedes this article. 1 -2</page><page sequence="2">4 A. D. Boney counter-argument in the Senate, mainly with the medical professors, during which time he made at least one serious threat of resignation. In the end, only the diplomatic intervention of Lord Kelvin had resolved matters and the opening ceremony was a triumph both for Bower's determination and the respect that the Senate had for its illustrious senior member. The timing of the opening ceremony was important for another reason. That summer, Glasgow was to be the venue for the 71st meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, (BAAS) and it had been Bower's long-standing ambition that his new building would be available for the sessions of Section K (Botany) (Fig. 1). A group photograph of the Section K participants was a natural outcome and it was inevitable that such a group photograph would contain those present of authoritative standing, those with fast-growing reputations and those on the threshold of their careers. It so happens that this group photograph of forty-two of the Section K participants includes a number of those who were to be principal combatants 16-17 years later in the 'Tansley Manifesto' affair. The key figure, A. G. Tansley [1]* (Cambridge), sits in the front row on the extreme left of the photograph beside J. W. H. Trail [2] (Professor at Aberdeen). Isaac Bayley Balfour [6] (President that year of Section K) sits in the centre of the front row with Francis Darwin [10] and A. C. Seward [11] (both from Cambridge) seated to his left. In the standing row immediately behind are A. W. Hill [18] (Cambridge); P. Groom [19] (later Assistant Professor at Imperial College, London); W. Gardiner [20] (Cambridge); J. Bretland Farmer [21] (Royal College of Science); J. Reynolds Green [22], the Cambridge plant physiologist and botanical historian; Miss Annie Lorrain-Smith [23], the lichenologist; F. T. E. Weiss [25] (later to be Professor at Manchester) and F. F. Blackman [26] (Cambridge). Other notable participants included A. and Miss G. Lister [29, 30], well known for their work on the Mycetozoa, and E. A. N. Arber [38] from Cambridge. The formidable women's hats of the time sheltered some lady assistants at Glasgow and the Misses Ethel Sargent [33] and M. Benson [35]. Standing at the extreme right of the back row in the photograph are two of Bower's colleagues at Glasgow, D. T. Gwynne-Vaughan [36] and W. H. Lang [37], the former with a somewhat quizzical expression, the latter more serious (he was described by one of his students of the time as 'looking like an apostle'). Both had been appointed assistants to Bower in 1896 and subsequently promoted to lectureships. With Bower, they constituted the 'triumvirate' of their mutual correspondence. Gwynne-Vaughan was to die from lung phthisis in 1915, just 12 months after his appointment to the Chair of Botany at Reading following his occupancy of the Chair at Queen's University, Belfast. Lang was to become first holder of the Barker Chair of Cryptogamic Botany at Manchester in 1909 and to become drawn into the 'l\/anifesto' controversy, albeit somewhat unwillingly. Bower [7], having arranged the party for the photograph, had left no room for himself and so had to sit on the ground at the feet of Balfour holding a vasculum. The Balfour-Bower combination was to play a significant role in the 'Tansley Manifesto' affair. Bower's sudden and unexpected removal to the Glasgow chair in 1885 from a Lectureship at the Normal School of Science at South Kensington' was followed 3 years later by Balfour's move from Oxford to Edinburgh on the death of Alexander Dickson in December 1887. Bower had followed Balfour at Glasgow and had in fact been a close contender with him for the Sherardian Chair of Botany at Oxford in 1884, as is clear from the letter of support he received from Thiselton-Dyer when making formal application for the Glasgow Chair, namely 'It is an open secret that had not Professor Bayley Balfour's senior scientific standing properly weighed with the electors, you would have been appointed to the Professorship at Oxford. '2 The close accord of the two was thus of long standing, as Bower explained in a letter to C. W. Wardlaw in 1933 :3 ' The isolation in Glasgow in 1885 was terrible to me after Cambridge, only Dickson in Edinboro' and Trail in Aberdeen and neither of them was modern. So I made a rule of visiting all the main centres at least once and spent all the time I could at Kew. Gradually the isolation resolved itself - chiefly by the return of Balfour to Edinburgh in 1888-9. ' Their views on the teaching of Botany were identical and there were close similarities between the elementary courses at Glasgow and Edinburgh. This close accord in things botanical was also cemented byv a close friendship, as evinced by Balfour's reply of 1 April 1920 to Bower's letter of congratulation following the award of his knighthood: ' our friendship has been * The figures wvithin square brackets identify participants at 71st BAAS.

Boney an asset of my life deeply prized, and all you say to me now comes home with the force of it.'4 Together they ruled Botany in Scotland and were fully prepared to exert a powerful influence on affairs south of the border when occasion demanded. This last is evident both in the 'Manifesto' affair and its aftermath. 3. THE 'MANIFESTO' The so-called 'Manifesto' was an article published in The New Phytologist in December 1917, under the title 'The Reconstruction of Elementary Botany Teaching', with five signatories, F. F. Blackman, V. H. Blackman, F. Keeble, F. W. Oliver and A. G. Tansley.5 The inclusion of Tansley's name convinced most of the botanists in Britain that he was the main driving force behind the article and, in much of the private and public correspondence which ensued, this assumption is implicit. In fact, Tansley was never the principal actor in the 'Affair', The late Sir Harry Godwin in a letter to me on the 'Manifesto' controversy, dated 2 June 1984, wrote: 'A. G. Tansley ... told me later that the young revolutionists such as F. F. and V. H. Blackman and others, came to rely on him to draft their manifestos. This, of course, he did excellently well and it was no doubt thought that he was the driving force in the movement: this was not so ... it was a shared movement whose success later was spontaneous.' Nevertheless, the inclusion of his name and the fact that he used his right as proprietor and editor of The New Phytologist to give the article publicity was regarded as being evidence enough. Tansley became the focal point of the ensuing controversy. The 'Memorandum' - the title by which the authors identified their proposals - occupies twelve pages. The term 'manifesto' emerged soon afterwards in correspondence between A. C. Seward and Bower. In a letter dated 30 January 1918, Seward remarked: 'have just read The New Phytologist manifesto and sent a frivolous reply',6 and later (6 April 1918) 'I hope you will print your views about this monstrous manifesto. '7 No punches were pulled in the memorandum. From its opening sentence: 'A disquieting feeling that all is not well with the position of academic botany in this country has been growing for several years in the minds of many botanists,' there follows a series of statements which, in the light of the prevailing attitudes of the time, were mostly provocative and sometimes pejorative. The burden of the memorandum was a simple one. Elementary Botany courses in the universities were too heavily weighted in favour of morphology, especially with regard to phylogenetic implications, and that biochemistry, physiology, genetics and plant ecology received scant attention. As stated in a key paragraph: Botany in this country is still largely dominated by the morphological tradition, founded on an attempt to trace the phylogenetic relationships of plants, which began as the result of the general acceptance of the doctrine of descent. Elementary teaching (as well as a very large part of advanced teaching) is mainly occupied with the endless facts of structure and their interpretation from the phylogenetic standpoint. Side by side with this there generally goes a discussion which is often limited by a crude Darwinian teleology. Plant physiology is relegated in most cases to a subordinate place and is taught as a separate subject. The newer studies of ecology and genetics play a very small part in the curriculum Other phrases were guaranteed to evoke spirited responses - and were probably included for that very reason. Thus the current morphological approach was: 'not of a nature of originality to attract the best types of mind amongst possible students' (my italics). Whilst accepting that morphological botany in the hands of an enthusiastic teacher could be a valuable instrument of education: ' [it] ought not to be the main topic of elementary education ... in its current form it is sterile and leads to little but further refinements of itself... [it] does not attract the type of mind that wants a deeper insight into the working of plant processes or the part plants play in the economy of the world.' The memorialists were careful not totally to decry the work of the plant morphologist schools in Britain. Indeed, they paid full tribute to its pre-eminent international standing: 'it has worthily upheld the loftiest traditions of pure science'. However, they then pointed out that this very success had led to morphology overshadowing academic Botany in Britain, 'and to direct effort away from the channels which we cannot but regard as most essential to the healthy life of botany as a whole '. In their concluding sentences, there comes: ' Comparative anatomy should be reduced</page><page sequence="5">The 'Tansley Manifesto' affair 7 to a subordinate position and should be used primarily to illustrate the principle of division of labour and the progressive ecological adaptation of the great phyla.' That some plant physiology was taught in elementary courses was acknowledged - but 'the basic value of these (vital) studies is not clearly shown to the elementary student because his teaching is mainly in the hands of men who are primarily morphologists'. As a consequence, the teaching of physiology tended to become 'a somewhat dreary catalogue of the results in inconclusive experiments, and in the laboratory, a series of exercises in test-tube reactions and in the use of standard pieces of apparatus'. Nor were certain plant physiologists of the day free from criticism, namely 'Teachers ... who have an intimate acquaintance with structure or who can use plants as vehicles of chemical and physical experiments but have no practical knowledge of the life of plants in field or garden ... men who were in fact remote from reality in all that concerns plants as living agents.' Botany must avoid becoming 'a concatenation of specialized subjects which have lost organic connection'. Finally, the credo of the memorialists came in the following. There should be a treatment of the physiological as well as the structural life history of the individual plant, passing on to different ecological types with the physiological as well as their structural characters and leading to an elementary treatment of competition and the social life of plants. The field of ecology should thus be developed on a physiological basis. At the end, Tansley, as Editor, offered the pages of future numbers of The New Phytologist as the forum for the 'free expressions of opinion from all botanists, and, above all, practical suggestions as to reform'. These were not long in coming. The memorandum also contained some suggestions on the structure of honours courses but, since the main arguments surrounded the elementary curricula, these will be principally referred to in the following. 4. PRIVATE REACTIONS AND PUBLIC RESPONSES The five memorialists completed their paper in November 1917 and it was published on 20 December. They would have awaited the New Year with more than usual interest. The first reactions were of course expressed in private correspondence. It was inevitable that Bower, regarded as the 'ultra-morphologist', should become the centrepoint of the developing discussion. The first comment to him, that of Seward, has already been noted. The 'frivolous reply' - the first published response - was under the heading 'The Examination of a Witness' - representing a cross-examination of the 'Witness' (Seward) by 'The Five Wise Men' (TFWM) - 'the authors of the recently published edict'.8 On 6 April 1918 Seward, in a short note to Bower, pressed him to print his views on the 'monstrous manifesto'. With regard to his own 'frivolous reply', Seward explained that he 'could not resist the temptation after reading his dogmatic and dictatorial utterance '.' (Note 'his' i.e., Tansley's 'dogmatic and dictatorial utterance' - not 'their' !). Tansley had accepted Seward's 'frivolous reply' but questioned whether such an approach would not interfere with serious criticism. Meanwhile, Bower had written a letter ('not for publication') to Tansley on 31 January 1918,9 in which he stated that he was in full agreement with much of the manifesto, 'but, like all would-be reformers, I think you have overstated your case'. Bower then pointed out that, with the large numbers of students in the elementary courses at Glasgow and Edinburgh (and Manchester), there were obvious limitations in the practice of laboratory work. He also stressed the basic importance of a training in plant morphology - 'you cannot work a machine without knowing something of its construction ' - but agreed that the vital side of the study of plants was as important. He pointed out that, at Glasgow, he taught the living plant not the dead (he was at that time well into the last stages of preparing his text book, Botany of the Living Plant, to be published in 1919, so may well have been a little oversensitive). Bower also claimed to have given one of the first plant physiology courses in Britain in 1884 when he was a Lecturer at the Normal School of Science at South Kensington, under T. H. Huxley. (The course was given in the summer of 1884 and consisted of ten lectures together with 'illustrative demonstration experiments '.) Hence Bower stated 'So that I who am perhaps regarded as ultra-morphologist am not quite a " black sheep ". ' Bower expressed particular exception to the statement that plant morphology should occupy a subordinate position in elementary curricula. He would agree to its being in a co-ordinate position, so that all branches of</page><page sequence="6">8 A. D. Boney the subject could receive equal treatment. But to advise that plant morphology should be subordinate placed the reformers in a 'perilous and indefensible position'. He also pointed to his key roles in the 1894 and 1895 BAAS meetings in the controversies surrounding the proposed removal of plant physiology from Section K and joining it with animal physiology in a separate Physiology section - a proposal which met with the universal opposition of the botanists, headed by Bower. Tansley's letter of 2 February 191810 in reply was at pains to remove the impression apparent in Bower's letter that there was any personal attack in the Memorandum. 'The essence of our case is that the centre of interest in elementary teaching is wrong. That is the point made - I think it difficult to escape.' Tansley pressed Bower for something for publication. He also acknowledged Bower's early contributions to the teaching of physiology. He commended Bower's hard work helping to prevent the splitting of Botany at the 1894 and 1895 meetings of the BAAS and his interests in the 'vital side' of Botany. Writing of his own experience of plant morphology in a further letter to Bower on 13 February,1" Tansley stated that he 'could not attack a subject which occupied ten years of my life and gave intellectual pleasure of the keenest sort. We were not attacking it in itself, but the undue place it has had, and still has, in elementary teaching.' By the same token, he described the teaching of plant physiology as being ultra-academic, 'largely as a result of the partial segregation which exists in the teaching of the different "branches" of the subject'. What was wanted was a unifying theme linked with subjects such as agriculture, horticulture and forestry. Despite the calls from all sides that he make public his views, Bower's response to the 'Manifesto' was absolutely in character. He first indicated his differing viewpoints in private correspondence to Tansley and only made his views public when invited to do so. His proposed reply to the memorandum had, in fact, been carefully mapped out directly after reading it but, in its final written form, it was sent to W. H. Lang and Balfour for criticism and revision before sending on to Tansley. Meanwhile, the replies invited by Tansley had not been slow in coming. Reference has already been made to Seward's response. His pretended cross-examination revolved around the Cambridge elementary course of the time, which was neo-Darwinian and morphological in its approach, and included some fossil botany. In defence, the 'Witness' stated that he regarded the integration of plant morphology and physiology to be quite normal in elementary teaching, and drastically to reduce the former would be detrimental. Nor should the teacher ever be overconcerned whether his course would be of value to the later work of the student. Too much concern on this aspect would mean that the teacher 'is not likely to produce botanists who can adapt themselves to the particular conditions under which they may eventually be placed'. To the question posed by " The Five Wise Men' on the value of ecology in elementary teaching, Seward's reply was a graphic example of some contemporary opinions. Whilst admitting that he had never lectured on the topic 'I have, however, gleaned one fact from a perusal of ecological literature: as Huxley said of Scholastic philosophy, " it is surrounded by a dense thicket of thorny logomachies, and obscured by a dust-cloud of barbarous and perplexing terminology" ... it is not in my opinion a subject which can profitably be included, except in the most general way, in an elementary course.' T. G. Hill's published letter came from one who had been away from Botany on war work for 3 years and, in general, he agreed with the proposals in the memorandum.12 In addition, he called for increased staffing in Botany departments, to include a chemist and a physicist. Students in practical physiology classes should construct their own apparatus whenever possible. The system of examinations needed drastic revision. He finally proposed the formation of a permanent committee of responsible botanists who would ' consider the whole question and decide on a course of action'. The result would then be communicated to all relevant teachers who would then devise the best action suitable for local conditions. Both the contents of the memorandum and T. G. Hill's proposals on a central committee received short shrift from R. C. McLean13. McLean supported the emphasis on plant morphology in elementary classes, on the premise that the tangible was more easily learned than the abstract but then marred his argument by the statement that plant morphology was more acceptable to the student when taught even by indifferent teachers than was plant physiology even when the latter was taught by teachers of personality. Above all he</page><page sequence="7">The 'Tansley Manifesto' affair 9 made an impassioned plea for freedom of action and interpretation without centralized control as suggested by T. G. Hill. The well-known duo of later years, F. E. Fritsch, then Head of the Department of Botany and later (1924) Professor, at East London College, and E. J. Salisbury, then Lecturer in the same College, next entered the discussion.14 Whilst agreeing with the view that morphology was too dominant, they were quick to point out that the great morphological tradition built up over the years came largely as a result of the 'Botanical Renaissance' in Britain of the 1870s, for which W. T. Thiselton-Dyer was regarded as the prime instigator. This 're-awakening' was a positive shift away from the overall dominance of courses by systematic Botany through the early and mid-years of the previous century. They then pointed out that, as a result, taxonomy had become confined to a hole and corner existence in curricula. They were thus concerned that any further modifications might reduce morphology to being a similar 'barren remnant'. They also questioned the inclusion of ecology in elementary courses since 'many of the results ... are as yet necessarily tentative', and asked that 'the physiological conception should be infused into morphology and anatomy'. The inclusion of practical field experiments was regarded as most valuable - each department should have a garden for experimental work by students. The letter which followed from S. Mangham first of all questioned the generalization that the overemphasis on morphology was true of all elementary curricula.15 He then proposed that a centralized assessment should be made of all botany departments - staffing, curricula, student numbers and compositions, finance, research, accommodation, etc. The ensuing report would then be evaluated by those concerned with curriculum planning or used to influence public opinion and government departments. These suggestions had something in common with T. G. Hill's central committee approach - but neither author indicated the likely composition of such a committee nor who would organize the massive enquiry. (Today we may reflect on how, over recent years, the gathering of such encyclopaedic data on departments has become almost an annual ritual!) The next contribution to the published discussion came from Bower, with a letter entitled 'Botanical Bolshevism '.16 One can sense in all the attendant correspondence the underlying question: 'What will Bower have to say?' As already indicated, Bower was never one to make controversial moves precipitately. He had earlier 'sounded' W. H. Lang's views on the 'manifesto' (all his life Bower held in high regard Lang's interpretations of any discursive point). Lang, in a letter dated 20 January 1918, confessed that he had not read the manifesto, only glanced at it.17 He was 'not much moved by manifestos of reform ... every Professor is always reforming - as far as conditions will allow', and, 'Manifestos will not alter the soulless teachers even if they get a changed syllabus - and an intelligent teacher can take care of himself.' Lang was also critical of those signatories who lacked any experience of large practical classes: "Practical limitations are there, as we know, when numbers get above twenty.' H. H. Dixon, writing to Bower from Dublin on 24 February 1918, held similar views to Lang, stated more trenchantly '[it was] a deplorable medieval attitude to assert that any branch of knowledge or research is a blind alley'.18 D. H. Scott, in a letter of 2 April 1918, in response to an enquiry by Bower, stated that he was in general agreement with the views Bower had expressed, and, regarding the 'encyclical' described it as 'an example of fashion in science - a thing I have a strong objection to'.19 Bower's letter for publication in The New Phytologist had been roughly formulated in the days immediately following the publication of the memorandum.20 These draft notes state: Most definitive objective of physiology is Form. Signatories seem to desire to put this out of sight. To the organographist every observation of form presents a physiological problem. He may not be able to solve it. But at least he does not wish to shelve it. The attitude of antithesis is itself what is wrong, and this the signatories ought to reconsider. There are those whose would eliminate the facts of alternation from elementary exposition. They wotild pass over the great part played by the rise of the sporophyte and suppression of the gametophyte in producing land vegetation as we see it. They would promote in its place a study of Ecology as exemplified by more modern types by their more direct adjustment to their surrounding. Whilst not denying the importance of this aspect of Botanical study, it seems inconsistent with the elimination of the Hofmeisterian story which rightly presented is the greatest example of practical adjustment to the surroundings. It is as if an anatomist were to eliminate the vertebral column and central nervous system from elementary teaching and confine his pupils to an extensive study of digits and dermal</page><page sequence="8">10 A. D. Boney appendages: or an architect who would enjoy intensive study of pinnacles and crockets but omit any examination of foundations, pillars and arches from his instructions. The establishment of the sporophyte on land is the great text of Ecology. That branch will never receive the recognition it deserves from Botanists at large till this is realized by the ecologists themselves. The first draft of Bower's letter to The New Phytologist has not survived. It was sent to Lang and Balfour for their comments. Lang's reply of 20 April 1918 was brief and to the point.21 The contents of the manuscript he considered entirely relevant and appreciated the: 'forensic style - therein lie dangers but you are quite as well able to guard against these ... I have a distaste for the whole idea of reconstruction by "letters to the newspaper" approach ... futile to waste research time on it ... but you made the sharpening of arrows a holiday job.' Also 'the expression is rightly personal and as such is not adapted for criticism'. Some advice included: 'Put in the practical difficulty of large elementary classes - in text or as footnote ... Do not give up morphological position so much.' Lang objected to too much harping on Organography and Organographist ('a new term and I do not like it'). He concluded, 'why not say that in teaching the living plant you get morphology and physiology fused so that they "remain one flesh"'. In Lang's overall correspondence one can detect a slight air of disinterest - as if too much fuss was being made over an affair of no great importance. Not so with Bayley Balfour. Balfour's handwriting at best is not the most legible. Writing in reply to Bower's draft he seems to have been in the white heat of excitement, to the extent that parts of his letter are unreadable but for the pencilled interpretations made by Bower of some difficult words. Balfour's letter may usefully be quoted in full, both with regard to the 'manifesto affair' and its aftermath.22 17 April 1918 My dear Bower, You may well ask who makes them lords over us? Their pigeonholed brains seem unable to understand that the work of nature can only be understood if the construction is known and conversely. All this talk of subordination! The failure of the physiology of which they talk is a consequence of its complication of method (experimental). You remember the young man of Punch whose knowledge of root pressure derived from an elaborate lecture experiment - suggested the substitution of this for fire hydrants. Keeble's book is good. All others are either dull or uninspiring - the plant is merely a bit of technical application to show or demonstrate a physical or chemical point. Where is the life? It is first because physiologists do not present the 'living plant' and morphologists do present it that the latter make their subject live. I am not at all sure that it is wise to accept the challenge on the grounds put forward by the Bolsheviks. We are not morphologists with the limited outlook suggested. They have been physiologists with their limited vision. I teach organography and so do you. That interprets form and function as interdependent. It gives the living plant. And then tell me how do modern physiological shibboliths help to appreciation of the living plant? Chemical problems are safe to explain(?) by Enzyme?! Take geotropism with its positive, negative, and so forth. Using big names which do not explain. And then if you read F. F. Blackman on carbon relations in nature - you are up against one of the most serious factors in plant physiology - its indefiniteness both in fact and explanation. I think your excellent counterblast would be stronger if in refusing to admit the Bolshevik's position you pointed out their anti-chauvinism in supporting that either physiology or morphology are living subjects in themselves - that it is impossible to discuss a matter of this kind on such false premises. That you have always and all active teachers of the day deal with organography (see about in my letter in reply your useful hint of Goebel at the beginning of his 'Organography' paper). I would not I think use the word competition on p. 5. That they may seize upon. There is no competition - can be none for the subjects are inseparable. It is a bit of d-d presumption on the part of the coterie to make claim that they only teach the living plant - and they deserve to be told so as you do. You are right in speaking of the Committee as superfluous. Remind them of the doctors of Tooley St. Every teacher must be on the alert to improve his teaching - but such improvement can only come from the individual. And as you well say it is personality that tells in teaching. Yours I. Bayley Balfour In the absence of the original draft of Bower's ' counterblast ' we cannot be sure whether the title was entirely his, or that 'bolshevism' was added after considering Balfour's letter. The contents of Bower's published letter follow similar lines to those in his private letter to Tansley of 31 J anuary, and his draft notes quoted above. To the statement in the memorandum that</page><page sequence="9">The 'Tansley Manifesto' affair 11 morphologists gave the wrong bias in their teaching, he countered by stating that they teach organography, which interprets form and function as interdependent 'so fused that the twain are one flesh. In fact, they endeavour, as I have always done, to present to the elementary class the Living Plant.' The signatories were also reminded of the attempts to separate plant physiology at the 1894 and 1895 meetings of the BAAS - and that it was a morphologist - Bower himself - who proposed the motion that the study of plants should remain one subject. He took the five to task for stating that the emphasis on morphology sprang from the revival of the study of fossil plants, pointing out that the origins lay in the work of Hofmeister, Sachs and de Bary - and that the awakened interest in fossil plants was as much due to the lead given by the morphologists. The core of Bower's complaint, however, remained with the statement in the memorandum that comparative anatomy should be subordinate to other branches of the subject, not co-ordinate as Bower regarded it. This proposal to impose such drastic changes in curricular balance was the implicit 'bolshevism' which Bower regarded as dangerous: 'The spirit which has ruined Russia and endangered the future of civilization. Are the signatories prepared to follow a like course?' The final dig came with the comment 'Physician heal thyself' - i.e., maybe the fault lay in the inability of the ecologists and physiologists fully to co-ordinate their own teaching programmes. Tansley's letter of acknowledgement23 (25 April 1918) thanked Bower for his contribution to the discussion, it being 'very well put and contains some just criticism'. In a covering letter to Tansley sent with 'Botanical Bolshevism' Bower had written: 'you probably won't like what I say'. To this Tansley replied: 'I am afraid, however, you are still harbouring a delusion as to our, or at least my, attitude ... I like whatever contributes to the elucidation of the truth as your letter does. Don't you think you might give me credit for that?' A. W. Hill, writing to Bower from Kew on 27 June 1918, and acknowledging Bower's published response, was somewhat more scathing about the 'not very inspiring signatories', and made some personal comments on individuals, which, even with the passage of time, are best not referred to named individuals.24 Two of them were described as 'the most dreary of elementary teachers', and one other was 'a gas-bag of the first water'. Hill further pointed out that no schedule modification would turn lame dogs into useful botanists and that pandering to the weak was no way of forwarding the progress of science. He recalled how H. Marshall Ward in later years at Cambridge tried to cater for 90-95 %0 of the third class men - but that only 5-10 % of the first class were worth considering. Hill also raised the question of the logistics of laboratory classes in practical physiology;' Have these 5 wise men never been boys in a chemical lab? Physiology and ecology for elementary students - with very large classes - would mean a similar condition of general pandemonium.' Miss M. C. Stopes (later to reach wider fame as Dr Marie Stopes), the palaeobotanist, wrote to Bower on 22 July 1918, fully supporting his stance,25 and her own published letter under the heading 'An Argument for Morphology', called for the retention of the status quo, with physiology subservient to anatomy and morphology: 'Whatever the after work on plants, an accurate mental picture of the essentials of their organs and tissues forms the firm foundation of all conceptions about them.'26 With what seems a courageous letter, Miss M. C. Rayner, then a Lecturer at University College, Reading, and later to be distinguished as a mycologist, took Bower to task for the implications of his 'Botanical Bolshevism', pointing out that since political bolshevism could be regarded as a reaction against intolerable conditions, could not a similar situation have arisen with the teaching of elementary Botany, and calling for drastic measures.27 The writer supported the main tenets of the memorandum, whilst acknowledging the difficulties in effectively teaching practical plant physiology to very large classes. A lengthy contribution came from D. Thoday, then Lecturer in Plant Physiology at M\anchester, and immediately to become Professor in Capetown, returning to hold the Chair at Bangor in 1923.28 He acknowledged the difficulties of teaching plant physiology compared with the 'self- contained' nature of morphology. The letter included a clinical appraisal of the teaching of plant physiology, detailing some worthwhile new approaches. Thus the proper study of the development and maturation of the Pellia sporogonium could effectively combine morphological and physiological principles - perhaps a subtle ' dig' at the entirely phylogenetic approach to sporophyte biology then dominant. A similarly lengthy letter came from W. Stiles, then Lecturer in Plant Physiology at Leeds, and to be made Professor at Reading within 12 months.29 He took up the question of inadequate remuneration of botanists - a point also aired in the memo-</page><page sequence="10">12 A. D. Boney randum - and proposed that collective action was necessary, advising botanists to join the recently formed National Union of Scientific Workers. (One can imagine the effect such a suggestion must have had on the botanical 'Establishment' of the day, with their evident fears of the spread of Bolshevism!) His principal argument was with the interpretation of teaching the Botany of the living plant, as so many of the correspondents claimed that they were doing. He was as critical of those who put over-emphasis on biochemistry as with those who concentrated too much on morphology in relation to phylogeny. His final sentence is not without interest. Referring to the suggestions of the signatories of the original memorandum, he states 'We who are younger and uninfluential look to them to show us the way.' J. Small (the 'indefatigable Small' according to senior botanists of the time), then a postgraduate student at Bedford College, London, and later to be Professor at Queen's University, Belfast, contributed a lengthy and quite ingenious letter under the heading 'The student as a synthesizing organism .30 The organism required four factors for effective functioning, plants, books, lecture notes and synthesizing energy. This last came from the teacher and this energy input into the system would only have its full illuminating effect if the teacher reached red heat in enthusiasm, and the effect would increase as the temperature of the energy source rose higher. Morphologists as the sources of this synthesizing energy had the advantage of a factual basis, so that their enthusiasm was less likely to be dampened by uncertainties, as would seem to be the lot of the physiologists. Hence he proposed that elementary teaching should concentrate on organography and ecology. Bower continued to receive letters of approbation through 1918. The most important of these came from C. Briquet, of the Conserve Jardin Botanique in Geneva. Writing on 10 August, Briquet sent his 'felicitations' on Bower's article - 'a judgement of the revolutionary theses of the five proceeds from most thorough good sense - as to be expected from a botanist of your experience ... structure and function go hand in hand ... good teachers will find their way to render this truth intelligible to pupils'.31 But what follows in Briquet's letter seems to have caused Bower more concern than any other item of correspondence, namely, 'Scientific periodicals in Britain are lucky to have paper enough to waste on such a discussion, gives your continental friends a comforting idea of the high economical state of your country. Paper is now very dear and singularly precious stuff in Switzerland. We could not afford as much as The New Phytologist.' Bower sent Briquet's letter to Tansley with a covering note (24 July),32 in which he expressed the hope that you as editor bear fully in mind your responsibility, viz., that whilst The New Phytologist serves as a 'cockpit' for us, it also reveals us very fully to the foreign eye. In the present case there is some risk of laying us open to even more sarcastic remarks than those of Briquet. I hope it is not so - but the responsibility lies with you - to consider whether any benefit it may produce at home will balance any harm it may do abroad. I mean this quite seriously and without any wish to 'score'. Tansley's reply came within 2 days.33 He considered Briquet's letter 'interesting as a psychological judgement. The feeling the whole thing rouses convinces me more strongly that ventilation was badly required' Below Tansley's signature Bower pencilled the gist of his reply: 'My reply to him was that if he were to walk stark naked down King's Parade it would cause much "feeling", but that would not prove that it would be a desirable thing to do!' Tansley's reply (29 July 1918)34 included: Naturally I don't contend that any action which arouses 'feeling' is thereby proved desirable. That would be a lunatic contention. What I think in this case is that the feeling aroused suggests that the existing state of things cann.ot be defended successfully on its merits. Your comparison with walking down King's Parade, however, suggests another feeling -namely, the objection to 'washing dirty linen in public '. Up to a point I agree, and that is why the thing was put in The Newv Phytologist, which, so far as I know, is read by none but botanists. The thing is in that sense a domestic question, though it is part of a wider one. Any less publicity would not have served the purpose, which at present is to elicit opinion and to find out how far a successful defence of what seems to be 'prima facie ' undefensible can be put up. But as to the linen you are in this dilemma. If it is dirty it wants washing and that is the main thing. If it is clean, as I think you hold, you have no cause to dread public ablutions even if they are unnecessary. You may, I gather you do, think the whole thing unnecessary and ridiculous, but if others do not why should you be angry ?</page><page sequence="11">The 'Tansley Manifesto' affair 13 What appears to have been the final letter in the exchange was written by Bower on 1 August.35 I don't like your figure of linen and in my view the dilemma of dirty or clean does not arise. If I am to continue your metaphor in order to explain myself (though I thought my printed letter explained pretty clearly that I do not assume the present state of things to be ideal or precluded from improvement) I would point out that what I object to is the displaying of the wash, dirty or clean, before the drawing room windows when you have asked a party to tea. However irreproachable the wash might be, that would not be a desirable thing to do. I fear that the Briquet sarcasm will not be the only expression of amazement we may receive from abroad at our gratuitous display of underclothing - dirty or clean. But really we need not continue these pretty figures of speech. If you are, as I gather satisfied that this mode of eliciting opinion - by newspaper correspondence - is in the interest of British Botany, and the best or only way of eliciting it, all I can say is that some whose opinions you might value (not only myself) do not agree with you. 5. THE SIGNATORIES SUM UP In print, the overall discussion occupied some twelve months, with the last major contribution being that of W. Stiles, dated 16 November 1918. Thereafter, in December 1918 and January 1919, four of the signatories gave summaries of their views on the discussion. V. H. Blackman and F. W. Oliver both considered that the memorandum publication had been justified and, in general, felt that support lay with the signatories. V. H. Blackman36 took issue with correspondents who had used terms such as 'oppression', 'dragooning', 'bolshevism' - and questioned whether anyone could imagine Professor Bower being coerced or oppressed. The overall proposal in the memorandum was to teach the living plant - the plant as a living, struggling organism. He reiterated that morphology - as interpreted solely in terms of phylogeny - should be subordinate to other sections of Botany. F. W. Oliver's37 views on 'balance' in elementary Botany courses were implicit in his statement: 'That there is no department of botany the open door of which should not be opened sufficiently wide for an impression to be gained of the treasure within.' The most lengthy contribution came from F. F. Blackman,38 giving almost an evolutionary overview of the development of botanical science through some nine phases, namely starting with economic plant exploitation, then the herbals, followed in order by taxonomy, comparative anatomy and morphology, plant physiology, genetics, ecology, the biology of the individual, and the last phase. This last phase being reached when all biological phenomena had been considered in full, both in its historical and functional aspects. Blackman considered Botany to be a federation of sections -and that an elementary student should become familiar with each acquisition -'the living plant yields place to nothing in its scientific interest'. Tansley rounded off the overall discussion and seemed satisfied that it had served its purpose.39 He was at pains to emphasize that it was morphology with a phylogenetic bias which lay at the core of the dissension. A close study of plant structure without a phylogenetic bias was regarded as an essential element in the training of any botanist. He also referred to several objectors to the term 'crude Darwinian teleology' used in the memorandum and pointed out that the signatories objected to misuse of the theory of natural selection by bad teachers - especially their anthropomorphic and slipshod methods of presentation. An idea aired in the correspondence - that of a committee of experienced botanists who would meet and discuss the 'ideal' elementary syllabus - had in fact been put into practice. A meeting of botanists sympathetic to the views of the memorandum had taken place in January 1919 and a small committee was formed to compile such a syllabus. (This latter seems to have passed into a botanical limbo.) Despite the acrimonious nature of some of the correspondence, the signatories of the memorandum could indeed be fairly satisfied with the outcome. The balance of support had come from individuals newly appointed to chairs, or who were soon to be professors, many of whom in the next 20-30 years would make significant impacts on those branches of botanical science, physiology and ecology, then under discussion. Indeed, the balance of opinions has all the appearance of the ' Old Guard ' versus the ' Young Turks ', though in fact the ages were somewhat mixed. Balfour was 65 years of age in 1918, Bower 63 and D. H. Scott 64, Seward 55, A. W. Hill 43, Lang 44 and H. H. Dixon 49. Of the signatories, Oliver was 54, F. F. Blackman 52, Keeble 48, Tansley 47 and V. H. Blackman 46. The more prominent supporters of the memorandum (Fritsch, T. G. Hill, Thoday, Salisbury and Stiles) were in their 20s and 30s. Yet the degree of acrimony</page><page sequence="12">A. D. Boney shown by some opponents was deep-seated, long-lasting and seemingly aimed at Tansley alone. Sir Harry Godwin in his Tansley Lecture to the British Ecological Society has described this period in Tansley's life (1914-27) under the heading 'Disillusion and Disaffection'.40 This state of affairs is some reflection of the aftermath of the 'manifesto affair' and warrants some further investigation. 6. 'STOKER TO THE FOOTPLATE DRIVER' One noticeable feature of the controversy was that Balfour played no direct role in the proceedings, yet it is evident that he was fiercely partisan about the affair and, as 'stoker' to Bower's 'foot-plate driving' (the late Sir Harry Godwin's terminology!), played a not insignificant indirect function. The antipathy to Tansley's botanical views seem to be of long-standing. In Tansley's years of 'disillusion and disenchantment' the 'major alleviation' was to come in 1915 with his election to Fellowship of the Royal Society.40 The certificate proposing Tansley's election was circulated late in 1910. Bower, in a letter to Balfour on 6 December 1910, stated that he was drawing up a certificate for D. T. Gwynne-Vaughan (that for the other member of the triumvirate, Lang, had already been presented, and he was to be elected to Fellowship in 1911). According to Bower, Gwynne-Vaughan, on the basis of his published work, 'ought to stand before Tansley '.41 Gwynne- Vaughan, writing to Bower on 7 December 1910, in response to a request for a list of publications, questioned whether it was the right time for his name to be proposed, since there was a whole crowd of botanists due for election before he could get a chance - for example 'Tansley - without hesitation '.42 He continued 'Some matter of policy underlies the decided prematuracy - so I fall in with your wishes ... I take it that it refers to future possibilities - altho' I don't altogether like it. It has a distinct suggestion of a scramble.' As described by Godwin,40 Tansley's early research in Botany was on plant anatomy and palaeobotany and, in 1901, he accompanied W. H. Lang to Ceylon and the Malay Peninsula, collecting material for anatomical studies on ferns, and at the same time making notes and attempting to interpret the vegetation observed. On his return, he read two classic ecological texts of the time, Warming's Plantesamfund (Oekologische Pflanzengeographie in the German translation), and Schimper's Pflanzengeographie auf physiologischen Grundlage. At the time he was working as Assistant to F. W. Oliver at University College, London, and assisted Oliver in studies on the vegetation of coastal communities. His specialized interests thus became firmly established in plant ecology. He launched The New Phytologist in 1902 as a medium for botanical discussion and, as noted by Godwin,40 'he effectively employed it to foster the infant growth of British ecology'. The concise nature and unifying theme of Warming's book was considered by Tansley to be the starting point for the modern study of plant ecology in Britain and the USA.43 Tansley's concept of modern plant ecology was essentially the synecological approach - the study of plant communities, the description and analysis of which, with a suitable terminology, would lead on to the experimental study of causes and mechanisms. In this approach, he was at one with F. E. Clements, the pioneer of synecological studies in the USA. Tansley's assumption of the mantle of responsibility for plant ecology in Britain, and his support with Clements for the synecological approach, may have been a factor underlying Balfour's role as the 'stoker'. In 1909 the Clarendon Press published Oecology of Plants by E. Warming and M. Vahl. This was based on Plantesamfund but was practically a new work. It was prepared for publication in English by P. Groom, then Assistant Professor at Imperial College, and by Balfour, who provided an introductory note. The subtitle of the book is An Introduction to the Study of Plant Communities. As a systematist and plant geographer, Balfour accepted the definition of plant communities by Warming. He seems to have taken great exception to the mode of development of plant ecology in Britain under Tansley, as shown in a letter to Bower dated 11 April 191844 The best practical ecologist is the gardener ... If all so-called ecologists were gardeners first there would be more reality and less trifling in a subject which seems at present subject to the reproach in Twinkle twink ecologist Do try and dispel the mist Which by use of words uncouth You create and hide the truth.</page><page sequence="13">The 'Tansley Manifesto' affair 15 In a later letter (6 July 1918), with reference to Bower's 'New Phytologist Retort'. Balfour again registered his strictures in rhyme : I thought I saw a twist of pipes And heard a moaning chant. I looked again and found it was The Cambridge Living Plant: Intaking CO2 in streams Without an aspirant. I thought I saw a cuttlefish In showers of inky mist. Again I looked at who it was - Cam's great ecologist! Bemusedly reforming Morph - and Physiologist! One of the factors underlying Balfour's acrimony - as indicated in his first rhyming sequence - may well have been the synecological approach advocated by Tansley, with an 'appropriate and effective terminology' (Godwin40). Seward, in his Examination of a Witness, had referred to the 'barbarous and perplexing terminology' of the ecologists. Bower's views on ecology were summed up in a letter written to G. A. Macmillan, of the publishing firm, in July 1917, when the format of his proposed text-book Botany of the Living Plant was under discussion. Macmillan had questioned the absence of any in-depth reference to ecology in the proposed book, especially since ecology was now included in the syllabus for Senior Local Examinations. Bower in reply pointed out that the omission was not accidental since: ' Ec = phys. + water + camera It can be found if wanted, but the word will not change the thing.'46 Of course the ecological dimension was but part of the underlying antagonism in some of the exchanges. Despite Tansley's assurances to the contrary, Bower and Balfour felt that their interpretations of the teaching of elementary Botany were under direct frontal attack. We must not underestimate the deep convictions of both that theirs was the only satisfactory way of teaching elementary Botany - convictions which they held almost emotionally sacrosanct. Thus Balfour, writing near his retirement on 29 October 1921, stated: ' of the many pangs attendant, none is more poignant than the severing of our co-partnership in the work of developing and maintaining Scottish Botany'.47 Through their 'confident mutual alliance' they could claim 'that Botany is in a much sounder state in Scotland than it was in the eighties when we commenced its reconstruction'. And still with reference to the ' Manifesto', Balfour continued: ' Re the egregious pronouncement of Tansley - " all is not well with the teaching of botany ". If only he had inserted "any " instead of "the " before "teaching " and "in England " after "Botany" - I would have cheered him to the echo!' Bower wrote in similar vein in his published reply to the memorandum when he referred to the ideal elementary course as a coordination of the several branches of the subject, without subordination, namely 'these and other branches of the subject should start equal and combined, as they do in the north'. Similarly, in commenting on the complimentary remarks by the signatories on the contributions of the British school of morphologists, Bower pointed out that many had entered botany as an ' obsession ' more than a ' profession ', and that their enthusiasm had ' caught the generous mind of the student '16 Here Bower refers to the impact of the ' Botanical Renaissance' in Britain in the 1870s. This re-awakening represented the victory of the advocates of ' experimental ' Botany over the prevailing descriptive systematic Botany of the time - an experimental approach based on the teachings and methods of Hofmeister, Sachs and de Bary. W. T. Thiselton-Dyer is credited with the initiation of the ' New Botany ' teaching in Britain in the 1 870s through his lectures and laboratory courses (the latter being the most significant component) at the Normal School of Science at South Kensington (forerunner of the Royal College of Science and Imperial College) under T. H. Huxley. S. H. Vines, who had worked as an Assistant at South Kensington, was responsible for introducing the 'New Botany' to a wider audience through his Lectureship at Cambridge. Bower was one of the first beneficiaries of this ' New Botany ' as a final</page><page sequence="14">16 A. D. Boney year undergraduate at Cambridge in 1877, having also received a 'taste' of the new approach to biology teaching under Michael Foster in 1875. After the disappointment and disillusion of the first two years of Cambridge Botany at that time ('moribund in the summer and actually dead in the winter'), the revitalizing effect of Vines's courses underlay the 'obsession rather than profession' viewpoint of later years. Bower had worked under Sachs at Wuirzburg in the summer of 1877 and then spent the 1878-79 winter semester at Strasbourg in de Bary's laboratory - so experiencing at first hand the teaching of two of the fountainheads of the 'New Botany'. Hence he felt himself- to have been a full participant in the botanical revival (though not actually an instigator). Balfour had also worked at Wiirzburg and at Strasbourg in 1873. There was a generation gap between them and the younger botanists, the latter having experienced the 'New Botany' without knowing what had gone before. It is even more difficult for us to appreciate the impact that the 'coming of the laboratory' had on the recipients. Harry Marshall Ward, Professor at Cambridge from 1895-1906, is remembered as a distinguished botanist and mycologist, and as the student who fainted with excitement at the laboratory bench during one of Thiselton-Dyer's laboratory classes in the Normal School at South Kensington. For Ward, the 'New Botany' was ever afterwards 'the Cause,' and support and propagation of 'the Cause' became the life's work of its principal advocates, many of whom came to occupy prestigious Chairs. They applied almost a missionary zeal to this propagation of 'the Cause,' and the application of its morphological basis to phylogenetic studies was linked with their principal research interests. Balfour, whilst not a recipient of the 'New Botany' as a student at Edinburgh (where he graduated in 1873), had worked as an Assistant at South Kensington in 1875 in addition to his studies under Sachs and de Bary. When he was appointed to the Glasgow Chair in 1879, he immediately arranged to exchange the Botany lecture room for two rooms, the larger to be used as a teaching laboratory (for the furnishing of which the Senate allowed /21 7s Od), the smaller one to be for himself and his Assistant. For his lectures, he borrowed the lecture room of another professor, usually one in the Arts Faculty, whose lectures were given in the winter session whilst the Botany lectures were restricted to the summer months. Whilst the University supplied the laboratory furnishings and laid on the water supply, the microscopes and any other apparatus were purchased by the Professor. Thus, in 1885 when he succeeded Balfour at Glasgow, one of Bower's first acts was to purchase the microscopes and other teaching apparatus from his predecessor. Balfour was committed to the proper role of the laboratory in Botany teaching from the start of his three professorships. From the outset in Scotland Balfour and Bower had to contend with large classes, rarely less than 150 students (principally medicals) and sometimes more than 300 - hence their strong feelings about suitable laboratory experimentation in plant physiology for such numbers. Bower had the logistics of these large classes well worked out. Thus C. W. Wardlaw, his Assistant during the 1920s, recalled in a letter to W. H. Lang in December 1948: 'It just did not occur to us that we could begin a day's work with the medical, or any other, class unless all arrangements were at the pitch of perfection, e.g. 5 stages of fern prothallus showing everything.'48 A further element of the concern felt by Bower lay in the interpretation of what constituted a course on 'the living plant'. On all sides of the 'manifesto' argument there was this claim that it was the 'living plant' which must lie at the core of any elementary course. As earlier stated, in 1918 Bower was in the final stages of preparation of the manuscript of Botany of the Living Plant for Macmillan &amp; Co. This book had originated in 1914 as a joint effort with W. H. Lang under the proposed title Botany for Medical Students. Delays owing to various types of war work held up its development, and in the end Lang withdrew. Bower in 1917 then suggested to the publishers that a book based on his Glasgow lectures ' licked into shape over the last 30 years ' - would be suitable for a wider student audience, and proposed the title The Living Plant. One of the referees pointed out that this title already existed for a book by Ganong. A number of titles were then considered (' Plants and Their Functions '; ' The Plant as a Living Organism '; ' The Growing Plant '; ' Living Plants Described '; ' Plant Life '; ' A Study of the Living Plant ') before the final title was decided. Botany of the Living Plant was intended as Bower's magnum opus on the teaching of Botany. The criticisms voiced in the memorandum seemed indeed to be directly aimed at the manuscript even then receiving its final touches on his desk. Balfour' s withdrawal from any active role in the controversy is explained by Bower in his obituary. Towards the end of his tenure of the Chair, Balfour rarely left Edinburgh or even moved</page><page sequence="15">The 'Tansley Manifesto' affair 17 much outside the boundary of the Royal Botanic Garden. The war years had taken their toll, not least 'a cruel personal loss at the front'."' Balfour in 1918 was a broken man with declining health. He had always admired the ebullient nature of his close friend at Glasgow and seemed well satisfied for Bower to lead the main offensive. Of the two, there was more personal 'animus' towards Tansley on Balfour's part. At no time is there evidence of this in Bower's correspondence. 7. AFTERMATH Of course the affair did not end with Tansley's summing up in January 1919. Some manifestations of the aftermath were to become apparent before the end of the same year. S. H. Vines wrote to Bower on 9 September 1919,50 intimating that he was resigning from the Sherardian Chair of Botany at Oxford at the end of the year and, in a later letter (18 September), stated that he was anxious about his successor - but did not himself know the young men well enough.51 This announcement and the publication of the notice of election triggered off a flurry of correspondence. Bower wrote to Vines by return with a fulsome support for W. H. Lang and wrote to Balfour in similar vein. Balfour, however, in reply, pointed out to Bower: 'You forgot about Farmer - it would not surprise me if he went - I should like to see him back again at research'.52 J. Bretland Farmer, then 53 years of age, was Professor and Director of the Biological Laboratories at Imperial College and had been Balfour's star pupil during the latter's time at Oxford. A further complication came with the death on 18 September 1919 of J. W. H. Trail at Aberdeen. Lang was regarded by many as a likely successor there. In the end, Farmer had no wish to leave London and he regarded Lang as the best candidate for Oxford. Lang, however, had decided against involving himself with the Aberdeen appointment and had also decided not to make application for the Oxford Chair, the Senate at Manchester having made definite moves to keep him in the Barker Chair. The evident surprise at Edinburgh and Glasgow at the outcome is reflected in Bower's letter to Balfour of 19 December 1919: 'But how strange that your best pupil and my best pupil, for very diverse reasons, both held aloof. Who would have thought that 15 years ago. We shall have to talk it over! Echoes of the 'Manifesto affair' were immediately apparent when it was realized that Tansley was a candidate for the Oxford Chair. Balfour, writing to Bower on 12 September 1919, was convinced that Tansley would not get the Oxford Chair but 'he may get Birmingham '.54 Again the personal 'animus' already pointed out comes to the surface, Balfour being convinced that once away from Cambridge and its prestige 'his measure will be apparent'. Balfour's letter was written before he realized that he was to be one of the Board of Electors for the Oxford appointment, together with A. C. Seward and D. H. Scott as the botanical representatives. Whilst Balfour had served on the Board some years before, he had assumed that his period of service had expired. Having been informed, somewhat belatedly, of his position as an Elector, he ruefully commented to Bower his hope that, 'my ignorance has not landed me in indiscretion this talking and commenting upon the possibilities! '55 The outcome was that F. W. Keeble, then Director of the Royal Horticultural Society Gardens at Wisley, was appointed to the Oxford Chair. A. C. Seward, writing to Bower on 20 December 1919, indicated that the choice had lain between Keeble and Tansley.56 Whilst Seward had considered Tansley the better man, his view was in a minority on the Board. Seward had since written to both candidates and had told Keeble 'frankly ... I considered Tansley's claims on the whole stronger'. After the announcement of Keeble's appointment, Bower commented to Balfour ' At the same time I cannot help feeling sympathy with Tansley in what will be for him a bitter disappointment. I hope it will not sour him or cause any unhappy split. '57 The evident sympathy shown by Bower seems not to have been shared by Balfour. In the letter to Bower of 29 October 1921 (already quoted), Balfour again referred to the Oxford appointment and the 'Manifesto '. ' I laughed in my sleeves when at the election of the Oxford Professorship Seward, solemnly and at great length, gave as one of Tansley's chief claims to the appointment " his signal services as a reformer on botanical teaching " . .. My word, Bowver, how I chuckle when I think what a bombshell your Botany of the Living Plant must have been to that coterie - witness their feeble attempts by seizing on a few technical points. ' In none of the correspondence, public and private, from Bower on the matter is it possible to detect any rancour. The only time an edge appears is when Bower writes about Briquet's letter - and here he may have ANP 118</page><page sequence="16">18 A. D. Boney been somewhat oversensitive to an overseas opinion. There is one curious side issue in the Oxford appointment, which comes to light in a letter from Seward to Bower dated 15 October 191958 - 'The Oxford Chair is interesting - I am on the Board of Electors - where you ought to be.' Similar viewpoints are discretely hinted at by other correspondents. We are left wondering at Bower's exclusion from the Board - as did also many others at the time and, perhaps, he himself. With Balfour, however, there would have been two Professors from Scotland - perhaps the puzzlement was over Balfour's prolonged inclusion. In 1923, Tansley was President of Section K at the Liverpool BAAS meeting. Godwin40 commented on the 'curious aura of loneliness' around Tansley at this meeting. Bower, however, wrote a complimentary letter regarding the Presidential address and, in Tansley's reply, the rumblings of the 'Manifesto' controversy can still be heard,59 namely, Of course morphologists are not as black as they are painted - nobody ever is! - nor as white either! Furthermore the old physiologists were just as bad, as I said in my address. And did I not add that 'there were honourable exceptions in both camps'. Of course I know you and others treated structure in relation to function - my point was that it was exclusively or almost exclusively in relation to the 'function' of the adult structure, rather than in relation to the processes which produce the structure. 8. RETROSPECT Looking back from the vista some 73 years on, we may well wonder at the furore raised over such straightforward and sensible proposals. We might well concur with the comments of a character in C. P. Snow's The Masters regarding an academic argument, namely 'that it generated more heat than light'. This even more so when we reflect that the proposals of the 'bolsheviks' have for so long been accepted as a sound basis for elementary Botany teaching. There is an underlying question of why the dedicated revolutionaries of the late 1 870s and early 1 880s, the ardent protagonists of the 'New Botany', became in later life so entrenched and inflexible in their views - an example of the enthusiastic radicals becoming in time the confirmed conservatives? Perhaps the key word lies in a statement, already quoted, that the 'New Botany' became more of an 'Obsession than a Profession'. Was this a wise choice of terminology? The Oxford English Dictionary defines obsession, in the sense used above, as 'the action of a "fixed idea" which persistently assails or vexes, especially so as to discompose the mind'. The 'fixed idea' principle certainly lay at the root of the matter. Godwin40, in relation to these events of 1918, reminds us of the 'paternalistic grip of the Heads of Departments in the early years of this century', and of how difficult it was to induce reforms in the departments 'under Professors who were indeed distinguished scientists, fine teachers and men of great authority'. This 'paternalistic grip' was especially true of departments in the Scottish Universities. Regius Professorships in the 1880s when Bower and Balfour took up their appointments were still ad vitam aut culpam - appointments for life unless some severe misdemeanour (undefined) could be proved and, even then, displacement would be difficult from a legalistic point of view. There are a number of recorded instances in the Glasgow Senate minutes when Bower went on the offensive over some attempted interference in the running of his department. On one notable occasion in the late 1900s he gave a robust response to a distinguished member of the University Court who seemingly failed to appreciate the balance to be struck between teaching and research on the part of staff in the Botany Department. And Bower was a fine teacher. A one-time medical student of the class of 1885, writing some 40 years later, commented that it had been ' a pleasure to listen to one who could not only lecture and teach but to whom one could look up and derive inspiration '*60 The Glasgowv University Magazine of 25 March 1891 (a student publication) included a eulogistic article on Bower. Part of it reads ' Everyone attends Dr Bower's lectures because he can't help attending - would it were so in every class ! The subject is throughout presented with such clearness and minuteness and imbued with such unfailing interest that the lectures in Botany are universally esteemed the best of all courses. ' Such articles could be highly critical of professors of lesser capability. W. H. Lang, a student under Bower in the early 1 890s described him as 'an inspiring teacher'. Later colleagues recalled his 'inspired jawbations' at the start of practical classes 'galvanising the class on the dullest of days '. Bower regarded the teaching of these large</page><page sequence="17">The ' Tansley Manifesto' affair 19 Figure 2. F. 0.

(From a photograph in the possession of the Department of Botany University of Glasgow.) elementary classes as 'sporting events'. Sir Hector Hetherington, Principal of Glasgow University 1936-61, but writing when Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1924, gave some pertinent comments on the large elementary classes in the Scottish Universities. They could be troublesome given the chance, 'But for a teacher who gives clear signs of caring about his students and his subject, no more generous audience could anywhere be found.' This exactly describes Bower's success, which he himself would have attributed not only to presentation but to course content. His own teaching apprenticeship had been at the Normal School of Science in South Kensington under T. H. Huxley. As Lecturer in Botany from 1882-5, he had undoubtedly been touched by 'that flame of interrogation which kept Huxley's biological course molten and moving' (as described by H. G. Wells in his Experiment in Autobiography). The overwhelmingly morphological approach was the one which Bower and others regarded as the most effective means of holding the interest and enthusiasm of the large numbers in both lectures and practical classes, allowing also for the logistics of the preceding organization. It is a well-known maxim that good practical classes ensure good students. Anyone who has taught the morphological component of a present-day first-year course will recognise the success which accompanies a well-organized laboratory course. The very nature of the work involved gives students the opportunity quickly to obtain positive and recordable data. Even the chore of section cutting and staining can be rewarding for them after some practice. Those heads of departments which so vigorously opposed the subordination of the morphological bias of their courses were possibly influenced by the feedback. This to them was the 2-2</page><page sequence="18">20 A. D. Boney only reliable approach which would ensure a good quality of student body for the specialist courses to follow. Many of them were also influenced by a common experience of earlier years at immediate postgraduate level and spent in the flourishing German botanical laboratories of Sachs, de Bary and others. D. H. Scott, recalling his own training under Sachs at Wiirzburg in 1880-2, commented that, for a young botanist of the time, to study in Germany was 'like a pilgrimage to Mecca by a pious Mussulman'.61 It was also from this background that Bower and others derived their lifelong affinities with the Hofmeisterian style life-history studies - which they applied to both their researches and their teaching. The botanical world of 1918 was a small one and, in fairness to the 'Old Guard', they retained throughout their lives a deep love for their subject and a continuing real concern for its well being. It would be equally unfair to suggest that their opposition was solely against anything of a novel nature. They recognized and fully appreciated new and significant discoveries. The excitement amongst them, both in public and in private correspondence, over the discovery of the Rhynie Chert fossils is clear evidence of this. It is perhaps unfortunate that the underlying reasons for the opposition became intertwined with elements of persona which have obscured the genuine argument. The 1920s had started badly for Tansley. The rebuff of the proposals to revise elementary teaching may have been one factor. The failure to obtain the Oxford Chair was probably a more immediate cause of the 'curious aura of loneliness' on his part noted by one young botanist at the 1923 Liverpool meeting of the BAAS. But from 1927 on, there came the period of 'acknowledgement and fulfilment'."4 In 1927, he was appointed to the Oxford Chair after F. W. Keeble (knighted in 1922) became Agricultural Advisor to ICI. Combining as it does a Fellowship at Magdalen College, the ensuing 10 years enabled him fully to develop his views on the teaching of the subject and to foster the growth of ecology. Whilst the pace of this growth may have been disappointing to him in the late 1920s and 1930s, with his own knighthood in 1950 for services to ecology, and the inexorable growth in quantity, quality and importance of ecological studies, a true fulfilment must have been achieved. ACKNOWLED GEMENTS I acknowledge with gratitude the advice, information and encouragement given me by the late Lieutenant General Sir Roger Bower, KCB, KBE, nephew of F.O. Bower, during my amassing of the biographical data on his uncle, of which the present work forms but part. The late Sir Harry Godwin supplied me with valuable personal recollections of the principal 'characters' involved in the 'Manifesto Affair'. Michael Moss, Archivist to the University of Glasgow, earns my gratitude for placing the resources of his department at my disposal. My thanks go also to Norman Tait of the Botany Department, University of Glasgow, for the production of excellent photographs from difficult source materials. I am grateful also to Professor R. G. West, F.R.S., for his encouragement in the preparation of this paper. REFERENCES (G.U.A. = Glasgow University Archives, plus the reference number) 1. BONEY, A. D. (1985).
