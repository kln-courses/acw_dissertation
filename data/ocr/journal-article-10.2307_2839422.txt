LORD [ 156 ]</page><page sequence="2">October, 1921.] MAN. [No. 95. ABERCROMBY. A full programme attracted a large attendance and several of the papers gave rise to animated and valuable discussion. Among the archa3ological papers three dealt.with prehistoric art. PROFESSOR G. BALDWIN BROWN, in discussing the light thrown on the origin and history of art by recent discoveries in the domain of palaeolithic art, pointed out that primitive artistic activities, which play a large part in the life of savages, are of practical use to the individual and the race, and so are in a sense forced on them. They are thus in conflict with the idea of the freedom of artistic activity, the corner stone of current artistic theory. MR. MILES BURKITT described the new find in the Pyrenean cave of Trois Freres of a frieze of engraved animals above which is the figure of a man masked, with stag's antler on his head and a tail, and discussed its meaning and possible affinity with the early Gallic god, always shown as masked, and the Cretan god of Minoan times. MR. LESLIE ARMSTRONG exhibited reproductions of the engraved representations of animals found last year at Grime's Graves in association with implements of Mousterian type. As a preliminary to the excursion made by the members of the Section to Traprain Law, MR. ALEX. 0. CURLE gave an account of this site and its massive earthwork, as well as of the magnificent hoard of fourth century silver plate found there, and believed to have been pillaged from Gaul by Saxon pirates. In.other fields of archaeological research, MR. STANLEY CASSON gave an account of his recent investigations in Macedonia which produced from Chaushitsa and other sites relics of the Iron Age consisting of bronze ornaments, pottery, both wheel- and hand-made, and some gold. MISS MURRAY described excavations which she had recently carried out in Malta, in the course of which a megalithic temple was identified at Boy en Nadur on the Bay of Marsa Scirocco, and the entrance, one apse and the outline of the courtyard revealed. A communication presented on behalf of Dr. T. Ashby, Director of the British School at Rome, gave an account of recent archaeological discoveries in Italy and in Tunisia. These included the further investigation of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and the excavation of an interesting tomb with frescoes belonging to the end of the second century A.D. in Rome itself. At Ostia, where a considerable proportion of the main street has now been laid bare, and at Pompeii, recent discoveries throw much new light on Roman domestic architecture. A large number of votive terra- cottas have been dug up in the Temenos of Demeter Malephorus at Selinus in Sicily. MR. J. WHATMOUGH discussed the functions of Rehtia, the Venetic Goddess of Healing, and suggested that the so-called " nails " and " wedges " associated with the cult are to be explained as a specialised type of hairpin with pendant axe- shaped talismans of the form well known from early Iron Age deposits. He compared the- cult with that of Artemis Orthia at Sparta. Of the communications dealing with ethnographical subjects, the most important were the discussion on Totemism opened by PROFESSOR SIR WILLIAM RIDGEWAY, and two papers by the REV. J. RoscoE, dealing with the results of the Mackie Ethnological Expedition to Uganda. In opening the discussion on Totemism SIR WILLIAM RIDGEWAY said that he had pointed out some years ago that vegetation spirits and totemic beliefs were merely secondary phenomena depending on the primary belief of the continued existence of the soul after death and its transmigration. Further he had been led to the conclusion that the sacredness of certain rocks, trees, plants, etc., depended upon the fact that they were believed to be the abode of the spirit of those who were buried under or near them or were killed near them. In fall regions where t,otemism is known it arises from a like belief. In many, if not all regions, where totemism exists, the bodies of the dead were, and still are, left to be devoured by [ 157 ]</page><page sequence="3">No. 95.] MAN. [October, 1921. wild beasts, and it was believed that their spirits inhabit their devourers. In other cases where the bodies were not devoured, it was still believed that the spirits of the dead entered or dwelt in certain animhals or trees. In the discussion which followed the reading of the paper, DR. RIVERS said that he supported Sir William Ridgeway's conclusion whole-heartedly, but he wished to lay special stress upon the element of reincarnation. Totemic peoples were averse from eating their totem, as it would be cannibalism. The personality of the ancestor from whom the totem had originated must have impressed the com- munity strongly and this suggested that he was the representative of a higher culture from outside the community. DR. HADDON suggested that the hero-cult of Eddystone Island, to which reference had been made, did not cut across the totemic cult, but was probably a graft on an earlier hero or ancester cult. DR. HARTLAND said that Sir W. Ridgeway had not made out his case. The belief in the immortality of the soul was not fundamental, yet he wished to make totemism later than, and dependent upon it. MR. DONALD MACKENZIE pointed out that beliefs connected with holy trees and other objects did not necessarily connote a totemic cult, and MR. MIGEOD referred to the absence of totemism among the tribes of West Africa. MR. RoscoE's first paper dealt with the death ceremonies practised among'the tribes of the lake region of Uganda, which among the Bagesu, in Bunyoro, and in Buganda, are based upon the belief in ghosts-the only supernatural being the native understands. In his second communication he gave a more popular and general account of the results of the expedition, in which' he suggested that the dominant pastoral tribes of Ankole and Bunyoro may be connected with the Galla and through them with ancient Egypt. The expedition was successful in discovering a line of demarkation between the pastoral people of the lake region and the Somali, Nandi and Masai tribes, who are of the same origin. An interesting pendant to Mr. Roscoe's first paper was afforded by an analysis by MR. T. F. MCILWRAITH of African death rites, in which he suggested that the sporadic distribution of the custom of preserving the bodies of chiefs in the Congo and West Africa, sometimes combined with placing the corpse in a coffin, and the anthropomorphic figure in the Congo and West Africa, as well as the occasional use of representations of the deceased, may be due to Egyptian influence which spread inland from an early settlement of sea-farers on the coast. - This wouild account for the absence of similar practices in East Africa; but, alternatively, had the diffusion taken place by land he suggested that this influence had been wiped out in East and North Africa by the arrival of the pastorals. An interesting paper by MR. F. W. H. MIGEOD dealt with mystic and ceremonial avoidance of contact with the ground in Africa. He was not, however, able to suggest one general underlying reason for the custom owing to the diversity of the ceremonial occasions and attendant circumstances in which it is practised. MR. M. W. HILTON-SIMPSON communicated an account of a " water-clock " in the form of a metal bowl with perforated bottom, used in Algeria to regulate the supplv of water in irrigation, for which he suggested a possible derivation dating back to Roman times. DR. W. H. R. RIVERS described the Melanesian system of land-tenure with special reference to Ambryn and Eddystone Island, in which the produce of land held on individual tenure is communal property; while the produce may be taken by the owner's kin without leave, those who are not of his kin must ask permission. MR. LEWIS SPENCE discussed the methods and sources of the study of the religions of Ancient Mexico. In additions to the matters of local interest already mentioned two papers dealt with Scottish folklore. CANON MACCULLOCH, in a communication, relating to [ 158 ]</page><page sequence="4">October, 1921.] MAN. [No. 95. the mingling of fairy and witch beliefs in sixteenth and seventeenth century Scotland, pointed out that this had largely arisen out of the adoption by the people of the common ban placed upon both classes of belief by orthodox ecclesiasticism, on the ground that they were equally connected with the devil and the powers of darkness. MR. DONALD A. MACKENZIE indicated some of the peculiar features in which Scottish folklore differed in particular from that of Ireland and suggested that it contained fragments of ancient mythology and evidence of culture drifting. In physical anthropology, DR. NELSON ANNANDALE gave a demonstration of an interesting series of types forming part of a large collection of photographs made in the Indian Museum, Calcutta, and suggested the desirability of the formation of similar series in other centres: Miss FLEMING pointed out certain directions in which standards of race distinction need to be modified in the case of women, particularly in connection with the ages at which alterations take place in skull form, in shape of forehead, and in coloration. Two interesting discussions were held, of which one, on an Imperial School of Anthropology, was initiated from a communication from SIR RICHARD TEMPLE [see MAN, 1921, No. 93], and the second, on " The Origin of the Scottish People," was opened by SIR ARTHUR KEITH in a joint session with Section E (Geography). He said the inihabitants of the Highlands and western parts of Scotland and the inhabitants of the inland parts of Scandinavia are branches of the same racial (Nordic) stock. The inland inhabitants of Scandinavia are the descendants of the people who settled in Norway and Sweden on the retreat of the last ice-sheet. The modern Highlander is the lineal descendant of the people who reached Scotland at a corresponding period. On the Danish, as also on the Scottish, coasts are found the shell heaps of the " harpoon " folk-the earliest ifnhabitants in the north- western outskirts of Europe in Post-Glacial times. Although their remains have not been found we may safely infer that they arose from the long aind big-headed type of man found in South England and on the Continent at the close of the Ice Age. Thus Scot and Scandinavian are descendants of the late Palseolithic men of South-West Europe. The darker hair and eyes of the modern Scot, as compared with his Scandinavian cousin, may not be due to a later Mediterranean admixture, but to his retaining to a greater degree the complexion of his Paheolithic ancestor. At the beginning of the second millennium B.C. we find Scotland in free communica- tion with Europe by two portals. Through her eastern coasts she was open to the opposite shorelands of the North Sea and to Central Europe. Graves of this period contained the remains of a peculiar and round-headed people. Lord Aber- cromby had traced the designs of their pottery to the upper reaches of the Rhine. Turning to the western door, at this time Ireland and Wales received new settlers from the south-western countries of Europe; but did they reach Scotland? Professor Bryce was of opinion that the people buried in the western megalithic tombs of Scotland represent invaders of the Mediterranean type. They may equally well be considered as the native Nordic people of Scotland; indeed, in such skulls as retain the face there are certain features which suggest a northern origin. There is no definite evidence of any great invasion of Scotland from the second millennium to the arrival of the Romans. The Roman invasion left no appreciable mark on the Scottish people. But in the fifth century, both eastern and western doorways again became open. The Dalriad Scots from the North of Ireland entered by the western portal; they brought no new physical type. For a period of 500 years, Scotland received at her eastern,doorway settlers from lands which were first settled by the " harpoon " people. They brought Teutonic dialects to Scotland, other manners, traditions, and arts, but no physical type of manhood which was new to Scotland. Who were the Picts ? The people of Aberdeenshire were Picts in the ninth [ 159 ]</page><page sequence="5">No. 95.] MAN. [October, 1921. century; there is no reason to question that- the bulk of the present population of that county is their children. An Aberdeenshire man cannot be recognised from another native of Scotland except by his speech. The Picts, Celts. and Saxons of Scotland are all of the one breed-the descendants of the pioneer race which settled North-West Europe when the last ice-sheet lifted. There has been only one intrusive element-the round-head of late Neolithic introduction. PROFESSOR THOMAS H. BRYCE said we have no direct evidence regarding the physical characters of the Azilian inhabitants, but there is a strong presumption that the primitive basis of the population was Nordic in character. Superimposed on this came, first, in late Neolithic times, the men of the chambered cairns; second, the "beaker " folk of the Bronze Age. These three elements, blended in different propor- tions, made up the population of pre-Romain times, since when it has been altered only by the intrusion of similar elements and reassemblage. In S.E. Scotland there are traces of a new element in the Iron Age with a late La Tene culture. It resembles the Gaulish, but the interments -are native, not Gaulish. The distribution of the chambered cairns and burials of the Bronze Age, indicate a grouping of the elements which, taken in conjunction with the movements of historical times, explains the well-known features of the present-day population. LORD ABERCROMBY, in opening the discussion, referred to the large percentage of broad-headedness in skulls from the Island of Borreby, and expressed a doubt as to the incoming of peoples by the direct route across thp North Sea in very early, times. DR. J. F. TOCRER gave a summary of the results of his investigation of the head, form, stature, and pigmentation of the present population of Scotland, which were -based upon observations of 13,000 individuals. He criticised any attempt to arrive at a conclusion as to the physical characters of the Scottish race, on the ground of the relative paucity of data. PROFESSOR R. W. REID said that investigations carried out at Aberdeen UJniversity on young men from the North- East of Scotland showed that they were almost identical in physical character with young men of Norway, while the skeletal remains of the " short cist " or " beaker " folk might be regarded as supporting the theory of a combination of long and broadd- headed types in that area. PROFESSOR JEHU said that man inhabited Scotland when the 45-foot raised beach was formed, for which the accepted date was 10,000 years ago. It was dangerous to speak of the physical character of the "harpoon " men, or to say that they came from Scandinavia, in the absence of data. In a contribution from PROFESSOR W. S. WATSON dealing with the evidence of place-names, it was suggested that as early as the fourth century B.C. the language of Scotland was Celtic, and that the rulers of the dark population, forming the bulk of the-inhabitants, belonged to the tall, fair-haired, blue-eyed type. MR. H. J. E. PEAKE deprecated the loose use of the term " Nordic," which should be confined to the taJl, fair, gray or blue-eyed people, whose chief characteristics were strength, courage, activity,, and an intense affection for the horse. Such a people could not be derived from a sedentary coastal population such as the harpoon folk, but only from a people which had evolved in an open country in which the horse could be tamed and trained. He had suggested that the broad-headed element in early Scandinavia was Mongoloid, and derived from Asia, and that this element repre- sented the " harpoon " folk. PROFESSOR FLEURE suggested that a more detailed examination of the present population of Scotland, especially in the remoter districts, might reveal nests- of early types representing survivals of Palasolithic man such as the Aurignacian, corresponding to the survivals which he himself had discovered in Wales. AMR. D. MACKE;NZIE pointed out that M. Breuil had distin- guished three drifts into Scotland. It was necessary to keep clearly ;in mind the distinction between the Maglemose and Azilian harpoons; while the latter were made of horn, the former were made of bone.
