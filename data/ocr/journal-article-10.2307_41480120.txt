This, however, has not been achieved. There is an urgent need for critical examination of the long-term consequences of grafting American academic practices onto a Chinese base. This article examines the tensions in the interactions in higher education between the traditional Chinese and the imposed Western modes of thinking. Bor- rowing a definition of the structure of culture, this paper reveals the various extents to which layers of Chinese higher education have achieved any degree of success. It finds that with a strong catch-up mentality, China's contemporary higher education policies are responsive to Western influences. These are however only applied as panic- stricken and expedient band-aid remedies, rather than as strategies based on sys- tematic understanding of cultural contexts. Accordingly, Chinese universities are uncritical towards the European-American model and its variants. This article warns that without an infusion of traditional education values, universities in China risk losing touch with their cultural contexts in their quest for world-class status.

Yang rassemble des éléments des héritages philosophiques de la Chine et de l'Occident. Cet objectif n'a cependant pas été atteint. Il est nécessaire de procéder d'urgence à un examen critique des conséquences à long terme d'une greffe des pratiques universitaires améri- caines sur une base chinoise. Cet article examine les tensions existant dans les interactions de l'enseignement supérieur entre la Chine traditionnelle et les modes de pensée occi- dentaux imposés. Empruntant une définition de la structure culturelle, l'auteur expose dans quelle mesure les différents niveaux de l'enseignement supérieur chinois ont obtenu des succès à divers degrés. Il constate que, fortement marquées par une mentalité de rattrapage, les politiques actuelles de l'enseignement supérieur chinois sont réceptives aux influences occidentales. Mais ces politiques sont appliquées exclusivement à titre de remèdes administrés sous l'effet de la panique et sous forme d'expédients de fortune, au lieu de stratégies fondées sur une interprétation systématique des contextes culturels. En conséquence, les universités chinoises manquent d'esprit critique à l'égard du modèle euro-américain et de ses variantes. L'auteur avertit que, à moins d'insuffler les valeurs éducatives traditionnelles, les universités chinoises courent le risque de se couper de leurs contextes culturels dans leur quête d'un statut de niveau international. Zusammenfassung Das Ich und das Andere im kulturellen Kontext des Konfuzi- anismus: Was bedeutet die Entwicklung der Hochschulausbildung in China für die Komparatistik? - Bislang besteht das zentrale Anliegen der modernen Hochschulaus- bildung in China in der Kombination chinesischer und westlicher Elemente auf allen Ebenen, unter anderem für institutionelle Regelungen, Forschungsmethoden, Bil- dungsideale und Kulturgeist, einer Kombination, die verschiedene Aspekte des philosophischen Erbes aus China und dem Westen zusammenführt. Dies ist jedoch nicht erreicht worden. Es bedarf dringend einer kritischen Untersuchung, welche langfristi- gen Folgen es hat, wenn wissenschaftliche Gepflogenheiten Amerikas auf chinesische Grundlagen aufgepfropft werden. In diesem Artikel wird das Spannungsfeld zwischen den traditionellen chinesischen und den aufgezwungenen westlichen Denkweisen in der Hochschulausbildung untersucht. Anhand einer entlehnten Definition von Kultur- struktur zeigt dieser Artikel auf, inwieweit die drei Schichten der chinesischen Hochschulausbildung erfolgreich sind. Ein Ergebnis ist, dass die derzeitige Hoch- schulpolitik Chinas von einer starken Aufholmentalität geprägt ist und auf westliche Einflüsse reagiert. In die Praxis umgesetzt wird sie jedoch nicht in Form von Strategien, die auf dem systematischen Verständnis des kulturellen Kontexts basieren, sondern lediglich als von Panik getriebene und auf einen unmittelbaren Zweck hin ausgerichtete Behelfsmaßnahmen. Dementsprechend sind chinesische Universitäten gegenüber dem europäisch-amerikanischen Modell und dessen Abwandlungen unkritisch. In diesem Artikel wird davor gewarnt, dass Universitäten in China bei ihrem Streben nach einer Position an der Weltspitze Gefahr laufen, den Kontakt mit ihrem kulturellen Kontext zu verlieren, wenn sie die traditionellen Werte der Bildung außer Acht lassen. Resumen En sí mismo y en los demás, en el contexto cultural confuciano: impli- caciones del desarrollo de la educación superior de China para estudios comparativos - El objetivo central de la educación superior moderna de China ha sido combinar elementos chinos y occidentales en todos los niveles, incluyendo estructuras institu- cionales, metodologías de investigación, ideales educativos y espíritu cultural, en una Springer</page><page sequence="3">Self and the other in the Confucian cultural context 339 combinación que reúna los legados filosóficos de China y de Occidente. Sin embargo, este objetivo no se ha alcanzado. Es urgentemente necesario someter a un examen crítico las consecuencias que, a largo plazo, producen los injertos de prácticas aca- démicas norteamericanas en una base china. En este trabajo, el autor examina las tensiones que se producen en la educación superior con la interacción entre modos de pensar tradicionales chinos y aquellos impuestos, occidentales. Sirviéndose de una definición de la estructura cultural, este trabajo revela los diferentes grados de éxito que han logrado los legisladores de la educación superior china. El autor comprueba que, por una marcada tendencia de buscar la actualidad, las políticas contemporáneas chinas para la educación superior son muy permeables a las influencias occidentales. Sin embargo, estas solo se aplican como parches y soluciones de emergencia, más que como estrategias basadas en una comprensión sistemática de contextos culturales. Así, las universidades chinas no son críticas frente al modelo europeo-norteamericano y sus variantes. El autor advierte en este trabajo que, si no se infunden en ellas valores educativos tradicionales, las universidades en China corren peligro de perder el con- tacto con su contexto cultural en el afán por conseguir una categoría de clase mundial. Резюме «Эго и другие» в конфуцианском культурном контексте: результаты развития высшего образования в Китае в сравнительных исследованиях - Основной целью современного высшего образования в Китае является объединить китайские и западные элементы на всех уровнях, включая институциональную организацию, методологию исследований, образовательные идеалы и культурный дух - то сочетание, которое соединяет китайское и западное философское наследия. Тем не менее, это еще не достигнуто. Наблюдается острая необходимость критически пересмотреть долгосрочные последствия трансплантации американской образовательной практики на китайскую основу. В данной статье исследуются напряженные моменты во взаимоотношениях в высшем образовании, которые имеют место между традиционным китайским и привносимым западным менталитетом. Заимствуя дефиницию структуры культуры, в данной статье показывается, насколько различные пласты высшего образования в Китае достигли какого- либо успеха. Отмечается, что современная политика высшего образования в Китае, обладая сильным менталитетом в духе «догнать соперника», остро реагирует на влияние Запада. Это, тем не менее, является ответом охваченного паникой общества и целесообразным средством оказания помощи, а не стратегией, основанной на систематическом понимании культурных контекстов. Таким образом, китайские университеты не выражают критику в отношении европейской и американской модели и ее вариантов. Автор данной статьи предостерегает о том, что без отстаивания традиционных образовательных ценностей университеты в Китае, претендующие на получение мирового статуса, рискуют потерять связь со своим культурным контекстом.

With intensified globalisation, "context matters" (Crossley with Jarvis 2001) even more. While the critical role of context has been widely recognised (Yang 2007), a general stress on the importance of context does not suffice. Context means different things to different people. Indeed, inconsistencies in the use of context are common in the literature of comparative and international education. They can even be found within the same piece of work. Focusing on the researcher, context has much to do with positionality, dealing with issues of being an insider or an outsider. Early thinkers insisted on the need for and the possibility of distinguishing between "natives" and strangers, because in their view the differences between the researchers and the researched were obvious (see, for example, Mead 1929). However, the distinctions become blurred when research is conducted in a familiar context of the researchers' "culture, gender, religions, residential and ethnic backgrounds" (Hockey 1993, p. 201). In an era of a global cultural economy with increasing disjuncture and differences (Appadurai 1990), this issue becomes even more problematic. The insider-outsider dichotomy does not always help. Individuals from one community with access to a particular form of cultural cognition do not naturally attach authority to this cognition (Kreiger 1982). Outsiders do not necessarily see less. Indeed, they could see more by avoiding the familiar scenario that when people are extremely close to something they tend not to perceive its actual features. In this sense, outsiderness can shed light on information that may otherwise have been overlooked (Bridges 2001). Moreover, individuals do not have a single status only. Instead, they have set of statuses (Merton 1972). A key concern is the relationship between one's own cultural cognition and that of the culturally different society one is studying. Individual researchers need to be aware of their own cultural conditioning, keen not to overlook the different cognitive frameworks of the researched, and address questions about their beliefs and attitudes through appropriate lenses. Context is multidimensional. Comparative education researchers usually pay much attention to social, cultural, economic and political contexts. Among the various dimensions, culture has been the most prominent and has attracted particular interest, although the term itself remains one of the most elusive entities in social research and has often been misunderstood and misused. One of the most cited definitions is by Dutch anthropologist Geert Hofstede (1981), who defines culture as "the collective programming of the human mind that distinguishes the members of one human group from those of another." Culture therefore is "a system of collectively held values" (p. 24). Such a functionalist bipolar paradigm of analysing national cultures (see, for example, Hofstede 1991, 2001) has long been dominant in the field of international cross-cultural education. Dividing national cultures into individualist or collectivist types represents a static and deterministic vision of culture; this view has increasingly come to be at odds with today's global cross- cultural education environment. Springer</page><page sequence="5">Self and the other in the Confucian cultural context 341 Cultural context needs to be viewed as layered, with three aspects included in culture in its anthropological sense: material, social (institutional) and ideological. Built on Liang Shuming's three aspects of culture-material, social and spiritual life (Cao 1994), Pang Pu (1986) coined the term "the structure of culture" (p. 25). A culture, regardless of its type, stage or evolution, consists of three layers: on the outside there is the material layer; at the core (the deepest level) is the psychological or ideological layer; in the middle is the combination of the two: materialised ideology, such as theory, system and behaviour. This view is particularly useful in the studies of cross-cultural interactions of educational theory, policy and practice. According to this, culture is never static. Contacts and communication between cultures begin at the material level and gradually influence social and ideological culture. As material culture is constantly progressing, social and ideological culture are also changing. Culture at the third level is deeply rooted in a nation's tradition and ideology and is resistant to change. It is this relative stability of the core aspect of culture which makes it possible to discuss the variations of culture. But being stable does not mean that it is static. History moves forward; so does culture. For comparative studies, the way people view others and how they interact with the natural world have significant implications. The science or art of comparative analysis treads the space between self and other (Welch 2010). According to Richard Nisbett (2003), independent and interdependent thinking are allied respectively to people of North American and East Asian culture. Utilising comparative analysis of how Westerners and East Asians viewed the world within an animated simulation of the view in a fish tank, he found that East Asians tended to pay much more attention to the background elements in the animated vignette, rather than focusing primarily on the fish which comprised much of the foreground of the scene. Asians viewed the world through a wide angle lens, whereas Westerners had tunnel vision. Asians were faster in identifying the existence of and changes in relationships between objects or events within the background of a scene, and were more "field dependent" than Westerners in making a judgment of a situation, requiring context to be able to make an evaluation in the first place. Their cultural thinking has significant implications for how they treat foreign educational experiences. For example, the Japanese reaction to US policy suggestions during the American occupation after World War П contrasted markedly with the German attitude: while the former followed almost all the advice, the latter made highly selective choices. Another way of cultural thinking that exerts great impact on educational development and by extension possesses implications for comparative studies concerns attitudes towards the natural world. Here, Chinese and Anglo-Saxon cultures serve as telling examples. While Chinese sages have always taught people to concentrate on human society only, their Anglo-Saxon counterparts have been committed to exploring nature. Therefore, unlike outward-looking Western thinking, the central focus of the Chinese way of thinking has been inward- looking, confined almost exclusively to human behaviour. Such different orienta- tions of cultural thinking have led to different historical trajectories of higher education. In the case of China's higher education development, the dilemma is that while Chinese culture's lack of interest in exploring the natural world led to a Springer</page><page sequence="6">342 R. Yang unique higher education tradition which fundamentally contradicts Western thought, interdependent Chinese cultural thinking has fostered a social and policy environment ready to widely accept the dominant European-North American university model in China, as shown later. Hajime Nakamura once remarked that "while every individual is affected by the quickening flow of world events, he is still strongly influenced by the way of living and thinking in his own nation and culture" (Nakamura 1964, p. 3). With increasingly intensified globalisation, the flow of world events has only become more rapid, while individuals remain greatly influenced by their ways of cultural thinking. This is especially the case for people working at cultural institutions such as universities. However, contemporary comparative and international studies of higher education reforms have been overwhelmed by the powerful influence of economic and political realities. Focusing on the impact of Chinese traditional ways of viewing self, the other and nature on higher education development, this article traces contemporary practices to their historical and cultural roots, and delves deep into current reform endeavours. It reveals that China's rich traditional culture has caused great difficulty in indigenising the imposed Western concept of the university. Chinese cultural thinking and its impact on higher education development When first encountering The Book of Changes (Л13),1 the late great Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) expressed his surprise why a people as intelligent as the Chinese since early times should have failed to develop what we call science and technology today. To me, the reason lies in differences in cultural thinking. While ancient Western thinkers endeavoured to explore the outside world, such as the obsession of ancient Greek philosophers with celestial phenomena, their Chinese counterparts chose an inward-looking path. As posited by the Confucian philosopher Mencius, people would understand the natural world perfectly if they understood themselves well. This reflects important differences in how the two cultures comprehend human action in the world. Understanding oneself as being part of the world instead of being outside it, the Chinese worldview does not view humans as distinct from the world (Henkel 2006). Unlike the emphasis in the origins of Western culture on exploration of the natural world - moving from nature to the human world - Chinese culture has centred on humans, moving from humans to nature. There is no severe dichotomy between theory and practice in Chinese thought. The Chinese view the world as continual and in process. According to François Jullien (2004, p. 189), the basic difference between Western and Chinese thought is that "one constructs a model that is then projected 1 The Book of Changes , also known as the Classic of Changes or I Ching , is one of the oldest Chinese classic texts. It contains a divination system comparable to Western geomancy. Its earliest extant version was written on bamboo slips, and dates from the latter half of the Warring States period (mid-4th to early 3rd century ВС. The text was later reinterpreted as a system of cosmology and philosophy that subsequently became intrinsic to Chinese culture. It centred on the ideas of the dynamic balance of opposites, the evolution of events as a process and acceptance of the inevitability of change. â Springer</page><page sequence="7">Self and the other in the Confucian cultural context 343 onto the situation, which implies that the situation is momentarily 'frozen'. The other relies on a disposition that is known to be constantly evolving." Noting the different relation of humans to nature in the West and in the East as one of the salient contrasts between the two civilisations, John King Fairbank wrote: Man has been in the center of the Western stage. The rest of nature has served as neutral background or as his adversary. Thus Western religion is anthropomorphic and early Western painting anthropocentric. To see how great this gulf is we have only to compare Christianity with the relative impersonality of Buddhism, or a Sung landscape and its tiny human figures dwarfed by crags and rivers with an Italian primitive in which nature is an afterthought (Fairbank 1983, p. 14). Such a mode of thinking has had a strong impact on the historical development of China's higher education. Firstly, focusing almost exclusively on human society in close relationship with the ruling class, it led to the unique historical roots of Chinese higher education which had evolved according to its own logic and never deviated from its developmental path, despite external influences. By the 18th century, China had developed a unique set of scholarly values over its 2,000 years of imperial history. Over such a long process, its higher education circles confined their dissemination of knowledge to the provincial level and persisted in disregarding knowledge about anything in the rest of the world. There was no institution in Chinese tradition that could be called a university. Instead, the imperial examination system2 and the academies or shuyuan3 were key elements of ancient Chinese higher learning (Hay hoe 1996, p. 10). With the diffusion of the European university model throughout much of the world under conditions of imperialism and colonialism in the 19th century, China's higher education could have taken the lead in introducing and assimilating advanced culture, science and technology to promote social and economic development. Instead, due to its exclusivity, Chinese higher education continued to train traditional Confucian scholars with little knowledge of the outside world. Although Western higher education models had already demonstrated their strength, China's communication with the West was deliberately inhibited. Chinese higher education within the period laid stress solely on the training of scholars with an encyclopaedic knowledge based on Confucian values, which in practice served only the aristocracy (Yang 2002). The Confucian scholars acquired the education that symbolised their social status. 2 The imperial examination system began to take shape around AD 400 and reached its full institutional development in the Tang dynasty (AD 618-907). During the Song dynasty (AD 960-1279), it crystallised into patterns that were to last right up to 191 1. For more information, see Ruth Hay hoe' s (1996) Chinas Universities 1895-1995 , especially page 10. The academies or shuyuan took their definitive shapes in the Song dynasty, as what had originally been libraries or centres for scholarly discussion developed into academies that provided a structured learning environment separate from, yet interacting with, state institutions associated with the civil service examination system. For more information see Hayhoe (1996, p. 11). Springer</page><page sequence="8">344 R. Yang Secondly, lacking an interest in seeking knowledge for its own sake, traditional Chinese higher education placed its central focus on utility, in the terms of the ruling classes. After unifying China, the Qin dynasty (221-206 ВС) banned private schooling, allowing students to be taught only by officials and made imperial power supreme. Emperor Wu of Han 156-87 ВС) adopted the advice of Dong Zhongshu (iSíŤfíř, 179-104 ВС) to revere only Confucianism and dismissed all the Hundred Schools of Thought {ЩЖЩШ, Dong recommended Taixue as the best place to inculcate Confucianism (Ш№)5 (Meng 1996, p. 140), a place not only to train talents, but also to exert influence and select political personnel. Meanwhile, Gongsun Hong 200-121 ВС), the then prime minister, suggested the government establish a system of scholars with disciples (filili J® ), so that local communities would be positively influenced while talent was rewarded. Emperor Wu took their advice, and ordered the establishment of the imperial academy of Taixue in 124 ВС to host scholars and their students, with a hope that they would set a good example for society as a whole. Taixue taught Confucianism (Ebrey 1999). Even after only one year of study at Taixue with mastery of one classic, students were already eligible to be chosen by the government to become officials. By sö doing, the government directly controlled their political future. This was the beginning of China's strong tradition for more than 2,000 years - higher education aiming at preparing would-be officials for the state. Taixue thus became a subsidiary body of the bureaucratic system (Zhang 2009, p. 18). As part of the ruling system, Taixue neither could nor attempted to go beyond the imperial framework. The first nationwide government school system in China was established in AD 3 under Emperor Ping of Han, with Taixue at the top located in the capital of Chang' an (Yuan 1994). Later, it was replaced by the imperial academy of Guozijian (HI"? Sì) as the top educational institution and as the highest authority overseeing the national government school system. The develop- ment of Taixue and Guozhijian was thus confined to the limited range possible under their Confucian ideologies. Some sinologists (for example, Hay hoe 1989) see the academies (# l?rc) as an essential element of traditional Chinese higher education, stressing their private nature and freethinking atmosphere. Such features, however, were not always 4 The Hundred Schools of Thought (literally all philosophers and a hundred schools) flourished from 770 to 221 ВС in an era of China's great cultural and intellectual expansion. Although the period was fraught with chaos and bloody battles, it is also known as the Golden Age of Chinese philosophy because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely, a phenomenon later coined the Contention of a Hundred Schools of Thought. The thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced lifestyles and social consciousness up to the present day in East Asian countries. The intellectual society of this era was characterised by itinerant scholars, often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of government, war and diplomacy. The period ended with the rise of the Qin Dynasty and the subsequent purge of dissent. 5 The aim of this process is to spread the authoritative Confucian ideology among the populace and to ensure a dominant position for the ideology. Some scholars also refer to it as Confucianism edification. According to Confucianism, the ultimate aim of education is to penetrate Confucian morals to the grass roots. To achieve this, schools at different levels were naturally the main channel with the Confucian ideology as the only teaching content. Springer</page><page sequence="9">Self and the other in the Confucian cultural context 345 maintained. Sitting somewhere between the private and the official, the academies emerged in the late Tang dynasty and thrived from the Song to the Qing dynasties. Their long-standing historical development bore a marked brand of ideological and financial control by the government. Initially they focused more on exploring Confucianism and personal intellectual cultivation than training government officials, with operating funds coming mainly from private donors. Such conditions, which could have become appropriate seed and soil for Western-style universities to grow, did not last long. In the Song dynasty, they became prosperous through winning recognition and financial support from the government. The government extended its control via donations of books and land. With gradual loss of independence from the government, the academies reached their peak during the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279), became a major part of the govern- ment education system, and trained many officials. They were integrated into the government school system from the Yuan to the Qing dynasties, from the appointment of lecturers to examinations, admissions and the location where the students ended up. By the Qing dynasty (1644-191 1/12), their major aim had turned to preparation for the imperial examination in the hope of winning an official rank (Zhang 2009, pp. 18-19). Therefore, China started its modern higher education system with a fundamen- tally different relationship between the state and educational institutions from that of European medieval universities, leading to a strong tradition of the alliance between education and politics in Chinese history. Ancient Chinese educational institutions have been far too reliant on their relations with the ruling elites. It is remarkable to see how these traditional ways of thinking have survived dramatic social and cultural changes in China's modern history, and how they remain deeply rooted among the Chinese people. It is precisely because of this that their impact on contemporary Chinese higher education is amazingly profound. In stark comparison, medieval universities did not emphasise their physical spaces. Instead, they were a collection of individuals banded together as a universitas. They were autonomous corporations of students and masters, governed by internal rules set by the academic community itself and protected from the outset by Pope Gregory IX' s bull. They were self-financing, depending either on their properties or on contributions from students for their income. They were small, independent institutions catering to the elite and governed by their own members, who elected a rector (Mora 2001). Several distinct features distinguished Taixue and Guozijian from their counterparts in Europe: (1) their teaching staff received a government salary; (2) they took major classical texts of the Confucian school as their curricular content and (3) their teaching approaches included mainly lectures and self-study, with little argumentation. Attempts to indigenise the Western concept of the university The strikingly different cultural roots and heritages have led to continuous conflicts between the traditional Chinese and the imposed Western system. Modern higher education systems have rarely been successfully practised in the non-Western Springer</page><page sequence="10">346 R. Yang world, due to the constant tensions between the formal (visible), institutionalised and the informal (invisible yet powerful) systems within universities in non-Western countries, leading to overall ineffectiveness. This is particularly true in China: while Chinese higher education has fundamentally operated within the traditional mode of thinking, the Western concept of the modern university has been taken on by the Chinese for its usefulness. Such a stiff mix is not always questioned thoughtfully. To China, modern universities are an imported concept. They originated in Europe, spreading worldwide from the mid- 19th century to the present time mainly due to colonialism. Even the countries that escaped colonial domination adopted Western models (Altbach 2001). The European-North American university model has never been tolerant towards any other alternatives, leading to inefficacy of universities in non-Western societies. Attempts to indigenise the Western idea of a university started, in a piecemeal way, with Matteo Ricci's arrival in China in 1582, which was the prologue to a massive play of China's embrace of Western learning. Educational ideas from the West were introduced to the then still highly Sino-centric Chinese society by missionaries including Ernst Faber (1839-99), Timothy Richard (1845-1919), William Alexander Parsons Martin (1827-1916) and Young John Allen (1836-1907). While they attracted little attention from mainstream Chinese thinkers, a few open-mined scholars such as Wei Yuan (ШШ) and Xu Guangqi (ШтШО began to explore Western universities. Based on academic institutions in their home countries, some of the missionaries established universities in China (Jin 2000, p. 10). Many others were heavily involved in the growth of Chinese modern universities. Charles Daniel Tenney, for example, was invited by Sheng Xuanhuai (;® el tlí) in 1895 to be the Dean of Studies at Peiyang University (jb#^C^) and remained at the post for 1 1 years. Modelled on Harvard and Yale, Peiyang University focused almost exclusively on practical subjects, with all its facilities imported from the United States. It trained many much-needed engineers, with a reiterated Pragmatist orientation. Its success was greatly due to the high official rank and great influence of its founder. The Opium Wars (1839-1842 and 1856-1860), resulting from disputes over trade and diplomatic relations between China and the British Empire, forced more Chinese to open their eyes. Guo Songtao ($1ШШ), China's first ambassador, was sent to England in 1876. He observed British universities carefully during his two-year stay there. While most in the Qing government, including his own deputy in the United Kingdom, still held the "foreign craft" in contempt, Guo developed a far better understanding of the values underlying British universities and the vital role played by universities in nation-building (Fan 2002, p. 250). Echoing Guo was Yan Fu (ШШ), who saw more fundamental roles of education. He correctly pointed out that scientific rationality was the essence of Western learning, and called for a scientific spirit among the Chinese people. Such an understanding exerted wide and profound influence on Chinese intellectuals. Efforts to indigenise the Western university model succeeded to varying degrees at various levels. Achievements were most evident at the individual level. Chinese thinkers, such as Cai Yuanpei (ШтьШ) and Hu Shi (#Щ), never stopped trying to combine the Chinese with the Western model ever since the 19th century. â Springer</page><page sequence="11">Self and the other in the Confucian cultural context 347 Cai Yuanpei deserves the highest tribute in this regard. Believing that education was the only way to rejuvenate China (Cai 1997, p. 94), he went to Germany in 1907 to obtain actual experience and enrolled at Leipzig University where he took courses in philosophy, aesthetics, anthropology and experimental psychology. He studied all aspects of German universities, from their historical and philosophical roots to daily operation, combining theoretical inquiry with personal experience and first-hand observation. He introduced German classical ideas of a university into China, and was able to undertake a courageous experiment when he was appointed Minister of Education by the government in 1911 and Chancellor of Peking University in 1917. His momentous years transformed the university from an official institution of the Qing dynasty, already rotten in thought and action despite the fact that it had been established only recently, into a modern institution (Yang 2009). At Peking University, he strongly advocated freethinking principles and an all-embracing approach, which are now seen as the most fundamental characteristics of Peking University. Built on the work done by Xue Fucheng (¡^?@йй) and Zheng Guanying (HřHiSS) during the last decade of the 19th century, Cai introduced the Humboldtian system into China. The system was a product of German Idealism and defined research as the main role of the university (Mora 2001). His success as a leader of a university was unprecedented and is still without parallel nearly a century later. John Dewey even set a higher value on Cai' s remarkable leadership in comparison with the presidents of the most prestigious American and British universities (Feng 1992). Cai' s efforts focused mainly on typifying the transformation of Chinese education from ancient to modern form, giving expression to conflicts and integration between traditional and modern, and remoulding Peking University into a Western-model institution which is established by the government while being tied in many ways to the traditional system. His attempt was to combine the Chinese educational spirit, especially Confucian and Mohist character building, with Western systems. He was joined by a few like-minded others such as his successor Hu Shi, as well as Mei Yiqi (president of Tsinghua University) and Zu Kezheng (president of Zhejiang University). However, none of the followers were able to accomplish as much as he had. An example of institutional success despite extreme hardships during this period is the National Southwestern Associated University (ШШ®^ in Kunming, which merged the three major national Universities of Tsinghua, Peking and Nankai when the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out between China and Japan in 1937. Over the eight years of war (1937-1945), the institution became famous nationwide for having and producing many of China's most prominent academics, scholars, scientists and intellectuals. In addition to struggling for physical survival, its staff and students spent the war years striving to uphold a model of higher education, based largely on the American model, in which modern universities sought to preserve liberal education, political autonomy and academic freedom. Within three years of victory in the war of resistance over the Japanese, the majority of the university community had returned to its north China campuses in Beijing and Tianjin, and was prepared to accept communist rule. Successful in the face of wartime privations, enemy air raids and political pressure from the ruling party, the £) Springer</page><page sequence="12">348 R. Yang University's constituent universities eventually succumbed to communist rule. By 1952, the University's ideal had been largely replaced with a highly politicised and technocratic model borrowed from the Soviet Union. Academic freedom and world- class qualities in teaching and research soon belonged to the past. At the system level, the period of 1911, when the Republic of China was established, to 1927, when Chiang Kai-shek unified China and proclaimed the establishment of the Nationalist government, saw the first real effort to set up a "university" in the sense of the defining values of autonomy and academic freedom. Within this period, a tremendous range of new higher education institutions also emerged and flourished. Different strands of China's own evolving traditions linked up with various foreign influences, with America replacing Japan as the most favoured source of influence. Ruth Hayhoe (1996, p. 43) has rightly and sharply pointed out that the lack of central government provided Chinese higher education with the possibility of vigorous experimentation. It is also important to add that many Chinese scholars who returned from Western countries and Japan played a critical role in the development of higher education in China. Educational thought gradually matured, with eclectic foreign influences, particularly from America and Europe. What needs to be emphasised is that it is not purely accidental that these relative successes were all achieved while the Chinese nation was plunged into an abyss of suffering. Although unfortunate and ironic, it shows the extremely limited space allowed by strong Chinese traditions for higher education institutions to manoeuvre in. While the successes at system and institutional levels were achieved when the state had little time and energy for them, Cai Yuanpei's success was largely due to his most senior status within the ruling party as one of the founders. His success story could hardly be replicated by others. Instead of creating a magic mechanism to delink university operation from the government, his achievement was made possible because of his personal relationship with the highest officials. Within a decade after his departure from Peking University in 1919, his influence weakened. Since then, government control over universities has become even tighter. Having lost their independence in the political system, universities are administered just like the other organs of the Chinese administrative machine. The conflict between traditional Chinese emphasis on political pragmatism and the classical persistence in ontological significance of knowledge from the West never blended well. The ideal to integrate Chinese and Western ideas never materialised. Dominated by a mentality of catching up, the search for such integration has been, consciously and unconsciously, left aside and overshadowed by urgent practical demands. Unfinished business: integrating Chinese and Western ideas of a university The idea of the university is arguably the West's most successful export to the rest of the world. Elements of universities' long historical traditions directly affect global higher education and relations among academic institutions internationally. The export of the university, fuelled particularly by the rise and dominance of the English language, has helped the West effectively dominate world scholarship and ô Springer</page><page sequence="13">Self and the other in the Confucian cultural context 349 cultural development ever since the global spread of the European-North American university model. China is no exception. The Western model influences the direction of change in Chinese institutions of higher education. Shifting from their previous reliance on the Soviet experience, Chinese universities today look to the most elite American counterparts for standards, policy innovation and solutions to their own development problems. The merging of Chinese and Western ideas of a university remains an unfinished business. Contemporary university reforms in China are a combination of externally imposed standards forcing China to adopt international (usually Western, and often American) modes of education and administration, as well as voluntary and even enthusiastic acceptance of foreign standards of academic excellence. Most of the international models for reform used by Chinese universities are based on the American experience and gained through educational exchange. This is particularly the case for the most prestigious universities. For example, the proposed personnel reform at Peking University has been based almost entirely on the perceived US experience (Yang 2009). The grafting of American policies onto Chinese university structure is not always built on sound understanding of the cultural differences involved (Mohrman 2008, p. 42). In this sense, Gan Yang's accusation of Peking University reformer Zhang Weiying's shortage of US higher education experience on the one hand, and his almost entire reliance on the American experience on the other, is relevant. He remarked: The more the Beida [Peking University] reform plan advertises emulation of the United States, the more often it reveals the absence of a fundamental understanding of the American system on the part of the people in charge at Beida ...I can almost say with certainty that Mr. Zhang Weiying has never read any books about the American tenure system; otherwise he should know that the so-called "up-or-out" that he loves to cite is actually a simplified version of the regular statement "seven years up-or-out rule," sometimes also enunciated as "six years up-or-out," the meaning of which is "if you're not promoted in seven years, you go," or "if you're not promoted in six years, you go." This is because the probationary period at the great majority of American universities does not exceed seven years. (Gan 2005, p. 72) Like other reformers at Peking University such as Min Weifang (2004) who cites almost exclusively Harvard and Stanford Universities to legitimise adopting their policy moves, and states repeatedly that American research universities are the best in the world, Zhang Weiying (2004) enumerated the reasons for granting tenure to full professors and some excelling associate professors in his book The Logic of the University. He borrowed foreign experience, especially American practice, to argue that by doing so, established professors would be provided with a security so that they could concentrate on their long-term basic research rather than work for quick success and instant benefits. He also emphasised the use of the tenure policy to give young junior academics some hope and initiative to work harder and better. However, the foreign tenure policy lost its real meaning when it was borrowed by Zhang. According to Chen Pingyuan (2006), the tenure policy promoted by the American Association of University Professors and the Association of University Springer</page><page sequence="14">350 R. Yang Teachers in Britain, set up respectively in 1915 and 1919, was motivated neither by economic benefits nor by lifelong employment, but was designed to protect ideological and academic freedom. It is a natural part of the long-standing idea of the university and shares the same roots with the modern university. It is neither a favour from nor a useful tool for university authorities. Gan Yang offered similar criticism of the proposed plan's failure to express any serious interest in protecting academic freedom. According to him, such a failure was not accidental. It showed that the advocates of the proposed reform were short of the necessary knowledge of the policies practised in the USA and the UK, something that had ironically been used by them to legitimise their reform plan. Like Chen Pingyuan, he insisted that the tenure systems in American and British universities were designed to protect academic freedom instead of advocating market competition. In his eyes, the proposed reform plan at Peking University "has neither taken the clear and rational American system into serious consideration, nor has it taken reference from the sensible British system" (Gan 2003, p. 11). Instead, the proposed reform at Peking University aped the practices at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, which is another American model in Hong Kong. To Gan Yang, this was particularly unfortunate, as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology was the least suitable model for Peking University. He remarked: First, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology is a brand-new university, with its first enrolment in October 1991. It does not have any problems with the unqualified academic staff members appointed previously. Secondly, the University enjoyed abundant funding right from the beginning, with a budget of HK$3.5 billion approved by the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Finally, it is primarily a university of technology and science, without undergraduate students enrolled in the humanities and social sciences. This is a stark contrast to an old university like Peking University which is particularly renowned for its humanities. (Gan 2003, pp. 13-14) The wholesale adoption of US plans may not be totally appropriate for a country with a very different history and cultural traditions. At a minimum, Chinese universities could benefit from studying the problems which have plagued American universities, learning from the examples of what not to do in the effort to reform China's higher education institutions (Mohrman 2005). There is an urgent need for critical examination of the long-term consequences of grafting American academic practices onto a Chinese base. American higher education is rooted in its history, culture and social needs to serve the American society. With strikingly different cultural values and heritages, the Chinese need to look at knowledge and its production outside China more critically. Another illustrative example of unfinished business is constituted by China's contemporary higher education policies, which demonstrate Deng Xiaoping' s strategy of "groping for stones to cross the river" (Ш115ЩШМ). Here, ideologies are less important. Discussions dealing with social and cultural conflicts between Chinese and foreign educational values have declined both on the policy agenda and in practice, especially since the 1990s, thus in effect shelving traditional differences â Springer</page><page sequence="15">Self and the other in the Confucian cultural context 35 1 in educational values. What was stressed most was the possible educational contribution to economic growth. By the 1980s, China had incorporated a series of measures from foreign experiences including decentralisation and market mecha- nisms, without exploring the institutional support for and the ideological foundations of these approaches, which seemed to be effective only in a few major Anglo-Saxon societies. While the structure of Chinese education remained largely based on the former Soviet model, the reforms were clearly American-oriented (Hayhoe 1989). Little serious work was done to explore whether American branches could be effectively grafted on a Soviet tree planted in a Chinese garden (Pepper 1990). China's emphatic determination to separate the advanced knowledge of Western capitalist countries from concepts that were still perceived as "decadent ideas" and a "bourgeois way of life" had overtones of the formula devised in its early modernisation efforts: "Chinese learning as the substance, Western techniques for their usefulness" (Ayers 1971). The disaggregation of Western culture into positive and negative elements was arbitrary. There was no real equilibrium between Chinese and Western learning, a basic premise of China's successful integration into the world community. Since the 1990s, China's higher education policies have aimed at both qualitative and quantitative developments, including the Programme for Education Reform and Development in China (1993), the Education Act of the People's Republic of China (1995), the 21 1 Project (initiated in 1995), the 985 Project (initiated in 1998) and the dramatic expansion starting from 1999. More recent is the quest for world-class universities, which is designated as one of China's key policy positions. It reflects the larger changes in Chinese society, as China moves to engage with the outside world and reforms its economy to adopt market principles. The desire to have internationally competitive universities provides impetus for China's best institu- tions to follow the lead of European and North American universities, from curriculum to financial practices to new governance structures, further enhancing the frame of reference in higher education policy and a fervent embrace of international norms, especially in the top layer of universities. However, as observed by Kathryn Mohrman (2005), the notion of world-class status within China seems largely imitative rather than creative. In striving for international standing, top Chinese universities compare themselves with Oxford and Yale, but they lack the centuries of history and financial resources of Western universities. The latest policy initiative is the Medium and Long-Term Education Reform and Development Plan (2010-2020) approved by the State Council in May 2010. Considering that it is China's educational blueprint for the next ten years, it is expected to demonstrate the vision and determination of the Chinese leadership. In many areas where China is facing serious challenges such as disparity and quality in education, the policy has demonstrated technical preparedness. What it lacks, like its predecessors, is a well-designed education development plan to meet the nation's future demand, made especially for a re-emerging China, a country with the world's only continuous civilisation for thousands of years. The Plan could have been much more visionary to make cultural preparation for China's future global roles, instead of remaining confined to the long-term catch-up mentality. However, it continues to demonstrate prioritised economic considerations in educational policy-making Springer</page><page sequence="16">352 R. Yang (Sigurdson 2004). Economic development is the reference point in every part of the initiative, once again leaving knotty issues of culture and values aside. Concluding comments Throughout the modern era, Western and Chinese learning have contended for hegemony. Education has always been a key aspect of reform efforts (Bastid 1988). Brian Holmes (1984) argued that the transfer of policies and practices from foreign countries would only succeed if they did not violate classical Chinese concepts of knowledge and did not threaten the power of the scholar-officials.6 Unfortunately, China's experience has shown that the transfer of Western practice conflicts with Chinese traditions. Modern universities are a foreign transplant to China. Indigenous Chinese higher education institutions shared only superficial resem- blance with medieval universities in Europe. The central purpose of China's modern higher education has been to combine Chinese and Western elements at all levels including institutional arrangements, research methodologies, educational ideals and cultural spirit, a combination that brings together aspects of the Chinese and Western philosophical heritages. This, however, has not been achieved. The emphasis has always been on usefulness (ffl), with corresponding ignorance of body (If). The development of Chinese modern universities has always been confronted with the absence of both classical and modern ideas of a university. While Chinese long-standing traditions never attempted to seek the ontological significance of knowledge, top priority has always been given, consciously and unconsciously, to practical demands. As part of the national reform agenda, China's contemporary policies retain continuity with reforms since the 19th century. Throughout this period, Chinese universities have experienced ups and downs in putting into practice the then already popular vision of retaining "Chinese learning as the essence" while systematically incorporating the new knowledge essential to build the nation (Hayhoe 2005). This explains why the best experiment was achieved by the National Southwestern Associated University, and justifies the system's best innovations during 1911-1927. Today, China's strategy remains the same. At a certain stage, such a strategy could be effective. China's universities beat India's in almost every international ranking. According to the latest Academic Ranking of World Universities conducted by the Graduate School of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2010), China has Peking University and Tsinghua University in the top 200; Fudan University, Nanjing University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, University of Science and Technology of China and Zhejiang University in the top 300, Shandong University, Sichuan University and Sun Yat-sen University in the top 400, and 12 others in the top 500. China features 22 times in the top 500, and India only twice. 6 Scholar-officials or scholar-bureaucrats were civil servants appointed by the emperor of China to perform day-to-day governance from the Sui Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty in 1912, China's last imperial dynasty. They were mostly well-educated men known as the scholar-gentry, who earned their academic degrees by passing the rigorous Imperial examinations. They were schooled in calligraphy and Confucian texts, and dominated Chinese politics at the time. Ö Springer</page><page sequence="17">Self and the other in the Confucian cultural context 353 Nevertheless, the promise is doomed to be limited. China has a considerable distance to go before its aspirations to create truly world-class universities are fulfilled. In the present great leap forward in Chinese higher education, what has often been missing is attention to cultural and institutional establishments. An internationally-recognised scholarly ethos may take longer to develop than many academic and/or political leaders in China are willing to admit. Simply buying state- of-the-art laboratory equipment or pushing for more journal articles will not guarantee the kind of intellectual atmosphere that has developed over centuries on European and American campuses. Although China's recent developments deserve to be noted, they could soon hit a glass ceiling (Altbach 2010). China's universities have been able to improve their hardware considerably, while, as is always the case in China, the software building takes much longer. In order to be truly "world-class," Chinese universities cannot afford to continue avoiding the important and dwell on the trivial. As mentioned earlier, according to Pang Pu (1986), universities as cultural institutions have three layers with materials on the surface, social system and institutions in the middle, and ideologies and values at the core. China's import of the Western university model has been centred mostly on the material level, with some touches on social institutions, while the core of the Western model, comprising academic freedom and institutional autonomy, has rarely been understood, let alone implemented. The idea that the Western university model could work well on Chinese soil has been mistakenly taken for granted. For a long time, Deng Xiaoping's aphorism "Black cat, white cat, who cares, as long as it can catch mice" has been burnt into Chinese souls. It is now high time to determine the nature of the cat because the mice to be caught would definitely be different. The Chinese experience has more general implications for comparative studies. While most people agree with Deutsch, Dominguez and Heclo (1981, p. 4) that "without comparisons, we could neither talk nor think," it is equally important to understand the prerequisites for comparative studies. One such prerequisite is a clearly defined context. Indeed, many abuses of comparative studies have been due to misuse of context. For example, in the studies of Chinese higher education, although the significance of China's societal factors is generally acknowledged, some have reached a conclusion of a swift rise of Chinese universities on a global stage, even trying to characterise it as a Chinese model; others have stressed the marketisation and corporatisation of the system, claiming that China is moving in line with the "global tides"; while still others have expressed their great concern about the sustainability of China's higher education development. A major reason for such differentiation lies in the inaccuracy and inconsistency in their definition of the Chinese context. Context is too often treated inadequately as static, consistent, all-embracing and reasonable In this regard, the prominent Chinese scholar Pang Pu's (1986) thesis of cultural structures deserves our attention as comparativists.
