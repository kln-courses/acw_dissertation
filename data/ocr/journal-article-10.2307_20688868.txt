<plain_text><page sequence="1">PREFACE Demonstrating the sometimes surprising?and, for the editors, at least, highly satisfying?way that contributions to the Women in Ger man Yearbook often resonate with one another, this volume presents an array of articles that span eight centuries and, we hope, yield notable new insights into a wide range of periods, texts, and authors. Arranged chronologically, they nonetheless fall into several distinct clusters that should also persuade readers unfamiliar with particular fields of the vitality and range of feminist scholarship in German. The first three articles reflect feminist interests in medieval and early modern literature, periods that have sometimes been under/repre sented in our endeavors. John Jeep discovers telling evidence pertain ing to the early history of friendship among women in an eleventh century convent community. Drawing on the Sankt Trudperter Hohes Lied, an anonymous twelfth-century German translation of and com mentary on the "Song of Songs," he contrasts the nature of the friend ship that emerges in a community of women with more androcentric depictions of love and friendship in medieval texts contemporaneous with the Sankt Trudperter text. By focusing on this dimension of re flective religious writing, Jeep demonstrates that its concern with wo men's issues "predates, and conceivably contributes to the later emer gence of, women authors in religious communities, the most productive of whom are the mystics." In a sixteenth-century songbook commis sioned by Ottilia Fenchlerin of Strasbourg, Albrecht Classen detects traces of women's voices and women's themes that lead him to suggest that this text may represent the first major body of secular women's poetry in the history of German literature. Classen reaches this conclu sion through a detailed analysis of exemplary pieces in the collection. Comparing them with the medieval tradition of Frauenlieder composed by male poets and Proven?al trobairitz poetry undoubtedly created by women, he argues that the surprisingly radical fashion in which wo men's issues and concerns are addressed in Fenchlerin's songbook is without precedent in the history of early German literature. Concluding this cluster, Mara Wade's study uncovers and recovers the history of published works by three seventeenth-century Saxon sisters. In her demonstration of the importance of primary bibliographical research</page><page sequence="2">Women in German Yearbook 14 for feminist scholarship of the Early Modern Period, Wade leads the reader to an understanding of the prayers, Lieder, and commentaries they published in German on the joyous and tragic events of the life cycle: birth, marriage, and death. To ignore their writings, Wade shows us, is to miss important contributions to both German Protes tantism and Lutheran court culture. The next cluster of articles focuses on literature around 1800. Drawing attention to Charlotte von Hezel, the first woman to publish a magazine for women using her own name, Melanie Archangeli points out particular journalistic innovations in Hezel's Wochenblatt f?rs sch?ne Geschlecht, including a health column directed especially to women and weekly literary reviews written by Hezel herself. Archan geli compares Hezel's journal with Sophie von La Roche's better known periodical, Pomona, to suggest that the unconventional style, literary values, and gender relations depicted in Das Wochenblatt may have represented an uncomfortable challenge to established social and literary practices and thus contributed to the lack of resonance of He zel's "alternative voice." In a provocative reexamination of Schiller's Jungfrau von Orleans, Gail Hart employs Schiller's own description of the feminine in his theoretical essay "?ber Anmut und W?rde" to explore the distinction between gender attributes (masculine and femi nine) and gender attributions (men and women) in his drama. Schiller, she argues, was aware of the contingency and transportability of the attributes that signal gender. In his attempt to create a counter-model to the medieval "sex-gender" assumptions that underlay the execution of the historical Joan of Arc, however, Hart uncovers slippages and dis sonances that mark Schiller's play as a highly experimental, but only partially successful work that failed to satisfy conventional assumptions yet did not quite succeed in countering them. Finally, in another analy sis of gender coding, Lisa Roetzel reads Bettina von Arnim's epistolary novel Die G?nderode as a rewriting of the Romantic concept of genius in feminine terms. In Roetzel's reading, the dialog between the fic tional character Bettine and her friend and mentor Karoline is a repre sentation of von Arnim's subversive notion of feminine genius, one that oscillates between creativity and artistic control. In the resultant challenge to conventional concepts of art and artistic practice, Roetzel finds a clear allusion to the political events of 1848, concluding that for von Arnim "art is a deed that at its very essence presents a challenge to act." Another group of articles centered on women writers of the earlier part of the twentieth century begins with Muriel Cormican's analysis of the vacillation between submission and self-assertion in the female</page><page sequence="3">Preface xi protagonist of Lou Andreas-Salom?'s Das Haus as a reflection of con flicting cultural impulses of the author's times: between traditional expectations of women as wives and mothers and the challenges to such role definitions posed by the turn-of-the century women's move ment. In pointing to the complicated d?mystification of patriarchy that Salom? attempts in a traditional women's geme, Cormican explains the contradictory reception of Salom?'s work by feminists who acclaimed her personal exemplification of social and sexual freedom and by those who deplored many of the views she espoused regarding women. Each of the next three articles in this cluster examines the very specific challenges posed by anti-war texts written by women in response to their experience of war in this century. Inca Rumold decodes Else Lasker-Sch?ler's Der Malik: Eine Kaisergeschichte as a pacifist roman ? clef. Written during World War I, the novel represents Lasker-Sch? ler's attempt to deal with taboo topics of the time?the military regime of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the mounting incendiary tensions between Jews and non-Jews, and differences between pro-war and anti-war writers and artists?and to address her own situation as a woman writer among the male Expressionists. In Rumold's analysis, Der Malik marks a turning point in the poet's life, her "highly conscious testimony to the failure of the Expressionist dream." Two more articles in this cluster focus on plays by Ilse Langner. Friederike Emonds investigates Lang ner's Frau Emma k?mpft im Hinterland as a play that offers a revision ist perspective on World War I from the point of women at the home front, where women confront not only the daily struggle for survival but, just as importantly, issues of their own role and identity in a changed society. In making visible forms of violence that were con sidered too trivial for the master narrative of history, Langner argues for a redefinition of Heimat and Vaterland that includes both men and women and projects a postwar utopia of social and economic gender equality. Working with one of Langner's later plays, Klyt?mnestra, Catherine Marshall analyzes the alternative society created by the mythical queen as Langner's feminist response to the rhetoric of war. In Langner's drama, Clytemnestra?traditionally demonized as a mur derer or discounted as a mother in mourning?is depicted as a queen who has used her reign in Mycene to create an alternate society that denies the primacy of patriarchy and war. That Clytemnestra is al lowed to fail, Marshall suggests, only demonstrates Langner's recog nition of the pervasiveness of the fascism and militarism that were dominating her own world after 1933. The final cluster of articles, which are all interdisciplinary and comparative, albeit in quite different ways, focuses on the works of</page><page sequence="4">xii Women in German Yearbook 14 more contemporary writers. Continuing the theme of responses to Nazi ideology, Dagmar Lorenz examines the concepts "man" and "animal," basic to the Western discourse of exclusion and discrimination, in the context of works by German and Austrian Jewish writers to whom Nazi ideology assigned a status similar to or lower than that of ani mals. Lorenz shows that these authors' opposition to anthropomorphic attitudes implies a fundamental critique of the dominant paradigm of Western culture, which establishes man's superiority both in terms of species and of gender. By drawing on recent feminist criticism and ani mal-rights theories, she brings to light parallels among traditionally separate discourses and uncovers opposing cultural norms in Jewish and Christian, feminist and patriarchal, Nazi and humanist, anthropo centric and non-speciest positions. In her examination of Christa Moog's 1988 novel, Aus tausend gr?nen Spiegeln, Hannelore M?ndt places it in the tradition of autobiographical writings by women that re sort to multiple displacements of subjectivity. Moog, who bases her novel on her own expatriation from the GDR in 1984 and her subse quent travels to many of the countries where Katherine Mansfield lived and died, tells her own story by retreating behind a first-person nar rator who, in turn, disappears behind the life and writings of Mans field. By examining the strategies by which she interlaces these lives, M?ndt shows how Moog destablilizes the dichotomy between self-rep resentation and the representation of another individual, pointing to the ambivalence inherent in the tension between the desire for self-realiza tion and independence, on the one hand, and a sense of displacement and the loss of orientation and identity, on the other. Finally, Sabine Wilke takes up the re-emergence of the cruel women in the films of Monika Treut, beginning with an allusion to Nietzsche's oft-quoted injunction not to forget the whip when one goes to woman. Pointing out that, contrary to popular readings of this as an invitation to beat the woman soundly, Nietzsche was referring to the cruel, sadistic woman who requires the whip to maltreat the male masochist, Wilke explores masochistic projections of the cruel woman in the works of the Mar quis de Sade and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch as a background to her examination of Treut. She analyzes the dialectic relationship between the construction and deconstruction of the Utopian potential inherent in Treut's cruel women as a deliberate and effective means of alienating the viewer, who is thus alerted to the problematic of what is presented. With this volume, Sara Friedrichsmeyer concludes eight years of service as coeditor of the Women in German Yearbook, years that have been devoted to the increasing professionalization and internationaliza tion of our publication. As the result of a carefully conducted national</page><page sequence="5">Preface xiii search led by past Yearbook coeditor Jeanette Clausen, Susanne Zantop of Dartmouth College was appointed to succeed Sara and has, in fact, already begun her work in this capacity. Needless to say, we are de lighted and confident that she will maintain the traditions of collegiality and competence to which past and present coeditors have been so dedi cated, as well as add some touches of her own. Unchanged is our in terest in receiving submissions of originality and high quality. We will continue to promote a variety of feminist approaches to all aspects of German literature and culture, as we hope the present volume demon strates. Finally, thanks and acknowledgment for on-going support of the Women in German Yearbook are due to our own institutions, the Uni versity of Cincinnati and the University of Rochester, and, of course, to the ever alert and judicious Victoria Hoelzer-Maddox.
