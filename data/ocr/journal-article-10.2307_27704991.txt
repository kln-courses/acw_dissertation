<plain_text><page sequence="1">Natural Science in German Romanticism. By Alexander Gode-von Aesch. New York: Columbia University Press, 1941. Pp. 302. $3.00. The New Series of Columbia University Germanic Studies has set a remarkable standard in the publication of monographs. Gode-von Aesch's Natural Science in German Romanticism, how ever, marks a new high point in the series. The author shows not only imaginative and careful scholarship, and an excellent style, but he shows also that he has spent many years of careful and intelligent reading and study on the important problem of his thesis. As Gode-von Aesch himself says (p. 4), his investigation con centrates on the movement commonly designated as Early Romanticism, but it also includes many earlier and later authors who have something to contribute to his study. It should be pointed out that he is not concerned with the traditionally and arbitrarily designated movements from 1750 on, but that he, following Korff especially, looks upon the years of transition from the eighteenth to the twentieth century as being best designated as the "Age of Goethe." Just as important as this disinclination to be fettered by academic labels is his consideration of many writers who were interested almost exclusively in philosophy or in one of the other smaller segments of natural science,?that is, writers who were almost completely disinterested in belles lettres. The "Introduction" deals with the general unity of the period; the second chapter "Science and Literature" stresses the specific interrelationship of these fields in the period under dis cussion,?a time when the unity was more nearly complete than at any other in modern history. In the third chapter "The New Lucretius" he discusses first Le Sage's essay of 1784 "The New tonion Lucretius" and then Wieland's attempt {Die Natur der Dinge) to compete with the Latin poet-philosopher. At first thought one might disapprove of the author's rather detailed attention (pp. 39-52) to Wieland's immature effort to solve a problem of such magnitude. However, Gode-von Aesch is justi fied in doing so, since he shows clearly that Wieland's work was symptomatic of the age. Regardless of Wieland's inability to reach a solution, the various aspects of his work mark clearly the problems of such an attempt based on Newtonian ideas.</page><page sequence="2">286 Hillhouse These problems, and the answers offered, are treated in the following nine chapters: "The Unity of Organic Nature," "Time and Eternity: The Problem of Evolution," "Romantic Anthropomorphism: The Biological Problem," "The Infinity of Nature," "Type and Organism," "Totality: The Psychic Prob lem of Ego and Cosmos," "Vital Force," "Man the Measure of All Things," and "Physiognomies." Throughout these chapters, Gode-von Aesch brings to bear his vast store of carefully and thoughtfully gathered knowledge, his ability to select the es sential features of his material, and his skill in organizing and presenting his ideas. It is probably unnecessary to state that his topics and the discussion of them are proportioned to their im portance during the period under discussion?not to our interests and knowledge today. Naturally, he is not concerned with show ing what fraction of our present scientific knowledge, or what "interesting" scientific theory, was then current. As a result, we feel the interrelation, and the essential unity of the various aspects of the intellectual, spiritual life of that time. In the concluding chapter "Cosmic Poetry: The Quest for a Modern Mythos," the author, in a kind of parallel with the chap ter on Wieland's effort, presents the ambitions of those in dividuals who felt this unity most deeply, and who seriously considered the writing of a universal poem. He discusses the intentions and the attempts of Chenier, H?lderlin, Goethe, Schelling, and Hardenberg. Indeed, in some cases these efforts were fragmentary only in the sense of the Romantic "Frag mente." This monograph required a vast accumulation and a thor ough assimilation of diverse materials. The author followed the only possible method,?that of treating his material from the point of view of that time, the approach of natural philosophy, rather than the divided approach?philosophy and natural science?of the twentieth century. The inevitably abstract na ture of the discussion is fortunately compensated by his com mand of language and the stimulating statements of ideas and Robert T.
