<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Magical Mirror Plaque from Yavneh-Yam Moshe Fischer Ortal-Paz Saar Tel Aviv University A broken circular pottery plaque (fig. 1) was retrieved during the Yavneh-Yam excavations (reg. no. YY95-512I-5045-#26).1 It is a fragment of a 'magical mirror plaque', examples of which are known from various sites in Israel, all dating from the Byzantine period. Several such plaques have been published in the past in IEJ (Rahmani 1964). Only half of the plaque (original diameter: 7 cm.) has survived. It is rather thin, with a depression surrounded by a ridge in its centre. Traces of plaster, which held the mirror in place, were preserved in the depression. The plaque is decorated with Fig. 1. Mirror plaque from Yavneh-Yam l Yavneh-Yam is located on the Mediterranean coast, between Jaffa and Ashdod. During the six seasons of excavations conducted to date (1992-2005), settlement remains uncovered range from the Bronze Age to the Middle Ages (the second millen nium BCE to the twelfth century CE). For initial summaries, see Fischer 2002; 2003; 2005. The drawing is by Rodica Pinchas, and the photograph by Pavel Shrago (Insti tute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University).

Since the item is broken at its central axis, there is no sign of a suspension hole, yet such a hole can be reconstructed from similar, fully preserved, mirror plaques. The plaque was uncovered in the debris of the eastern part of a Byzantine bath complex, which was probably dismantled during the Early Islamic period. Late Byzantine and Early Islamic oil lamps retrieved together with the item, coupled with a coin of Tiberius II (574-582 CE) found in the adjacent locus 512II, helped to date the complex. The pottery plaque uncovered at Yavneh-Yam has several parallels in Byzantine Palestine. Circular plaques decorated with chevrons have been retrieved at Gezer, Beit Hini (Bethany), Nessana and Zikhrin. Abrief summary of these parallels and their previous interpretations may be constructive. During his excavations of Gezer, Macalister encountered what he described as 'a pottery pyx, for reception of a crumb of Eucharistie bread' (Macalister 1911: 387). This was, in fact, a pottery plaque (diameter: 9.1 cm.), with a relief decora tion of chevrons, united by a thin line. The band of chevrons surrounds a circular depression in the centre of the plaque. In the depression, fixed with plaster, lies a round piece of glass (diameter: 2.5 cm.). The object, found intact, has a small hole intended for suspension. It was discovered inside tomb 242, south-east of the ci ty, together with two small metal crosses. A similar object was discovered at Beit Hini (Bethany), a village c. 3 km. east of Jerusalem (Sailer 1957: 323; pi. 130b-4). Although only a fragment of the ceramic plaque survived, its original size and decoration can be inferred. The Beit Hini mirror plaque (diameter: 10 cm.) bore a circular band of raised chevrons, evenly spaced, surrounding a depression at its centre. Although no glass was found in the depression, the excavator mentions 'two shallow rectangular holes which suggest that at one time they used to hold some object in place' (Sailer 1957: 323). Inferring from other parallels, it can be presumed that this object was a small circular mirror. The pottery disc was discovered in a cave with a Byzantine and Early Arabic context. Sailer makes do with a brief summary of previous inter pretations, and does not interpret the function of the pottery plaque. Another pottery disc (diameter: 9 cm.) with a chevron decoration in relief was uncovered during the excavations of Nessana (Auja el-Hafir) (Dunscombe Colt 1962: 60-61, pl. XXVI-9). The mirror fixed at its centre (diameter: 2.5 cm.) is surrounded by a groove followed by a thin line. The decoration consists of an outer band of raised chevrons, in groups of three. There is an inner band of small painted dots. A suspension hole survives at the top. The object was found almost intact; no indication is given as to its original location or context. Rahmani (1964: 54-60) published a similar mirror plaque that originated in a tomb from Zikhrin. The plaque (diameter: 9.36 cm.) has a circular depression (diameter: 2.4 cm.) at its centre, and is decorated with a band of chevrons in groups of three and an inner band with painted red, dark blue and yellow dots.</page><page sequence="3">MAGICAL MIRROR PLAQUE FROM YAVNEH-YAM 85 The above list covers the mirror plaques that resemble the Yavneh-Yam frag ment. There are several additional objects of this kind, featuring different decoration or made of a different material. More than 25 mirror plaques are known to the authors ? some made of stone and others of clay, featuring architec tural motifs, anthropomorphic or zoomorphic decorations, or a different geometrical decoration (e.g., concentric circles, radial lines, or tiny incised circles) (Saar 2003: 79-86). Several interpretations have been proposed for the function of these objects, including eucharistie pyxes (Cr? 1894; Macalister 1911: 387), bread stamps (Iliffe 1934), children's toys (Rozenvalle 1921), and religious/symbolic items (Rozenvalle 1921; Mayer and Reifenberg 1937; Goodenough 1953: 174-177; see also Avi-Yonah 1944: 134, although he refrains from a decisive interpretation). A proposal that accounts for all characteristics of the various mirror plaques was first raised by Rahmani (1964), and has since been reiterated by Israeli (1974) and Iron Lubin (1993).2 Rahmani suggested that the mirrors had an apotropaic role: to deflect the evil eye from the owner of the plaques back upon its source, thus protecting the intended victim (Rahmani 1964: 59-60). The concept of the evil eye is strongly associated with envy (Saar 2003: 26-27). 'Giving the evil eye' is not necessarily a voluntary or deliberate process, and almost anyone can be guilty of it (including animals, especially praying mantises and snakes). Over the ages, therefore, numerous means of protection were devised against the noxious effects of the evil eye, such as the tiny mirrors embedded in pottery or stone plaques. The context in which the Yavneh-Yam plaque was found supports this inter pretation. It was uncovered in the debris of a bath complex dating from the Byzantine period. Apparently, baths were considered fertile ground for envy, which could strike with violence, because of the elegance of the premises and/or because of the beautiful naked bodies parading therein (Dunbabin 1989: 33-46, who presents a wide range of apotropaic motifs and inscriptions displayed on bath-house mosaics). The Yavneh-Yam mirror plaque could be another example of an apotropaic object, intended to reflect the evil eye back on its envious source.
