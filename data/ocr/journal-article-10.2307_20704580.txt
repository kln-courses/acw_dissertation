<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORTER COMMUNICATIONS THE VHIth INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL AND ETHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES, TOKYO AND KYOTO, SEPTEMBER 1968 Eugene Giles Harvard University and Richard Pearson University of Hawaii PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY^) As is common at the quadrennial CISE, a large proportion of the Tokyo papers?nearly one half?were devoted to physical anthropology, or as it is called at these gatherings, Anthropology (in contrast to Ethnology). The first Asian siting of the Congress produced the expected flurry of papers concerned with the Far East and South East Asia, and even Western Asia (Japanese researchers have excavated Neanderthal material in Israel, and a symposium was built around fossil man in Asia). There was very little carry-over to the Pacific and Australia, however; only a tiny number of papers were primarily devoted to the biological aspects of Man in the South Pacific. One paper, by P. A. Radwanski, claimed a re-examination of Easter Island crania in Belgium suggested a Maori-like overlay of an earlier population common to Oceania and America. Another paper investigated somatotypes in New Guinea, but outside of these most mention of South Pacific peoples arose as a part of two excellent symposia. One of these symposia, "Selection and Differential Fertility in Human Populations", demonstrated again that genetic and evolutionary studies of noncosmopolitan peoples must go further than mere blood group surveys of small and ill-defined populations. J. V. Neel's report on the truly multi disciplinary project he directs among the hunting and gathering Ge-speakers of Brazil foreshadows the wave of the future in human biology?if both 1.

Roberts' examination of the inhabitants of the island of Tristan da Cunha illustrated the use to which vital statistics, in this case going back to 1816, can be put in ascribing population changes to differential fertility or other mechanisms when the evidence is complete, particularly as to in- and out-migration. J. N. Spuhler attempted to calculate, as he has before, an index of the opportunity for natural selection in a number of peoples, including populations from New Guinea, Queensland, New Hebrides and Tikopia. The index partitions "total" selection intensity into that attributable to differential mortality and to differential fertility. The results show remarkable variation in a worldwide sample, with, among the groups mentioned above, the Queens land and New Guinea populations evincing selective consequences of differential fertility notably greater than of differential mortality. Spuhler pointed out the difficulties incurred by the deaths of females during the reproductive period and confounding out-migration with mortality in the available statistics. While the depth of documentary evidence for a Tristan simply does not exist for a Tikopia, Spuhler's paper shows one way in which the sort of data?completed family size, number of births per parent, migration?either available in the notes of social anthropologists or accessible in their field work, can be of real use in establishing biological parameters of rapidly disappearing ways of life. The material in the other symposium, "Biochemical Polymorphisms in Man and Other Primates and Their Anthropological Implications", defies summary because of the wealth of material emerging in this particularly active branch of human biology. A. G. Motulsky reviewed the multitude of genetically deter mined protein variants detectable in the components of human blood. The majority of these traits, even though occasionally found in groups which anthropologists traditionally deem "theirs", are nevertheless so rare that their occurrence may be explained by recurrent mutation. Of more anthropological interest are traits with the variants existing at respectable frequencies in a population (the Rubicon is often taken as 1 %). These are most likely brought about by natural selection, past and/or present. A few of the haemoglobin types no doubt offer protection in a malarial environment; the selective function of the other protein variants is uncertain. R. L. Kirk examined schemes to utilise these genetic traits as markers in human evolution and migration. While Australasian populations have been relatively well-tested for many of these genetic characters, the results have not always been unequivocal. A serum protein, transferrin, an example discussed by Kirk, comes in some 17 genetically determined variants. One of these, called D i, is found (so far) only in Australian Aborigines and Melanesians on the one hand and Africans and American Negroes on the other. Although the variants themselves have been discovered only in the last decade, it has been possible in the past year to demonstrate that transferrin D i in both areas is the result of the smallest possible difference, a substitution of the same single amino acid in the ordinary transferrin molecule. Does this imply an ancient connection between the two peoples, or two identical mutations that were advantageous in their widely separated environments? The 'degeneracy' of the genetic code even allows the possibility that there is an ultimate genetic difference between the two populations even though the pro ducts of the genes are the same. The preponderance of the genetic evidence, however, does not support close ties between the two regions. W. W. Howells buttressed this position in a paper taking a sophisticated statistical second-look at Melanesian and African crania: he found them unrelated. Utilising new techniques and new data to sort out old problems is likely to occupy physical anthropologists for some time. 432</page><page sequence="3">EUGENE GILES AND RICHARD PEARSON CULTURE HISTORY^ North-American-Eurasian Relationships, Japanese Ethnogenesis, and Megali thic Cultures were the topics covered in the three symposia relating to archaeology and culture history. The first, organised by C. Chard, generated considerable comment and valuable interchange. Problems of translation and scheduling were admirably regulated. J. Wright presented data on the Laurel Tradition of northeastern Canada, and suggested that it was derived from the north, rather than from a more southerly center possibly related to Point Peninsula cultures. N. Dikov pointed out in the discussion, however, that there were no close analogies with the Kamchatka area proposed as a source of the Laurel Tradition by Wright, but that check-stamping, a means of pottery decoration mentioned by Wright, was present in the lower Lena and Selenga area in the first millennium B.C. J. Griffin, who had earlier hypothesised extensive connections between north east Asian pottery and that of America, stated in his paper that the only firm affiliation to be seen at present is between Chukchi ceramics dating after 1000 B.C. and the Norton ceramics of Alaska. C. Borden presented a compre hensive picture of traditions in southwestern British Columbia. The first, which has many choppers, possibly derived from Asia, the Pasika Complex, dates to the Two Creeks Interstadial. The second, the Milliken Phase, occurring between 7100 B.C. and 6200 B.C., appears to be a northern extension of the Palaeo Western Tradition. The third, the Microblade Tradition, was derived from the Old World shortly before the end of the Pleistocene. Borden suggested that the Palaeo-Western Tradition must have reached the New World earlier than 21000 B.C., while Beringia was exposed, and that the Old World Mousteroid foliate point as seen at Ust Kfianskaya must be the progenitor of the New World Big Game Hunter points. H. Larsen discussed the Trail Creek Site, British Columbia, which has bones of extinct bison and horse dated at 11000 B.C., and mierolithic artifacts dated at about 7000 B.C. He also outlined the origins of Eskimo cultures in the Western Arctic. W. Irving dealt with the Arctic Small Tool Tradition, of which the Denbigh Flint Complex is the best known component, and derived it from Asia. W. Hurley discussed North American and Japanese terminology for cord-marking on ceramics, and attempted to rationalise the differences of the two schemes. H. Collins discussed the origins of the Arctic Small Tool Tradition, possible derivation of the Anangula burin type from Hokkaido, and the later derivation of the Okhotsk Culture. C. Serizawa gave a very comprehensive review of the Japanese Palaeolithic based on data from 500 sites, many of which are stratified. It was thought recently that Japan was first populated about 25,000 years ago, but this date is now pushed far back, perhaps as far as the Middle Pleistocene; choppers have been found which are typologically more primitive than the Mousterian remains at sites such as Ust Khanskaya. In 1968, at Kumara, on the Upper Amur River, were found Mousterian artifacts, similar to those of Central Asia, showing the proximity of Mousterian assemb lages on the Asian mainland to Japan. Serizawa outlined the major complexes of the Japanese Palaeolithic showing that on sites such as Fukui and Iwashita in Kyushu, ceramic cultures develop from the Palaeolithic without major breaks. A. Okladnikov outlined Neolithic cultures in the lower Amur River with a revision of the pottery sequence, which, in a manner rather similar to the Japanese sequence, goes from recently found stamped pottery to Kamegaoka 2.

Dikov reported the discovery from Ushki Lake, Kamchatka, of two complexes, one dating to about 14000 B.P., the other to 10000 B.P. These Upper Palaeolithic remains are related to materials from Japan and the New World. House remains from the second complex were new finds. S. Aroutiunov presented a typology of harpoon heads from the Northern Pacific. A second symposium, on Japanese Ethnogenesis, reviewed the problem in some of its facets. J. Kidder opened the session with a brief summary of Japanese archaeology, then proceeded to new material on jar burials on open Jomon sites, particularly of the Middle Period. Pottery vessels buried in abandoned houses or along their south side have yielded high quantities of phosphorus, although the bones are completely decomposed. Kidder suggested that the abandoning of houses after a death is similar to the removal from palaces after a death of the emperor in the early historic period of Japan. S. Murayama suggested that Japanese is a 'hybrid language' of Altaic and Malayo-Polynesian origin on the basis of the presence of certain kinds of prefixation, suffixation, and strategic cognates. Support for southern connections was also provided in a paper by T. Obayashi on Japanese mythology, taken from the earliest documents, the Kojiki (712 A.D.) and the Nihonshoki (720 A.D.). Motifs with parallels in South China, Southeast Asia, and Polynesia arrived in Japan from South China possibly with Yayoi elements. These seem to balance the Korean and Siberian motifs, including the myth of the origin of the Imperial family, which must have arrived in Japan from Korea in the Kofun period. A third paper, presented by M. Inoue, covered the old problems regard ing the origin and location of Yamataikoku, the first Japanese state, and the theory of the Horse People?that the first Japanese state developed directly as the result of a migration of horse nomads from Korea?of N. Egami, who commented at length. My own feeling at the end of this symposium was that historical studies of this period have reached a point of diminishing returns, and that the archaeology is not interpretively sophisticated enough to make any headway, particularly with the current emphasis on treasure from tombs. A focussed, comparative plan of excavation between Japan and Korea should be undertaken. "Megalithic Cultures" was the third symposium. The opening paper by E. Haberland presented a rather sober review of the considerations behind "Megalithic" Studies, emphasising the importance of proving carefully historical relationships and evaluating evidence of the various functions of the artifacts being compared. T. Obayashi outlined aspects of Miao-Yao ethnography relating to large stones on the basis of written sources, while H. Loofs described Ifugao stone remains, debating whether or not they might meet Heine-Geldern's definition of a "classic megalithic culture." A final paper, most satisfying because of its careful description, good illustrations, and avoidance of megalithic "theory" was presented by E. Kaneko on the Tombs of Hisamatsu, Miyako Island, in the Ryukyus, probably the only salvage and reconstruction in the Ryukyus outside of the main island group of Okinawa. Contributed papers, some 30 in all, covered a range of topics, including the Pacific and Southeast Asia, East Asia, Europe, America, and general problems or archaeological techniques. In the section on the Pacific and Southeast Asia, R. Shutler outlined a chronology for the New Hebrides based on 49 radiocarbon dates, stating that pigs arrived in the New Hebrides before 850 A.D. From materials from Tongoa Island going back to 903 B.C., he concluded that the occupation of these islands started 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. Y. Sinoto presented a comprehensive 434</page><page sequence="5">EUGENE GILES AND RICHARD PEARSON review of fishhook typologies for Oceania, stressing the significance of these typologies for cultural sequence. R. Fox reviewed the Palaeolithic of the Philippines, particularly remains from Tabon Cave, Palawan. The flake in dustries are all from one tradition?flakes from unprepared cores?without blades, the general tendency being for flakes to become smaller over time. Assemblage V, the oldest, has been dated at approximately 50,000 years ago, although not through direct absolute dating. Assemblage III, an intermediate one, dates from about 22,000 years ago from radiocarbon, while the final lithic phase, Phase I, was predominant about 9,000 years ago. The flake tools are very similar to those from Sangiran, Indonesia, and other sites to the south. There has thus far been no fossil evidence for a distinct break at the end of the Pleistocene for the Philippines. Pottery first appears about 1500 B.C., while iron dates to about 190 B.C. It seems that the iron was accompanied by other metals from the beginning. In European archaeology, L. Pericot-Garcia presented a review of the archaeology of the Iberian peninsula, while two papers were contributed on Middle Neolithic remains from Vadastia, Rumania. G. Moraru-Popa pre sented a paper on the archaeology of the Rumanian plow, C. Plopsor and D. N. Plopsor the evidence for human occupations during the Rumanian Villafranchian. B. Boroneantu and D. Plopsor introduced new data from the Schela Cladovei Site, which spans the Late Palaeolithic and the Early Neolithic in Rumania. A. Stensberg presented the results of 18 years of detailed survey of 50 hectares of mediaeval fields in Denmark dated to c. 1000 A.D. to 1200 A.D., an imposing contribution to the study of ancient agriculture. One paper devoted to African prehistory, an assessment and note of caution regarding statements of tremendous antiquity for finds from the most westerly parts of Africa, was read by C. Descamps. The session on the Far East was opened by T. Akazawa and H. Watanabe, with a paper entitled "Fishing Ecology and Prehistoric Shellmound Settle ments." The work of the authors has been directed toward detailed investigations of the habits of the striped mullin, red sea bream and black sea bream; they found that Jomon fishermen did not catch fish younger than about 4 years and that they were caught only in the summer when they were close to the shore. S. Yamanouchi's paper "The Arrowshaft Smoother in World Prehistory and its Bearing on the Chronology of Jomon Pottery" read in summary by J. Kidder, drew comment. The author's thesis was that the smoothers appear in the earliest Jomon sites, yet are known from areas outside of Japan from only as early as 2500 B.C.; therefore, Jomon culture cannot be as early as the radiocarbon dates indicate. G. Clark pointed out that in Europe arrow smoothers are known from the 9th millennium B.C. from sites in Schleswig Holstein, while J. Griffin pointed out that they are not always used for the production of arrow shafts, but may have been used to produce dart shafts which could be very early. A third paper, presented by F. Ikawa, constituted an extremely clear and heuristic presentation of Japanese Palaeolithic industries and their place in connections between Northern Eurasia and the New World. Miss Ikawa emphasised that the Japanese Islands did not constitute a direct link or route, but rather, that some of the complexes that are becoming well known were typical of the wide-spread industries which span both sides of Beringia. R. Pearson and H. J. Im presented the results of a survey of Cheju Island, Korea, attempting to link their finds to the Tongsamdong finds of L. Sample. A separate section on the Ainu attracted the attention of ethnologists and archaeologists alike. S. Murayama discussed the extent of Ainu territory from the ethnohistoric sources, concluding that they extended as far north as southern 435</page><page sequence="6">THE Vlllth INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS Kamchatka in the 18th century. C. Schuster discussed the significance of an item of Ainu material culture, the shaved wooden stick known as the &lt;linao", suggesting that originally it was an anthropomorphic family tree. T. Inukai described the Ainu salmon ceremony. C. Chard reviewed the problem of the Ainu, stating that their homeland is northeastern Hokkaido, where they have been for the last 7,000 years, expanding into Sakhalin and the Kuriles possibly after 1500 A.D., when the Okhotsk culture moved out of the area. Northeastern Hokkaido, from the archaeological record, has been consistently distinctive. Place names in Honshu show that the Ainu, including probably the Yeso, occupied large parts of the north, although Ainoid skeletons do not occur in archaeological sites south of Aomori, Honshu. No basis can be found from present anthropological data to support the hypotheses of close relationships with European Caucasoid or Australoid populations. A key problem centers around Ainu language which seems to have been subjected to heavy influences from Japanese, as one would expect from studies of other refuge groups such as the Negritoes or Veddhas. S. Aroutiunov's exposition of the Soviet view that the Ainu are from Southeast Asia provided an interesting basis for dis cussions. E. Hamp contributed a detailed discussion of the principles involved in seeking Indo-European and Ainu relationships, while D. Dumond discussed the relationships of Eskimo and Aleut finds to the problem of Asian origins of these groups. D. Anderson outlined the Palaeo-Arctic tradition of Alaska. Papers concerning American archaeology focussed primarily on very early materials relevant to comparisons with the Old World?megafaunal extinctions and survivals by W. Edwards, early lithic cultures by D. Dragoo, early human fossils from the mid-Pinedale by H. Wormington, prehistory of Healy Lake, Alaska, by R. McKennan and J. Cook, Palaeo-Indian and later lithic industries from the Caribbean, by J. Cruxent and L. Chanlatte, and the pre-ceramic of the Northwest Argentine by E. Agliano. Other papers included a description of a figurine from Eastern Mexico by F. Dockstadter, a comparison of radio carbon and obsidian hydration dating as applied to ceremonial architecture at Temesco, Mexico, by K. Dixon, a review of Taino prehistory by L. Estevez Weber, and an overview of the conceptual inventory of American archaeology by D. Schwartz. R. Bullen discussed the discovery of underwater sites in Florida dating to about 800 B.C., and the effects that a rise in sea level might have for Southeastern American prehistory. Two technical papers were of particular interest. E. Harp discussed optimum scales and emulsions for aerial photography in archaeology, concluding on the basis of his Eastern Hudson Bay research that Panchromatic coverage at 1:15000 yielded the greatest amount of effective information. M. Suzuki and H. Watanabe reported recent advances in fission track dating, which is useful in determining the age of alteration or production of glassy substances by heat. Their assumption is "that the number of fission tracks in a mineral is pro portional to the lapse of time after the mineral was last heated above the critical temperature and the total number of U238 atoms contained in the mineral, the latter being determined from the number of fission tracks of U235 atoms which are artificially induced by attacking the mineral with thermal neutrons." The method appears thus far to be most appropriate for glazes and obsidian fragments from hearths or embedded in ceramics. Many of the papers offered in the Physical Anthropology sessions of the meetings were of interest to archaeologists. The first of the Symposia, dealing with Pleistocene man in Asia, emphasised the southwest and northern portions of the continent. Two of the papers dealt with a Neanderthal find from Amud, Palestine; T. Ogawa and H. Hosokawa discussed the endocranial cast of the 436</page><page sequence="7">EUGENE GILES AND RICHARD PEARSON specimen, while H. Suzuki compared Amud with Shanidar I. W. Howells discussed the morphological relationships of Mt Carmel man, concluding that the Skuhl finds are "virtually sapiens in character, perhaps as a somewhat primitive variant, perhaps as a sapiens population affected slightly by Neander thal genes, but essentially neither a full 'hybrid' nor a form transitional from Neanderthal to modern man." T. Stewart's paper, "The Evolution of Man in Asia as Seen from the Lower Jaw," contained a proposal of an East-West difference in jaw form among the Pithecanthropines and the hypothesis that the Neanderthals are more closely related to the Western Pithecanthropines, although problems still remain unsolved. V. Yakimov presented new material on Mousterian sites in the USSR which have yielded fossil man, and discussed the relationships of Neanderthals to sapiens forms. A somewhat similar, if more elaborate discussion on the behavioral adaptability of Neanderthals and H sapiens to Arctic conditions, and the relative adaptability of Mousterian and Upper Palaeolithic assemblages, was given by H. Watanabe. One group of the contributed papers dealt with the applications of multi variate analysis. W. Howell's paper concerned the analysis of crania from 17 major world-wide groups, while that of E. Giles was concerned with sexing skeletons. A paper by R. and R. Guttman and K. Rosenzweig concentrated on the analysis of perceptual and dental traits among Israeli groups, while one by M. Sutter and P. Moeschler concentrated on Neolithic crania from Western Europe. Also working on an archarological population, W. Eberhard found that the application of multi-variate analysis revealed statistically significant similarities between skulls from a Bronze and Early Iron Age cemetery in the foothills of the Hindu Kush of the "Gandhara Grave Complex" and Late Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age cranial series from Central Asia, North Iran, and Eastern Europe. I. Schwidetzky outlined the discovery of two racial com plexes in Neolithic European populations, a southern one which eventually expanded north and east, and a northern one which was absorbed. The expansion of the southern group concurs with the pattern of development of the Neolithic T. Ogata reported that human physical changes in the Jomon period corres ponded to climatic and geologic considerations. C. Y. Lin contributed a paper on the cranial capacity of skulls from Anyang now in the collections of Academia Sinica in Taiwan. G. von Koenigswald reviewed the evidence of Indonesian fossil hominids from the Djetis Beds, Javanese Villafranchian fossils, and the evidence for relating Meganthropus, one of the fossil forms, to the Austral opithecines. European palaeo-osteology ranging from early fossils to the historic period was covered in a group of papers. Skeletons from the Schela Cladovei site, Rumania, were described by D. Plopsor and B. Boroneant. Skeletal fragments from Mousterian sites in the Basque area were discussed by J. Basabe, while a comparison of the Heidleberg jaw with new Homo erectus finds was made by G. Heberer. Problems relating to the endocranial reconstruction of Atlan thropus mauritanicus were discussed by V. Kochetkova. A. Czarnetzki read the results of a study on German Gallery Graves in which he found that despite considerable cultural diversity, similarities with other groups removed from the Gallery Grave Complex were rather close. A paper by D. Jean summarised general problems regarding the palaeo-pathology of the skull, while L. Vyhnanek and M. Stloukal discussed the palaeo-pathology of Old Slavonic populations from the Moravian Empire. J. Palsson disclosed the strong possibility that some of the population of Iceland appears to be derived from Ireland and Scotland. Two papers were devoted to the effects of cremation on the identification of 437</page><page sequence="8">THE VHIth INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS human bones. One, by M. Dlokadol, was a controlled experiment on the aging and sexing of cremated bones from the crematorium of Brno, Czecho slovakia, while a second, a study by M. Stloukal dealt with the research on Bronze Age graves from north Moravia and the problems of identification created by cremation. A somewhat related paper, by I. Kiszely and P. David, proposed a new method of dating bone materials by derivatographic analysis of the organic constituents of the bone material, particularly their thermore sistant fractions between 105C? and 580C?, in conjunction with soil ratings from the immediate environs of the buried bones. Blood group identification of ancient human bones was brought up to date by S. Borgognini, while Y. Imai made some observations on electron micro scopic studies of human bones from various time levels in Japan. Superbly hosted and organised, the meetings may be counted as a success on all fronts. The publication of the papers in the Proceedings of the VHIth International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences is under way. 438</page></plain_text>
