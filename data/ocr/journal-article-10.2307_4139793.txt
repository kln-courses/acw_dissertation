<plain_text><page sequence="1">To Become a God: Cosmology, Sacrifice, and Self-Divinization in Early China. By Michael J. Puett. Harvard University Press, 2002. 358 pages. $49.50. The title of this book immediately provokes concern; some readers may immediately be reminded of the words ascribed to the dying Roman Emperor Vespasian "Vae puto, deus fio." Others may ponder on the term "God," and may recall that there are a number of Chinese terms (di, shen, gui, ling) that are variously translated as "god," "gods," "spirits," "ghosts," or rendered as "numi- nous"; and they may well look for some definitions and distinctions in a book that concerns so many aspects of religious practice. Discrimination is difficult and may be hazardous, but it is necessary; and it requires a philological approach. The author's main attempt is to provide a major context for Chinese views of human and superhuman beings and their relations, as revealed in practice and literature. The overriding question that recurs is that of whether the uni- verse was regarded as dualist, with a distinction between the two types of being, or monist, with an inbuilt continuity between them. There follows the question of the means whereby human beings can attain superior powers or qualities that may lead to their control of the spirits or of the cosmos and its operation; such gifts may result from a self-cultivation that can lead to the powers of a "spirit," "sage," or "adept." The enquiry brings to the fore the purpose of sacrifice, the role of the shaman and attempts to relate to an entity known as "The Great One" (Tai yi). Different views are cited regarding the question of whether a major reli- gious divide separated the Shang (twelfth century to 1045 B.C.E.) and Western Zhou (1045-771 B.C.E.) periods and the ways in which "correlative thinking" developed. In considering these major themes, the author draws on his wide reading of secondary studies. He calls on distinguished anthropologists and historians of religion, such as Granet and Levi-Strauss, and he looks for comparison and con- trast in other cultures that range from the Greece of Hesiod to Fiji. He reaches back to the mantic inscriptions of China's bronze age and forward to the views propounded by writers such as Dong Zhongshu (c. 179 to c. 104 B.C.E.), Liu Xiang (79-78 B.C.E.) and Gu Yong (died 9 B.C.E.). He takes in citations from a wide range of literature including some of the texts that have been found only recently. Some of these are of prime importance, dating as they do from that cru- cial time of the Warring States (fifth to third century B.C.E.); this was a formative</page><page sequence="2">1250 Journal of the American Academy of Religion period for the development of China's intellectual growth and religious activi- ties. Certain extra advantages may attach to records of the type just named; they have not been affected by a need to conform with the impositions of a recog- nized political authority. The approach to, treatment, and analysis of these writings, whether known for centuries or newly discovered, raises a basic question of which Puett is fully aware (see 24, 60), that of taking concepts and statements out of context and building a systematic scheme of thought on such a basis. Probably, given the nature of the material at our disposal, the difficulties of so doing are in some cases insuperable, despite the author's attempts to overcome them. Scholars have long recognized the fallacy of treating texts, such as the Zhuangzi, Guanzi, Li shi chun qiu, or Huiainanzi as units, rather than as anthologies. Recent finds have enhanced the problem of ascribing particular ideas to identified writers or thinkers and remind us that we possess no more than a fraction of what pro- bably existed in writing. We cannot judge how far texts were in circulation in these early centuries; and the question has arisen of whether some of those found recently in tombs were written by and for philosophers or in response to a popular demand. Treatment of the evidence is thus far from straightforward. Puett makes a brave effort to discern a systematic whole from a variety of parts, but readers deserve warning of the danger of looking at select quotations that do not neces- sarily follow the order as seen in the books from which they are cited and whose connections with each other may be open to doubt. At times one is left with the question of whether the author is choosing material to support a theory or mak- ing a thorough attempt to interpret his sources in the light of their background. While the book is concerned with the acquisition of "divine" or superhuman powers and not that of immortality, it may not be as certain as it appears to be that these two intentions should be separated rigidly. Readers may need a reminder that the key term hua (transformation) is sometimes applied to a change from one living form (human) to another (animal). In addition, a distinc- tion between a search for divinity or immortality may not be so clearly cut in the evidence of art and archaeology, which is conspicuous by its absence from men- tion here. Such items include a painting of the Warring States period of a man riding on a dragon to eternity, the well-known banner of the Countess of Da tak- ing her place in the everlasting realm of sun and moon, and the ascent of a postu- lant to an upper land, as in a fresco from Yingchengzi. There is likewise no reference to anthropomorphic representations of Tai yi, "The Great One," or indeed to the possibility that the term may represent a constellation. The book is deeply concerned with cosmology, but it does not consider the juxtaposition on certain items of the denizens of an upper world with the icons of two cosmological schemes, together with an explicit inscription of their significance. Burial practice and the provision of sacrificial vessels in tombs might add value to the book. While the main thrust of the argument concerns the acquisition of the pow- ers of a spirit, sage, or adept as seen in the texts, there are occasions when a closer and more rigorous examination of those texts and their terms is necessary and without which the argument may be flawed. Attention is also necessary to the</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 1251 remarks of the traditional commentators, often ignored here. Thus, part of a passage from the Guanzi is rendered "tones precede words," and this is taken up with the interpretation as "resonance that exists in musical tones" (112); in all probability yin, translated as "tones" is a textual error for yi "intention," "signi- ficance," or "ideas." Shen ming is rendered as "the spirits and the illuminated" (161; see also 172), regardless of the use of ming to signify "sacred" and possibly its double entendre. A sentence from the Lii shi chun qiu reads "In the current generation, the rulers use crackmaking [i.e., divination with turtles' shells] and milfoil divination ... " (173), and the citation is used to demonstrate the degree of criticism levelled against the rulers of Qin; however, shang is probably not to be taken to mean "the rulers," but as "there is respect for" and will not support Puett's argument. Dong Zhongshu was not a minister at court, as stated (287), thereby implying that he was a man of influence in public life and government; he never rose to a position at the center that was higher than Counsellor of the Palace. Historians will find difficulty in comprehending a description of Shun's sacrificial system as being based on a "feudal political arrangement" (301). Translation of text as "Heaven's eyes" rather than as "Heaven day by day ... " is disquieting, being based on a hasty misreading of a character (310). The term xing is rendered throughout as "form," without warning the reader that in many contexts it denotes a material form, that is, a human body. Puett enunciates subtle arguments and reveals some fine distinctions that have been overlooked, but the texts and their extracts do not necessarily warrant the certainty with which his somewhat general conclusions are expressed, and he may be prone to assert these on the basis of hints rather than certainties. The book is replete with terms such as "divinization practice," "ascension literature," "self-divinization," but the time is in no way ripe for incorporation of these in discussion and analysis of Chinese thought and religious practice. Possibly the book is incorrectly addressed as it passes over too many technical matters to sat- isfy specialist readers but includes peculiarities of Chinese expression whose assumptions are not fully comprehensible by non-specialists; it may even run the risk of being misleading. A glossary of Chinese terms and characters would ease the path of the student reader. doi: 10. 1093/jaarel/lfi 142 Michael Loewe Faculty of Oriental Studies, Cambridge</page></plain_text>
