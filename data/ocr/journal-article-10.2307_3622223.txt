<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME ASPECTS OF YEHUDAH HALEVI'S MYSTICISM ISRAEL EFROS There was a vein of mysticism running through all of medieval Arabic philosophy. Even the great Aristotelians, Alfarabi and Avicenna, devoted much thought to the nature and conditions of prophecy.' But this gift, they believed, resulted from a union with a supernal being of pure reason, and the way to union lay through reason. It is the philosopher in whom, according to the summary of that viewpoint given at the beginning of the Kuzari, hereditary and environmental factors developed intellectual, moral, and practical capacities which, when perfected through instruction and training, cause a divine light to dwell with him so that he and the Active Intellect become one.2 Indeed reason was not only a condition but also, in itself, a reliable source of physical and metaphysical knowledge, even though slow, gradual, syllogistic, as compared with prophecy which gives truth in a timeless flash.3 It is this rationalism, both as metaphysics and epistemology, to which Halevi is opposed. 1 See M.

Like Alfarabi and Avi- cenna, he calls it the Holy Spirit or Ruah ha-Qodesh.4 Like Alfarabi and Avicenna, he gives it sublunary place and rank, whereas Algazali regards it as the regent of the moon, and Alexander of Aphrodisia as identical with God.5 However, there is a neo-Platonic view, found in Bahya's Kitab Ma'dni al-Nafs, which identifies it with the first emanation also called Name, Hokmah, p. 55, is a better rendering than -noi for the Ar. oDRn~.

But in the face of Halevi's other utterances, the word allah should be taken here technically as a name for a species of angels. Thus in V. 21 Halevi states: "And they called those Intelligences allah and secondary causes7 as well as other names; and the last of their rank and nearest to us is the Active Intellect.8 Maimonides also in his Yesodei ha-Torah, II 7, places the Active Intellect or m'v'K at the end of a hierarchy of angels the last four grades of which he designates as elohim, bnei elohim, cherubim and 'ishim. On the other hand, Halevi's presentation of the function of the Active Intellect seems to agree with that of Avicenna and Algazali, that the influences of the Active Intellect extends to all sublunar things including minerals, as against Alfarabi, fol- lowed by Averroes, who limits it to man, that is, to the transla- tion of human thought from potentiality to actuality.9 There is 6 Kitdb Ma'dni al-Nafs ed. by I.

This view too as held by some thinkers is mentioned by Halevi.10 But Halevi opposes the entire emanation system of which the Active Intellect is a part. "People accepted it and were beguiled by it to such an extent that they thought it conclusive because they ascribed it to Greek philosophers. But it is only an asser- tion, carrying no conviction, and is open to various objections."'

Shem Tob 1. c. and also on II 12 maintains that this view was held by Maimonides. See also Moscato on Kuzari (Wilna, 1904), V. 10 p. 28.

This would seem to be out of keeping with his emphatic opposition to the assumption of Separate Intellects. But Halevi opposes only the view that there are agencies other than God that move the spheres and therefore inter- fere with divine sovereignty but not to the idea of the existence of pure Intellects. To this philosophical notion, he is completely indifferent. Both Avicenna and Algazali maintained that there were such spiritual beings higher than the movers (see quotations in Steinschneider's Alfarabi p. 115 n. 49).

What does this term mean? It can be taken in the general sense of divin.e nature or being, in which case Tibbon's rendering is correct, or else in the technical sense of the neo-Platonic Logos, in which case the Hebrew rendering is inadequate. The latter is the view of Goldziher who however admits that Halevi did not use the term in this sense with systematic pre- cision."2 Now, it is true that, as A. J. Wensinck has shown, through the channel of the Syrians who were acquainted with the terminology of the fourth Gospel as well as with the works of Philo, the notion of Logos reached the Arabian thinkers, and that sometimes in the writings of Alfarabi and Algazali the word amr has this meaning.13 But it seems very unlikely that this is the sense of the term anywhere in the Kuzari, for the following reasons. 1. If the term amr is used technically, to denote Logos, it is strange that nowhere in the Kuzari is it used alone but is always accompanied, and occasionally several times in the same para- graph, by the word ildhi. This shows that Halevi used the word amr only in the general sense of nature or being. 2. The term is first presented in I 42 as parallel to the three lower grades of being: amr (abi'yi or nature, amr nifsdan or soul, and amr 'aqli or intellect, in all of which the word amr can only have the general sense, so that the expression amr ilUdh to denote the fourth and highest grade can only mean divine nature or divinity. Indeed in the next paragraph he calls it al-iladht, divinity. 3. In III 17 p. 165 reference is made to the amr ilahi as the giver of the Torah, as the one who arranged Israel in the wilder- E AJl e* Cy; ^kJ IS \ 4 j i tJ1 \. ^J I jyxA 4&lt;JSLJ.

If a deutero-deity is herein intended, Halevi becomes the champion of the very doctrine attributed to the philosopher at the beginning of the book, of the aloofness and unconcernedness of the First Cause, a doctrine which he repudiates, as e. g. in the beginning of IV 3. 4. Parallel passages indicate the meaning. Thus the saying: "There is no niggardliness with alamr alildhi" in V. 10 p. 309, is repeated on the same page in the words: "There is no nig- gardliness with Him, blessed be He." The statement in V. 20 p. 345: "The speech .of the prophets when they are enwrapped by the Holy Spirit is dictated verbatim by alamr alildhi and the prophet cannot change14 a single word" is parallel to the passage in I 87, p. 39: "The speech addressed to Moses had its origin in the Creator and was not due to any thought or counsel on the part of Moses." 5. Halevi combats the theory of emanation in IV. 25 and V. 14, and he emphasizes in many places God's unremitting administra- tion of the universe.'5 In V. 21, he warns: "Let us take no heed of the words of the philosophers who divide the divine world into degrees, since we reject anthropomorphism.,6 It is God alone who leads all things corporeal." The assumption of Goldziher and Berger that Halevi opposed only that emanational doctrine which grew out of Aristotle's cosmology and which was poly- theistic but not the neo-Platonic form which was "rich in relig- ious motives", is disproven by the fact that Halevi voices his dissatisfaction even with the emanationism of the Sefer Yesirah.

Even to the philosophical assumption of spirit- ual realities in which Halevi saw no interference with the belief in God's sovereignty, he maintains an attitude of cold indiffer- ence: "we need not accept them nor reject them." It is union with this amr ildht, therefore, the divine essence itself, and not with any intermediary, that constitutes the highest attaintment of man; and in his expressions for this ecstatic state, Halevi goes even beyond Algazali. The latter condemned the use of the terms ittihdd (identification), hulul (fusion), and wusul (union), as inconsistent with true unity,I7 whereas Halevi, either because the word amr muffles the anthropomorphic ring or be- cause Biblical and Talmudic literature paved the way for such utterances, uses ittisdl most commonly, and does not hesitate to employ the term hzulul, though he avoids the term ittihdd except in the exposition of the philosopher's idea of the Active Intellect.,8 But how can this union be effected? Not through qiyds or reasoning. Great, it is true, are the achievements of the philoso- phers in the realm of logic and mathematics. "They established the demonstrable sciences on an unlimited basis and excelled in them and there is no conflict of opinion in those sciences."I9 But they lose all their reliability and unanimity when they enter the realm of physics and particularly that of metaphysics. Halevi examines in detail their theory of emanation (IV. 25, 26; '7 See Duncan B. Macdonald, The Religious Attitude and Life in Islam, p. 187. I8 mxnm (Tibbon: ,p,pT, nip-nm, nimpnn,, nm'n, nrmnnn,).

As far as I have noted Halevi used -mnnmt (Tibbon: nmnnmn,i) only once and not in con- nection with amr ilahi but with the Active Intellect in the exposition of the philosophers viewpoint in I 1 p. 5.

On the other hand, the Hebrew commentators and Buxtorf and Cassel mistook Tibbon's correct rendering nrm,nm in the sense of being united instead of "and they were distinguished." 33</page><page sequence="8">EFROS V. 14, 21), their cosmogony (V. 2-8, 14), their psychology (V. 14), and shows their unconvincingness. The difficulty is not entirely due to their reasoning. "There are things which it is not in the nature of man to conceive by means of reason" (V. 14; I. 64). "There is a curtain of bright light conquering human vision" (V. 21). "A rationalistic faith is open to many doubts" (I. 13). "Proofs are deceiving, leading man to heresy and false thoughts" (IV. 3; V. 16). "The masses do not follow the philosophers because the soul feels the truth" (IV. 17). "There is much in heaven, earth, and sea not known to the philosopher" (V. 14). In place of reason, Halevi offers the direct, mystic experience and the certitude of prophecy. He calls it pin (Tibbon Dyt), a term which he uses sometimes in a literal sense, as personal taste and opinion, and therefore synonymous with qids,20 but mainly as a sufi-term for mystic intuition and therefore antynomous with qiyds. Indeed he finds the difference between the God of Aristotle and the God of Abraham to be due to the fact that the former is proven through qiyas and the latter is experienced through dawq. The term is defined in Arabic literature as a mystic light projected by God into the heart of His chosen and as the beginning of the appearance of divinity.21 Other terms used by Halevi are 'rit'an, the general experience of beholding God, of which dawq is the first taste," also 'inm, ,n: 20 See III 49 where Tibbon rightly kh:ao, opinion. 2x See IV 16, 17 and Kaufmann, Attributenlehre, pp. 121, 234.

He sees the God of revelation and laughs at his former doubts and at qiyds through which he sought God and is ready to undergo martyrdom because of the sweetness of union. He becomes so much at one with alamr alilahi that he no longer cares if he dies. It is a new plane of being, Halevi emphasizes in I 41, as high above that of men as the latter is above that of the animals. Compare Algazali's outcry: "Why should it be impossible that beyond reason there should be a further plane on which appear things which do not appear on the plane of intelligence, just as it is possible for the intelligence itself to be a plane above the discriminating faculty and the senses; and for revelations of wonders and marvels to be made to it beyond the reach of senses and the discriminating faculty? Beware of making the ultimate perfection stop at thyself! Con- sider the intuitive faculty of poetry, if thou wilt have an example of everyday experience taken from those special gifts which par- ticularize some men."24 Halevi too likens faith, in general, to the poetic gift in V. 16 p. 331. Halevi's discussion of prophetic experiences follows so closely Arabian patterns that his Hebrew translator occasionally finds only vague equivalents for his terminology and is sometimes in- consistent and even contradictory. He recognizes two states of prophecy. One he calls ilhdm or illumination (Tibbon: 71m31, but also rnynn, nyn, Int),25 which implants the primary ideas in the human mind as distinguished from the inferred or acquired 23 ,'^m3, nia (Tibbon ,,nw, nmi), IV. 3, 15, 17.

These are two different concepts; for whereas wonders distinguish prophets from saints, kavod or glory may be revealed to both classes and to all Israel. It is a manifestation of divinity and is of the same order as Shekina, nmzo, Fire, Cloud, Image, Form, Rainbow - all attesting the divine word.43 It consists of spiritual forms fashioned out of the fine spiritual substance called the Holy Spirit.4 It is that fine substance which, following the divine will, assumes form when God desires to appear to the prophet, or else it is the totality of angels and spiritual vessels, the Throne, the Chariot, the Firmament, the Wheels, and other imperishable things; that is to say, it is either temporary in its form or permanent but in either case the same essence - the Ruay. ha-Qodesh in a glorious epiphany.45 "And this is the mean- ing," Halevi says at the end of IV. 3, "of the Glory of God, the Angelhood (mznxa) of God, and the Shekinah of God in religious terminology. Sometimes they are applied to natural phenomena, even as it is said: The whole earth is full of His Glory and His Kingdom reigneth in all; but in truth the Glory and the Kingdom (m:zn~) are revealed only to the saints, the pure and the prophets." 4' V. 20 p. 343 (rowii nmrwn z:n nrnrim i Tmn rN1 Oi (MrDKMrt) -nns vpal nxm lion 1i H'3= mn sC.

Goldziher in his introduction to his edition of the Kitdb Ma'dni al-Nafs, ascribed to Bahya, states that the word ,mr'm in the expression ,Dz'vi,a 0n,n1Zli in the Ma'dan means angels and, should be vocalized DTan;?, and that it has its origin in the Koranic O^JG and eif for angels.46 But the expression in the Ma'ani and the statements of Halevi show that it denotes more than angels and its fuller form 'n rn1z as given both in the Ma'ani and in the Kuzari as well as the use of the Hebraic form in the Arabic text reveal a consciousness of an Hebraic concept. Biblical in origin, in a theophanic sense,47 the term was early developed, under the influence of neo-Platonism to convey the sense of a metaphysical entity, so that Benjamin Nahawendi stated that before creation God created the Glory and His throne,48 and Saadia amplified it further by assuming a "second air", a fine all-pervasive substance which was created before all things, and which carried the divine words to the prophets and was the instrument of demonstrations and visions and was designated in the Bible by the terms Glory, Holy Spirit, Throne, and She- kinah.49 In this Saadyanic sense, it became the Hebraic parallel 46 Kitab Ma'ani al-Nafs, ed. by Goldziher, p. 37. 47 See e. g.

Alfarabi says concerning the Active Intellect that "it is necessary to believe that he is the faithful spirit (i. e. Gabriel) and the Holy Spirit and that his rank is called mala- kut."5' "The world of malakut," says Algazali, "is the Preserved Table and the angelic world."5s This will explain why in that passage from the end of IV. 3 it is used interchangeably with nm%iD angelhood (Ar l~o= angel).53 Indeed in V. 10 p. 304, Halevi uses the full phrase mnzt?z 6t4y (Tibbon: rn5zt,n 1Yw) describing it as the world of rest and timeless perception sym- bolized by the Sabbath. Both Alfarabi and Algazali identify malakut with amr,54 and it is tempting to take it also as the meaning of Halevi's alamr alilahi; but considerations, already mentioned, make us forbear. And there is a difference. The vision of the Kingdom and the Glory is granted to those whom the Divine Essence leads.

Indeed in this light we discern more clearly the meaning of the philoso- pher in the opening of the Kuzari concerning the soul of the perfect man that "it becomes an angel and reaches the nether- most rung of the kingdom which is pure from matter and which is the degree of the Active Intellect." Halevi however does not accept this identification. The Active Intellect with its rational- istic and somewhat polytheistic connotations he rejects; but he accepts the 'dlam almalakut, as well as ittisdl dawq, ilhdm, wacz and kardmdt, all of which are terms and distinctions taken from the very warp and woof of Mohammedan doctrine. Escaping from Arabic rationalism, he found refuge in Muslim mysticism which was more congenial to his Jewish teaching.
