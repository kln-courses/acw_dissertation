<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUSAN LAYTON The Creation of an Imaginative Caucasian Geography In a study of English letters from the seventeenth century into the romantic era, Marjorie Nicolson analyzed the rise and persistence of topoi of mountain poetry. Beginning in the 1720s, such celebrated poets as James Thomson proved able to create compelling verse about peaks that they knew only from their reading; and even after seeing stupendous rocky terrain themselves poets tended to produce works conditioned to some extent by previous literary representations.' Such a dynamic, whereby one text becomes the model for another in a continuing pro- cess, also figures in the depiction of the Caucasian landscape by Russians, start- ing with Gavrila Derzhavin. Most Russian mountain poetry is concentrated in the 1820s, when a conception of the southern borderland as sublime wilderness was firmly established by Aleksandr Pushkin in Kavkazskii plennik and then elaborated in verse by such secondary writers as K. F Ryleev, S. D. Nechaev, V. N. Grigor'ev, and V G. Tepliakov. These poets created emotionally charged, ambiguous images of the Caucasus, projecting the untamed territory as a realm of "dread" (uzhas) and "splendor" (velikolepie) and making landscape symbolic of a diversity of concerns (civic courage, artistic inspiration, power, bellicosity). Subsequently, the topoi of mountain wilderness created by Pushkin and the clus- ter of lesser poets of the 1820s and 1830s found further development in the Caucasian stories of Aleksandr Marlinskii and in poems by Mikhail Lermontov. Extending over approximately two decades, this sizable body of interrelated re- sponses to the Caucasian landscape invites analysis as a textual universe-an analysis that will allow us to draw significant conclusions about the effect of poetic rather than scientific geography upon the nineteenth century Russian reader. In previous scholarship devoted to the history of the literary Caucasus, the entire issue of the rise and persistence of topoi has been effectively ignored, in accord with the critical biases of the Soviet commentators who have made the major contributions to this field of inquiry. The Soviet critics present the evo- lution of the literary Caucasus as the steady, triumphant march of "realism," identifying Pushkin as the pioneer of the mimetic tendency.2 As used in discussion of the depiction of landscape in this body of criticism, realism signifies, first of all, the imitation of mountain terrain itself and grants no importance to a writer's indebtedness to other texts. From this standpoint the Soviets attribute decisive significance to Pushkin's opportunity for firsthand observation of the mountain- ous borderland during his exile in the south in 1820-1824. Second, the realistic 1. Marjorie Hope Nicolson, Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory: The Development of the Aesthetics of the Infinite (Ithaca, N.Y: Cornell University Press, 1959), pp. 38, 122, 350.

On this score, Pushkin's sparse representation of scenery in Puteshestvie v Arzrum (1836) is most often cited as the key illustration of a nonemotive, nonrhetorical, and nonsymbolic mode. The poet's recit de voyage does indeed stand in tension against the romantic, symbolic elements of his verse about the mountainous southern borderland. In the history of the literary Caucasus, however, his poetry holds the greater interest because it generated a body of texts that echo one another, making Pushkin himself the most highly influential propagator of imag- inative geography. The Soviet assessment of Pushkin as the founder of realistic representation of the Caucasus has a genealogy leading back to the writings of Vissarion G. Belinskii. The celebrated nineteenth century critic regarded Pushkin's trip to the Caucasus as the crucial foundation of his poetry-a viewpoint articulated most directly in a review of the works of Derzhavin. In Belinskii's mind, the status of Pushkin as a traveler clashed sharply with the situation of Derzhavin, a poet who had depicted the Caucasus without having seen it. In the ode "Na vozvrashchenie iz Persii grafa V A. Zubova" (1804) Derzhavin represented Russia's mountain- ous borderland as a rugged wilderness, complete with a thunderstorm, roaring waterfalls and a swarm of giant serpents, biting one another. The latter detail in particular provoked Belinskii's scorn: In those days a poet had no concern with reality: he relied strictly on his imagination. What did he care that the Caucasus was not India and had no enormous snakes, or that no snakes have ever swarmed in stacks, that hay is the only thing which is piled in stacks, or that snakes have never amused themselves by giving each other transfusions of venom?3 While Belinskii granted Derzhavin many strong points as a poet, his contention that the ode to Zubov demonstrated no fundamental "concern with reality" reflected his general opinion of most eighteenth century Russian literature as an overly bookish, artificial body of writing, which had arisen through the imitation of French classicism rather than by taking direct inspiration from life itself. Belinskii's generally low opinion of eighteenth century Russian literature was matched in strength by his commitment to Pushkin as the writer who had finally secured a new foundation for literary activity, making it an expression of the sociohistorical actualities of his country. Pushkin emerged in Belinskii's essays as a kind of Peter the Great of literature-a radical reformer who had broken with a moribund heritage.4Within such a conceptual framework, the critic as- sessed Pushkin's response to the Caucasus as one of a multitude of particular instances in which the poet had laid a new cornerstone. In accord with his pro- 3. V G. Belinskii, "Sochineniia Derzhavina. Biografiia pisana N. A. Polevym. 1845," Polnoe sobranie sochinenii (Moscow: USSR Academy of Sciences, 1953-1959), 9:298. The presence of these serpents in Derzhavin's ode has continued to be a source of concern in Soviet criticism. See, for example, the effort to define the image of swarming reptiles as zoologically realistic in B. S. Vino- gradov, "Nachalo kavkazskoi temy v russkoi literature" in Russkaia literatura i Kavkaz, ed. V M. Tomakhin (Stavropol', 1974), pp. 20 and 25, n. 78. With the support of a citation from a 1967 report by a traveler who claims to have witnessed such a scene in Azerbaijan, Vinogradov argues that Derzhavin, unwittingly, gave an accurate picture of Caucasian snakes-engaged either in battle or mass copulation. 4.

Zhukovskii's address "K Voeikovu" (1814), as well as Derzhavin's earlier ode to Zubov. The critic praised Pushkin's "lifelike pictures" of the Cau- casus, his "faithfulness" to reality, while dismissing the efforts of both Zhukovskii and Derzhavin as "prosaic."5 The key terms, however, through which a crucial distinction was supposed to be established, did not acquire critical content in Belinskii's discussion. The critic knew that neither Derzhavin nor Zhukovskii had ever visited the Caucasus. Accordingly, "prosaic" implied that these arm- chair travelers had produced uninspired verse, whereas Pushkin's art had sup- posedly been animated by the sight of the "poetic land" itself. But "lifelike" took on no particular definition as an attribute of style, merely functioning instead as a sign of approval in the critic's general adulation of Pushkin. Pushkin himself did not share Belinskii's bias in favor of a literature based on "life." Instead of insisting that the landscape in Kavkazskii plennik was faith- ful to nature, the poet in a footnote to his work proudly called attention to the literary pedigree of his mountains by giving lengthy citations from both Der- zhavin and Zhukovskii. Pushkin expressed general admiration for Derzhavin's "superb ode to Count Zubov" as the first work of Russian literature to take the southern borderland as its locale, while giving special praise to the two stanzas in which the older poet had represented a rugged, rocky wilderness.6 Similarly, in the same note he commended Zhukovskii for his "lovely lines" devoted to a "description of the Caucasus" in the address to Voeikov. Like Belinskii, Pushkin was fully aware that neither Derzhavin nor Zhukovskii had ever set foot in the southern frontier territory, but for the poet this fact in no way qualified the artistic force of their verse. In Pushkin's eyes, the two armchair travelers had more than compensated for their lack of firsthand experience by giving free play to powerful imaginations, stimulated by reading. Derzhavin, for instance, had perused ac- counts written by Zubov and other veterans of the Persian campaign.7 More importantly, Derzhavin was thoroughly versed in early romantic English and German poetry, with which his scenes of Caucasian wilderness display a marked affinity.8 From this standpoint Derzhavin, and subsequently Zhukovskii, both occupied a position in relation to the Caucasus that paralleled Franqois-Auguste- Rene Chateaubriand's relation to the Mississippi territory, which he projected in lush concrete detail in Atala, even though he had not actually visited that part of North America. Thanks to his travels as an exile, Pushkin had gained personal impressions of the Caucasian landscape, but, as he himself underscored by giving literary citations in his note to Kavkazskii plennik, he looked to other poets for models of description. What Belinskii termed Pushkin's "discovery" of the Cau- casus thus was predicated to a significant extent on the writer's discovery of a 5. Belinskii, "Sochineniia Aleksandra Pushkina.

Derzhavin's ode to Zubov represents the Caucasus Mountains in two stanzas quoted in their entirety in Pushkin's footnote. This section of the ode begins by addressing Zubov as a wayfarer from a civilized realm who confronts "Nature's dread and glory" (uzhasy, krasy prirody). Comparable to such eighteenth century British formulae as "pleasing dread," "delightful horror," and "enthusiastic ter- ror," Derzhavin's combination of terms conveyed a vision of the natural sub- lime-a vision compounded of awe and enthusiasm in the face of such vast terrestrial phenomena as the sea and mountains.9 A rage for mountains in par- ticular had become pervasive in European letters by the latter decades of the eighteenth century and had been well aired in Russia before Derzhavin wrote. A major role was played by foreign imports, such as Rousseau's Julie, ou la Nouvelle Heloise, in which the hero St. Preux extols le gout de la montagne. Most notably on the domestic scene, Nikolai M. Karamzin had also promoted a sense of the sublime in mountains in his Pis'ma russkogo puteshestvennika (1791-1792), which gave his readers their first representation of the Alps in Russian. Karamzin expounded upon the "reverential dread" (blagogoveinyi uzhas) that he experienced traveling through Alpine terrain, but his text did not offer a large repository of visual images to stand as correlatives to his feeling. The author speaks, for example, of a "dreadful" waterfall but confesses that his "imagination searches vainly for a simile, a likeness, an image" that could ap- proximate the sight effectively.10 In view of such failures of artistic imagination before the spectacle of rugged mountain territory itself, Karamzin could provide no particular stylistic inspiration for the young Pushkin. On the other hand, Derzhavin (who, in Belinskii's phrase, "relied strictly on his imagination") laid the foundations of a descriptive Russian poetry of mountains by giving concrete content to "dread and glory" in vividly realized images of the Caucasus-images that attracted Pushkin as a fellow poet. The first stanza of the ode to Zubov that Pushkin cited in his footnote is devoted to the "dreadful" aspect of the wild, rocky landscape. Derzhavin rep- resents a pervasive "gloom," "angry rivers in murky abysses," a "rumbling" avalanche, thunder and lightning in the "fearsome mountains." The next verse shows the scene transformed by bright sunshine. Here the poet displays his celebrated talent for rendering the play of light and color: the sun sparkles on 9. Nicolson, Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory, pp. 278-279. As a poet who perceived the natural sublime in mountains, Derzhavin, within the Russian context, stands in contrast to Mikhail V Lomonosov's tendency to reserve awe for the heavens, as in the famous ode on the northern lights. Mountains in particular made no appeal to the artistic imagination of Lomonosov, who makes only the barest mention of them in his poetry, without supplying any descriptive detail. See, for example, his reference to the "high crests of mountains" as one feature of the diverse topography of the vast Russian empire in the second ode to Catherine the Great (1763) in his Polnoe sobranie sochinenii (Moscow-Leningrad: USSR Academy of Sciences, 1950-1959) 8:788. This lack of interest in actual mountains as poetic subject matter coexists in Lomonosov's verse with conventional allusions to the bookish peaks of the classical canon (Parnassus, Mt. Aetna) and also stands in interesting correlation to the matter-of-fact, uninspired attitude toward rocky terrain that he expressed in his contributions to geology: see Pervye osnovaniia metallurgii i1i rudnykh del in ibid., 5:574. 10.

The "golden-crimson sun" gleams through trees of the dark pine forest, "delighting the gaze" and contributing to the generally "splendid" (veli- kolepnyi) vista. Derzhavin's achievement as a poet with the capacity to embody the sublime in concrete images of the Caucasian mountains was furthered by Zhukovskii in the section of "K Voeikovu" that Pushkin also quoted in the eighth footnote to Kavkazskii plennik. Zhukovskii's poem reads in part as a travelogue in verse, representing the trip that his friend the critic and writer Voeikov made in south- ern Russia and the Caucasus in 1813. Comparable to Derzhavin's apprehension of "dread and glory," a notion of awesome beauty guides Zhukovskii's represen- tation of the untamed Caucasian landscape. Touches of "dread" figure in the fifty-three-line passage on this particular region, covered in the poetic travel- ogue: waterfalls roar "in the murk of chasms in the granite cliffs," and the light of day cannot penetrate the "tenebrous" (sumrachnyi) thick of the forest. Unlike Derzhavin, who holds mountain gloom and mountain glory in harmonious poise in the two stanzas of the ode to Zubov, Zhukovskii accents the beauty of the stupendous terrain. Mountain rises upon mountain, "clad in blue mist," and the highest peak stands forth as an emblem of the landscape as a whole: And like a cloud above the rest El'borus gleams in all his glory With dreadful majesty, a hoary Giant capped by a double crest." Here El'brus (today's accepted spelling) functions as a metonymic indicator of the Caucasus's general magnificence-magnificence summarized by the poet as the "splendor of creation" (velikolepie tvoren'ia), meeting the eye at every turn. (This perspective of the delighted observer, surveying the scene, is itself, of course, a motif shared with Derzhavin's ode.) While hailing Derzhavin and Zhukovskii as pioneers of a descriptive poetry of the Caucasus, Pushkin composed his prisoner's tale largely under the spell of Lord Byron, who had become the most popular European romantic in Russia. In Prisoner of Chillon, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and some of his "Oriental" poems such as The Giaour, Byron offered an entire system of romantic formulae, involving travel and adventure in exotic locales, featuring the natural wonders of the world. Pushkin's overall relation to the Byronic model and the role of Kav- kazskii plennik as a stimulus to a multitude of works about voyages and captivity constitutes a long chapter in the history of the romantic poem in Russia.12 The relatively limited subject of mountain glory stands as one of the many aspects of that history. Byron, who declared "to me high mountains are a feeling," cultivated a sense of interconnection between landscape and character, promoting the natural sublime (as embodied in Alpine terrain, stormy seas, and the like) as one integral element of his tales in verse.

By capitalizing on the popularity of Byron, Pushkin launched in Russia an endemic enthusiasm for the Caucasus, whose representation by Derzhavin and Zhukovskii had gone virtually unnoticed by the reading public at large.'3 An element of narrative excitement had been lacking, for instance, in Derzhavin's ode to Zubov, which has a strongly philosophical, allegorical dimension. Zhu- kovskii's poetic travelogue did not possess full romantic power either, since the persona ("you," i.e., Voeikov) merely moves through a succession of places without bodying forth as a lyric hero, engaged with his surroundings. By contrast, Pushkin, in accord with Byronic formulae, represented the Caucasian landscape for the first time in Russian literature as an integral part of an emotional drama- a traveler's tale of captivity in an Asiatic outland, complete with the menace of Muslim savages, an amorous adventure with a native woman, and a narrow escape back to his own country. The extended passage of nature description in Kavkazskii plennik appears in part 1 and is presented from the viewpoint of the Russian hero, after he has been living in captivity for awhile. In this forty-line stanza Pushkin retains (in reverse order) Derzhavin's motif of contrast between mountains observed in a storm and in clear weather. The first part of this section, which deals with the terrain on a calm morning, includes the hero's appreciation of distant peaks: Trudging amidst the gloomy crags During the morning's early freshness, He marveled, staring at the view Of the remote, enormous faces Of mountains, hued gray, rose and blue. Vistas of majesty resplendent! The everlasting thrones of snow: The summits look like clouds in steady Lines to the viewer from below, And rearing tall above the others, Immense and stately, crowned with ice, El'brus-the double-peaked collosus- Stands sparkling white 'gainst azure skies.14 Here Pushkin's attention to the effects of sunlight on the rock faces recalls one of the prominent features in the second stanza of Derzhavin's ode to Zubov, quoted in the footnote to Kavkazskii plennik. But in its particulars of description, Pushkin's representation displays a larger debt to Zhukovskii. Like his prede- cessor in "K Voeikovu," Pushkin places the focus on El'brus as the majestic twin-crested giant, looming above the other mountains and sparkling against the sky. He virtually duplicates the visual image created by Zhukovskii, while ap- propriating one of his key rhymes-dvuglavyilvelichavyi (literally, "two-headed"/ 13.

Pushkin, Sobranie 3:97.</page><page sequence="7">476 Slavic Review "'majestic").15 The passage also exhibits a process of translation into Russian of certain descriptive motifs used by Byron. Verse lxii in canto 3 of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage provides ample substantiation of this point: Above me are the Alps, The Palaces of Nature, whose vast walls Have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps, And throned Eternity in icy halls Of cold Sublimity, where forms and falls The Avalanche-the thunderbolts of snow!16 In an extension of Thomson's and Alexander Pope's formula "eternal snows," Byron represents snow and ice enthroned forever-a notion expressed by Push- kin too (prestoly vechnye snegov). Byron also draws the association between snowy peaks and clouds-an element that figured already in Zhukovskii's pro- jection of El'brus and then resurfaced in Pushkin's text as well. In addition, Byron compares the Alps to walls-a metaphor echoed near the beginning of Kavkazskii plennik, when Pushkin conveys the newly captured hero's feeling of entrapment in Circassian country. After celebrating the glory of mountains, touched by the rising sun, Pushkin turns to the representation of a violent storm, observed by the Russian prisoner: When thunder boomed-a storm's first presage- And turned into a rumbling peal, In mountains high above the village The captive frequently sat still. Below his feet the clouds grew somber, Dust swirled across the lowlands yonder, In fright the deer began to search For shelter in their rocky perch; From cliff sides eagles took to flying, Filling the heavens with their crying; The sounds of horses, lowing cows Were muffled by the tempest's volume. Then lightning flashed, erupting clouds Sent rain and hail into the valleys, The torrents undermined the steeps, As flowing water surged in billows And dislocated age-old boulders, While lonely on a rugged peak The captive watched the heavy glower, Waiting until the sun returned, Protected from the tempest's power, And with a certain joy he learned To hear the impotent storm howling.17 15. This stylistic feature is not matched in the English versions of the poetry. Although literal translations would bring such instances of common vocabulary into sharper relief, they tend to make tedious reading. Thus, I have made the effort to capture elements of rhythm and rhyme. While this necessarily involves some paraphrasing of the original, the translations give a valid demonstration of the general principle of shared diction in the texts of Zhukovskii and Pushkin. 16.

Thus, his hero takes pleasure ("a certain joy") not only in the Caucasian range, illuminated by sun, but also in the spectacle of the rugged country, ravaged by a howling storm. In expressing this kind of delight with the wildness of nature in mountain terrain, Pushkin was participating in the latest literary fashion, whose origins lay in England, but at the same time his representation, juxtaposing sunshine and tempest, shows strong links to the texts of Derzhavin and Zhukovskii, who commingled splendor and gloom in their Caucasian verse, written before the heyday of romanticism in Russia. The rhetoric of sublimity and patterns of imagery that interconnect the po- etry of Pushkin with that of Derzhavin, Zhukovskii, and Byron produced a highly literary landscape in Kavkazskii plennik. In addition, certain techniques of dis- tortion in Pushkin's poetry also helped lay the foundations of an imaginative geography of the southern borderland. In Kavkazskii plennik the poet disre- garded a key principle of realistic representation by jumbling topographical in- dicators. The poem purports to feature Circassians-natives of Kabardia, where the Kuban' River is located. Pushkin had spent some time in this western region of the Caucasus, but during his travels his imagination had been keenly aroused by the Terek River-the tributary of the Caspian Sea that formed a border between Russia's Cossack settlements and Chechen territory. With no concern over the resulting incongruity, the poet invoked the Terek and the Chechens in the poem's pseudofolkloric "Circassian Song," sung by young women of the tribe. Pushkin remained untroubled by such matters of geographical definition a few years later, when he wrote "Kavkaz" (1829). In this verse the narrator, admiring the vista from a high bluff, performs the humanly impossible feat of seeing both the Terek and Aragva rivers.'8 This violation of actual topography resembled Zhukovskii's displacement of El'brus into the immediate vicinity of the Terek in "K Voeikovu." By taking this sort of artistic license, the poets created a height- ened image of the Caucasus as a realm where the stupendous phenomena of nature stood juxtaposed, densely contained within a relatively limited space. The southern borderland acquired accordingly a somewhat stylized character as the "country of mountains," the "Caucasian Alps."19 Poets writing immediately in the wake of Kavkazskii plennik invoked Kabardia, Abkhaziia, and Dagestan but represented their locales as generic mountain country, clearly indebted to Push- kin.20 The secondary writers who took the southern mountainland as a theme in the 1820s and 1830s echoed the vocabulary of "dread and glory," while lavishing attention upon peaks, newly claimed as territory for literary exploitation.

As a major representative of the first tendency, the Decembrist Kondratii Ryleev projected the mountain as an embodiment of "Grazhdanskoe muzhestvo" (1823), drawing upon the image established by Zhu- kovskii and Pushkin.21 Ryleev's El'brus looms in "awesome beauty," "a hoary giant" shining in a "hazy fog"-the "glory of the Caucasian mountains," rising high above the clouds. Thunderstorms "rumble" around the peak, rivers "roar," and the wind "howls" through the canyons. S. D. Nechaev employed the same diction in "Vospominaniia" (1825), a more personal response to the "hoary Caucasus," which directs special attention to the "terrible" (groznyi) but "splen- did" (velikolepnyi) El'brus.22 Like El'brus, Mt. Beshtau became another favorite landmark in literature, usually qualified by the epithet "gloomy" (pasmurnyi), a word Pushkin had applied to it in Kavkazskii plennik. This rhetoric of "gloom and glory" runs as a unifying thread through the work of poets of marked in- dividual talent who made the southern borderland speak of a diversity of con- cerns, ranging from "civic courage" to a secret love affair.23 The "wild, awesome beauty" of the Caucasus embodies "dread and charm;" the poetic persona fills with "wonder," gazing upon lofty mountains, capped by "virgin snows" and a "bright raiment of ice." The representation of cliffs and peaks is complemented by the poets' attraction to violent downpours and "stormy," "mutinous," "rag- ing" rivers and waterfalls. These expressions of enthusiasm for the spectacle of untamed nature belonged to the broad stream of Russian romanticism and ex- emplified a shift in aesthetic sensibility, generally effected by the early 1820s.24 Pushkin did not, of course, engineer this shift single-handedly, but he discovered in the Caucasus one of the richest territories for literary activity. While popularizing a rhetoric of sublimity, Kavkazskii plennik created a symbolic aura around mountains, making them representative of certain human attitudes and activities. One of the major clusters of associations centered upon a notion of the southern borderland as a home of poetry. In his dedication to N. N. Raevskii (with whom the poet had spent an enjoyable time, traveling in the south), Pushkin in Kavkazskii plennik called Beshtau his "new Parnassus" and hailed the mountain country as the realm of "inspiration's wild genius."25 This notion of the southern frontier region as the site of a Mt. Parnassus is reinforced in the epilogue, which represents the muse as the writer's traveling companion, flying to "Asian borders" to gather a garland of "wild Caucasian flowers." The perception of wild mountainous landscape as a realm where imag- ination soars belonged to the romantic canon promoted by Byron, who in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage contrasted the Alps' inspirational power to the torturing "hum of human cities" (canto 3, lxxii).

This pseudofolkloric creation (which became popular in its own right and appeared in several anthologies) lent a touch of artistic creativity to Pushkin's Caucasian tribesmen, encouraging Russian readers to perceive them as Ossianic figures, endowed with a primitive energy, tapping the wellsprings of poetry itself.26 The perception of the Caucasus as an engagingly wild haunt of the muse became a prominent leitmotiv in the work of secondary poets, following Push- kin's great success with his verse narrative about captivity among the Circassians. An immediate response to the notion of a "new Parnassus"appeared in E. P. Zaitsevskii's "Abaziia" (i.e., Abkhaziia, written 1823, published 1825). Zaitsev- skii celebrated the Caucasus as the "country of wild beauty," where the poet's soul communes with jagged, ice-capped peaks, the rapid streams, the forests, and the villages of savages. "Ecstasy and pleasure" swell his breast, as he breathes the "fire of sacred poetry." The same notes of spiritual exultation are struck in V N. Grigor'ev's "Beshtau," written in 1826; V G. Tepliakov's "Kav- kaz" (1829); and L. A. lakubovich's "Skaly" (1835).27 A. Ia. Meisner also con- tributed to this Caucasian theme in "Vid Kazbeka v polden"' (1833), adding an anthropomorphic touch by projecting the peak itself as an "inspired man, stand- ing above the crowd."28 All of these poets elaborated Pushkin's notion of Par- nassian inspiration along quasi-religious lines, making their mountains symbolic of spiritual uplift and escape from the vanity of the world. They represented the Caucasian peaks not as the home of poetry alone but as the realm of "higher things" in general, thus reviving in romantic guise a medieval idea of earthly paradise being located on a very high mountain. From Pushkin's day into the 1840s the motifs of inspiration and spiritual exultation coexisted in the literary Caucasus with another emotive cluster of associations, centered on power, combativeness, and pride. In the dedication to Kavkazskii plennik Beshtau appears as a "majestic hermit," the "five-headed sovereign over fields and auls" (the villages of the tribesmen).29 In accord with this idea of the mountain as the overlord of the land, in the epilogue of the poem Pushkin addresses the territory as a collective, as an embodiment of the Muslim tribes, recently (but only temporarily, as it turned out) pacified by General Alek- sei Ermolov: "Bow your snowy head, submit, Caucasus: Ermolov is coming!" Here in the patriotic finale of the work the snow-capped peaks function met- onymically as the head of a body politic. As a region supposedly subjugated by Russian arms, the landscape is suffused by the poet with the human qualities of indignation and recalcitrance. Without such direct references to Russia's on- going campaigns to conquer the Caucasus, Pushkin also engaged in a bit of 26.

Byron too represented the mountain as "monarch": "They crowned him long ago / On a throne of rocks, in a robe of clouds, / With a diadem of snow."</page><page sequence="11">480 Slavic Review anthropomorphizing in the short verse "Monastyr' na Kazbeke" (1829). Here the poet addresses the peak admiringly, as a majestic presence, looming over its fellow mountains: "Kazbek, high above the family of mountains, your regal tent shines with eternal beams."30 Like the notion of Parnassian heights, Pushkin's anthropomorphic tropes associated with power found further elaboration in subsequent Russian poetry. In "Vospominaniia" Nechaev casts El'brus as the "tsar" of the Caucasus, "sur- rounded by a retinue of servants." Tepliakov developed the same metaphor of an enormous potentate in "Kavkaz," where Beshtau rises as the "five-headed tsar," the "gloomy ruler," wearing a "crown of sharp-pointed crags" and encircled by lesser peaks, standing "guard in granite armor." A variant on this theme of a sovereign and his sentries appeared in Grigor'ev's "Vecher na Kavkaze" (1827) in which snowy peaks are represented as a "row of hoary eyelids"-a metonymic suggestion of a gigantic, humanized presence.31 Some other poets expanded the trope of personification by characterizing peaks as distinctive personalities, en- gaged in verbal combat. This artistic formula shapes D. P. Oznobishin's "Ma- shuka i Kazbek" (c. 1828) and lakubovich's "Ural i Kavkaz" (1836)-verses in which mountains argue among themselves, advancing claims to superiority over one another.32 This poetic conceit of debate between two individualized moun- tains reached a height of artistic expression with political overtones in Lermon- tov's "Spor" (1841).33 In this verse Kazbek, characterized as a brash self- confident type, argues with El'brus (called by the alternate name Shat-gora), a venerable "grayhaired" figure, whose fear that the Caucasus may be attacked is realized as a massive Russian army advances on the territory at the conclusion of the poem. Lermontov represented the two famous peaks amidst their "fellow" mountains, using the word "soplemennyi," which literally designates membership in the same tribe. In developing themes of combativeness and anxiety about the violability of Caucasian borders, Lermontov thus made his anthropomorphized peaks stand quite directly for the native population itself: his two protagonists emerge as towering chieftains, concerned with the destiny of their "tribe." In the literary Caucasus such tropes of personification belonged to a larger structure of thought, posing an equivalence between mountain terrain and the population. This structure was established in romantic terms in the main body of Kavkazskii plennik, in which Pushkin explores a triadic relationship between the untamed territory, the natives, and the Russian hero. The Byronic hero is characterized as an "apostate of society" but a "friend of Nature," who has fled to wild country, seeking to escape the social whirl and an unhappy love affair.34 As suggested by his enthusiasm for rugged peaks and violent storms, he recog- nizes in these phenomena a restless, untamed quality that corresponds to his own inner turmoil and disaffection from the conventional urban world. In elab- orating a grand theme of human relation to nature, Pushkin assigns a large role to his Circassian heroine, who is characterized with nebulous suggestibility as a 30.

This designation implies that a life close to untamed nature has fostered in the ardent heroine a capacity for strong, spontaneous sentiment, just as temporary contact with the rugged landscape has stirred the jaded spirit of the Russian hero. Within the drama of unrequited love, the rubric "maid of the mountains" stresses the primacy of the native woman's affinity to the realm of wild, virgin nature, instead of the sociocultural world of the tribe. Pushkin, however, also integrates the Circassian warriors into the structure of parallelism between na- tives and terrain, even though no individual tribesman assumes a prominent role in the plot. The representation of the native men is concentrated in part 2 in a 121-line sketch that depicts the warriors' style of dress, weapons, horses, festiv- ities, and war games on the Muslim holiday Bairan, the ambush of a Cossack border guard, and the hospitable reception of a native traveler in a mountain village. This sketch of tribal life is projected from the standpoint of the Russian hero and appears immediately after the representation of the savage storm. Push- kin insists on the parallel between elemental nature and the tribe: just as the "European" captive finds untamed landscape exhilarating, so also does he feel drawn to the Circassians' "life of simplicity"-the whole cultural milieu of a "wonderful people" (chudnyi narod). By referring to the protagonist as a "Eu- ropean" in this context, the poet stresses his roots in a realm of "civilization," which is pitted here against the more primitive Caucasian sphere. Most signifi- cantly, the rhetorical dynamics of Kavkazskii plennik place the Circassian tribe on par with nature in its duality. Just as the terrain is represented in terms of dread and glory, so do the natives emerge in Pushkin's text as "savage" but "wonderful": the tribesman as loyal friend and generous host counterbalances the "treacherous predator"; the charm of supposedly local poetry (the "Circas- sian Song") exists alongside menacing bellicosity; and the heroine's intense emo- tionality has its fearful counterpart in the explosions of violence amongst the warriors. In interconnection with the influential poems of Byron himself, Kavkazskii plennik inspired a steady stream of Russian writers to elaborate their "feeling" for mountains during the period from the early 1820s into the 1840s. Pushkin's role in this process may be likened to that of the man who plants a seed but does not reap the crop. The great poet himself created only a small number of texts depicting the awesome beauty of untamed mountain territory, and, even at his most romantic, he showed relatively more concern with projecting a clear visual image than with emoting in the fashion of Byron. Significantly, some of Pushkin's letters, concerning his travels in the south, contain some extremely unexalted comments about mountain terrain. For example, in an epistolary sketch addressed to Del'vig, Pushkin said that the passage through rugged, rocky areas of the Crimea had left no trace on his memory.35 What he remembered most vividly was the incongruous sight of a northern-type birch tree there in the mountains and also the amusing custom of holding onto the ponies' tails, while climbing steep slopes on foot. Though not displaying such indifference to land- scape itself, in a letter written from the Caucasus to his brother in 1820 Pushkin expressed no wild outpouring of enthusiasm for the mountains, even though he 35. Pushkin, "Otryvok iz pis'ma k D[el'vigu]," Sobranie 7:280-281.</page><page sequence="13">482 Slavic Review duly noted that they looked "splendid" (velikolepnyi).36 This relatively restrained attitude set Pushkin apart from famous British romantics, such as Byron and Shelley, whose letters and travel journals overflow with the same awed but ex- hilarated "feeling" for savage nature that they cultivated in their poetry. To complement his divergence from such features of the romantic pose, Pushkin disdained the cultivation of exalted sentiment for mountains even in some of his most relevant verse itself. This absence of a highly subjective, emotive response to landscape is particularly notable in "Kavkaz." In this poem, which presents a panoramic scene, the terrain is projected, for the most part, as a succession of precise visual images, coming into view as the undramatized narrator directs his gaze steadily downward from the high point where he stands. While Pushkin's complete body of poetry about the Caucasus displays un- romantic qualities of precision and restraint, it nonetheless brought into currency in Russian literature mountain topoi inherited from previous traditions and taught other writers the techniques of distortion and heightening that yielded an imaginative rather than empirically grounded geography. Instead of mimesis, understood as imitation of a preexistent reality, Pushkin offered a poesis in his verse.37 He did not so much discover a "poetic land," as Belinskii phrased it, as make the land poetic. Even after Pushkin himself had sought in Puteshestvie v Arzrum to render the Caucasian landscape in a manner free of stylistic, emo- tional distortion, his romantic textual uwiverse from earlier years continued to be perpetuated in Russian belles lettres. From 1822 into the 1840s symbolism and subjectivity reigned in the literary Caucasus, as writers subordinated pic- torial images to emotive projections. In this process the belletrists who came after Pushkin brought to fruition the seeds sown before them: a Pushkinian formula, such as "snowy head" or "family of mountains," blossomed into elab- orate poetic conceits of peaks as tribes, sovereigns, sentries, inspired loners, combative debaters. Particularly in the work of full-blown romantics, such as Aleksandr Marlinskii, the very system of parallelism between rugged terrain and natives found much more florid expression than Pushkin had given it, either in Kavkazskii plennik or in shorter poems, such as "Kavkaz." The latter verse, for example, contained a symbolic representation of the turbulent Terek as a "young beast," encaged by the steep rock walls of a mountain pass.38 Here Pushkin was injecting a motif of animation into a poem that relies essentially on precise visual imagery. For such a romantic as Marlinskii, however, the notion of the river as a living creature was expanded in Ammalat-Bek (1832) into the central metaphor of a story that builds a parallel between the stormy Terek and the passionate, mutinous Caucasian hero himself. Similarly, in "Dary Tereka" (1839) Lermontov expanded Pushkin's trope of the animate river into a grandiose representation of the river as a boastful, savage vassal, living in tributary relationship to a venerable "elder"-the Caspian Sea.39 36. Pushkin, letter to L. S. Pushkin, 24 September 1820, ibid. 9:19. 37. Compare a similar formulation in another context in Geoffrey H. Hartman, Criticism in the Wilderness (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1980), p. 23. 38. Pushkin, Sobranie 2:266. In a quatrain generally regarded as a conclusion to "Kavkaz" and given in notes to the poem in standard editions of the poet's works, Pushkin draws a politically charged correlation between the "caged" river and the Caucasian tribes: "So turbulent freedom is strictured by law, / So government torments the heart of a savage, / So now does the Caucasus rankle in silence, / So alien power oppresses the land." 39. Lermontov, Sobranie 1:43-44.</page><page sequence="14">The Creation of an Imaginative Caucasian Geography 483 Pushkin's own poetry did not provide a complete model for these brands of floridly realized metaphors. His representations of the Caucasus, however, laid the foundation of the entire ideational structure within which terrain was read as a sign, designating such attributes of the local population as rebelliousness, love of liberty, stormy passion, brashness, pride. As represented in a definitive body of Russian texts from the early 1820s into the 1840s, the physical environ- ment of the Caucasus and the mountain natives mirror each other, bearing pre- cisely those qualities that the writer's imagination insists that they must bear.40 Such a system in nineteenth century Russia's treatment of the southern border- land constitutes a "poetics of space" of the sort observed in other literatures, with reference to other regions of the world.41 By employing the artist's craft, relying on rhetoric, tropes, and patterns of symbolism, writers can project onto a particular geographical entity certain values and emotions, thereby creating an affective, poetic "meaning," which may far outweigh the force of an objective description of the locale, being viewed by comparison to one's native realm. Even as empirical knowledge about the "other" sphere grows, imaginative ge- ography may persist rather than be dispelled; it may infuse history and other fields of scholarly inquiry or actually override them. In the case of Russia, what became of the romantic poetics of space as positive knowledge about the Caucasus accumulated? Beginning in Pushkin's own time, some commentators started protesting against poetization of the mountainous borderland and attempted to arouse the public's interest in more factual information. Semen Bronevskii took such a stand in the introduction to his widely read survey of the history and geography of the Caucasus, published in 1823. At that early date, before the spate of Caucasian literary thematics that appeared after Kavkazskii plennik, Bronevskii was urging his readers to forget the legends of antiquity, which associated Russia's southern frontier territory with such figures as Prometheus and Medea, making the region a realm of myth-a "land of fairytales" (volshebnaia strana).42 The next two decades brought not only modern Russian literary works, which were creating new kinds of romantic legends about the Caucasus, but also a growing number of scientific studies, as Russian ethnographers, botanists, mineralogists, and social statisti- cians studied the southern borderland and published some of the results of their investigations.43 In addition, military men began writing accounts of their ex- periences in the Caucasian War, often intermingling history with personal rec- ollections. Belinskii praised a book of this sort in the 1830s, claiming that these "sensible, factual works" were filling a gap by offering Russian readers solid information about the Caucasus.44 A reviewer discussing another military memoir 40.

In this commentator's opinion, belletrists since Pushkin in the 1820s had been dealing "more with fantasy than with the Caucasus in ac- tuality."45 Now however, the journalist predicted, a "wealth of facts" would dis- place the fanciful Caucasus of literature. Despite the steady growth of factual knowledge about the Caucasus and the discussion of the territory in nonfiction genres, such as memoirs and the essay, during the 1840s and 1850s, can it really be said that the poetic Caucasus was eventually supplanted by a more rational, empirically grounded view of the mountain land and its inhabitants?46 This question cannot be explored thoroughly within the present article, but we can close by suggesting a hypothesis. In the 1860s Lev Tolstoi in Kazaki still felt compelled to try to undercut the popular enthusiasm for Caucasian romances with their thematic complex of awesome paysage, love, and adventure-the major ingredients first offered to the reading public by Pushkin in 1822. The romantic literary Caucasus remained alive not only in prose fiction but also in travelers' accounts. Decades after Pushkin in Puteshestvie v Arzrum and Polezhaev in Erpeli (1832) had deliberately stripped the scenery of exotic allure, Russian visitors to the southern borderland continued to view things with eyes trained by the poetic representations of Pushkin, Mar- linskii, and Lermontov-enthusiastically citing literary texts as "accurate" ren- derings of the landscape.47 In other words, they went on perceiving what belleslettres had prepared them to see. Apparently unimpressed or simply un- inspired by the nonfiction authors and book reviewers who, already in Pushkin's day, had begun to make efforts to dispel the aura of poetry and legend that surrounded the Caucasus, these travelers gave eloquent testimony to the per- sisting appeal of the geography of poets. In the nineteenth century this supremacy of poetry struck F Bodenstedt, an author and a translator of Lermontov: Just try to name a single book-out of that vast number of thick geographies, histories and other sorts of works about the Caucasus-through which a reader might become acquainted with the characteristic nature of those mountains and their inhabitants as vividly and truly as he comes to know them in one of Lermontov's Caucasian poems.48 Bodenstedt, who wrote verse himself and also authored one of those "thick 45.

When taken along with the other kinds of consider- ations that have been raised in these pages, Bodenstedt's personal conviction about the privileged place of belles lettres over rational intellectual discourse lends weight to the supposition that the romantic poetics of Caucasian space did indeed persist in Russian society, instead of being superseded by scientifically accurate objective perceptions. In view of Tolstoi's embattled recognition of romanticism's continuing force in the 1860s, the literary enthusiasm registered by Russian travelers in the Caucasus, even into the twentieth century, and the comparative perspectives on cultural "spaces," established in the works of schol- ars concerned with other geographical entities, we have a solid ground for arguing the tenacity of imaginative geography. As Bodenstedt implied, the poetic mode retained a hold on the imagination and emotions of readers. The poetic Caucasus, charged with ambiguous, affective meaning as an Asiatic wilderness, continued to coexist alongside scientific and historical data-perhaps even infusing that data in some instances, but, at the very least, providing something more than the fruits of intellectual inquiry.</page></plain_text>
