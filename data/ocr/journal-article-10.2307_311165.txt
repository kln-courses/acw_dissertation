<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LYCIDAS OF THEOCRITUS' IDYLL 7 EDWIN L. BROWN In memoriam George H. Brant Tr O begin by placing the Lycidas of Idyll 7 in minimal context, the dramatic date of the poem in which this choice Theocritean figure appears was the immediate past. The late 270os B.C. may not be far wrong, whether the narrator Simichidas is in some sense Theocritus himself, as seems natural to infer, or not. The setting is the isle of Cos and the season the time of threshing. To help celebrate the Feast of Demeter among friends in the country, the narrator and two comrades set out from town on foot. In the heat of the day they come upon Lycidas, a goatherd whom Simichidas induces to exchange songs with him, as well as pleasantries and even considered opinions on poetry. After the songs, Lycidas gives the narrator his throwing stick, then takes his separate way while the townsmen go on to enjoy the Harvest Home. Even so brief a summary makes room for the peculiar feature of a goatherd not only reciting his own poem but also criticizing others' literary standards. As K. J. Dover summarizes in a fine review of the scholarship on Lycidas,' he may be a real Coan goatherd with a genius for poetry, a real poet who "dropped out" of urban life by dressing and behaving like a goatherd, a real poet whom Theocritus has chosen to picture as a goatherd, or a wholly imaginary character. "One element in the poem seems to point positively towards the third and fourth interpretations: that is the fact that Lykidas speaks ... with the relaxed, slightly patronizing confidence of an older man ... to a promising youth, and also presents him with a stick as a gift. This gift could not fail to remind any Greek of the famous incident in Hesiod &lt;when the Muses&gt; 'plucked a sprig of sturdy olive and gave it to me as a sceptre . . . and bade me sing of the immortal gods.' " One recalls as well that Archilochus tells of an encounter similar to Hesiod's with the Muses, and of a similar token conferred.2 Even Horace's "Lesbian lyre from the Muse" (Odes 1 Theocritus: Select Poems, ed. K. J. Dover, with Introduction and Com- mentary (1971) 148 f. 2 A. Kambylis, "Zur Dichterweihe des Archilochos," Hermes 91 (1963) 129-150; W. Peek, Philologus 99 (1955) 4-5o. An interesting sidelight on the fame</page><page sequence="2">60 Edwin L. Brown 1.1.33 f) may be founded on a scene in which Alcaeus received, again from the Muses, Orpheus' lyre.3 Still other instances of the Divine Encounter motif could be cited,4 all of which should warn against accepting Lohse's conclusion5 that the poet had to consecrate himself through the agency of his own herds- man-figure Lycidas because no historical person existed to whom Theocritus was indebted for the genre of pastoral. Hardly more satisfactory is the position of Mario PuelmaO and of Archibald Cameron,7 who revert to the theory of a historically real poet, though one now unidentifiable. Yet their researches are potentially of great value because they demonstrate that detail after detail of the scene involving Lycidas and Simichidas conforms to the conventions of a Divine Encounter motif traceable throughout Greek literature. Both recognize too that these conventions are combined with the topos of the Poet's Conse- cration, a theme that begins in Hesiod and long continues to influence the poets' way of viewing their vocation. But it is Georg Luck who first drew the logical conclusion that just as elsewhere the authority to ply the poet's craft is regularly conferred by divine agency, so also in Idyll 7 of this meeting is shed by a mid-fifth-century whiteground pyxis in Boston, whose scene is interpreted by E. Zwierlein-Diehl in MDAI (A) 83 (1968) 186-199, pl. 65, following N. M. Kontoleon, 'ApX. 'Ek~fLn. 91 (1952) 32-57, and illustrating (pls. 67-72) other Dichterweihen, two perhaps Archilochus'. 3 For the possible depiction of this warrior poet's commissioning by the Muses and the heroized Orpheus at the site of the latter's oracle on Lesbos, see Margot Schmidt's "Ein neues Zeugnis zum Mythos vom Orpheushaupt," AK 15 (1972) 128-137, who illustrates (pls. 39-41) a red-figure calpis (ca. 440 B.c.) in Basel. Schmidt herself proposes (p. 132) as the poet receiving inspiration there Terpander, partly because he was born at Antissa, where by one account Orpheus' singing head floated ashore from Thrace (Antigonus Caryst., Mir. Hist. 5). The oracle, however, prophesied to Aeolians generally and to Ionians beyond (Philostr. Her. 5-3). Entirely plausible, then, is a tradition that it inspired Alcaeus of Lesbos, whose song is said by Horace (2.I3.33-36) to hold the denizens of Hades spellbound, just as Orpheus' did according to Verg., Geo. 4.478-48o. 4 K.

It is unclear whether Dover's inter- pretation (iv), which he ultimately favors (n.i, above, I5o), and according to which "Lykidas is a symbol of the bucolic world" leaves room for the being who traditionally personified that world. 6 "Die Dichterbegegnung in Theokrits 'Thalysien,' " Mus.

Frederick Williams alone has taken the final step of identifying the deity within this mysterious goatherd.9 He begins with the three obvious clues - the name Lycidas itself, his place of origin, and his destination - the same points of information, he notes, that a stranger was expected to provide in epic, except that there he might state the purpose rather than the goal of his journey. In what follows I shall adopt the same order as Williams for examining the evidence. But whereas for Williams the clues point to Apollo as the god presented in the guise of Lycidas, I hope to demonstrate that these indicators unite in identifying the goatherd as Pan, natural divine patron of bucolic poetry. I For Williams the very name Lycidas not only recalls Apollo's title AVKtos, but is even formally equivalent to it.1x Assuming that "Lycidas" can suggest the epithet Lycius, let us examine where the clue leads. Williams asserts that Apollo was worshiped in Cos under the title of 'ArrAwv AdV'Kos,11 and that both AV#*KlSO and "its by-form" AV6KELOS connote "a specifically pastoral function of Apollo, the killing of wolves."'2 Thus the poet would have chosen the name Lycidas for Apollo pointedly enough. Yet both titles denote no more than "of or belonging to a wolf."' In this sense neither is in principle restricted to association with Apollo, and in fact an Arcadian inscription (IG 5[2].93 S "Zur Deutung von Theokrits Thalysien," Mus. Helv. 23 (1966) 186-I89. 9 "A Theophany in Theocritus," CQ z2 (I971) I37-145. 10 The formal equivalence of the two should not be pressed in the light of Aitchison's and Whallon's more recent studies of the formula iyas TeAap1,vo AXasr for Telamonian Ajax in Homeric epic. Both scholars (J. M. Aitchison, "TEAapwvwos ALas and other Patronymics," Glotta 42 [1964] 132-138; William Whallon, "The Shield of Ajax," YCIS I9 [1966] 26-28, 36) conclude indepen- dently that TehatapvwSo was originally a descriptive epithet denoting the telamons of Ajax' great shield and sword (cf. ',yas ropvu0aoAo "E.,orwp). Once this archaic battle equipment was thus misinterpreted, TEAatmdwos inspired the other -wso patronymics in Homer.

Brown Tegea) attaches AV'KELOS to the native god of Arcadia, Pan. Once the reader of Theocritus is oriented toward that god's aboriginal stronghold, the place-name that readily suggests itself is AV'Kacov, the Lycaean Mount which became the chief cult center of Arcadia in classical times. From this sacred district, where the Arcadian national games took place, both Pan and Zeus derived their epithet AV'KaLoS, which in Pan's case stands foremost among his cult titles.14 Besides the cluster of place- names like Lycaeum, Lycoa, and Lycosura,15 Arcadian personal names containing the element AVK- include that of Lycaon, mythological king of the Arcadians. But rather than deal further with terms that either echo or, according to Williams, formally equal Lycidas, it may prove more instructive to recall that the Greek AvKlsa' after all means "son or descendant of Wolf" (Lycus).16 Historical persons with names like Aristeides or Euripides were seldom in fact descended from an Aristeus or a Euripus, nor does the tradition tell of Pan begotten by a Lycus. Yet of the four versions of Pan's genealogy apt to have been current by the fifth century B.C. at latest, all name as father a god or hero - Apollo, Zeus, Hermes, Odysseus - whose lupine links are strong. With regard to Apollo, the English mythologists of an earlier generation may have overstated the case: Jane Harrison in writing that "Apollo Lykeios is the wolf god; at first the god is the animal itself, then its protector, then, as civilization advances, its slayer" ;17 L. R. Farnell in conjecturing "that the wolf was once reverenced in Greece, as the sacred animal of a wolf-tribe, and that Apollo A'KELOS . . . emerged from a tribal totem-cult."'s Yet in early Greek literature the wolf does lurk like an iminence grise behind the anthropomorphic Apollo. In the Odyssey, after twenty years' absence Odysseus makes his return fearfully apparent to the suitors, on whom he falls like a wolf, on the feast-day of Apollo. Disguised as a beggar, the hero had already predicted to Eumaeus 14 Theocritus' contemporary, Leonidas of Tarentum, is the first to call Pan "Lycaean" in preserved verse (A.P. 6.188). Vergil (Aen. 8.344) and Dionysius of Halycarnassus (1.32), alike specifying "Lycaean Pan" as the deity to whom the Lupercal at Rome was consecrated, imply that AvKos is to Lycaeus somewhat as lupus is to Lupercus. Cf. also Verg., Geo. I.I6-I7: ipse nemus linquens patrium saltusque Lycaei/ Pan . . . See further, A. K. Michels, "The Topography and Interpretation of the Lupercalia," TAPA 84 (1953) 35-59, esp. p. 57. 15 For Pan's importance at Lycosura see Paus. 8.37.11; at his Lycaean sanctuary, Immerwahr (n.28, below) 193-195. 16 Or "of Lycius."

What- ever the original meaning of this Greek word with its AvK- element, D. J. N. Lee has convincingly interpreted it as signifying "the feast of Apollo."19 Turning to the Iliad, we find Apollo at Book 20.95 ff assuming the guise of Lycaon ("Wolfman" as Pape / Benseler render the name), and recall G. Lavoie's recent demonstration of the aptness of the human and animal forms in which the Homeric gods appear to mortals.20 In the Septem Aeschylus played upon the meanings of AV'KELOS: "Lycean lord, be a very wolf to the enemy," as L / S /J translate line 145, AVKEL dva, KELOS Y~VOU 7-rpa7~r 8alt. And the list of wolf-Apollo ties in Greek literature could be extended.21 For examples from the sphere of classical realia a long series of Argive coins, stretching from the archaic period to about 146 B.C., bears on the reverse the figure of a wolf, often between the dolphins of Apollo, chief god of the city.22 Moreover, wolves were said to form an object of sacrifice to Apollo Lykeios at Argos (Schol. Soph. Electra 6). Though Eckels in his Greek Wolf-Lore found the scholiast's statement difficult to believe, he recognized that the same animal and bears as well are reported by Pausanias as offered in sacrifice at a festival that he personally witnessed in the second century A.D.23 Finally, there are the relevant myths about Apollo which Servius (ad Aen. 4-377) cites to explain his epithet. These include the myth of Apollo's transformation into a wolf at the time of his union with the nymph Cyrene and, again, his assumption of the guise of a wolf at the slaying of the Telchines. To these the tradition attested in Aelian (0o.26 - Apollo born to a Leto in wolf form)24 and still others might be added.25 19 "Homeric AvKodfla~ and Others," Glotta 40 (1962) 171. Inter alia Lee compares the month name Lykeios (Lykeos) in several local calendars. To be sure, on pp. I76-182 he argues for a lyk- "mouse" even before Apollo became a wolf god; and Hermann Koller, "AvKiflas," Glotta 51 (1973) 29-34, defends the derivation from *lik- "light" anew. 20 "Sur quelques metamorphoses divines dans l'Iliade," AC 39 (1970) 5-34, esp. 26-29. 21 Cf., e.g., W. E. Higgins, "Wolf-god Apollo in the Oresteia," La Parola del Passato 31 (1976) 201-205. 22 For a listing of fifty-four issues see T. Hackens, "Le monnayage en argent de la ville d'Argos," Soc. Roy. de Num. de Belgique: Expo. Num. (Brussels 1966) 19-21. 23 The expressed reason for Eckels' doubt was the fact that when Pausanias names wolves and bears, both cubs and full-grown beasts, as sacrifices at Patras, he adds that the priestess of Artemis is there conveyed in a chariot drawn by deer. 24 I. R. Danka in Maeander 26 (1971) 153-167 favors "born of a she-wolf" over "sire of the Lycians" as the meaning of Apollo's epithet AvKrqyeVjS. 25 M. P. Nilsson, Geschichte der griechischen Religion (Handbuch der Alter-</page><page sequence="6">64 Edwin L. Brown Let us grant, then, that Apollo's wolfish links are as strong as Williams could wish. Yet the affiliation of Pan to Apollo may not after all have taken place in time to influence Theocritus. For, Timpanaro has shown that great confusion exists in the scholiastic tradition concerning which ancient authority said what about Pan's paternity, and that in any case the ascription to fifth-century Pindar of the god's birth to Apollo and Penelope, an ascription on which consensus had seemed almost attained, is contradicted by Servius Danielis (ad Geo. 1.16 f).26 The claims of Zeus as father of Pan may therefore be no less venerable and worthy of consideration. A fragment (35, Nauck2) of Aeschylus in fact fathers one Pan upon Zeus himself and another upon Cronus of the previous divine generation. As if this were not enough, Epimenides (fr. 16, Diels5) had made Pan (and the mortal Arcas) the offspring of Zeus and Callisto. Since Callisto, according to a prevalent version of the myth, was daughter of Lycaon, and since Gow believes that Theocritus probably followed the myth as told by Epimenides,27 our poet may well have considered Pan and Arcas twin sons of Zeus but also grandsons of Lycaon. That Theocritus thought of Arcas at least in terms of his descent from Lycaon is proved by his use of the patronymic form Lycaonidas at Idyll 1.126 to signify the mortal twin. It may seem rash to broach the possibility that Theocritus could expect even his sophisticated audience to understand one patronymic form, Lycaonidas, for one of the Arcadian king's grandsons and a second form, Lycidas, for another. Yet Homer himself, whom we repeatedly find furnishing the model or inspiration for Theocritus, seemed to authorize such shortening. At Il. 13.307, for example, a son of Deucalion is addressed as Deucalides. Further, for sheer metrical convenience Homeric epic contains as many as four variant forms for "son of Peleus," tumswissenschaft V.2.I) 12 (1955) 537, staunchly denied Apollo any original character as wolf god; yet doubts persist: see, e.g., R. A. Tomlinson, Argos and the Argolid (1972) 205. 26 Sebastiano Timpanaro Jr., Studi Urbinati 31 (1957) 184-187, demon- strated - without denying the possibility, and in some cases the certainty, that Pindar was cited in other scholia for the Apollo-Penelope parentage - that Thilo had correctly restored Mercurius in Servius Dan. It remains the case that "Lycidas" can be read as "son of &lt;Apollo) Avr'KOS" (cf. Apollonides, "son of Apollonius"). This interpretation of our "goatherd's" name is the more welcome as it would imply that Williams (n.9, above, p. 144) has traced "Lycidas" in the right bloodline, as it were, if not to the right genera- tion, and has correctly identified an allusion to Aetia I, fr. 1.22 in Theocritus' choice of the patronymic "Lycidas." 27 A. S. F. Gow, Theocritus II2: Comm. (1952) 26, ad Id. 1.125, where he cites the scholion on 1.3 and compares that on Eur. Rhes. 36.</page><page sequence="7">The Lycidas of Theocritus' Idyll 7 65 and uses them all, moreover, for the single hero Achilles, not - as here proposed - for separate personalities as widely divergent as Pan and Arcas. The Homeric nomenclature for Achilles holds additional interest for us, since in seventeen cases the patronymic Aeacides, built on the name of Achilles' mortal grandfather Aeacus, is substituted for the hero's own name (cf. Alcides for Heracles). Gow's explanation of Lycaonidas as derived from the grandfather "with the more reason since Arcas' father was Zeus and his mother unmarried," applies equally of course to Lycidas for Arcas' twin brother, Pan. If Pan's descent from Zeus and Callisto is the version to be attributed to Theocritus, the foregoing might well be thought to account for the name Lycidas even without resort to the Greek legends of werewolves that centered on the Lycaean mount,28 to the tradition known already to Plato and, apparently, Theophrastus that he who tastes of the human entrails minced up with those of other victims at the shrine of Lycaean Zeus in Arcadia turns into a wolf, and to the versions of the Lycaon myth according to which Zeus transforms that ill-fated figure into a wolf because of his or his sons' impiety. For my part, I accept the conclusion of Nilsson that the epithet AvKaiZo, derived as it was from the place-name, tells nothing in favor of Zeus as wolf god.29 Accordingly, we may turn now to the sole remaining genealogy of Pan that is demonstrably traceable to the fifth century B.C. Though Herodotus is the earliest certain authority who calls Hermes and Penelope the progenitors of Pan, this version of the god's parentage became thereafter the favorite one.30 It may even be assimilated to the account of Pan's birth in the so-called Homeric Hymn to Pan, which one can readily imagine Theocritus relishing and learning by heart since it is, as Evelyn- White observed, "beyond most works of Greek literature ... remarkable for its fresh and spontaneous love of wild natural scenes."31 In this Hymn Hermes' infatuation for, and his fruitful union with, the vd.tcrn of Dryops is related. Whether Hermes' consort is daughter of Dryops 28 See, for this entire complex of myth and lore, Giulia Piccaluga, Lycaon (1968), whose inquiry is speculative but thought-provoking; W. Immerwahr, Die Kulte und Mythen Arkadiens (1891) io; Eckels (n.I3, above), who may overrate the mountaineer's impulse to dpater les bourgeois; and Sir J. G. Frazer, Apollodorus (Loeb Classical Library, 1921) 390-393, who is more inclined to give the wolf his due. 29 N.25, above, 398-4oo00. 30 The same that, perhaps significantly, Plato was to follow in the Phaedrus, a dialogue to whose influence on Theocritus (n.I64, below) is addressed. 31 H. G. Evelyn-White, Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns and Homerica (Loeb Classical Library, 1914) xxxix.</page><page sequence="8">66 Edwin L. Brown as is usually but doubtfully rendered here, or young wife, as Schwabl has recently argued anew,32 her name is omitted. The crucial point to note may be the fact that the presence of Dryops in this genealogy either as putative father or as grandfather of Pan makes Lycaon again head of the clan from which the god is descended, since Dryops is said to be a son of the Arcadian king.33 So again the designation "Lycidas" (descendant of the Wolfman) would fit Pan, much as "Alcides" (descendant of Alcaeus through his putative father, Amphitryon) served as patronymic for Heracles, whose natural father was Zeus. Whatever the original identity of Penelope who bore Pan, the context in Herodotus shows that the historian equated her with the wife of Odysseus. Frank Brommer in his excellent monograph on Pan supposes that an Arcadian nymph of the same name suffered conflation with the Homeric Penelope.34 Undeniably, the danger of such confusion of local nymph with epic heroine would have arisen, and the above presentation of the pedigree elliptically set forth in the Hymn to Pan is intended to suggest a possible stage in the process of contaminatio. But on the one hand Penelope is nowhere distinguished from her epic counterpart among the no fewer than eighteen versions of Pan's pedigree listed in Roscher's Lexikon (III [i909] 1379-80), while the actual names of several nymphs (e.g., Orsinoe in schol. ad Eur. Rhes. 36) crop up in the rich tradition of Pan's birth. On the other hand Penelope figures by no means solely with Hermes as her mate in these pedigrees. I earlier touched on the scholiastic evidence for Pan conceived by Penelope in union with Apollo. Almost inevitably versions arose according to which Antinous, Amphinomus, or even the suitors all together (ia'v7-Es) begot Pan by Penelope during Odysseus' long absence. Not that her mother- hood necessarily involved infidelity towards her husband: the first Vatican Mythographer stipulates (89) that Mercury's union with Penelope took place after Odysseus' death, and that their son was born near Arcadian Tegea, whence Pan's title "Tegean." Finally, Odysseus himself by at least one account was said to have fathered our multilineal godling. Euphorion is thought to have authored the literary version of this pedigree, which would therefore have come too late to influence Theocritus in his choice of by-name for Pan.35 But 32 Hans Schwabl, "Der homerische Hymnus auf Pan," WS 3 (1969) 12, n.19. 33 Schol. Ap. Rhod. ad Arg. I.I218, 1283. 34 R.E. Suppl. 8, col. 952, 11. io-II and 52-54; earlier scholars similarly: R.E. 37, col. 479, 11. 32-39. 35 It might be argued, however, that the begetting of Pan by all the suitors logically and perhaps historically followed the version in which Odysseus figured as father. Since Tzetzes (ad Lyc. 772) records that already Duris of</page><page sequence="9">The Lycidas of Theocritus' Idyll 7 67 even if the possibility that Penelope and Odysseus are both ultimately "faded deities" of Arcadia has been exaggerated, their deep roots in Arcadian local myths forbid us to ignore the lupine connections also of the hero of the Odyssey.36 It is in the nineteenth book (399-409) that Homer tells how Odysseus' grandfather had named the infant "Odysseus" (as if to echo rToAAoZeUw . . 8VUUvaad*EvoS, "hateful to many" or "angered with many"). But as G. M. Bolling, followed by Rhys Carpenter, noted,37 a Greek grand- father is wont to name the eldest grandson for himself. Accordingly, since in every dialect but the Homeric an 1 sound replaces the d of "Odysseus" (e.g., Aeolic 'OALuua's), since the double s (or, in Attic, double t) should represent an original k, and since the termination -E'S was much used in the heroic period for the formation of short names, Bolling concluded that 'OAvaauev' is the short form of a dedicatory name derived from A0rd'AvKOs - that is to say, from the name of Odysseus' maternal grandfather! Though he felt a difficulty in the presence of the initial o in "Odysseus," Bolling did suggest plausible ways of explaining this vowel, which he took to be part of the first element of A3TdAvKOS clinging to the second. He might also have borrowed a leaf from Wila- mowitz,38 who interpreted the initial o as a prothetic vowel.39 Though neither scholar explained the etymology of "Odysseus" on the basis of the transparent meaning of "Autolycus" - "Very-wolf," to wit - Bolling's conclusion that Od. 19.407 f "may then be considered as perhaps the last obscure echo of a tradition of a connection between the names Odysseus and Autolycus" is the more weighty as he had no special axe to grind. In any event it should suffice to justify the thesis that Odysseus, his "very-wolfish" ancestor, or both could account for our poet's Samos made the suitors responsible, and Duris surely wrote before Euphorion, the latter may only have been the first to give literary currency to the version wherein Odysseus fathered Pan. 36 Ernst Wiist, for example, cited the "unumst6sslicher Beweis fiir das hohe Alter und die tiefe Verwurzelung der Sage von Pans Mutter P. in Arkadien" in his article s.v. "Penelope" in R.E. 37, cols. 479 and 48o, 11. 32-34; in his companion article s.v. "Odysseus" (R.E. 34, cols. I9Io-Ii) he examined the traces, numerous above all in Arcadia (as in Penelope's case; R.E. 37, cols. 463-466), of divine honors accorded Odysseus in the prehistoric period. 37 Bolling, "The Etymology of 'OSvaaev'r," AJP 27 (1906) 66; Carpenter, Folk Tale, Fiction and Saga in the Homeric Epics (1946) 131. 38 U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Homerische Untersuchungen (i884) 18, n.6; cf.

It will be noticed that I have made here no use of the Syrinx, that riddling pattern-poem ascribed both internally and externally to Theocritus. In the first place its actual authorship by him has often been denied; in the second place the riddler, whoever he was, signified that Odysseus was Pan's father neither by the phrase "bedfellow of Nobody" nor by the difficult d7rarwp, which Edmonds took as an allusion to Odysseus' famed Kasename, "Nobody."40 The father of Pan whom all unravelers of the Syrinx since the time of the Greek scholiast seem to agree that its author adumbrated by means of his KAw7ro7raoTwp, "son of a thief," is Hermes. How his inclusion in the most favored genealogy of Pan can be squared with "Lycidas" as the god's by-name I hope to have indicated sufficiently. It may seem odd that I have not stressed the wolf's stealthy stalking of its prey as a theriomorphic model for cattle-rustling Hermes.41 But when Norman Brown in his brief but substantial Hermes the Thief wished to suggest a more recent counterpart to the pagan patron saint of all craft,42 it was to Reynard the Fox that he turned. Perhaps it was a similar feeling that the wolf presented too formidable, even grisly, an aspect to fit the most qAdavOpworo of gods that guided the Greeks in general, and that led Theocritus himself to adopt into literature, for the first time, seemingly, the precise form Lycidas.43 Pan could thus be provided with a by-name appropriate to him in his own right, not merely with a suitable patronymic. For the Doric ending in -8as44 is identical in orthography and metrics with the nickname AvKCSaS created by substituting the favored hypocoristic suffix -as in names with certain endings, including those in -esi, as in *AvKL8E1E5. 40 Better taken as "fatherless" in the sense that all Arcadians, born of the oaktree, are "without fathers": so R. Merkelbach and M. L.

Remarkably enough, AVKL8EVs as a common noun meaning wolfcub is first attested in Theocritus.45 Specifically, in Idyll 5 (and with only the brief sixth Idyll intervening in the received arrangement), the poet introduces the common noun AVKLSEV~, deliberately it may be, to prepare the ground for our encounter with "Lycidas" in the seventh. Many other names signifying the young of various animals and ending thus in -t8EVS might be instanced,46 but only one of these occurs in serious poetry apart from Theocritus', a point that may tell in favor of our poet's ulterior purpose in employing AVKL4VS49 in Idyll 5, where in fact it seems intrusive into an older proverb, and so calls attention to itself. Now in the sermo amatorius of Hellenistic poetry Pan would have been characterized as a "young wolf" as freely as his mortal votaries are in current American slang. Everything we learn about the amorous inclinations of Lycidas in Idyll 7, and about Pan throughout the Theocritean corpus as well as in classical literature generally, tallies with the definitions of the word wolf in its slang usage today. Between publication of Webster's Second New International Dictionary and that of its new edition, wolf meaning "a man forward, direct, and zealous in amatory attentions to women" but also one so disposed towards those of his own sex,47 had been accorded a recognition beyond the transitory fame of dictionaries of slang. But, to look no further, a series of contributions to American Speech traces these connotations to sources at least as early as the sixteenth century.48 In the case of Perrault's Petit Chaperon Rouge we have the appended Moralite guaranteeing the essential fidelity of Bret Harte's poem, "What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding-Hood," to the original literary version of a still older folktale.49 The currency of the story in France long before the Grimm brothers gave it its now familiar twist may account for the expression "avoir vu le loup," which like "to see a wolf" means "to be seduced," though the English idiom also signifies "to-lose one's voice." 45 It is by no means clear that the AvK&amp;SEcVs at Plut. Sol. 23.3 represents the ipsissimum verbum of Solon. 1" Fourteen more may be gathered from Gow, Theocritus 112 (I952) 297-298 ad 15.I21; he also notes the single example from epic. 47 See definitions 4 and 5 s.v. "wolf" in the Third Edition (1961). 48 In vol. 24 (I949) 154. G. Legman cited Sir William Knollys' use of the wolf-and-lamb imagery in 1595. J. H. Wildman (vol. 20 [1945] 231) had anti- cipated one of his later illustrations, from Thackery's Vanity Fair; and W. L. McAtee (vol. 25 [1950o] 267) added the testimonia from Perrault and Harte. 49 So Contes de Perrault, ed. G. Rouger (1967) 112.</page><page sequence="12">70 Edwin L. Brown Now both these idiomatic meanings perfectly suit the context of the question "Have you seen a wolf?" in Theocritus' Idyll 14. Theocritus' choice there of the name "Cynisca" meaning "Little Bitch" (though with fewer pejorative undertones in Greek) demonstrates his penchant for "speaking names" for his characters,50 while the poet's elaborate play on the connotations of Lycus' name in Idyll 14 tends to confirm his fully conscious intent in applying the nickname "Lycidas" to Pan. Again, not only do the actions there of "Cynisca's Wolf" furnish ancient precedent for the English verb wolf in its slang sense "steal another's girl,"51 but the ditty ("That wolf of mine") mentioned in the same poem seems even to have a Gallic ring, since "mon petit loup" means simply "my darling, my pet." In any case, the Hellenic wolf remotely if at all shares kinship with Fenrir and the other lupine monsters of North European myth and story. For the rest, Georg Luck in "Kids and Wolves"52 has traced the other sexual connotations of AV'KOr from Plato down to Fronto, and in so doing has much reduced the chronological distance from Theocritean to Elizabethan "wolves."53 Luck's interpretation in effect illustrates the perfect aptness of "Lycidas" both as "speaking name" for the seventh Idyll's mysterious goatherd, whose own song discloses his bisexual interests, and also as nickname of Pan, whose pan-erotic drive is partly a function of his role as agent of the Great Goddess. Here the case that the name Lycidas in Idyll 7 may properly point to Pan must rest. That I have sought to establish the possibility by multiple lines of argument results from the god's extraordinary wealth of pedigrees (themselves the product of his original isolation from the great Olympians amid the mountain valleys of his homeland, where each cult center was free to elaborate its own version of Pan's parentage), as well as from the suitability to Pan of "Lycidas" as a hypocoristic signifying "Wolfkin." At all events no other word of such multivalent import remains to be discussed, though the dual relevance of a given word, at a connotative as well as at a denotative level, will prove characteristic of Theocritus' further identification of Lycidas through his place of origin and his destination. 50 For further preoccupation (on the jilted lover's part at least) with animal imagery see Alan Griffith's note on Id. 14.26, in CQ 22 (1972) I02-1o06 ad fin. 51 L.

I1.5I the author himself provides the best check on his interpretation of "kids." 53 The question whether the similar use of lupine imagery in classical verse and modern slang indicates a historical connection or merely similarity of mentality between the two must, I think, remain open.</page><page sequence="13">The Lycidas of Theocritus' Idyll 7 71 II "We came upon a Cydonian man," Kv3WVLKOV EVpoCLES i8 a'pa (7.IZ):54 as Williams remarks, this clause has baffled the commentators, for whom "there is no obvious reason why a goatherd from any known Cydonia should be wandering in the by-ways of Cos." But by far the most important of these Cydonias was the one on Crete, whose modern capital Chania overlies the ancient town-site; so Williams proposes to seek the solution there, and finds it in Stephanus of Byzantium's entry under KvSwvta: "polis of Crete, formerly Apollonia; from Cydon son of Apollo and Minos' daughter Acacallis; second, a polis of Sicily; third, of Libya. The male citizen is called Cydoniate, Cydon, Cydonian, Cydonaean, ... and KvSWVLKgS &amp;vjp," this last, surely, straight out of Idyll 7. Undoubtedly Apollo enjoyed cult in this third most notable polity of classical Crete. But though Williams in support of his thesis cites the wreathed head of Apollo on Cydonian coins,55 other gods and goddesses appear more often as coin-types there ;56 understandably, he overlooks the potential importance of Pan on some Cydonian reverses.57 Williams does, however, recognize as probably mistaken58 the late antique testimony of Stephanus, who alleged that Cydonia's former name was Apollonia. What the proponent of an Apolline connection in the phrase KvSJVLKL1 &amp;dv'p must chiefly rely on is the tradition that Carl Wendel traced to Alexander Polyhistor,59 according to which the city-state's name is derived from that of Cydon, son of the nymph Acacallis and a god. Awkwardly enough, the divine father given by the same Argonautica- scholion (ad 4.1492) that specifies Alexander Polyhistor as its authority is Hermes, not Apollo as in Stephanus' entry (which is by Wendel's accounting somewhat garbled). The Cretan version, in whatever variant, was matched, as Pausanius (8.53.4f) informs us, by an Arcadian descent for Cydon from grand- father Lycaon through father Tegeates, eponymous ruler of Tegea. From that Arcadian town Cydon and others are said to have migrated 54 Except as otherwise indicated, the Greek and English of Theocritus' Idylls are excerpted from A. S. F.

Brown to Crete, where they established new foundations, including Cydonia. Whatever the worth of this myth connecting Cydonia and Arcadian Tegea (whence Pan Tegeates), the cultic links of Crete with Arcadia are undeniable.6o To document these is not part of my purpose here, except for one item scarcely available to Williams. In 1969 K. Davaras published evidence61 that the great cave of Lera on the Cynosura62 peninsula just east of Cydonia was sacred to Pan and the Nymphs. For in this cavern, two years previously, he had excavated Attic black-glaze potsherds inscribed with dedications to these rustic divinities. Their common worship in grottoes is not surprising since no haunts were more favored by them; but the earliness of the inscriptional evidence for it, perhaps the earliest of any so far retrieved, is surprising. Nevertheless, though I hope to have shown that Apollo's connections with Cydonia are weaker, while Pan's are stronger, than have been supposed, I submit that the overriding reason for Theocritus' choice of Kv3WVLKdS as ethnic may have lain not in any cultic reference but in a canting one. To return to the coinage of Cydonia, one reverse type depicts Cydon armed with a bow and accompanied by a dog; another reverse type again presents a dog, but this time female and suckling a baby boy. Fortunately we need not determine here the identity of the infant63 whose portrayal on Cydonian coinage provided a Roman mint master with the direct typological model for his representation of the she-wolf nursing Romulus and Remus.4 Enough for present purposes to win acceptance of Jakob Pley's conclusion65 that the dog, the KWiv, on coins of Cydonia formed a canting-badge of the state whose abbre- viated ethnic KYAdQN appeared on the exergue.66 But while granting the freedom of Greek puns, one may well inquire why the poet wished to characterize Pan by an ethnic that suggests, since the suffix -LKOS denotes relation, "a man with the characteristics 60 See Pley (n.65, below), who cites further evidence in O.

Earlier, in touching on Pan's role as "agent of the Great Goddess," I was translating - without acknowledging - the Pindaric phrase, ~pEydA /as~/ov Kwov (fr. 96), wherein ioVwv serves as frequently in mythology (according to LSJ s.v. KUWV, III) to designate "servants, agents, or watchers of the gods." I submit that Theocritus echoes this usage in Pindar, whose Hymn to Pan seems to have received much - though misdirected - scrutiny by Alexandrian biographers intent on finding personal reminiscence in the great lyric poet.67 If so, we may gain further insight on the force of KdCov as applied to Pan by noting that, in other verses addressed to the god, Pindar calls him OtbAaW (fr. 95.2) and especially dra78s (fr. 95-3) - not unreasonably if the name "Pan" itself should prove to be descended from dicrdwv.s This etymology for Pan makes the god originally "Companion" to his shepherd votaries and "Guardian" to their flocks, in a literal sense dcrdova ,pqAwv as Pindar called Pan's close congener Aristaeus (Pyth. 9.66b). At the same time, the case for regarding Pan as KVWVKKdO is not solely dependent on the correctness of this etymology; if not verbally and from the outset, then functionally and from the time Pindar termed him "KVdv of the Great Goddess," Pan could be seen as a fellow with traits of the Arcadian herdsmen's Best Friend, and called (by a pun like the Cydonian canting-badge's) Kv3WVKO ' aVp. To some it may seem that so far the chief metaphorical possibilities in Kv3WVrLKd have been overlooked. The Greek for "quince" is PCnAov KvCdvtov, or simply Td Kv86va, 9 and Kv8wovK3V ... ..vSpa might there- fore be rendered "a Quincy chap." If the phrase were thought to allude 67 W. J.

At P. 3.77-79, I submit, after Pindar has regretted that he cannot bring Hieron both health and praise, he determines to do what he can by invoking (for inspiration as at Pae. 6.56?)

Brown to the fruit itself, the quince's pungent fragrance, its villous skin, its ripe hardness, its tart astringency could each make some claim to suggest a distinctive trait or quality of Pan. But when Theocritus (Idyll 10.45) with a;KLVOL aivpe- draws on proverbial expressions likening men or objects to the cultivated fig, it is the tree's wood, not its fruit, in which editors agree on finding the point of comparison. The proverbs cited by Gow ad 10.45 bear out the Hesychian entry auvKwOV, d &amp;OEeS, and Hesychius' corresponding inter- pretation of KVSWoVKdV might be expected to shed light equally on our passage.70 But in contrast to the single connotation "weak," the very multiplicity of meanings offered at KVSYWVKdV' ~)/Eya KaL dedAoyov, adTaT?rAdv, &amp;A&amp;Lov, AolSopov, raises doubts that any of the five, even if based on passages like Theocritus', results from genuine understanding. Yet this cluster of metaphoric explanations may reflect some inkling that there is more to our Kv3wVLKdv than its literal, gentile use, especially as the form is otherwise attested only in Stephanus, where it is listed last among the five ethnica s.v. Kv~ovia. III Before any still latent connotations of Kv3wovKOv ... v8vpa are elicited (later, in the full context of the phrase), an examination is in order of what for Williams himself is the conclusive link between Lycidas and Apollo: the very last words devoted to Simichidas' encounter with the "goatherd." (That it is his private personal experience, unshared by the two friends accompanying him, others, I think, have persuasively argued. From the moment of Lycidas' sudden appearance till that of his carefully signaled turn-off on the road to Pyxa, Simichidas' com- panions remain totally absent from the dialogue and narrative of the poem's entire central core, only to come again into the account the instant Lycidas vanishes from it.) It is the clause reserved for the very close of the encounter that in Williams' view connects Apollo with the actual setting of the poem: 'raYv Hv17as / ETp#E' 08dv (7.130--131) or "took the road to Pyxa," as Gow translates. Williams finds the skepticism of Paton and Hicks71 about the scholion to this verse unjustified and superseded by evidence which R. Herzog was later to publish.7" Yet though Herzog's index lists 'And'AAwov ;v'oS (20.44), the text references provide no inscriptional 70 A. S. F.

Since Doro Levi excavated the cave of Pan at Aspripetra and in 1929 published the best preserved and most important figurines (including standing and seated terracottas of Pan) found in the sanctuary there,76 the most exciting finds have been made within the past few years. Two inscribed reliefs, one of them very fine and dated to the turn of the fifth to fourth century B.c., the other less skillfully worked but close to our Idyll in date,7 represent the Graces in one case as dancing around an altar and attended by Pan in person, in the other as standing in the presence of the god's cult-herm.78 Mesaria, the find-spot of these reliefs, lies about four miles west of the Coan capital and right athwart the route of our holiday hikers - possibly at the very point ('rdv /Erora v o'v) where "by the Muses' grace" they came upon Lycidas.

Still, the great increase since Farnell's time79 of evidence for Pan's presence on the island has not been accompanied by proof that Pan actually received public worship at Pyxa, whose location in any case has yet to be certainly pinpointed.s0 I am therefore inclined to suspect that Theocritus' final words concerning Lycidas do more to characterize him than the bare mention of an obscure Coan town with an externally unconfirmed Pan cult could do.81 In short, I propose to read H176as not, or not solely, as genitive singular of a proper noun but as an accusative plural of the common noun: "He sped his way to the boxwoods," in the sense "to the tune or accom- paniment of boxwoods." For this translation, first, I am assuming that, by using accusative plural 7rm6as for the musical instrument, Theocritus was distinguishing it from "boxwood,"82 the plant species, or was, as it were, adjusting the ending to fit the feminine gender of the Greek word, somewhat as Theophrastus (HP 4.4.6) writes Evi8vV7 for "ebony," though elsewhere it is regularly q Eflevos.84 Second, I am assuming that the Doric form wrotl should be restored. In this bucolic idyll irorl would 79 L. R. Farnell (n. i , above), 467, cites the ancient testimonia, in a brief note (178): "Schol.

Since the Theocritean scholia betray no suspicion of a Lycidas / Pan equation, we need not wonder whether the scholiast is merely deducing a Pan Pyxius from the internal evidence of 7.130. 80 The village of Asphendiou is usually proposed as its present-day successor (see Gow, n.z7, above, 163 ad 7.130); but the question where this ancient Coan deme center lay is still sub iudice: witness S. M. Sherwin-White, Ancient Cos (Hypomnemata 51, 1978) 59, whose historical study came to hand belatedly. 81 The fact that the place name, either t0v'a or Oveal, appears to have been spelled with 0 (epigraphical evidence being so far confined to ovliscrat for the demesmen and t'coso for the cult title), strongly supports the view that Theocritus had ulterior motives in introducing the variant HItas here; cf. R.E. 112 s.v. "Kos," col. 1473-43 and 1474.3o, and R.E. 24 s.v. "Pyxa(i)," col. 619. This possibility was already suspected by Wilamowitz, Hellenistische Dichtung II (1924) 138, as I am reminded by W. G. Arnott, "The Mound of Brasilas in Theocritus' Seventh Idyll," QUCC 32 (1979) 1oz, n.8, an article drawn to my attention by Richard Janko. I am especially indebted to him and to Paul Waring, who noticed the word play in owivota piv AVK&amp;'tSa, s 8' abTrdAo (7.13), for their constructive criticism when I presented a truncated version of this paper in the Cambridge Greek Seminar. 82 "Theocritean dialect" would call for 7r;'SwS (or w'eo!) as the acc. pl. of 7 83 Has an original feivrv at Id. 15-123 been regularized to Eflvoo at the expense of meter? 84 Other variations for a given word occur in Theophrastean manuscripts - e.g., jvvrproS at HP 9.7.3 for &amp;v76ov, olKvov for MlKvos, OdV'ov for Ovjlos.</page><page sequence="19">The Lycidas of Theocritus' Idyll 7 77 be apt, but the manuscripts show this form to have been subject to replacement by other prepositions (by trap' at 6.30, by card at 16.94), including e'7T (at 11.55). Many parallel phrases, among them fpreE roTr' I8av (I.I05), "Be off to Mt. Ida," and rro'tr H'taav prowv (4.z9), "As he was going off to Pisa," may be cited from Theocritus for the surface meaning here, "to or towards Boxwoods."85 But he also uses this same preposition in the one instance in which he unquestionably intends the meaning "to the accompaniment of": trpo Avpav 7r' daELSe (Ep. z21.6),86 "and to sing to the lyre." Except for this isolated use of rpd' by Theocritus, though, I should rather propose as emendation `rod, which for semantic and palaeo- graphical reasons would be still more easily corrupted. This preposition may bear the same extended meaning as trorl, and unlike trorl even takes the genitive case when its sense is "to the accompaniment of."87 That some preposition other than rld originally stood in the text i think the more likely because Theocritus never elsewhere uses 1trl + genitive to mean "in the direction of"88 or any preposition twice in the same verse with different meanings, as would here be the case since E7r' dpwTEpd just precedes ''r 1 HI7s. But precisely this close juxtaposition of prepositions would have increased the chance of a scribe's assimilating the second (either trorl or Vdrr) to the first, especially as the more usual 'rl conveys a perfect surface meaning. But easy to account for though the corruption here hypothesized may be, the question could fairly be put, at this point, whether the secondary meaning of the phrase is so vital to the case for Lycidas' equation with Pan, so necessary to the rounding off of his characteriza- tion, as to warrant all the traffic with linguistic minutiae. The combined weight of all the clues to Lycidas' identity as Pan does, I believe, justify us in reading these terminating words about him as the final tip-off to 81 Yet it may be significant that when Zprrtw is followed as at 7.131 by jddv no prepositional phrase expressing direction of motion is required; cf. 8.75: 7ra acr4epav d0v Etpl7ov. 86 Here the Doric iror' yields as expected to its koine counterpart. 87 E.g., Hes.

It is specified in classical sources as a material used for making rattles (A.P. 6.309), castanets (Propert. 4.3), the phorminx (Theocr. Id. 24.Iio), and the aulos. The first two, percussion instruments, are quickly set aside, since evidence connecting the rattle with Pan is wanting, while the strongest link between the god and castanets is slight enough: Rosen- meyer interprets Pan #LAdKpwoTo in the Homeric hymn to the god (19.2) as "fond of clappers" - if not of all "clatter."91 It is not clear whether the statement in Daremberg / Saglio (I, 2, p. 1572b s.v. "Crotalum") that castanets are found in the god's hands rests on this same testimonium, or possibly on works of art similar to the famed Dancing Faun of Pompeii. A lesser work executed on the back of a silver mirror from neighboring Herculaneum illustrates the occasional association of Pan even with the phorminx, or at least with a stringed instrument of the lyre genus.92 Though the mirror itself is much later, its Pan-type of the musician gripped by the spell of his own playing could go back to, say, third-century antecedents. But though Theocritus' only sure use of a irr?os- derivative was to modify 0b'6pty by the adjectival irvgvva, it is obvious that there (24.11 0) he did not expect the elaborately composite instrument to be implicitly understood unless he added its name. It is quite otherwise with the aulos and its poetic synonyms. This, the all-important wind instrument among the Greeks, is referred to over and again in classical literature simply by the name of the material composing the pipe's body - Aw-r6ds, Kd acLos, 8dvae, or lotus-wood and 89 R. Herbig, Pan (1948) 25: "Der Musik selbst ist Pan eben innig zugetan. Das urtiimlichste -lirteninstrument, die Syrinx, gilt also seine eigenste Erfindung, und fast ausschliesslich dieses Instrument wird von ihm gespielt." 90 From a survey of oboes in European and American collections Philip Bate, The Oboe (1956) 130-132, concluded that between 169o and 1830 the instrument was most often made of boxwood, "at one time the favorite wood for all the smaller musical instruments, and the so-called Turkish variety could be found with a beautiful curly grain which yielded a very handsome finish." 91 Thomas Rosenmeyer, The Green Cabinet (1969) 242-243. 92 Illustrated in J.

That "boxwoods" had even wider currency is shown by the eight poetic passages which the Oxford Latin Dictionary, without being exhaustive, cites for buxus in the sense of "reed pipes." Of highest relevance for us, however, are the testimonia, literary and otherwise, on Pan and the aulos. First, Aristophanes' son Ararus is quoted as writing in his Birth of Pan, "He snatched up a single-pipe (p~vavAov) straightway, you can't conceive how deftly, and began to leap with light step."95 Second, a bucolic fragment attributed to Bion96 mentions a song telling how Pan discovered the vrAaylavAos, which may be the genuine cross-flute.97 Third, though a pipe held thus horizontally is from time to time depicted in classical art, I have in cursory searching found no examples of it in the hands of a Pan figure. On the other hand, young satyrs playing the cross-flute do exist in sculptural copies thought to reflect a fourth-century original of Pan thus piping.98 Fourth, and more interestingly, with surprising frequency Pan, like Greek pipers customarily, is represented playing the &amp;lavAos, or aulos pair.99 In fact, the very earliest depiction of Pan known till now, a late 9a References to the instrument, in the very construction ("to the accompani- ment of") proposed ad Id. 7.130o, occur - e.g., vrpa A4f9vv AaKCev/ av'Adv (Eur.

Brown black-figured krater fragment, presents a still goat-headed Pan playing the double pipe.100 Though recognizing the significance of this and the similar Pan on a Cabiric vase of a century later, Herbig argues that the tradition of the pipe playing goat-god rests partly on a confusion with Marsyas and with Silenus, partly on more or less doubtful restorations of ancient statues.x01 Such has been his success in urging this view that both Dorothy Kent Hill and Dietrich von Bothmer have proposed merely as a possible alternative the original presence of double pipes in the hands of two bronze Pan statuettes they publish.102 Yet the latter of these, a "late fifth or fourth century" piece, is wearing the phorbeia, or mouthband, commonly used to keep double pipes in position. Fifth, and finally, no boxwood auloi have been preserved, though Pollux 4-74 specifies the use of boxwood for the Phrygian type (Av/osg).103 But then no wooden pipes of any species have survived except for the Elgin pipes of sycamore from Attica, now in the British Museum.104 All but this unique pair of instruments are of bone, ivory, or metal.105 From the foregoing it will be apparent that among the musical instru- ments for which the classical testimonia furnish evidence that they were made more or less frequently of boxwood, the double pipes in explana- tion of Theocritus' 7rn'as hold the best claim.

But so halfhearted a solution is really none at all; one could as well argue that the multiple references to av'ptye need not denote the Panpipe per se, but rather the reed mouthpiece of the aulos, for which the technical term was oapLye also. But if the classical annals are mute on the subject of boxwoodPanpipes, ancient works of art are eloquent concerning the god's preference for the Panpipe of multiple channels. Once more the archaeological record offers the possibility for a synthesis of the seemingly discrepant data. Despite the fact that remains of Panpipes form a series running from perhaps the Upper Paleolithic onwards,1os the material of which their tubes were composed is almost invariably bone, as might be expected, given the perishable nature of Panpipes formed from reed- or wood- tubes lashed together. A very few Panpipes preserved from antiquity, however, have been carved from a solid slab of wood, and of these the material, wherever specified in the notices of their excavation, is always boxwood. Without exception these examples are of West European origin and Roman date, but in Vincent Megaw's informed opinion probably all the later Panpipes in this region are "due to Mediterranean influence."109 The seven-note boxwood from a second or third-century well at Alesia110 was scored with straight lines to give the usual raft-like appearance of Panpipes, so that similar instruments depicted in ancient art may also be thought to represent, sometimes, a syrinx of solid construction.

There a nine-reed version is being played by the Muse Calliope, who is identified by label.111 Certainly, then, the instrument was not thought unworthy of being placed to the lips of the Muse, when the painter of the great mixing bowl now in Florence envisioned the marriage that gods attended. IV Thus far I have wholly concentrated upon those key words that Williams singled out for supporting Apollo's claim, while in fact the innocent reader of the poem successively meets numerous other hints, largely passed over by Williams but all preparative - as I hope to show by rapid commentary - to the reading of "boxwood(s)" as diagnostic for Pan. Bearing in mind the Panpipe-playing Calliope just mentioned, we now turn back to the point in the poem where Lycidas first appears. There we find it not beneath the dignity of the Muses to shower their favor on Simichidas through the agency of a goatherd to be exposed as Pan. Nothing would be gained by denying the pastoral god admission to the Muses' high society,112 since Lycidas, whose access to them is here apparent, was a goatherd like Pan. As Gow translates, . . By the Muses' grace, we fell in with a wayfarer, a man of Cydonia and a worthy. His name was Lycidas, and a goatherd he was.

At the same time it does not exclude the old instrumental use of av'v found in the formulaic aov 08eq (0eoZs) and regularly rendered "with God's help" or the like. Here, as throughout, Theocritus' personal idiom revivifies, without superseding, tradi- tional phraseology.</page><page sequence="25">The Lycidas of Theocritus' Idyll 7 83 had found the usual Nymphs with Pan replaced by the Graces at Mesaria,"4 where the two fine reliefs depicting just this combination came to light, and had been struck by the possibilities of heightening the syncretism. On such an assumption, the Nymphs, the constant inspiration of Pan in his playing the pipes, are here portrayed as a sort of rustic Muses. I would go further and suggest that Theocritus is assigning the Nymphs, in the world of pastoral poetry he is creating, a role comparable to that of the Muses in the pantheon of the poets for whom Apollo was patron deity. The real connections between the Muses and the Nymphs, to be sure, have been much debated. Suffice it that Theocritus makes his own view clear. Already in Idyll i he had given them haunts in common, "the fair vales of the Peneius" (I.67),115 and an identical relationship to Daphnis: "whom the Muses loved, nor did the Nymphs mislike him" (I.14i). Actually, the structural parallelism in the original - "whom the Muses loved, whom the Nymphs by no means disliked"-- bespeaks alternate modes of expressing the same idea. But the crucial passage comes later in Idyll 7 itself when Simichidas asserts that the 114 Page 75, above. On Muses confounded with Graces see Anna Rist, The Poems of Theocritus (1978) 146 f. For the confusion of Nymphs with Graces we have the word of B. S. Ridgway, The Severe Style in Greek Sculpture (1970) 119, who refers to E. Schwarzenberg, Die Grazien (1966) 16, where their initial lack of differentiation is held to be implied by Socrates (Plato, Symp. 7.5). Jere Wickens has kindly drawn my attention to the similarity of the earlier of the Mesaria reliefs to the Archandros relief with Nymphs and Pan, from Mt. Parnes (Athens Nat. Mus. 1329; Herbig, n.89 above, pl. XXVII.2). For the intimate association of Nymphs and Charites at Thasos see Guide de Thasos (lEcole Franqaise d'Ath nes, 1967) 37, with figs. 12 and 104. The musical bent of the Charites appears already in the archaic cult statue of Delian Apollo who held on his hand the three Graces, one with a lyre, one with a diaulos, and the middle one with a syrinx. The testimony of Ps. Plutarch (On Music 14) on these details was accepted by Rudolf Pfeiffer in "The Image of the Delian Apollo and Apolline Ethics," JWI 15 (1952) 21 and 29-30. 115 The word choice rtLprrEa points to the south foot of Olympus, on the Pierian slopes of which the Muses were born (Hes. Theog. 53), though here it is implied that the Vales were Nymph-frequented. Puelma (n.6, above) 156, n.37 "Zur Verbindung Musen-Nymphen," sees the relevance of Idylls 1.12, 4.29, and 5.49 also. And M. L. West, Hesiod Theogony (1966) 16i ad 23, having ad 7 cited passages where the Muses are actually called nymphs, observes that KoOpam AL~g a'y&amp;OdXowo there is used again of the Muses at II. 2.598 but of nymphs at II. 6.420, Od. 6.1o5 and 9.154.

By its initial position in the verse after necessary enjambment, EW6Adv seems intended, first, to be construed simply with the preceding noun, with which it agrees in gender, number, and case; then, to be qualified by the immediately following prepositional phrase; and finally, since an adjective and a noun framing a verse of Greek are often syntactically close-knit, to be coupled with avspa. At this point I venture to resume my inquiry into the problematic Kv8wVLKV ... . vspa with the question whether "We came upon a quincewood man," meaning "a quincewood figure of a man in his prime," should not be read beneath the surface level of "a Cydonian." First among transferred uses of "man" in the OED one finds s.v. "Man": "Applied to any image or portrait of a man, or to anything bearing a resemblance to a human figure. Man of straw (fig.) ... 1636 T. Randall in Ann. Dubrencia (1877)17: They looke like yonder man of wood, that stands to bound the limits of the Parish lands."

Alexandrian poets to have mistaken the quantity of the stem vowel. But since the "apple tree" par excellence of ancient Greece was, as C. B. Gulick in the Loeb Athenaeus comments (vol. I, p. 349), the quince (which simple ptirAda most often signified), at least Theocritus may have understood Mae'a in B61te's way and so coined KvSwVLKdV. (As a pointer to the normal signification of ji?Aov, the quince formed the canting-badge on Melian coins, despite the doubts well summarized by Colin Kraay in Num. Chron. [1964] 2, n.3; see L. H. Bailey, The Standard Cyclopedia of Horticulture [1935] 2892, fig. 3325, where the natural details, including longitudinal furrows, provide sufficient inspiration for the coins' artistic stylizations.) 1xx Apollos of wood are attested, from ebony and box (Paus. 1.42.5, 6.19.16), from cedar (Pliny 13.11.53) and bay (K.

Just so, the epigrammatists of A.Pl. 58 and 146 indicate solely by the addition of AaiV'* and Aaive'a that the Bacchant and Ariadne of their couplets are statues. Though Theocritus himself specifies in his Epigram 4.2 that the figwood Priapus there described is a xoanon (OnVKwov E vpqaELSe apTLyAve~g `'6davov), the Greek poets were far more likely to omit this detail, while their translators add "(statue of)" or the like; thus Gow spells out Kat ad at Theocritus, Epigram 12.2, by "and this figure of thyself," and Mills, re T-E Iptrrmo / Kal -V KpavlWov KaTeWaVTlOV at Idyll 1.21-22 by "facing the statue of Priapos and the Nymphs of the Spring."124 In omitting -rwv' d1&amp;av and translating as "overtook" the eLpopLES of Idyll 7.11-12, however, Mills inadvertently removes any signs that the initial stimulus for this imaginary Divine Encounter was a statue or herm such as the Greek wayfarer would often meet.

Brown roles was as "companion on the way" to the solitary herdsman daily and seasonally threading the wilderness paths with his herd or his flock.125 The composer of the Homeric Hymn to Pan, instead of listing the god's cult titles, lets us see him in action, "going up and down" (twice), "threading," "climbing up," "racing through," and "blazing a trail," just in the first thirteen lines. Herbig himself records the epithets that "spielen auf die vom Gotte erhoffte wirksame Hilfe an: EVo'0s, EvOsL&amp;os, IroAtiraios Verleiher gliicklicher Reise, Wegbereiter, Geleiter.'"126 I have made no attempt to gauge the currency of these by-names, except for Ei8os- as perhaps corresponding best to &amp;kav / UOAo'v, and that only on the basis of inscriptions published or republished by Bernand from the Paneia in the Arabian desert of southern Egypt.127 Of these inscriptions some thirty address the god as "Pan de la Bonne Route," the earliest probably datable to 254 B.C. in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus or about the time of Idyll 7.128 But d'Sas regarded as poetic counterpart for 'Epp- &amp;8tos- holds further possibilities. Taken up by Hesychius, the phrase is interpreted by LSJ s.v. &amp;tos as "H. the guardian of roads and travellers, whose statues stood on the roadside." 'Epp?us, however, came to signify any pillar surmounted by a bust, human or divine, including Pan's. If, then, "a certain wayfarer" in the Idyll should correspond to the prosaic 'Epwi &amp;8tos, EVpopLES is undeniably the verb to describe Simichidas' coming upon it with his companions.'29 For this we have an exact parallel from Theocritus, at Epigram 4.2, where the poet writes, as we have seen, "thou wilt find a new-carved image of figwood." For its part alvSpa no longer serves merely to eke out a phrase with KvSWVLKo'Sl (which as ethnic required no substantive) or simply to dis- tinguish a roadside herm of Pan from Hecate 'Evod&amp;os, whose cult statue at the crossroads, of course, was standard. Rather, it brings out 125 Herbig (n.89, above), 22-24, recognized this aspect of Pan's "Dasein," though J.

Bernand, Le Paneion d'El-Kanals: les inscriptions grecques (1972) and De Koptos a Kosseir (1972). The inscriptions seemed to me worth closer study because of the allusion possibly made later in Id. 7 (113-114) to Pan in these parts: "among the farthest Aethiopians, beneath the crag of the Blemmyes." Bernand (Le Paneion, p. 32) concludes that the Pan of El-Kanais is not Theo- critus' "dieu champestre," because the former has chosen to inhabit the wadis. But this is to treat Simichidas' threatened exile of Pan too literally. 128 N.I27, above ad init., pp. 46-47, no. io. 129 Almost invariably (by my count 25 times, explicitly or by implication) when one character is said to find (edpeZv) another, on battlefield or mountaintop, in the Iliad, the latter is seated or standing in one spot.</page><page sequence="29">The Lycidas of T jeocritus' Idyll 7 87 that the god is a good "man" with the Nymphs (Muses), a ladies' man, or in Pindar's apostrophe to Pan (fr.

I may have pressed the evidence of KV3WV0wKV too far, in that actual parallels for the carving of quincewood figures fail in both the literary and the archaeological record.l32 In any event, KV&amp;oVVKdS need not point ex- clusively to the wood species of our proposed Pan-figure, seeing that aKLwVOL, provisionally applied to the reapers at Idyll 10.45, would describe their character, not their physical make-up. All the more, the fact that KVoWVLKdV at 7.11 has an -LKOS ending proper to adjectives of apparten- ance,133 rather than the -vwos suffix mainly limited to adjectives of material, offers a possible lead. Accordingly, just as "figwood" there at 10.45 makes metaphorically vivid the lazy hirelings' weakness, sq - pace Hesychius134 - "of quince-tree type" should connote the gnarled toughness, despite the diminutive stature, of Pan and of his image. To The Standard Cyclopedia of Horticulture135 "the quince tree is small, twisted and dwarf in its habit"; to W. J. Bean,136 "with crowded branches and a low quaint habit": the descriptive adjectives repeatedly match the visual aspect of the wiry little goat-god as he is known from Greek art, and surely that of the great majority of his images once to be seen in rustic shrines and by country roads.

Brown universal recipient in providing the rootstock on which a great range of scions could be grafted successfully.137 Since a wild rootstock was regularly chosen for a cultivated graft (Thphr. CP 1.6.10), the analogy with two-form Pan would be all the more precise. And it is just the wild quince that Theophrastus (HP 2.2.5) seems to have termed the "Cydo- nian," to which he says the urpov'Oov (by implication the cultivated form) reverts when grown from seed. I shall presently recur to other elements in the Aitia of Callimachus which associate that profoundly influential and roughly contemporaneous work with Idyll 7.138 Here I conclude discussion of the crucial first verses on Lycidas by comparing a feature unquestionably present in Book 3 of the Aitia (fr. I14 Pf.) and strikingly akin to the situation in our poem, wherein the catalyst for Simichidas' Encounter would be furnished by an image of Pan. For there Callimachus (?, or his persona) discovers the aition behind the bow in one hand, and the Charites in the other, of Delian Apollo by addressing questions to the articulate cult-statue itself. Though the Delian god's attributes are explained allegorically, as befits the etiological purpose of these ill-preserved elegiacs,139 their importance resembles that of Pan's attributes in the reading here advanced of Idyll 7. Similarly, the interrogation of Delian Apollo brings out both the material of his statue (xgp~aos) and the detail of his dress (?(W/ia),140 somewhat as I am proposing that Theocritus did for Pan. To resume now in translation: Nor could one that saw him have mistaken him, for beyond all he looked the goatherd. On his shoulders he wore the tawny skin of a thick-haired shaggy goat reeking of fresh rennet, and round his breast an aged tunic was girt with a broad belt; in his right hand he grasped a crooked club of wild olive. And with a quiet smile and twinkling eye he spoke to me, and laughter hung about his lip. No one could have mistaken him, yet Williams and Giangrande alike 137 Only the wild fig shares this distinction, according to Cassianus Bassus after Diophanes (first century B.c.), at Geop. 10.76.8: T4 KvsmVa Ka' TO EplVEOv iravncs avapov a~ EKtK&amp;K . . 138 N.139, below. 139 See Pfeiffer (n.

Ridgway, The Archaic Style in Greek Sculpture (1977) 23 and 55, suggests that this belt may have been seen as a specifically Apolline attribute.</page><page sequence="31">The Lycidas of Theocritus' Idyll 7 89 suppose the narrator, in his mortal ignorance or juvenile folly, incapable of seeing through the trappings of Lycidas to his essence.141 Sometimes this conclusion has been reached by scholars aware that Theocritus' words are drawn almost formulaicly from Homeric epiphanies, in each of which the god is recognized quite correctly.x42 There are many other echoes, in succeeding verses, of the Divine Encounter conventions. They are often noted, only to be discounted on the theory that, as Giangrande puts it in extreme terms, Theocritus is composing a sophisticated Hellenistic travesty of the old topos of the Poet's Consecration. But if the growing insight that wit and high seriousness may coexist in Callimachusl43 is extended to the present passage, the merry laughter of Lycidas rings out as before, recurring leitmotif-fashion at lines 42 and 128, but without the undertones of mockery and even contempt that have been read into it.x44 Theocritus' phrasing of this mirth corresponds remarkably to Pindar's description of another great hybrid being of Greek myth, teacher of gods and heroes, the Centaur Chiron. In Pythian 9 (38-39) the Centaur reacts to his young pupil Apollo by "laughing indulgently with gentle gaze," as E. D. Francis has sensitively rendered the Pindaric dyava XAapov yEAdoat dp'opi'.145 Where Pythian 9 has XAap`v, Idyll 7 puts it that Lycidas spoke d&amp;rplas . .. orapws (first at verse 19), "fixedly baring his teeth" or "grinning steadily." ZEaapd; can be used of man or beast, expressing emotion in various ways from fawning to snarling. But it is especially appropriate to the caprine Pan, KCov of the goddess. This phrase is thus no warrant for those seeking a cruelly satirical drift in the goatherd's actually indulgent remarks to "the city-bred poet." Rather, it accurately describes the frequent portrayals of Pan, in ancient art, with lips permanently parted in a toothy grin.146 That was, after all, his birthright possession. The Homeric Hymn to Pan characterizes the god, "who from his birth was marvellous to 141 Williams (n.9, above) pp. 138 and 142; Giuseppe Giangrande, "Theocrite, Simichidas et les Thalysies," Ant.

For a just account of the relevant Homeric passages see Luck (n.8, above) 187 f. 143 See Douglass Parker's words of thoughtful protest in CW 57 (1964) 358. 144 This demeanor of the god in epiphany, instead of betraying his amusement at not being recognized (so Williams [n.9, above] 144), may rather reveal - here as well as in Puelma's examples (n.6, above) 149 and in Luck's (n.8, above) 188 - a wish, natural in the circumstances, to reassure the mortal encountered. 145 In CP 67 (1972) 288. 146 Cf. the description by Bernard Ashmole, in JHS 87 (1967) 4, of the Pan- head on the Rubens vase in Baltimore: "The face takes its characteristic features . . . from a goat - the narrow, wrinkled muzzle, the prominent incisor teeth, and the lips slanting sharply up from the centre."</page><page sequence="32">90 Edwin L.

The exceptional character of the dual expression here of the goat's shagginess is indicated by the fact that this verse alone is listed in Gow's Index s.v. "adjectives, synonymous together," and though Gow (n.27, above, p. 136) cites two other hexameters in which one adjective is held merely to reinforce the other, in both cases one of the words in question is odso, rashly taken as a synonym for "swift." In these circumstances it is worth asking whether the sympathetic reader, by now E7&amp;aUKO7rWV, would not hear SaauvrpVXos as an epithet of Pan and construe it with adjacent EtXE; both words in turn are framed by Aaoloto .. .rpayoto (themselves being, with EK, verse-initial, -central, and -final), whose identical endings support their natural linkage and their grammatical separation from Saai7PLXos. The form aau'ptLXos, of course, can certainly serve as the genitive of Saauv'OpS in a given context, but it was perhaps incautious of Gow (n. 27, above, p. 172), weighing 7rvpporp~Xw at Id. 8.3, to make anything of the fact that "T. uses forms in -Opt6," when there exist but three sure instances, even counting Saut'rpxos.

Servius, at Aeneid 8.282, observes that the Salian priests were sheep-and-goatskin- clad in imitation of Pan, and whatever the truth of the matter, the explanation was anyhow expected to gain credence from the reader's mental image of the god. The artistic likenesses of Pan are apt to be too sketchily rendered, and museum-guide descriptions of Pan too cursory, to allow certainty on this point, but the claws and head-form on the animal-skin cloak are sometimes obviously feline, while at other times the hooves and head are clearly caprine. Gilbert Lawall, in a keen obser- vation that may have helped kindle my own thoughts on Lycidas, remarks the constancy of the goatskin fastened about the shoulders as an attribute of Satyrs.151 The point is just, but we need to recall, too, the conclusion of Brommer (whose acquaintance with Satyr- and Pan- representations alike is unsurpassed) that the originally distinct type for these two quite separate beings soon began to be conflated.152 During the fourth century B.C. the most fully draped major statue of Pan, which survives in half a dozen copies, was created. It is called from its great animal-skin cloak the "Pan muffled up."153 This work, to judge from its later popularity, might have been known to Theocritus and have served as partial inspiration; it still does not account for the two remaining items of dress, arrirho and owa 'p. The only other place where Theocritus combines "tunic"154 and "belt," as Gow here translates, is a passage (Id. 26.17) depicting mountain-roaming maenads.

Konstan in CP 74 (1979) 233 f, who finds Theocritus at Id. 18.57 employing E;lOp&amp; in elaborate wordplay to achieve a deliberate confusion of Menelaus with Chanti- cleer. For Pan the epithet is the more apposite as heightened sexuality has been inferred from hairiness according to both Greek philosophers and modern psychologists; see, e.g., Arist. GA 744b1 and T. H.

Brown imagine the alpine huntsman Pan as girded somewhat like Artemis in the chase! But in a curious way this article of Lycidas' clothing symboli- cally links him to another goddess, she who presides over the scene of the Harvest Home (7.131-157). Only for an instant is the Feast of Demeter introduced into the poem's central dialogue, at line 32, where the goddess is distinguished by the epithet E'TE7TAOS, a compound found here only in Theocritus. By means of this attribute in common, I submit, the poet deftly associates the Mistress of the Sown with the Daimon of the Steppe, the Great Goddess (here, as at Euripides' Helen I30I-68,155 identified with Demeter) with her Boon Companion Pan. In the process, Theocritus also unites, in a way so far unremarked, the poem's centerpiece and frame.156 For the rest, the stench of fresh rennet from Lycidas' cloak piquantly furnishes an odor of sanctity, albeit ranker than that which usually betrays a god's presence among mortals.s57 And concerning the "crooked club of wild olive," both by the precision with which we are told about this Kop'va, and by its final position among the items of dress and equipage, it should be the critically informative attribute. Theocritus once repeats the term by having Lycidas promise, "I will present you with this Koptva" (43), only to end by giving a Aaywf3dAov (128): "He bestowed on me his throwing stick."158 This word denotes a short club used as a missile by hunters and herders to help drive cattle or to fling at hares. Rosenmeyer's sentences on the usual Pan-type begin with sound instruction: "The vases show us that from the beginning he was a herdsman's god. Often he carries a lagobolon."159 Already in the fourth century it appears among Pan's most characteristic attributes, repeatedly on coin issues of the Arcadian 155 On the syncretism seen in this ode, A. M. Dale, Euripides: Helen (1967) 147 ad loc., and Koster, whom she cites, in Meded. Ned. Ak. van Wet., Afd. Letterk. 25 (1962) 215-237. 156 Charles Segal, however, has noted in a review (CJ 63 [1968] 228) that Demeter (a&amp; S yEcAduao) at verse 156 "balances" Lycidas (&amp;dS yEAdcaas). And though he deals (n. 79, below, p. 40) with their peploi in terms of contrast, we both regard the diction applied to goatherd and goddess alike as ranging them on a common plane of existence. 157 See E. Lohmeyer, Vom g6ttlichen Wohlgeruch (SB Heidelb., phil.-hist. K1. Io, 9 [1919] 4 if, a citation for which I am indebted to Luck (n.8, above) 188 n.8; cf. S.

But midday is just the time that is still regarded in rural Greece as belonging to the Neraidhes and Pan. At this Dangerous Hour, to be sure, one must beware of disturbing the god, but Pan was also reputed to send dreams in a Mediterranean siesta, and waking visions as well.163 Lycidas contents himself with questions about Simichidas' business abroad at midday, simply addressing him by name (21-26), while Simichidas replies, AvK18a 17tAE and so on, "Friend Lycidas..." (27-41). It is usually said that these greetings, straight off without introductions on both sides, represent mere literary convention, or else the two are old acquaintances. Yet neither explanation need hold true if Lycidas is understood as Pan discovered. Hesiod recognized the Muses in his renowned Encounter with divinity. Moreover, Simichidas' greeting is not too familiar to direct toward the unpretentious goat god. We have only to recall Socrates' simply phrased prayer to Pan before his image, at the end of the Phaedrus (279b): ~Q~ lAE Hciv, it began, with just the term of affection addressed to Lycidas.164 160 Their verso, featuring a beardless young Pan, is well illustrated in R. T. Williams, The Confederate Coinage of the Arcadians in the Fifth Century B.C. (1965). 161 Ibid., p. 336, n.33. The shepherd's "crook," another sort of implement, is misleading: see R. Hampe's note on the "Wurfholz," in Gymnasium 68 (1961) 556. 162 At Id. 4.49, to be sure, a neatherd wishes he had a throwing-stick with which to whack an errant calf, but apparently he doesn't - and it looks very much as if Theocritus has deliberately restricted the AayoflAov to Lycidas, again to distinguish him from other herdsmen. 16s For the lore to which this paragraph does scant justice see, besides Id. I.15, R. H. and E. Blum, The Dangerous Hour (1970) 328 f, 331 f; Cameron (n.7, above) 301 f, Rosenmeyer (n.91, above) 88 f; H: J. Rose, A Handbook of Greek Mythology (1958) 178, n.9; and J. B. Friedman, "Euridice, Heurodis, and the Noon-Day Demon," in Speculum 41 (1966) 28, with earlier literature listed in these works. 164 Simichidas himself, speaking in propria persona in his forthcoming song, will be heard to invoke the god, "' H7&amp;v (Av . .. ."

Class. 3 (1968-70) 279-284, and Diskin Clay in Arktouros, Hellenic Studies Presented to Bernard M. W. Knox (1979) 345-353. Clay demonstrates that Pan's presence makes itself felt throughout the Phaedrus, and observes that it is Socrates, the stranger</page><page sequence="36">94 Edwin L. Brown Even Socrates permitted himself to ask a favor, and so does Simichidas now: 'All men say that among the herdsmen and the reapers165 thou art by far the best of pipers, and much it glads my heart to hear; and yet, in my thought, I fancy myself thy equal ... But come; the way and the dayle6 are thine and mine to share; let us make country song; and each, maybe, shall profit the other.' Do ut des is good old doctrine. Giangrande is duly appalled at the idea that Simichidas would dare put himself on a plane with a god by pro- to the countryside, who was most "sensitive to the divinities that haunt the Ilissos"; just so, it is city-bred Simichidas who enjoys a world of discourse held in common with the goatherd. Not Plato alone before Ficino, as Clay would have it (p. 347, n.7), but also Theocritus presents a Pan "somehow concerned with Adyos," if that demonic being stands behind Lycidas. 165 I would hold that Ev iJparipEaor, meaning "in the reapers' esteem," does not correspond to uE'o~0~oS in the phrase "alone of all the heroes" at Id. i8.i8. There the prepositional phrase appears in place of the more usual genitive of the divided whole, while here 'v with the dative tells in whose judgment Lycidas is pre-eminent among syrinx players. Simichidas, of course, equally calls Lycidas first in the esteem of herdsmen, but a translation that makes the goat- herd cum Pan a herdsman does not raise difficulties, as making him a reaper does. Some indication how reapers might convincingly rank as judges of syrinx- playing appears in another Theocritean verse: at Id. o0.16 the reapers are said to work in time to Polybota's tune, and the verb that describes her piping (rorav'EL) need not be limited to aulos music, as LSJ recognize s.v. aAEw II (for Luc.

Just afterwards, he adds what is admitted to be a rather precisely modest remark,168 "All call me the best of singers, but ... in my own esteem I am as yet no match in song either for the great Sicelidas from Samos or for Philitas, but vie with them like a frog against grasshoppers." In light of this kind of diffidence, I prefer to think laoo~apblELw regularly overtranslated, as if this was to be an amoebic context like those in other Idylls, where challenges and counter- challenges are issued, where mutual stakes are settled on, and victor and vanquished declared. To continue in translation: "So, with a purpose, did I say; and with a pleasant laugh the goatherd answered . . . 'I will give thee my stick, for thou art a sapling whom Zeus has fashioned all for truth.' " Here the goatherd's phrasing of his motive may remind some of the Muses' words as they consecrated Hesiod to poetry. But when high seriousness most abounds, then wit in Hellenistic times is seldom far away.

Now a pun, even a Pan pun, must make a kind of outrageous sense, the import here being that Simichidas is a Pan incarnate and so deserves the emblem of the musical daimon who stays close to the perennial springs of inspiration.170 But Theocritus, having here come as close to stating the terms of his artistic being as he ever does, now repeats his manifesto as the personal viewpoint of our Lycidas and thus wryly confers a divine sanction upon it: "For much I hate the builder who seeks to raise his house as high as the peak of Mount Oromedon, and much those cocks of the Muses who lose their toil with crowing against the bard of Chios." Others have well interpreted the larger import of these strictures against those who would out-Homer Homer;171 but on one point I am obliged to comment, because Williams saw it as an additional string in Apollo's bow.172 He argued that Horomedon was the mountain that loomed to the south of our hikers, and that a sacrificial calendar'73 169 As Plato had Socrates assert, "Even the gods like a joke" (Crat. 407c). For more on Theocritus' wordplay and Lycidas' irony here, see Charles Segal, "Simichidas' Modesty: Theocritus, Idyll 7.44," AJP 95 (1974) 128-13I. 170 Being of the spiritual lineage of Pan, Simichidas would appropriately be dubbed "offspring of the snubnosed one." Pan was portrayed with the pug nose befitting a goat god, as inter alia the coins of Panticapaeum, which have a splendid Pan's head (with the ivy wreath of a poet!) as their canting-badge, attest: e.g., Kraay / Hirmer, Greek Coins (1966) pl. XV. 2ZLos, further, is known to have been a satyr name (LSJ s.v. and BCH 91 [1967]). But the only earlier instance of the diminutive "Simich-" in literature appears in "Simiche" (as editors - including Gomme and Sandbach, Menander: A Commentary [19731 132 and 743 - usually render her name), who figures in that festal work of the young playwright, his still recently retrieved Dyskolos. This comedy has for presiding genius a Pan near akin to Lycidas as I see him here. (Besides the commentaries see P. Photiades, "Pan's Prologue to the Dyskolos of Menander," G &amp; R 5 [1958] io8-z22, especially her remarks on Pan as a god there of rustic merriment, of mystery and enchantment, of moderation and generosity.) It evokes an atmosphere redolent of the goat god's Phylasian haunts, an atmosphere that the creator of pastoral must have savored and imbibed. Without denying the satyric resonances of "Simichidas," then, one may wonder whether famili- arity with the Old Woman's name, appearing thrice (636, 926, 931) in the text, did not also prompt Theocritus to adopt the name. 171 Tellingly enough by Gow himself (n.27, above) 144, even without anticipat- ing the sudden relevance that Lycidas' identification as the divine patron of bucolic poetry lends these words. 172 N.9, above, pp. 142-143. 173 The document, discovered by J. Zarraftis, was published by Herzog (n.72, above) 14-19.</page><page sequence="39">The Lycidas of Theocritus' Idyll 7 97 found on Cos attests a cult of Apollo Horomedon. Accordingly, Apollo has special rights over the mountain just as he has over poetry, and the builder who tries to raise a house as high as its peaks incurs the goat- herd's hatred because the mountain is sacred to Apollo. With this reading I should have no quarrel if only the goatherd's hatred were understood to signify Pan's hostility, not Apollo's. For, as a honer of ditties (pEAv'8ptov tE6rTOvacra (51)), Pan might well be opposed to the pretentious moderns who were affecting to compose epic on the scale of Apolline Homer. In one other phrase where Williams saw significant geographical allusion I find his interpretation wholly felicitous in principle. When Simichidas asserts (7.93) that the fame of his poetic pieces may have carried even to the throne of Zeus, Gow, like others, adopts the view that "some great person is meant, who on Cos can hardly be other than Ptolemy Philadelphus."174 But the alleged comparison of Ptolemy to Zeus at Idyll 17.I31 is no real parallel, and Williams proposes instead that the "throne of Zeus" means one of the twin peaks of Mt. Horome- don. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that any part of this massif was sacred to Zeus.175 But Herzog long ago noticed that the modern name for the mountain at the remote western tip of Cos is Zini, as if from ancient Zlvt'ov.176 Not only does this form agree with that universally used for Zeus on Cos till Koine times, but it would help explain why Theocritus here employs Zqvo's, the alternative form of Zeus in the genitive, instead of Ald', as at 7.44. Finally, if I may be permitted a personal observation after visiting Pan's Coan haunts, the god's great cave that Doro Levi excavated177 is set high on the southern slope of Mt. Zini, whose peak is quite as thronelike as other mountaintops known to have been called the "Throne of Zeus."'178 V With these topographical notes I have completed what is intended as a nearly comprehensive account of Idyll 7's centerpiece insofar as it 174 N.27, above, p. 155. 175 The inscription (no. 5A, line 2o, in Herzog [n.72, above] x6 f) on which this proposal must chiefly depend actually mentions Zeus' mountain only by dint of restoration: &amp;rv 7t [T70 Zqvc]YJ pE. The article o00 is unexpected here, where, moreover, ['ArrdMoAvo]. fits the lacuna better. 176 Ibid., p. 54- 177 N.76, above. 178s A. B. Cook devoted a long section of his vast thesaurus (Zeus I [19141 124-148) expressly to "The mountain as the Throne of Zeus." For the modern designation of the northern peak of Olympus as "Throne of Zeus" see Johanna Schmidt in R.E. 35 (1939) s.v. "Olympos," col. 267, 11. 51-59.</page><page sequence="40">98 Edwin L. Brown records an Encounter between Simichidas as Theocritus' poetic persona and Lycidas as Pan consecrating him to bucolic poetry. The reservation must be added, of course, because the songs that the two exchange ideally should reflect the identity of each "composer," yet to interpret them fully would mean to risk seriously overburdening an already lengthy essay. Fortunately, Charles Segal's "Theocritus' Seventh Idyll and Lycidas"'79 and K. J. McKay's "Pomp and Pastoralia in Theokritos' Idyll 7"180 have recently and complementarily characterized the two songs afresh, building on earlier scholars' work but offering much in the way of perceptive new analysis. In general I should be well content to adhere to Segal's view of the first song ("Through the magic of poetry, mythology, and that mysterious calm which he possesses from his first appearance ... Lycidas sets his love into a larger setting") as against the second ("Simichidas addresses the conventional figures of the Erotes to curse another. With &lt;an) idealized pastoral scene Lycidas ends; Simichidas goes on to an urban setting of house doors . . . and the bit of social realism in the old hag and superstitious practices" [p. 52]. "His allusions to Pan are learned and literary ... and he teases the god with playfully exaggerated threats" [p. 541). But I am obliged to offer at least some indication how I would handle certain details of the songs, those for which the identity of Lycidas as Pan might seem problematic. No more obstacle, naturally, is posed by Simichidas' jocular181 threats against Pan182 in his song (7.I o9-114) than is raised for Williams by the reference to Apollo earlier in the same song (ioo-ioi). The piquant situational humor is merely transferred to Simichidas' invocation of my proposed deity behind Lycidas. Pan would relish the joke, and so Lycidas is described, c6S yEAdacrras / 9 rrdpos (128-129). Lycidas' own song, further, lends itself to utterance by Pan as readily as by Apollo. If the opening verses on Ageanax's voyage to Mitylene is interpreted literally as showing a relationship to the sea on Lycidas' part beyond that of any ordinary rustic, Apollo's claims as a marine deity could undoubtedly meet this test; but neither are Pan's links with the sea - and his importance in the eyes of sailors and fishers - negli- gible, as his epithet at Idyll 5.14 ('KT7-os) suggests.183 As for the amorous 179 Weiner Studien N.F. 8 (1974) esp. 45-58. 180 AUMLA no. 44 (1975) esp. 184-186. 181 So expressed in Bruno Snell, The Discovery of the Mind, transl.

But closer inspection reveals that this verse forms the center of a seven-line snatch of song carefully set off by WL taKapLut-Er Kot?raa... (83) and ... OcEZ Kotdira (89). In short, these vocatives frame no mere comment by Lycidas on the song of Tityrus, whose participation by singing at Lycidas' feast is foretold by the prospective master of ceremonies in his own song (72-82). Rather, they and the verses set off by them would in modern punctuation be enclosed by single quotation marks to show that they form part of Tityrus's song. Elsewhere too, at Idyll 4.32 and 14.30,188 Theocritus introduces excerpts from a song, but never elsewhere with such elaborate symmetry, metrical as well as verbal. Here, it was as important for Theocritus, lacking more recent resources of orthography, to make clear whom verses 83-89 should be attributed to as it was for Hesiod at Works and Days 209-2I I, when he employed similar devices to separate himself from the words of the hawk to the nightingale.189 For on Theocritus' success at this point might hinge the chances that his discerning readers would recognize Lycidas for the immortal goatherd that I believe the poet intended.190 THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL 188 See Gow (n.27, above), 84 ad 4.32; Dover (n.i, above), 192 ad 14.30. 189 K.
