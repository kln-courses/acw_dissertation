<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aurignacian signs, pendants and art objects in Central and Eastern Europe Joachim Hahn The Aurignacian industries of central and eastern Europe are the earliest Upper Palaeo- lithic industries to have yielded a large number of signs, pendants and art objects. From the partially earlier, partially contemporaneous Szeletian, the only art object so far known comes from Lovas, a paint mine in Hungary (Meszaros and Vertes 1955). It is the aim of this article to describe the different forms of signs, pendants and art objects, to analyse their geographical distribution and to compare them with their Gravettian counterparts. The study has been conducted by a conventional, comparative 'culture-historical' method in the sense that no measurements or counts were undertaken, although this technique can be applied to the signs. Equally, no microscopic analysis, such as the one by Marshack (1970), was employed. In the following pages, a brief discussion of the Aurignacian sequence in central and eastern Europe introduces this study. i The Aurignacian industries in central and eastern Europe In central and eastern Europe, the Aurignacian industries are for the most part repre- sented by small, poor assemblages as compared to the French Aurignacian. In the vast region considered here, hardly more than 00oo assemblages can be attributed to the Aurignacian. Usually, the harsher climatic conditions of the last glaciation, which allowed only small populations to live in this region, are supposed to be responsible for this. As has been shown recently, the maximum of the Wiirm glaciation was not reached before 25,000 B.P., the maximum advance of glaciers not lasting for more than a few thousand years. The formerly distinguished 'Wiirm I/2'- and 'Wiirm 2/3'- interstadials of central Europe are now allotted to four more or less developed oscillations: Tursac (at approx. 23,000 B.P. after the C14 dates) Denekamp (from 32,000 to 29,000 B.P.) Hengelo (from 39,000 to 37,000 B.P.) Moershoofd (at approx. 45,000 B.P.) These interstadials, which are the middle ones of the eleven oscillations in the last glaciation, are represented at Konigsaue and the Geisel valley in the D.D.R. (Mania 1970). In the loess and cave sediments they are usually only partially preserved. Soli-</page><page sequence="2">Aurignacian signs, pendants and art objects in Central and Eastern Europe 253 fluction and cryoturbation probably occurred as a rule in the humid-cold transitional phases after the interstadials. In central Europe, they were accentuated after the Denekamp-interstadial, disturbing or eroding many layers. The sediments containing Aurignacian artefacts were mostly affected by them, as they had been sedimented only a short time earlier. It is possible, but not yet proven, that the first true Aurignacian industries appeared at the end of the Hengelo-interstadial. The majority of the Aurignacian assemblages seem to belong in the solifluction phase shortly after Hengelo(?) and in the following phase of loess sedimentation. It is probable that the Aurignacian lasts into the Denekamp- interstadial. The relatively few C14 dates for the Aurignacian in central Europe lie between 35,000 and 30,000 B.P., but the earliest dates for Istall6sk6 of 40,000 and 45,000 B.P. (Gabori-Csank I970) are not considered as reliable. The main characteristics of the stone and bone-tool assemblages have been described elsewhere (Hahn I97oa). A point that has to be emphasized is that they seem to suggest small local units within the overall Aurignacian complex. This can be seen also in the frequency of the tool types defined according to the Sonneville-Bordes type concept. It is interesting to note that the regional differences are at least as strong as the temporal ones, and this is also reflected in art. Of the approximately ioo Aurignacian assemblages from central and eastern Europe, twenty-five have yielded signs, pendants and art objects (fig. 6), fifteen being assemblages from caves and ten from open-air sites. z Signs In the Aurignacian period a great variety of signs are present, not only on art objects and pendants, but also on projectile points, polishers, awls and simple bone fragments. In accordance with their position on the objects, three categories are established: I signs on the edge 2 signs on the surface 3 signs on perforations The distinction between signs on the edge or on the surface is not always easy and requires a special discussion. Signs on the edge The part of the object with the smallest dimension is defined as the edge, a term applic- able to polishers and some projectile points, but not to objects with round cross-sections. With regard to the fragmentary round-sectioned ivory objects, an artificial plane can be taken parallel to the lamellar structure of the ivory. The following classes of signs are distinguished on the edge: 1.I convex-concave, S-like outline (fig. 7:19) 1.2 fine vertical parallel incisions (fig. 7:20) 1.3 deeply engraved, vertical parallel incisions (fig. 7:I8)</page><page sequence="3">~ ,,: ~.~~~~~~~~~~~-?~.- -.-:~ . l .*o4 ffly If I S e , 'z-~~ 23 _. =' _ nu-a _-*o-rC&gt;,&lt;:, C y "- -.--.~ A*---4g- VVV .-- ?

They con- sist of deeply engraved lines around the hole. 3.1 oblique circulating incisions (fig. 7:x8) The more frequent types of perforation, those with unmodified walls, are not taken into account here. Regional distribution of signs The fifteen differentiated signs are displayed in figure 9. The assemblages are roughly arranged from west to east. The main classes of objects on which the signs are to found are expressed through symbols. Each symbol represents one object; an object having more than one sign is represented by several symbols. Of the Ioo Aurignacian assemblages twenty-one have yielded signs. The special position of the two Vogelherd assemblages (nos 5 and 6) is shown on figure 9. Vogelherd V contains at least one example of every sign known and Vogelherd IV, twelve of the total of fifteen signs. With this continuous representation, these two assemblages clearly stand out from all the others of which only one, Muralovka (24), contains as many as four different signs. On the average, all the other assemblages have only two different signs apiece. The cause of the great diversity of signs in the Vogelherd assemblages is not known. Judging from the number of stone tools, these two assemblages belong to the richest in the region considered. One should, however, take into consideration the fact that the two layers distinguished by Riek (I934) do not correspond to settlement phases. The overlying hearths indicate four to five living floors, which were partially disturbed and probably not developed everywhere in the cave. Another cause for the high frequency could be the large number of art objects. Although this would affect the sample size since many signs occur on art objects, only a few signs are actually restricted to these objects - the rest occurring on normal tools also. The convex-concave edge (I.I) is limited to Vogelherd V, where it occurs on three different objects: on an ivory projectile point, a piece of worked bone (fig. 7:19) and a perforated ivory object (baton de commandement). No parallels are known for this special sort of edge treatment. The incised perforation, too, is restricted to the Vogelherd assemblages. It is found on a half-moon-shaped ivory pendant from layer V and a perforated ivory object from layer IV (fig. 7:I8) and layer V. Incised perforations are perhaps a horizon style of the Aurignacian because they occur also on perforated antler objects of the French Aurignacian. One perforated antler object, with oblique incisions, is known from Le Poisson, and several examples come from the rock shelters of Castanet and Blanchard (Sonneville-Bordes I967: plates 57-8), the latter having screw-like incisions. The last type of sign to occur only in the Vogelherd assemblages, consists of parallel convex incisions. This sign is found on an ivory statuette from layer V (plate 8:2) and a perforated ivory object from layer IV (fig. 7: 8). All the other signs are represented in at least one other example from the other assemblages. Edge signs are the most numer- ous signs. The next most numerous signs are fine horizontal surface incisions, which are found on different kinds of tools in seven assemblages.

The Vogelherd irregular engravings (fig. 8:i) on ivory fragments could well have come from a once com- plete mammoth tusk. The existence of such themes on large objects is proven by a frag- mentary diaphysis from Vogelherd V. The design is separated into two parts by a line of deep incisions. On one half, both ends show long oblique incisions at an acute angle to one another. In the centre are many fine, partially cross-cutting incisions, the meaning of which - if there is any - has not yet been established. On the other half, too, there is a like concentration of fine incisions surrounded by V-like signs forming an irregular oval. An analysis of this object is now being prepared by the author. In Lower Austria, the two open-air sites of Langmannersdorf and GroBweikersdorf have also yielded irregular engravings. From GroBweikersdorf comes an unpublished stone plaquette, and from Langmannersdorf a sandstone pebble with irregular incisions on the surface and oblique lines on the edges (fig. 8:2) and a fragmentary chalk pebble with a few long, deeply engraved incisions (fig. 8:3). Of the other signs, the rows of points occur in both layers of the Vogelherd on animal statuettes (plate 8:3, 6-8). The only other occurrence is Kostenki I, 3 (Rogacev I957), where four rows of points form a rectangular pattern on an ivory fragment. This sign is found in the French Aurignacian, too, in the rock-shelters of Blanchard and Lartet (Sonneville-Bordes I967: plate 52; Marshack I970: figs 2, 5) and at Saint-Jean-de-Verges (V6zian I966: figs 14, 9) on an ivory pendant. The X-like signs are found in the two Vogelherd layers, in the G6pfelstein cave and possibly at Willendorf II, 4 (Felgenhauer I956-9). At Vogelherd, there seems to be a development through time of this sign. The Vogelherd V assemblage has only single Xs (fig. 7:19) or rows of Xs (plate 8: ). The upper layer IV has overlapping X-signs found on an animal statuette (plate 8:8), an antler projectile point and on both faces of a worked piece of bone. There are single X-signs on a bone fragment from the G6pfelstein cave and on a badly-preserved bone fragment from Willendorf II, 4, the latter probably of the overlapping type. These signs, with the possible exception of the X-signs, are present in the French Aurignacian also. The signs occur as well in the ensuing Gravettian, but are joined by new more complex examples (Abramova I970: fig. 6; Kozlowski I970: fig. 3). In the Gravettian, Kozlowski discerns two regional and temporal styles: the styles of Pavlov and Kostenki (I970: 45-6). This is possible, since there is a larger sample of signs and sites from which one can draw conclusions about stylistic patterns. 3 Pendants By 'pendants' we mean perforated objects whose relatively small size presupposes a use as suspension ornaments or clothing trimming. This category also includes notched objects and fossil molluscs with partially natural holes. Seven different sorts of pendants occur in Aurignacian industries: i miscellaneous pendants</page><page sequence="9">260 Joachim Hahn 2 tooth pendants (excluding fox canines) 3 stone beads 4 round ivory beads 5 fox canines 6 dentalia 7 miscellaneous molluscs The miscellaneous pendants consist of unique pieces. They include: a ring-like, notched stone pendant from Bockstein-Torle (fig. 7:6); a big half-moon-shaped ivory pendant with two notched perforations from Vogelherd V; a perforated horse patella with a half-relief carving of a mammoth from Vogelherd IV; and a perforated rib epiphysis from Mladec, in Moravia. The second category (tooth pendants) comprises different perforated, or notched, teeth such as canines of cave bear, wolf and an unidentifiable tooth root (fig. 7:15). The last is not discussed separately as it is the only piece in the region considered. Stone beads (the third category) are present in only three assemblages: Bockstein- T6rle (fig. 7:3-5), Wildscheuer III (fig. 7:I-2) and Krems-Hundssteig. The stone beads from Bockstein-Torle and Wildscheuer have a thinned upper part in order to facilitate perforation; one example from Bockstein-Torle has an unfinished perforation (fig. 7:4). The ivory pendants (the fourth category), all of which have a thinned upper part, take the following forms: (i) round (fig. 7:7), (2) oval (fig. 7:8), (3) elongated (fig. 7:14) and (4) elongated with a thickened end (fig. 7:17) and an unfinished perforation. The fifth category consists of perforated fox canines, belonging either to Alopex lagopus, Vulpes vulpes or Vulpes corsak. The perforation of the examples from Hohlen- stein is usually small (fig. 7:9-Io); the perforation of the pieces from Breitenbach was made in the central part of the root (fig. 7:I2-I3). Only the perforated canine of Vulpes corsak from Muralovka (fig. 7:1 I) has been flattened on both sides to facilitate perforation. The dentalia usually occur in bigger numbers on the open-air sites, mainly in Lower Austria. The last category comprises all the other molluscs which in most cases have a hole, the artificial character of which is not always certain (Papp 1956-9: I29). Like the signs, the pendants are arranged on a chart (fig. o) which displays the geographical distribution from west to east. The diagram seems to show two distinct groupings. With the exception of Breitenbach, the first group consists of cave sites, whereas the second group, with the exception of Sjuren I, 4, a rock-shelter on the Crimean peninsula, comprises open-air sites. Of the first group, the two Vogelherd assemblages have yielded only three pendants, which is a surprisingly low number considering the richness of the other material. It is probable that the smaller pendants, although present, were not recovered during the excavation. The only site with numerous pendants is Mladec, but the homogeneity of the assemblage is uncertain. The stone beads, present in only three series, have numerous counterparts in the French Aurignacian (cf. Castanet; Sonneville-Bordes I967: fig. 53). The second group is characterized by molluscs. Their presence is probably due to the better excavation techniques applied to open-air sites. With the exception of the raw material of the stone artefacts and certain minerals, the molluscs are the only means of establishing the zones of contact.

The molluscs originated partially in the surrounding region, from the Balaton lake in Hungary and from the coast of the Mediterranean (or Black?) Sea. The dentalia of Langmannersdorf and Senftenberg come from the southern Vienna basin. At Kostenki I, on the Don, the molluscs found in layer 3 are known today only on the Black Sea coast. The relatively high number of molluscs on these sites seems to indicate an intentional gathering, and possibly even long-distance exchange systems linking local traditions which are reflected in the stone and bone-tool assemblages. 4 Art objects Only four assemblages have yielded art objects (fig. 6): the two layers of Vogelherd,</page><page sequence="11">262 Joachim Hahn Hohlenstein-Stadel (Hahn i97ob) and Muralovka, on the Black Sea coast (Praslov and Filippov I967). Animal representations Aurignacian animal representations are restricted to the Vogelherd assemblages. They consist mainly of round sculptures made from mammoth ivory, with one low relief on a horse patella. The six statuettes of Vogelherd V include the following types of animal: 2 mammoths, i horse, i cervid, i felid and x bear(?). Only one mammoth sculpture is well preserved (plate 8 :). This representation renders all the details of a mammoth with the exception of the tusks. The surface is covered with X-signs arranged in rows. Only the back part of the second mammoth is preserved. Originally this was probably the biggest of the Vogelherd statuettes, with a height of 3 in. Its surface also is covered with signs - in this case, rows of short horizontal engravings. A badly-fragmented ivory statuette, fragments of which came from both layers V and IV, may possibly represent a deer (plate 8:2). This identification is implied by the small extremities and the form of the buttocks. Riek supposed that the head had been deliber- ately cut off (1934: 286), as some of the signs were applied after the head was removed. The body of this animal is covered with signs: on the fore legs, vertical incisions; on the hind legs, horizontal ones; on the trunk, two series of convex incisions under which are two series of short and of long oblique incised lines; and finally, on the back, a row of points and one of short incisions. A similarly fragmented felid has a long body and neck (plate 8:3), the muscles of the legs are well developed and the legs themselves are represented separately. The eyes are rendered by triangular incisions, the triangular ears lie back upon the head. On the neck, the felid has a row of deep incisions and on the belly three incised lines. The surface of the body is covered by several rows of points. A longitudinally fractured animal statuette probably belongs to a bear (plate 8:5), This identification is suggested by the strong muscles of the extremities, the well formed withers, the short tail and the conical head. With the exception of the strong muscles, there are no other surface details except for some signs. These include three incised lines between head and withers and a long vertical incision in the middle of the trunk. The upper layer of the Vogelherd site (IV) has yielded three animal representations. One animal is a bovid (plate 8:6), with a short massive trunk and prominent withers. The withers and the back have deeply incised lines, a row of incisions on the fore leg and several rows of points on the trunk. Another animal representation displays a rich variety of surface details (plate 8:8). It is not possible to determine if this object represents a felid or a young rhinoceros. The latter is perhaps more probable if the animal is contrasted with the felid from layer V (plate 8:3). The following features would support such an identification: the massive body with hanging belly, the fat on the throat, and the long pointed ears. The absence of a horn is not decisive, as a young animal would be without a horn. The lowered head has an incised muzzle, and eyes are formed by small holes. The trunk is covered by signs: on the throat, a V-sign; on the shoulder, back and legs, horizontal or vertical incisions; and on the belly, a cross-cutting X-field. The last had traces of red ochre.</page><page sequence="12">Aurignacian signs, pendants and art objects in Central and Eastern Europe 263 On the horse patella, a mammoth had been carved in bas-relief. This also preserves traces of red colouring. The presence of a broken perforation suggests that this art object was a pendant. The mammoth on it has a strongly curved head. The neck and the withers are not represented, because the sloping back had to fit in the oval outline of the patella. The vertical legs are massive, the trunk is bent to the fore legs, and no tusks are figured. The latter two details were observed also on the mammoth figures from layer V. On the body are three oblique incised lines. Human representations Whereas animal figures are found only in both Vogelherd layers, human representations come from Vogelherd IV, Hohlenstein-Stadel and Muralovka. The anthropomorphic representation from Vogelherd IV (plate 8:7) is not plain. One end is oval-shaped and separated by a deep groove from a long oval-sectioned part that could be the body. If it is indeed a human representation, the bend on the right edge could be intended to divide back and posterior. As there are no breaks except at the base of the figure it is surely not an animal representation. The surface is decorated with rows of points. A clear human representation comes from Hohlenstein-Stadel (J. Hahn I97ob). The statuette, with a height of I in., had to be reconstructed from about 2oo00 ivory frag- ments. In contrast to the Vogelherd figures, which had been carved from peripheral parts of the mammoth tusk, this statuette had been worked out of a complete tusk section. A big statuette of this kind (plate 9) is more likely to have been exposed to weathering, and so it is only on the interior parts of the legs that the old surface is partially preserved. The legs are well-modelled and show fine details such as ankles. The separately-figured, stretched legs are quite short, and have a marked calf. The feet are realistic as compared with other human representations of the Upper Palaeolithic. The hanging penis makes it obvious that this is a male human figure. Unfortunately, on the long trunk scarcely any part of the original surface is preserved. Only the left arm, which was separated from the body, is intact. On its upper part are six deeply-engraved lines. Only part of the head is preserved. It is slightly rounded and has an upright ear. Judging from its position on top of the head, the ear is probably that of an animal. Comparing this head with the repre- sentations of bears and lions described by Pales (I969), we cannot be certain which of these two animals has been represented. The rounded form of the head probably does not correspond to a bear, however, as bear heads are more conical. No true parallels exist to this unique statuette in Upper Palaeolithic art, in which male representations are rare (cf. the specimen from Brno II; Jelinek, Pelisek and Valoch I959). Another representation which is probably anthropomorphic has been found at Muralovka. Some deeply-engraved lines on an antler polisher (fig. 7:20) suggest a human figure. The triangular incisions at the upper end probably represent the head, the under- lying oval may indicate arms, which are extended from the body, and the deep vertical incision on the lower part could denote the legs. The outline of the polisher does not correspond to the supposedly human engraving on its surface. The interpretation of this engraving as an anthropomorphic representation, as with the object from Vogelherd IV, remains uncertain.</page><page sequence="13">264 Joachim Hahn 5 The place of the Aurignacian industries in Upper Palaeolithic art A comprehensive interpretation of the signs, pendants and art objects of the Aurignacian in central and eastern Europe is not possible, as the number of these objects is very limited. Comparing them with the French Aurignacian, certain analogies and differences are apparent. The signs do not differ very much, although rows of points are seemingly more frequent in France and X-signs are perhaps absent there. The pendants, however, show more pronounced differences. In France, there are frequent stone pendants which are mostly bead-like in shape. Tooth pendants in France often have finely engraved incisions. These do not occur on pendants from central and eastern Europe, but the sample size is so small that we cannot be sure if the contrasting distribution is valid. In France, the art objects comprise human as well as animal representations on stone 'plaquettes', but in their style and shape they differ from those of central and eastern Europe. Animal representations in France exist only in the form of engravings on stones (cf. La Ferrassie; Peyrony 1934), and are never represented in the round, as in Vogel- herd. Human representations are mainly pars pro toto representations of vulvae. A female and an anthropomorphic engraving from Termo-Piolat belong, perhaps, to the Aurig- nacian. Up to the present, only engravings are known in the French Aurignacian, and these are either quite simple or so vague that they cannot be interpreted. A few animals are represented such as reindeer, horse and bovid. The art objects from Vogelherd, on the other hand, comprise all the big game known from faunal inventories of both layers at that site. It seems, therefore, that the main difference between western and central and eastern Europe is that the French material is typified by engravings and paintings, whereas the central and eastern European material is executed mainly in the round. This can be stated for the later Gravettian industries also. Another point of divergence is seen in human representations, the French Aurignacian having engravings of vulvae, while he central and eastern European Aurignacian possess no such representations. The thematic similarity of the represented animals of the earlier Vogelherd layers and the animals from Gravettian sites in central and eastern Europe is already marked, but there are stylistic similarities also, particularly in the hypertrophied convex-concave neck-back line. This overall similarity led Freund (I957) to the hypothesis that the Vogelherd Aurignacian was contemporaneous with the Gravettian. However, the presence of similar signs on both the animal figures and the bone objects suggest that the figurines are of Aurignacian and not Gravettian date. Gravettian animal statuettes generally have no signs. It is unlikely that a typical Aurignacian assemblage of this kind, corresponding quite well to the French Aurignacian I, is much younger in central Europe than in France. The round carved ivory figures from Vogelherd and Hohlenstein-Stadel pose an inter- esting problem in the origins of western art. Leroi-Gourhan (I963: 85-8) distinguishes four stylistic periods for the French Upper Palaeolithic. The rare art objects from the earlier Palaeolithic, like the engraved bone from the Acheulean site at Pech de l'Aze II (Bordes i969) belong to the formative period. Style I is found in the Aurignacian; Style II, characterized by the convex-concave neck-back line, dates to the Gravettian and older Solutrean; Styles III and IV belong to the later Solutrean and Magdalenian. The animal representations of Vogelherd correspond to Leroi-Gourhan's Style II, but they are</page><page sequence="14">Aurignacian signs, pendants and art objects in Central and Eastern Europe 265 associated with the Aurignacian which in France is characterized by Style I. In fact, what we appear to have is two separate artistic traditions in the Aurignacian, one in France and a less well known one in central and eastern Europe.

Aurignacian signs, pendants and art objects in Central and Eastern Europe On the basis of twenty-five assemblages, the author discusses and illustrates the Aurignacian signs, pendants and art objects of central and eastern Europe. The signs are shown to include a number of forms also present in the later Gravettian, where the subjects are more complicated. It appears that there is no significant difference between Aurignacian signs in western and in central and eastern Europe. As for the pendants, more differences are recognizable; in particular, stone pendants and incised tooth pendants are found more frequently in the French Aurignacian. Molluscs found on the sites indicate long-distance contacts. It would seem that two distinct regional stylistic traditions are indicated by surviving representational objects: engravings and paintings are frequent in France, whereas figures carved in the round are more characteristic of the central European assemblages.</page></plain_text>
