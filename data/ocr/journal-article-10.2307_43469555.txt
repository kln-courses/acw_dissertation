<plain_text><page sequence="1">SITTING ON CALCIFIED GROUND The Language of Bone . Jack Driscoll. Spring Valley Press, Langley, Washing- ton. Paper $5.00. driscoll first attracted my attention in the pages of the Ohio Review, pages mostly devoted to his father's re-creation. His work carried with it not only the expected pose of familial recall and ensuing reconciliation and resolution, but carried with it as well a tremendous weight of mystery. He could come to his old man, could lay hands on his important body, could revel in his life and his departure. Yet he was not satisfied with this alone. Instead, he avoided a strictly narrative progression in favor of a jiglike lyrical flow, subordinated the known - highlighted the unknown. A Driscoll poem, as I came to see it, danced until it knew a weariness never before experienced. Whether caught in what appeared to be the simple act of re- iteration or outright fiction-making, downright invention, his poems at- tempted to explain air itself. It is not difficult to imagine Jack DriscolTs range, then, his land; it is less difficult to imagine his seasons; still, it is least difficult to imagine his strategy. As I think of it, nothing is particularly difficult with Driscoll, for his is the language of proprioception. The body has spoken to him, and in his understanding of the planetary laws, he is more than content at allowing the body to go on speaking. "The marsh out back is full of birds," he points out, "deep/in the pulse of his thumb." Or, further, he suggests, 'There was a field/to the right, a fine snow changing shape/in his body." No, this is nothing spectacular - not news to the sophisticate. These, though - and this, then, stands as a caveat - are never the poems of fiery, plastic apocalypse. They will not teach you to dance, one-legged on the edge of a coat hanger. Rather, Driscoll s poems are transparencies. Praise be to Emerson's metaphor, with these poems digested you may calculate anthropomorphic depth, test the eyeball of self. "It feels right," the poet indicates, "asleep on the floor of the tent, moonlight/anchored on her tongue." Beyond the body talk, beyond the thumb's articulation, the tongue's individuality, Driscoll is involved with the psychology of man's worldly isolation. It seems that he figures the flesh is an entropie metaphor, that man is not always able any longer to translate the visceral impulse into language. Therefore, he indicates, we are attempting to invent another means of com- prehending our anatomical past, our primordialness. The plan is not a facile one, though. What is simple about it, however, and what Driscoll is most definite about, is solitude. In fact, the proposition of oneness is so prevalent in section I as to suggest the poet's obsession with such. If rendered 198 spring 1983</page><page sequence="2">in a hypothetical equation, it could read thus: one man alone equals possible salvation - two men equal failure. The language of bone, as he has it, is also the secret of bone. I suppose, to continue our equation, society represents the worst type of failure. Where to another the communistic might provide a means for transcendence, to Driscoll it only further engenders paranoia. Like so many of the world's seers, he is dissatisfied with the random gathering we have labeled our daily interaction. Section II, in its bleak entirety, addresses just such a confused notion of tribe, making issue unexplained deaths and outright murders, hit and run, hangings, supposed accidents, etc. I offer the first stanza of "The Puzzle of Hangings" as proof. I warn you, it is a world of specious trails, of devilish sense: And sometimes you find them in basements their hands in their pockets, hats on as if they meant to walk outside at night for a smoke. Or I might offer the first stanza in "Hit and Run" : She is always the one with snow in her teeth, her head cocked against the grey drift on the side of the street. Placed in a section utterly sour and devoted to the nearly macabre, these poems accrue a tremendously ironic force. It is as if in arranging the text, Driscoll understood the psyche's need for immediate compensation: one sec- tion of praise at midday, one of unexplained ax-blow in the deep dark. If there is anything in The Language of Bone that is plainly irksome, though, it is not this manifest shadow content, but rather the poems of the section following; for in the third section the poet moves from his self- concern, adopting the persona of Scanlon, a latent character at best - latent, that is, in his relation to the text. Why Drisco√¨l chose to make these eight poems serve as the text's physical fulcrum is difficult to determine. With even a preliminary overview, it should have been eminently clear to Driscoll that his strength certainly lay in personal discovery via confrontation and encounter. For some, removal of this sort - for what else can we term this spurious adoption - is inevitable, predictable. For this poet, however, taking a step back means a mere act of distance. The poet loses the velocity of self. As he finally, consciously indicates within the section itself, in "Scanlons Conclusion": "It has been a waste of time." Yet, as if in another intuitive, compensatory stroke, the poet does SOUTHWEST Review 199</page><page sequence="3">withdraw from his persona-linked removal. Section IX's opener, "Sleeping on a Raft," seems to anticipate reader disillusionment, as it offers the neces- sary return to self. "The woman next to me/curls in the dream of her arms, listens," Driscoll points out, "all night to the tides/pulling heavy under her skin." He is witness once more, He. Again, the poet makes himself familiar with what truly stands familiar in our lives, the body. More importantly, he engages in the 1 again. He may be speaking of his mailman, of building a house, of walking; regardless, he is talking from the credible and expected base of personal identification. The potentiality of the "other" is never en- tirely dispensed with, though, for the self is recognized - no, heralded - as being of many fabrics, many skills. Please, then, think of the first stanza of "The Meeting/2" as an accountancy of layers, dermas: Tonight, leaning into the bathroom mirror I lean into an oxygen tent and swallow your air. Mouth to mouth I blow this poem into your lungs. Of the lives and layers he investigates, and of the selves he observes, his father receives brilliant attention in "My Father, Lost Hunting." Without doubt, we are presented with a multiplicity of figures, represented in the sparse line by only a simple triune, father/deer/self. Yet these combine to project a unity of despair much larger than that anticipated. Driscoll is a master of this form of extended metaphor. His tales are fleshless, yet full- bodied. The lyric pushes off into the world of the narrative and is afforded its own type of habiliments. In the end, if we were to attempt a summary of the poet's concerns in The Language of Bone, we would inevitably return to the concern of body, what the anatomy knows. The most trustworthy utterances are, perforce, those closest to their frame - emanate from a noun-center, a thing, a mysti- cally imbued structure. Above this colloquy of femur, gossip of shank, oratory of metatarsus all is superfluous, misdirecting. Who can put faith in the ego's meanderings? No - to hear anything we must sit down quietly and atten- tively in and/or on the calcified ground. We must sit on the base, however fractured it appears, and allow for the essential transmission of centuries. In short, we must end in the act of "Keeping In Touch": Sometimes driving between these fields at night I notice the wind pick up, 200 spring 1983</page><page sequence="4">the same that brings letters to my door. I always stop and open them here on the hood of my car where the wind has just been leaning. The pages are blank and when I let them go they float into the dark grass behind the barbed-wire fence, hundreds of them among the cows. Back home I answer them all in dreams, the words breaking in the bones of my tongue. Jeff Schiff McNeese State University</page></plain_text>
