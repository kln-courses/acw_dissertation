<plain_text><page sequence="1">MHS COLLECTIONS OJIBWAY BEADWORK TRADITIONS in the Ayer Collections Marcia G. Anderson and Kathy L. Hussey-Arntson ON THE WESTERN SHORE of Mille Lacs Lake, north of Onamia, is one of the most significant groups of collec tions in the museum holdings of the Minnesota Histori cal Society. On exhibit at the Mille Lacs Indian Museum and Trading Post are many of the Ojibway and other Indian artifacts that make up a large part of the Jeannette O. and Harry D. Ayer collections. The Minnesota Ojib way material is particularly impressive. While it is broad in scope, it does show some inequalities in the number of items represented in any one subject area. There are few examples of games, fishing gear, women's clothing, and pre-1880s material, while woven yarn bags, birch-bark containers, dolls, and smoking equip ment are extensively represented. The collection's strengths seem to lie in the type of crafts made for com mercial sale.1 Beadwork is one of the common characteristics of the Ojibway artifacts. It is a craft executed by Ojibway women to decorate items for personal use or for sale. This collection contains examples of a broad variety of techniques and decorated surfaces and permits new in sights into the design and production of beaded items during the first half of the 20th century. The value of a collection of this kind cannot be estab lished or put into perspective without proper proveni ence. To understand better the scope and composition of the Ojibway collection, it is necessary to review briefly the history of the Ayers during their residence at Mille Lacs. Minnesotans Jeannette O. Foster and Harry D. Ayer, who were married in St. Paul in 1908, moved to the Mille Lacs area sometime between 1914 and 1919. There they took over operation of a trading post formerly run by David H. Robbins on Vineland Bay.2 In 1918 the United States Indian Service, operating out of the White Earth Reservation, granted the Ayers a license allowing them to trade with the Mille Lacs Ojib way and to occupy and use certain buildings for a store and residence. In March, 1925, the Ayers were asked to vacate the Robbins buildings, which were to be used for an Indian school. By the end of the decade, they had built the trading post still in use.3 In its early years this structure located on the edge of 1 There are several spellings of the name Ojibway: common variations are Ojibwe, Ojibwa, and Chippewa; the Ojibway are known in their own language as Anishinabe. The Ayer Indian collection of approximately 1,400 items focuses primarily on the artifacts of Minnesota Ojibway Indians from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s; it also includes a signifi cant group of textiles, ceramics, and basketry from the South west and a small sampling from the Pacific Northwest of North America. Most of the latter appear to be from the early to mid 1900s and produced for commercial sale. 2Wedding announcement, October 20, 1908, and J. H. Hinton to H. D.

It is possible they spent time in both places before making a final move. 3 Hinton to Ayer, November 20, 1918, and P. R.

Marcia Anderson, who holds a masters degree in anthropology with emphasis in museum studies from the University of Arizo na, is curator of the MHS museum collections. Kathy Hussey Arntson, who is completing a masters degree in anthropology at the University of Minnesota, has spent two years surveying and cataloging the Ayer and other Indian collections in the MHS.

In the years that followed, the Ayers added a number of other businesses, including rental cottages, the construction, sale, and repair of boats, a maple syrup and sugar busi ness, and fisherman guide services. The Ayers' interest in the local community led to personal collecting of Ojib way artifacts, as well as purchasing local craftwork for sale at the post. They also bought Indian goods to sell at the post from numerous North American firms in Arizo na, New Mexico, Texas, Alaska, and elsewhere.4 The Ayers were neighbors, friends, employers of, and vendors for the Ojibway at Mille Lacs. Because the various Indian agents employed by the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs for the Mille Lacs band were nearly 170 miles away at the White Earth Reservation, Harry Ayer assumed the role of mediator, executor, or administrator of Ojibway estates and acted occasionally as their spokesman to the White Earth agents.5 Over the years souvenirs became the mainstay of the Ayers' business, and the trading post became less of a general store. In 1959 Mr. and Mrs. Ayer, seven years before their deaths, donated their entire estate to the MHS. The gift included 104 acres of land, the post, a new building for exhibiting their collections, and a trust fund to support and expand the museum. The trading post is now the bookstore and gift shop for the Mille Lacs Indian Museum. SINCE the Ayers and the early 20th-century Ojibway artists and craftsmen are no longer living, photographs in the society's audio-visual library and documentary evi dence such as business records in the division of archives and manuscripts help to piece together the story behind the collections. While much information can be gained from this material, the data are spotty and incomplete. As a result of some recent efforts to supplement the Ayer records, copies of Southwest trader Lorenzo Hubbell's letters to the Minnesotans are now in the couple's papers.6 The development of a commercial relationship be tween the Ayers and the Mille Lacs band is particularly apparent in the trading post account ledgers. The Ayers ordered merchandise from bead supply companies that imported their beads from European manufacturers, and the Mille Lacs Ojibway purchased beads, velvet, thread, needles, braid, cloth, and ribbon at the post. Entries relating to the production of beaded items, recorded under the name of the purchaser, appear frequently in the ledgers. In the late 1920s and early 1930s the trading post accounts of Dick Skinaway, Mrs. John Dorr, Sr., John Mink, Taylor and Jim Hanks, Maggie Skinaway, Frank Nickaboine, Jess Wadena, Dick Garbow, Jim and Mrs. Sam Keg, Equay, Mrs. Joe Shakopee, and Sam Mitchell indicate that someone in each family was doing beadwork. One Ojibway customer, Jim Hanks, bought supplies over a six-month period in 1929 that in cluded beads at $1.50, thread at $.21, and needles at $.05. Some of these family names can be tied directly to beaded items in the collection today.7 The ledger records do not describe how the materials 4The Ayers formed the Mille Lacs Products Co. with John Martin and T.

The Ojibway beadwork in the Ayer collection exemplifies most of the design and style characteristics seen in this craft during the 19th and 20th centuries. It decorates objects made from velvet, trade wool, leather, and birch bark, as well as items composed entirely of beads. One distinctive feature of this beadwork is the use of color. The Ojibway do not express color preferences so much as they reveal a desire to use a wide variety of colors. One exception to this might be the color chosen for the background: dark backgrounds are often made of cloth (black, dark blue, or red); light backgrounds gener ally are created by filling in the area with beads (white, gray, or transparent). Before the use of dark cloth, tanned animal skins were dyed black as a background for the porcupine quillwork that was common until deco ration with beadwork began. Until the late 1800s, colors were few, and all-white designs were more prevalent.8 The Ojibway use a number of different designs and techniques in their beadwork.

Less common designs include zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, dream, and clan sym bols. From non-Indian cultures the Ojibway frequently incorporate motifs like flags, cornucopias, pineapples, and script or printing. Border motifs are most commonly composed of a variety of geometric patterns such as zig zag lines, strings of diamonds, and a traditional Ojibway motif called otter tail. Of the many different designs to be seen in the Ayer collection, the floral-curvilinear is the most frequent. It is found alone and in combination with most of the other designs. Common floral motifs include oak leaves, wild roses, grapevines, lilies, pine cones, and a pomegranate shape that might also be a stylized acorn. Geometric designs are well represented but are less common in the Ayer collection. The technical sophistica tion of Ojibway geometric design is apparent in the com binations of a variety of motifs. Frequently, popular motifs such as stylized flowers, diamonds, stars, V shapes, crosses, and arrows were used in conjunction with each other. The beadwork on Ojibway bandolier bags often com bines floral-curvilinear and geometric designs with other motifs. Maple leaves, vines, and flowers combined with cornucopias, an American shield, and the name "Ed Skinaway" applied in script decorate one such bag in the Ayer collection. Another one incorporates several 8 Carrie A. Lyford, The Crafts of the Ojibwa, 151 (Educa tion Division, Office of Indian Affairs, Indian Handcraft Series, vol. 5 ?

A floral vine theme, for example, cannot be replicated on a birch-bark container with the same effectiveness as on a velvet breechcloth. Most floral-curvilinear designs are produced by a technique referred to as spot-stitch embroidery, in which strands of beads are stitched to the surface every two or three beads. When the Ojibway beadworker places the beads, she follows the motif's outline working freehand from the outer edge to the center, rather than applying beads in straight lines, up and down, or left and right. In contrast, loom-woven beadwork lends itself almost exclusively to geometric designs. The beadworker em ploys linen or cotton thread to warp a rectangular frame. The warping can be single or double, and beads are worked in with a needle and the weft thread. One bead is placed between each warp or pair of warps, using a plain weave, under-and-over technique, resulting in a design commonly referred to as square weave.10 The Ayer collection also contains several examples of more unusual techniques. One necklace was produced by braiding together clusters of beaded strands. Another, an early 19th-century example, is a finger woven sash of wool yarn. White pony beads decorate the sash in interwoven geometric designs that are inserted during the weaving process. A thread prestrung with beads crosses over and under the woolen warp and weft threads. Additional techniques displayed in the collec tion are horizontal net weave, beaded edge finish, daisy chain, and strung beads used in necklaces and fringe. These techniques require numerous supplies, including needles, thread, sinew (used in older examples), glass or faceted metal beads (including seed, pony, necklace, and tubular size), sequins, and a surface onto which the beads are applied (velvets, trade wools, tanned animal skins, birch bark, cottons, or ribbons).11 accession nos. 10,000.615 and 10,000.152, in MHS museum department.

MILLE LACS residents George Nickaboine, George Pendageyosh, and Jim Hanks, Jr. in 1930, wear ing beaded outfits reserved for spe cial occasions Whether bead supplies decorated personal family apparel or items to be sold at the trading post is unclear. The Ayer collection has several good examples of both groups. Many Ojibway beadworkers decorated leggings, breechcloths, wrist cuffs, armbands, moccasins, belts, sashes, dresses, bandolier bags, pipe bags, vests, shirt front panels, drum bands, cradleboard bands, dolls, quivers, knife and awl cases, knee garters, and courting flutes for themselves or family and community mem bers. The Ayer collection contains examples of these items, with specific ones made by family members of Ed Skinaway, Jim Hanks, Mary Hudson Barney (known as "Chi Bi Bi"), and Charlie Boyd.12 But crafts decorated for sale in the trading post were usually of a different nature. Many objects such as nap kin rings, pincushions, watch fobs, bracelets, purses, and bookmarks are forms from non-Ojibway cultures. More traditional decorated pieces are moccasins, beaded bags, neck chains, and birch-bark containers. In 1927 the Ayers purchased beaded and other souvenir goods from the Ojibway totaling $2,209.25, and the society con tinues to purchase beadwork and other crafts for the Mille Lacs Indian Museum and Trading Post.13 Women are the traditional beadworkers among the Ojibway. While they continue to use many of the earlier techniques and designs, they also create new motifs and discover new surfaces and objects to decorate. Sold at the post today are belt buckles, earrings, key chains, and eyeglass cases as well as moccasins, bags, necklaces, and pendants. Young Ojibway women are doing beadwork, although they are also busy with full-time jobs and other activities. Some of the most active beadworkers in the Mille Lacs band ? Maude Kegg, Batiste Sam, Lorena Gahbow, Margaret Hill, and Cecelia Dorr, for example ? are descendants of those beadworkers who sold their work to Harry and Jeannette Ayer in the first half of this century.14 The whole story of the Ojibway beadworkers at Mille Lacs remains to be told, but thanks to the scope of the Ayer collections, the society is beginning to docu ment the important and ongoing tradition of a native craft technique. 12Accession nos. 10,000.615, 10,000.145, 10,000.619, and 10,000.620, in MHS museum department. 13Indian Room Inventory, vol. 88, Fall, [1940]; Souvenir Inventory, vol. 90, 1946; Souvenir Room Inventory, vol. 89, 1947-50; "Summary of Goods Bought from Indians in 1927" ? all in Ayer Papers. 14 Telephone interview with Floyd Ballinger, site manager at the Mille Lacs Indian Museum and Trading Post, April 30, 1982.
