The much larger numbers of official cults of regional and local extension are not included here. Some Preliminary Considerations In terms of its ultimate raison d'etre, the Chinese empire may be seen as the mundane vehicle of universal salvation, where salva- tion is understood as social harmorly, and as harmony between human society and the ever-unfolding cosmos. As S.N. Eisenstadt said of the Chinese empire, "The political-cultural center and sphere were seen in Confucian-legalist China as the major focus of the resolution of the tension between the transcendental and the mundane order."2 This in turn implies that the empire was not conceived of as a state in the sense of an autonomous, free- standing legal construct; it was virtually coextensive with Chinese society, and not clearly distinguished from it.3 To quote from l I wish to acnowledge the assistance of my Minnesota friend and colleague, Zhang Wenying W@;, at the inception of this project some ten years ago, and to express my thanks for a research grant from the Graduate School of the University of Minnesota. 2 S.N.

These patterns were held to be accessible to human reason and to have first been dis- cerned by the mythical sages and translated by them into the eternal patterns of human social order. In the Neo-Confucian orthodoxy of the Ming and Qing dynasties, this claim was taken a step further: a cosmogonic patterning agency (Ii X) was held to be immanent in all phenomena, including human relationships, and it was held to be manifested in the laws of the empire.5 Historical rulership succeeded to transcendent sagehood and was differentiated into two aspects: the civil wen and the military wu. This differentiation, which probably occurred in Zhou times, was symbolized in the representation of the Zhou conquerors of the evil Shang court as Wen Wang @:i and Wu Wang A-T. That is, the Zhou house won the mandate of heaven when the paradig- matic martial virtue of the son was placed at the service of the paradigmatic civil virtue of the father. In the later evolution of Chinese rulership, the emperor as- sumed the mantle of the sage, transcending both attributes. The wen and wu were institutionalized in the civil and military voca- tions, each with its schools, canon, cult and service. The military aspect of rulership was encompassed by the civil.6 The sages were the mythic embodiment of the civil virtues, who bestowed upon the world all the necessary attributes of harmoni- ous civilized life. From the perspective of imperial orthodoxy, the martial aspect of rulership, originally latent in the sages, was only differentiated in an age of tragic moral decline when strife fol- Prasenjit Duara, "Superscribing Symbols: The Myth of Guandi, Chinese God of War," Journal of Asian Studies 47:4 (1988), pp. 782-785. 4 Eisenstadt, Origin and Diversity, p. 296. 5 This claim is made explicitly in a preface contributed by the Ming emperor Xiaozong to the Da Ming huidian *Pi*At in 1503.

The empire's salvific mission placed the civil cults at the center of the official religion and marginalized the military cults. Official Religion The outlines of the official religion of the Chinese empire were laid down in the course of the former and later Han dynasties. The liturgical center was occupied by the person of the emperor. The Han Confucian scholar and minister Dong Zhongshu X!1+f used a figure of great power and simplicity to define the role of the emperor.7 In the character wang T--1, for "sovereign," he as- serted that the three horizontal strokes represent the cosmic trin- ity: Man flanked by Heaven above and Earth below. The vertical line represents the emperor who, by his carefully regulated activi- ties, maintains the three domains in their proper relationships with one another. Extending the figure to the conjugal family, heaven/father engenders, earth/mother nurtures, humankind/ child completes, and the emperor/son of heaven preserves the cosmos/family harmony. Thus, according to the Doctrine of the Mean (Zhongyong rF4f), "No one but the emperor may discuss the rites, make laws, or standardize the written language."8 Offering rites for the spirits made up an important part of the official religion. It was especially, but not exclusively, by the timely and liturgically correct performance of these rites that human relations were adjusted and exemplified and human society har- monized with the cosmogonic processes. In Zhou, as we are informed by the Li ji, subjects of all social ranks down to, but not including, the common people were as- signed their proper ceremonial responsibilities. This rule, with the addition of the common people, survived the establishment of the empire, with local officials assuming ceremonial functions corresponding to those assigned to the ancient nobility of corres- ponding rank. The spirits were essentially of three kinds: celestial, terrestrial, and human. Spirits of the first two kinds were under- stood to be coeval with the universe and were immanent in natu- ral phenomena; if the mountains produced rain, this occurred 7 W.T. de Bary et al., ed., Sources of Chzinese Tradition (New York, Columbia University Press, 1960), p. 179. 8 S.

Only the sovereign made offerings to the celestial power of heaven and to that of the earth in its entirety. His dukes and marquises (or, in imperial times, his local officials) made offerings to the spirits of the mountains and waters within their domains. Official Altars and Temples The Collected Statutes of the Ming and Qing provided a legal definition of the official religion. Spirits of the official pantheon were named; the calendar and the liturgical rules for offerings were provided, together with specifications for the design and construction of the altars, temples and shrines where the rites were to be performed. Some of the statutory cults were univer- sally established in the counties throughout the empire,9 others were legally established only in certain regions or counties. When viewed from the imperial center, all of this seems clear. The official religion and its sacred places as seen from the point of view of the prefectures and counties is less clear, however, and in some instances not clear at all. One difficulty is that "official" is ambiguous. As I will use the term here, it denotes only those altars and temples that were reported in the gazetteers to have been used by the local officials in their official capacity, or by their delegates, for the performance of the rites required by law. This narrow definition excludes what I shall call "quasi-official" temples. The latter are of three kinds. First are the lay temples that are dedicated to spirits also served by an official temple in the same county. An obvious case in point would be the proliferation of Guandi NV temples found in many counties. These are "official" only in the sense that they are, at least nominally, dedicated to a spirit that not only belongs to the official pantheon, but that is properly served in an official temple in the same county. The second kind are those that are dedicated to spirits that belong to the official pantheon but are not legally served in the county in question. A case in point would be the spirit of Taishan [U, popularly called the Eastern Peak (Dongyue RX). The hun- 9 These were covered in the Sacrificial Statutes of the Officials (Yousi sidian JPI ), in Da Ming huidian 94, p. 2129 ff. The corresponding section in Da Qing huidian is the "Sacrificial Statutes in the Several Provinces" (Gesheng zhi lieyu sidian wI]BIe^) (1899, reprint Taibei, 1963, 36:1a).</page><page sequence="5">OFFICIAL ALTARS, TEMPLES AND SHRINES 97 dreds of Eastern Peak temples throughout the empire, with the exceptions of the three in Tai'an, Beijing and Nanjing, were not authorized by law. The third "quasi-official" class are those temples that were added to the local roster of official temples by the local officials apparently on their own authority. This exercise of "local option" was occasionally acknowledged by the compilers of the gazetteers, but temples of this class are often difficult to identify with any confidence: they often merge imperceptibly with the preceding official temples and with the following lay temples. In addition to these three classes of quasi-official temples, there are two classes of non-official temples that could be said to enjoy some degree of official standing. One would include those that were conspicuously patronized by officials in a private, or extra-legal, capacity. As a result of such patronage, these temples may have enjoyed some degree of official standing in the eyes of local people. This class might be extended to include those pa- tronized by members of the local degree-holding gentry who were seen as social peers of the officials. The other such class would be that of the temples formally and firmly classified in the gazetteers as Buddhist or Daoist. These were presumably so classified be- cause they fell under the jurisdiction of the officially appointed Buddhist and Daoist registrars. These owed some degree of offi- cial standing to their formal subordination to a hierarchy of local offices culminating in the ministry of rites. Beyond the bounds of these kinds of non-official temple were still others of two kinds: those that were implicitly tolerated at least to the extent that they were not specifically disapproved of, and those that were specfically described as "heterodox" (yin i or xie if). The Classical Core At the core of the official religion were certain rites that had been adapted from such ancient texts as the Li ji and the Zhou Li, and others that were specifically associated with the teachings and tradition of the Confucian literati. Some of the rites of the clas- sical core were performed at open-air altars outside the walls of the prefectural and county cities; others were performed in ur- ban temples and shrines.</page><page sequence="6">98 ROMEYN TAYLOR Altars According to the official orthodoxy, spirits of the heavens, the landscape, and the space between, were understood to be spon- taneous phenomena coeval with the universe, and to share with the Supreme Lord of August Heaven (Haotian shangdi MitW) a collective disposition, or will, to universal harmony. In the words attributed to the founder of the Ming dynasty, Now, the sacred peaks, guardian mountains, oceans, great rivers, all the high mountains and wide waters were created by Heaven and Earth. Down to the present time, their brilliant, numinous material force (qi %) has congealed to form their spirits. All of them received their destiny from Shangdi. This is an unfathomable mysteIy.l° Because they were not in any way to be confused with the spirits of deceased humans, they were not to be awarded honorific titles, represented by images, or housed in shrines or temples. In ac- cordance with the liturgy prescribed by the Ministry of Rites, they were to be served, instead, on open-air altars and represented by wooden tablets. The prefectural and county altars were situated just outside the city walls, and their placement and orientation were determined on cosmological principles. When the local of- ficials and gentry gathered on the appointed days to perform the rites, the spirits were invited to come to their suburban altars from their clouds, mountains, or waters, to be served with rever- ence and gratitude by the beneficiaries of their care. The standard set of county suburban altars from the first reign of the Ming consisted of one, outside the west gate and facing north, for Soil and Grain (Shefi trit); one, outside the south gate and facing south, for Wind, Cloud, Thunder and Rain (feng yun tei yu PRtiM), Mountains and Rivers, and Walls and Moats (shan chuan chenghuang S)11S1S) this was renamed Altar of Celestial and Terrestrial Spirits (Shenqi tan 1"aX) in 1811;1l and one out- side the north gate and facing south for Abandoned Ghosts (Li X). A fourth, the altar for The First Farmer (Xiannong S=c.), outside the east gate and facing south, was added to the roster of county altars in 1726. The provision of altars for First Farmer and the ghosts, for whom temples might seem to have been more appropriate because they were spirits of deceased humans, 10 Veritable Records of Ming Taizu (Ming Taizu shilu "MSS1w) (Facsimile re- print, Nangang, Academia Sinica, 1965), 53:1b. ll Lishui xianzAi &amp;Sc",* ( 1883), 8:1b.</page><page sequence="7">OFFICIAL ALTARS, TEMPLES AND SHRINES 99 whether legendary or historical, may appear incongruous. In the case of the altar rites for First Farmer, this demiurge was invoked in association with the annual spring plowing rite in the sacred field. The ghosts were served on altars because of their anonym- ity; they could not have been addressed by name or title, like the spirits properly housed in the shrines and temples. The meaning of the altar rites was summarized as follows in a sixteenth century gazetteer: It is by the she IFt and ji f that the common people are nurtured; it is by the famous mountains and great rivers that the clouds are formed to make rain and generate all living things, and thereby to nurture the common people. [Such] accomplishment manifests the immanent patterns li. It is thus fitting to make supplications and give thanks. Then the living will first have that which nurtures them and, after that, if the abandoned ghost altars are not neglected, the dead will have somewhere to return to.12 A nineteenth century gazetteer outlined the cosmological basis for the location of the altars in these terms: The Sheji tan is the ruler of the county (yizhu EJ). [The altar] is es- tablished in the west, which is the direction in which the ten thou- sand things are completed. Offerings are made on the first wvu ; days'3 in the mid months of spring and autumn. Offerings are the shaolao JVV (a sheep and a pig), and four baskets and four stemmed vessels of food, and four bolts of black silk. The altar of wind, cloud, thunder and rain and mountains and riv- ers is called the "southern altar." The altar of the First Farmer is es- tablished to the east of it. This accords with yang W." The spirit of walls and moats is classified with the rivers and mountains. There- fore offerings to him are made here also.15 The ritual calendar and offerings are the same as those for the western (soil and grain) altar. The silk is white. The Altar of First Farmer is built in the eastern suburb, in the direc- tion of the birth of the ten thousand things. Offerings are made on a hai a day in mid month of spring. On the same day, [the officials] plow the sacred field. 12 Chongxiu Baoding (un) zhi z ( 0 ) (1505), 19.1a. 13 Here, as elsewhere, this formula denotes a day in the cycles of ten and twelve that comprise the sexagenary calendrical cycle. 14 The bright and active form of the material force, which gains strength in the spring and is associated with the resumption of agricultural labor. 15 Under his other aspect as an anthropomorphic spirit of popular origin, the spirit of walls and moats was also provided with a temple in the city.</page><page sequence="8">100 ROMEYN TAYLOR The Li tan (FX,) offers rites to the dead. Offerings on qingming, the fifteenth day of the seventh month and the first day of the tenth month. For this offering, cause Chenghuang to be the host. The offerings are the same as for the Western Altar (soil and grain al- tar). 16 Cosmological principles were also invoked in determining the rank order in which the altars were listed. As one compiler ex- plains it, citing the Comprehensive Study of the Five Rites (Wuli tongkao Ki i Wind, Cloud, Thunder and Rain are spirits of Heaven; Soil [and] Grain, Mountains and Rivers are spirits of Earth; First Farmer and the abandoned ghosts are human spirits, and therefore they are listed in that order.17 It should be noted however that the soil and grain altar, as "ruler of the county," is usually placed ahead of the altar of wind, cloud, thunder and rain and mountains and rivers, but even here, the celestial Wind, Cloud, Thunder and Rain always precede ter- restrial Mountains and Rivers. School Temples Civil officials and local gentry generously, and even lavishly, supported the shrines and temples that were built on the prefec- tural and county school campuses.18 This ostensibly expressed their shared interest in serving their own vocational cult as latter- day disciples of Confucius. The single original temple, the Tem- ple of Civility (Wenmiao tZJ), was dedicated to Confucius and a pantheon of Confucian scholars and worthies.19 This was eventu- ally augmented by the addition of five more shrines: the Shrine of the Mentor Sages (Qisheng ci '2-M), for the fathers of Con- fucius and certain disciples, first decreed in 1531 and renamed 16 Mou Yingzhen *X, comp., Yucheng xianzhi JAin', (1808), 6:1b. 17 Zheng Deshu *4M, comp., Yongshou xianzhi ' (1888 ed., reprint Taibei, 1970), 5:35b. 18 The school temple liturgy appears in Da Ming huidian 91, p. 2080 ff. 19 The main shrine was formally named the Hall of Great Accomplishment (Dacheng dian k1I1). This was changed to Temple of the First Teacher (Xianshi miao kgilli) in 1530. Da Ming huidian 91, p. 2081. The spirits served in the temple's main hall and two galleries are listed in Da Ming huidian, pp. 2086-2090. Changes in the list were made subsequently.</page><page sequence="9">OFFICIAL ALTARS, TEMPLES AND SHRINES 101 Shrine of the Revered Sages (Chongsheng ci ^w*i) in 1723; the Shrine of Famous [local] Officials (Minghuan ci MWWIR) and Shrine of Local Worthies (Xiangxian ci Ofifl), both standard from about 1531; the Shrine of the Loyal, Righteous, Filial and Brotherly (Zhongyi xiaodi ci J,VA*0@g) and the Shrine of the Chaste and Dutiful (Jiexiao ci MMili4), both decreed in 1723. The last four of these served the spirits of natives of the prefecture or county, and thus served to merge local history into the broader history of the Confucian tradition. A Temple for Literary Glory (Wenchang miao 3 J A1) was added to the standard roster in 1814, but the previous history of this cult suggests that it belongs rather in the category of official temples of popular cults, de- scribed below. Taken together, these places of worship celebrated the dedica- tion of the civil officials and local gentry to the Confucian "trans- mission of the Way," to the vocation of civil office-holding, to classical learning, and to the virtues most prized in their tradi- tion. The compiler of a sixteenth century gazetteer, Fan Shen iX, exemplified the historical class-consciousness and sense of mis- sion of the literati when he wrote: Long have the laws of the Three Dynasties been ruined! All that has survived of them and has not collapsed in the present time has been the single enterprise of the schools, and that is all. However, if the temples are not beautified, then there will be no means whereby to give peace to the bright spirits nor achieve the highest possible de- gree of reverence. If the school buildings are not beautified, then there will be no means by which to make teaching flourish, to nur- ture the talents of worthies. Now, to inquire into the local histories: at the end of the Yuan the mourning [rites] were in disorder. With that dynasty's vicissitudes, the Confucian schools were mostly ruined. At the beginning of Hongwu of the present dynasty, an edict was received [that schools] were to be built. At the beginning of Yongle, with the crossing of the river and the war of succession, much of the land was fought over and the Confucian schools again were ruined. The officials re- built them once more. This was hard, alas! If they survive in the present time .... then we [need] not build them anew, but [merely] put them in good order and repair. We can easily make this effort! Can we shrink from this and not do it?20 20 Fan Shen, Hejianfuzhi POMP (1540), 5:29a.</page><page sequence="10">102 ROMEYN TAYLOR Officiat Shrznes of Popular Cults The local altars and temples of the "classical core" were the exclusive domain of the ruling literati class. It was at the altars, out of the sight of their social inferiors, that the civil officials and local gentry participated with the distant emperor in the adjust- ment of human and cosmic order. And it was in the county school temples and shrines that they ritually reenforced their role as disciples of the sages and guardians of their Way. Where the shrines and temples of the classical core distin- guished the ruling class from the ruled, those that were used in the official rites that were offered to widely popular deities pro- vided a setting in which the classes were brought into mutual contact around nominally identical cults. Three of the many of- ficial cults of this kind eventually became universal throughout the empire: those of the sprits of walls and moats, of Guandi, and of Wenchang. Their official temples, which were vastly outnum- bered by the non-official, were public spaces. All three cults were recorded in their popular forms at least from the Tang Dynasty, and had achieved some degree of popu- larity by the beginning of the Ming. All three had a martial aspect, and were thought to protect their local communities against human and natural calamities, but they were also differentiated from one another with respect to their particular abilities and more specialized constituencies. In the official liturgy of Ming and Qing, the city gods were primordial spirits engendered by the physical mass of the walls and moats,2l but in the popular religion, they were historical human spirits who served as power- ful officials in a spiritual empire that descended from the celestial Jade Emperor successively to the god of the Eastern Peak, the city gods, the tudi tX, and finally to the domestic stove god Zaoshen kS". This empire of spirits had jurisdiction over the destiny of human souls in this life and the next.22 Guandi, the apotheosis of the late Han and Three Kingdoms military hero, Guan Yu 1RM, became a paragon of loyalty and righteousness and was especially important to merchants and to military men, among his many constituents throughout the empire. Literary Glory (Wenchang) owed his disparate aspects as both a tutelary 21 Ming Taizu shilu, 49:2a, 53:1b. 22 Henri Maspero, Le taoisme (Paris, Gallimard, 1971), pp. 101-146.</page><page sequence="11">OFFICIAL ALTARS, TEMPLES AND SHRINES 103 spirit of the literati and a warrior spirit to his double origin in a star god and a Sichuan hero cult.23 The addition of spirits of deceased humans to the official pan- theon was authorized on good classical authority. In the Jifa N section of the Liji, the list of then-standard cults was followed by an injunction to add the cults of spirits of historical figures in gratitude for their benefactions to the common people. In this there was a principle of justice: the requital of good and the ven- eration of greatness.24 The city gods had enjoyed official county-level status through- out the Ming and Qing. Despite the salience of the official cult of Guan Yu from the Wanli reign (1573-1620) of the Ming through the Qing, however, it has proven difficult to determine when his temples were first made mandatory at the county level. This can- not have been later than 1725 when liturgical rules for the rites were promulgated to all the prefectures and counties, and this is taken here as the beginning date for the official local cult.25 Official temples for Literary Glory (Wenchang) had been estab- lished in all the schools during the Yuan dynasty26 and this again became an official cult on the county level by an edict of 1801 with the same rank as Guandi.27 During the Ming and early Qing, the cult survived in many of the schools, but apparently without legal sanction. A memorial approved in 1488 even re- quired that the cult be abolished everywhere outside of Sichuan, 23 Terry Klceman, "Wenchang 11: and the Viper: The Creation of a Chinese National God" (doctoral dissertation, Ann Arbor: University Microfilms Interna- tional, 1988), p. 459. 24 LiJi, tr. Couvreur, v. 2, pp. 268-270. 25 The establishment of the county-level cult may have been as early as 1614; a gazetteer recorded the liturgical reform of a local Guandi temple in 1615 apparently in response to an edict of the previous year concerning the re- investiture of the spirit with imperial rank.

I have not found firm evidence, however, before an edict promulgated to all local ad- ministrations in 1725, which contained a revised official liturgy.

Much of this work has been focussed on specific issues in religion, on certain localities or regions, or on specfic cults such as those of Guanyin, Guandi, Tianhou, Zhenwu and Wen- chang. There have also been a few comprehensive studies of Chinese religion from a sociological or anthropological perspec- tive. The present study is part of a broader undertaking to pre- sent a quantitative over-view of the history of religions in late imperial China focussed upon a survey of the history of recorded places of worship. At the simplest level, this is intended to clarify changing patterns of religious belief and practice by region and over time. It is meant also to provide material that can be analyzed from the perspective of social history. Method The quantification of data concerning the late imperial history of Chinese temples presents a tactical problem. The amount of information is immense and widely scattered through Chinese literature. My solution in this case has been to confine the sources for this study to a single genre-that of the local histories (fangzhi). Basic historical information about the temples is pre- sented in the gazetteers in roughly standardized form in the tem- ple inventories. In order further to reduce the task to manage- able proportions, a random sample was taken of the administra- tive seats listed in the administrative geography section (Fangyu huibian f t*: zhifang dian JAI) of the Imperial Encyclopae- dia Gujin tushu jicheng. The 1,544 local administrative units in the administrative geog- raphy section were numbered serially. By means of a random number table, one thirtieth of them were sampled in each prov- ince. The sample yielded fifty-three prefectures, subprefectures and counties. When the sampled unit was a prefecture with 28 Ming shi 50, pp. 568.6-569.0; Guangxu Ninghai xianzhi, 4:1 a.</page><page sequence="13">OFFICIAL ALTARS, TEMPLES AND SHRINES 105 several dependent counties or subprefectures, it was represented by the county that was seated in the prefectural city.29 The counties and subprefectures were not equally well pro- vided with gazetteers, but wherever possible gazetteers for that specific administrative unit were found, and a mix of early and later gazetteers was sought. In the absence of a gazetteer specific to the unit, data for the county or subprefecture were taken from the prefectural and provincial gazetteers. The administrative ge- ography section of the Imperial Encyclopaedia, which was based upon gazetteers, was also consulted for all the places selected.30 The temples recorded for each locality in these texts were num- bered, and data pertaining to them was then encoded and clas- sified under eleven topical heads in a relational database. The numbers reproduced in the tables below were obtained by inquir- ies from the data base. Several rules were applied in inferring the numbers of temples extant in each of the periods specified in the graphs. When there was a dated reference to a temple, it was counted as existing during that period. Dated references were of two kinds: the first were references to specific events, such as repairs or additions to the structure; the second were the listings of temples as extant at the time the gazetteer was compiled. When there was one full period or more between one dated reference and the next, the temple was assumed to have been in existence during the inter- vening period or periods. When a temple was reported to have been destroyed, it was counted as having existed in the period in question, but not in any subsequent period until the year or period in which it was rebuilt. In the graphs below, the "estimated" numbers were arrived at by multiplying by 30 the numbers counted in the sampled places. They therefore approximate the numbers that could be expected if the temples in gazetteers of all the counties and subprefectures in the imperial encyclopaedia had been used instead of the 1/30 sample. 31 29 This number exceeds one thirtieth of 1,544 (which would be 51.5) because of rounding up in sampling some of the provinces. When the sampled unit was a prefecture, data was extracted from units on two administrative levels: official temples at the prefectural rank (e.g. temples in the prefectural school) were included together with all the temples in the county which had its administrative seat within the prefectural city. Where more than one county had its seat in the prefectural city, only the first one listed in the source was selected. 30 For titles and dates of compilation of the gazetteers, see the appended list. 31 It should be noted, however, that the number of local government units</page><page sequence="14"> . - :E: :. . +z..ze : s::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ::: :, :::, ., ,,,, y .,,: :d,::, ....... r.,.:: :, ,, g-,,,,o,.,,,.,.,:,p, ig,.,,,,8 ", ,:,,:,,,.a, .-.-.'

But even within this modest number, fewer than fifteen thousand for the entire empire, or an average of nine per county, some changes may be discerned. Basic data extracted from gazetteers for the sampled counties is provided in six graphs, two for each of three categories.

The mere numbers of county altars and temples of the prescribed sets were fixed by law and are not a good measure of the importance attached to them by the local officials and the local population. The recorded projects may, by contrast, indi- cate actual levels of public and private investment. All Altars and Temples Taking the three sets of graphs together, it is apparent that the estimated numbers of the altars, shrines and temples of the uni- versal cults of the official religion grew steadily over the Ming and Qing. The altars increased four-fold from 1,320 to 5,070; the school temples also increased four-fold, from 1,500 to 5,880; and the popular-official temples, six-fold, from 540 to 3,210. Alto- gether, they increased fourfold from 3,360 (more than two per county) to 14,160 (about nine per county). The reported rates of building and repair show a somewhat different pattern. For the altars, there was a marked decline of 22% from Ming to Qing, from nine per year to seven. For the school temples there was an increase of 50% from 18 to 27. For the popular-official temples, there was a nearly twofold in- crease from ten to nineteen. The total number of projects per year for all three groups increased by 43%, from thirty-seven to fifty-three. From an over-all comparison of the three pairs of graphs, cer- tain similarities are apparent. The numbers of recorded sites rose steadily to a peak in the eighteenth century, except for the popu- lar-official temples, which peaked in the nineteenth. Again, in all three sets, construction activity peaked in the Hongwu (1468- 1398) and Yongzheng (1723-1735) reigns, except for the popular- official sites, where the Qing peak came in the late nineteenth century. Altars Graphs la and lb present combined data for the four standard altars. The first graph shows the estimated numbers of altars extant in the empire at any time during each period. Most of the altars reported for Song and Yuan were soil and grain altars; a few were those for wind, cloud, thunder and rain. The second graph</page><page sequence="17">OFFICIAL ALTARS, TEMPLES AND SHRINES 109 shows the estimated numbers of datable building and repair projects reported in each period.32 The numbers reported for Song and Yuan were probably un- derstated by Ming and Qing compilers working with inadequate records. The surge in numbers in the Hongwu reign reflects in about equal measure the building or rebuilding to new standards of the sheji tan, and the mandatory construction of abandoned ghost altars (li tan) in every county. This activity is reflected in the second graph, and is exceeded only by that in the Yongzheng reign. During the succeeding period of civil war and pacification (1399-1424), construction was largely suspended. Activity, in the form of repair and rebuilding, was resumed during the eight reigns from 1425-1521, and increased again during the Jiajing reign (1522-1566). The 50% increase in the reported numbers extant in 1425-1566, shared equally among the three kinds of altar, may have been partly an artifact of the sources; most were simply listed for the first time, and not necessarily newly built during the period. The longest period of inactivity was that from 1620-1723. This was followed in the Yongzheng reign by the most intense activity recorded for the entire Ming-Qing period. This mainly reflected the rapid construction of the First Farmer altars (xiannong tan), mandated in 1726. Over the four reigns from 1796 to 1874, a modest decline in the numbers of altars reported extant is accompanied by a steady decline in building activity. Moreover, a long-term comparison of building data shows a decline from Ming to Qing. School Temples Large numbers of schools, with their temples for Confucius (Wenmiao), are reported in the gazetteers for Song and Yuan, with enough in the latter dynasty to provide one each for more than three fourths of the counties. Fifteen hundred in all (esti- mated from the sampled counties), virtually a full complement, were reported in the Hongwu reign. Founding years are provided for 930. Of these, 810 were reported to have been built before 1368 (90 in Tang, 600 in Song, and 120 more in Yuan.) Of the remaining 690 extant in Hongwu, 120 were reported to have been founded in that reign. The founding years of the remaining 570 are not recorded. 32 Recall that the estimated numbers are the numbers in the fifty-three sam- pled counties multiplied by thirty.</page><page sequence="18">110 ROMEYN TAYLOR The high level of building and repair activity in Hongwu, there- fore, reflects the work of rebuilding and repairing existing schools to bring them into conformity with the new standards. This work was dramatically slowed during the civil war. During the succeeding period 1425-1566, the numbers of school temples increased sharply. This was the consequence of the construction of the shrines for the revered sages, famous officials and local worthies. Over the same period, activity during 1425-1521 more than doubled from the civil war years, and more than doubled again during 1522-1566, when the new shrines were being added. This work continued into the next period, 1567-1619, as more schools were provided with these three kinds of shrine. Warfare and disorders contributed to the destruction of about a third of the schools during c. 1628-1683. This coincided with high and rising levels of rebuilding and repair during the Shunzhi and Kangxi reigns (1644-1722). The construction of the shrines of the Loyal, Righteous, Filial and Brotherly, and of those of the Chaste and Dutiful in most of the schools during 1723- 1735 was reflected in the highest recorded levels of school temple construction work for either dynasty. Building and repair declined thereafter until another sharp decrease during the rebellions of the third quarter of the nine- teenth century, when about a quarter of the schools were de- stroyed by contending forces. Popular-Official Temples Until the addition of Guan Yu to the sidian uiAe in 1725, the city gods were the only deities in this class. They are reported in modest numbers for the Song and Yuan. Twice in the first Ming reign, the liturgy for this cult was substantially revised, with cor- responding changes in the design of the temples. This, and new construction, accounts for most of the high level of activity during the Hongwu reign. The addition of Guan Yu in 1725 doubled the numbers of temples of this class, and the addition of Wenchang in 1801 increased them again by half. Implications Texts accompanying the temple inventories in the gazetteers often contribute to an understanding of the quantified data with respect to govermental relations between center and periphery,</page><page sequence="19">OFFICIAL ALTARS, TEMPLES AND SHRINES 1ll and of the significance of the confrontation of official and popu- lar religion at the county level. Altars An edict of 1732 charged the local officials with having failed to maintain the altars and perform the rites properly. It said in part: The sacrificial statutes are of the utmost importance. [But] from the time when the officials first built [the altars], they regarded [the statutes] as mere paper and the regulations as not having to be car- ried out in their entirety. As the years passed [the structures] in some places gradually collapsed in ruin and it was not thought nec- essary to repair them. Thus [the officials] walked away from their re- sponsibility. The designs proper to the prefectural and county altars are abridged and the ceremonies are coarse and abbreviated. This shows disrespect for the idea of sacrificial offerings.33 The edict went on to order that the local officials be provided with the correct liturgical rules and the standard plans for the altars. More edicts followed in 1739, 1743 and 1757.34 The edicts may have had some effect: about three hundred altars were repaired or rebuilt from 1733-1760, or about ten per year, but in the 125 years after this, only 180 projects were re- ported, fewer than two per year. All of this points to a tension between orthodox doctrine, con- sistently affirmed and reaffirmed by the gazetteer compilers and reenforced by imperial edicts, and the allegedly perfunctory or negligent performance on the part of the local officials. School Temples On the evidence of the gazetteers, in marked contrast with the case of the altars, the local officials and gentry were more than willing to invest in their school temples throughout the Ming and Qing. A reason for this may be found in the fact that the rites in school temples not only served the disinterested cause of making the Way prevail in the world, but they were also tied to the voca- tional interests of the ruling class. There were two conspicuous indications of this narrower interest. The first was the presence of shrines for the cults of Wenchang and the closely allied cult of Kuixing OA, in the school campuses, even though they were sus- 33 Quoted in Lean xianzhi, 17:2a. 34 Qing shi 84, p. 1060; 85, p. 1063.</page><page sequence="20">112 ROMEYN TAYLOR pected of fostering heterodox practices. The second is seen in the many references in the gazetteers to the use of fengshui JRiA in an attempt to gain better success in the examinations for the students. A case in point is provided by the Shaanxi Province gazetteer of 1735: The Yongshou AK county school was rebuilt east of the present of- fices by magistrate Zhang Kun 4KM in 1669. Literary culture had not prospered in this city for a long time. This was why Zhang Kun laid his plans for building the school. After carefully searching eve- rywhere, 35 he obtained two mu of land located in the northeast an- gle of the city wall. He assembled the workmen and found the mate- rials. In 1669 he announced the completion of the work. He led the masters and students in the rites of celebration, when suddenly an auspicious glow filled the bridge-gate and auspicious magpies assem- bled on the Hall of Great Achievement. No one failed to raise his hand to his brow in salutation. This year local students Ren Shou { and Luo Wanjie WXM both succeeded in the examinations. The achievement of building this school thus had proved to be a great affair.36 Although the local gentry were generous in their support of the official schools, liturgical issues did arise between them and the central authorities over practices that were criticized as non- classical. By the beginning of Ming, the representation of spirits of the cult of Confucius and his disciples by images and their investiture with titles of nobility were established practices, but as early as the Hongwu reign it was proposed to reform the cult by replacing the images with tablets and divesting the spirits of their titles. The proposal was rejected at the time,37 but it was revived in the Jiajing reign. After extended discussion,38 a thoroughgoing reform was decreed which included the destruction of the images and their replacement with simple wooden tablets, and the elimi- nation of the spirits' titles of nobility. Another school issue concerned the popular cult of Wen- chang. Invested by imperial authority at least from the eighth century, and officially acknowledged as ruler of literary and offi- cial destinies at least from the eleventh century, the spirit had 35 The magistrate used divination in his search.

Official patronage even in the imperial capital apparently lapsed in early Ming. Al- though his temple in the capital was restored in the Jingtai reign (1450-1456), two other temples were closed down in the Cheng- hua reign (1465-1487). In closing one of them in Zhejiang, the magistrate said: The students recite formulae (song/a MiS) and pray to Wenchang for good fortune. Could there be a greater source of corruption than this?39 In the other case, a magistrate in Huguang closed a Wenchang temple that had been built on the school campus just ten years earlier and converted it into a shrine for local worthies.40 Despite his presence in many county schools at least from the late Ming, Wenchang was included in the sidian only in 1801. Critics had alleged that the cult, essentially Daoist, was a synthetic cult of diverse origins, including cults proper to Sichuan and an ancient astral cult.41 A memorial calling for the comprehensive reform of the sacrificial statutes was appproved in 1488.42 One of its recommendations was for the destruction of all the Wenchang school temples, leaving only the regional guardian cult temples in Sichuan. Wenchang's scholar devotees seem to have won the day, however, because the gazetteers offer no evidence of any temples having been destroyed as a result of the reforms. Wenchang's re- putation with the Ming and Qing imperial regimes cannot have been improved by the appropriation of his cult in Sichuan by the late Ming rebel leader Zhang Xianzhong @ Y. At least one other attempt was made to suppress the cult as heterodox in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century, and this too appears to have had little or no practical result.44 Popular-Official Cults One question that may be asked about the relation between official and popular religion is whether popular cults were added to the official pantheon after they had become widely popular, or 39 Ninghai' xi'anzhi z', (1892), 4:1lla-lIlb. 40 Gujin tushu jicheng, ce 152, p. 38. 41 Kleeman, op. cit., p. 459. 42 Summarized in Xia Xie 11, Ming Tong/ian A (1870, reprint ed., Taibei, 1962) 36, p. 1378. 4 Kleeman, pp. 96-100. 44 Kleeman, p. 101.</page><page sequence="22">114 ROMEYN TAYLOR whether they became widely popular because they had been added to the pantheon.

Some light may be shed upon this question by the numbers of temples of such cults that were recorded in the gazetteers as existing before and after the cults became mandatory in all the counties, and by comparing the numbers of official and lay tem- ples of these cults. Did the presence of an official temple in the county seat com- monly inspire emulation in the surrounding neighborhoods and villages? In the case of the spirits of walls and moats, clearly it did not. The ratio of lay to official temples at its highest point, in 1796-1850, was only about one to five.45 This low ratio may be explained by the fact that in the popular religion, as in the offi- cial, the spirits of walls and moats occupied a place in the spir- itual hierarchy corresponding to the county seat in the visible world, and had the same territorial jurisdiction. The establish- ment of Chenghuang temples in the villages, then, would have violated the order of both hierarchies, the spiritual and the mundane. It is more likely that when the cult was written into the Ming statutes in 1370, the effect was to confer official status upon an important segment of popular practice, with a thin disguise of legal orthodoxy veiling its popular character in order to protect the classical core of the official religion from the imputation that it had succumbed to corruption by the popular cult. The official cult of Guan Yu presents a very different case. There were imperially supported temples in both capitals throughout the Ming, and in the imperial capital in the Qing, and there was a temple by his tomb in Dangyang county, Hu- guang Province, from 1467.46 And ever grander ranks and epi- thets were bestowed upon the spirit by a succession of edicts from late Ming to late Qing. The popular cult kept pace, expanding west, north and south from the eastern provinces until by the end of the Ming it was found in every region except, perhaps, for the extreme southwest. The total numbers of temples, official and lay, grew by 60% between the periods 1567-1619 and 1620-1723, and by nearly 120% between 1620-1722 and 1723-1795. These rapid increases followed the investiture of Guan Yu with the title of 4 For reported lay temples of the universal cults, see Graph 4. 46 Li Yuancai fIii, comp., Xuxiu Dangyang xianzhi gjNZW;, (1889), 8:1b.</page><page sequence="24">116 ROMEYN TAYLOR "emperor" in 1614, and the promulgation of the revised liturgy to the counties in 1725. These numbers are consistent with the as- sumption that official status in this case did support expansion of the popular cult. If expansion of the popular cult had been the intended result of establishing the official cult in the cities, one might expect the gazetteer compilers to take pride in the numbers of lay temples. This was not the case, however; their tone was generally dis- aproving or dismissive. An 1883 county gazetteer in the metro- politan province said: All the villages, small and large, and all the towns have established [Guandi temples]. Most of these, however, do not conform to the official liturgy, and are not listed here.47 In Shandong, [Other Guandi temples] are built in the street intersections of every village and at every country crossroads. This is disrespectful and un- seemly. It would not be fitting to list them in detail.48 In Shaanxi, finally, another compiler concluded an essay on corrupt popular nomenclature saying: I have in the usual way designated this temple as the 'Guandi miao,' and ranked it with the exalted sacrifices. I honor the dynastic laws, and cast out popular notions.49 The cult of Wenchang, as we have seen, flourished in the face of official indifference at the highest levels, or even hostility, during the Ming and much of the Qing. His official cult was established at least at the county level in 1801, and he was in- vested with the title "Imperial Ruler in Charge of Literary Desti- nies, Revered Sage and Exposer of Heresies." The occasion was his success in repelling a bandit army in Sichuan the year before in his martial persona as Zitong.50 Although this title suggests conversion to protection of civil orthodoxy, not all of his temples were built in schools and academies; many stood atop the city walls, where the spirit could stand guard over his local constitu- ents. 47 Guo Chengxian It, comp., Daming fuzhi *ffR* (1853), 6:13b. 48 Yucheng xianzhi, 4:8b. 49 Yongshou xianzhi, 5:32b. 50 Qing shi 85, p. 1070.</page><page sequence="25">OFFICIAL ALTARS, TEMPLES AND SHRINES 117 Conclusions The Ming founder took great pains to reform the religious life of the empire, with particular attention to the official religion. He and the commissions he appointed for the task were concerned for the authenticity of the rites. All had to be rooted in "classics and history," and all excesses were to be pruned back. Of our set of thirteen universal cults mandated to all counties, only five were mandated in the Hongwu reign. Four of these continued or re- vived classical rites. The altars to soil and grain (counted as one), and to wind, cloud, thunder and rain, local mountains and rivers (counted as one), were indisputably classical in origin, and clas- sical precedents could be found for the revived rites for the aban- doned ghosts. The offerings to Confucius were clearly "classical" both because of their respectable antiquity, and because of the prominence of the cult of Confucius in the imperial ideology. The non-classical exception was the cult of the spirits of walls and moats. The popular origins and character of this cult were dis- guised, albeit ineffectively, by their reclassification with the moun- tains and rivers as spirits of the natural landscape. The "classical core" was enlarged in the sixteenth century by the addition of the three shrines for the revered sages, famous local officials, and local worthies. Thus at the end of the Ming, seven of eight uni- versal official cults still demonstrably had classical antecedents. Of the five cults added in the Qing, the local offerings to Xiannong in association with the spring plowing rite clearly had classical precedents.51 Two more school shrines, one for the loyal, righteous and filial, and one for the chaste and dutiful, further extended the cult of Confucius. But two others, Guan Yu and Wenchang, were at odds with the classical character of the core cults. Guan Yu was immensely popular as a warrior hero and as patron of merchants. Wenchang was a prominent member of the Daoist pantheon and, in one of his personae, a martial figure. As in the earlier case of the official attempt to redefine the cult of the spirits of walls and moats, the attempt to fix the definition of the Guan Yu and Wenchang cults-the one as a paradigm of conventional virtues, and the other as the patron of literature and defender of ideological orthodoxy-gave them a color of legiti- macy, but may have had little effect on their popular character. 51 LiJi, tr. Couvreur, v. 2, p. 101.</page><page sequence="26">118 ROMEYN TAYLOR If the inclusion of Chenghuang, Guandi and Wenchang among the universal official cults presented a problem for the orthodoxy of the official religion, why, it may be asked, were they included at all? A much closer examination of the "politics" of these meas- ures is needed. It was not necessarily a calculated stratagem of "cooptation." Ming Taizu first mandated the local Chenghuang temples and liturgy in their traditional anthropomorphic form, but almost immediately reformed them as a pseudo-classical cult. Was this in response to official disapproval of this essentially popular cult, and was it in the first instance a project dear to the founder personally? Was Guan Yu a particular favorite of the Qing ruling house even before their occupation of the northern capital of the Ming? And what may have been the position of classically-oriented ritual experts regarding the extraordinary consideration shown to this spirit? If official endorsement of popular or Daoist cults was a strategy of cultural control, why was a cult such as that of the Dark Warrior that was cherished by the Ming ruling house not mandated universally? The gazetteers do not encourage the view that all of this is to be explained by the intervention of the "state" as deus ex machina. The compilers often note receipt of reform edicts, but on their evidence it does not appear that all the reforms were ever carried out. Rather, this narrative points to a social process in the back- ground: the formation and perpetuation of social hierarchy. What is remarkable is not that the classical core of the official religion appears increasingly to have been under siege after the Hongwu reformation, but that it survived at all and in some re- spects even showed robust growth. Even the classical altar rites, which sometimes appear to have been moribund at the county level, survived in some fashion well into the nineteenth century, while the school temples flourished. In the face of the powerful attraction of the vibrant popular religion, to which they often succumbed for their own reasons, the literati-official ruling class generously nurtured the cult of Confucius, their tutelary spirit, and with notably less enthusiasm, even maintained the ancient altar rites. Whether consciously or not, they continued to do what was necessary to differentiate themselves from their social inferi- ors.</page><page sequence="27">OFFICIAL ALTARS, TEMPLES AND SHRINES 119 Gazetteers used for sampled counties A.
