Miller Indiana University "The icon and the idol determine two manners of being . . . not two classes of beings.'4 Ш Evil's Conundrum Early in Confessions, Augustine offers two conceptual frameworks for understanding evil.2 One account provides a psychological explanation, focusing on the will's excessive attachment to earthly goods in its anxious desire to secure a permanent mooring in the sea of time and circumstance. According to Augustine, evil arises when we seek to overcome our fundamental lack as mortal creatures Thanks to colleagues and students for comments on a previous draft of this article: Nigel Biggar, Sidney Callahan, Eric Gregory, Stanley Hauerwas, Darà Hill, Paul Lauritzen, Nancy Levene, Margaret Mohrmann, Sara O'Donnell, Charles Pinches, Jeff Poole, Bharat Ranganathan, Lisa Sideris, Aaron Stalnaker, and the readers and editors of the Harvard Theological Review. 1 Jean-Luc Marion, God without Being (trans. Thomas A. Carlson, with an intro. by David Tracy; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991) 8. 2 In what follows I depart from Charles Mathewes's interpretation of Augustine's account of evil. For Mathewes, Augustine organizes his concepts of evil around the notions of privation of being and perversion of human nature. I concur with Mathewes regarding the first but not the second point, focusing as I do on Augustine's view of evil's origins. Perversion of human nature describes Augustine's account of the effect of evil and its secondary cause rather than its primal origin. See Charles T.

We confuse mutable for immutable goods, drawn as we are to objects of beauty that are finite and contingent in our restless quest for enduring happiness. In the process, we elevate the value of temporal goods to a status they neither deserve nor can sustain. Augustine understands that such desires are sinful because they are disordered. They fail to draw the correct measure in our commerce with the world and leave us unhappy and unsatisfied. Indeed, such pursuits of happiness are doomed to fail given that we have tethered our hopes to goods that are fated to decay.3 Our desires will remain unquenched and our sense of internal order will remain off-kilter insofar as we fail to draw delight and direction from God as the Supreme Good. Confused about the qualitative difference between eternity and time, between unchanging and changing goods, we attach our loves to gifts of death.4 In these terms Augustine concludes the first book of Confessions, after recounting his years of infancy and early youth: "In this lay my sin, that not in [God] was I seeking pleasures, distinctions, and truth, but in myself and in the rest of [God's] creatures, and so I fell headlong into pains, confusions, and errors."5 This picture of desire provides Augustine a psychological explanation for why humans commit wrongdoing, an explanation that seeks to defend divine justice against Manichaean criticisms of Christian beliefs. According to Augustine, humanity, not God, is to be held responsible for evil's existence in the world. Evil arises not from God's creation but from a will that turns away from God "and lapses into fornication"- an image that Augustine uses in Confessions to describe our defection from the Supreme Good in the quest to find happiness in more immediate and tangible realities.6 Desirous for security, anxious about mortality, we attach ourselves to temporal goods as if they were everlasting. We thereby turn the world into a theater of idols. Augustine famously complicates this psychological account with his story of the pears in Book 2 of Confessions. As an adolescent he conspired with friends to steal a neighbor's pears, a seemingly trivial act of vandalism7 to which Augustine attaches great significance. He wonders what could have motivated him to steal given that he had plenty of better pears immediately available to him. His answer only darkens the picture of evil that he has offered to that point in Confessions. He stole them for the sake of stealing itself. "There was no motive for my malice 3 See, e.g., The Confessions 4.6.11 (trans. Maria Boulding; Hyde Park, N.Y.: New City Press, 1997) 98.

MILLER 389 except malice,"8 Augustine admits, adding, "I feasted on the sin, nothing else."9 Other vices make motivational sense insofar as we seek out beauty in those acts, however counterfeit that beauty might be. But there was no beauty in stealing the pears- no good, the desire for which can explain the boys' theft. He asks, "To do what was wrong simply because it was wrong- could I have found pleasure in that?"10 His answer connects the act to a metaphysical nullity: "From that theft I found nothing to love." Not even the "shadowy beauty with which vice allures us" can explain his theft.11 To the idea that he loved not the theft but the camaraderie of those with whom he conspired, he sticks to this same point: The "gang-mentality too was a nothing."12 In that "unfriendly form of friendship," he confesses, "I was greedy for another's loss without any desire on my part to gain anything or to settle a score."13 It was deprivation- the privation of a good- and nothing more that drove Augustine and his friends to thievery. Explanations for such an action are wanting, as there was no substantive end to which the act could be aimed as a basis for moving the will.14 Augustine rather aspired to divine-like sovereignty and freedom, uncreated and non-contingent- independent of any rational end to which his conduct might give account. He sought arbitrary liberty, liberty whose exercise was his alone to authorize. A narrative about what seems like a minor sin thus provides a conceptual window into evil's deeper mystery. For Augustine, the ground of arbitrary, unmotivated evil in the will is a surd, dark and inaccessible, mute and irrational.15 It is approachable by way of querying and approximation but it finally defies human categories of psychological understanding.16 It is tempting to conclude that Augustine is either confused or equivocal about the relation between evil and human agency because he seems not to care about resolving the tensions between his explanatory and non-reductive accounts. The tension consists in an account of evil as motivated, prompted, and (improperly) 8 Ibid., 2.4.9. Augustine's theft would be classified by medieval thinkers as a "sin of malice." For Aquinas, no less than for Augustine, such a sin raises complex motivational questions. See Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, 1-2, Q. 78.

When trying to explain how the first sin occurred, Augustine concludes that Adam and Eve sinned "in secret."

Understood within the sweep of Confessions, however, the pear scene works less to overturn Augustine's psychological explanation than to segue into his second main account of evil, his ontological account, which he introduces in Book 3. Understood ontologically, evil is a deficiency, a diminishment of good. Here we detect resonances between the ontology of evil and Augustine's non-reductive claim that the theft of pears and the gang-mentality of his friends were each "a nothing." When we philosophize about evil in relation to "that which is" rather than in relation to human agency or "reasons for action," Augustine avows, we are to conceive of it in terms of the diminishment of being. Here, too, Manichaean ideas provide a foil. When recalling his discussions with the Manichees about the origin of evil, Augustine notes that his efforts were frustrated by a picture of a deity that was "confined to a material form with hair and nails."17 Tellingly, Augustine adds that a worldview "restricted to seeing material shapes with my eyes and imaginary forms in my mind"18 left him with "no inkling of what there could be in us which would give grounds for saying that we are made in the image of God."19 More to the point, the idea of an anthropomorphic god offered no room for notions of immateriality and infinity, "present everywhere, as a spirit is, and as God is," as found in Platonic and Christian philosophy. A metaphysic understood as including immateriality and infinity enabled Augustine to conceive of evil not as some part of creation or as some substance that a material deity once fashioned. Rather, Augustine came to define evil as an absence, a privano boni. He writes: "Evil is nothing but the diminishment of good to the point where nothing at all is left."20 How to harmonize these two accounts of evil, the psychological and the onto- logical, is not obvious. Augustine's psychological view seems not to track his ontological view; excess and deficiency describe altogether different manifestations of evil in the world. In general, his psychological experience of desire seems disconnected from his philosophical theory of being- no small problem for a memoir that seeks to make sense of history and experience in light of the reasons behind them.21 Regarding the topic of evil, this detachment borders on alienation. We are presented with metaphors that identify evil affections according to opposite extremes: inordinate love that is, at the same time, a kind of vacancy. In The City of God, Augustine speaks to this point when he describes Adam's defection from God as "like trying to see darkness or to hear silence."22 17 Augustine, Confessions 3.7.12. 18 Ibid. 19 Ibid., 3.6.12. 20 Ibid. 21 The point is put forcefully by Colin Starnes, Augustine 's Conversion: A Guide to the Argument of Confessions I-IX (Waterloo, Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1990) xii. 22 Augustine, City of God 12.7.</page><page sequence="5">RICHARD B. MILLER 391 Hence evil's conundrum: Can we coherently say that we indeed love darkness and silence in our excessive attachment to light and sound, to color and melody? Augustine himself articulates this question when he asks, "Who can observe things that are lacking?"23 I want to explore this conundrum24 not in the abstract but as it helps to launch inquiry into Augustine's understanding of desire, friendship, and alteri ty in Confessions. I do so not out of an idiosyncratic interest but because Augustine himself invites us down this path by turning from his discussions of evil in Confessions 1-3 to the story of the death of an unnamed childhood friend in Book 4. Augustine narrates his feelings in response to this death as if he wants us not to untangle the inner tensions of the conundrum of evil but to grasp its potential to speak in religious and philosophical terms about friendship, moral psychology, and the epistemic aspects of virtue. During this phase of his life, Augustine's world was populated by idols, created by an anthropocentric imaginary, and driven by self- love known as cupiditas.25 Reflections on death and friendship resume in response to a second significant death, that of Monica, narrated in Book 9. Here Augustine revisits love and the affections within a theocentric imaginary, one that leads him to re-poetize friendship and to grieve in ways that express an altogether different emotional repertoire. At this later point in his life, he mourns in ways that are iconic rather than idolatrous, motivated by a love of neighbor informed by caritas. An iconic, theocentric imaginary enables him to perceive mutable goods neither as temptations to excess nor as vessels of nullity but as disclosively real and truly other. In what follows I will show how Augustine's conundrum of evil exposes the intertwining of psychological and ontological aspects of the materialist relation to the world and the narcissistic orientation to his friends that chracterized his late adolescence and early adult life. For Augustine, narcissism and idolatry are two sides of the same coin, forged together by the self as the reference point for conceiving of both God and neighbor. What is basic about such loves is that, as forms of projection, they cannot point beyond themselves to something more, only to something less. But Augustine will leave us with more than a judgment about how not to love in Confessions. He will contrast the world view he possessed as a Manichean with his ability, informed by a Platonized Christianity, to perceive mutable goods iconically. When viewed in this way, sensible phenomena point beyond themselves to enduring principles that secure temporal reality's objectivity and alteri ty, making that reality 23 Ibid. 24 The conundrum I am addressing differs from that which William S. Babcock explores. He focuses on Augustine's explanation of how evil can arise from a good will. See Babcock, "Augustine on Sin and Moral Agency," 107. 25 1 use the word "imaginary" here, following Charles Taylor's locution of a "social imaginary," to focus on the way people imagine their surroundings, which is "often not expressed in theoretical terms, but is carried in images, stories, legends."

Anticipating a theme of Iris Murdoch, Augustinián ethics emphasizes the importance of seeing reality as it is rather than as one wishes.26 As I will show, in Confessions Augustine represents caritas, iconicity, and heterology as mutually supportive facets of mind and will. In a universe viewed iconically rather than idolatrously, mutable goods point beyond their surface beauty to objective values according to which they find meaning and provide order and direction to human affections. Desires can thereby become indexed against an order of things that is independent of human wishes and constructions. This order of things can serve to determine whether our desires, inexorably arising from the soul, are indeed desirable. Noting that Augustine acquires what Donald Evans calls a different "onlook" 27 can help us understand Augustine's conversion from cupiditas to caritas. According to Evans, an onlook is a matter of looking "on x as ;y."28 Having an onlook differs from having an opinion or abstract conceptualization of x' an onlook entails more than having a "perspective" on x. Onlooks rather involve us by way of feeling, posture, commitment, vision, and intentionality. Evans proposes five features of an onlook: 1) it is "commissive," reflecting a policy or an expression of intention; 2) it is autobiographical, involving the self both behaviorally and attitudinally; 3) it is expressive of feelings, which are logically connected to the words and ideas that shape an onlook; 4) it involves a posture toward the world- it is not neutral or detached; and 5) it has a "verdictive" component, such that looking "on x as /' means "placing x within a structure, organization, or scheme."29 For Evans, the commissive and verdictive aspects of an onlook are especially important. "In saying 'I look on x as v,'" he writes, "I commit myself to a policy of behavior and thought, and I register my decision that x is appropriately described as y ; my utterance combines an undertaking with a judgment. . . . One undertakes to do certain things, viewing them or interpreting them in a certain way."30 Augustine's conversion meant acquiring an onlook that saw the world in a way that was freed from his narcissistic tendency to assimilate it to himself- as if the world could be conceived (like a material deity) in his own image. In his early years, Augustine's relation to the world is self-referring in a pejorative sense. Caritas brings in its wake an onlook toward the world in its alterity and, with that, its independent goodness. That gift of otherness, along with its ethical implications, is made plain in Augustine's recollection of Monica's death in Book 9, for which the death of his childhood friend serves as clear contrast in Confessions' narrative. 26 Iris Murdoch, The Sovereignty of Good (London: Ark Paperbacks, 1970). 27 Donald D.

MILLER 393 Developing these claims and the connections between cupiditas, idolatry, and narcissism will require several steps. That discussion will prepare us to see how Augustine triangulates caritas, iconicity, and heterology as graced dispositions of the mind and will- as describing what it means to love one's neighbor "in God." These ideas will also generate insights about vision, friendship, and virtue to which I will direct our attention. Augustine's grievous responses to the deaths of his friends provide a window into his more general understanding of what counts as real and how the virtuous mind and will recondition his onlook toward the world and his understanding of the self-other relationship. That is to say, his moments of grief point to different modes of feeling and friendship as well as to an epistemology of the real, the latter of which is often construed reductively in Augustinián ethics. I will seek to nuance that account before concluding. To explore those points, let us turn to Augustine's account of love, loss, and grief as he first describes them in Confessions. Ш Cupiditas у Idolatry, and Narcissism Augustine initially describes his unnamed friend in Book 4 not in terms of particularities or peculiarities that mark him off as a distinct individual but in terms of the two friends' similarities. Indeed, the fact that Augustine fails to mention his friend's name- a signifier of individuation- is telling. De-particularized, the young man's res lacks a signum. The two men mirror each other in body, age, and outlook; what was important for Augustine was his friend's likeness, not his difference. The two shared the fact that they were "intellectually astray," agreeing about matters of superstition and myth on the basis of Augustine's persuasive rendering of Manichean ideas. But their friendship, while including a measure of unity and affection, fell short of "true friendship," in which people are bound fast in charity.31 Here we see echoes of Augustine's earlier concerns about an "unfriendly form of friendship" of the sort that he mentioned in Book 2. What appears to make such bonding possible in Augustine's mind during this stage of his life is mimesis- the apparent identity of difference, the mutuality of self-imaging. Indeed, the two young men's similarity is intense; their friendship is less a bonding of two distinct persons than an absorption of two souls into one, a reduction of identity- both personal and numerical. Augustine writes: "I felt that my soul and his had been but one soul in two bodies."32 Their relationship mimics 31 Augustine, Confessions 4 A.I. 32 Ibid., 4.6.11. O'Donnell rightly identifies the parallel between this passage and Augustine's description of his friendship with his mother (more on this below). See James J. O'Donnell, "The Confessions of St. Augustine: Book 4," n.p. [cited October 2009] . Online: http://www.stoa.org/hippo/ frames4.html. There is a difference, however, between Augustine feeling "that my soul and his had been but one soul in two bodies" (describing his friendship with his unnamed friend, above) and experiencing friendship in terms of having "one life, woven out of mine and hers" (Confessions 9.12.30, describing his friendship with his mother, Monica). Augustine's first formulation, "unam fuisse animam in duobus corporibus" (had been but one soul in two bodies) comes from Ovid's</page><page sequence="8">394 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW in reverse the idea of Christ as two natures in one person; theirs is an inverted Christology, a parody of loss and exaltation. Equally important, the two friends are starkly co-dependent. "My soul could not bear to be without him," Augustine writes; at his friend's bedside, "I did not leave him, so closely we were dependent on each other."33 Augustine "shrank from life with loathing," because the idea of his friend's death left him with the unendurable consequence of being "only half alive."34 For these reasons, the idea of difference- and, with that, objectivity and indi viduation- left Augustine deeply addled. When confronted by his friend's apparent embrace of Christianity after being baptized in a state of unconsciousness , Augustine felt "aghast and troubled" by his friend's "new found independence."35 Augustine deferred telling his friend his true thoughts about his baptism on the premise that "once he was in normal health again I would be able to do what I liked with him."36 Augustine's grief at the passing of his friend was considerable. "I was beset by misery and bereft of my joy," he writes. "I was miserable, and miserable too is everyone whose mind is chained by friendship with mortal things, and is torn apart by their loss, and then becomes aware of that misery that it was even before it lost them."37 His grief's lack of order smacks of the inordinate value he attached to earthbound goods. But exactly what Augustine grieved and how his grief arose from a wider repertoire of emotions are not obvious. Plainly, it was not the loss of the friend that distressed him. His grief was diffuse and self-indulgent. He confesses that it was not out of hope that his friend would "come back" that he mourned. It was rather the tide of emotion itself on which Augustine centered his being. "Weeping alone brought me solace," he writes; sorrow substituted for his friend "as the only comfort of my soul."38 He experienced a loss of self in his sadness, a profound sense of despair. "I wept bitterly and found repose in the bitterness," he admits.39 A species of cupiditas, Augustine's grief had himself as his object. Augustine's mourning became melancholia, driven not (as Freud would have it) by internalized self-reproach but by obsessive narcissism and myopia. On Freud's account, mourning is a feeling of sadness and distress upon the experience of loss. Freudian melancholia is more: It is a pathological expression of mourning- the internalization of dejection such that the grieving person experiences a radical, punishing loss of self-esteem. "The distinguishing mental features of melancholia," description of the friendship between Orestes and Py lades (referenced in Confessions 4.6.11). The latter account defines Augustine's life and relationship with Monica subsequent to his conversion, described as "vita, quae una facta erat ex mean et illius" (one life, woven out of mine and hers). 33 Augustine, Confessions 4.4.7. 34 Ibid., 4.6.11. 35 Ibid., 4.4.8. 36 Ibid. 37 Ibid., 4.1.10. 38 Ibid., 4.4.9. 39 Ibid., 4.6.11.</page><page sequence="9">RICHARD B. MILLER 395 Freud writes, "are a profoundly painful dejection, abrogation of interest in the outside world, loss of the capacity to love, inhibition of all activity, and a lowering of the self-regarding feelings to a degree that finds utterance in self-reproaches and self-re vilings, and culminates in a delusional expectation of punishment."40 Freudian melancholies believe that they deserve the grievous state they are in. They blame the victim- themselves. But Augustine does not blame himself for his friend's death. Rather, he experienced his friend's death passively, as if death had visited him. That feature of Augustine's response mirrored the Manichean god in whom he believed- a deity whose goodness was, in the words of Peter Brown, "singularly passive and ineffective."41 Augustine's dejection prompted a new level of self-examination, crucial to his narrative's forward movement. In the wake of his friend's death, he writes, "I had become a great enigma to myself, and I questioned my soul, demanding why it was so sorrowful and why it so disquieted me."42 He found one answer in his psychological account of evil, focusing as it does on excessive attachments to earthbound loves. It was his friend "whom I loved as though he would never die, and still more amazed that I could go on living myself when he was dead- I who had been like another self to him."43 So he exclaims: "Woe to the madness that thinks to cherish human beings as though more than human!"44 From this confession Augustine turns in Book 4 to a discussion of beauty, about which he also wrote a non-extant treatise. "What is it that entices and attracts us to the things we love?" he asks. He answers that we are drawn to objects of beauty, understood as having beauty in themselves and in their relations to other things: "In material objects there was both a quality inherent in the whole- beauty- and a different quality that was seemly in something that was harmoniously adapted to something else, as a part of the body to the whole, or a sandal to the foot."45 Yet despite his ability to conceptualize a formal reality- the fact of harmony in relationships- Augustine could not grasp incorporeal reality as such; he "looked instead toward shapes and colors and distended mass."46 Given his experience of 40 Sigmund Freud, "Mourning and Melancholia," in General Psychological Theory (ed. Philip Rieff; New York: Touchstone Books, 1991) 164-79, at 165. For Freud, melancholies suffer from an excess of internalized self-reproach, the remedy for which is the lifting of the conscience, or superego, in order for the ego to adjust to the reality of loss. On that view, we can properly mourn when the overbearing voice of conscience is silenced and the ego can adjust to the reality of another's passing. For Augustine, the remedy to melancholia is likewise a function of the reality principle. However, that remedy is made possible not by the lifting of the conscience but by the transformation of the agent's onlook and priorities. 41 Peter Brown, Augustine of Hippo: A Biography (Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press, 1967) 52. 42 Augustine, Confessions 4.4.9. 43 Ibid., 4.6.11. 44 Ibid., 4.7.12. 45 Ibid., 4.13.20. 46 Ibid.</page><page sequence="10">396 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW peace as concord and vice as discord, he came to the conclusion that unity was the supreme good and "in disintegration some indefinable substance of irrational life was to be found, which was the essence of supreme evil."47 His conception of the deity, in turn, remained within an anthropocentric imaginary, unable to reckon with ideas in terms other than human. He thus addresses God, saying: "I was prepared even to think you changeable rather than to admit that I was not what you are. ... I persisted in walking after things that had no existence either in you or in me or in any creature, ideas not created for me by your truth but invented in material shape by my own vanity."48 Augustine's onlook toward sensible reality as described in Book 4 was idolatrous, understanding that term in more than the familiar sense of elevating temporal realities to the status of eternal goods. The notion of an idol also bespeaks an epistemology, a way of seeing. As Jean-Luc Marion writes, "The gaze makes the idol, not the idol the gaze."49 More specifically, as Margaret R. Miles observes, throughout his work Augustine presents us with two epistemologies regarding sensible reality, one that accepts sensible things as they present themselves to him, another that refuses to take their reality as given and looks beyond their surface appearance to probe their "structure, their essence, and the source of their existence."50 That is to say, with Augustine, as with Plato, everything depends on the terms according to which we receive and interrogate sensible reality. For Augustine, Miles notes, "a sensible object can be either a distraction or an indispensible starting point. Nothing about the object determines whether it will act as one or the other."51 At the heart of the distinction between an idolatrous epistemology and an iconic one is whether one accepts surface beauty as sufficient or whether one questions it to discern more enduring principles underlying it. "The idol absorbs the gaze, dazzling it and saturating it with the visible, ravishing it," Miles writes.52 It thereby contracts rather than expands the idolater's range and depth of vision. An idol is a res without an objective signum. The icon, in contrast, "summons the gaze to surpass itself by never freezing on the visible, since the visible only presents itself here in view of the invisible."53 In this way, the icon makes sensible reality available on terms that are not established by the observer's own desires or interests. In Book 10 of Confessions, Augustine illustrates how the iconic imagination works: And what is this? I put my question to the earth, and it replied, "I am not he"; I questioned everything it held, and they confessed the same. I questioned the sea and the great deep, and the teeming live creatures that crawl, and they 47 Ibid.

MILLER 397 replied, "We are not God; seek higher." ... To the sky I put my question, to sun, moon, and stars, but they denied me; "We are not the God you seek." And to all things which stood around the portals of my flesh, I said, "Tell me of my God. You are not he, but tell me something of him."54 Augustine asks these questions on certain epistemological assumptions. He presumes to determine the significance of sensible reality not by jettisoning that reality but by interrogating it and thereby discerning more fundamental facts about it. In this case, sensible reality discloses a difference between creation and creator, a fundamental distinction according to which the former points to how the latter creates and sustains that which is.55 Such are the illuminations of the iconic epistemology whereby the mind is summoned by sense perception to surpass itself. Augustine's discourse on beauty, desire, and the imagination in Book 4 reminds us that his theological ethics includes an aesthetic. That discourse, moreover, is connected to his preceding recollections regarding the death of his unnamed friend. Overwrought with despair, he admits to finding no repose in God "because when I thought about you [God], you did not seem to be anything solid or firm. For what I thought of was not you at all; an empty fantasy and my own error were my god."56 And so Augustine was unable to see the world as manifesting anything, as having any beauty. The world was empty of potential for hierophany. Full of his own desires, Augustine saw not presence but absence, a privation of that for which he looked. "My eyes sought [my beloved] everywhere," he writes, "but he was missing; I hated all things because they held him not, and could no more say to me, 'Look, here he comes!' as they had been wont to do in this lifetime when he had been away."57 Within a universe populated only by decaying goods, sensible reality becomes dark and incommunicative. Augustine thus confesses his first reaction to his friend's passing: "Black grief closed over my heart and wherever I looked I saw only death."58 Taken as a whole, Augustine's memory of friendship and death draws on both sides of evil's conundrum to illustrate the motivations lying behind his friendship along with the visual and emotional poverty to which it led. That is to say, his affection was marked by both excess and deficiency. Augustine is saying that these two concepts of evil, far from being opposite extremes, reinforce each other. Loving too much, according to Augustine, is not to love at all. On that basis Augustine can say that evil's dual manifestation indeed illumines rather than obscures his experience. 54 Augustine, Confessions 10.6.9. 55 On this distinction, see Robert Sokolowski, The God of Faith and Reason: Foundations of Christian Theology (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 1982). 56 Augustine, Confessions 4.12.12. 57 Ibid., 4.4.9. 58 Ibid.</page><page sequence="12">398 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW It is nonetheless tempting to think that Augustine's narrative of death and grief hews to only one side of evil's conundrum regarding this "unfriendly form of friendship." James Wetzel offers one such reading in his commentary on Book 4 of Confessions. On the one hand, Wetzel rightly observes that in Book 4 Augustine describes "having done his level best to love a mortal human being as if he were immortal and presumably divine." But to this point Wetzel adds: "The result is not that Augustine loved something of lesser value in place of something greater, but that he lost touch with the man he was loving and so had no way to take in the magnitude of his loss."59 Eric Gregory repeats this idea when he writes that Augustine confesses "not that he loved too much, but that he did not really love (either the world or God) at all."60 But these remarks fly in the face of Augustine's frank admission that he had loved his friend "as though he would never die"- cherishing "human beings as though more than human!"61 The contrast that Wetzel and Gregory present between loving a lesser value in place of something greater, and losing touch with one's beloved, is a false one. Augustine makes plain that his excessive attachment was driven by a desire to see his own image, to address his own needs on the premise that he and his friend were alike. That tendency drew from his habit of homologizing reality to himself, of projecting an anthropomorphic account of power and sovereignty onto the cosmos. As a consequence, he loved his friend as a private possession rather than as someone whose goodness could be shared. Here, echoes of the narrative of theft in Book 2 can be heard: Augustine first understood his friendship as something to be stolen and privately kept, depriving others of a basic goodness. In his desires as in his metaphysics, Augustine used himself as his reference point. As he wants to make plain throughout Confessions, how we love is a matter of the wider frameworks that shape the imagination. Augustine's youthful friendship had its own inner poverty, the inability to embrace another who was independent and beyond his control. Indeed, it is not clear that Augustine lost touch with his friend because it is not clear that his friend was ever available to him as something other than created in his own likeness. Here, Wetzel is correct to say that Augustine's failure to love his friend in God "left his friend to be the creature of Augustine's fears and desires."62 Augustine's point is that loving too much and loving not at all are paradoxically one and the same. He underscores that idea by confessing in Book 2 that he was left thinking not about how his beloved's passing meant the loss of someone who had an independent set of interests and promise but about what his friend's death meant for his self-absorbed 59 James Wetzel, "Book Four: The Trappings of Woe and Confession of Grief," in A Reader's Companion to Augustine's Confessions (ed.

MILLER 399 concerns about his own inescapable mortality. He admits to being "amazed that I could go on living myself when he was dead- I who had been like another self to him."63 Equally important, Augustine experiences his friend's death as the taking of a possession that he had previously stolen for himself. Echoing the pear scene, he reports that he was as much the object as the subject of theft: "I believe that the more that I loved him, the more I hated death, which had taken him from me; I hated it as a hideous enemy, and feared it, and pictured it as ready to devour all human beings, since it had been able to make away with him."64 ■ Loving the Neighbor "in God" Earlier I stated that Book 4 of Confessions stands in clear contrast with Book 9, in which Augustine recounts his feelings in response to the death of his mother, Monica. Book 9 tells us of the deaths of several friends: Monica, Verecundus, Nebridius, and his son, Adeodatus. Notably, Monica is named only once in Confessions, a signification that Augustine reserves for his prayers at the conclusion of this book.65 We can only speculate as to why Augustine refrains from reflecting at length on his friendships- a crucially important feature of his life66- until they cease. Starkly, strangely, Augustine frequently associates friendship with death. Perhaps friendship represents the most intimate kind of temporal good whose passing reveals the power of time over earthbound things- the subject of Augustine's probing philosophical analysis in Book 11 of Confessions. Perhaps friendship is too easily underwritten by eros, a love that becomes extinguished in its satisfaction.67 Perhaps, in a Heideggerian fashion, friendship is part of Augustine's being-in-the-world, only to be reflected upon when it is disrupted or taken away. Whatever might explain the association, it is impossible to ignore how death shadows intimate friendships throughout Augustine's memoir. In Book 9, Augustine, Monica, his brother, his friend Alypius, and others retire to a villa in Cassiciacum to live together. Their ideal was to form a community of Christian celibates. At this point in his life, Augustine slowly removes himself from his work as a rhetorician, after which time he is baptized, thereby redeeming his mother's prayers and patience. He tells of how his mother was a subservient wife, dutiful and capable of correction about matters of continence. Indeed, he goes to great lengths to describe her ordinariness and her sinfulness, a point to which I will soon return. 63 Augustine, Confessions 4.6.11 . 64 Ibid. 65 Following Boulding's edition, 236 n. 151. 66 "Augustine will never be alone," Brown observes while describing Augustine's early life.

The hierophany they experienced is prompted by their shared reflection about the communion of saints. They then launch their sojourn by discussing the great pleasures of eternal life as opposed to earthly existence. Augustine writes: Our colloquy led us to the point where the pleasures of the body's senses, however intense and in however brilliant a material light enjoyed, seemed un- worthy not merely of comparison but even of remembrance beside the joy of that life, and we lifted ourselves in longing yet more ardent toward That Which Is, and step by step traversed all bodily creatures and heaven itself, whence sun and moon and stars shed their light upon the earth. Higher still we mounted by inward thought and wondering discourse on your works, and we arrived at the summit of our own minds; and this too we transcended, to touch that land of never-failing plenty where you pasture Israel forever with the food of truth. Life there is the Wisdom through whom all these things are made, and all others that have been or ever will be; but Wisdom herself is not made: she is as she always has been and will be forever. Rather should we say that in her there is no "has been" or "will be," but only being, for she is eternal, but past and future do not belong to eternity. And as we talked and panted for it, we just touched the edge of it by the utmost leap of our hearts; then, sighing and unsatisfied, we left the first-fruits of our spirit captive there, and returned to the noise of articulate speech, where a word has beginning and end.68 Theirs is not a vision of the sort that Augustine describes in Book 7 of Confes- sions. There, Augustine ascends in Plotinian fashion from the experience of sensible objects to experiencing the condition of reflection itself, attaining "That Which Is in the flash of one tremulous glance."69 That epiphany was solitary and intellectual, and it brought no informational content. Equally important, Augustine was unable to hold fast to what he had attained, drawn back as he was to sensible experience by time and habit. Nor is the Ostian vision like Augustine's conversion epiphany in Book 8, which was mediated by the verbal communication of the word of God and included theological content but was mediated to him alone, in solitude. With Monica, Augustine's experience has less to do with light or hearing than with relative silence. And, of course, in this instance Augustine is not alone: He embarks on a journey with a fellow traveler. Together they imagine the tumult of human flesh, earthly life, human dreams, and the soul all falling silent, along with "every tongue, and every sign, and whatever is subject to transience." In that silence, he writes, "if anyone listens, all these things will tell him, 'We did not make ourselves, he made us who abides forever.'"70 Augustine and Monica are informed that they are dependent, not self-originating; they are finite beings, not Being itself. There is a qualitative distinction between Creator and creation, between time and eternity. 68 Augustine, Confessions 9.10.24. 69 Ibid., 7.17.23. 70 Ibid., 9.10.25.</page><page sequence="15">RICHARD B. MILLER 401 Here, as in the passage from Book 10 noted above, Augustine expresses an iconic epistemology. Sensible reality points beyond itself to its permanent structure and its source of origination. Equally important, it communicates content. Their vision is christological and sacramental, wherein they encounter the Logos through whom they believe creation is made and structured. Within such a framework, earthly goods have relative value and death itself is not to be feared. Soon we are told that Monica herself neither despaired over her imminent death nor worried about the whereabouts of her burial. Addressing God, Augustine writes of Monica: "[She] desired only to be remembered at your altar, where she had served you with never a day's absence. From that altar, as she knew, the holy Victim is made available to us, he through whom the record of debt that stood against us is annulled. . . . To the sacrament of that ransom-price your handmaid made fast her soul with the bonds of faith."71 After Monica's death, Augustine reports that he does not weep at her funeral, but he does weep later, and he brings the narrative portion of Confessions to an end by expressing anxiety about whether his grief is excessive or inappropriate. "I found comfort in weeping before you about her and for her, about myself and for myself," he writes.72 At that critical juncture he asks publicly to confess and begs his readers not to judge him harshly for his grief surrounding her passing . But whether excessive or not, Augustine's grief is clearly not the feeling of despair of the sort he experienced with the passing of his unnamed friend. His grief draws on an altogether different emotional repertoire, focusing on Monica's future life rather than on his own fated mortality.73 "Let no one wrench her away from your protection," Augustine implores in his prayers after her passing.74 Equally important, in describing her life, Augustine sees Monica not only as a devout and obedient Christian but also as a sinner like himself in need of mercy and forgiveness- in her ordinariness as well as in her saintliness. Once again we find him homologizing reality to himself, but this time the likeness is mediated by theological concepts of sin and reconciliation rather than the terms of this- worldly agreements such as he enjoyed with his unnamed friend. Like his boyhood friendship, Augustine's relationship with his mother was one of intense bonding, a cleaving of two into one. But his attachment to Monica is not cast in terms of having "one soul in two bodies." He rather describes the bonding as between two 71 Ibid., 9.13.34. 72 Ibid., 9.12.33. 73 O'Donnell notes this contrast as well. He writes: "The death of M. resembles and disresembles the death of A.'s friend in 4.4.7. His grief in both cases is great: accepting Christianity does not eradicate grief, but perhaps transforms it from hopeless to hopeful." Understanding how, for Augustine, grief can be hopeful is important to grasping how his response to Monica's death differs from his response to the death of his unnamed friend. See O'Donnell, "The Confessions of St. Augustine: Book 9," n.p. [cited October 2009].

"For there had been but one life," he writes of his relationship with Monica, "woven out of mine and hers."75 Augustine's grief and subsequent prayer are presented to the reader as public matters. His account presumes an iconic epistemology that allows for a gaze that moves beyond mere appearances- private appearances- to a more expansive and potentially inclusive vision. Moreover, such an epistemology has moral and interpersonal implications. Monica was not a victim to the theft wrought by death, someone kept from him and others as fate's private possession. Indeed, Augustine openly pleads with his readers to pray for her salvation. In his grief Augustine mourns not for himself, nor about himself, but on her behalf. That the epiphany in Ostia is prompted by a reflection about the communion of saints seems hardly accidental. He prays for God to forgive her and accept her into the eternal community. In other words, Augustine mourns for her hopefully and charitably, with an eye to her independent interests. His grief has been re-ordered, structured in ways that reflect a turn from vice to virtue- from cupiditas to caritas- enabling him to mourn and love his mother for her own sake. He is able to see Monica as other, independent of his own projections and points of self-reference. Augustine's response to his mother's death enables us to grasp how caritas, iconicity, and heterology are triangulated into an altogether new onlook in Confessions. As Kim Paffenroth observes, all Augustine's friendships in Book 9 of Confessions demonstrate that he "has learned to have earthly loves that lead to and include God, rather than distract from knowledge or love of him."76 Paffenroth's remark recalls a comment Augustine makes while reflecting on the death of his boyhood friend: "Blessed is he who loves you, and loves his friend in you"77- loving in a way that he admits he could not do as a youth. But exactly what it means to love a neighbor "in God" is seldom clear in Augustine's work. I propose that thinking in terms of an onlook that triangulates caritas, iconicity, and heterology provides an important clue. Together these ideas structure Augustine's graced dispositions of mind and will. Metaphysically, Augustine views sensible reality within a Platonized Christianity as pointing beyond itself and as structured by a timeless principle that has been rendered available to humanity through reason and revelation. Epistemologically, that fact provides a framework that enables him to grasp reality in its own right, independently of his anxious wishes or projections. Normatively, knowledge of these facts, empowered by grace, turns the mind and will away from themselves to others' needs and interests, however ordinary or extraordinary. Monica's death, the crescendo of the narrative portion of Confessions, thereby provides a clear contrast 75 Ibid., 9.1230. 76 Kim Paffenroth, "Book Nine: The Emotional Heart in the Confessions " in Reader's Companion, 147. 77 Augustine, Confessions 4.9.14.</page><page sequence="17">RICHARD B. MILLER 403 to the "unfriendly form of friendship" interpreted by way of evil's conundrum in Book 4. Ш Friendship: From Having to Being Augustine's ethics of heterology- love of the other for her own sake- is part of a broader project of seeing the world in a way that is freed from an anthropocentric imaginary. He stands with Iris Murdoch who writes, "it is a task to come to see the world as it is."78 But for Augustine, "to see the world as it is" requires an onlook that is both a gift and a task. It is a task insofar as it requires a reorientation of human tendencies and dispositions. It is a gift insofar as it arises from the mind and will transformed by grace. One outcome of Augustine's conversion from cupiditas to caritas is the ability to experience friendship in a radically altered way: the conversion from having a friend to being a friend. In Book 4, Augustine anguishes over the friend he lost, an experience conditioned by the idea of friendship as a possession. In that context, death is a thief, stealing what it can in a seemingly heedless and arbitrary way. In Book 9, Augustine's grief over his mother's passing is conditioned not by the thought of possession but by what it means to be a friend to her in her final days and in her death. He changes from experiencing friendship passively to experiencing it actively. Put another way, Augustine's friendship with Monica was a matter of being rather than having, to recall a distinction from Gabriel Marcel's phenomenology.79 For Marcel, being and having point to two different ways in which we relate to other things and persons. Having pertains to things or persons that are external to me- possessions that I can lose or dispose of or use instrumentally.80 Being corresponds to relationships that exist on different terms. In relationships of being, the encounter with another is not one of externality but of mutuality, a matter of participation. With being, as opposed to having, one makes another's ends one's own. Relationships of being are embodied, constitutive of who one is. They thus differ from relationships in which we proceed "on a level where ... the contrast between within and without retains a meaning."81 Strikingly, Augustine describes his relationship with Monica, as I noted earlier, in precisely such embodied terms: "For there had been but one life, woven out of mine and hers."82 The fact of embodiment suggests that Augustine's onlook undergoes a dramatic transformation from one in which God and world are seen in anthropomorphic 78 Murdoch, Sovereignty of Good, 91 [emphasis in original]. 79 Gabriel Marcel, Being and Having: An Existentialist Diary (Gloucester, Mass.: Peter Smith, 1976). I am grateful to Mark Wilson for several conversations along these lines. For a discussion of Augustine, Marcel, and embodiment, see Mark Wilson, "The Emotion of Regret in an Ethics of Response," Ph.D. diss., Indiana University, 2007. 80 Marcel, Being and Having, 169. 81 Ibid., 174. 82 Augustine, Confessions 9.12.30.</page><page sequence="18">404 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW and bodily terms to one in which to be embodied rather means to be related-in- difference. Augustine is thereby enabled to love temporal goods that exist across a range of differentiated possibilities.83 To love is to share something fundamental to one's being in a way that respects difference. Augustine can thus distinguish himself from his mother not by keeping part of his life secret or by running from her as he had rebelliously done in his youth. With his relationship refrained and thus reconstituted, he achieves distance from her in terms of ontology, not volition.84 He poeticizes Monica by situating her within a new set of relationships, describing her as a member of the "brethren" under God rather than as his mother and as a "fellow-citizen" in the "eternal Jerusalem."85 In that context, Augustine asks God not to allow death to steal Monica but to preserve her for those willing to pray for her and remember her.86 All of this reflects how his focus has shifted from what he putatively gained from friendship to what he can offer it. Augustine's reflections upon the death of Monica suggest that he understands friendship's flow of giving and receiving in a new way. However much Augustine's intersubjectivity emphasizes mutuality and reciprocity, it remains the case that he represents true friendship- embodied friendship- as more a matter of giving than yearning to receive. To be a friend on Augustine's description requires unconditional self-giving and availability. In this way, he reveals features of love that serve as the anti-type to evil's conundrum: Desire can be appropriately attached to the goods of another when it is freed to see those goods on their own life-giving terms. Moving across the sweep of Confessions , we should now see that Augustine leaves us with stark alternatives when it comes to friendship and the emotions. We are presented with the idea of self-centered and idolatrous love which is no true love at all, both too much and not enough. The alternative to that love is Christian love of the neighbor "in God," in which an encounter with the beloved triangulates caritas, iconicity, and heterology. The corrective to narcissism for Augustine resides in an onlook toward the world shaped by Platonized Christianity and empowered by graced excellences. That fact seems to provide little by way of hope or direction for non-Christians or non-Platonic Christians when it comes to an ethics of friendship and love. For non- Augustinián s , to see the world as it is may be more of a task than a gift of any sort. But Augustine may leave his readers with more general, workable ideas about friendship and love if we step back from the particulars of Confessions. His key insight is that the apparent love of another can be fraught with immediacy and, with that, a lack of differentiation and respect for the beloved as an individual with claims 83 Brown correctly understands the importance for Augustine of seeing the universe as consisting of differentiated goods, an insight made available to Augustine upon grasping neoplatonic metaphysics. Augustine of Hippo, 100. 84 1 owe this thought to Margaret Mohrmann. 85 Augustine, Confessions 9.13.37. 86 We do well to note that Confessions Book 9 is followed by Augustine's searching discussion of memory in Book 10.</page><page sequence="19">RICHARD B. MILLER 405 of her own. True friendship requires a framework for interpreting the meaning of one's love on terms that are meaningful to the lover as well as the beloved. What Augustine finds in Platonic Christianity is an instance of what, he suggests, we all need in order to have true love: a horizon within which we contextualize our loves and acquire the ability to value our friends on terms that they can esteem. That is to say, Augustine believes that in order to befriend another we must understand what friendship is as a prior condition. We cannot grasp friendship inductively or intuitively, building up a general account of friendship based on serial relationships that we acquire over time; we need a wider onlook according to which we are able to perceive what a particular friendship signifies.87 Such an onlook performs work that is not unlike that of a moral rule: As action-guiding, it helps the agent set the future.88 If one's onlook is to enable us to grasp the otherness of our friends, moreover, it cannot be conceived in our own image. That is to say, our experience of any particular friend requires the mediation of an interpretive framework according to which that relationship makes sense on terms other than those we concoct for our own advantage. ■ Grief and Virtue Augustine's two accounts of grief in Confessions should remind us of the great importance of grief as a concept in moral psychology among classical writers in the West. It should also instruct us (more importantly, at least from Augustine's point of view) that there are ways of mourning that can be either morally undesirable or commendable. Mourning need not devolve into melancholia of a Freudian sort. Rather, grief can be marked by either virtue or vice. This presupposes the idea that, for Augustine, emotions are not merely raw feelings, akin to itches or throbs. Emotions are instead moral responses, registering what we value through the passions. Our feelings thus presuppose objects that, when properly perceived, prevent us from being self-indulgent or from attaching ourselves inordinately to them. Augustine writes: "In general, as a man's will is attracted to or repelled in accordance with the varied character of different objects which are pursued or shunned, so it changes and turns into feelings of various kinds."89 Emotions express an interpretation of an event, the embrace or loss of an objective good. Ideally, dejection is the expression of a properly ordered appreciation, for we would not feel a loss were we not previously attached to something genuinely valuable that has now ceased to be. 87 Here Augustine seems close to John McDowell's notion of virtue as reason, understood as "an ability to recognize requirements which situations impose on one's behavior." See John McDowell, "Virtue and Reason," Monist 62 (1979) 331-50, at 333. 88 On rules in relation to time in general and the future in particular, see Richard B. Miller, "Rules," in The Oxford Handbook of Theological Ethics (ed. Gilbert Meilaender and William Werpehowski; New York: Oxford University Press, 2005) 220-36. 89 Augustine, City of God 14.6.</page><page sequence="20">406 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Viewing grief as potentially virtuous seems odd, of course, given our tendency to understand virtue in positive terms, as ennobling or self-enhancing. We typically associate the virtues with a good and genuinely happy life. But that fact should not prevent us from seeing how responses to loss and disconnection can also be expressions of moral excellence. Virtue, Aristotle would remind us, means feeling pleasure and pain in the right manner. Schooled in the virtues, we should feel "at the right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right people, with the right motive, and in the right way," as he says of strong and noble character.90 Casting similar ideas in Christian terms, Augustine writes: "Citizens of the Holy City of God, as they live by God's standards in the pilgrimage of this present life, feel fear and desire, pain and gladness in conformity with the holy Scriptures and sound doctrine; and because their love is right, all these feelings are right in them."91 All of this is to say that grief, like other emotions, is conditioned by the order of love that underlies it. Augustine's sadness as recalled in Books 4 and 9 tells him something about how he orders his loves. He understands desires and affections as depending on how an agent is ordered- either toward oneself or God. As Augustine writes in The City of God: And so a rightly directed will is love in a good sense and a perverted will is love in a bad sense. Therefore a love which strains after the possession of a loved object is desire; and the love which possesses and enjoys that object is joy. The love that shuns what opposes it is fear, which the love that feels that opposition when it happens is grief. 92 The desirability of our desires is a function of our deeper loves. Augustine thus concludes: "Consequently, these feelings are bad, if the love is bad, and good if the love is good."93 Moreover, and equally important, Augustine's account of virtue tells us something about the complexity of desire and freedom in the moral life. Here evil's conundrum in Confessions provides an instructive counter-point. Books 1-3 teach us that vice combines inordinate desire with arbitrary freedom- freedom that aspires to be God-like, uncreated and non-contingent. Vice is thus both excessive and empty, as I noted earlier. Virtue contrasts in a parallel, two-fold sense: Desirable desires are ordered by charity, which, in turn, enables the self to choose in ways that are free from an image of the self as uncreated. All of this is made possible by the infusion of charity spread across the heart- a Pauline notion that courses throughout much of Augustine's work. In The Spirit and the Letter, Augustine writes about the proper and improper motives of moral action with this compound idea regarding desire and freedom in mind: "And if the commandment be done through fear of penalty and not through love of righteousness, it is done in the temper of servitude not 90 Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 1106b20-24. 91 Augustine, City of God 14.9. 92 Ibid., 14.7. 93 Ibid.</page><page sequence="21">RICHARD B. MILLER 407 freedom- and therefore it is not done at all. For there is no good fruit which does not rise from the root of charity. The man in whom is the faith that works through love, begins to delight in the law of God after the inward man, and that delight is a gift not of the letter but of the spirit."94 For Augustine, proper action is carried out in a way that is free from the self's worries about its own welfare, free from fear of failing or falling short. As well, it is done with affections that are themselves shaped by charity, enabling one to delight in the Good for its own sake. With that more general account in mind, we can say that, for Augustine, charitable grief -dolor informed by caritas- is grief that is free from anxiety about the self's own mortality and contingency, grief that is capable of imagining in loving terms what is fitting to another who has died. Virtuous grief thus re-poeticizes death, viewing it not as a. finis but as having a telos, beyond the appearances of mutability and mortality. ■ Augustinián Realism Revisited If I am correct about how caritas, iconicity, and heterology triangulate in Augustine's ethics of love and friendship, then it is necessary to rethink what is commonly meant by the notion of "Augustinián realism." As influentially defined by Reinhold Niebuhr, realism in the Augustinián tradition typically positions itself between various forms of idealism, on the one hand, and cynicism, on the other. Realism for Niebuhr aspires toward aims that soberly reckon with facts about human will-to-power, sloth, and fallibility while refusing to accept such facts as the final word about what can and should be imaginatively explored in the exercise of human responsibility. As Niebuhr puts it in "Augustine's Political Realism," The terms "idealism" and "realism" are not analogous in political and metaphysical theory; and they are certainly not as precise in political as in metaphysical theory. In political and moral theory "realism" denotes the disposition to take all factors in a social and political situation, which of- fer resistance to established norms, into account, particularly the factors of self-interest and power. . . . "Idealism" is in the esteem of its proponents, characterized by loyalty to moral norms and ideals, rather than to self-interest, whether individual or collective. It is, in the opinion of its critics, character- ized by a disposition to ignore or be indifferent to the forces in human life which offer resistance to universally valid ideals and norms.95 "Realism" as it has come to be known in theological ethics requires normative reasoning to reckon with certain indisputable facts about social life that reveal the limits of our will and understanding along with our dependence on and vulnerability 94 Augustine, "The Spirit and the Letter," in Augustine: Later Works (ed. and trans. John Burnaby; Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1960) 215-16. 95 Reinhold Niebuhr, "Augustine's Political Realism," in Christian Realism and Political Problems (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1953) 119-20.</page><page sequence="22">408 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW to powers that lie beyond our control. Augustine's account of human nature, Niebuhr avowed, underwrites that line of thinking. The core feature of Augustinián realism understood in this way is its commit- ment to accounting, especially accounting with the conditions of finitude within which human action occurs. Describing Niebuhr's brand of realism, Robin Lovin writes: "Realism implies recognition of the limits of purely moral solutions to political problems and calls for attention to the realities that shape social, political, and economic conflicts."96 On that account, the realist must be responsive to certain incorrigible facts about history and human proclivities along the way toward developing social criticism. Such facts embarrass those who aspire, optimistically, to Utopian ideals of love, social harmony, and equality. Failures in social criticism to account for what Niebuhr understood as moral recalcitrance disqualify such criticism from passing as plausibly realistic. Realism on this description counsels against this- worldly moral perfectionism. Augustinián realism of the iconic variety I have described differs from the political realism made famous by Niebuhr. Iconic realism need not deny that human action occurs within conditions of finitude to which social critics and activists must account. It puts limits on the human desire to conceive of reality by way of a narcissistic and anthropocentric imaginary. But iconic realism identifies the practical limits of human thought and action not as a condition for being realistic but as a consequence. Iconic realism insists that knowledge of the conditions of finitude is mediated by onlooks that presuppose and express epistemic and volitional dispositions that situate human desire and action within a broader, theocentric framework. Augustinián moral and social criticism thus requires habits of interpretation as much as it does accounting.97 For Augustine, the task of interpretation was assisted by Platonic philosophy and its understanding of the relationship between sensible reality and its underlying, permanent structure. For the iconic realist, what presents itself as real must indeed include a proper reckoning with human limitations, but not only those that frustrate moral perfectionism. The real is first and foremost a matter of what becomes available, donatively, through proper disclosure. As I noted earlier, for the iconic realist, gaining knowledge of reality is a gift as well as a task. Regarding matters of this essay- friendship and intimate relationships- the real thus frees the iconic realist from forming relationships driven by anxious needs and imperious attachments. That is to say, iconic realism makes possible the disclosure of the other on terms 96 Robin W. Lovin, Reinhold Niebuhr and Christian Realism (Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 1995) 6 [emphasis mine]. Lovin develops a form of Christian realism indebted to Niebuhr and Bonhoeffer along political, moral, and theological lines in Christian Ethics and the New Realities (Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2008) 1-18. 97 Niebuhr gets at some of these ideas in his own way, drawing not from Platonic thought but from biblical and theological symbols in his essay, "As Deceivers, Yet True," in Beyond Tragedy: Essays in the Christian Interpretation of History (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1937) 3-24.</page><page sequence="23">RICHARD B.

Augustine's iconic realism thus enables a manner of being-in-the-world according to which we may love on terms that are attuned to the neighbor in her alterity. It enables us to be available to others, experienced as gifts that we are thereby open to receive. 98 Stanley Hauerwas expresses this idea in his discussion of "freedom as the presence of the other," in The Peaceable Kingdom: A Primer in Christian Ethics (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1983) 44-46. But rather than say, as Hauerwas does, that the other's "need is often the occasion of our freedom," Augustine's idea is that one cannot ascertain the alterity of the other without first being freed from self-preoccupation. On those terms he and Hauerwas would concur with the latter 's claim that "the 'otherness' of another's character not only invites me to an always imperfect imitation, but challenges me to recognize the way my vision is restricted by my own preoccupation."
