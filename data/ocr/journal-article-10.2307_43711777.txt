<plain_text><page sequence="1">VENGEANCE IN THE APOCALYPSE OF JOHN In his article on "Vengeance" in the Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, Walter Harrelson summarizes what the NT has to say on this subject in one brief paragraph.1 The brevity of the treatment could be justified with the observation that the word ekdikeõ occurs only six times, ekdikēsis nine times and ekdikos only twice. It could be argued that such infrequent usage indicates that the idea is relatively unimportant in the NT, as compared, say, with the OT. Such an observation might by itself have considerable significance. It would be of even greater significance if it could be demon- strated that Jesus in his life and teaching considers God himself as the sole agent of vengeance. In the portrait of Jesus provided by the Gospels this seems quite consistent. It would certainly be wrong to assume, however, that this is new in Christian sources. The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs already point in this direction when God is most frequently described as the agent who carries out ven- geance (TReuben 6,6; TLevi 18,1; TDan 5,10; TJoseph 20,1). Once the reader is explicitly told to leave vengeance in the hands of God ( kai dos tõ theõ tēn ekdikēsin TGad 6,7). Paul uses similar terminology me 'eautous ekdikountes, agapētoi, alla dote topon tē orge (Rom 12,19), although there is no agreement on the reasons why Paul urges his readers not to avenge themselves. There are those who see Paul here as indebted to the Sermon on the Mount, counseling non-retaliation because the incarnation has pro- vided a better way of overcoming evil. Love for the enemy, while not ad- vocated in those exact words, is expressed through feeding one's enemies, blessing the persecutors, etc.2 Others find Paul's approach reminiscent of the material in the Qumrân literature and assume that Paul takes a pessimis- tic view of what happens to people when positive influences are brought into their lives. According to this point of view, Paul counsels non-retaliation because God's own vengeance is so imminent that human vengeance can be dispensed with.3 1 "Vengeance," 4, 748. This lack of interest in the NT material also characterizes other articles in this dictionary, e.g., "Joy," "God," "Demon," "Slavery," and "Friend." Henry McKeating, "Vengeance is Mine, A Study of the Pursuit of Vengeance in the OT," ExpT 74 (1963) 239-245, in a helpful survey of the OT material concludes that the most firmly religious spirits of Israel are usually the most vindictive (242). 2 W.

Walter Bauer in noting the differences in spirit on the point of vengeance between Lk 6 and Lk 18,6-8 says that the latter passage reminds us strongly of Ap 6,9-11. Only what in Luke is a lost chord becomes in the book of Revelation the key note for the whole. The Apocalyptist breathes a glowing hatred against all enemies and persecutors of Christianity and assuages himself with thoughts about the terrible sufferings which await them.4 H. Preisker says that strong as the emphasis on brotherly love is in the Johannine literature the fervor which moves it to the level of loving one's enemy is now missing. Enemies are consigned to their fate, indeed the Revelation of John manifests a virtuosity of hatred (footnote refers to Ap 19,2 adding "and often" [ !] ) and satisfies itself with the punishment coming to the enemies completely in the manner of Jewish apocalyptics.5 W. D. Davies summarizes the ethical position of the Apocalypse toward the political authorities with the words, "an abortive hatred that can only lead, not to their redemption, but to their destruction/'6 Putting it less drastically Michael Waldmann calls the material in the Ap an exception to the rule prescribed in the rest of the NT7 and Richard Volkl also con- cludes that the martyr sentiment accounts for the fact that now hatred is not only considered possible but condoned and endorsed as Christian. Here there is a real danger that love for the self veils itself as love for God and desires vengeance upon one's enemies.8 Via a different route, C. G. Jung arrived at a similar conclusion. John, the loving presbyter, was not able to separate his conscious from his un- conscious. In the visions of the book of Revelation and especially in the more harsh aspects Jung sees "less a metaphysical mystery than the out- burst of long pent-up feelings such as can frequently be observed in people who strive for perfection."9 In his attempt to practice love John had to shut out all negative feelings, and, thanks to a helpful lack of self-reflec- tion, he was able to forget them. But though they disappeared from the conscious level they continued to rankle beneath the surface, and in the course of time spun 4 W.

From this there grew up a terrifying picture that blatantly contradicts all ideas of Christian humility, tolerance, and love of your neighbor and enemies, and makes nonsense of a loving father in heaven and rescuer of mankind. A veritable orgy of hatred, wrath, vindictive- ness, and blind destructive fury that revels in fantastic images of terror breaks out and with blood and fire overwhelms a world which Christ had just en- deavoured to restore to the original state of innocence and loving communion with God.10 The most widely used explanation of the teaching of the Ap on vengeance is to assert that the book has reverted to Judaism at this point and that the author has simply been following Jewish apocalyptic writers here.11 Before we accept that explanation it may be helpful to review the contexts of those passages which have caused the most discussion on this subject. The material in the Ap reflects the desire of the church that God will execute vengeance. This is certainly true of 6,9-11. At the breaking of the fifth seal the Seer perceives underneath the altar (thus in the very presence of God) the souls of those slaughtered for God's Word and for their testi- mony. They cried with a great cry ( ekrazan phone me galē) and the con- tent of their cry was: "How long, before you will vindicate ( krineis ) and avenge ( ekdikeis ) our blood from the ones dwelling upon the earth ?" Al- though it is clear that the concern of the martyrs here is one of vengeance it is equally clear that they are concerned most about the time when their vindication will take place. Vengeance must follow if God is 'o despotes 'o ' agios and alēthinos, because a great wrong has been done. It may be that the cry for vengeance is personal12 or corporate13 although we probably ought to take it in its most inclusive sense. The prayer of the souls under the altar is found also in other apocalyptic material. R. H. Charles lists as the forerunner of this passage 1 Enoch 47,2.4 which reads : In those days the holy ones who dwell above in the heavens, Shall unite with one voice, And supplicate and pray, On behalf of the blood of the righteous which has been shed, And that the prayer of the righteous may not be in vain before io Ibid. 11 The first major attempt in this direction is that of E. Vischer, Die Offenbarung des Johannes , eine jüdische Apokalypse in christlicher Bearbeitung (Leipzig, 1895). 12 "The note of personal vengeance cannot be totally eliminated from their prayer" (R. H. Charles, The Revelation of St. John, I, 175). 13 Matthias Rissi, Zeit und Geschichte in der Offenbarung (Zürich, 1952) 142: "Their request is not only for personal vengeance but for the revelation of the praise of God in the final judgment." E. Lohse {Die Offenbarung des Johannes, Göttingen, 1960) considers it more than a cry for vengeance. They are praying for the establish- ment of God's righteousness on earth (43).</page><page sequence="4">1966] Vengeance in the Apocalypse of John 303 the Lord of Spirits, That judgment may be done unto them, And that they may not have to suffer forever (v. 2). The other passage to which he refers (En 22,5) seems not to apply im- mediately to our verses. Very similar, however, is 4 Esd 4,35 where the souls of the righteous in the chambers also ask: "How long shall we tarry here? When does the reward appear on the threshing floor ?" The answer is, "Whenever the number of their group will be fulfilled." Here the major interest is in the time, not on the theme of vengeance, which is not even mentioned. In 1 En 99,3 ; 104,3 after the promise that the portals of heaven will be open to them he tells his readers : "And in your cry, cry for judgment, and it shall ap- pear to you ; for all your tribulation shall be visited on the rulers and on all who helped those who plundered you" (104,3). Their prayers are to be raised as a memorial, placed as a testimony before the angels, "that they may place the sin of the sinners for a memorial before the Most High" (99, 3). 14 Here the prayers of the righteous, although not specifically di- rected toward vengeance stand as evidence against the sinners. Before looking at the fulfillment of these prayers when the time had been completed it may be well to ask whether these prayers should cause some embarrassment. Does this longing for vengeance really violate in any fundamental way that which is at the heart of the Gospel? If the Ap was used in the early Christian worship this material in chapter six provides striking evidence for the freedom with which the Christian church expressed its concern for justice. It is tempting for those who have never had to wrestle with major injustices to criticize these intense longings for justice as sub-Christian or a reversion to Judaism. Wilhelm Bousset, however, com- ments : "One attempts in vain to weaken the strong attitude of vengeance found in this prayer. We must get accustomed to the fact that the Apoca- lyptist, as he views the martyr-band, lives in stronger attitudes of hatred and of hope than we can condone."15 The same phenomenon is found also in the Pss of the OT and here, too, opinions have differed sharply on their continuing usefulness for Christian worship. D. Bonhoeffer concluded that as sinners who inevitably associate evil ideas with prayers of vengeance we should not use them, but insofar as Christ is in us, who has taken all of God's vengeance upon himself, whom God's wrath struck in our place, and who, thus struck by the wrath of God and in no other way forgave his enemies, who experienced vengeance so 14 Charles, op. cit., 175. 15 Die Offenbarung Johannes (Göttingen, 61906) 271.</page><page sequence="5">304 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 28 that his enemies could be freed, we as members of this Jesus Christ, may indeed pray these psalms through Jesus Christ, out of the heart of Jesus Christ.16 Others argue that the conviction that Jesus was indeed struck by the wrath of God is in no way to be used to support the practice of praying psalms of vengeance in the name of Jesus. Rather, we should recognize how far Jesus was from every wish for vengeance and thus realize that thoughts of vengeance are in no way reconcilable with his spirit.17 We need, there- fore, to differentiate between the wrath of God and human desire for vengeance and see these materials rather as a genuine Christian response to a serious violation of justice. The prayer is answered in that the martyrs are given white robes in which they are to await the final acts of God's program in history. The fulfillment of this prayer for vengeance is described in the rest of the Ap. Throughout the various developments the purpose is always to bring men to repentance through the tragedies of history (Ap 9, 20.21). 18 As the judgments, however, intensify so do the emotions of those who are on the winning side. Even the angel of the waters when punishment strikes its domain responds: "Righteous art thou, thou who art, and wast, the Holy One, because thou hast judged these things, because the blood of the saints and of the prophets has been poured out, and thou hast given them blood to drink. They deserved it !" As he said this he heard the altar saying, "Yea Lord, God the Almighty, your judg- ments are true and just" (Ap 16,5-7). Here the prayer focuses not on selfish vindication but on the attributes of God which have become manifest through these deeds. Goďs integrity has been made manifest. In the same vein the great cry of rejoicing over the destruction of Babylon is to be seen not only over against the triple lament about her destruction (Ap 18,10.16.19) but also in the light of their joy that God has completed his process of judgment. The stress is not on the delight in her suffering but joy in the outcome of Goďs cause. To be sure, the historical fact that the blood of the prophets and the saints and of all those who had been slaughtered on the earth was found in her is not glossed over, but even this allusion to Jezebel's fate in the OT is merely stated as a part of the total picture of justice (Ap 18,24). Indeed, we may 16 D.

Vengeance is also present (Ap 19,2) and the throng in heaven is joyful that the smoke of the great whore rising up for ever and ever is all that remains to remind them of their conflict with her (v. 3). This is the closest we come in the Ap to the prospect of spending eternity enjoying the misfortunes of the enemies of the church, but it is surely not correct to say that "not a breath of sympathy is to be found here,"20 for the very reason it is written is to warn people to avoid this fate. Two distinctive aspects of vengeance deserve further discussion : First, we need to observe that the followers of the Lamb do not directly participate in the battle against the beast or the whore except that they are to remain faithful throughout life and in that way will conquer. This stands in contrast to the concept of the messianic war which is present in other apocalypses in which the high point of the struggle between good and evil is depicted as an eschatological messianic war.21 To be sure, the Lamb appearing as if slain is no weakling. Yet the strongest weapon he has appears to be his own authority which he has won through his suffering. He alone is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals, "because thou wast slain and by thy blood didst purchase for God men of every tribe and language, people and nation . . . and they shall reign upon the earth" (Ap 5,5.9-10). He is portrayed as conquering, but his battle is almost always portrayed as a defensive war, and it has been considered significant that God is never described as going out to war ( polemeõ ) and that the verb polemeõ is used only twice of Christ (Ap 19,11; 2,16). 22 In the latter reference he will 19 See Hedwig Jahnow, Das hebräische Leichenlied im Rahmen der Völkerdichtung (Giessen, 1923) 219-221, especially 221 : "Der Schleier der Leichenklage, hinter dem für den christlichen Verfasser die Stimmung der Genugtuung und des Jubels liegt, wird also in diesem Stück doch etwas mehr gelüftet als in den verwandten Liedern des Ezechiel aus Tyrus." 20 L.

In 19,11 it may be that an act of judgment against the Christians is meant or possibly the words 'uper autõn should follow polemei. The verb polemeõ is used to describe demonic activity in Ap 12,7b ; 17,14. In addition, the noun polemos with an appropriate verb (prepare, make) occurs three times to describe Satanic activity (11,7; 12,17; 13,7); four times as neutral (12,7; 16,14; 19,19; 20,8). The verb nikaõ is used of the Lamb only twice (5,5 aorist; 17,14 future), while twice it describes the activity of the beast (11,7; 13,7), but it appears most often in connection with faithful followers of the Lamb (2,7.11.17.26; 3,5.12.21; 15,2; 21,7). Its usage in 6,2 is indefinite while in 12,11 the defeat of Satan is joined to his being cast out of heaven. The brethren have themselves defeated him "through the blood of the Lamb and through the word of their testimony/' autoi enikēsan auton dia to ' aima tou arniou kai dia ton logon tēs marturias autõn (12,11). Thus victory comes not by engaging in armed battle but by refusing to love one's life so much that one resists martyrdom and through consistent patterning of one's life upon the Lamb's sacrifice. Never are the followers of the Lamb clearly depicted as engaging in battle under his leadership. The closest that we come to this point of view is in 17,14 where we read that the ten kings moved out against the Lamb to war against the Lamb ( polemeõ ) but the Lamb triumphed over them {nikaõ) because he is the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, after which follows the phrase kai eoi meť autou klētoi kai eklektoi kai pistoi (v. 14). Is this indeed a case of the armies of the Lamb coming to "crush hostile nations" ? Is John adopting the imagery of a martyr host of warriors which will participate in the destruction of the wicked found in such places as 1 En 38,5; 40,19; 41,12? This position is taken by Charles, who, however, feels that "the martyrs are here not engaged on a mission of revenge, but in fulfillment of the righteous retribution. In xv :4 the vision . . . shows that the thought of revenge has wholly passed from the minds of the glorified martyrs."23 The RSV has avoided the problem by supplying the verb "is," thus, "and those with him are called and chosen and elect," while the NEB has : "his victory will be shared by his followers, called and chosen and faithful." If a verb is to be supplied Leivestad feels that we should supply nikēsousin. We would then read: "They will wage war on the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of Lords and King of Kings - the Lamb and the elect, the chosen, the faithful who are with him."24 The 23 Charles, op . cit., II, 74f. 24 Leivestad, op. cit., 231.</page><page sequence="8">1966] Vengeance in the Apocalypse of John 307 question is whether the followers of the Lamb fight with him. All that the text says is that the followers of the Lamb participate in his victory ( nikos ) not in his battle ( polemos ). Charles supports his interpretation by referring to another passage which occurs three times in the Ap, the quote from the Pss referring to ruling with a rod of iron (2,26-27; 12,5; 19,15). Charles asserts that this expression implies the actual destruction of the heathen nations and that apparently in their destruction the triumphant martyrs are to be active agents as members of the heavenly hosts which should follow the word of God. What seems almost incredible, however, is the way in which Charles skips from that interpretation, which has some justification, to say: At this moment that I am writing we can witness at least a partial fulfillment of this dread forecast, in which England and her allies are engaged in mortal strife with the powers of godless force and materialism . . . the present heathen system of international relations will sooner or later be destroyed and replaced by international relations of a Christian character.25 Charles has obviously missed the symbolism of this expression. The imagery of smashing a potter's vessel is found in the coronation ritual in Egypt where the King proclaims his universal power by symbolically smashing potter's vessels on which the names of foreign kings are in- scribed. In Mesopotamian texts, also, the idea that a regent will smash na- tions like a potter's vessel occurs frequently. It is said of Sargon that he destroyed all the lands as vessels of clay. Thus, the imagery points in the direction of "universal, judicial authority."26 In fairness to the Ap we must clearly distinguish the ways in which it sees war in heaven and even the final conflagration but never allows us to believe that the Christians follow the Lamb, as their general, in a messianic blood-bath nor that "Christian" nations will eventually triumph through the instrument of war. The clue to history lies with the Lamb that was slain, not with the nation which possesses the most impressive arsenal. While certain faint traces of messianic war remain, such a great trans- mutation has taken place that it hardly seems accurate to designate it as such. In his book on messianic war Hans Windisch argued that although Jesus rejected the idea of a messianic war it reappears in Christianity with Paul and the Ap. The angels are seen in the gospels as officials charged with the judicial processes but not as soldiers of war (Mk 13,41). In the Ap it is different. Here, according to Windisch, while there is no thought of Christians themselves resorting to armed force (Ap 13,10) because this 25 Charles, op. cit., I, 75. 26 H. J. Kraus, Psalmen , I (Neukirchen, 1961), 20.</page><page sequence="9">308 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 28 is a mark of the Satanic forces, heavenly warriors emerge as those who alone can fight for the cause of God. Thus, when we come to Ap 19,11-21 which Windisch along with Bousset describes as the slaughter of the unrighteous by the Messiah ( Messiasschlacht ) he finds evidence that "the exalted mantle of the terribly violent king of the Jewish apocalyptic has been laid over the simple messianic prophet, Jesus of Nazareth, by Christian theology." Yet he has failed to observe that there is considerable distance between God/Christ and the battle. Neither really ever seems to get down into the thick of it. The heavenly hosts seem to take the brunt of the battle.27 To be sure, the element of struggle between good and evil remains, and victory is achieved, but it is not a victory fought with literal weapons. The sword which the Lamb uses, which protrudes from his mouth, is the Word of God. The subject of the messianic war can also be considered in the light of the War Scroll at Qumrân. Does this scroll assume that the members of the sect will engage in a literal war? Answers will vary to this question but there can be no disagreement on the place that the theme of vengeance plays in this scroll. According to Yigael Yadin one of the four questions which form the center of this fascinating document is: When is the appointed time of retribution and against whom will the war be waged? The motif of vengeance is particularly strong in this document, appearing especially frequently on the trumpets : "Upon the trumpets for their expeditions they shall write, Goďs mighty deeds to scatter the enemy and to put to flight all opponents of justice, and disgraceful retribution to the opponents of God" (col. Ill, 5). "Upon the trumpets of the battle arrays they shall write, Arrays of God's battalions for his wrathful vengeance upon all Sons of Darkness" (col. Ill, 6). "Upon the trumpets for calling the skirmishers when the battle intervals open . . . they shall write : 'Vengeful remembrance at the appointed time of God' " (col. Ill, 7-8). And when they close in for battle they shall write upon their banners "Battle of God, Vengeance of God . . . Retribution of God . . . and Retaliation of God" (col. IV, llff.). The day of battle is described as "day of vengeance" (col. VII, 5). 28 What- ever we may make of this document it is obvious that the theme of ven- geance is not as prominent in the Ap as in the War Scroll. It may indeed be considered significant that the NT canon does not contain a War Scroll nor indeed does the expression "day of vengeance" play any part in the 27 Windisch, op . cit., 75ff. 28 Yigael Yadin, The Scroll of the War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness (Oxford, 1962) 6, 105ff., 268f.</page><page sequence="10">1966] Vengeance in the Apocalypse of John 309 NT. There is every reason to believe that Jesus himself was convinced that vengeance was not part of his mission.29 A second significant aspect of vengeance is the fact that the saints are at no place depicted as enjoying forever the torture of their enemies. When we compare this with other apocalyptic material the contrast is remarkable. Not only do the righteous have a hand in the destruction of their enemies, but vengeance has been placed into their hands. According to En 90,19 the sheep slay all the wild animals with the sword given to them. The Apoca- lypse of Abraham looks forward to the time when sacrifices will be restored and "they shall destroy those who have destroyed them, and shall insult those who have insulted them, and of those who have defamed them they shall spit in the face, scorned by Me, while they (the righteous) shall be- hold Me full of joy" (29). The book of Jubilees anticipates the time when the Lord will heal his servants, and they will arise and will see great peace and will cast out their enemies ; and the just shall see it and be thankful and rejoice in joy to all eternity, and shall see judgment and curses upon all their enemies (23, 29). Such vengeance is clearly in the hands of the Israelites : In the Midrash rabba on Ru 2,19 a saying ascribed to R. Eliezer b. Jacob reads: "Ven- geance on the nations of the world is in the hands of the Israelites and the vengeance on the Israelites is in the hands of its poor (Ez 25,14)." And in Ethiopie Enoch the wicked are threatened with being delivered into the hands of the righteous, "who shall cut off your necks, slay you, and show you no compassion" (96,21). The righteous will "crush the wicked in Gehenna" (b. erubin 101a). Such literary parallels should not, however, lead us to conclude that Judaism is by definition more vengeful. Christianity, too, takes the wrath of God seriously and whenever we refrain from sentimentalizing the wrath of God we will feel at home with the mood of the Ap. As W. Bousset has noted, We will simply need to get used to the idea that a Christian has written the bloody and terrible picture presented here. Certainly the Apocalypse was read 29 With the exception of Lk 21,22 the expression day of vengeance does not occur in the NT. While it may be true that "without vengeance there can be no eschatological salvation," R. H. Swartzbach ("A Biblical Study of the Word 'Vengeance/" Interpr 6, [1952] 451-457) fails to draw out the implications of the omission of the words from Lk 4,19 where they would have formed a fitting conclusion to the OT quotation and also served to describe Jesus' mission. Whether they are missing because they did not square with Jesus' sense of mission or Luke's view of the Messiah cannot be deter- mined. The contrast with certain strata of the OT and such groups as the Samaritans (see John MacDonald, The Theology of the Samaritans [London, 1964] 380-392) should not be overlooked.</page><page sequence="11">310 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 28 among early Christians with great predilection, they sought to edify themselves with these scenes of vengeance.30 Not only do we need to get used to the idea that the Ap was written by a Christian but we must also get accustomed to seeing the concept of the wrath of God as central to the Christian faith. A. T. Hanson rejects the idea that the wrath of God as found in the Ap is a "sort of throw-back to the OT" and insists rather that we have here a "more carefully thought out conception of the Divine wrath even than Paul, one which is more closely related to the central message of Christianity, and which forms a comple- tion and crown of all that is said about the wrath in the rest of the Bible."31 He concludes, that, according to the Ap, wrath is worked out through the processes of history. The differences between the Ap and the OT are clear : "In the OT God judges by inflicting suffering; in the Apocalypse he judges by accepting suffering."32 In the Ap the dispensation of Satan is seen as inflicting suffering, the method of God fundamentally opposed to this is that he operates by accepting suffering.33 "Once accept the full implications of John's symbolism, and he proves far more of a Christian than most of his editors permit him to be."34 The wrath of God is part of his vengeance. That wrath is expressed through the course of history when human violence rules unchecked by the Lordship of the Lamb. Yet the ultimate destiny of the world will be determined not by the violence of men but by the Lamb who while refusing to choose between pacifism or militarism overcame violence by his own sacrifice. There is no reason why Christians should not fervently pray for the day when He who is just will reign supreme. When that day ap- pears justice will be achieved and the day of retribution will dawn for some. For others it will be a day of vindication. The translators of the NEB try to express this when they render orge variously with "retribution" and "vindication." By contrast the word "retribution" never occurs in the KJV and only twice in the RSV (Rom 11,9, Heb 2,2). Yet even the NEB translators when they come to the book of Revelation change an earlier reluctance to use "vengeance" (e.g., in Rom) for a predilection to use it ( orge is translated "vengeance" in Ap 6,16.17 ; 14,10; to potērion tou oinou tou thumou tēs orgěs autou 16,19 reads "fierce wine of his wrath," while a similar phrase is translated "of the wrath and retribution of God" in 19,15). 30 Bousset, op. cit., 435. 31 The Wrath of the Lamb (London, 1957) 159. »2 Op. cit., 168ff. ss Op. cit., 1 73. 34 Op. cit., 177.</page><page sequence="12">1966] Vengeance in the Apocalypse of John 311 Is there any reason why the less "psychological" or "anthropomorphic" terms cannot also be used in the Ap ? It is doubtful that the Ap views the wrath of God any differently than do the other writers of the NT.85 With regard to the ethical question there is clearly no shift. In neither Paul nor the Ap are the Christians viewed as either traditional pacifists or as agents of God's wrath in the Zealot way. Certainly, no call to arm for the great slaughter of Armageddon can appeal to the Ap, for there is no evidence that Christians will hasten the end by fighting for or with the Lamb. The emphasis, moreover, on the time beyond history is not upon viewing with delight the sufferings of the unrighteous but on the unhindered fellowship between those who follow the Lamb and Him who made their obedience possible. The literary motif that provides unity for the Ap is a sevenfold "blessing" (1,3; 14,13; 16,15; 19,9; 20,6; 22,7 ; 22,14), not a series of curses.
