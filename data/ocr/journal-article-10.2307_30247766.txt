Pascola costumes are described in their regional variations, with special emphasis on the masks. These latter fall into three separate but related styles: Yaqui, reaching from central Arizona south to the Rio Yaqui in Sonora; Rio Mayo, including southern Sonora and a few villages in northern Sinaloa; and Sinaloa, encompassing the upriver villages on the Rio Fuerte and stretching south to the Rio Ocoroni. Changes in mask style over time are described for each area. Mention is made of the curio trade and its influence on mask making. INTRODUCTION The Yaqui and Mayo Indians are Cahitan-speaking peoples whose aboriginal homeland lies on the coastal plains of southern Sonora and northern Sinaloa, Mexico. The Yaquis occupy the area adjacent to the Rio Yaqui, while Mayo country extends from the Rio Mayo in Sonora south to the Rio Ocoroni in Sinaloa. In addition, Yaqui colonies have appeared during the last century in Hermosillo, Sonora and in several locations near Tucson and Chandler in Arizona. Yaquis and Mayos voluntarily retain their cultural identity in several ways, the two most important of which are the use of their native language (Moises et al. 1971:1ii) and participation in a traditional folk-Catholic ceremonial system (Crumrine 1964). This latter has been described in many of its aspects (Spicer 1940:91-267 and Beals 1945:90-207), the two best known of which are the Lenten drama and the cycle of fiestas which continues throughout the year. These latter involve praying, singing, feasting, processions, and the presence of certain ceremonial performers. These performers form a loose grouping that has been called the "fiesta dancers and musicians" (Beals 1945:119). Within this grouping are two kinds of dancers, each with his musicians. One such group, the deer dancer and his accompanying singers, is well-known in the non-Cihitan world. A deer dancer appears on the seal of the state of Sonora, and the performance of a modified Yaqui deer dance has for many years been a high point of the famous Ballet Folkl6rico de Mixico. The other fiesta performer is less known, although his appearance at all fiestas is essential, while the deer dancer appears at only the larger ones. This performer is the pascola, whose name is an hispanicised version of the Cihitan pahko oola, or "old man of the fiesta" (Spicer 1940:174). Every fiesta, large 185</page><page sequence="2">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 Figure 1.

He is responsible for starting and closing the fiesta, at which he serves as ritual host. As a part of his duties he makes jokes, distributes cigarettes and water, and dances. He appears to serve as a focal point for the attention of fiesta-goers. One Mayo told the author that fiestas need people. It seems to be the pascola 's function to ensure that the people have something to do at a fiesta, and to keep them focused on the fact that there is a fiesta in progress. Certainly, when the pascola is performing publicly, most of the spectators watch him rather than the praying, singing, and vigil-keeping that are often going on at the same time. When the pascola goes off to eat or rest, the people tend to drift away, returning when he does. The pascola performs two sorts of dances. When the music is being provided by a harpist and a fiddler (or two fiddlers among the Mayos) the pascola dances in a slouched position, with his head slightly down and his arms dangling loosely at his sides. The steps he performs serve to reflect and vary the rhythm of the music, and are apparently European in origin. When the music is provided by a single man playing both flute and drum, the pascola dons a small wooden face mask and takes a sistrum rattle in his right 186</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA Figure 2. Southern Cihitan pascola dancing to the music of a flute and drum player at New Year's (January 1, 1970) Day fiesta at La Playa, Sinaloa. This was a large fiesta, and two separate sets of pascola musicians had been hired. One of these groups can be seen resting against the back wall of the ramada, behind the dancer. The setting is a ramada built directly in front of a southward-facing chapel. The wall in the background is on the west side of the ramada, and serves as protection from the afternoon sun. Note the similarity between the pascola's mask and that shown in Figure 10 which was collected in the same area. Photo by author. hand, playing it against his left palm. His stance becomes more of a crouch, and his footwork consists of pawing gestures. He turns his masked face from side to side in a peering motion. The rhythm of the music is carried and accentuated this time by complex rattle-play rather than by footwork. COSTUME The costume worn by the pascola remains essentially the same through- out the Caihitan range. Variations which do occur may be viewed in part as reflections of an increasing acculturation and secularization of the pascola complex from the Yaqui area south into Sinaloa. Set off against this is the apparent unavailability in the north of such naturally occuring objects as cocoons for leg rattles. 187</page><page sequence="4">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 Figure 3. Pascola dancing at Los Patos, Sinaloa, on Easter Sunday morning, March 29, 1970. This man's costume is typical of those worn at some smaller fiestas in the south, in that it consists of leg rattles worn over ordinary clothes. There were two pascolas at this fiesta, and aside from the cocoon rattles that each wore, the only item of personal pascola equipment was a mask which one of them brought. This was never worn, as there was no flute and drum player. The pascola is dancing in one end of a long ramada which also includes an altar, and, in the rear, quarters in which the fiesta participants eat and sleep for the duration of the fiesta. He is dancing to the music of two violins and one harp. The archaic method of holding the violins is typical for Yaqui and Mayo fiddlers. The fiesta has been going on since the previous noon, a fact attested to by the mound of ashes and coals placed before the musicians' feet to keep them warm through the night. Photo by author. 188</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA The Yaqui pascola wears a flannel blanket wrapped around his waist and upper legs, and tied at the knee with black woolen sashes, probably from the Rio Mayo area. The blanket often has a pink and white plaid pattern. He wears neither shirt nor shoes. Around his neck he wears a necklace of black and white beads with a pendant cross, often of haliotis shell. Above each ankle is wrapped a short string of cocoons filled with small pebbles, which serve as rattles. He also wears a leather belt from which are suspended several crotals. These were formerly of brass, but tin ones are increasingly being used, especially in the United States. His hair is done up into a small central topknot, into which is tied a large red or yellow plastic or paper flower. This costume is varied slightly on the Rio Mayo. Here the leg and waist wrappings are of white sheeting. They are secured with locally made woolen sashes. Although these are usually black, in a variety of twilled patterns, some have been seen in brown and white herringbone twill, and also several which are black with brightly colored lateral stripes or representational designs. The Mayo pascola also wears a shirt, frequently a white sweatshirt, and does not wear a necklace with pendant cross, although this omission is said to be recent. His leg rattles are much longer than those worn by Yaquis, often covering the leg from ankle to knee. His other equipment is much the same, although his sistrum rattle is often larger than that usually carried by Yaquis. There is little difference in costume between the Rio Mayo area and northern Sinaloa, except that a complete costume is less frequently found in the south. Often the pascola is distinguished only by his cocoon rattles, topknot, and bare feet. He can wear a work shirt and trousers, and several pascolas often share one belt, rattle, or mask between them. This is more often the case at small fiestas in the more isolated villages. MASKS While pascola costume seems to have a Yaqui and a Mayo variant, masks appear to be of three types: Yaqui, Rio Mayo, and Sinaloa. However, they all bear a generic resemblance to each other, and so a description of a generalized Cdihitan pascola mask is useful at this point. It is a small (averaging 19 cm. by 13 cm.) wooden face mask, which with few exceptions depicts either a human male or a goat-like animal. The base color is usually black or brown. It has a beard and eyebrows of horse or goat hair, or of ixtle (maguey) fibre. The beard is commonly at least as long as the wooden body of the mask, while the brows may be either long or roached. Such natural features as eyes, nose and mouth are naturalistically depicted. The mouth is often open, showing teeth and tongue. In addition, the mask is further embellished with incised or painted elements and motifs. These may be naturalistic or geometric. The most common is the cross, usually of the type called a "cross patde" (Laliberte and West 1960:62). This is almost always found in the middle of the forehead, and frequently appears 189</page><page sequence="6">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 on the chin, as well. In addition, there may be triangles or wedges on the cheeks, and flowers, plants, birds, lizards, stars, and other life and geometric forms on the forehead and sides of the mask. Finally, there is a border around all or part of the edge of the mask. This is usually built up of lines, dots, or triangles, arranged in patterns of varying complexity. The mask type described above appears to be unique to the Cihitan area. To be sure, there are bearded "old man" masks throughout Mexico and the Southwestern United States, but none of them have the precise combination of characteristics described above. An interesting northern parallel is found in the mask of Chakwzina kachina at Hopi (Colton 1949:57). This mask is also black in color and anthropomorphic, with an applied hair beard and geometric elements painted on the cheeks in bright colors. However, it is made of leather rather than wood, and lacks the border, central cross, and side decorations of the pascola mask. The similarity, while admittedly superficial, is made slightly more suggestive by the existence of a leather Yaqui mask in the Museo Nacional de Antropologia in Mexico City (Catalogue Number 29259(63)30.3 lf7c-109). This mask was collected before 1936, in the Rio Yaqui area. Although it is described in the catalogue as being worn by a "diablo" in the Moors and Christians dance, there is in the literature no mention of such a personage in that dance, and the mask resembles the orthodox pascola mask in its color, its male human features, and its applied hair beard. However, it has neither eyebrows nor painted decoration of any kind. Whether it is a survival of an older style of pascola mask or a more recent innovation in response to such stimuli as temporary lack of wood or the need for a light, readily portable mask in the Yaqui time of troubles is at present purely a matter for speculation. The favored wood for Cihitan pascola masks is torote prieto (Bursera inopinnata Bullock), although cottonwood and other soft woods are also used. Anyone may make a pascola mask, although mask makers are usually either pascolas or people otherwise involved in the fiesta arts. There appear to be no ceremonies connected with the making of masks. Pascola masks are not usually considered sacred things, although a mask that has been danced with by a pascola may be considered not a saleable item. Some older Mayo pascolas have expressed a desire to be buried with their masks or other items of equipment "so God will know that they are pascolas". This is strongly paralleled by Yaqui beliefs and customs concerning members of other ceremonial groups (Spicer 1941:140). There are three general style areas for Cihitan pascola masks. These are: the Yaqui area, including the Arizona and Sonora colonies and the Rio Yaqui villages; the Rio Mayo area, stretching south from the Rio Mayo to include the downriver villages on the Rio Fuerte, and the Sinaloa style. Within each area, both human and goat faces are made. These areas will be dealt with in the order given above. 190</page><page sequence="7">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA YAQUI MASKS The following description is based upon an examination of 54 masks, 28 of which the author was able to measure. The average length was 19.2 cm., while the width averaged 12.7 cm. Of the 54 masks, six had goat faces and one had a monkey face. The rest were anthropoid. The base color was black except in one case where it was orange and red. The monkey-faced mask had a pink muzzle and a white band around the eyes. The faces of the human masks are not set off with lines, carving, hair, or color from the sides of the masks. This, as will be seen, is in marked contrast with Rio Mayo practice. The face tends to be fully carved in high relief, rather than flattened, as is the tendency in the Rio Mayo area. In recent years, this trend appears to have become more pronounced, and the faces of some anthropomorphic masks have taken on a snout-like character. The eyes, nose, and mouth are carved and painted in a naturalistic fashion. The mouth is frequently open, with the tongue and teeth prominantly displayed. The eyes are often surrounded by painted red or white rings. In addition, there is frequently a vertical line or row of dots down the bridge of the nose, and a vertical isosceles triangle, point down, below each eye. These are usually painted white. The central forehead cross appears on all masks made for use by a pascola. Further embellishment often appears on the temples and sides of the mask, flanking the central cross. There is a tendency, especially on older masks, for this to include diagonal bands of interlocking scrolls. Flowers may also appear in these areas, as do such distinctively Yaqui design elements as "S"-shaped scrolls and small lizard forms. The border may consist of lines, dots, or rows of triangles. Yaqui goat-faced masks may have the facial features sculpted in some detail. The snout is undercut, and projects downwards at an almost vertical angle. Painted decoration includes the vertical triangles under the eyes, and usually some sort of striping down the nose. Aside from the central cross, there is seldom much decoration on the forehead and sides of the mask. Monkey-faced masks have apparently been made for at least the last twelve years, and are carved so as to present a markedly prognathous appearance. The snout is often colored red or pink, and the area around the eyes is left white. The majority, if not all, of these masks seem to come from Potam, Sonora, and may be the work of a single carver. Yaqui masks have beards and eyebrows of ixtle fiber or horsehair. The beards average 23.6 cm., or 1.22 times the length of the wooden portion of the mask. The brows are roached, and are seldom longer than 3 cm. Beside each eye and separated from the brows there is usually a single tuft of hair, of about the same length as the beard. Yaqui pascola masks have changed during the course of the last century. This change has been mostly in the direction of simplification of both the 191</page><page sequence="8">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 4. Yaqui pascola mask made prior to 1956, probably in Sonora. The verticality imparted by the under-eye triangles and the nose is typical of Yaqui masks, as are the "S"-shaped alignments on the sides. The placement and trimming of the hair are also consistent with Yaqui usage. The Latin cross on the forehead is uncommon, but within the range of accepted variation. The colors are black, white, and red. All of the masks illustrated are in the author's collection. Figure 5. Yaqui goat-faced pascola mask, probably made in Sonora. It was used at the Easter fiesta in Barrio Libre, Arizona. The colors are black, white, pink, orange, and light blue. Figure 6. Yaqui monkey-faced pascola mask made prior to 1970, probably in Sonora. This is typical of the monkey masks that have apparently recently become popular. Note the cross on the chin. The colors are black, white, and pink. sculptural and the painted aspects of the mask. Older Yaqui masks often have the chin outlined in white on the bottom and sides. In such cases, there will also be a small cross on the chin. This is apparently seldom done any more. Some older masks also have mouths that are shaped like an attenuated horizontal figure-eight. This feature is not found on any recent masks. Finally, the tendency towards running or contiguous designs on the sides seems to be characteristic of masks made before the 1930's. Over the years, Yaquis have discovered that Anglos will buy pascola masks. Since about 1930, masks have been produced specifically for sale to Anglos. These masks, made for the most part in Arizona, may have only one coat of paint, little or no incised detail, and very rough finishing on the back. They frequently lack the forehead cross. Finally, due to the high degree of communication between Arizona and Sonora Yaquis, many Sonoran pascolas will make masks and bring them up to the United States in the hope of selling them. These masks are apparently offered first to Arizona Yaquis, and then to dealers or anyone else who will buy them. They are in no way different from other Yaqui pascola masks. 192</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA RIO MAYO MASKS This discussion is based upon an examination of 60 Rio Mayo pascola masks, 34 of which were measured. This material is treated in more detail elsewhere (Griffith: in preparation). Rio Mayo masks are readily distin- guishable from their Yaqui counterparts in several ways. They average 19.9 cm. by 133 cm., or slightly larger than the average Yaqui mask. While the emphasis of the Yaqui mask is vertical, the Rio Mayo masks have a marked horizontality. This shows itself in various ways. For one thing, the face is usually set off from the sides of the mask by color contrast, by the use of framing lines, or by being carved flat in profile. In addition, the face tends to be relatively broader than that of the average Yaqui mask. The mouth is often depicted as a horizontal oval. The vertical isosceles triangles found on the cheeks of Yaqui masks are replaced by horizontally oriented triangles and wedges, pointing inwards towards the nose. All this tends to emphasize horizontality. The forehead cross is still present. It is frequently flanked by floral elements or other naturalistic designs, which may continue down the sides of the mask. The Yaqui tendency towards continuous scrolls is lacking here, as are the "S"-shaped elements and small lizards. On the other hand, snakes, anchors, and anthropomorphic figures appear rarely on Mayo masks but never on Yaqui ones. The base color of the mask is still black. When the face is painted in a color contrasting that of the sides, that color is most commonly red or white. Rio Mayo masks are susceptible to more variation in base color than are Yaqui ones. Blue, white, green, and tan masks have been observed in the former area. Another distinguishing feature of Rio Mayo masks is a greater willingness to use applied decoration such as haliotis shell, glass mirrors, and glass jewels. Furthermore, only one Rio Mayo mask has been seen with a goat face. It is similar to the Yaqui ones. The hair placement is also at variance with that on Yaqui masks. Mayo pascola masks are provided with goat hair, which is shorter, whiter, and silkier than the horsehair used in the Yaqui area. The brows are left almost as long as the beard, and both average 17.0 cm. Although there are no cheek tufts of the sort that appear on Yaqui masks, the hair sometimes extends around the entire face. It should be mentioned that the work of one man, Alcario Caamea, is so atypical as to fall outside the generalizations given above. His masks are painted in a variety of colors in tapered diagonal bands, and cannot be said to have a base color at all. He makes no distinction between the face and the side of the mask, as do most Mayo mask makers. In fact, his masks are apparently considered by most Mayos to be outside the range of acceptable variation for pascola masks. None the less, they are artistically very effective, and some have found their way into private collections, both here and in 193</page><page sequence="10">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 7. Rio Mayo pascola mask, made in 1962 by Plaicido Alamea of Jitombrumwi, Sonora. The flat face surrounded by hair is typical of traditional Rio Mayo masks, as are the horizontal wedges on the cheeks and the use of mirrors. The forehead cross has been covered by a small brass rosette. The colors are black, white, and red. Figure 8. Rio Mayo goat-faced pascola mask made about 1961 by Felipe Buitimea of El Rodeo, Sonora. This is one of the only two goat masks seen from this area. The colors are black, red, and white. Mexico. Further discussion of this man's vWork may be found in Griffith (in preparation). Older Mayo pascola masks differ in several ways from contemporary ones. They are larger, and relatively wider. Embellishment on the older masks is more elaborate, and representational designs are more common. Given the fact that most of the representational designs have an iconographic significance, this can be taken as evidence for the increasing secularization of the masks. This is certainly the case with those masks that are made for sale to non-Mayos. These are not as common as are comparable Yaqui masks, probably because the Yaqui trade is stimulated by the traffic of ceremonial performers between Sonora and the main market in Arizona. The few Mayo masks made for export are careless in their painting and finish, and frequently lack the decorations that appear on the cheeks, sides, and border of those masks that are made for use by a pascola. In fact, most of them lack the forehead cross, a feature that is considered essential to any mask that is used at a fiesta. The Rio Mayo mask style is found on the Rio Fuerte in northern Sinaloa, in the downriver villages of La Florida and San Miguel. This is quite possibly due to the recent contact between La Florida and the Rio Mayo due to the 194</page><page sequence="11">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA widespread "Fiestas for God" described by Erasmus (1961:285-91). Although some of the masks observed in these villages may have been imported from Sonora, others appear to have been made locally after the Sonoran style. There does, however, appear to be a substratum of older masks that resemble the upriver Sinaloa masks more than they do those from Sonora. SINALOA MASKS The typical Sinaloa pascola mask is either painted black or stained brown. Goat faces appear to be at least as popular as human ones. The Sinaloa goat faced mask is much more simply carved than the Yaqui one, in that the chin is not undercut, and teeth and tongue are not always shown. The eyes, in contrast to those on the Yaqui masks, are often round. The average dimensions of the masks from this area are 19.7 cm. by 12.7 cm., although it must be noted that only six masks have been collected and measured. Border and side designs are lacking on some masks, and when they are present, they tend to be incised and not painted. Human faced masks often have an incised line or row of triangles surrounding the upper face, from the outer corners of the eyes to the edges of the mouth. Due to their comparative sobriety of decoration, Sinaloa masks present a marked contrast to the other two styles described, and especially to Rio Mayo masks. The arrangement of hair on the Sinaloa masks also differs from that in the other two areas. The brows are roached in the center, leaving two or three long tufts on each side which hang down, framing the face. The beard is left long, and averages 30.5 cm., or 1.55 times the length of the wooden part of the mask. Horsehair is used exclusively. Little is known concerning the appearance of older masks in this area, as no dated specimens have been found which were collected earlier than 1965. From the few older masks observed in the field, it can be postulated that this area has seen less change in the appearance of pascola masks than the other two. No pascola masks are currently being made for sale to non-Mayos. MINIATURE MASKS Miniature masks are made by both Yaquis and Sonora Mayos, although only one of the latter has been observed. Hints at ethnographic use among the Yaquis are too vague to enumerate here, with one exception. Dr. Edward Spicer of the University of Arizona has a miniature mask that was used at Pascua Village, Tucson, by a masked Chapayeka in an Easter ceremony. He held it in his hand and dangled it in front of the maestro 's face when the latter official was reading prayers (Spicer: personal communication). Mayos deny any ceremonial use for miniatures. In quality and general appearance 195</page><page sequence="12">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 Figure 9 Figure 10 Figure 9. Sinaloa pascola mask made in the 1940's by Juan Bacasewa of Garbanzos, Sinaloa. The face is scraped bare, a common occurrence in Sinaloa masks. There is a faintly incised row of small triangles from the outer corners of the eyes to the corners of the mouth. The flower on the forehead is of plastic, while the teeth are bits of a glass plate. The hair on this and the following mask is typical for Sinaloa in the length of the beard and outer brows, while the inner brows are cut short. The colors are black and brown (possibly a stain).

The colors are black and white. the minature masks run from excellent small reproductions of pascola masks to crudely carved, sloppily painted curios. MEANING AND ICONOGRAPHY Along with the other fiesta dancers and musicians, the Cihitan pascola is involved in a loosely organized cult or series of beliefs and practices called "the religion of the woods" (Beals 1945:202). He gets his power from the yoania, or world of the woods, as well as from the Christian God. Power in the yo 2ania is often associated with various animals of the woods and desert. These are called by Yaquis "the little animals of the pascola" (Painter manuscript), and include the lizard whose form appears on the sides of Yaqui masks. Other animals of great importance to the pascola are the goat and the snake. These two animals appear in dreams to boys who have the duty and power to become involved in the fiesta arts. These appearances involve a 196</page><page sequence="13">Vol. 37, No. 4 THE KIVA threat on the part of the animal, which must be met bravely if the individual in question is going to be able to become a pascola or a musician (Painter manuscript). In view of this, it is not surprising to discover that many items of pascola equipment, including the mask, are associated with the snake or the goat. The triangular flaps on the back of the pascola's leg wrappings have been described as being the hair on the flanks of the goat. The ridge pole of the harp and the bow of the violin may be called "snake". Although some masks are actually carved to resemble goat faces, the author has been told by informants that all pascola masks depict goats. The triangles that appear on the borders of many masks have been described by one Yaqui as being goats' teeth (Painter manuscript). The iconography of pascola masks is by no means restricted to references to the yo ?ania. In reference to pascola regalia as a whole, Painter states that "The sign of the Cross is frequently employed, and the regalia is dedicated to Jesus, as is the pascola himself' (Painter manuscript). The function of the central cross that almost always appears on the forehead of pascola masks is to protect the wearer against witches, who present a constant source of danger to the pascola during his performance. On two occasions the author has commented to Mayo mask carvers that the masks they made for sale to him had no crosses. In each case, the answer was on the order of: "You aren't going to dance pascola. Why do you need a cross?" One man added that if one were to use the mask to dance with, a cross could always be marked on it with pencil. Flowers are extremely important in Yaqui and Mayo ceremonialism. They appear or are represented on altars, on pascolas' topknots, and on various items of equipment used by all classes of Cahitan ceremonialists. Many items of ceremonial equipment are called "flower" by Yaquis (Spicer 1965:126). Elaborate flower symbolism is found in Yaqui deer dance songs (Spicer 1965:122-7), and flowers are sometimes used to represent the blood of Christ and the Grace of Heaven (Spicer 1964:33). In the light of all this, it is not very surprising to find that flowers, leaves and plant forms are constantly occurring on pascola masks from the entire Cihitan area. These forms are more common on older masks, however, and it may be that this and other pascola lore is not being transmitted to younger pascolas at the same rate as such external manifestations of the complex as, for instance, dance steps and joking patterns. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This article is based upon intermittent field work in Arizona, Sonora and Sinaloa between 1965 and 1970. Portions of that work were funded by the Eben F. Comins Fund of the Department of Anthropology, University of Arizona, and by the Taylor Museum of the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. I am grateful to both sets of 197</page><page sequence="14">THE KIVA Vol. 37, No. 4 administrators involved. While in the field, I depended upon the patience, knowledge and good will of countless people, including many pascolas. I am especially indebted to two men. Profesor Conrado Espinoza, late of Barobampo, Sinaloa, provided the introduc- tions that got the whole project started, and continued to help in many ways. Julio Siaruki, Kobanaro of the village of San Pedro, Sonora, was indispensable in his role of guide and interpreter. Without the help of these two and all the others I would have learned precious little about pascolas and their equipment. Back in the United States, officials of the Smithsonian Institution, the American Museum of Natural History, the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, the Southwest Museum, and the Arizona State Museum, kindly allowed me to examine and photograph material in their collections. Several friends and colleagues offered advice and information. Among these the following stand out: Dr. Edward Spicer of the University of Arizona, Mrs. Muriel Thayer Painter of Tucson, and the late Tom Bahti, also of Tucson. All these people contributed most of whatever is of value in this paper. I reserve to myself total credit for all mistakes. Dana Slaymaker of Rancho Linda Vista did the specimen photography. Finally, I must admit that I can never express my gratitude to my wife Loma and my children Kelly and David. They were along on much of the field work and suffered through the writing and worrying.
