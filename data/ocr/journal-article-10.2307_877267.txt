<plain_text><page sequence="1">Late Gothic Painting in Salzburg Visitors to Salzburg might well be excused for being unaware that the town once concerned itself with a great deal more than the tourist trade and the sound of music. Long before the birth of Mozart, the town was the seat of an archbishop whose ecclesiastical and political authority extended far beyond the limits of the present province, exercising dominance over tracts of the Tyrol, Bavaria and some parts of Carinthia, Styria and Carniola. The paintings produced in this diffuse area from 1400oo to 1530 were the subject of the exhibition Spdtgotik in Salzburg - Die Malerei which ran from last May to October at the Museum Carolino- Augusteum. A major event, it has received little mention in the English press. A retrospective note might therefore be of interest. The 316 exhibits comprised mainly panel paintings but included illuminated manuscripts, glass, embroidery and one notable sculpture from a composite altar. In the earliest works on display, there was no evidence of the landscape painting which was to be of such importance to the establishment of the Danube School. The paintings of the first years of the fifteenth century show the foundation of the Salz- burg School's reliance on the figure as almost the sole element of its vocabulary. The Bohemian Weiche Stil and the massive forms of the Italian trecento are uneasily amalgamated into a retrograde art, whose effect, primitive and iconic, is choral rather than narrative. This style is super- ceded by works which partake of the general movement towards a more natural- istic principle, and several paintings (eg. those by the Master of Laufen) establish, by the mid-century, a manner aptly described as 'derb-realistisch'. Almost all the works necessary for a complete examina- tion of this development, and of the other recognizable tendencies of the period (eg. the stolid block-like forms of the Hallein altar), were on display. The catalogue sensibly gave important missing paintings a full entry under the heading Desiderata and the seminal Altmiihldorf Crucifixion (unavailable because of its condition) was even accorded an illustration. Conrad Laib was the earliest named artist to be represented, although his major Crucifixion of 1449 unfortunately did not travel from Vienna. Its inscription, ALS ICH CHUN, has been said to be an avowal of Eyckian artistic aims, but seemed hardly apposite to the works on display. His panels showing Sts Hermes and Primus are, however, clearly important, their figures demonstrating a physical mass and heroic personality unprece- dented in Austria. Altichiero's Paduan wall-paintings, which Laib studied, were certainly catalytic but the ultimate source of St Hermes's alert turn and swinging tension must surely have been some memory of the Apollo Belvedere. This derivation from the antique is less sur- prising when one considers the Sterzing Wings (painted almost contemporane- ously in Ulm) whose painter clearly had access to patterns based on antique sculpture. The comparison serves only to clarify Laib's more successful translation of his source. The Sterzing Master's choice of the Spinario as his model (for St Joseph drying his feet) gives evidence of his limitation to an aesthetic of homely naturalistic detail, akin to some Nether- landish work. Majestic in both physique and emotion, Laib's St Hermes seems to achieve a more direct rendering of the psychological atmosphere of antique sculp- ture. Unconcerned with landscape or interior settings, Laib's success in terms of the figure is greater, because his concen- tration upon it is so. The school's emphasis upon the figure results in its inventions being totally figure-orientated - characterization, ges- ture, expression, rhythm and handling of paint being the main tools. There is, therefore, a greater tolerance of clearly visible brushstrokes, of a more clearly- apparent facture than there is, say, in the painting of the Netherlandish or Cologne schools where the brushstroke becomes completely subservient to the task of a naturalistic reproduction of minutiae. This point was made clear by the presence in the exhibition rooms of the museum's Adoration triptych by the Master of the Virgo inter Virgines. Much of the history of Salzburg painting in the second half of the fifteenth century is devoted to the incursion of Netherland- ish interiors and to the development of spatial settings generally. Nevertheless the major masters preserve the main tenets which were established in the first part of the century and brought to a peak by Laib. The very scale (8 ft. high) of the Salvator Mundi by Rueland Frueauf the Elder speaks of an intensification of a figure- based art. Frueauf's dramatic presentation of monumental figures in the foreground plane is perhaps best known to English scholars through his masterly Man of Sorrows (Munich) which gives, however, no indication of his legacy to his son - landscape. It was unfortunate that there was no indication in the exhibition, of his command of this genre, so apparent in his large Agony in the Garden (Vienna). Instead, the panels from Grossgmain (once attribu- ted to Frueauf the Elder and now gener- ally labelled Master of Grossgmain) took on the onus of representing a stage of developing spatial awareness. Their al- most hallucinatory brilliance of colour prepared one for the sharp effects of Rueland Frueauf the Younger's many- figured Crucifixion of 1496 from Kloster- neuburg. This smallish picture, developing the taste for visible brushwork, is painted thinly, freely and swiftly, some of its passages being akin to those in a brush drawing. The bustling, almost gay crowd around the three crosses has, as its back- ground, a full panoramic landscape whose trees and slopes, freely-drawn in high colour, contain the embryo of the Danube style in their springing rhythms and anthropomorphic swellings, at once natur- alistic and fantastic. Frueauf's feeling for the power and meaning of nature is exemplified by his characterizations of the trees on which hang the crucified thieves. The Good Thief dangles from an almost straight ash whose healthy green tufts speak of the beginning of his salvation. Doubled agonizingly around an equally contorted tree, the Bad Thief's ghastly red hair rhymes in colour with the autumnal leaves on the dead trunk - an image of death in the provinces of both nature and man. The great achievement of the exhibition was to make the story of Salzburg painting so available to the public. Some elements of the display were particularly pleasing - the inclusion of a reconstruction of Michael Pacher's Salzburg altar next to the parts of it which were on display; the use of ektachromes to illustrate manu- script pages which could not always be open. Scholars will, perhaps, be most grateful for the catalogue which must become a standard work on the subject. 198</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT AND FORTHCOMING EXHIBITIONS Up-to-date enough to take into considera- tion Elfriede Baum's important Katalog des Museums mittelalterlicher 6esterreichischer KIunst (Vienna, 1971), and conscientious enough to rehearse the opinions of all the main scholars in the field, it also provided some summary essays which must have proved helpful for those unfamiliar with the field. While the exhibition was specialist by nature, the general visitor's appreciation of Salzburg's spectacular skyline could only have been extended by seeing some of the first paintings to attempt a rendering of the town's ever-changeful personality.
