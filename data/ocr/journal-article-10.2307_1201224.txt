<plain_text><page sequence="1">FEUERBACH, BARTH, AND THEOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY JOSEPH C. WEBER* I N His book, Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone, written near the end of his life, Kant wrote: "We create a God for ourselves, and we create Him in the form in which we believe we shall be able most easily to win Him over to our advantage."' With this statement Kant anticipated a development in modern thinking about religion which has come to domi- nate much of our contemporary dis- cussion in psychology, sociology, and "theology." Kant was not interested in attacking religion as such. On the contrary, he wanted to interpret religion so that it would serve as a support for the moral duty of man. In the "Transcendental Dialectic" of his Critique of Pure Rea- son, Kant destroyed the epistemological basis of any knowledge about God which traditional metaphysics had de- veloped. But Kant wanted to keep the "idea of God" as a postulate necessary for the enforcement of rational mo- rality.2 He warned, however, that one must not think that one has objective or assertive knowledge about God. If, either through metaphysics or revela- tion, man thinks that he knows God Himself, this would lead him to the false illusion of serving God Himself and not to the main task of carrying out his rational, moral duty under the moral imperative. Kant would not ob- ject to the language of the Bible-even its anthropological way of speaking about God-if this is helpful in making clear to the average person the meaning of the idea of God for the moral life. But such language must not be mis- taken for a "schematism of objective determination."3 In speaking about God, man is not dealing with a tran- scendent, objective reality, but with a postulate which he makes to serve a specific, moral function. This interpretation of the idea of God was more than a psychological or phenomenological explanation because it rested upon Kant's understanding of human freedom. Freedom, for Kant, was not limited to the phenomenal world, but participated in the noumenal world. Indeed, it was the problem of freedom, just as much as his specula- tion about things in themselves, that led Kant to speculate about the reality of the noumenal world and its relation- ship to phenomena. Kant's speculation about the relationship of the noumenal and phenomenal worlds-a relationship which could not be the object of theo- retical knowledge-opened the way for the period of German Idealism. For forty years German Idealism sought to think out the relationship between Kant's noumenal and phe- * Joseph Cottrell Weber is associate professor of New Testament at the Methodist Theological School in Ohio.

Underlying the think- ing of both the Romanticists and the speculative Idealists was a common vision. They all had a vision of the ultimate unity of thought and being. Either in the mystery of feeling, or in the seriousness of the encounter with another "thou," or in speculative thought, man transcends himself to un- derstand, or experience, or feel the ultimate unity of reality. He compre- hends the absolute; he knows or expe- riences God. Such a vision, which has its roots deep in Western culture, was able for a while to hold off the final implications of the Enlightenment. It nourished and supported faith in a transcendent reality. It was a meta- physical vision of faith which served as a kind of epistemological ground for knowledge of God. For Schleier- macher it made possible a completely new beginning in theology. Schleier- macher's The Christian Faith is really a phenomenology of religion.4 But it is not just a description of the essence of human religion because Schleiermacher shared the vision of the ultimate unity of feeling and being. He could assume the reality of God because on the basis of this vision he believed God to be ac- tually given in a dimension of human experience. Even for Hegel the vision serves as the basis of his system. He does not overcome Kant by a strict epistemological analysis. His funda- mental affirmation of the identity of thought and being rests on the meta- physical vision with which he begins. 1841 marked the beginning of a new era in modern thought. Forces came onto the historical scene that radically undermined this metaphysical vision of faith in all its expressions. The En- lightenment was to bear universal cul- tural fruit in the nineteenth century. Ludwig Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity was one of the most im- portant works which led to this estab- lishment of a new modern era. Com- pared to Hegel's system this work by Feuerbach is trite. But it served a critically destructive function. One might compare Hegel's system to an intricately built tower of blocks such as a child builds. In order to destroy it one does not have to build another tower. One just has to pull out one of the supporting blocks, and the tower comes crashing down. Feuerbach pulled out one of the supporting blocks. He wrote a phenomenological analy- sis of Christianity in which he gave a psychological explanation for the ori- gin of both the vision of Idealism and biblical revelation. "God is the most real subjective essence of man sepa- rated and distinguished from him- self."5 This is the central theme of Feuerbach's work on religion. God is the image which man has of himself as a member of the human race and which he then projects out upon a screen of objectivity. "Man-this is the mystery of religion-projects his being into objectivity, and, then again makes himself an object to this projected image of himself thus converted into a subject."" In these sentences Feuerbach has proposed a psychogenetic explana- tion of both the origin and nature of religion. The ground of religion is not in some transcendent reality, but in the concrete reality of man himself. In Feuerbach we do not find just the ab- stract, intellectual hypotheses of the Enlightenment. Rather, we find a phenomenological analysis of religion as an inherent moment in the existence</page><page sequence="3">26 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION of man as a concrete psychological and sociological being. Man is different from the beasts be- cause he has self-consciousness. He is conscious of himself as an individual and as a member of the species. He is in relationship with himself as both I and Thou. His consciousness is infinite- ly richer than that of the beasts. The process through which this conscious- ness of self and of the species is de- veloped and consummated is a process of objectification. Man projects the ele- ments of his own nature out upon ob- jectivity. He is conscious of himself in relationship to these objectifications. They serve as the means whereby man comes into relationship with himself and with the human species. Religion is one moment in this primitive, original life of man in coming to consciousness of himself as a peculiar individual and as a member of his species. Man's own nature, threatened by limitation, un- fulfilment, and by extinction, is pro- jected out upon an objective reality and raised to infinity. Such a process accounts for the origin of the idea of the gods and of God in world religions. All of the absolute attributes ascribed to God are in reality human attributes.7 Distinguished and detached from the nature of man, and combined with the idea of God, the infinite fulness of various predicates is a conception without reality, a mere phantasy, a conception derived from the sensible world.8 In The Essence of Christianity Feuer- bach has worked out an analysis of both the metaphysical idea of God as the Absolute and the idea of God as person in the biblical revelation. The idea of God as person is the end to which all religion strives because in the absolute person of God man has achieved the most perfect projection of himself. Anthropomorphic language is not an analogical way of speaking about the transcendent God but really the obvious manifestation of man's own projection of himself. When we think that we are speaking analogically about God, we are really speaking analogi- cally of man. This analysis is then carried out in regard to the basic idea contained in biblical revelation. Man pictures God as morally perfect and as holy judge because he fufils in this projection the demands of his own conscience for moral perfection which he cannot fully attain in his individual, empirical ex- istence. God is conceived as love be- cause man thereby overcomes the great chasm separating himself from his image of God. God's loving man means that man through God loves himself. The secret of God's love is man's de- sire to be free for love. But not for an abstract, spiritual love. Rather, the real secret of this love is man himself. The fundamental theme is that all the predi- cates applied to the idea of God are really predicates of man. The tragedy of religion, according to Feuerbach, is that man does not realize that the objectifications he has painted upon the absoluteness of objectivity are really images of his own nature. He has assigned reality to the illusion. He attributes more reality to his idea of God than he does to his own concrete existence. This prevents him from see- ing man as the true ens realissimum. It keeps him from loving man as man. Therefore, religion is the cause of alienation. Although it serves the func- tion of bringing man to his full self- consciousness, in our modern times it has alienated man from his true self.</page><page sequence="4">FEUERBACH, BARTH, AND THEOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY 27 In Hegel, from whom Feuerbach learned this concept, alienation is grounded in the reality of the meta- physical dialectic of the absolute spirit. Feuerbach reduces alienation to the process of the human consciousness coming to full realization of itself as part of the species. It is a fully human process. In the process of coming to consciousness man turns away from himself and relates to the objectifica- tions of himself as if they had inde- pendent objectivity. It is the irony of this process that man tries to escape from himself into the illusion of his own objectified nature projected into an infinite, absolute dimension which has no real existence in the concrete, material world. There is no meta- physical alienation and no alienation from the holy transcendent God. Rath- er, in religion man is actually alienated from himself." The actual reality of metaphysics and revelation is reduced to the reality of the concrete existing man becoming conscious of himself as a member of the species. The ultimate reality of religion is not the transcendent God, but man himself. Feuerbach does not wish to destroy religion. Rather, religion must be freed from its subjection to the illusory ob- jectifications which man has projected. Religion must be evaluated anew in light of the service it should perform for a common humanity. Feuerbach has a positive view of Christianity be- cause in it one can see the goal of all religion. Christianity not only has the idea of God as person, but this person has actually become incarnate in a human person in history. Thus in Christianity one can see the true con- cern of religion: So far the Christian religion may justly be called the absolute religion. That God, who in himself is nothing else than the nature of man, should also have a real existence as such, should be an object of the consciousness-this is the goal of religion; and this the Christian religion has attained in the incarnation of God.lo Feuerbach's purpose is to free re- ligion from its illusion of objective transcendence and to free it for its ulti- mate purpose: the realization of love among men. As long as man ascribes ultimate reality to the God whom he has created outside of himself, he is prevented from loving humanity. God is love. But it is just as true that love is God. The predicate is also the sub- ject." Theology is reduced to anthro- pology for the sake of love. Thus Christ, as the consciousness of love, is the consciousness of the species. He there- fore who loves man for the sake of man, who rises to the love of the species, to universal love, adequate to the nature of the species, he is a Christian, is Christ himself.12 The origin, nature, and purpose of religion is found in man himself as a member of the human species. Religion must be disrobed of false reference to objectivity, of concepts that supposedly refer to a realm that transcends human existence. "We create God for our- selves." This "we" now is the concrete, empirical "we" of common humanity. Now it is deprived of any possibility of postulating some kind of noumenal world. The metaphysical vision of the Christian world is dissolved into em- pirical anthropology. Feuerbach marks a beginning of a new epoch in Western thought. His significance for Christian theology can hardly be overestimated. He helped change not only the thought of western Europe, but also the social and political</page><page sequence="5">28 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION makeup of Europe. He is the forerun- ner of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. His theory of religion, in spite of the criti- cism and modification it underwent, re- mains the model of the psychological, sociological explanation of the origin and nature of religion that dominates much of the modern world.13 It is essential to realize that Feuer- bach's position presupposes Kant's de- struction of natural theology. Without the "Transcendental Dialectic" of The Critique of Pure Reason, Feuerbach's theory of religion would be impossible. His theses could be dismissed as purely psychological hypotheses without any metaphysical significance. Reason it- self could establish the objective valid- ity of the idea of God. It could then dismiss Feuerbach's work as simply superficial psychology. Because of Kant's careful investigation in his Cri- tique of Pure Reason which limits ra- tional, theoretical knowledge to the phenomenal world, such an easy dis- missal of Feuerbach is not possible. It is true that Feuerbach's argu- mentation is not supported by a strictly logical or empirical investigation. He simply proposes to reveal the true es- sence of religion by pointing to it. It is not a historical description, but an analysis of the real intention of the phenomenon of religion. Such an ap- proach does not admit of clear-cut proof either in terms of logic or of em- pirical verification. In itself Feuer- bach's work cannot claim to decide the question of the objective truth of re- ligious claims. A psychological or so- ciological explanation of the origin of religious consciousness does not auto- matically destroy the truth of the re- ality of God. In order to retain its ob- jective validity, however, this truth would have to be established on some other basis than religious experience. Such a basis appears not to be pos- sible. Reason cannot do it itself. If one would try to argue for the ob- jective validity of the idea of God from the actual presence of this idea in hu- man culture, Feuerbach would be able to point out that the truth of such vision is in man himself. He would be able to account for the origin of this vision in man himself. The presence of the idea or the vision of God is no ade- quate foundation upon which to estab- lish the transcendent reality of God. Such a standpoint would be even weak- er than the traditional ontological argu- ment for God's existence. The presence of a vision of God in our culture and the presence of an intense personal re- ligious experience fit very well into Feuerbach's explanation of religion. Feuerbach's answer is already given: "The divine nature which is discerned by feeling is in truth nothing else than feeling enraptured, in ecstasy with it- self.""' How would Christian theology re- spond to this challenge? The theolo- gians saw as their chief task the attempt to demonstrate the possibility of Chris- tian revelation-in some way-in the modern world. The dominant theolo- gian in Germany toward the end of the century, Albrecht Ritschl, tried to establish a kind of epistemology that would allow the possibility of some kind of "perception" of God."5 Ritschl ve- hemently denied the possibility of knowing God in Himself. Rather, we know God's meaning for us when we execute a "value judgment" about the significance of the historical Jesus for us. He seemed unwittingly almost to agree with Feuerbach. In spite of his</page><page sequence="6">FEUERBACH, BARTH, AND THEOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY 29 trying to tie faith to the historical Jesus, faith's real origin is in the value judgment of the believer. It is difficult to see how such a theology could de- fend itself against Feuerbach's ques- tion. If Ritschlian theology had really felt the threat of Feuerbach's reduction, one wonders whether it could have finally convinced even itself that the- ology had to do with anything more than the expression of man in his quest of humanity: precisely, man making value judgments about the meaning of God for man. At the beginning of our century there were attempts made to revive the vision of Idealism and Romanticism in some modified form. One of the most significant examples of this attempt was the thought of Ernst Troeltsch. Acutely aware of the relativity of history, Troeltsch denied the possibility of viewing any one event in history as the unique and absolute revelation of God. Rather, all of history must be seen as the mysterious unfolding of the Divine Life "in always-new and always-peculiar individualizations."16 Such a position reaches back through Hegel to Schleiermacher and to German Romanticism. Troeltsch affirms the truth of all religions to be their mani- fold manifestation of the Divine Life. But why must we introduce the idea of the Divine Life? Feuerbach could very well point out that such a concept is a vague metaphysical projection of hu- man understanding." The truth of all religions is not their participation in some Divine Life, but their truth is to be seen in the fact that men project the reality of their own nature into some kind of ego-transcendence. Then we are left with only the threatening relativity of history and with man's desperate attempt to transcend himself in the illusion of some transempirical reality. Feuerbach's reduction of theology to anthropology proves to be perhaps the most crucial test of a theological meth- od. Karl Barth was fully aware of this challenge to theology made by Feuer- bach's position. Part of the pathos of his attack upon the neo-Protestantism of the nineteenth century was deter- mined by Barth's conviction that this theology had unwittingly surrendered to Feuerbach. His concern with the Feuerbach question extends from the earliest of his theological writings up through to the last published half- volume of the Church Dogmatics. The Church Dogmatics might very well bear the subtitle, "Nein, against Lud- wig Feuerbach!"'8 The relevancy and intention of Barth's theology can be completely understood and appreciated only when one sees it exorcising Feuer- bach's ghost. The major methodological principles underlying the Church Dog- matics can be interpreted as means by which Barth combats Feuerbach's re- duction of theology to anthropology. Barth insists that theology must be- gin with the actuality of revelation. We cannot first inquire into the possibility of revelation in order to test the truth of any actually given revelation. If theology did not begin with the actual givenness of revelation, it could not move beyond a purely anthropological dimension. Any explanation of the pos- sibility of revelation, any explanation of a possible criterion of revelation, can only be an explanation of man's own potentiality. Revelation as some- thing possible, as something inherently understandable to man, is then only another name for some dimension of</page><page sequence="7">30 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION human existence. Barth continually points out that the question of God's revelation in Jesus Christ can never be raised a priori, but only a posteriori. We can only talk about it, test it, and discuss it on the basis of its really and truly having happened as God's revela- tion. There is no way of moving behind this point of ultimate beginning for theology.19 Theology must begin with the ac- tuality of this revelation. There is no way of going behind its actuality to substantiate its possibility or its mean- ing from some other standpoint. If one tries to move behind the actuality of revelation to assure its validity or its truth from some other standpoint, this other standpoint can be only some di- mension of man's experience or rea- son. Then the only possibility will be that "the revelation of God is nothing else than the revelation, the self- unfolding of human nature."20 By be- ginning with the actual givenness of God's revelation in Jesus Christ and by rejecting any attempt to show the possibility of understanding this revela- tion a priori, Barth has attempted to build a theology that is not vulnerable to Feuerbach. This helps to explain why Barth so strongly refuses to make use of an analogia entis. There is no inherent possibility of speaking truly of God as He is in terms of an analogy between the finite world and its infinite creator. Under the criticism of Feuer- bach's position, such an analogy can be reduced to the analogy between the nature of man and its projection into objectivity. The possibility of truly speaking about the Holy God is estab- lished only in the actuality of His hav- ing revealed Himself to man. Man's speaking about God is a gift of God's revelation itself to man in faith. Barth affirms that we can truly speak of God only on the basis of this gift of faith. Theology is grounded not in an analogia entis, but in an analogia fidei.2' Any attempt to justify our speaking about God analogically upon some oth- er basis than His Self-revelation can only lead to the recognition that this language is the anthropomorphic im- agery of man's self-objectification. Barth's second basic affirmation which supports the Church Dogmatics is that in God's revelation in Jesus Christ we have to do with God Himself as He really is in Himself. Indeed, Barth can say that our knowledge of God is really God's knowledge of Him- self in which we, through His grace, are permitted to participate. If the knowl- edge we have of God in His revelation is to be true and real and not illusory, it must be knowledge of God in Him- self. If it were merely knowledge of God as He appears to be for us in this one event, then we could not protect ourselves from the doubt that we may not have to do with God, but only with ourselves. We do not have to do in Jesus Christ with just some deus pro nobis whose relationship to the Holy God is beyond any possibility of know- ing. If that were so, then we would not really know God and could not dis- tinguish this revelation in Jesus Christ from our own longings, desires, and hopes. Barth is very much concerned to assure just what Feuerbach denied: "Man's knowledge of God is God's knowledge of himself? The true state- ment is this: man's knowledge of God is man's knowledge of himself."22 Therefore, we find repeated continually throughout the Church Dogmatics that in Jesus Christ we have to do with the</page><page sequence="8">FEUERBACH, BARTH, AND THEOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY 31 very God Himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.23 In a third fundamental principle of the Church Dogmatics, closely related to the two preceeding ones, we can see even more directly Barth's reaction to Feuerbach. This appears in Barth's dis- cussion of the relationship between re- ligion and revelation. Barth makes clear that religion and revelation in Jesus Christ do not belong to the same realm. They are not two aspects of the same reality. Revelation does not fit into re- ligion as though religion were a vessel possessed by all men into which revela- tion is poured. Rather, revelation in Jesus Christ is the contradiction of all religion. Religion is actually the highest and sublimest expression of man's self- justification. The possibility and truth of revelation are not demonstrated by showing the reality of man's religion. At this point Barth agrees with Feuer- bach. In religion man has to do with himself not with the Holy God. Barth writes: From the standpoint of revelation religion is clearly seen to be a human attempt to an- ticipate what God in His revelation wills to do and does do. It is the attempted replace- ment of the divine word by a human manu- facture. The divine reality offered and mani- fested to us in revelation is replaced by a concept of God arbitrarily and willfully evolved by man.24 One would misunderstand Barth's intention if one were to regard his in- terpretation of all religion as simply an expression of cold intolerance. The real purpose is to establish a theological method that is not of itself susceptible to a Feuerbachian reduction to psy- chology or sociology or general human culture. If revelation and religion were necessarily complementary, then reve- lation would be brought into the realm of religion-a realm where, Barth agrees, the wishes, the strivings, the highest dreams of humanity find ex- pression. This expression may some- times be on a sublime level, but it is still an expression of humanity. The language of religion has to do with man projecting some of the many at- tributes of his nature into some kind of objectivity. Religion, for Feuerbach, expresses man's alienation from him- self, from his true concrete humanity. For Barth this alienation of man from his true humanity is only an expression of a deeper alienation. Religion is an expression of man's alienation from the Holy God; it is an expression of man's self-justification.25 How can Barth dare to agree with Feuerbach about the basic nature of religion? Obviously because in contrast to much or most other theology he does not intend to lay a foundation for Christian revelation either in a rational, natural theology or in some kind of anthropological a priori. He does not feel the need continually to enter the fray to defend the cause of religion against all the host of antagonists of the last hundred years. Why is this so? For the answer we must look at the basic principles of Barth's theology which we sketched above. He simply and consistently begins with the actual- ity of the revelation in Jesus Christ. And he simply affirms as the sine qua non of Christian theology that this is the self-revelation of the Holy God Himself. The actuality of Christian faith called forth by God's revelation in Jesus Christ presupposes that in this revelation we do not have to do with religion, or just with man, but with the Holy God Himself as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.26 Only upon this founda-</page><page sequence="9">32 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION tion can theology hope to resist any Feuerbachian attack. But we must ask: Has Barth real- ly repulsed Feuerbach's attack? Has he clearly overcome Feuerbach? Has Feuerbach's reduction of theology to anthropology been rendered impossible by Barthian theology? Regarded from one standpoint, these questions must be answered in the neg- ative. Barthian theology may regard itself to be more secure from the at- tacks of Feuerbach because it in no way tries to establish the validity of talking about revelation in some hu- man possibility. But when Barth shows that revelation is not open to normal means of verification, this could mean that it is in no way verifiable. It would then be meaningless to try to under- stand revelation as Barth does. When we look closer at Barth's theology we see that the ultimate verification of revelation appears to be in the faith of the believer who confesses that this faith is not his own possibility. Rather, it is grounded in God's revelation in Jesus Christ. But can one then not respond by pointing out that in fact the actuality of revelation is just the actuality of the subjective faith of the believer? When this movement in Barth's the- ology is expressed in rational argumen- tation it becomes clear that theology is moving in a circle. The reality with which Barth theologically begins is the actuality of God's revelation in Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, we can see that this revelation is valid and real only for those who respond in faith. Those living in faith may attribute their faith to the actuality of God's revelation. For those outside of faith, this will ap- pear only as an illusory circular move- ment. For those outside of faith the objective validity of revelation will seem to be only the subjectivity of faith written large. Feuerbach ap- parently has given an appropriate response even to Barth's theology: "What then is faith but the infinite self-certainty of man, the undoubting certainty that his own subjective being is the objective, absolute being, the being of beings?""27 Every affirmation of some transcendent reality of one's idea, or vision, or concept of God can be sucked down into the vortex of a phenomenological explanation. Feuer- bach has spoken a word in our modern culture that cannot be ultimately re- futed by rational argumentation. However, Barth has overcome Feuer- bach theologically. He has done so simply by taking the faith of the Church more seriously than Feuer- bach's attack on this faith. The final possibility for theology is the faith of the Church which inexorably refers us to the reality of God's revelation in Jesus Christ. The question of theologi- cal methodology that we have raised in this discussion of Feuerbach and Barth is not only an intellectual ques- tion of proper theological procedure, but involves also basically the possi- bility of theology at all. Barth clearly saw that unless theology begins with the actual revelation of God in Jesus Christ, it would spend all its strength trying to justify its own possibility. This would mean, in the end, the im- possibility of theology. There is another way to deal honest- ly with Feuerbach. That way is to agree with him. Then one does theology an- thropologically. The most well-known</page><page sequence="10">FEUERBACH, BARTH, AND THEOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY 33 example of this approach in our time is the work of John A. T. Robinson. In Honest to God he has written: If statements about God are statements about the "ultimacy" of personal relationship, then we must agree that in a real sense Feuerbach was right in wanting to translate "theology" into anthropology.28 Robinson attempts to make a certain differentiation between himself and Feuerbach by affirming "an awareness of the transcendent, the numinous, the unconditional.""29 Robinson then goes on to say that "theological statements are indeed affirmations about human existence-but they are affirmations about the ultimate ground and depth of that existence.""0 There is no reason why Feuerbach could not agree with these statements made by Robinson. In fact, Robinson's position is much closer to Feuerbach than he himself real- izes. He can only try to differentiate his position from Feuerbach because there is an implicit metaphysical as- sumption behind Robinson's words. He assigns a metaphysical reality to what he calls "the depth of being."3' But where is the foundation upon which he could support such a metaphysical presupposition? How can he protect it against a Feuerbachian reduction to anthropology? He can only maintain a supposed distinction from Feuerbach because he almost unwittingly reintro- duces to theology some form of Roman- ticism.32 Having already conceded so much to Feuerbach, Robinson can hardly hold on to some metaphysical remainder at the last minute. When Robinson tries to prevent a Feuerbach- ian reversal of "God is love" into "love is God," he introduces the authority of the First Epistle of John. If, how- ever, the ultimate meaning of "God is love" is derived from the depth of human experience,33 a reference to Scripture is woefully inadequate to prevent the Feuerbachian affirmation that love is God. Only if one were to agree that theological statements do have to do with God Himself can such a reference to Scripture have the the- ological power of preventing an inter- change of subject and predicate in "God is love." A more consistent expression of a modern position in accord with Feuer- bach is found in Paul Van Buren's The Secular Meaning of the Gospel."3 A summary statement made by Van Buren near the end of his work could very well be interpreted as a contem- porary statement of the positive theme of Feuerbach's The Essence of Chris- tianity: Statements of faith are to be interpreted, by means of the modified verification prin- ciple, as statements which express, describe, or commend a particular way of seeing the world, other men and oneself, and the way of life appropriate to such a perspective.35 Feuerbach's positive evaluation of re- ligious language was to strip it of its false metaphysical objectification and interpret it in terms of the function it has in the relationship of man to himself and to his fellow man. Although the general philosophical context in which both men carry out their work is different, they share this same fundamental methodological intention. There is a similar antithesis set up by both. Religious language either must be verifiable in a direct empirical man- ner, or else it can be interpreted only in terms of the function it serves in human existence. Clearly, the first pos-</page><page sequence="11">34 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION sibility is not acceptable. Therefore, both interpret religious language in terms of the second possibility. Van Buren interprets religious language as an expression of a "blik," that is, a primary, non-cognitive, non-explana- tory way of looking at the world. The validity of religious language is ascer- tained by illuminating the function it has in human existence." It appears quite legitimate to interpret Van Buren's position as a modern attempt to do "theology" in harmony with Feuer- bach. Both wish to reinterpret tradi- tional theological language by refer- ring it to its function in human exist- ence. Both regard statements about an "objective God" meaningless. Both wish to free Christianity from false cognitive language so that religion may free men to love one another. With both, theology-at least in any tradi- tional sense-is impossible. With both Van Buren and Robinson this attempt to do theology anthro- pologically leads to an introduction of the significance of the historical Jesus very much as in the tradition of Ritsch- lianism. However, in both of these mod- ern thinkers there is an attempt to relate faith to the empirical reality of history. Robinson speaks of "The Man for Others,"37 and Van Buren speaks of Jesus' "freedom." What is really hap- pening here is a historicizing of ker- ygmatic statements. We do not have enough historical evidence to know whether Jesus "was free from anxiety and the need to establish his own iden- tity," and "above all free for his neigh- bor."38 Even if such statements could be verified historically, it would be difficult to see just what this historical past would have to do with me. Van Buren says that Easter is "an experi- ence of seeing Jesus in a new way and sharing in the freedom which had been his."39 One might wonder whether sharing the freedom of a man dead for nearly two thousand years is really a modern, secular possibility. But the real weakness of such a position is that the person in faith has no ground for this faith outside of his own existence. His faith is just his "blik." Now this may suffice in many individuals. But there is no theological justification for faith. The man in faith has no refer- ence to the reality of God which could prevent the subversion of his faith by a purely psychogenetic explanation. His "blik" might be simply an expres- sion of his psychosociological situation. Reduced to anthropology, faith cannot overcome the exigencies of our human predicament. It is mocked by ambi- guity, tragedy, and finally by death. The other alternative is to learn from Barth that Christian theology must be- gin with the actuality of the revelation in Jesus Christ, and to affirm that we have to do there with the holy tran- scendent God Himself. We are engaged in a circular movement when we affirm this as a rational proposition. There is no way logically or rationally to break out of this circle. There is no way to banish Feuerbach except by the triumph of faith which is called forth by an event which it confesses to be God's revelation. Barth is aware of this: The point of our whole exposition is posi- tively: Credo ut intelligam, and polemically: "The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God." But is this not a petitio principii? Are we not arguing in a circle? Exactly! We have learned from the content of our presupposi- tion and assertion, and only from its content, that because it is true it is legitimate and obligatory. . . . Only fools can say in their</page><page sequence="12">FEUERBACH, BARTH, AND THEOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY 35 hearts that this is a circulus vitiosus, as though there could not also be, and in this case necessarily is, a circulus virtuosus as well.40 Our discussion of Feuerbach and Barth has made clear two distinct al- ternatives for a theological method. It seems questionable whether there are any other real alternatives for contem- porary Protestant theology. This does not mean at all that theology must be- come Barthian. There are varied pos- sibilities for the future development of theology. But it does mean that at all' points the initial primacy of the actual- ity of God's revelation in Jesus Christ is retained as a methodological prin-m ciple. The relation of this starting point to religion, to culture, and to reason and logic must be open to reformulation in every generation. But this starting point cannot be explained or justified by religion, or culture, or reason and logic. Therefore, at the conclusion of this discussion we can dare to say that faith does have a cognitive moment. Theol- ogy must affirm and clarify the episte- mological function of faith. It must reject the false antithesis that the lan- guage of Christian theology based on the biblical testimony to the Christ- event must either be open to normal empirical verification or else be ex-. plained in terms of the function it plays in human existence. To speak analogically of God is not really a pos- sibility of man. But it is an actuality we have through God's revelation in Jesus Christ. We simply cannot accept the other alternative that to assign any cognitive value to language spoken in faith in response to revelation is mean- ingless. We cannot accept this position because it would destroy the reality of both faith and revelation. This reality ultimately is founded not on a rational possibility, but on its own revelational actuality. We can be honestly aware of the skandalon of this position. It is a skan- dalon which belongs to every dimension of Christian existence. We have no way of overcoming this skandalon except as we confess that God Himself has done so in the Resurrection.

The references to the Church Dogmatics point to key passages, but they are not intended to be ex- haustive. Barth reaches this fundamental starting point of his theology most clearly in his book on Anselm of Canterbury. (Cf. Anselm: Fides Quaerens Intellectum, trans. Ian W.

This is a remainder of German Idealism which Robinson apparently has imported through Paul Tillich. It really cannot be reconciled to the religionless Christianity of Bonhoeffer.
