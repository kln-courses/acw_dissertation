<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aaron Siskind: Ideas in Photography Ronald J. Hill For nearly fifty years, Aaron Siskind has confronted the primary aesthetic issue of twentieth-century photography, the articulation of ideas in a medium that is inherently linked to the specificity of the phenomenal world. Always accepting photography as a recording medium, Siskind has worked in several styles in his attempt to make photo- graphs whose meaning is conveyed entirely within the picture yet not totally dependent on the subject. By striving to render all the elements of meaning strictly in pictorial terms, Siskind has led in the development of photography within the canons of modernist, self-critical image-making. He has worked in the country and city with inanimate subjects and people, pursuing various solutions to his formal and expressive requirements. In the evolution of his oeuvre, Siskind has produced and continues to produce images that are simple in appearance yet extremely com- plex in the statements they make regarding man's relation- ship to his environment and to other people. Thanks in great part to Robert Menschel's 1978 gift of twenty-five prints by Aaron Siskind to The Art Museum, the various ap- proaches by which Siskind has sought to express ideas in photographs are now clearly evident in the selection of his prints at Princeton. Starting photography in 1930, Siskind soon became deeply involved with his hobby.' He joined the New York Film and Photo League in 1932, hoping to learn more about the craft of photography. Although the League offered him a place to learn, to show his photographs, and to see work by other photographers, such as Berenice Abbott and Paul Strand, Siskind ended his association with the group in 1934 because of the way in which Communist party dogma, which had influenced several members, dictated what subjects and styles of presentation were suitable for League members' photographs.2 He was persuaded to rejoin the Photo League in 1936 (the filmmakers had left the organiza- tion) and became leader of the Feature Group, which was composed of photographers who "explored through a series of exercises the aesthetic of documentary."3 These exercises became documentary projects that were meant to produce social awareness and reform.4 While working on these projects for the League, Siskind was also working alone on photographs of architecture in Bucks County, Pennsylvania (1935); a documentary entitled The End of the Civic Repertory Theater (1938); and a study of the Martha's Vineyard Camp Meeting Association, which he called "Tab- ernacle City" (1932-40).5 When Siskind exhibited "Taberna- cle City" at the Photo League in May 1941, he was criticized for ignoring social issues to pursue formalist concerns.6 As a response to this criticism, Siskind left the Photo League and with it the belief that photography was solely a medium for conveying specific information to influence social change. From his experience with social documentary, Siskind has always retained his awareness of the ability of photogra- phy to record the phenomenal world in an accurate and convincing manner. While leading the Feature Group, he was also sensitive to the ways in which the photographer's choices can affect the viewer's perception of the subject.7 He found that the pretense of objective recording required the minimizing of the photographer's articulation of his role in making a photograph. After he left the Photo League, Siskind felt the need to make photographs that clearly recorded both the subject and his decisions regarding its appearance in the photograph. The problem was to him a crisis of subject matter: "I found I wasn't saying anything. Special meaning was not in the pictures but in the subject. I began to feel that reality was something that existed only in our minds and feelings."'8 By his efforts to give photographic form to this internal reality, Siskind began to seriously confront the problem of expressing subjective reality in a recording medium. Siskind's search for a new kind of image began at Gloucester, Massachusetts, during the summer of 1943. Working with no set program except the requirement that he make six exposures every morning, Siskind struggled through an unrewarding summer, photographing arrange- ments of objects found along the beach.9 Upon his return to New York City, where he worked as a high school English teacher, Siskind was asked by the painter Barnett Newman to photograph pieces of pre-Columbian sculpture for an exhibition Betty Parsons was organizing for the Wakefield Gallery."0 While photographing these works (figures 1 and 2), Siskind began to see how inanimate forms could possess the same energy that animates living forms. He realized the ways in which the pictorial means of framing, point of view, lighting, and background could all be used to accent the energy he sensed in the objects themselves. In these photographs, the stone sculptures are seen against a solid background (usually white, but in one case black)." The lighting accents the rugged surface qualities of the object, while the uniform background flattens the field in which it is seen, creating a tension in the image between the three- dimensional objects and their two-dimensional representa- tion. The absence of any scale indicators precludes reading the photographs as mere records of small statues against a plain ground, making a definitive reading of the image yet</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1 Aaron Siskind, American, born 1903: pre-Columbian head, 1943.

These difficulties in establishing an immedi- ate comprehension of the image direct our attention to the interaction of conflicting elements in the photograph. These visual conflicts became for Siskind both the means for creating stronger pictorial constructions and the ex- pressive equivalents for tensions in his own life. Resuming his efforts at Gloucester the following sum- mer, Siskind continued to examine the possibilities of images made by using arranged objects as subject matter. Here, he made the first significant pictures in the develop- ment of his mature style-photographs of a glove lying on a dock (Gloucester, 1944 [figure 3]) and of rope strands and seaweed lying on the beach (a similar though later example is Marthas Vineyard, ca. 1947 [figure 4]). Regarding these pictures, Siskind wrote in 1945: "For the first time in my life, subject matter, as such, had ceased to be of primary importance. Instead, I found myself involved in the rela- tionships of these objects, so much so that these pictures turned out to be deeply moving and personal experi- ences.'12 Both pictures continue the sharp focus and atten- tion to detail characteristic of his earlier documentary work, but the new element is the manner in which the ground completely fills the frame, bringing the image to the surface of the picture. This acceptance of the flat picture plane became the foundation for Siskind's pictorial struc- ture."3 While this aspect of his aesthetic program made 6</page><page sequence="4">7</page><page sequence="5">Siskind an innovator in the conception of pictorial form, other elements of his pictures are drawn from the canons of surrealism.4 In Gloucester, 1944, as in other surrealist compositions, the force of the image is derived from the tension between the standard context in which one expects to encounter the object and the pictorial context in which it actually appears. Siskind has altered the orientation in space of the glove, taking a familiar object lying on the ground and transforming it into an image to be hung on the wall. In this context, the glove seems to defy gravity, while being lit by a source outside our conventional world. A similar shift in orientation occurs in the rope and seaweed photographs. Seen as pictures on a wall, these appear very much like the automatist gestures that were another important aspect of surrealism. For painters of that era, the attraction of automatism consisted not only in the implied lack of conscious control of execution, but also in the ability of these personal gestures to accent the auto- graphic presence of the painter in the picture. In pho- tographing these "found gestures" Siskind often sought to indicate his activity in the making of the picture by finding strands that were twisted into the forms of his initials, a means of stressing autographic presence that recurs throughout Siskind's work. In the pictures made during the summer of 1944, Siskind continued to search for a pictorial tension that expressed conflicting forces. He titled his statement regard- ing these photographs "The Drama of Objects" and noted: Pressed for the meaning of these pictures, I should answer, obliquely, that they are informed with animism- not so much that these inanimate objects resemble the creatures of the animal world (as indeed they often do), but rather that they suggest the energy we usually associate with them. Aesthetically, they pretend to the resolution of these sometimes fierce, sometimes gentle, but always conflicting forces.15 Siskind's development from this point onward pursues the expression of relationships and forces increasingly in terms of the elements of pictorial construction. Discarding surrealist pictorial tension based on the conflict between the depicted object and its context, Siskind worked toward a new tension based on obscuring the recognizability of the subject by his use of various properties of the medium such as flattening the field of view, management of tones, and cropping. The visible effect of Siskind's use of these proper- ties marks the photograph as a picture-a unique, real object in its own right.16 In perceiving the potential mean- ings generated by the interaction of the subject and its photographic transformation into a picture, the viewer's efforts parallel those of Siskind, who said of his own photography in 1955, "The essential photographic act is recognition.:7 In his great stone landscapes, such as Marthas Vine- yard #105a, 1954 (figure 5), Siskind abstracted the subject and flattened the space by heightening the natural contrast of the scene. The sky becomes a blank, white shape without clouds or indication of aerial perspective. While the well-lit portions of the rocks are rendered with great clarity, their sculptural quality is contradicated by the shadowed areas that show no detail. In these flat areas of uniform tone, Siskind denied substance in order to create shapes that work as autonomous forces in the picture. These shapes reaffirm the flatness of the picture while the well-lit rock surfaces demand a placement in three-dimensional space in order to be comprehensible. While working in New York City, Siskind photographed architectural details such as 1 W 15, New York, 1947 (figure 6) and New York City W 1 (figure 7). As in the Martha's Vineyard pictures, Siskind exploited the tensions between form and shape. 1 W 15, New York plays on the corporeality of the ironwork and the shape of its shadow. The solidity of the railing is vitiated by its solid black tone showing no detail. Although projected into space, the shadow reads as a shape on the surface of the print. Thus, the viewer finds it difficult to determine a definitive relationship between solid and shape or figure and ground. This difficulty is even more evident in New York City W 1, in which the black shapes can serve as either the ground against which the window is viewed or as a form contiguous with the edges of the broken glass. In this picture, Siskind exercised great care to make the lattice frame of the window parallel to the edges of the picture. This careful placement of the subject to acknowledge the framing edges of the photograph is another means Siskind employed to signal his part in the making of the picture. The fact that the picture is now a self- contained world and that all the figures in that world are rendered in terms of a pictorial language is fully manifest in Siskind's choice to invert the subject. The classic photographs of Siskind's mature style are the wall pictures, which have engaged him almost con- tinually since 1944. While one of the earliest of these is Gloucester, 1944 (figure 8), the major portion of wall images has been made in an urban environment.

Later, Siskind exam- ined the use of intermediate gray tones that read with an indeterminate depth on the flatness of the wall. A consum- mate realization of picturemaking in this mode is Arizpe, Mexico 21, 1966 (figure 11). Within a structure of black verticals that parallel the sides of the frame, the multiplicity of gray tones establishes an advancing-receding tonal pat- tern of indeterminate depth. The obscenity scratched into the wall, however, asserts the true flatness of the wall. In addition, to insure that the image not be read simply as a record of a wall in Mexico, Siskind neglected to retouch 15</page><page sequence="13">Figure 12 Alfred Stieglitz, American, 1864-1946: Equivalent, 1927.

This photograph is a major achievement in Siskind's at- tempt to render meaning within a purely pictorial world- to have the statement contained wholly within the photo- graph and expressed entirely in terms relevant to the processes of photography: selection, framing, and manage- ment of tonal values. By working with a concept of photography in which images relate directly to the ideas and emotions of the photographer, Siskind consciously placed himself in a tradition masterfully articulated by Alfred Stieglitz in pic- tures he began making at Lake George, New York, in 1923 (figure 12).18 Although Siskind's images continue Stieglitz's concept of "equivalents," his photographs direct the viewer to a radically different perception of man's potential. Unlike Stieglitz, who found the equivalents of his emotional states in the interaction of clouds and sunlight and his sense of order in the world by the integration of natural and manmade forms, Siskind found embodiments of ideas and personal interrelationships in the static, inanimate, unin- tegrated detritus of the urban environment. Where Stieglitz's photographs seem resolved and final statements, the dualities fundamental to both Siskind's aesthetic and his perception of the world remain unresolved in his wall photographs. In keeping with the emerging abstract painting of the 1940s, Siskind's dualities were expressed primarily in terms of formal relationships and tensions. However, by calling many of these pictures "conversation pieces," Siskind sought to present photographed subjects as enactments of scenes from his personal life, engaged in a dialogue of interrelated gestures.19 By aesthetically distancing himself from often difficult personal relationships, Siskind gained both the ability to articulate more clearly the nature of relationships in modem cities and the means to move beyond a total concern with formal values. Choosing to find equivalents of human interaction in an inhuman environ- ment is in itself a critique of the kind of relationships such an environment fosters. Conceiving of these combinations of elements as interacting within a space that is sealed taut and flat becomes a statement on the kinds of communica- tion available in these "conversation pieces." Further, Sis- kind emphasized the futility of such communication by his use of actual examples of attempts to communicate in the urban environment: the impersonality and transience of the poster, the effort to impose oneself on the environment by writing on it, and the subsequent obliteration of that attempt by another, who tears down the poster or paints over the wall writings. By the nature of his choices, Siskind has found an economy of means to give powerful expres- sion to a reality that is uniquely his yet endemic to twentieth-century society. Siskind eventually found the means to redeem the contradictions of close personal relationships within an increasingly dehumanized environment. In the "Homage to Franz Kline" series, he has given his acceptance of the urban environment a positive character by associating it with one of the strongest positive personal emotions he has experienced, his friendship with Franz Kline.20 In their work (figures 13 and 14), they shared an approach that transformed the tensions of the city into an artistic state- ment by abstracting and aestheticizing its forces. It is this consonance of perceiving and utilizing the urban environ- ment that is celebrated in the pictures of the Kline series. As a celebration of a positive relationship, rather than a work- ing-out of difficult or troubled ones, these images reveal a world of greater freedom and more boldly inventive abstrac- tion in black and white than did the earlier wall pictures. While Siskind found positive connotations in his wall pictures by associating them with Franz Kline, the terms that governed the picture's appearance did not change. Siskind's aesthetic, defined in 1955 as "order with the tensions continuing," remains central to the Kline series. The Kline pictures still rely on the nearly absolute domina- tion of the subject by the photographer, which produces the reductive and apparently simple appearance of the photograph. Unable to control his existence in the phe- nomenal world, Siskind attempted to create in his pictures an equivalent symbolic world in which he had total control. Flat shapes fit perfectly within the frame imposed by the photographer, while the flattened space and framing edges allow nothing from the outside to interfere with the tightly organized world of the picture.21 Perhaps for this reason, Siskind's urban pictures have rarely included human subjects. In one such photograph, Durango, Mexico, 1961 (figure 15), Siskind obliterated the corporeality of the striding figure's form by rendering it as a 17</page><page sequence="15">Figure 13 Franz Kline, American, 1910-62: Mahoning, 1956, oil on canvas, 80 x 100 inches.

In addition, the blurred edges caused by the figure's movement destroy the clarity of the person's form. The figure and its shadow meld into a nearly continu- ous black shape. The wall, with its painted surface partially obscuring previous layers of painting, provides a more eloquent, succinct, and formally organized expression of this evanescence and continual change in that its ap- pearance incorporates even more visible traces of change accrued through a longer period of time. Siskind has photographed the human figure more consistently in the country. In his two series of the 1950s in which he photographed figures in the country, Siskind utilized many of the same formal ideas seen in the stone landscapes made at Martha's Vineyard. In the 1954 series entitled "The Terrors and Pleasures of Levitation" (figure 16), Siskind used the blank sky of the Martha's Vineyard pictures as a flat ground against which the bodies of boys jumping into Lake Michigan were silhouetted. The figure/ground tension and the lack of familiar spatial indicators are formal counterparts to the conflict between reading the figures as flat shapes or as corporeal forms. With his elements of pictorial construction Siskind produced a set of visual dualities that correlated to those expressed in his title. There is a greater sense of playfulness in the "Feet" series of 1957 (figure 17). Taking a part of the anatomy at which we usually look down, Siskind photographed feet against a blank sky, thus creating unlikely monuments from the podiatrists' livelihood. 20</page><page sequence="18">Figure 16 Siskind: The Terrors and Pleasures of Levitation, 1954.

Light Gallery, New York. j4 ,dA 22 __</page><page sequence="20">A more serious and sustained effort at using the human form occurred during trips to Rome in 1963 and 1967. There, Siskind photographed figures carved in relief on triumphal arches in Rome and on the tombs along the Via Appia Antica. While these photographs exhibit many of the same formal properties of the earlier pictures, they represent an important new resolution to the problem of using the figure to express timeless ideas. Unlike the wall pictures that only allude to a human presence, and the photographs of jumping boys or the person in Durango, Mexico, that show the human presence at a single instant of time, these Roman photographs show figures permanently trapped against their relief walls, figures whose appearance gives full evidence of the passage of time. By giving his images a historical reference of great dimension in time, Siskind has, in the Roman pictures, broadened the percep- tion of man's struggle to live in a world that is less than ideal. Efforts to impose oneself on the urban environment recorded in the wall pictures become, in the Roman pictures, a more general effort to resolve the dilemma of making an eternal statement from a temporal existence.22 Siskind's pictorial structure has continued to evolve in order to maintain a relationship between what is expressed and the means of its expression. In Roman photographs such as Rome: Appia Antica 7, 1963 (figure 18), he has opened the space, allowing a greater appearance of depth than in his earlier work. This new interest in representing the world more in terms of our general perception of phenomena signals a lessening of absolute dominance of the image by the photographer. In his recent photographs of trees (figure 19), Siskind has pursued the expressive possibilities of this new formal solution even further. His tree subjects, often anthropomorphic in appearance, are viewed in a perspectival space, but through a surface design created by shadows cast by branches not included in the image. As a result, although Siskind increased the depth of the image, he did not relinquish the pictorial tension of a strongly articulated surface previously gener- ated by the flattened space. He has merely altered the terms of that tension. This simple alteration, however, articulates a significant new position in Siskind's concept of the relation- ship among the photographer, his work, and his world. The photographer no longer appears to dominate the world of the picture because, for the first time, something physically outside of the picture has intruded its presence into the image. Further, much as the shadow designs are an autono- mous pattern through which the subject is viewed, Siskind seems to acknowledge, in these recent pictures, that an essential pattern of personal fate has informed all of his image-making activity. Finally, for the first time since the documentary photographs, the viewer is able to enter the work rather than confronting it as an isolated, autonomous object. The object quality of the photograph as a unique independent expression has not been lost because the viewer's entrance into the work is through the sensibility of Siskind's vision, which is again articulated by the act of passing through an imposed pattern of shadows to gain access to the world in the picture.23 Thus, all of the earlier pictorial dualities have here been resolved into a medita- tion on the interrelationship of fate and will. As in the best of Siskind's images, these works are a photographic experi- ence in which both the photographer and the viewer recognize a concise visual equivalent of a concept funda- mental to their respective lives. The pictures of the Kline series and the Martha's Vineyard trees represent concurrent resolutions of the conflicting concerns in Siskind's photography.24 Since start- ing anew in 1943 with the desire to express a personal realization of the principle of duality, Siskind's own evolu- tion has seen him move between various opposing posi- tions regarding subject matter and formal control. In a curious reversal, the early emphasis on people in the urban photographs has given way to a highly refined sense of abstraction that originated in the rural architecture and early Gloucester pictures, while the later work in the country has dealt with people and animate subject matter. The most recent Martha's Vineyard pictures also represent a new position on the role of the photographer in the interrelationship of art and nature. With these photographs, Siskind has investigated a stance between the total efface- ment of the photographer's efforts in documentary work, which stresses the identity of subject and image, and the emphatic accentuation of those efforts in abstract work, which allows only the most tenuous of connections be- tween the subject and its representation. With all the fluctuations in subject matter and formal qualities, the constant element in Siskind's long career has been the ability to make his subjects and their appearance in the photograph work together to give clear and emphatic articulation to his changing perceptions and ideas regard- ing his relationships with others, with his world, and with his art. 23</page><page sequence="21">N -PA ~~~~~. . , v # t ' .'-'I- - - .i' I 4w'' '* *- . 0 1 - -1, of.-.ot - .. .-, I t... ! .4. .:.

Aaron Siskind (born 1903) has been the subject of several monographs and a variety of other publications. The first monograph was Aaron Siskind Photographs (New York: Horizon Press, 1959) with an introduction by Harold Rosen- berg. TvWo others have followed: Aaron Siskind Photographer (Rochester: George Eastman House, 1965) with an introduc- tion by Nathan Lyons, essays by Thomas B. Hess and Henry Holmes Smith, and a statement by Aaron Siskind; and Places (New York: Light Gallery, 1976) with an essay by Thomas B. Hess. The general chronology for Siskind up to 1964 provided in Lyons's introduction to Aaron Siskind Photographer is considerably augmented for the years up to 1950 in Carl Chiarenza's "Form and Content in the Early Work of Aaron Siskind," Masachusetts Review, 19, no. 4 (Winter 1978), pp. 808-833, and republished in Jerome Liebling, ed., Photography: Current Perspectives (Rochester: Light Impressions Corporation, 1978), pp. 180-205.

In his insightful review of Aaron Siskind Photographer in Artforum, January 1966, pp. 58-59, Arthur Bardo noted that Siskind's move to the flat picture plane as a controlling element actually preceded such acceptance by the abstract expressionist painters with whom Siskind's work is usually and quite correctly associated. Bardo observed that the primacy of the picture plane is obvious to a photographer using a view camera, but it was Siskind's contribution to emphasize this aspect of photography "for its utility as providing the ideally neutral ground on which he could impose his vision" (p. 58). 15. Siskind in Lyons, Photographers on Photography, p. 97. 16. In a remarkable article, "Photography en abyme," Octo- 26</page><page sequence="24">ber, no. 5 (Summer 1978), Craig Owens demonstrated how a visible concern with the operations of photographic re- cording and duplication serves to signal the photographer's intent to make his work not a mere record of a scene but more a meditation on the possibilities of making pictures by photography. While Owens's article cited particularly the inclusion of mirrors in an image as signs of the photo- graph's own mirroring of reality, other formal and visual devices can be used to signal both the seriousness of the photographer and the context in which his efforts gain greatest meaning. The obvious intentionality of Siskind's imposition of a flat field and frame in his photographs indicates that the transformations occasioned in the re- cording process as directed by the photographer are sig- nificant elements in understanding the image. Further, Siskind's adoption of certain appearances of surrealism articulated his desire to have his photographs seen as serious statements in the context of a prevailing avant-garde movement. Another means of relating his work to that of Rothko, Gottlieb, and Newman (with all of whom he was becoming close friends in this critical 1943-45 period) was Siskind's move to making large-scale photographic prints. This marked a break with the prevailing American pho- tographic aesthetic of contact prints seen in the work of people like Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand, Edward Weston, and the early work of Ansel Adams. In his book review, Bardo, op. cit., saw the limitation of scale as the primary obstacle that Siskind had still to overcome before his photographs would be considered on an equal basis with abstract-expressionist painting. It is also worth remember- ing that influences worked both ways. Hess (Places, p. 6) noted that Siskind's work in 1943-45 precedes and in many ways predicts the paintings of Franz Kline in 1949/50. In addition, Hess recorded the importance to de Kooning of a Siskind photograph that the painter owned when he was working on Woman I. Although Hess (p. 7) saw primarily formal similarities in the two works, it is worth considering how Siskind's resolution of combining figuration and ab- straction would have interested de Kooning in his battle of several years to achieve in Woman I (1950-53) a new resolution of figurative and abstract elements in a single painting. 17. Aaron Siskind, "The Essential Photographic Act ...,"Art News, 54, no. 8, (December 1955), p. 36. 18. Henry Holmes Smith, Aaron Siskind Photographer, dis- cussed the connections between Siskind's work and the tradition of Stieglitz's equivalents. 19. Hess (Places, p. 10) cited three of Siskind's "recurrent typologies": the "conversations," "mother and child," and "trinities." Chiarenza in "Form and Content" deals at greater length on the special importance of the "conversation pieces" (as he terms them) in Siskind's work. 20. Chiarenza in "Photographs by Aaron Siskind in Homage to Franz Kline" discusses this fully. 21. Chiarenza, "Form and Content," p. 202, recorded Sis- kind's memory of his experience in 1943/44: "The thing that was driving me was a need for order. I felt so completely disturbed ... so many conflicting forces were working within me, that the pleasure I got from making a picture, and the thing that was driving me to make the picture, was that that was the only way I could organize, could get a sense of order and relaxation." 22. Since beginning his work with Roman statues, Siskind has also photographed Olmec stone heads in Mexico and ancient cut stone walls in Peru. 23. Siskind in Lyons, Photographers on Photography, p. 98, articulated his interest in producing objects to be con- fronted by the viewer: "When I make a photograph I want it to be an altogether new object, complete and self-con- tained, whose basic condition is order-(unlike the world of events and actions whose permanent condition is change and disorder)." 24. For Siskind, there is no definitive statement or direction in the total oeuvre. Holding to the "body of work" concept so important to the program at the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he taught for many years, each new set of photographs examines a different problem or approach. Working on one set of photographs does not preclude working on another simultaneously. Any problem or approach remains viable so long as it continues to yield interesting pictures. At present Siskind continues to photograph walls, homages to Franz Kline, and trees, as well as other subjects. In discussing particular evolutions in subject matter, this article has dealt with the most paradigmatic of Siskind's efforts, but inevitably has only hinted at the true variety and complexity of his complete work. 27</page></plain_text>
