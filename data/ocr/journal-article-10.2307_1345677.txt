<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Aphrodite with a Janus Face": Language, Desire, and History in Forster's The Longest Journey RAE H. STOLL I measure the world of fancies, seeking one like thee, And find--alas! mine own infirmity. Shelley, Epipsychidion In June 1964, when he was eighty-five, E. M. Forster went to visit William Golding in Wiltshire. There they walked the chalky soil of a pagan entrench- ment, the Figsbury Rings, and talked of the possible extinction of Chalk Blue butterflies by the use of pesticides in the area. Sixty years before, Forster's first encounter with the Rings had released and connected for him a number of deeply felt desires. They had also provided him with a symbolic center around which to cluster these longings in the most autobiographical of his novels, and his favorite among them: The Longest Journey (1907). Despite the reminder the butterflies provided of the now commonplace destruction of the pastoral English world which Forster had celebrated in his novels, the Rings confirmed his belief that in creating the flawed character Stephen Wonham, he had nevertheless given to the world from which he had taken inspiration a fictional character whom he could think of as a living child.' After his day on the Rings with Golding, Forster wrote in his diary, recalling that at the end of The Longest Journey Stephen's young daughter sleeps with her father on a Wiltshire hillside in view of the Rings: I exclaimed several times that the area was marvellous, and large-larger than I recalled. I was filled with thankfulness and security and glad that I had given myself so much back. The butterfly was a moving glint, and I shall lie in Ste- phen's arms instead of his child. (Furbank 2:319) In hoping to insert himself into the space filled by the child of his own cre- ation, Forster revives the central fantasy which motivated his book and is re- flected in its character relationships as in an array of mirrors: the fantasy of reproduction achieved through the identification and completion of one's self in another. This fantasm or underlying master narrative, as Fredric Jameson calls it (Political Unconscious, 180), seeks, in the production of the text, a sym- bolic representation or realization of desire. Rereading The Longest Journey with insights provided by Freud's speculation on the dynamics of homosexuality, 1 In a note partly reproduced in his Introduction to the World's Classics edition of Tire Longyest Journey, Forster wrote: "Although so vague and stagey, [Stephen] is the only character who exists for me outside his book.... I received, I cre- ated, I restored" (Furbank 1:149).</page><page sequence="2">238 NOVEL I SPRING 1987 Lacan's inquiry into the linguistic-social nature of the constitution of the sub- ject, and Jameson's discussion of the political unconscious opens up this text as a psychologically and socially acute portrait of the artist. Such a reading discloses secrets buried in the language of the text and helps to put into perspective the radical decenteredness of its main character, Rickie Elliot, whose lack of a central unity and coherence has long been attrib- uted to Forster's failure to maintain sufficient control over his materials.2 Fol- lowing Lacan, I suggest that this complaint is based on a false assumption: that of the essential unity of the individual. What Forster presents in the character of Rickie is, in fact, much closer to Lacan's dispersed or disunified individual whose supposed identity is fraudulently constituted in the sym- bolic order. It is illusory to assume that a truly unified subject arises out of what is, in fact, a system of differences in which the identity of a member of one "sex" derives from his arbitrary, symbolic (phallic) opposition to the Other, whose own identity is a product, first, of her phallic lack and, in con- sequence, of her exclusion from the forms of power, including discourse, as- sumed by the possessor of the phallus--the differentiating marker. The pri- mary role of this possessor is father in the nuclear family-the social place (not, of course, necessarily the individual family) in which children are social- ized and sexed-largely through being admitted to the symbology of lan- guage. Luce Irigaray explains the male "identity-claiming assumption" as a statement that "I am a unified, coherent being, and what is significant in the world reflects my male image" (Jones, 364). In exploring Rickie's attempts and failures to locate what is frequently re- ferred to in the novel as the "real," and thus to gain a stable identity, the text itself implies the need for precisely this questioning of phallocentric dis- course. With the aid of Jameson's dialectical use of the semiotics of Greimas, I shall trace several ideological reasons provided in the text for why it cannot fully engage or resolve the questions it raises. I. Language and Desire The Figsbury Rings, an Iron Age earthworks, are as Forster describes them in The Longest Journey, where they are renamed the Cadbury Rings: two concen- tric embankments of grass with crops growing in between and a small tree in the center. Forster first visited the site in September 1904, when he met there a shepherd boy with a club foot. Like other features of this visit which are dispersed throughout the narrative of The Longest Journey, the club foot as- 2 Lionel Trilling (1943) found The Longest Journey admirable but substantively confused, a boiler almost blown apart by the pressure of its own emotional steam. Others have complained of its philosophical and aesthetic disunity: John Harvey (1956) locates the problem in the inadequate view of life set forth in the novel; Frederick Crews (1962) attributes the novel's confusion to formal disjunctions; Wilfred Stone (1966) remarks on Forster's inability to find an integrated identity for his central character--an assessment with which I agree, while differing with Stone's evaluation of the reasons for and implica- tions of this inability. K. W. Gransden (1962) and F. P. W. McDowell (1960-61) uphold the integrity of the text by divorcing Forster from his ego character. Robert Martin (1982) finds the problem, after all, to have been a mistaken one; he regards Forster as having used Rickie and Stephen as a Paterian "sacred male couple" who together create in Stephen the "integrated self" Forster was seeking (109). Each of these approaches is based on an assumption about the proper and es- sential unity of the individual which I argue the text undermines.</page><page sequence="3">RAE H. STOLL FORSTER'S LONGINGS 239 sumes a central, symbolic role in the novel. It is transferred to Rickie Elliott, in whom it figures as a genetic disqualification and as an emblem of his true homosexual nature. In contrast to the enclosed Madingley dell near Cam- bridge, where Rickie brings only the most intimate friends from his small cir- cle at the university, the expansive Rings in the Wiltshire countryside are the resting place of common soldiers and farmers, who died in defending their homes. The desire Forster expressed to lie in Stephen's arms in the Rings, as in blissful, self-fulfilled death, recalls the story of these ancient men who are said in the novel to lie together in common burial. They are connected with Rickie's desire for democratic brotherhood, his need to unite his social self with what Stuart Hampshire calls the proletarian, sexual self of the uncon- scious. The Rings are at the heart of the novel, and at their heart a single small tree-alternately identified with Rickie's mother and his brother, Ste- phen-who represent the principles of generation and continuity, from which Rickie is excluded. An early outline for The Longest Journey, dated 17 July 1904, suggests the ef- fect Forster's first visit to the Rings had on the evolution of his novel.3 The original plan was for a well-plotted novel which began in the highly recogni- zable world of Cambridge and then moved to the estate of an Englishman in Italy, where the young Cambridge graduate, Humphrey, would discover his "natural" brother, Pasquale. Besides these somewhat improbably named brothers, the outline also projects disrupters in Humphrey's life: "a 'brainy, uncouth' friend who 'ran' him at Cambridge and a pushy wife who would also try to run him." The novel was to end in death by fire for both broth- ers-a scheme suggesting Forster's plans to borrow heavily from Wagner, as well as from Shelley, whose anti-monogamist lines in the Epipsychidion give the novel its title.4 Of the two "influences," Shelley's is the greater. The narrative structure of the novel essentially follows that of Shelley's autobiographical poem: each work recounts the history of the writer's spiritual quest and romantic life, and near the close of each the hero-speaker seems to achieve the central fantasy of the text-union with and dissolution into a fantastical self-image, the epi- psychidion, or "soul out of my soul" (238). Shelley's speaker expresses what Forster was looking for in the original ending he had projected for his novel: "One hope within two wills, one will beneath / Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death, / One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality, / And one an- nihilation" (584-87). Then, as though a Reality Principle had stepped in to cut off the fantasy at its most insupportable, the self is rudely severed from the ideal self, and each text comes to an abrupt end. The speaker of the poem ac- knowledges the inadequacy of his language to retrieve the lost object: "The winged words on which my soul would pierce / Into the height of Love's rare 3 Forster's plot outline is reproduced in Furbank 1:118. 4 The lines Rickie reads from Shelley, rejecting the notion that he should "With one sad friend, perhaps a jealous foe, / The dreariest and the longest journey go," appear on pp. 126-27 of the Abinger edition. For discussions of the uses of Wagner in Forster's text, see Tony Brown and Elizabeth Heine, Editor's Introduction to the Abinger edition of The Longest Journey, pp. x-xv.</page><page sequence="4">240 NOVEL SPRING 1987 Universe, / Are chains of lead around its flight of fire" (588-90). The object the poet seeks is Lacan's "real," exactly defined for our purposes by Terry Ea- gleton: "that inaccessible realm ... always beyond the reach of signification" (168). The words of Shelley's speaker have meaning only by virtue of the ab- sence of the ideal Other whom he is seeking; entering language, he has taken on both separation and desire. By definition, the ideal self he desires exists only in opposition to an earthbound, unheroic self, from whom it is unaltera- bly separated. The two selves cannot be rejoined by the same instrument that was the cause of their division, language. Ultimately, the speaker is himself dissolved into an excess of Romantic language, by which he, too, has been constituted: "I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire!" (591). The writer the novel portrays experiences a similar failure in attempting to regain the lost Other by means of symbolization. In addition, the conclusion of The Longest Journey ap- propriates much of the narrative apparatus of the last few lines of Shelley's poem--consigning only Rickie to destruction and, through the image of a flaming rose afloat in a stream, signaling Stephen's continuation. The projected Gotterdammerung of Forster's outline was too fantastical a clo- sure, too close to the level of pure wish fulfillment, to survive the conflicts the text produces in reworking and elaborating the desires generated by For- ster's confrontation with the Rings, the lame boy, and the idea of a future with a different social order. In fact, those passages in the completed novel which attempt to make Stephen "heroic" by giving him a Siegfried-like char- acter (in one version he was named Harold) are the least convincing. As is shown by the manuscript changes appended to the Abinger edition of the novel, Forster excised much of this material, including a whole chapter de- picting "Harold" wandering naked in a forest. The original, abandoned clo- sure in both the Shelley poem and the Forster novel was a kind of pure fan- tasy which the undeniable contradiction of experience, or history, made insupportable. In the case of Maurice, Forster unfortunately stuck with such fantasy in the teeth of history, and produced a much less moving and much less important book. The Longest Journey reworks fantasy in the direction of greater faithfulness to a complex and contradictory situation, at once social and psychological. The narrative connecting Rickie to Stephen is a complex exploration of the basis of Rickie's desire for such a brother, of his adoration, envy, and near-masochistic need to sacrifice himself for Stephen, and of the roots of these needs in Rickie's desire for social and sexual inclusion and in his complicated love for his mother, who is referred to in the novel only as Mrs. Elliot. While much of the original plan of the novel remains intact, the triangle of protagonist, mother, and natural brother becomes the emotional core of the novel. The major deviation from the original plan, the continuation of Ste- phen, involves a psychological transaction: the brother and friend Rickie de- sires becomes the self Rickie would have to be in order to possess the things he wants most: a place in the continuous stream of life, male camaraderie, and the instinctive impulse to social action.</page><page sequence="5">RAE H. STOLL I FORSTER'S LONGINGS 241 Rickie, who believes "that one can like many more people than one sup- poses" (20), leans toward the position of his socialist uncle, Mr. Failing, who "believed that things could be kept together by accenting the similarities, not the differences of men" (98). Opposing him in this desire for brotherhood is Stewart Ansell, the brainy friend, who defends his right to hate members of the "beefy" set and who refuses even to admit the existence of someone as remote to his life and as threatening to his interests as is Agnes Pembroke. Ansell's denial of "reality" to Agnes in the opening scene of the novel when he refuses to shake her hand or to acknowledge her claims on Rickie as his guest, or in any other capacity, reflects the social reality of Cambridge mis- ogyny at the time in which the book is set. Ansell also does to Agnes what the world outside seemed to be doing to intellectual male Cambridge: denying it significance as a creative and influential force.5 As a social out- sider, but primarily as a sexual intruder, Agnes is denied both human form and potential human merit by Ansell. His attitude toward her resembles that of Clive and Maurice, the Cambridge friends and platonic lovers in the novel Maurice who regard the women in their families as members of a sub-species. Because Ansell reenters Rickie's life as his liberator, urging him to recognize his brother and to dissolve his marriage to Agnes, while, in the words of Shelley's Epipsychidion, she becomes a "jealous foe" (158), the motivating im- pulse toward social unity in the text becomes diffused. In its animus toward Agnes, the text appears to advance both Ansell's mis- ogyny and his contempt for Rickie's democratic feelings. The Agnes-Rickie- Ansell plot works against the values of union and inclusiveness associated with Rickie, his mother, and Stephen--values expressed by Mr. Failing and Stephen's father, Robert, as opposed to Ansell. To a large extent, however, the masculine hauteur and the Shelleyan sentiments associated with Ansell are red herrings. Ansell is not simply an adherent of open and free relation- ships, as his opposition to Rickie's marriage seems intended to imply. He is also a "jealous foe." He, as well as Agnes, wishes to enter into an exclusive contract with Rickie, as does Rickie with him. Rickie's notion that their friend- ship, which the text compares to that of David and Jonathan, should be "labelled," that their "marriage of true minds" should be recorded in "a kind of friendship office," draws approval from Ansell (64). In fact, Rickie's desire for friendship with Ansell is voiced in the language of Shakespeare's Sonnet 116, which argues for constancy in love. Ansell's pseudo-Shavian claim that "a man wants to love mankind; woman wants to love one man" (272) is con- tradicted both by his own desire to be joined by contract to Rickie and by his confession that he is "bored by the prospect of the brotherhood of man" (207). Although Ansell's attitudes toward Agnes and marriage tend to obscure the connection, the "Agnes" plot is linked to the "Mrs. Elliot" plot in ways that help to explain the antinomies of the text. These connections are 5 See Rita McWilliams-Tullberg on the indictment of Cambridge by the press at the turn of the century, when its refusal to admit women as university degree candidates opened it to charges of ingrownness and social isolation. A typical criticism, in the Lincolnshire Echo, remarked on "the spectacle of a powerful University forgetting its logic in a fit of prejudice, self- ishness and timidity" (132).</page><page sequence="6">242 NOVEL SPRING 1987 involved in Rickie's constitution as a "subject"-most especially in his symbi- otic relationship to Stephen. In the opening chapters of the novel, Rickie's beautiful mother, who died when he was fifteen, has been replaced by Cambridge. Since her death, Rickie has been bullied and frozen into an imitation schoolboy by a public school, but at Cambridge he regains a sense of his own reality: "She had taken and soothed him, and warmed him, and had laughed at him a little, saying he must not be so tragic yet awhile, for his boyhood had been but a dusty corridor that led to the spacious halls of youth" (5-6). In "the spacious halls of youth" an extended adolescence and, for some, a sexual quiescence are possible. There young men, instead of maturing and marrying in order to reproduce themselves, are simply replaced by other young men in most re- spects duplicates of themselves. They are a somewhat larger version of the boys under the supervision of Mr. Read, Principal of Maurice's public school, to whom "they seemed ... a race small but complete, like the New Guinea pygmies, 'my boys'. And they were even easier to understand than pygmies, because they never married and seldom died. Celibate and immortal, the long procession passed before him" (Maurice, 10). Celibate, or at least unmarried, and immortal: this, the Agnes-Ansell plot of the novel suggests, would be the ideal state for Rickie. For Rickie, Cambridge prolongs adolescence and fosters dependency even as, to use Lacan's term, it provides him with a renewed sense of himself in admitting him to the "symbolic order" of masculine society. The "imaginary" or mirror phase of Rickie's infancy and young childhood, when his father was usually absent, retains an exceptional hold on his emotions and his conscious memory. Bodied forth from the mirror of his mother whose presence encircled him, he experienced a completeness of identity; there was no gap between himself as subject and the great world, such as opened up at public school. At school, the naturalness and wholeness of a taken-for-granted iden- tity are dispersed by a system of fixed social and sexual roles. To survive in this unreal world, he fabricates a persona modeled on images he forms of the boys around him. Ordinarily, the painful passage of the young boy from the imaginary to the symbolic order is achieved by resolution of the Oedipal complex. To have identity in this new order, he must accept the absence of his mother's mirror- ing presence. Then the gap between signifier and signified opens up for him, and he is cut off from the "real," which eludes any signifying system. Desire for the real-that is, desire to recapture the object which bestows wholeness and gives significance to all other objects-cannot be satisfied; nevertheless, it remains a driving force in individual life. As Eagleton writes in an explanation of Lacan's theory that might well be a gloss on this novel: "an original lost object-the mother's body- ... drives forward the narrative of our lives, impelling us to pursue substitutes for this lost paradise in the end- less metonymic movement of desire" (185).</page><page sequence="7">RAE H. STOLL I FORSTER'S LONGINGS 243 In his rooms at Cambridge, which he loves "better than any person," Rickie feels "almost as safe as he felt once when his mother killed a ghost in the passage by carrying him through it in her arms" (58, 59). The ghost in the "dark passage" (23), suggesting Ibsen's play, is Rickie's father, who is associ- ated with Rickie's sexual fears and with his sexual infirmity. Largely as a re- sult of his father's indifference, Rickie has failed to negotiate the Oedipal pas- sage. His identity is still tied to the body of his mother, in whose arms he finds shelter from the threatening and divisive world of school and society. After his return to Cambridge from a visit to Agnes Pembroke and her brother, Herbert, at Sawston school, Rickie is "like one who had escaped from danger" (59). "There was no ghost now; he was frightened at reality; he was frightened at the splendours and horrors of the world" (59). His rooms are haven against the love and death he has witnessed, just as his mother's arms were security against his childhood ghosts. Back in his rooms, figura- tively back with his mother, he is safe again from the threat of sex. But, be- cause of his experience outside the university, he has learned to define "reality" differently from Ansell, who associates it with an exclusivist "salvation" of an elite group at the academy-in Plato's words, "the saving remnant." In fact, back at Cambridge, Rickie begins to worry that the univer- sity will itself come to seem to him narrow and that Ansell is incapable of re- sponding to the real "splendours and horrors" of the world: "Ansell could discuss love and death admirably, but somehow he would not understand lovers or a dying man.... Would Cambridge understand them either?" (57). The movement of desire impels Rickie beyond Cambridge. He had been initiated into other realities when he saw Agnes and Gerald embracing and when, a few days later, Gerald was killed in a football acci- dent. Gerald, Rickie's old nemesis from public school to whom he remains tied by ambivalent feelings of attraction and repulsion, is the means by which Rickie is drawn to Agnes: he falls in love with Gerald's love for her. Gerald, in fact, shows untypical insight in recognizing that Rickie's motivation for of- fering him and Agnes money to marry on is somehow furtively bound up with Rickie's desire to become part of their union: "Marry us," Gerald ex- plodes to Agnes, "he, you, and me-a hundred pounds down and as much annual-he, of course, to pry into all we did, and we to kowtow and eat dirt- pie to him" (49). Rickie's Cambridge-inspired Hellenism reinforces his attraction to Gerald, whose "figure" he regards as that "of a Greek athlete" (35). The objective cor- relative of this attraction is the bust of Hermes of Praxiteles, patron of ath- letes, which stands in the Pembrokes' hall and which will reenter the story when the dead Gerald reappears to Agnes and Rickie in the form of another man. For now, the text merely establishes a bond between the Greek-like bully, Gerald, and his former victim, Rickie: "Between Rickie and Gerald there lay a shadow that darkens life more often than we suppose. The bully and his victim never quite forget their first relations" (38). For Rickie this shadow is a kind of masochistic attraction to brutality and a need for self-</page><page sequence="8">244 NOVEL I SPRING 1987 abnegation. The masochistic element in Rickie's love for Gerald/Agnes is most evident at the moment Rickie and Agnes agree to marry: "Never forget that your greatest thing is over," he reminds her. "What he gave you then is greater than anything you will get from me" (74). Rickie marries Agnes as a poor substitute for the man he insists on her thinking of as her real bride- groom, for only with thought of Gerald's continuing presence in their mar- riage can Rickie be a husband to Agnes. When Stephen breaks the bust of Hermes which stands in the hall of Sawston school, he destroys this relation- ship between Rickie, his wife, and her dead lover. At that time, Stephen, whom Agnes momentarily confuses with Gerald, replaces Gerald in Rickie's emotional life and destroys the marriage between Rickie and Agnes. Gerald has prepared for Stephen in another way, too: the self-loathing which charac- terizes Rickie's relationship with Gerald/Agnes anticipates his eventual mutila- tion and self-sacrifice for Stephen's sake. In the dell outside Madingley, Rickie's holy place at Cambridge, he is to- tally safe. The dell is a magical circle which both contains and enlarges; there Rickie reenters the imaginary order in which objects are seamlessly reflected in one another: "The place looked as big as Switzerland or Norway-as indeed for the moment it was-and he came upon it at a time when his life too was beginning to expand. Accordingly the dell became for him a kind of church-a church where indeed you could do anything you liked, but where anything you did would be transfigured" (18). The transfiguring effect of the dell is the result of Rickie's own creative imagination. Its impression of size is merely one of reflection: the sky and the surrounding trees are mirrored, and thus multiplied, in the "fiords and lagoons of clearest water" (18) left behind by the melted January snows. This is a place of magnification and mirrors, of transformations, which, during a January thaw, expands to the size of Nor- way, replete with fiords. It is the true home of Rickie-and of Forster, whose birth month was January. The winter child who realizes his desires only indi- rectly, through surrogates, especially those of the imagination, creates for himself a version of the northern world to which "the woman he loved" (282), his mother, escaped with her lover. In the dell he dreams of what his brother-the child born in April, the child of Demeter-has so abundantly: the power through his own fecundity to make their mother live again. Ste- phen has the ability to realize the dreams which Rickie fulfills only in the imaginative act, in art. It is also in exclusive claim to this dell that an under- graduate aesthete remarks when he first enters it: "Procul este, profani!" (Un- sanctified commoners, keep out!) (18). The dell is both a social and a sexual retreat: it offers privileged protection to infantile desires and to a small coterie of friends. It is, at the same time, a powerfully evocative representation of the realm of the Imaginary itself. The next passage Rickie attempts, his "going down" from Cambridge into the venal world of Sawston is, on the one hand, a necessary step toward out- growing his infantile attachment to his mother and alma mater. Rickie's mar- riage is a test of his adulthood and fitness to be a parent, on which account</page><page sequence="9">RAE H. STOLL FORSTER'S LONGINGS 245 he is extremely anxious. On the other hand, it is a journey into a life of fur- ther division and unreality, in which differences-especially differences in sex and class-figure even more prominently. Sawston is the home of the refur- bished, fake public school and training ground for the new class of techno- crats and managers who are a threat to any kind of authenticity the text can imagine. Because his defection to Sawston (and Agnes) is also a betrayal of his mother, to whom the image-releasing dell is consecrated, Rickie's fall from sexual innocence cuts him off from the source of his creativity. His guilt-rid- den attraction to Agnes, by whom he is finally "entrapped" in the dell, dram- atizes Freud's theory that the homosexual man is attracted to women, but that he transfers the "stimulus ... received from the woman to a male object ... [thus repeating] again and again the mechanism through which he ac- quired his homosexuality."6 "By repressing the love for his mother," Freud explains, "he conserves the same in his unconscious and henceforth remains faithful to her. When as a lover he seems to pursue boys, he really thus runs away from women who could cause him to become faithless to his mother" (66). When Agnes calls to Rickie from within the dell, where he has declined to follow her, he drives his fingers into his ears, invoking the name of Ger- aid. Finally responding to her call, he enters but whispers to her: "I prayed you might not be a woman" (73). Rickie, in fact, alternately pursues male and female substitutes for the original object he wishes to repossess. In a series of abortive attempts to satisfy desire, he moves from his mother to Gerald to Cambridge and Ansell (the safe alter mater and platonic friend) to Agnes and, finally, to Stephen Wonham, who is so intimately linked with both Rickie's ideal self and his mother that the three are conflated at one point in a single Janus-faced image.7 In a fine example of intertextual play, Rickie, like Shelley's speaker, at- tempts to regain an ideal love, to find, in a series of replacements, the "Being" whom the poet recalls from "the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn" (190, 191). For the affective center of The Longest Journey, however, 6 The novel does not, of course, "endorse" Freud's theories concerning the origins of homosexuality. In fact, it leans toward the theory Havelock Ellis set forth in Sexual Inversion (1897) that homosexuality may be inborn and inherited. What the text offers is a psychosexual (and sociosexual) dynamics compatible with that explored by Freud and present as well in the pro- creation sonnets. Elizabeth Heine considers when and what Forster knew about actual Freudian theory regarding homosex- uality (Editor's Introduction to the Abinger The Longest Journey, pp. xviii-xxvi). I would add to her remarks that awareness of Freudian theory was a possibility for him-via Ellis and G. L. Dickinson-before 1910, and I would certainly agree with her that Forster, like Freud, was enough of a symbolist consciously, as well as unconsciously, to have "intended" what we would call the Freudian implications of many of his symbols and of the traits and relationships of his characters. 7 In this respect the anagrammatic suggestiveness of Stephen's surname is striking. "Wonham" yields the word "woman," and it is phonetically close to "womb." These connections are consistent with other, recurrent impulses in Forster's fiction. Repeatedly in the fiction a central figure who is him (or her) self "sterile" becomes a parent through a surrogate self, and the union that actually produces the child often violates sociosexual taboos which are considered in the world Forster writes about to be essential to the natural order of things. The great desire for progeny and the simultaneous identification with and resentment of women which these unorthodox unions and births reflect become disturbingly explicit in "Little Imber," the last short story Forster wrote-in 1961, less than three years before he returned to the Rings, when he was al- most eighty-three. The two central characters-the elderly, cultivated Warham (a reworking of Wonham, and an indication of the interchangeability of Forster's alter egos?), and a rough, virile, young man named Imber-meet during their mission- ary travels for a country in which the male birthrate has been drastically declining. Instead of impregnating the women of the colony they visit, as intended, they join their seed and produce not just one child, but the beginning of a whole new race of "Romuloids and Remoids," each of whom desires his "own younger brother" (Artic Sumrmer, 235). When finally the male and female birthrate figures are reversed, there is rejoicing because, in the last words of the story, "Males had won" (235).</page><page sequence="10">246 NOVEL SPRING 1987 Forster drew not only on Shelley's Epipsychidion, but, more profoundly, on the poems of another writer who shared his feelings about continuity and who took as seriously as he the Biblical injunction: "Be fruitful and multiply." The language in which Forster explores the nature of the relationship of Rickie, Stephen, and their mother-that is, the nature of Rickie's sexuality and of his constitution as a subject-is drawn not from the publicly acknowl- edged lines of Shelley which appear in the text, but from Shakespeare's Son- nets 1 to 17, the "procreation sonnets."8 C. L. Barber calls attention to the re- semblance of a pattern in the procreation sonnets to one which Freud found in his study of an infantile reminiscence of Leonardo da Vinci. This pattern is also clearly present in The Longest Journey. In each case--of the artist and sub- ject of psychoanalytical speculation, of the poet-speaker of the sonnets, and of the hero of the novel-the central character in the drama preserves "his re- lationship to a maternal presence by internalizing her cherishing of him, be- coming like her in narcissistically cherishing [a] young man" (Barber, 35). In a description that anticipates Lacan's placing of Desire at the heart of the con- stitution of the subject, Freud writes that the boy represses the love for the mother by putting himself in her place, by iden- tifying himself with her, and by taking his own person as a model through the similarity of which he is guided in the selection of his love object. He thus be- comes homosexual; as a matter of fact he returns to the stage of autoeroticism, for the boys whom the growing adult now loves are only substitute persons or revivals of his own childish person, whom he loves in the same way his mother loved him. (65) The brothers Rickie and Stephen, each of whom fills the role of cherishing parent for the other, are particularly suited to dramatize the way in which the lover narcissistically reenacts the role of the mother in his attachment to his beloved. As Jane Pinchin has perceptively observed of Forster's fiction: "Images of comrades and siblings gave him the necessary fictive mask through which he could deal with homosexuality, and often allowed him to dig to the roots of sexuality in familial and friendship relationships" (95). In Rickie's love for Stephen, as in Shakespeare's love for the fair young man, the idea of generation and continuation is twined with the idea of recip- rocal nurturing between lovers and of the reflection of one in the other, just as child and parent are reflected in one another. The child experiences itself through discovering itself reflected in the parent; so, too, the lovers. Sonnets 1 and 3 in particular provide the language and the symbols through which the significance of the relationship between Rickie and Stephen is conveyed. 8 In the diary entry which contains Forster's retrospective on 1907, the year The Longest Journey was completed, he includes a reading list largely composed of writers on homoerotic subjects. Among them were Whitman, Pater, Symonds, Housman, Edward Carpenter, Samuel Butler, Edward Fitzgerald, and Shakespeare (Furbank I:159n.).</page><page sequence="11">RAE H.

After the death of his child, whose deformity is worse than his own, Rickie turns obsessively to Stephen, whom he had rejected just before his marriage to Agnes. Before his reunion with his brother, however, Rickie has a vision of their dead mother crying in his room: "He whispered, 'Never mind, my dar- ling, never mind,' and a voice echoed 'Never mind--come away-let them die out-let them die out'" (193). Rickie comes to love Stephen as the means through which "she whom he loved had risen from the dead" (250- 51). The Elliot line will end with the death of Rickie who already thinks of himself as "dead" because he cannot "contribute to the stream" (192). Rickie shares, but cannot realize, the desire of Gino Carella in Where Angels Fear to Tread to "have sons like him, to people the earth" (109). "The strongest desire that can come to a man," Forster writes in this earlier novel, is "that physical and spir- itual life may stream out of him for ever" (109).</page><page sequence="12">248 NOVEL SPRING 1987 In contrast to Rickie, Stephen, fair child of the spring, is identified with re- newal and resurrection: "Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee / Calls back the lovely April of her prime."9 Stephen is born in April, a birth month to which the text calls specific attention. During his parents' scant two weeks together in July, Stephen is conceived. "I am twenty-two in April," he writes to a child at Sawston (187). Through Stephen and his progeny, "beauty's rose," the youthful perfection of the mother of Rickie's infancy, will never die. Stephen becomes for Rickie what the young man is to Shakespeare: "the world's fresh ornament / And only herald to the gaudy spring." In the case of Stephen, however, the young man is herald not only to a single season or generation, but to a new race, a new social order. Stephen--who is born of a misalliance between a gentlewoman and an educated farmer and whose most distinguishing mark is his classlessness--survives as a prophetic harbinger of a new order of men who will "inherit" England. Such men, it is vaguely im- plied, will heal social divisions and realize the lively promise of an older, pas- toral England, turning out the gray technocrats, managers, and monopo- lists--the new controlling class whose disruption of the national life Rickie experiences as a member of the disappearing rentier class. The sexual compo- nent of this desire for social restoration and reunion, both inseparable from and homologous to it, is the relationship between Rickie and Stephen and their mother. At the Cambridge dell and in his college rooms, Rickie's mother is his alone; he speaks of her to his friends, but withholds his most intimate and painful memories of her. Her role expands in the countryside of Wiltshire on the Rings--or the "mystic circles" (255), as the narrator calls them, thus con- necting them with the "mystic rose" (278) which represents her as the mother of Stephen. As the mother of both Rickie and Stephen, she is the past, the earth, and Demeter, who is connected with death as well as with fertility. Through Stephen, her natural child and Rickie's fantasy brother, she reclaims Rickie from Agnes. As Stephen calls Rickie away from Sawston, he uses words similar to their mother's, speaking in her voice: "Come, I do mean it. Come; I will take care of you, I can manage you" (257). It was through the birth of the fair Stephen that she learned to love Rickie, the child his aunt called "the ugly little boy" (242). With Stephen's birth, "a curious thing happened. Her second child drew her towards her first. She be- gan to love Rickie also" (239). Stephen possesses those qualities required to make Rickie lovable. He is not only Rickie's anti-self, differing from him in 9 Cf. the lines from the Epipsychidion which use a similar set of associations to recall the poet's progenitor and ideal self: A Metaphor of Spring and Youth and Morning; A Vision like incarnate April, warning, With smiles and tears, Frost the Anatomy Into his summer grave. (120-23) That much of Shelley's and Forster's language may have shared a common source (an intertextual fact in which Forster, who loved to keep secrets from his readers, would have delighted) is tantalizingly suggested by a rejected passage from the manuscript of Epipsychidion, in which Shelley wrote: If any should be curious to discover Whether to you I am a friend or lover, Let them read Shakespeare's sonnets, taking thence A whetstone for their dull intelligence. (Selected Poems II. 34-37, 257).</page><page sequence="13">RAE H. STOLL I FORSTER'S LONGINGS 249 "disposition" and in fairness of form, but Rickie's completed self. Wilfred Stone's remarks about a narcissistic pattern in Forster's short story "Dr. Wool- acott" are pertinent here: "narcissism is not really love of the self, but love of one's self-image, a quite different thing. Clesant's desire to feel 'attractive' led him to project a self-image and a lover of that image which were nothing but the measure of his self-contempt. Love of one's image is a way of keeping the self at a distance, as something alien, even as something odious" ("Overleaping Class," 401-02). Like the ghost of a farm worker whose deathly embrace "rescues" the invalid Clesant in the short story, Stephen is a splitting off of a self-image from Rickie, whose repeated failures to gain a stable mas- culine identity thwart his desire to be what his mother desires. That, the text makes clear, is the robust and inarticulate self-image, Stephen, not the clever weak boy, Rickie. In the early thirties Forster gave a paper on memory to the Bloomsbury Memoir Club which related how the owners had turned his mother and him- self out of "Rooksnest," their beloved home in Herfordshire and the model for "Howards End," where he lived until he was fourteen. He concluded his recollection with a remarkable statement: "If I had been allowed to stop on there I should have become a different person, married, and fought in the war" (Colmer, 3). To whatever extent Forster believed his sexual tempera- ment and his pacific nature would have been altered by continuing to live in the English countryside, where traditional life strongly favored marriage and continuity, he associated being cut off from the land with being deprived of home and of heirs. There is regret over both of these deprivations in all of his novels. Through Rickie, Forster appears to extend the internalized love of his mother to an idealized adult version of the undeveloped, cut-off child in him- self, the one who, under other circumstances, would have grown up "whole" in Wiltshire, or at Rooksnest: Stephen. As if desire were seeking to express itself in a symbolic form as far removed from articulate, divisive discourse as possible, the text of The Longest Journey both conceals and discloses its affective center in imagery borrowed from the procreation sonnets. Similarly, it uses a metonymic chain of visual images of stream and river and flowers to indicate the shift in values which takes place as Rickie moves from classbound Cambridge toward a more inclu- sive identity. Through this use of language as "symbolic action," the concepts of "good" and "real" which have been restricted in the text to association with an elite sensibility are replaced by a more inclusive definition, at once sexual and social. After Rickie's discovery of his mother's adultery, he "journeyed ... till he stood behind right and wrong. On the banks of the gray torrent of life, love is the only flower. A little way up the stream and a little way down had Rickie glanced, and he knew that she whom he loved had risen from the dead, and might rise again" (250-51). The stream and flower imagery which links Rickie's mother with "love ... the only flower" and with the generational life of the "eternal stream" is re- peated in a memorable passage which expands beyond its context. On their</page><page sequence="14">250 NOVEL I SPRING 1987 last evening together Stephen shows Rickie a trick with a crumpled ball of pa- per while they wade near the twin arches of a bridge fording a stream in Cadover: The paper caught fire from the match, and spread into a rose of flame. "Now gently with me," said Stephen, and they laid it flower-like on the stream. Gravel and tremulous weeds leapt into sight, and then the flower sailed into deep water, and up leapt the two arches of a bridge. "It'll strike!" they cried; "no, it won't; it's chosen the left," and one arch became a fairy tunnel, dropping diamonds. Then it vanished for Rickie; but Stephen, who knelt in the water, declared that it was still afloat, far through the arch, burning as if it would burn forever. (272-73) Early in the novel Rickie's and Ansell's set associates "good" and "salvation" with Cambridge and the intimate society, with exclusive friendship and ideal- ized states of mind. "Not saved," the narrating voice explains, "was a phrase they applied just then to those whom they did not like or intimately know" (16). When Rickie is parting from Ansell at Cambridge, Ansell tries to explain to him the non-existence of the "great" world as a thing outside of and su- perior to the "good" society of Cambridge and its small circles. He argues that fools "confuse 'great,' which has no meaning whatever, with 'good,' which means salvation" (63). Ansell tells Rickie, who has placed a garland of flowers on his friend's hair: "Look at this great wreath: it'll be dead tomor- row. Look at that good flower: it'll come up again next year" (63). The wreath, which Ansell associates with death, especially the deadness of the "great" world of Sawston, is also a token of farewell from one "friend" to an- other, both of whom are "sterile" in the sense that they will not leave heirs behind. Another wreath appears in the novel near its end, placed by Agnes on the grave of her infant daughter-the child whose inherited deformity convinces Rickie he should father no more children. Flower imagery conveys the primary contrast in the novel between death/sterility and love/continuity. Through this imagery Forster also prepares the shift of meaning in the words "good" and "salvation" as they define reality and identity for Rickie. "Good," which Ansell compares to the perennial flower, also becomes associated with love, the "only flower" (250), and thereby with Rickie's mother and genera- tion. At the end of the novel, after Stephen has married and fathered a child "to whom he had given the name of their mother," we are told that in sacri- ficing his life for Stephen's, Rickie had "bequeathed him salvation" (289). "Salvation," a word which both the real Cambridge Apostles and Forster's fic- tional ones half-jokingly reserved for themselves, no longer signifies the intel- lectual and cultural elite. Good has come to signify love, especially parental love, and salvation a place in the eternal stream.10 10 The Longest Journey was poorly received at Cambridge, even among the Apostles, who shared G. E. Moore's belief that one might easily "imagine a civilised society existing" without "paternal affection" (Principia Ethica, 158).</page><page sequence="15">RAE H. STOLL I FORSTER'S LONGINGS 251 Before lighting the paper rose at the bridge, Stephen tells Rickie of his ex- pectations to marry: "I want to marry some one, and don't yet know who she is.... For it's something rather outside that makes one marry, if you follow me: not exactly oneself" (271-72). Stephen here sounds as much an agent of the Life Force as Ansell supposes Agnes to be, but Forster's reasons in this case are closer to Shakespeare's than to Shaw's. The golden reflection of the flaming rose on Stephen's face, where it illuminates his fair mustache, signals his manhood and virility, his "golden time," the time when "that face should form another." Intent on Stephen's "transfigured face," Rickie "believed that a new spirit dwelt there, expelling the crudities of youth. He saw steadier eyes, and the sign of manhood set like a bar of gold upon steadier lips" (272). Stephen is ready to marry, "That thereby beauty's rose might never die." Rickie's idealized love of Stephen is a reflection of his almost mystical love of his mother which, because he is never able to transfer it to another wo- man, preserves his mother in his subconscious as the young woman of his in- fancy, when she was without restraint or qualification his "Beloved" (249). The strangeness in the attitudes of poet and novelist toward the young men they image in their work becomes comprehensible, as Barber says, "when one recognizes resemblances to cherishing parental attitudes, and more deeply still, to childlike feelings of dependence" (34). The relationship of lover, par- ent, and beloved is mutually reflexive. As Shakespeare images the young man in his poem, he duplicates the process by which he urges him to make a new image of himself. Similarly, in creating and saving Stephen, Forster and Rickie gain surrogate selves who can father "copies" of their mother-and of themselves. "She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby / Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die" (Sonnet 11): this is a charge which Shake- speare and Forster take seriously. Poetry is conventionally perceived to be another means of giving birth, of making and preserving. "Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest / Now is the time that face should form another" (Sonnet 3). The child is the mirror of the parent, the poem the mirror of the lover. Poetry and procreation are the twin means of immortality Shakespeare offers the beloved in the son- nets. The poet/creator is a parent, poetry a reflexive kind of care-taking of one's love, and of one's self. Language is both separation from and symbolic surrogate for the lost reality. Sonnet 22, which comes after the procreation sonnets, advances the idea of the reflection of the lovers in one another and of their taking turns in the role of cherishing parent: "My glass shall not per- suade me I am old / So long as youth and thou are of one date," the poet writes. He reminds his love that they share a single heart, or life source, and that, in the care they take of one another, the youth of one guarantees that of the other: Oh, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary As I, not for myself, but for thee will, Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.</page><page sequence="16">252 NOVEL SPRING 1987 In the beloved, in whom the poet sees himself as well, the grown child calls back the young mother of his infancy with whom he longs to share his own youth. Sons and lovers wish to be contemporary not with the careworn mothers of their youth, but with the young women of their infancy. Given this absence which serves, nonetheless, as an irreplaceable presence for the young writer, it is not surprising that the missing person in The Long- est Journey, like the missing person in the procreation sonnets, is a woman to be mother of the young man's child. Stephen's wife, for whom he had wished because of an instinctive need to reproduce himself, is kept as far in the background as possible. She appears only as a disembodied voice from an upstairs window, accepting Stephen's practice of keeping her "in line" (251). Shakespeare asks about the woman who may become mother of the young man's child: "For where is she so fair whose uneared womb / Disdains the til- lage of thy husbandry?" (Sonnet 3). The agricultural imagery applies as well to Stephen, farmer and son of a farmer, for whom a wife will also have only instrumental value. Leslie Fiedler guessed that Shakespeare longed for a means of conception without heterosexual intercourse; such a longing is re- peatedly projected in Forster's writing (86). "He bent down reverently and saluted the child; to whom he had given the name of their mother" (289): this, the last sentence in the novel, casts Ste- phen and his daughter in the role of the Holy Family, with Stephen serving as both madonna and donor."11 In this capacity, Stephen is not the voice, but the silencer, of his wife and of Rickie's mother, neither of whom has a given name in the text. His mother's name, which the text does not speak, he gives to his daughter, who thereby becomes equally nameless. As Mary Daly has argued, the power to name is the power to exist humanly-in one's own right, rather than as a guarantor of another's truth, or reality (8). In this re- spect, Rickie is quite right in blaming himself for loving Stephen only because their mother lived again in him, for loving him not openly as a man, but as a fantasy supplanter of a woman, whose Otherness, as Lacan shows, serves to secure for a man his own self-knowledge.12 The subterfuge involved in this symbolic mediation, and the uneasiness it causes, explains the unreality of Stephen as an independent character and the punishment which is meted out to Rickie; it also points to the ambivalent attitude toward the Other of the fa- milial protonarrative which is split between the idealization of Rickie's mother and the misogyny directed at Agnes-the two Mrs. Elliots. In his raids on the sonnets, Forster takes possession of a symbolic language to probe the nature of a sexual psychology which, though shaped by the expectations and prohibitions of a particular familial-social-political situation, has roots in the source of all human sexuality. Like the poet's love for the fair young man, Forster's for Stephen involves an almost mystical rec- 11 Comparable scenes occur in Where Agnels Fear to Tread, with Caroline Abbott, Gino Carella, and his infant son-posed be- fore an Italian landscape-explicitly described as "Virgin and Child, with Donor" (112) and at the conclusion of Howards End, where Margaret and Helen Schlegel are seated in the middle of a hay-making field with Helen's son. In each scene, one of the child's natural parents is missing; and in the cases just cited he or she is replaced by a "truer" parent. 12 See "A Love Letter" in Feminine Sexuality, pp. 149-61, especially p. 156.</page><page sequence="17">RAE H. STOLL FORSTER'S LONGINGS 253 ollection of infantile joy which remains in the adult as a substratum of emo- tional satisfaction and ego development. In an act that might have pleased Roland Barthes, who finds a similar jouissance in the pleasure the text takes in itself, Forster buries one more allusion to the sonnets in his text-this time playfully and irreverently. One of the most prominent candidates for "Mr. W.H.," to whom the sonnets are dedicated, was William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke. In The Longest Journey the character who is brother to Agnes and "intimately connected" with Rickie's "fortunes" (144) is pedantic house master at Sawston, Herbert Pembroke. II. History As part of an extended flashback revealing how Stephen came to be born, Stephen's father admits his love for Mrs. Elliot to her brother-in-law, the so- cialist writer Tony Failing: "Have I quite followed you, sir, in that business of the brotherhood of man?" "How do you mean?" "I thought love was to bring it about." "Love of another man's wife? Sensual love? You have understood nothing- nothing." Then he was ashamed, and cried, "I understand nothing myself." For he remembered that sensual and spiritual are not easy words to use; that there are, perhaps, not two Aphrodites, but one Aphrodite with a Janus face. (233) The one Aphrodite of this novel is Mrs. Elliot, whose Janus faces are the twin faces of her sons-one representing the spiritual side of love, the other its sensual side. On another level, they stand, like Janus, for an ending and a new beginning, for death and continuation. The further implication of the ex- change between Robert and Mr. Failing-that sensual love is a means of achieving social comradeship and democratic brotherhood-occurs frequently in Forster's fiction. The desire for sexual and social union imaged in The Longest Journey in the Janus-faced figure of Aphrodite is an expression of deeply felt historical and personal divisions. Heirs to the liberal tradition at Cambridge at the turn of the century were confronted with a conflict between humanistic principle and class privilege, between the generalizing sense of one's relation to a whole so- ciety and the intense parochialism involved in the formation of an intellectual elite. That such a conflict existed could not be ignored by Forster's generation as easily as it had been by previous generations of Cambridgians, for although Rickie and Ansell do not specify the reasons why the newspapers are complaining, as Rickie puts it, that "Cambridge has lost touch with the times" (62), these reasons were insistent and, despite Ansell's cavalier dis- missal, compelling. Forster's undergraduate years at Cambridge were a period when its legitimacy as an all-male and class-restricted school was being seri- ously challenged by women from Girton and Newnham and by graduates of</page><page sequence="18">254 NOVEL J SPRING 1987 the grammar schools, on whose behalf there were numerous attempts to strike down the compulsory entrance exam in Greek, which closed Cambridge to almost all applicants other than graduates of the classical public schools. Even before the first world war, Forster's class was threat- ened-above all, by the new industrial classes-with the same impotence as a social force that he feared sexually. His psychosexual dilemma coalesced with a continuing crisis in the social world. This dilemma is discernible only in its effects; it is to be understood, in re- lation to the symbolic text, as an absent cause, expressed in the text in oppo- sitions between competing desires, as well as in the opposition to basic desires which the text realistically puts forward but can find no way of surmounting. Rickie is caught in a logical double bind by his desire for union-between in- dividuals in marriage or within a small coterie or a university-and his im- pulse toward inclusion, which, paradoxically, results for him in isolation and separation. His longed-for acceptance into a select circle within Cambridge competes with his nonetheless strong desire to break down sexual taboos and class barriers which Cambridge helps to reinforce. Both the social conscience and sexual fantasies of Forster's ego character impel him to desire inclusion, but such an impulse is regarded as impractical and idealistic not only by the aggressively bourgeois world of Sawston, but by Rickie's Cambridge friends, whose own identity is threatened by the new claimants to power in England, especially women and men of a lower class. In reality, the university had taken on the landed gentry and the industrial bourgeoisie, but it lacked the creative energy to take on the laboring class. It lacked even historical memory of the actual poor scholars for whom it was originally intended. It is precisely Rickie's desire for an inclusive life (uniting mind and body, marriage and friendship, upper and lower classes) that, given his own sexual nature and his moment in history, defeats and isolates him just as it did Tony Failing. The narrative seeks a way, or ways, out of its basic antinomy, union + ex- clusion vs. inclusion + isolation, which is represented in its various permuta- tions by individual characters and character combinations. Borrowing A.J. Greimas' terminology, we may identify the basic semantic terms which form the primary antinomy of the text as "semes"-to which characters or combi- nations of characters, Greimas' "actants," are functionally equivalent.13 The combination of the semes union and exclusion is represented at the university by Rickie's and Ansell's set and, potentially, by Rickie and Ansell. At Sawston it is represented by the married couple, Rickie and Agnes; by the masters against the boys; by the strongest boys against the weakest; and by those attending Sawston school, where boys are taught sectarian religion un- der the banner of the Union Jack, against board school (non-public school) boys like Stephen. The combination of union and exclusion subsumes a 13 See Greimas, pp. 217-21, especially p. 218; and Schleifer's Introduction, pp. xl-xli. As Schleifer points out, the choice of ac- tants (that is, of characters in whom narrative functions are given anthropomorphic shape) "constitutes a process comple- mentary to discursive analysis" (p. xli). Frank Kermode's discussion of the genesis of narrative follows Greimas' definition of actants: "A function develops into a proper name; so it becomes a character, whose life and death have a narrative; and then the function is lost in the character" (94). Jameson discusses Greimas' methods in Thle Prison-House of Language, and he uses these methods extensively in The Politcial Unconscious.</page><page sequence="19">RAE H. STOLL FORSTER'S LONGINGS 255 institutions-not just monogamy-through which individuals illogically seek connection and completion. The semes inclusion and isolation also reflect an intolerable situation experi- enced by the main character. Whether driven to reject the social double bind of union and exclusion- easily translatable into xenophobia and elit- ism-because of socialist principle (Mr. Failing) or because of social and sex- ual desire (Rickie), those out of step with the present class system and the so- cial divisions it fosters are condemned by their very longing for inclusion to separation and isolation. The semic combinations that remain to be discovered include, first, what Greimas calls the neutral term-that is, the combination of the purely negative terms of the basic antinomy, exclusion + isolation. Representing this category are Herbert Pembroke and Mr. Wilbraham, members of the new managerial class which is assuming charge of the increasingly standardized British schools and large farms. Wilbraham's impersonal treatment of the farm laborers under his supervision, like Pembroke's of his students, parallels the divisive techniques of scientific management then being introduced into England. Mrs. Failing, whose snobbish eccentricities arising from the boredom of privilege lead her to divorce herself even from others in her own class, represents an older, but equally sterile, version of this seme. The same is true of her dilettante brother, Rickie's father. The remaining combination of semes-which Greimas designates as the complex term, or ideal synthesis between the semes projected in the text as desirable but seemingly hopelessly opposed-produces a utopian notion by which the text attempts to transcend the limitations of its own historical mo- ment. Union + inclusion is figured as a promise embodied in Stephen, who is called "heroic" because "he guided the future of our race, and ... century af- ter century, his thoughts and passions would triumph in England. The dead who had evoked him, the unborn whom he would evoke-he governed the paths between them" (289). Through the use of symbolism-the mystic rose, the eternal stream, the ancient Rings-Forster attempts to convey the experi- ence of wholeness which, according to Lacan, lies for each of us in our un- conscious or psychological past and is known to us only through the desire caused by its absence.14 Forster puts the wholeness for which we yearn in our future as well as in our past-fantasizing Stephen as the connecting link between past and future gratifications and suggesting that we are not psycho- logically or politically doomed to be divided from ourselves. Wholeness is a possibility for Forster as an attribute of a classless society and an unconven- tional family. The Janus-faced image of Aphrodite, the union of mother-broth- er-self (or mother-child-self), implies Forster's ideal solution to an historical and sexual impasse. Union may be achieved without exclusion only in a class- less society, whose counterpart is an unconventional family unmarked by the phallic intrusion of the law of sexual division. The heavy reliance on visual imagery and the anti-intellectualism which often appear in Forster's novels, 14 See Lacan's discussion of the mirror stage in Ecrits, pp. 1-7. For an elaboration of his concept of desire, see "The Meaning of the Phallus" in Feminine Sexuality, pp. 74-85.</page><page sequence="20">256 NOVEL SPRING 1987 the mistrust of articulated statement, may be a rejection of this law of the Fa- ther, which, as Lacan theorizes, situates and separates the subject in the sym- bolic order of discourse. As Jacqueline Rose writes, "[for Lacan] refusal of the phallic term brings with it an attempt to reconstitute a form of subjectivity free of division, and hence a refusal of the notion of symbolisation [language] itself" (56). It must be remembered that, in considering the attainment of adult male identity to be the result of successful negotiation of the Oedipal passage, we arrive at an idea about what constitutes maturity, as opposed to weakness and inadequacy, in a circular fashion. We believe that passing through the Oedipal stage, and accepting the Law of the Father, is realistic and mature; but we believe this because we have already defined reality and maturity as the ability to pass successfully through this stage. It is impossible to see that socialization and the law enforcing socialization are identical; therefore, it is impossible to see how arbitrary the Law is-and how arbitrary our definition, and valuation, of social "maturity" is-deri'ving as it does from our acceptance of the status of the phallus, which is, in fact, a fraud. Rickie tries to achieve a more inclusive reality than is permitted in the pre- given structure of social and sexual roles in the symbolic order, but he, too, is inhibited by his socialization so that he experiences sexual regret and social revulsion. Despite the attraction to Stephen that Forster himself expressed at various times in his life, Rickie's disapproval of Stephen, especially of his drinking and vulgarity, follows a pattern of attraction-repulsion on the part of an upper middle class character to a lower class character which, as Stone's essay on Forster and class demonstrates, occurs repeatedly in Forster's work. The misogyny of this novel, which is more overtly displayed in the posthu- mously published homosexual fiction, is another expression of a disabling sexual socialization. Despite its implicit questioning of phallocentric discourse, its struggle to achieve sexual and social inclusiveness, this text ultimately con- fronts an impasse which it cannot effectively resolve. That Forster should have shared with Shakespeare the conviction that failure to father children is a "famine" (Sonnet 1), a "murderous shame" committed against the self (Son- net 9), a self-killing (Sonnet 6) is painful to realize. But it is this realization that explains Rickie's relapse into anomie and the violence of his death which seems almost the punitive act of author against character. The judgment of Rickie is the same as that Shakespeare pronounces in Sonnet 11: "Let those whom Nature hath not made for store, / Harsh, featureless, and rude, bar- renly perish." By condemning his own "infirmity," by annihilating himself as a subject so that he may be replaced by another, Rickie engages in self-loath- ing and in mystification of the Other, rather than in genuine attempts to tran- scend the disfigurement of phallic discourse which has crippled him. As Lacan writes, "After all in being Other there is no need to know that one is" (Feminine Sexuality, 156). Instead of accepting himself, Rickie invests in an "ideal" self whom the text empowers with all the privileges of the resented Father-most specifically, with the power of naming.</page><page sequence="21">RAE H. STOLL FORSTER'S LONGINGS 257 There is no resolution to Rickie's dilemma within the conceptual-emotional schema of The Longest Journey. Rickie's consciousness remains disunified-torn within the system of differences in which he must live but to which he can- not "adapt." He is pulled between valuing the life of culture and the small co- terie and desiring the vitality of the body and democratic brotherhood; be- tween resentment and love of a woman; between the poles of a complex sexual and social psychology which, although it drives him to pursue his own self- knowledge in a series of Others, finally leads him back to his own in- firmity: his sense of incompleteness and his need to seek completion in im- possible fantasy rather than in self-acceptance.
