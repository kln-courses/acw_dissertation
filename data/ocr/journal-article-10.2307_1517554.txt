<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS an earlier version of the legend by critical analysis of the prologue and epilogue, parallels from the ancient Near East, the date and place of origin of the book, the separate poem in chapter xxviii and philosophical issues which are raised by the story. Among many stimulating remarks is the suggestion that more attention needs to be given to the social background presupposed in the poem (p. 128). A select bibliography and comprehen- sive indexes are included: it is surprising that the latter omits Fohrer's important review of Westermann's Der Aufbau des Buches Hiob, in VT 7 (1957), pp. 107-11, and W. B. Stevenson's Critical Notes on the Hebrew Text of the Poem of Job (Aberdeen, 1951), which is essential for an appreciation of the same author's The Poem of Job (London, 1947), which is included, albeit erroneously as The Problem ofJob (p. 167). Other misprints are "Jes 50,34" (for "Jer 50,34") on p. 92, "a la foi" (for "a la fois") on p. 107, the ascription of the title Hebrdische Wortforschung to the Festschrift for F.

Wood Lecture 1982. ii + 22 pp. University of London, 1982. This perceptive lecture discusses the principal difficulties of rendering the Psalter into English, not least those of evoking the imagery of the original, and judging whether the inconsistent or mixed use of imagery is a sign of textual corruption or of poetic art. Ackroyd rightly com- plains, for example, of the pedestrian character of, and loss of imagery in, Ps. xcii 11 (10 in English) in Today's English Version ( = The Good News Bible): "You have made me as strong as a wild bull; // you have blessed me with happiness. " His own rendering of the first line, "You have raised up my royal power, // like the horns of the wild ox ..." (wattdrem kir'em qarni), is clearly better, although it may be doubted whether the power symbolized by the horn is necessarily royal. The lecture ends with renderings of Pss. xlvi and xcv, and Ackroyd is to be com- mended for not merely discussing general principles and criticizing translations made by others, but-unlike some who have written on the subject-offering examples of his own attempts to render the Hebrew into English.

Annales Academiae Scientiarum Fen- nicae, Dissertationes Humanarum Litterarum 31. vi + 198 pp. Suomalainen Tietakatemia, Helsinki, 1982. This work by a pupil of I. Soisalon-Soininen is in two parts. The first examines the LXX translations of Hebrew clauses co- ordinated by waw in the Pentateuch, and the second evaluates the translation techniques. Differences in the various parts of the Pentateuch are noted, and it is thought likely that each of the five books was translated by a different person; it is also argued that theories of the dividing of the translation of particular books between two translators, one of whom translated the first part and the other the second, are improbable.

The first three chapters offer a critical survey of the discussion about the Hexateuch since 1938, with special reference to the work of G. von Rad, M. Noth, and S. Mowinckel. Auld then discusses the distribution of the land in Joshua and Numbers, Joshua and the Pentateuch, and retrospect and prospect. It is im- possible to summarize here the detailed argumentation and its results, but it may be noted that its conclusions include the importance of the LXX for the study of Joshua, the dependence of Numbers on Joshua for much of its account of the distribution of the land, and the view that Joshua does not contain con- tinuations of the Pentateuchal narratives. There are a bibliography, and in- dexes of Hebrew words, authors, biblical names, subjects, and biblical references. This is not everywhere an easy book to read, but it contains much meat. P. S. BEENTJES, Jesus Sirach en Tenach. xix + 218 pp. Published by the author at Preludelaantje 6, 3438 TT Nieuwegein, The Netherlands, 1981. 25 guilders + postage. This dissertation at the Katholieke Theologische Hogeschool, Amster- dam, was supervised by W. A. M. Beuken and N. J. Tromp. It investigates the use made by Ben Sira of the O.T., and illustrates the need for sound criteria by showing how previous scholars have differed in their identification of alleged references. What is needed is evidence of similarity not only of wording but also of content. Many passages with introductory formulae (hl', ky, 'mr, ktb) and without them are discussed, and the number of direct allusions in the latter is found to be smaller than most scholars have believed. The phenomenon of omkering (Beentjes suggests as a rendering the English phrase "inverted quota- tion" in Biblica 63 [1982], pp. 506-23), whereby words in an O.T. passage are cited in the reverse order, is examined, both in Ecclesiasticus and elsewhere in the Bible, and different types of it are distinguished. Unique combinations of words in the O.T. and in Ecclesiasticus are studied and evaluated. The last chapter discusses Ecclus xlv 6-26. The dissertation contains several excursuses, two bibliographies, a summary in German, and indexes of Ecclesiasticus, the O.T., the LXX, the Qumran literature, the Babylonian Talmud, and the Pseudepigrapha. W. BERG, Die Rezeption alttestamentlicher Motive im Neuen Testament, dargestellt an den Seewandelerzdhlungen. HochschulSammlung Theologie. Exegese Band 1. x + 374 pp. HochschulVerlag, Freiburg, 1979. Although this work, which has been shortened and revised for publication, was submitted as a Habilitationsschrift in O.T. (1978), its primary contribution is to the exegesis of three N.T. passages: Matt. xiv 22-27; Mark vi 45-52; John vi 16-21. Particular attention is paid, however, to their background in the O.T. and other texts, all of which are subjected to a painstaking analysis before their value for the N.T. passages is assessed. E. TOAFF (ed.), Collegio Rabbinico Italiano-Roma. Annuario di Studi Ebraici 9 (1977-9). 233 pp. Poligrafica Sabbadini, Rome, 1980. Appearing after a lapse of three years, this volume presents a collection of articles by A. S. Toaff (the editor's late father) on the history of the Jews in Leghorn, republished to mark the centenary of his birth, as well as six new articles on subjects ranging from Jewish identity to Byron's Hebrew Melodies.

Although the biographical appreciation (by Reif) and the bibliography of his writings show that Rosenthal is a scholar of broad interests within the Semitic field, this Festschrift is confined to a unified theme of wide appeal. Three essays are directly concerned with the O.T.: Emerton discusses the history of exegesis of Isa. vi 13 before advancing a fresh interpretation; C. Rabin argues for a date for Deuteronomy in the early Monarchy on the basis of "discourse analysis" (though surprisingly without any reference to Jeremiah); and A. Shivtiel sug- gests a new reading of Ps. cxiv 1. The relevance of the remaining essays should not be overlooked, however. Three deal with the Targum and Peshitta (S. P. Brock, R. P. Gordon, M. P. Weitzman), and two present new publications of texts from the Cairo Genizah in Cambridge University Library (N. R. M. de Lange, Reif), while D. Daube, R. J. Loewe, S. Morag, G. Vajda, and J. Weingreen deal with subjects relating to the Mishnaic and medieval fields. Finally, J. G. Snaith writes on "Aphrahat and the Jews", and R. E. Clements on H. Graetz as a biblical historian.

Tel-Aviv University, and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, New York, 1980. Originating in the author's disserta- tion (1969), supervised by S. D. Goitein at the University of Pennsylvania, this important work represents an additional decade of research and is of high scholarly standard and wide scope. The marriage documents discovered in the Cairo Genizah are shown to be a rich and novel source of information about the customs of the Jewish communities in Palestine before their destruction during the Crusades and how they relate to their equivalents in earlier times and dif- ferent countries. Vol. 1 discusses the legal, religious, and linguistic significance of the documents as well as their social and economic background. In vol. 2, 67 manuscripts, more than two thirds of them in Cambridge University Library, are transcribed, translated, explained, and annotated. There are also some Hebrew notes by S.

Atten- tion is directed principally to Exod. xxxii; Deut. ix 7-x 11; 1 Kings xii 26-33. The major problems of text, literary analysis, and the history of religions are discussed amidst a wealth of bibliographical information. While Hahn's opin-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK LIST 371 ions on many of these topics emerge from his assessment of earlier views, the book's chief value lies in its clear arrangement and presentation of such a mass of material.

T. Obbink, the Roman Catholic Canisius version, and the Nieuwe Vertaling of the Netherlands Bible So- ciety. An appendix deals with the Old Catholic andJewish translations. There is much that is interesting in this book, not least the account of the current contro- versy in the Netherlands between the champions of the so-called "dynamic equivalent" (a question-begging term) and "idiolect" methods.

This Festschrift includes a photograph of Wolff, a preface by the editors, an appreciation by R. Bohren, and 27 essays (4 in English, and the rest in German). Although the essays have been loosely grouped in four sections, which to a certain extent match the areas of study to which Wolff has contribu- ted ("Tetrateuch", "Deuteronomismus", "Prophetie", "Anthropologie"), the volume has little real unity of content. There are no indexes, and no list of Wolff's publications. G. E. KADISH and G. E. FREEMAN (ed.), Studies in Philology in Honour of Ronald James Williams. a Festschrift. xii + 160 pp. + 6 plates.

This volume in honour of a Professor of N.T. begins with a biographical sketch. Three of the seven essays are concerned with O.T prophecy. They deal with the origins of the eschatological prophecy of the exilic and post-exilic periods (Kilian), with Hosea's distinctive expectation for the future (D. Kinet), and with Isa. i 4-9, viewed as a post-exilic composition that "actualizes" Isaiah's message for a later age (W. Werner). J. R.

The English equivalents are made to conform as closely as possible to the text of the New International Version, which is printed in full on the right side of the page. This results paradoxically in some misleading renderings (e.g. "they-became" is not a literal translation of hehellu in 1 Sam. ii 2). Brief notes to the NIV and Hebrew texts give an indication of the passages where the translators have departed from the M.T. The whole O.T. is to be covered in four volumes. Those who make use of such aids will find this among the most attractively produced of its kind. G. LARSSON (ed.), Der ToseftatraktatJom hak-Kippurim. Text, Ubersetzung, Kommentar, 1.

Katzman. One essay briefly traces aspects of the theme's significance in the past, and another presents some ideas about how this "arch- symbol of Jewish self-identity" may be theologically relevant to contemporary Jews and Christians. The emphasis is on the inspirational rather than the scien- tific. T. N. D. METTINGER, The Dethronement of Sabaoth. Studies in the Shem and Kabod Theologies. Coniectanea Biblica, Old Testament Series 19. 160 pp. C. W. K. Gleerup, Lund, 1982. Sw.Kr. 70. Mettinger's starting point is the striking dif- ference of frequency of the phrase yhwh seba'ot in different books of the O.T. In pre-exilic times, people spoke of yhwh sebd'ot yoseb hakkeruzbim, and thought of Yahweh dwelling (yasab) in the Jerusalem temple with the cherubim as his throne, and the ark as his footstool. The thought of Yahweh dwelling in the temple seemed inappropriate after the events of 597 and 586, and the idea of his causing his name to dwell there was introduced into Deuteronomy, and the name theology was further developed by the later Deuteronomists; the phrase yhwh seba'ot thus tended to slip into the background. Ezekiel and the Priestly Writer, however, still thought of Yahweh's presence in the temple, but prefer- red to express the idea in terms of his kabod which was removed before the destruction of the temple but will later return, and P preferred the verb sdkan. Mettinger's detailed discussion and argument, illustrated by drawings from an- cient sources, contain much more than the above bare summary and must be read in full if their richness is to be appreciated. There are a bibliography, and indexes of biblical and Jewish sources, ancient Near Eastern sources, oriental words, subject matter, and authors. A lucid, well-documented, and substantial contribution to O.T. studies. P. D. MILLER, Sin and Judgment in the Prophets. A Stylistic and Theological Analysis. SBL Monograph Series 27. x + 143 pp. Scholars Press, Chico, 1982. $19.50; paperback $16. "This essay ... is a study of the device/pattern/motif of cor- respondence between sin and judgment, that is, the prophetic announcement that punishment will be according to, in some way like, or appropriate in either a</page><page sequence="6">BOOK LIST 373 literal or symbolic fashion to the sin committed" (p. 1). Ch. 1 examines rele- vant passages in the prophets of the 7th-6th centuries, other poetic texts, and the Former Prophets. Ch. 2 discusses the sources and setting of the pattern, compares other material from the ancient Near East (curses on inscriptions, treaties, laws, and also similar passages elsewhere in the O.T.), and analyses the material into three categories. Ch. 3 classifies the patterns. Ch. 4 discusses the theological principles correlating sin and judgement; judgement as the con- sequence of the fate-effecting deed; judgement as the retribution of God; judge- ment as purifying, reclaiming, renewing; judgement in the process of history. While Miller grants that there is some truth in K. Koch's theory of a cor- respondence between a deed and its consequences, he recognizes a greater amount of divine activity in the process. The book ends with a bibliography. J. NAVEH, Early History of the Alphabet. An Introduction to West Semitic Epigraphy and Palaeography. ix + 211 pp. + 24 plates. The Magnes Press, Jerusalem, and E.

VII), and it offers them a clear and extensive account of the subject by a leading scholar. After an introduction, there are chapters on the rise of the Semitic script, the South and West Semitic scripts, the development of the later Aramaic offshoots, and the antiquity of the Greek alphabet (which Naveh believes to have been adapted from the Phoenician alphabet as early as the 11th century B.C.). In addition to the plates, there are many drawings to illustrate the discussion, and there is an index of names and subjects. This book will doubtless become a standard introduction to the subject.

Some biblical texts are discussed, principally Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, but the work pays par- ticular attention to texts from the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, Josephus, and rabbinical sources.

This volume, the first to be published since M. J. Mulder became the General Editor in succession to P. A. H. de Boer (in whose time in office most of the work on Job was done), is a welcome addition to the series. Rignell read the first proofs, but it is sad that he died on 10 October 1981 and did not live to see the publication of the volume. L. ROST, The Succession to the Throne of David. Historic Texts and Interpreters in Biblical Scholarship 1. + 133 pp. Almond Press, Sheffield, 1982. ?15.95; ?6.95 paperback. An English translation of Rost's highly influential Die Uberlieferung von der Thronnachfolge Davids, first published in Stuttgart in 1926, has long been overdue. This translation by M. D. Rutter and D. M. Gunn is based on the reprint in Rost's Das kleine Credo und andere Studien zum Alten Testament (Heidelberg, 1965), pp. 119-253. Among minor changes introduced in the translation is the relegation of the long list of "Ark Narrative" vocabulary in ch. 1 to an appendix. (This, apparently, has nothing to do with the fact that subsequent scholarship has not been favourably impressed by Rost's attempts to identify a distinctive "Ark Narrative" vocabulary.) An index of authors has also been added, and there are several blank pages at the end to accommodate readers' notes. Rost, who himself had much to say about Hebrew narrative style, wrote more perspicuously than many of his colleagues (for example, M.</page><page sequence="7">374 BOOK LIST Noth, the first part of whose study of the Deuteronomistic History was translated for the sibling JSOT Supplement Series). The rare slips in translation occur when the German wording is followed too closely: e.g. "We will later return to this point once more" (p. 19); "With the blows of men was the house of David to be chastened" (p. 49). On p. 12, "in contradiction to" should be "in contradistinction to". There are a few spelling errors, but otherwise Rost's text is served well. The substantial introduction (carrying an abnormal load of notes) by E. Ball examines knowledgeably the background against which Rost worked, seeks to account for the remarkable influence which his slim volume has exercised, and takes some account of the refinements and revisions propos- ed in more recent studies. The way in which Pentateuchal sources are sloughed off by Rost is seen as particularly significant for the subsequent course of Samuel studies. His advocacy of the so-called "Succession Narrative" convinc- ed all but a few sceptics. Now that their number is beginning to increase, the translation of his work into English is indeed timely. At worst, it will enable English-speaking students to see why so many of their teachers have- perhaps-been led up the garden path. D. D. SCHMIDT, Hellenistic Greek Grammar and Noam Chomsky. Nominalizing Trans- formations. SBL Dissertation Series 62. x + 115 pp. Scholars Press, Chico, 1981. The chapters of this thought-provoking study are entitled: "The Present State of the Study of Hellenistic Greek Grammar"; "Contemporary Linguistic Theory"; and "Transformational Rules for Nominalization in Hellenistic Greek". A "nominalization" is defined informally as a syntactic device which allows an "embedded sentence" (traditionally, a dependent clause) to function nominally. The author has been involved in a research project and a language school which seek to apply Chomsky's theory of language to Hellenistic Greek grammar. His analyses may have some importance for the study of the LXX, even though the examples have been selected solely from the N.T. The book is well indexed and, equally valuable in a work of this kind, provided with a list of linguistic abbreviations. U. SIMON and M. H. GOSHEN-GOTTSTEIN (ed.), Studies in Bible and Exegesis. Arie Toeg in Memoriam (Hebrew). 255 pp. + 1 plate. Bar Ilan University Press, Ramat-Gan, 1980. U.S. $17. This is the first of Bar Ilan's Departmental Researches to be produced by the Department of Bible, and it reflects the in- terest of that department in combining modern critical scholarship with the best of traditional Jewish exegesis. Y. Elitzur writes about the boundary between the tribes of Benjamin and Ephraim (Josh. xvi 2); M. Margalioth examines the names of the husbands of Ruth and Orpah; and M. Garsiel and U. Simon tackle the literary problems of the Battle of Michmash (1 Sam. xiii-xiv), and Elijah's anti-Baal campaign (1 Kings xvii-xviii), respectively. On the medieval side, there are essays on the consonantal texts of manuscripts (M. Cohen), the relationship between the commentaries of Rashi and Joseph Kara on Job (M. Arend), and the system of adjacent verses in Moses Qimhi's commentary on Proverbs (J. Klein). The modern period is represented by Z. Weinberg's essay on Jacob Barth as a teacher of Isaiah at the Hildesheimer Seminary, and M. H. Goshen-Gottstein's survey of the interplay between Wissenschaft des Judentums, biblical research, and Jewish Bible theology. Dr Arie Toeg, a promising young biblical scholar, fell in the Yom Kippur "when the ink had hardly dried on the pages of his doctoral dissertation", and the volume includes a photograph of him, and the text of a memorial address.

His treatment of the subject is lucid and is, of course, written on the basis of a thorough acquaintance with the many scholarly problems involv- ed. The second and third parts, on early Judaism and the N.T., respectively, are by Luz, and the Nachwort is by both authors. J. A. SOGGIN, Judges. A Commentary. Old Testament Library. xx + 305 pp. S.C.M. Press, London, 1981. ?8.50. An introduction of 13 pages, and a substantial and well-informed commentary. The translation, which was made byJ. S. Bowden from an Italian manuscript, is readable but could sometimes have been improv- ed (e.g. "like a dog does", p. 134; "identical to", p. 147; "Gibeonites" of the men of Gibeah, p. 287). The author recognizes the importance of maps (p. xi), and it would be helpful if some were added when a second edition is needed. A book that every O.T. scholar should possess. R. SONSINO, Motive Clauses in Hebrew Law. SBL Dissertation Series 45. xix + 336 pp. Scholars Press, Chico, 1980. This dissertation (1975) treats an aspect of biblical law which has often been commented on, but has not previously received an ex- tended examination. After a general consideration of biblical and cuneiform law, the motive clauses are carefully distinguished from other similar phenomena and subjected to an analysis of their form, distribution, content, and function. Evidence for motive clauses in non-biblical law is presented and compared with the biblical examples, and a case is argued for the possibility that a motive clause was, at least sometimes, an original part of a law, rather than a secondary accretion. Throughout his study the author draws attention to similarities between law and wisdom literature, thus continuting the approach of scholars such as E. Gerstenberger. The motive clauses are usefully tabulated and cited in Hebrew in an appendix of 70 pages, and there are a bibliography and indexes. This is a valuable, well-presented account of the subject. The pro- posal to replace A. Alt's distinction between apodictic and casuistic law with one between unconditional and conditional law (each with sub-divisions) deserves attention. S.

Stuttgarter Biblische Beitrage. 208 pp. Verlag Katholisches Bibelwerk, Stuttgart, 1979. DM 26.80. The theme of "reinterpretation" or "relecture" within the O.T. is here examined in an original way by consideration of, on the one hand, a long-lived cultic institution and, on the other, a group of texts with closely-related subject matter. These studies are of importance in their own right: the first for its caution in admitting only texts that are certainly, or very probably, connected with the autumn festival, the second for its attempt to trace a development in the Israelite royal ideology (or ideologies) by reference both to differences between earlier and later psalms and to additions that were made to particular psalms. Motifs of the royal psalms are also followed backwards to their sources in Israel's environ- ment, and forwards into other types of biblical literature. A final chapter defines the character of "reinterpretation" in the light of these studies, and identifies some topics that need further investigation. J. J.

This congratulatory volume consists of 15 of Stamm's studies of Semitic names, here for the most part reproduced photographically from their original homes in other volumes and journals. Some misprints in the originals are listed on pp. 261-2. The article en-</page><page sequence="9">376 BOOK LIST titled "Namen rechtlichen Inhalts II", a continuation of the theme developed by Stamm in his contribution to H. Donner et al. (ed.), Beitrdge zur alt- testamentlichen Theologie. Festschrift fur Walther Zimmerli (G6ttingen, 1977), pp. 460-78 (cp. VT 32 [1982], p. 512), appears for the first time. So too does the final item, "Der Name Nabal", which was written for the overdue volume in honour of the late I. L. Seeligmann. There are also indexes of names in various Semitic languages, and a list of Stamm's publications. J. STRANGE, Caphtor/Keftiu. A New Investigation. Acta Theological Danica 14. 228 pp. E. J. Brill, Leiden, 1980. 54 guilders. This Copenhagen dissertation (1979) on the identification of Caphtor (known to the Egyptians as Keftiu) ex- amines 58 texts in six classes: geographical texts, texts with pictorial representa- tions (there are 10 photographs or drawings), "historical" narratives, mythological narratives, documentary texts and texts in which the reading Kef- tiu or Caphtor is uncertain. Various identifications are discussed, and it is argued that Cyprus is the most probable. There are also a Danish summary, a bibliography of works cited, two maps, diagrams of Caphtor/Keftiu, and in- dexes of ancient texts, names and subjects, and modern authors. This work is valuable for its discussion, not only of the identification of Caphtor, but also of many other questions (e.g. the location of Alaskiya). A. STRUS, Nomen-Omen. La stylistique sonore dans les noms propres dans le Pentateuque. Analecta Biblica 80. xii + 253 pp. Biblical Institute Press, Rome, 1978. L.It. 15000; U.S. $20. After two chapters on method, this revision of a dissertation (1976) at the Pontifical Biblical Institute examines the play on words involving proper names in the Pentateuch. It concludes with a classified bibliography, tables setting out the material discussed, and indexes of biblical references and names of authors. The discussion of the use of proper names contains much that is interesting, and it will need to be taken into account by future scholars, but some points are made that are questionable. For example, not all readers will feel certain that the assonance between ham and harmds in Gen. vi 10-11 (p. 91) is anything but accidental, and some may doubt whether a play on the words 'addmrn, Ceden, qedem, and m6t tamutt is intended in Gen. ii 4-17 (pp. 114-16); but the relevant words do at least appear in the text. It may, however, seem far fetched to postulate that meldkim in Gen. xxxv 11 is meant to suggest the word sdrim, which does not appear, and so a play on the name yisra'el in v. 10 (p. 92); or that 'al-tehad in Gen. xlix 9 was likely in a similar way to bring to mind 'al-tilldweh, and thus a play on lewi (p. 94). Greater care might have been taken in checking the names of scholars. For example, there are errors in the in- itials of R. Meyer, C. A. Simpson, and S. Talmon; P. E. Kahle twice appears as B. P. Kahle; I. H. Eybers is given different initials (I. E.,J. E., andJ. H.) in different places, but never the correct ones; and Derek Kidner's degree of M.A. has become his initials. A. H. McNeile and H. Seebass, respectively, are given one letter too many and one letter too few in their surnames, andJ. I. Durham has become J. J. Durham, while Trevor Donald's Christian name and surname have been inverted. S. R. Driver and his son G. R. Driver are ignominiously assimilated in the index as "R. Driver". Student Map Manual. Historical Geography of the Bible Lands. 170 pp. Pictorial Archives (Near Eastern History) Est., Jerusalem, 1979, distributed by Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, Michigan. $34.95. This atlas was designed to be used with the slides of the Wide Screen Project, but it is also very useful on its own. It contains numerous maps of the Holy Land: regional maps, to show archaeological sites, and maps to illustrate the history of various periods down to Byzantine times. The best use of space is sought by arranging the maps with the east, rather than the north, at the top of each page. There are also maps of</page><page sequence="10">BOOK LIST 377 Jerusalem in different periods. Further help is offered by references to the Bible and relevant modern literature, and there is space for the addition of notes. There are indexes of alternative names of places, and of main names (with diagrams indicating the relevant archaeological and historical maps, and the grid references). An invaluable aid to biblical study. A. TAL (ROSENTHAL), The Samaritan Targum of the Pentateuch. a Critical Edition, 2 vols.

This edition prints on opposite pages (in square Hebrew script) the text of Ms. Or. 7562 of the British Museum and Ms. 3 of the Shechem Synagogue un- til Num. xxix; after that, only the former is printed, because the latter has been copied from it. The former manuscript is printed unchanged, apart from the removal of some obvious errors and the filling in of lacunae, and the fact is noted in such places in an upper apparatus; the latter is printed without change, and an upper apparatus comments on some of the defects. The lower apparatus records variant readings of other manuscripts. The first volume contains Genesis and Exodus, and the second the rest of the Pentateuch. S. TALMON (ed.), Textus: Annual of the Hebrew University Bible Project 9. 136 (English) + 54 (Hebrew) pp. + 2 plates. Magnes Press, Jerusalem, 1981. We welcome the reappearance of this annual after an interruption of eight years. It is now reproduced from typescript (including the use of Greek and Hebrew, but not Syriac, characters), and is bound in soft covers. This volume includes a brief report on the work of the Hebrew University Bible Project, 1974-81, and 6 ar- ticles (4 in English, and 2 in Hebrew) on various aspects of the transmission of the Hebrew Bible, including one of 90 pages by J. S. Penkower on "Maimonides and the Aleppo Codex". The main articles are provided with Hebrew or English abstracts, as the case may be. The editor expresses the hope that "future volumes will be published at appropriate intervals". S.TALMON (ed.), Textus: Annual of the Hebrew University Bible Project 10. 36 (English) + 68 (Hebrew) pp. Magnes Press, Jerusalem, 1982. E. Tov writes on the "Lu- cianic" text of Esther. M. L. Klein presents a new edition of a Palestinian Fragment-Targum from the Cairo Genizah (BM Or. 10794, fol. 8). L. H. Schiffman discusses the interchange of the prepositions b and m in the Qumran texts, and M. Cohen devotes a long study to "Systems of light Gacyot in Medieval Biblical Manuscripts". There are two articles in Hebrew (with English abstracts): Y. Maori lists the pisqdaot in the Isaiah texts from Qumran, and compares them with several Massoretic manuscripts as a complement to Apparatus II in the Bible Project's edition of Isaiah. I. Yeivin studies various aspects of the manuscript Leningrad L2. There is also an index of the first ten volumes. E. TALSTRA, F. POSTMA, and H. VAN ZWET, Deuterojesaja.

The usefulness of computers as tools for various aspects of linguistic and stylistic analysis of biblical texts is well established. Het Oude Testament in de Komputer (OTIK) is a project of the Free University's Faculty of Theology that aims to develop this potential. The pre- sent book not only examplifies their work, but also illustrates the kind of infor- mation that the computer can produce. Thus, for Isa. xl-lv we are presented with a full print-out of the following features: two imperatives in the same line of text; the combination of nhm and Cm, and of Cm andyrwslm in the same verse; a form of the imperfect of 'mr followed immediately by a noun; 'sr followed by a form of the imperfect; and ki followed by a form of the perfect. Most of these</page><page sequence="11">BOOK LIST elements are of potential help for the exegesis of Isa. xl 1-2. The bulk of the book consists of a complete concordance of Isa. xl-lv. S. TENGSTR6M, Die Hexateucherzdhlung. Eine literaturgeschichtliche Studie. Coniectanea Biblica, Old Testament Series 7. viii + 186 pp. C. W. K. Gleerup, Lund, 1976. Sw.Kr. 51. Tengstrom reviews the different approaches to the composi- tion of the Hexateuch, and favours "eine literaturgeschichtliche Erweiterungs- theorie" (p. 16). The basis was, he believes, an epic composed before the monarchy (probably in the early 11th century) in or near Shechem, the centre of the Rachel tribes, and of the twelve-tribe league of which they were the most important part. This epic, which was transmitted in written form, was expand- ed at various times, and the present Hexateuch was the result-and Tengstr6m thinks in terms of the Hexateuch, not just the Pentateuch, let alone a Tetrateuch. An examination of Gen. xi 27-xiii 18 leads him to believe that the principal themes are the promises that the descendants of Abraham will multip- ly, and that they will possess the land of Canaan. The former promise is fulfilled during the stay in Egypt, and the latter in the settlement recorded in Joshua, and the story reaches its climax and conclusion in Josh. xxiv. The Sinai nar- rative is regarded as a later addition to the epic. Many important questions are discussed in this book such as the origin of the Deuteronomic movement, the system of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the Song of Deborah (which reflects the outlook of some of the northern tribes). The book ends with a list of passages ascribed to the Grunderzdhlung, a bibliography, and an index of biblical references. E. TESTA, La missione e la catechesi nella Bibbia. Studia Urbaniana 14. 439 pp. Paideia Editrice, Brescia, 1981. L.It. 18,000. A thorough study of the concepts of mission and catechesis in the O.T. and N.T. The interest of the book lies in its treatment of a subject which has been largely ignored as far as the O.T. is concerned. J. THURUTHMALY, Blessing in St Paul. vii + 328 pp. Pontifical Institute of Theology and Philisophy, Alwaye, Kerala, India, 1981. This book by the Vice-Rector of the Pontifical Institute at Alwaye is primarily concerned with the N.T., but it also discusses words for blessing in the Hebrew Bible, the LXX, and early Judaism. E. Tov, A Classified Bibliography of Lexical and Grammatical Studies of the Language of the Septuagint, revised and enlarged edn. ii + 46 pp. Academon, Jerusalem, 1982. This revision of a classified bibliography of various aspects of LXX studies successfully meets a scholarly need. There is an index of Greek words. E. Tov, The Text-Critical Use of the Septuagint in Biblical Research. Jerusalem Biblical Studies 3. 343 (English) + 7 (Hebrew) pp. Simor Ltd, Jerusalem, 1981. U.S. $17. "This book deals with method, and it is intended both for the beginner student and for the scholar" (p. 11), and it meets a long-felt need. After a substantial introduction, there are chapters on the question when to reconstruct variants, the nature of the Hebrew text underlying the LXX, and the evalua- tion of retroverted variants in biblical research. There are indexes of biblical passages, authors, and subjects. It is impossible to speak too highly of this book for its lucidity, soundness of judgement, and general helpfulness, and for the amount of ground that it covers and its abundant examples. It may be recom- mended without reserve. J. C. TREVOLLE BARRERA, Salomdn y Jeroboan. Historia de la recension y redaccidn de 1 Reyes, 2-12; 14. Bibliotheca Salmanticensis, Dissertationes 3. 1+ 524 pp. Universidad Pointificia, Salamanca, 1980. It is well known that the disciplines of textual, literary, and historical criticism are more than usually intertwined in the description of Solomon's reign and its immediate sequel in 1 Kings. This 378</page><page sequence="12">BOOK LIST 379 dissertation, supervised by A. Diez Macho at the University of Madrid, at- tempts a comprehensive study of these problems, though discussion of the text- ual history predominates. The formidable array of secondary literature in the bibliography is well handled in the course of the work. M.TSEVAT, The Meaning of the Book of Job and Other Biblical Studies. Essays on the Literature and Religion of the Hebrew Bible. viii + 216 pp. Ktav Publishing House, New York, and the Institute for Jewish Studies, Dallas, 1980. Two of the eleven essays in this volume are published for the first time ("Hagar and the Birth of Ishmael", and "Israelite History and the Historical Books of the Old Testament"), and a further two have previously been available only in Hebrew ("The Biblical Account of the Foundation of the Monarchy in Israel", and "The Throne Vision of Isaiah"). There is an index. E. ULLENDORFF and C. F. BECKINGHAM, The Hebrew Letters of PresterJohn. xiv + 252 pp. Oxford University Press, 1982. ?12. This book is not relevant to O.T. studies, but is of interest to many Hebraists. It is an edition of the Hebrew text of three medieval letters, purportedly written by Prester John to an unnamed Pope, the Emperor Frederick, and Pope Eugenius, respectively. The text is ac- companied by an annotated translation, and there are an introduction, chapters on relevant subjects, a bibliography, facsimiles of editions or manuscripts in Hebrew and other languages, and an index.

Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis 31. 255 pp. Universitatsverlag, Freiburg, Schweiz, and Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, G6t- tingen, 1980. The concept of an institution is first defined (in dependence on the sociologists P. L. Berger and T. Luckmann) rather more widely than is nor- mal in O.T. studies, and it is then shown that not only is Hosea's message con- cerned with important Israelite institutions (monarchy, cult), but Hosea himself was conscious of his own "institutional" status as Yahweh's represen- tative before the people, a status which he evidently understood in legal terms. Particular attention is given to Hos. ix 1-9 and xii 1-15. L. VEGAS MONTANER, Biblia del Mar Muerto. Profetas Menores. Textos y Estudios "Cardenal Cisneros" 29. xxxiii+ 112 pp. Instituto "Arias Montano", Madrid, 1980. This useful work publishes the text of the Minor Prophets found in various manuscripts from Qumran and Murabbcat. There are also descrip- tions of the manuscripts, a list of variants, and an index of manuscripts and their contents. P. VIDAL-NAQUET, II buon uso del tradimento. Flavio Giuseppe e la guerra giudaica. Biblioteca di storia antica 9. 192 pp. Editori Riuniti, Rome, 1980. L.It. 5800. A translation into Italian of FlaviusJosiphe ou du bon usage de la trahison (Editions de Minuit, Paris, 1977). Josephus is depicted against the background of cultural diversity in first-century Palestine, and is seen as something of a mediatorial figure standing between Jewish and Roman culture. An appendix gives an Italian rendering of Vidal-Naquet's essay, "Flavius Josephe et Masada", first published in Revue historique 260 (1978), pp. 3-21. There is a twelve-page introduction by A. Momigliano. E.VOGT, Untersuchungen zum Buch Ezechiel. Analecta Biblica 95. x + 180 pp. Biblical Institute Press, Rome, 1981. L.It. 16,500; U.S. $18.35. Various passages from Ezekiel are dealt with, but not according to any set pattern. Rather, Vogt has restricted himself to writing on those matters about which he has something fresh and positive to say. The main concern seems to be to distinguish between primary and secondary literary layers, but textual criticism, interpretation, and even realia are sometimes included. Four of the six chapters are related to aspects of the visionary material in Ezek. i-iii, viii-xi, and xl-xlviii. Other sub-</page><page sequence="13">380 BOOK LIST jects include Ezekiel's dumbness and his role as "watchman", "life" and "death" in Ezek. xviii and xxxiii, the "laws that were not good" in xx 25-6, and the identification of the river Chebar. These varied researches, some of which have been previously published elsewhere, are adequately indexed. A. VAN DER WAAL, Amos. Een systematische literatuurlyst. viii + 144 pp. Boekhandel/ uitgeverij, Free University, Amsterdam, 1981. 19.50 guilders. The author has sought to give as complete a list as possible of publications about Amos since 1550. The entries are classified according to their character (e.g. commentaries, language, theology, particular verses). An indispensable tool for further work on Amos. P. WEIMAR, Die Berufung des Mose. Literaturwissenschaftliche Analyse von Exodus 2,23- 5,5. Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis 32. 399 pp. Universitaitsverlag, Freiburg, Schweiz, and Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, G6ttingen, 1980. Although devoted mainly to to a detailed examination of three original sources and three redac- tional layers which Weimar believes to be present in this section, the study also includes a more wide-ranging consideration of the place and date of origin of J (Judah, not Jerusalem, c. 900), E (Bethel, c. 800), an additional source (Jerusalem, contemporary with Isaiah), and RJE (under Manasseh). Apart from the additional source, Weimar's analysis is notably chiefly for the exten- sive Priestly redaction which he envisages in these chapters. P. WEIMAR, Untersuchungen zur Redaktionsgeschichte des Pentateuch. BZAW 146. x + 183 pp. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin and New York, 1977. DM 82. This at- tempt to solve the problem of the composition of the Pentateuch begins with the three stories in which a patriarch pretends that this wife is his sister. Contrary to the usual opinion, it is argued that Gen. xii 10-20 is the youngest, not the oldest, of the three, and that its author knew the other two but no other tradi- tion. The use of the expressionyrd misrayma in xii 10 recalls Isa. xxx 2 and xxxi 1, where there is also the same idea that one should trust Yahweh, and not rely on one's own plans. Gen. xii 10-20 is, therefore, dated c. 700 B.C. The oldest of the three stories is found in Gen. xxvi 6, 7*, 8, 9 and comes from the time of David. E knew the older story and no other tradition, but modified it and transferred it from Isaac to Abraham in Gen. xx. The two older forms of the story were later subject to redactional expansion, to which some of the similarities among the three are to be ascribed. The investigation is then ex- tended to Gen. ii 4b-iv 26, vi 1-xi 9. Finally, a complicated theory of the growth of the Pentateuch as a whole is set out-and, like the discussion summarized above, it contains much detail that cannot be set out here. (1) The first stage was the writing down of stories and collections of stories after the settlement and in the early monarchy. (2) The J document (which is found within the limits of Gen. ii 4b and Num. xiv) was written in conservative circles, which were not influenced by the wisdom of the royal court, against the background of the age of Solomon. (3) The E document, which begins with Gen. xv and goes no far- ther than the story of Sinai, comes from prophetic circles in North Israel in the age of Amos and Hosea. It was not long and has, contrary to the usual view, been preserved in full. (4) Various stories (including Gen. xii 10-20) originated in the reign of Hezekiah. (5) Early in the seventh century, the Jehovist combin- ed J and E and other material, and continued the story beyond the end of JE until Josh. xxiv. (6) A first Deuteronomistic redaction took place soon after 597. (7) In or after the exile, a second Deuteronomistic redaction united the docu- ment with the Deuteronomistic history. (8) A collection of priestly material was made in the time of Deutero-Isaiah. (9) Pg was composed in Babylonia in the early post-exilic period. (10) Pg was expanded by the addition of ps, including legal material. (11) pg + ps was combined in about 400 with the other narrative,</page><page sequence="14">BOOK LIST 381 which extended from Genesis to the end of 2 Kings, but the combined work was divided after the death of Moses, and so the present Pentateuch came into be- ing. There are a bibliography, and an index of biblical references. J. WEINGREEN, Introduction to the Critical Study of the Text of the Hebrew Bible. ix + 103 pp. Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, 1982. ?5.50. This in- troduction is designed to help students when they first move from the study of grammar to a critical reading of the M.T. It is thus much less technical than some other well-known text-books in the field. Nevertheless, the standard types of scribal error are described and illustrated with examples that are generally convincing, since Weingreen draws whenever possible on parallel passages or comparison between the M.T. of Isaiah and lQIsa. Note should also be made of the particular attention paid to rabbinic antecedents of textual criticism, which are often ignored in works of this kind. Despite a correct emphasis in the Introduction and Conclusion on the care and accuracy with which the text of the Hebrew Bible has generally been preserved, some less attentive readers of the book may gain the unfortunate impression that the work of a textual critic is merely to copy out the text without vowel points or word division and see what he can make of the result; a few more cautionary words en passant would have been welcome. Presumably, the spelling "Jewish Chronical" on the dust cover is a first exercise for the beginner. R. WEISS, Studies in the Text and Language of the Bible (Hebrew). x + 372 pp. The Magnes Press, Jerusalem, 1981. When Raphael Weiss died tragically in 1974 at the age of 34, he left behind many contributions to scholarship including his M.A. thesis, his doctoral dissertation, and a number of articles published in various languages. His dissertation was published in 1979, and the remainder of his work is presented here, translated into Hebrew where necessary. The many and varied studies relate mostly to the text of the Hebrew Bible, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and lQtgJob. J. WELLHAUSEN, Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels. 6. Ausg. (Neudruck), 1927. viii + 424 S.; ders., Israelitische undjiidische Geschichte. 9. Aufl., 1958. viii + 371 S. Unverainderter photomechanischer Nachdruck. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin und New York, 1981. DM 78/DM 68. Von diesen beiden klassischen Werken der alttestamentlichen Wissenschaft war seit langenJahren nur eins, die Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels, im Buchhandel zu haben, und auch dies nur in englischer Sprache (die Israelitische undjiidische Geschichte ist merkwiirdigerweise nie englisch erschienen). Nun sind beide wieder in der letzten Gestalt, die Wellhausen ihnen gegeben hat, greifbar. Hoffentlich wird der verhaltnismaifig hohe Preis keinen Interessanten abschrecken, sie zu kaufen. Der Streit um Wellhausen vermag die Gemiiter heute beinahe wieder zu erregen wie vor hundert Jahren. Die Neuausgabe sollte dafir sorgen, daif in diesen Streit nicht nur alte Vorurteile zu Wort kommen, sondern auch Wellhausen selbst. Vieles, was er gesagt hat, wirkt geradezu modern, und seine herrliche Prosa schliigt jeden empfanglichen Leser noch immer in ihren Bann. R. R. WELLS, James Barr and the Bible. Critique of a New Liberalism. viii + 406 pp. Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co., Phillipsburg, N.J., 1980. $12. This dissertation at the Free University of Amsterdam describes Barr's writings on biblical interpretation, and discusses them from a very conservative point of view. Wells's interests seem to be primarily in the field of doctrine, rather than O.T. studies. The discussion seeks to present Barr's thought fairly, and sometimes even sympathetically, but it is, of course, critical. It is useful to have a critique of Barr from the point of view for which Wells stands. G. J. WENHAM, Numbers. Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries. 240 pp. Inter- Varsity Press, Leicester, and Downes Grove, Illinois, 1981. Paperback, ?4.95.</page><page sequence="15">382 BOOK LIST In conformity with the policy of the series in which it appears, this commentary presents a conservative understanding of the text, and also considers its mean- ing for the Christian reader. Wenham is well informed and shows acquaintance with much recent literature (though it is surprising that the discussion of Balaam fails to mention the evidence from Deir CAlla). He refrains from asser- ting the Mosaic authorship of Numbers, but he criticizes the classical theory of source analysis and the arguments for a late date, and maintains that it "is perhaps fairer to give the tradition the benefit of the doubt, than to assume everything must be late unless there is evidence to the contrary" (p. 24). He can face issues honestly, and the discussion on pp. 60-6 of the large numbers of Israelites does not claim to offer a clear-cut solution to the problem. There are three maps. Even those who do not share the theological outlook of the series can read this well-written commentary with profit. C. WESTERMANN, Praise and Lament in the Psalms. vii + 301 pp. T. &amp; T. Clark, Edinburgh, 1981. ?4.95. The German original, Lob und Klage in den Psalmen (G6ttingen, 1977), was described in VT 28 (1978), p. 513. This work incor- porates K. R. Krim's translation, The Praise of God in the Psalms (Richmond, Virginia, 1965; London, 1966), of Das Loben Gottes in den Psalmen, and the addi- tional material has been translated by R. N. Soulen, who has added Wester- mann's article, "The Role of the Lament in the Theology of the Old Testa- ment", Interpretation 28 (1974), pp. 20-38. The translator has made some change in the bibliography (though some errors have not been corrected, for on p. 282 the initials of H. W. Robinson and G. R. Castellino are in the wrong order, and, in contrast to the original, the editions of RGG are not stated). Thus, English translations are substituted, where they exist, for German originals (it would have been more scholarly to note both), and I. Engnell's Studies in Divine Kingship is cited in the second edition (though p. 165 refers only to the first), and the places of publication, and even the names of publishers, are added. Not all the additions are satisfactory: it is not stated that the second edi- tion (which is mentioned) of M. Noth's Uberlieferungsgeschichtliche Studien was published in Tiibingen, and not in Halle like the first; S. Mowinckel's Psalmenstudien I-VI of 1921-4 are said on p. 285 to have been published by P. Schippers in Amsterdam, whereas that information is true only of the much later reprint (and Kristiania is correctly said on pp. 165, 283 to have been the place of publication); only the U.S. edition of Mowinckel's The Psalms in Israel's Worship is noted on pp. 166, 285, but the British edition is mentioned on pp. 269 (where it is erroneously credited to the Oxford University Press) and 283 (where the publisher is correctly said to be Basil Blackwell)-why were not both editions mentioned in the bibliography? The place of publication of The Anchor Bible is Garden City, New York, not New York (city) as is said on p. 286. It may also be noted that A. Bentzen is given the initials A. B., presumably because the second letter of the abbreviation "z. B." is wrongly printed in italics on p. 197 of the German original. Bibliographical details are important in a scholarly work, and it is to be hoped that they will be corrected in any future edition. Nevertheless, this translation of a major work of a leading Ger- man scholar is welcome, and it deserves to be widely read. There is an index of references to the Bible and other ancient texts. R. N. WHYBRAY, Two Jewish Theologies. Job and Ecclesiastes. 17 pp. University of Hull, 1980. 75 p. This inaugural lecture at Hull examines the thought of Job and Ecclesiastes and finds that despite the differences "in their conclusions they are remarkably similar ...

There are seven maps, and indexes of subjects, names, authors, and biblical references. I. YEIVIN, Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah. SBL Masoretic Studies 5. x + 324 pp. Scholars Press, Missoula, 1980. This work was originally written in Hebrew and has been translated and edited by E. J. Revell. The three parts describe the manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible, the Masorah, and the accents, and there is an appendix on shewa, daghesh, and raphe. There are also a list of modern works cited, and annotated list of earlier scholars and sources, and an index of subject matter. Reliable information about innumerable details of the M.T., which often puzzle readers, is provided by a master of the subject, and this is an in- dispensable work of reference. The translator has done his job well (though it is strange to find "apparati" used on p. 9, apparently as the plural of "ap- paratus"), and has earned the thanks of all scholars of the Hebrew Bible who can read English. G. D. YOUNG (ed.), Ugarit in Retrospect. Fifty Years of Ugarit and Ugaritic. xvi + 238 pp. + 1 map. Eisenbrauns, Winona Lake, Indiana, 1981. This book con- tains papers read in Madison, Wisconsin, in February 1979 at a symposium organized by Middle West groups of the American Oriental Society and the Society of Biblical Literature: "Ugarit and the Great Powers" (M. C. Astour); "Ugarit: a Canaanite Thalassocracy" (E. Linder); recent epigraphic discoveries at Ras Shamra and Ras Ibn Hani (P. Bordreuil); new epigraphic evidence from Tel Aphek (D. I. Owen-a summary, not the full paper); "Some Egyptological considerations Concerning Ugarit" (R. Giveon); the place of excavations at Ras Shamra in archaeological study of ancient Syria in general (R. H. Dornemann); "Nouvelles Perspectives des Fouilles" (J. Margueron); "Literary Criticism, Folklore Scholarship, and Ugaritic Literature" J. M. Sasson); "Ugarit and the Bible" (P. C. Craigie); "Ugaritic and Hebrew Metrics" (D. Pardee); "The Geographical Setting of the AQHT Story" (B. Margalit); "The Cult of the Dead at Ugarit" (M. H. Pope); "Ugarit in Retrospect and Prospect" (C. H. Gordon). There is also a report of</page><page sequence="17">384 BOOK LIST a Panel discussion", in which several of those listed above spoke extempore, and there was, after their sometimes long and not always well-organized remarks, a very brief time for questions from the floor. It would probably have been better if this chapter had been omitted from the book. Textual critics will note some errors resulting from a faulty hearing of the tapes and a failure to edit the transcripts adequately (e.g. memitim hayyeh instead of memit ume.hayyeh on p. 185; "addition" instead of "edition" on p. 191). The discussion can even refer on p. 191 to something that was presumably said in the original form of a paper but does not appear in the published form. There are a useful bibliography, and six indexes. Though O.T. scholars will be interested in all the articles, they will particularly value those of Craigie and Pardee, which are to be commended for their balance, common sense, and scepticism towards some current theories. At the same time, the great value of the discoveries at Ras Shamra for O.T. studies is acknowledged, and Craigie rightly recognizes that even the "manic aspects of 'pan-Ugaritism,' modified by the depressive reaction of criticism, can result ultimately in real progress" (p. 111). This book deserves to be widely read. Z. ZEVIT, Matres Lectionis in Ancient Hebrew Epigraphs. American Schools of Oriental Research Monograph Series 2. x + 43 pp. American Schools of Oriental Research, Cambridge, Mass., 1980. This valuable study of the evidence, with a bibliography, surveys the problem, and then devotes chapters to the evidence of the 8th century B.C. in Israel, and the 8th-7th and 6th centuries and the period after the 6th century in Judah. Zevit believes that recent epigraphic evidence "has tended to conform to the general pattern of the development described" by F. M. Cross and D. N. Freedman, "but not to their timetable" (p. 2), for he favours an earlier date for the use of matres lectionis in Hebrew. B. M. ZLOTOWITZ, The Septuagint Translation of the Hebrew Terms in Relation to God in the Book ofJeremiah. xxvi + 196 pp. Ktav, New York, 1981. $20. Originally a dissertation (1974) at the New York School of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, prepared under the supervision of H. M. Orlinsky, who provides a short introductory essay on anthropomorphism and anthropopa- thism in the LXX and Targums. A good proportion of the book is used to set out the respective Hebrew and Greek texts, and there is only sporadic discus- sion of points of interest. The sum of the matter is that the LXX of Jeremiah shows no anti-anthropomorphic tendency.</page></plain_text>
