<plain_text><page sequence="1"></page><page sequence="2">Portuguese Ceramicist Manuel Mafra NATURE, EXOTICISM AND LUXURY Cristina Ramos e Horta peculiar body of ceramic artwork, blending local tradition and revivalist foreign models in the decorative arts prevailing in Europe - mainly French and English neo-Palissy styles - emerged in the second half of the nineteenth century in Caldas da Rainha,1 a small town in central west Portugal. Introduced there by the skilled hand of Manuel Mafra, this style developed into a school that inspired other local ceramists. The production underwent a marked evolution, reaching its peak and fame with Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro (1842-1905), who retained a Portuguese spirit and integrated a European naturalism. This article examines the importance and wide acceptance of Manuel Mafra's ceramics, which corresponded to the aesthetic taste of the nineteenth century; his enormous success at Universal Expositions; his role compared with English and French counterparts; as well as the path his romantic artwork took towards modernism. Manuel Cipriano Gomes (1831-1905), born in a village near Mafra, the name of which he adopted, was a potter who in 1850 settled in Caldas da Rainha, a well known ceramics centre. In the second half of the nineteenth century, he is credited with revolutionising the type of ceramics produced in the small town by breaking with local pottery tradition and introducing European aesthetic revivalist influences: from Italy, Delia Robbia, with high-relief motifs using fruits and foliage forming a wreath, or as a central theme; and particularly from France, the Renaissance master Bernard Palissy,2 who produced his designs by attaching casts of lizards, snakes and shellfish to traditional ceramic forms such as basins, ewers and plates. Mafra embedded this type of ceramic and aesthetic into the decorative arts appreciated in Europe at the time (figs 1 and 2). Neo-Palissy-style ceramics emerge as a clear and broad expression of the historicism influencing nineteenth-century Europe and were driven by the rehabilitation of Palissy's work around 1830. This followed the discovery of the legendary rustic 'grotto' commissioned by Catherine de' Medici on the site of the present-day Jardins des Tuileries in Paris. The ceramics and fragments found were added to museum collections and contributed to the resurgence of appreciation for I Ewer, cover and stand, with lizards, insects and frogs, applied on a mossy ground.

These followers of the Palissy style trained disciples, and the revivalist trend rapidly reached England when Herbert Minton (1793-1858) engaged a young French ceramic artist, Leon Arnoux (1816-1902), as art director in 1849. Meanwhile, the style put down roots in Portugal with the work of Manuel Mafra. Between 1850 and 1905, Mafra created by hand an amazing amount of wares in his workshop, without modern machinery or steam power. This included both simple and rustic objects of popular appeal, and the most stylish work, which attracted those of cultured and romantic tastes. The latter was produced from the 1870s, when he had most contact with his patron, Prince Consort Fernando of Saxe-Coburg Gotha (1816-1885). Initially, Manuel Mafra's production comprised mainly objects corresponding to local tradition, such as bottles in the shape of women, toothpick holders, whistles, candlesticks in the shape of animals such as monkeys, lions and dogs, plus a vast number of doll-like popular figures doubling as toothpick holders and candlesticks - an anthropomorphic and zoomorphic reinterpretation realised in rich polychrome. He modelled numerous objects inspired by ceramics from France and England, mainly Staffordshire potteries such as Minton and Spode (Copeland), as well as models by the Wood Family and Thomas Wheildon, which had reached the Portuguese market from the second half of the eighteenth century. These utilitarian ceramic objects in the shape of animals, fruits or human figures were reproduced by several Portuguese factories and sold throughout the country. Examples include anthropomorphic mugs and wine jugs, plates and oval dishes formed by simple or ornamentally overlaid leaves and inspired by English originals successfully produced in quantity in the Wedgwood and other Staffordshire factories, by Sarreguemines in France and by the Griffen, Smith &amp;c Hill Company in the USA. Mafra's preference for motifs from nature can be seen in the very structure of the objects, such as the ewer in the shape of a snake, the bulls that serve as wine vessels, the teapot in the shape of a monkey (fig. 3), the box in the caricature form of a woman with the head of a chicken from the Ariana 3 Teapot in the form of a monkey wearing a tricorn hat, with serpent forming the handle and spout.

These objects revealed a natural sense of humour (which Bordalo Pinheiro later develops with masterly skill) and were very attractive, since their functionality was expressed through unusual shapes. Inspiration from nature is also present in the use of various elements from flora and fauna, namely foliage, flowers and small animals moulded and applied onto the surface of the most diverse objects, such as boxes and ewers, which achieved vibrant and intense colours through the use of metallic oxides over clear glazes. Of note are ewers and teapots usually produced from metal moulds and decorated with small game such as pheasants, partridge and rabbits in relief and with a greyhound forming the handle; as well as tureens in the shape of a fish (fig. 5), also decorated with small animals in relief, and oval dishes (fig. 6). Many of these objects are of oriental inspiration, found in wares imported by the East India Company. The skill of the ceramicist, the attractive, carefully modelled pieces and the good application of glazes caught the attention of an illustrious and noble clientele, including Prince Consort Fernando of Saxe-Coburg Gotha.4 Married to Queen Maria II (1819-1853), he had an influential role in Portuguese heritage and was patron of various artistic and industrial activities. During his sojourns in Caldas, a place of choice for the elite and the royal family, he commissioned Mafra to produce numerous wares, mainly to decorate the palaces Necessidades and Pena in Sintra. This regard earned Mafra the privilege of the title 'Supplier to the Royal House'5 from 1870, granted by royal charter - a prestigious honorary title much sought after by all the traders of the country. Initially Mafra marked his work6 with a monogram, initials or these inserted inside an anchor, but then he started to identify his objects with MAFRA/ CALDAS/PORTUGAL, topped by the royal crown. Soon Manuel Mafra's production evolved considerably - because of his ability and technical skill, his contact with foreign artists and the work afforded him by Fernando II. The Prince owned a considerable collection of artistic ceramic objects, acquired from his close contacts with the greatest Portuguese collectors, such as Jose Palha, but mostly of foreign origin from the likes of Francis Cook and John Robinson.7 (Sir Francis Cook [1817-1901] was a British merchant and art collector and Sir John Robinson [1824-1913] a connoisseur and collector.) Fernando II introduced Mafra to many of the works in his collections, such as Italian majolica and works in the Palissy style, and through his influence and support guided him on the route to internationalisation. 4 jug in the form of a lizard dressed as a monk.

They re-launched the decorative arts, giving high visibility to ceramics and to the spread of neo-Palissy aesthetics. The inaugural 1851 Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations,8 was 'marked by a taste for exuberance, energy and breadth',9 and revealed a wide variety of neo-Palissy objects by Minton and the French ceramicists Joseph Landais and Charles-Jean Avisseau, who won a medal10 for their decorative glazed faience. This style of ceramics continued to obtain great successes in the ensuing international exhibitions. The ceramics of Caldas da Rainha had their international debut at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1867, showcasing the work of Manuel Mafra, thanks to the intervention and incentive of Prince Fernando. This gave Mafra exposure and put him in contact with European culture and art. The extraordinary mastery of his craft, the production of ever more refined work and the royal patronage guaranteed his presence at future international exhibitions, including in London (1871), Vienna (1873), Philadelphia (1876), again in Paris (1878) and Brazil (1879), where he gained success and relevant awards. He drew the attention of buyers and collectors alike to his work, which rapidly became part of royal and museum collections, such as the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London and the Ariana Museum in Geneva. Fourteen of Manuel Mafra's works are part of the latter Museum's collections and were donated by the Swiss collector Gustave Revilliod (1817-1890).11 It is thought that he bought these pieces from Mafra at the Vienna exhibition of 1873. Four beautiful objects by Mafra belonging to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum12 were acquired at the time of the London exhibition in 1871, 'given by The Royal Commissioners for the 1851 Great Exhibition', to be included in the collections of the predecessor of the V&amp;A, the South Kensington Museum.13 One of them is a plate with overlapping vine leaves, a green glaze and two small manganese-glazed bunches of grapes in the centre,14 marked with the first commercial stamp used by Manuel Mafra (M. 7 Tobacco Jar, with small moulded animals applied on the body and cover.

Another piece, a tobacco jar with lid (fig. 7)15 in traditional shape enamelled in shades of brown, green and cream under a clear glaze, with escorridos ('dripping' paint effects) and small moulded animals (lizards, shellfish, beetles) applied on the body and on the cover, already reflects Palissy's influence. A vase16 with intricate formal characteristics, elongated neck above globular body, the handles in the form of serpents, and lizards, frogs, shells and strawberry flowers applied over a brown glazed body already reveals some sense of an emerging modernism in its balance between form and ornament. The V&amp;A plate (fig. 8)17 is clearly inspired by Palissy. Its interior depicts a dramatic scene in which a predator and its victims, a snake and two lizards in relief, play out a theatre of life, death and transformation. The centre is filled with the famous 'musgado' (moss), a technique developed by Manuel Mafra to create the feel of Palissy's aquatic scenes. Palissy's magical world and his ornamental vocabulary are extensively used and recreated by Mafra in a huge 8 Plate in Palissy style, with reptiles in an aggressive fight. M.

His compositions combine romanticism and naturalism, the imaginary and the real, where nature is both luxuriant and implacable. Predatory scenes - lizards threatening snakes, snakes that devour birds and animals, which attack the nests of other animals - represent a dramatic and zoomorphic world that is common in the bestiaries of Mafra, Avisseau and other contemporary artists. Their realistic and dramatic interpretations of nature contain a powerful symbolism linked to the myths of the underworld and reinterpreting Palissy's concepts. In his written work Discours Admirables (1580) the Renaissance master refers to the earth and its alchemy, and to the perpetual transmutation of the world of nature, 'which is always in a permanent state of flux and tumult', reiterating the belief in 'nature in a state of perpetual transformation' described by Leonardo da Vinci.18 Mafra's work is in a tradition of revealing the world of nature through its interpretation in art. The ceramicist translated the romantic idea of a dramatic and voluptuous nature, where the elements represented belong to the local flora and fauna but are simultaneously shown in a stylised and fictional way. Such is the case of a butterfly larva, where he merges in one single image the various stages of its complete metamorphosis. Some of the reptiles he dramatically depicts are recreations of tropical fauna, examples of which he had access to through book illustrations. Although showing this marked preference for a neo-Palissy style, Mafra used other aesthetic currents, such as the Renaissance, and more sophisticated decorations, such as acanthus leaves, bay leaf wreaths, bows, garlands of flowers, cameos, putti and volutes to create the handles of vases, and heraldic crests. The 'Minerva' vase,19 commissioned by Prince Fernando is an example.20 The globular body bears on the front the Portuguese royal coat of arms and on the other side the goddess Minerva flanked by foliage.

Photograph Margarida Araujo. Inspired by a Copeland (Spode) model, seen here on the cover of a Christie's London sale catalogue. Mafra's eclectic style sometimes tends towards the exotic, evident in the use of legendary animals such as griffins and dragons, usually forming the handles of pieces (fig. 9). These are later reinterpreted, and their dimensions enhanced, in the work of Bordalo Pinheiro. Prominent within this aesthetic are works such as the mythological sculpture The Death of Adonis, a neoclassical work of art in the manner of sculpture groups produced in Italy, or the large inkpot (or jewel case) in the collection of the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, which combines neo-rococco and traditional styles. It is obvious that Mafra had access to European revivalist ceramics through catalogues and illustrations as well as the objects themselves. An example of this is the sculpture group of an ape riding on the back of a tortoise, 'Macaco e Tartaruga' (Sloth and Mischief), a copy of a Copeland majolica figure group produced from a model by the French artist Louis-Auguste Malempre (1825-1925) in Stoke-on Trent in 1770 (fig. 10).21 Manuel Mafra's iconographical sources go beyond Italian and French Renaissance models to take inspiration also from sixteenth-century German arts. An example of one such is a hare22 in glazed earthenware with its surface beautifully imitating the animal's fur, a copy of the celebrated watercolour by Albrecht Diirer (1471-1528).23 Into the ceramics activity of Caldas da Rainha Mafra introduced objects of large dimensions, such as urns, vessels and pots with naturalistic decorations (fig. 11), which</page><page sequence="11">62 THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2013 I I Large pot, with naturalistic decoration. Manuel Mafra. Private Collection Duarte Pinto Coelho. Bordalo Pinheiro later develops further, challenging the capabilities of the ceramic materials. One example is the jar to Beethoven, 280 cm high. Its decoration evokes Beethoven with the first notes of the score of his Quartet, opus 18, no. 4 played by four performers applied on the round part of the object, an eagle on the bust of the musician, and enveloped in foliage and floral motifs.24 Manuel Mafra's workshop experienced almost four decades of intense activity and productivity, achieving fame and significant financial reward, both at home and abroad. However, in the 1880s his activity began to decline due to his advanced age, and the death of his patron, Prince Fernando, in addition to other factors, mainly the strong competition from the Fabrica de Faiangas from 1884 described below, as well as a profound change in the Portuguese cultural scene. A new Portuguese aesthetic emerges in the 1880s linked to international trends and as a result of the Arts and Crafts Movement, which valued the artisan and popular arts, thus contributing to a line of thought that contested a revivalist aesthetic in favour of a modernism. In Portugal these trends prompted intellectuals to reappraise the traditional arts within the scope of national values. This new line of thought was to have an impact on industrial products that then assumed an aesthetic language rooted in regional and national traditions. Caldas da Rainha's artistic ceramic potential caught the attention of a summer resident of Caldas, Feliciano Bordalo Pinheiro, who in 1883 started partnerships with investors towards a project for industrial ceramic production. The Fabrica de Faian^as of Caldas da Rainha was founded in 1884, designed to develop, innovate and implement the intended new aesthetic paradigm for decorative industrial arts, with Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro as its artistic director (fig. 12). The factory was furnished with modern machinery selected by Bordalo Pinheiro who, together with his brother, Feliciano Bordalo, travelled to the main European ceramics centres in France, Belgium and England. Bordalo wrote to a friend describing his travels, especially his stay in England, where he visited the main factories: 'Here I am, at the largest industrial centre in England .... This county of Staffordshire is the most important for our business; it is here that the main factories are located ... we have seen the best there is in England - the county of Staffordshire, where we stayed - is the main place for factories, not only in England but in the rest of the world ... we have visited the famous Wedgwood factory'. Talented, with a curious and observant mind, Bordalo Pinheiro had grasped the best that was being produced in those centres. I I Large pot, with naturalistic decoration. Manuel Mafra. Private Collection Duarte Pinto Coelho. i</page><page sequence="12">PORTUGUESE CERAMICIST MANUEL MAFRA 63 With the objective of switching to industrial activity, the best machinery available at the time was chosen for the Caldas factory. Bordalo travelled abroad to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, such as an electric engine built by the famous Paul Faure of Limoges, a steam-boiler manufactured by Messrs Hartley and Arnoux's factory and several kilns of the system used by the Minton factory.25 A contract with Minton included the engagement of one of their technicians to come over to Portugal to mount the equipment and instruct Bordalo's staff on its use. This marked the transition from artisan-produced to industrial ceramics in Caldas da Rainha. Bordalo brought to Portugal not only modern equipment but also the ideology of movements such as the Arts and Crafts, especially its awareness of the importance of design, the requirement of specialised training of staff and concerns of a social nature - all of which he implemented at the factory. We cannot forget the importance of Caldas da Rainha, famous for its spas, as a preferred place for the royal family, the court and the most illustrious national and foreign visitors, eager to buy ceramic objects appreciated for their artistic appeal. One such was Lady Charlotte Guest,26 a collector of porcelain who visited Caldas da Rainha in 1884. In her diary she mentioned the 'small town' and the production of local wares, similar to Palissy wares.27 Caldas's wares, manufactured at small family-type workshops and still influenced by Palissy style, were extremely attractive and widely exported to countries such as England, Brazil and the USA. This was the main inspiration for Bordalo Pinheiro, who was determined to perfect 12 Fabrica das Faiangas das Caldas da Rainha, 1887. Photograph, Private Collection.</page><page sequence="13">64 THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2013 and innovate industrial modelling using advanced techniques for the preparation and application of enamels. As he described in the factory report of 1886: 'The moulds are brand new but, nonetheless, they maintain the main character of the old artistic wares. The glazes have been carefully studied, achieving some magnificent and new colours that inspired most admiration amongst lovers of ceramics arts.' And the report highlights the concern with 'preserving the character' that always differentiated these wares, similar to those of Palissy, but using aesthetic models that define the Portuguese sensitivity: 'The original and singular types of wares of our provinces will be especially followed, studied and decorated throughout this production'.28 The attempt to manufacture everyday wares similar to English ones and decorated with impressed Portuguese motifs did not achieve commercial success, contrary to expectations. However, the production of decorative ceramics enjoyed great success, which continues up to the present, and was attributed to Bordalo's artistic genius and his unlimited creativity. Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro was born into an educated family of artists. He was the son of the romantic artist Manuel Maria Bordalo Pinheiro (1815-1880) and brother of the famous painter Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro (1857-1929) and was a major figure in Portuguese culture at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. At the age of 38, at the peak of his success as a caricaturist, journalist and illustrator, during which he collaborated with foreign newspapers such as the Illustrated London News and several Spanish periodicals, he accepted the challenge of becoming artistic director of the Fabrica de Faian^as. He developed an enormous amount of highly creative ceramic work that found a 13 Naturalistic flower pot, with a gurnard fish and moss. Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro, 1896.

It was, however, the naturalism of his work that received the highest public recognition. Inquisitive, an observer enraptured by nature, Rafael's ceramics mirror his sensory experiences to reproduce vegetation, fauna and reflections of water (fig. 13). The decoration of numerous and varied objects includes a series of motifs of flowers, fruits, leaves and branches harmoniously arranged; and fish, crustaceans, reptiles, lizards, frogs and insects modelled with spontaneity and movement. Some inspiration was taken from everyday rural life, from baskets used in grape gathering and flatter baskets used to carry agricultural produce such as plaits of onions and garlic (fig. 14). Bordalo was inspired by the work of Manuel Mafra and of the followers of Palissy in other countries, especially Joseph Landais and Thomas Sergent, but he models with more sophistication. Examples are the 'Gaio' plate of 1901 and two large vases with a jay and a hoopoe of 1900, now in the collections of Museu da Ceramica, Caldas da Rainha. The former has many similarities to the plate of Landais where birds attack a butterfly, now in the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Tours;29 however, Bordalo models the birds with an elegant and suave expression and the insects mingle amid the delicate spears of wheat and branches of olive trees (fig. 15). This naturalist's vision of lightness and grace reflects the influence of Japonisme, widely spread by artists and designers of the period such as Christopher Dresser (1834-1904). Bordalo's motifs of flora and fauna are scientifically modelled so that the species can be identified, as opposed to those largely fantastical interpretations imagined by Manuel Mafra. The romantic and dramatic nature of Mafra's creations gives way to something more real, embellished and unmistakably nationalist.</page><page sequence="15">66 16 Drawings made by Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro for a serving set. Private Collection, Caldas da Rainha. Using his background and training as an illustrator, Bordalo approached his ceramic art through the perspective of drawing, aligned with the currents of his time that championed the supremacy of design in works of art and craft. Various drawings of his objects giving rigorous instructions for their production are testimony to his pioneering role as a designer of Portuguese ceramics (fig. 16). The humour evident in his ceramics was one of the strongest indications of Bordalo Pinheiro's naturalism and realism. His teapots, cups and pitchers, among others, satirise people and situations and make Bordalo's work a document of Portuguese political and social life. He finds inspiration in numerous objects by Mafra, such as anthropomorphic bottles, on which he confers a critical sense and social and political intent, transforming them into caricatures. Other aspects he has in common with Mafra are the use of the wicker technique, or that of netting, such as the very large and remarkable plate dated 1892, with robust fish entangled in a fishing net on a background of escorridos, suggesting the transparency of the sea (fig. 17). Mafra's original also had fish entangled in a net, but was more exuberant and naturalistic. The fact that some of Mafra's employees went to work at the Fabrica de Faian^as, where they introduced models and techniques, certainly contributed to this continuity. The naturalistic style - with strong popular roots - is a significant part of the work of Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro but other characteristics are also relevant, such as a far ranging historicism. This can be seen in objects with neo-Renaissance decorations of Italian influence, profusely decorated with revivalist and exotic motifs such as mythological and allegorical subjects, shells, volutes, rosettes and garlands. An example is the 'Renaissance' centrepiece with a medallion with the monogram of its commissioner surrounded by mythological figures - mermaids and satyrs amid shells and floral motifs, crowned with putti. The heads of two dragons form the handles (fig. 18).</page><page sequence="16">PORTUGUESE CERAMICIST MANUEL MAFRA 67 17 'Camacho' plate. Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro, signed, 1892.

Monumental works - marvels of creative fantasy - stand out, such as the 'Manueline' pitcher, 240 cm high, decorated with lace, ropes, shields and caravels, entwined with algae, and incorporating nationalist elements such as royal arms, the Portuguese coat of arms and the figures of Henry the Navigator and Luis de Camoes in low relief. Bordalo Pinheiro exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1889, where he was awarded a gold and silver medal and the Legion d'Honneur, and again at that of 1900. At this time he came into contact with the Art Nouveau style, from which he took inspiration for works such as the oval dragonfly fruit bowl, decorated with white daisies and large dragonflies with long and sinuous wings (Museu da Ceramica 454) and especially for his tiles depicting butterflies and grasshoppers on winding ears of corn. He was able to adapt this style to Portuguese taste, for example, in the vase 'Dan^a das Ras', a traditional shape decorated with a frieze of frogs, full of rhythm and movement (fig. 19). In the last period of his production, marked by the financial crisis of the factory (1891), and with the important collaboration of his son, Manuel Gustavo Bordalo Pinheiro, his work became more streamlined and restrained in the use of decorative motifs. While maintaining his taste for emphasising the decoration, he now placed more value on the overall design, adjusting the ornamentation to the precision of the shape, then enriching it with metal oxides or beautiful escorridos. In this way he comes closer to modernism and to the philosophy of designers and reformers such as Theodore Deck (1823-1891), Henry Cole (1808-1882)30 and Christopher Dresser. A strong Japonisme influence definitely shifts his productions away from a romantic style (fig. 20). After the death of Bordalo in 1905, his son maintained a continuity of his work in the new factory that he founded in 1908, redeveloping its production towards more simplified decoration. 19 Vase 'Dan?a das Ras'.

Manuel Mafra was faithful to romanticism and to the educated choices of his patron's taste and Bordalo, although not breaking entirely free from romanticism, follows a naturalism and harmonises national tradition with the picturesque. Manuel Mafra and Bordalo Pinheiro came from very different social backgrounds. The ceramics of the potter Mafra developed in a discreet and persevering manner thanks to his determination and talent. Bordalo Pinheiro, born into a family of artists in a cosmopolitan environment, was known both in Portugal and abroad. He took advantage of a new ambience, greater openness of the country to the outside, his travels and contacts, and especially of the promotional opportunities afforded by the press, in which he gained valuable exposure. The rise of a more sophisticated expertise in art criticism, while almost nonexistent in Mafra's active life so that he had scant public visibility, was more advanced at a later date and Bordalo was able to reap its benefits. More than an aesthetic shift, Bordalo's work marks the birth of a fresh paradigm, that of a multifaceted artist, developing his art in increasingly disparate styles. Imbued with a modernising spirit in decorative arts, without belittling traditional arts and crafts, Bordalo contributed to a narrowing of the distinction between fine arts and applied arts. He devoted himself to a variety of artistic expressions, from illustrative graphic work for various purposes to jewellery design, elite domestic interiors, theatrical decorations, as well as involvement in the ornamentation of several pavilions in the international exhibitions of the time. Manuel Mafra and Bordalo were faithful to traditional Portuguese pottery shapes, mastering their texture, colours and glazes. However, the production of a 'fantasy ware' at Bordalo's factory diverged from the traditional through the large and bold dimensions of the objects and the treatment of their shape, usually elaborate, which served as a basis for the exuberant decorations. Manuel Mafra died on 12 December 1905. Fifteen years older, he survived Bordalo Pinheiro, who died at the age of 59 on 23 February 1905, by less than one year. Unlike Bordalo's son, much to Mafra's regret his own son did not continue his father's work, preferring instead to become a candidate for local political office. The extraordinary work produced by Mafra at the end of his artistic career, marked by a romanticism already detached from the European scene, though given continuity by his followers for a short while, remained in a long aesthetic exile very similar to that endured by Palissy. Art researchers and museums in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries rediscovered Mafra's work, and the publication of a book and mounting of an exhibition attracting historians and collectors from all over the world restored it to its rightful place in history.31</page><page sequence="20">PORTUGUESE CERAMICIST MANUEL MAFRA 71 Notes 1 Caldas da Rainha was founded in the fifteenth century by Queen Leonor of Lancaster (1458-1525), married to King D.Joao II, who came across an old roman spa, believed to have therapeutic benefits to health. In 1488 she ordered the building of a hospital for people using the spa waters.The result of a royal initiative, this spa was regularly frequented by royalty and was considered a centre of excellence for arts and culture and to be of a distinguished ceramics tradition. 2 Bernard Palissy (15 10 -1590).
