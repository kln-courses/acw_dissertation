<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEOPOLD LOW AND THE STUDY OF RABBINIC JUDAISM - A BICENTENNIAL APPRAISAL Sinai (Tamas) Turan Pre-WWII European Jewish scholarship is becoming an Atlantis - only some pinnacles of it are still visible to the eye. The languages in which the bulk of this scholarship was written - first and foremost German, "the most important of all dead languages," as some say today in Israel and America - make it less and less accessible. Leopold Low (1811-1875) belongs to this sinking continent, and he is already below the water line. In academic circles his son Immanuel Low (1854—1944) is better known than himself, on account of his own rock solid contributions to Semitic philology and folklore. "The deeds (and writings) of the fathers are a sign for the children" - indeed there is much in common in the careers and scholarship of this father and son.1 Their biographies combined would pertain not only to a good part of the intellectual history of the Jews of modern Hungary, but to a good part of the general history of Hungarian Jewry as well.2 A book-length intellectual biography of I use below the following abbreviations: WdJ = Wissenschaft des Judentums (the academic study of Judaism); GS = Leopold Low, Gesammelte Schriften (ed.

The bicentennial of his birth offers here an opportunity for the more limited task of removing some of the dust covering his research on rabbinic literature. A contemporary of Zacharias Frankel (1801-1875) and Abraham Geiger (1810-1874), Low was an important representative of European Jewish scholarship from the second third of the nineteenth century. He became the first champion - and in a way, the founder - of its Hungarian branch and brand, during a period when the Hungarian Jewish population grew (mostly through immigration from Galicia) from less than quarter of a million to more than half a million people. Within the broader dynamics of the Haskalah, two major patterns of scholarship and two types of scholars emerged in the first half of the nineteenth century, mostly in Central Europe - in Germanic lands, in Northern Italy and in the Habsburg Empire. The first pattern was characterized by (1) openness to religious reform and the advocacy of religious, as opposed to "national," Jewish identities; (2) a heavy presence on the scholarly agenda of issues related to the public discourse about and struggles surrounding emancipation; and (3) publication, for the most part, in languages other than Hebrew. The second pattern or group had more "conservative" religious leanings and stronger national loyalties, an academic agenda more detached from the political agenda, and a preference for publishing in Hebrew. The first pattern is commonly called the Wissenschaft des Judentums (the academic study of Judaism). It flourished in Germanic lands, and Leopold Zunz (Detmold, 1794-Berlin, 1886) was a characteristic representative. The second pattern may be called Hokhmath Yisrael·, it held sway in the Eastern parts of the Habsburg Empire (especially Galicia), and Shlomo Judah Rappoport (Lemberg, 1790-Prague, 1867) was a characteristic exemplar.3 This is not a to 1885 (Szeged: Szegedi Zsido Hitkozseg, 1885), 172-255 (in Hungarian); as well as the edition of his selected opera minora (GS) and his bibliography (GS 5:1-19). An updated bibliography of Leopold Low is a desideratum; items are missing even beyond what is indicated in the final remarks on the existing bibliography (GS 5:19. Among the missing works are anonymous editorials and articles printed in the BCh itself; see nn. 59 and 105 below, for example. Cf. Moshe Pelli, Kerem Hemed: "Hochmat Israel" as the "New Yavneh An Annotated Index to Kerem Hemed, the Hebrew Journal of the Haskalah in Galicia and Italy (1833 [42*]</page><page sequence="3">Sinai (Tamas) Turan rigid dichotomy, of course, and specific scholars fit these patterns to different degrees, or may be located somewhere in between. In what follows I will use the term Wissenschaft des Judentums [ WdJj as a general designation for nineteenth- and twentieth-century Jewish academic scholarship. Low was a typical representative of the first pattern, to which he brought local color and his own individual stamp. Born in Moravia, he completed a thorough yeshiva education and received rabbinic ordination from an interesting array of rabbis.4 With ordination behind him, he became an advocate of moderate religious reform. Since he did not see any chance to obtain a rabbinic position in his home country (due to his "maskilic" proclivities and openness to reform), he migrated to neighboring Hungary, where more liberal trends in general politics, as well as the greater number of larger Jewish urban communities, gave him more opportunity and freedom to act.5 Between 1835 and 1841 he studied classical languages, sciences, history, philosophy, etc., at the University of Pest, in the Lutheran Lyceum of Pressburg, and in Vienna.6 1866) (Jerusalem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 2009), 118-24 (in Hebrew). The earliest - albeit rudimentary - mention of this distinction that I am aware of is by Solomon Schechter, who categorizes major scholars of WdJ as being of the "East" and of the "West": "The Beginnings of Jewish 'Wissenschaft,'" The Jewish Review 1 (1910-1911): 307; repr. in Seminary Addresses and Other Papers (Cincinnati: Ark, 1915), 187. Joachim Deutschmann (Gewitsch, Trebitsch, Kolin [Moravia and Bohemia; today in the Czech Republic]); Shlomo Judah Rappoport (Prague); Loeb Schwab (Gewitsch, Prossnitz, Pest; Low's future father-in-law); Aaron Chorin (Arad [Transylvania, today in Rumania]). See Fiilop Griinvald, "Letters to Leopold Low and on Leopold Low,יי in Semitic Studies in Memory of ImmanuelLow (ed. A. Scheiber; Budapest: [s.n.], 1947), 98 (in Hungarian; the relevant letter - from Low to Moritz Feitel - is in German). For background on Low's decision to leave Moravia (in 1835), see his account of the years when Nehemiah Trebitsch served as chief rabbi of Moravia (1832^2). Trebitsch strongly opposed - and until 1838 had powers to prevent - the appointment of candidates with "maskilic" leanings to rabbinic positions: "Das mahrische Landesrabbinat seit hundert Jahren," GS 2:199-212. At the time when he wrote his first published article (supposedly in 1837 or the year before; see below n. 24 and n. 54), Low was in all likelihood a student at the University of Pest. (Pest later became part of Budapest.) His main field of study was classics (esp. Greek) with Ludwig Schedius, who had also been the professor of Zacharias Frankel at the same university in the late twenties. To date no further details are known about [43*]</page><page sequence="4">Leopold Low and the Study of Rabbinic Judaism a Bicentennial Appraisal Later he filled rabbinic positions in various towns in Hungary, and finally (in 1850) settled in Szeged (the second largest city in the country), where he was rabbi of the Neolog community for the rest of his life.7 His scholarly works were published in German, with only a few exceptions. Low's role in the political and religious struggles in Hungary and his attitude to religious reform (and the shifts in that attitude) are beyond the scope of this paper.8 The rather meager literature on Low (a good part of which the studies of Low and Frankel during these formative years in Pest. For Frankel, see Andreas Bramer, Zacharias Frankel: Wissenschaft des Judentums und konservative Reform im 19. Jahrhundert (Hildesheim and New York: Olms, 2000), 40. The registers of the University of Pest for these years have apparently perished. Although the denominational term "Neolog" is of later origin (from the end of the 1860s), the religious attitude (ideology and practice) that it denotes evolved over the several prior decades in Ffungary. This attitude may be described as a sort of "moderate reform." "Moderate" is, of course, a relative term, and "reform" is context-bound; as illustrated by a commemorative editorial article about Low in a Jewish periodical in New York, which states: "Loew was a leader of 'modern reform' - here in the United States he would have been called 'an orthodox rabbi' [...]." (The Hebrew Standard 58/11 [13 October 1911]: 1-2). In any case, as regards normative religious behavior, the Neolog version of reform was meant to accommodate, to some degree, the emerging Jewish urban middle class (in its Flungarian social setting) in relation to secular culture and the non-Jewish environment (in terms of education, language, manners, dress, aesthetic elements of synagogue architecture, liturgy, burial customs; etc.), and by adopting liberal attitudes in other areas of law and custom. It did not, however, advocate radical measures such as the abolition of circumcision or parts of Sabbath and kashrut laws; changing basic marital laws; revising and censoring traditional prayers, etc. (as occurred in some Reform circles in German lands and elsewhere). For a brief account of the emergence of the Neolog platform, and Low's role in forming it, see Jacob Katz, A House Divided: Orthodoxy and Schism in Nineteenth-Century Central European Jewry (tr. Ziporah Brody; Hanover University Press of New England, 1998), 40-43,45^46. In his introduction to Aaron Chorin's book in 1839, he distinguishes between three approaches within contemporary Judaism: "rabbinic," "historic," and "accommodationist" ("Die Reform des rabbinischen Ritus auf rabbinischem Standpunkte," GS 1:15-29). Low polemicizes against the first and the last approaches; later he explicitly identifies himself with the "historical school": "Die Orthodoxie und das Rabbiner-Seminar" (1864), GS 4:451; "Die Almemorfrage (Nachtrag)" (1865), GS 4:107; "Jiidische Dogmen" (1871), GS 1:163. This nomenclature - more or less applicable still today, especially in Diaspora Jewry - may be one of the first attempts to characterize the major ideological platforms which emerged in nineteenth century European Judaism. (From the late 1850s Low refers to modernist orthodoxy [44*]</page><page sequence="5">Sinai (Tamas) Turan is in Hungarian), focuses on these aspects of his career and deals with his biography, while his scholarship is almost entirely neglected.9 I. Disciplines, Nomenclature, Research Plans Low pioneered in several fields in Jewish scholarship, as we will try to show below. Since current nomenclature differs from nineteenth-century German nomenclature, it may be helpful first to highlight Low's own terminology in his studies on ancient and later rabbinic Judaism. [represented by S. R. Hirsch and his followers] as "neuorthodoxe deutsche Romantik" [GS 1:131, 329; cf. "neuorthodoxe Romantiker" in GS 1:249]). One of his few articles in Hebrew - an outline of his historical approach to halakhah - uses instead, however, the dichotomy of "progressives" and "conservatives" (the Hebrew equivalents of which - neologisms, in both senses of the term - appear already in the essay's title: "המהלכים והעומדים", He-Halutz 3 [1856]: 161-76); the same terminology appears in another article penned by him (see Appendix). The trichotomous terminology reflects the German scene, the dichotomous one reflects the emerging Hungarian scene, with the growing presence and influence there of strongly traditionalist Jews mostly of Galician origin. For the majority of them (and of other similarly traditionalist segments of the Hungarian Jewish population), there was not much difference between radical and moderate reform (or even between these and modernist orthodoxy; cf. Max Wiener, Jiidische Religion im Zeitalter der Emanzipation [Berlin: Philo Verlag, 1933], 8). Working in the latter, more dichotomous scene, Low positioned himself politically with the progressives. There is a book-length monograph on Low that was published in his lifetime: Abraham Hochmuth, Leopold Low als Theologe, Historiker und Publizist (Leipzig: Brockhaus, 1871). Despite its ambitious title, the book is little more than a polemic against Low's public activities and his works on the "Jewish Congress" in Hungary (1868-1869), and is therefore largely irrelevant to our subject here. I refer only to more recent literature on Low (in English and German): Michael K. Silber, "Low, Leopold," YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe (ed. Gershon David Hundert; 2 vols.; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008), 1:1090-92; Carsten Wilke, Die Rabbiner der Emanzipationszeit in den deutschen, bohmischen und grofipolnischen Landern, 1781 1871 (vol. 2 of Biographisches Handbuch der Rabbiner, Teil /; ed. Julius Carlebach and Michael Brocke; Munich: Saur, 2004), 618-21. For the Moravian background, see Michael L. Miller, Rabbis and Revolution: The Jews of Moravia in the Age of Emancipation (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2011). For a succinct appraisal of Low's two chief works, see Ismar Schorsch, From Text to Context: The Turn to History in Modern Judaism (Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England, 1994), 327. ף 45]</page><page sequence="6">Leopold Low and the Study of Rabbinic Judaism a Bicentennial Appraisal 1. Talmudic Antiquities/Archaeology Low frequently designates the field of scholarship he cultivates as "the study of (Jewish/rabbinic/Talmudic) antiquities" (A Iterthumskunde).10 The term is adopted from the founding fathers of WdJ, who conceived of WdJ as part of, and parallel to, a general scheme of humanities studies. In his famous programmatic article of 1818, Leopold Zunz had already accorded a place to Alterthumskunde (and Antiquitaten) in the scholarly universe of WdJ.u In 10 This term appears in a section title in all the volumes of his BCh (I am not aware of thematic section divisions elsewhere in Jewish scholarly and semi-scholarly periodicals prior to the BCh). The first five volumes also have a subsection entitled "Contributions to Talmudic Linguistics and Antiquities" ("Beitrage zur talmudischen Sprachforschung und Alterthumskunde"; for the title cf. Michael Sachs's Beitrage zur Sprach- und Alterthumsforschung [Berlin: Veit, 1852-1854]). The term also appears on a routine basis in Low's own articles published there. His two late, major books are part of a planned series titled "Contributions to Jewish Antiquities" ("Beitrage zur jiidischen Alterthumskunde"; see the page opposite the main title page). See also his "Die Pflege der talmudischen Alterthumskunde" (1865), GS 3:5, etc.; and his Graphische Requisiten und Erzeugnissse derJuden (Leipzig: Leiner, 1870-1871; repr: Westmead: Gregg International, 1969), l:v, vii-viii. In one of his few Hebrew articles Low calls this discipline kadmoniyot (168 ,"המהלכים והעומדים"); cf. Isa 43:18. This term served as the Hebrew equivalent for antiquitates/archaeologia in references to Josephus's Jewish Antiquities at least from the time of Azariah de Rossi's Meor Enayim (1573-1575) (ed. David Cassel; Vilna: Romm, 1866), 134,136, etc. (see also Low,174 ,"המהלכים והעומדים", and Kalman Schulman's (partial) Hebrew translation of Josephus's above-mentioned work (Vilna: Romm, 1864); it was used by later authors such as Jacob Reifmann (מועדי ערב [Abendstunden] [Vilna: Fiinn and Rosenkrantz, 1863], [3], 70), and Samuel Krauss (in the Hebrew - unfinished - version of his Talmudische Archaologie: קדמוניות התלמוד [2 parts in 4 vols.; Berlin and Vienna: Herz; Tel-Aviv: Dvir, 1924-1945]). As far as I can ascertain, Low nowhere used the term Alterthumswissenschaft. This term had a more ambitious connotation of comprehensive and synthetic philosophical-historical investigations of (classical) antiquity; see Brian Murdoch and Malcolm K. Reads, eds., Early Germanic Literature and Culture (Rochester, N.Y.: Camden House, 2004), 30. Cf. Ernst F. K. Rosenmiiller, Handbuch der biblischen Alterthumskunde (4 vols; Leipzig: Baumgartner, 1823-1831) l:iv, "Foreword"), who expresses the view that progress in biblical scholarship makes it feasible or desirable to attempt to compile a "Handbuch der biblischen Alterthumswissenschaft." 11 Zunz, "Etwas fiber die rabbinische Literatur," in Gesammelte Schriften (3 vols.; Berlin: Curatorium der "Zunzstiftung," 1875-1876), 1:16. The term Alterthumskunde appeared also in the title of his classic work: Die gottesdienstliche Vortrage derJuden, historisch entwickelt: Ein Beitrag zur Alterthumskunde und biblischen Kritik, zur Literatur- und Religionsgeschichte (Berlin: Asher, 1832). [46*]</page><page sequence="7">Sinai (Tamas) Turan establishing this subject as a discipline of its own (and distinguishing it from "history"), Zunz followed early nineteenth-century classical scholarship - first and foremost Friedrich August Wolf and August Wilhelm Boeckh, his professors at the University of Berlin.12 This discipline, however, has a much longer history. What Low meant by the term Alterthumskunde was similar to what antiquitates/Alterthiimer - antiquities or "archaeology" - meant in earlier centuries: a thematic and systematic presentation of data on various aspects and institutions of the individual and communal life of an ancient society.13 Yet there was a difference On the history of the term Alterthumskunde in classical scholarship, see Arnaldo Momigliano, "Ancient History and the Antiquarian,'י Journal of the Warburg and CourtauldInstitutes 13 (1950): 285-315 (esp. 287-313; repr. in Studies in Historiography [London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1966], 1-39 [esp. 3-27]); Murdoch and Reads, Early Germanic Literature, 30-31. In relation to Zunz, see Luitpold Wallach, Liberty and Letters: The Thoughts of Leopold Zunz (London: East and West Library, 1959), 78-80. For the distinction between history /historiography and antiquities/archaeology, see Momigliano, "Ancient History," 311-12. (It is also worth to note that Wolf explicitly excluded Jewish studies from Alterthumswissenschaft; see Schorsch, From Text to Context, index., s.v.; cf. also Moritz Steinschneider, Allgemeine Einleitung in die jiidische Literatur des Mittelalters [Jerusalem: Bamberger Sc Wahrmann, 1938; originally published in JQR 15-17 (1903-1905)]: 11.) The thematic approach still allows, of course, a chronological and historical treatment within thematic units. Roland de Vaux's Les Institutions de I 'Ancient Testament (2 vols.; Paris: Cerf, 1958-1960; = Israel: Its Life and Institutions [London: Darton, Longman 8c Todd, 1961]) is a late example. At least one early encyclopaedic work of the kind described above, by Johann Jahn, professor in Vienna - Biblische Archaologie (3 parts in 5 volumes; Vienna: Wappler, 1797-1805) - was in Low's possession. (His library, along with that of his son, and most of Leopold Low's literary estate, were donated by the family to the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem; see Alexander Scheiber, "The Fate of the Low Library and Literary Estate," Uj elet 4/32 [5 August 1948]: 14 [in Hungarian]; and idem, "Additions to the Bibliography of Immanuel Low," in Semitic Studies in Memory of Immanuel Low [ed. A. Scheiber; Budapest: Alexander Kohut Memorial Foundation, 1947], 357. Large and important parts of this estate [apparently shipped from Budapest after 1956] did not reach the JNUL, and their current location is unknown.) In the second introduction to Pt. 1, vol. 1, Jahn gives the following definition and classification: "Archaeology, or the study of antiquities ("Alterthumskunde und Alterthumslehre") in general covers all domestic, civic, and sacral curiosities of the ancient world." Accordingly, the three parts of his book are titled "Domestic Antiquities" ("Hausliche Alterthiimer": geography, agriculture, arts, crafts, sciences, commerce, dress and cosmetics, food and eating, women, marriage and [47*]</page><page sequence="8">Leopold Low and the Study of Rabbinic Judaism a Bicentennial Appraisal between Jewish studies and classical studies in this respect. Classical archaeology/antiquities in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries consciously and increasingly used nonliterary sources.14 Archaeological material (in the sense in which we use the term today) for the biblical world, however, was scant before the last third of the nineteenth century, and virtually nonexistent for Judaism in late antiquity (including Talmudic Judaism) for a much longer period. Most books on biblical "archaeology" before that time were based on written sources (first and foremost, the Bible itself), and usually drew no basic distinction between written and nonwritten sources.15 The field Low tried to promote most vigorously he called talmudische Alterthumskunde, as can be seen in his programmatic articles.16 The richness of Talmudic literature in details pertaining to almost all segments of the field or discipline then called "archaeology" promised a partial compensation for the above-mentioned deficiency.17 Biblical or "Hebrew" archaeology - in scope similar to Talmudic archaeology later on - grew gradually into a full-blown discipline of its own by the end of the eighteenth century, in tandem with a growing emphasis in biblical studies generally on the historical-critical method.18 Low,s extension of this divorce, circumcision, naming and education, inheritance, customs and manners, illness, demons, death, burial, mourning); "Political Antiquities" ("Politische Alterthiimer": polity, history, law, warfare); and "Sacral Antiquities" ("Heilige Alterthiimer": Temple and Temple cult, religion). Low cites this work here and there, but it seems that its real influence was felt on the planning of his works - see below, nn. 18 and 98. Momigliano, "Ancient History," 293-307. Rosenmiiller (Handbuch der biblischen Alterthumskunde, vol. 1, "Introduction," 3) gives the following definition: "The term 'study of antiquities' (Alterthumskunde) denotes knowledge of conditions of countries and peoples in the distant past, as yielded by the study of all sorts of ancient monuments (Denkmaler)." "Die Pflege"; see also his introductory statement to the Forschungen des wissenschaftlich-talmudischen Vereins: Beilage zu Ben Chananja [9], Nr. 2 (Jan. 10, 1866). For a survey of the history of Jewish archaeology in general, and Talmudic archaeology in particular, see "Die Pflege," 3-6. Literature remains the main - and frequently the only - type of available source material in many areas of Talmudic archaeology, especially in the Babylonian realm. See Gottlob Wilhelm Meyer, Versuch einer Hermeneutik des Alien Testaments (2 vols.; Lubeck: Bohn, 1799-1800), 2:17-129, for a critical survey of works of this sort from seventeenth-century antecedents until the writer's times. A threefold division of the [48*]</page><page sequence="9">Sinai (Tamas) Turan discipline into the Talmudic period, some sixty years later, was innovative. His purpose was to explore, using a historical-critical methodology, the relatively stable circumstances or conditions of life (including languages, geography, realia, etc.) of Talmudic times - as opposed to the conceptual framework of "history" in general, which focuses on events and processes.19 His call in 1865 for the establishment of a "Talmudic-scientific society,יי to lay the groundwork for a "comprehensive work on Talmudic antiquity according to a collectively developed plan"20 was received with enthusiasm, and in the next two years his Ben Chananja published a supplement (Beilage) - commissioned by the newly established society - devoted to "Talmudic archaeology."21 material into religious, political, and domestic/economic spheres had been common since Conrad Iken's Antiquitates hebraicae (Brema: Jaeger, 1732). These parts (antiquitates publicae-privatae-sacrae) form already the basic structure of Flavio Biondo's (1392-1463) Rome Triumphant (De Roma triumphante; finished 1459; 1st ed. Basel, 1531); see Momigliano, "Ancient History,289-90 יי. In place of the fourth division of Biondo's work (antiquitates militares), a section covering matters of writing, literature and science (literary/scientific/cultural antiquities) was added to this structure in representative works on biblical archaeology from the 1790s. While emphasizing the importance of the historical aspect in the presentation of the material, Meyer also endorses this fourfold division; Versuch, 114—17. The first comprehensive work in the field of antiquities/archaeology by a Jewish scholar was the Archaologie der Hebraer, by Joseph L. Saalschutz (Konigsberg: Borntrager, 1855). The overall task of archaeology, according to Saalschutz, is "to give information on the arrangements of mankind in ancient and the most ancient times" (ix). This book, more modest in scope than many books on biblical/Hebrew archaeology in the eighteenth century (covering realia, religion, ethics, arts, writing and the uses of writing) was among those which gave impetus to Low in planning his works on Talmudic archaeology (cf. Low, "Die Pflege," 4). "Die Pflege," 1; Graphische Requisiten, l:vii. The latter distinction echoes Zunz's - see above, after n. 11. Low pioneered in Talmudic archaeology; the characterization of Low as the founder of "Jewish archaeology" in general - repeated frequently since Immanuel Low's sermon at his father's funeral (Low Lipot vdgtisztessige [Last Honours to Leopold Low] [Szeged; Szegedi Izr. Hitkozseg, 1876], 27 [in Hungarian]) - is to be qualified accordingly. "Die Pflege," 10, cf. also 7.

There is often meaningful interaction between scholarship, on the one hand, and religious attitudes or religio-political agendas, on the other: they nurture and restrain one another. Low's views on the development of halakhah informed his attitude toward religious reform, and his openness to reform confronted him with thorny questions on halakhic change. His positions on reform were close to those of Zacharias Frankel (both men were in favor of relatively limited changes in religious life), and in their scholarly programs the two scholars also shared an emphasis on the history of Jewish law as the overarching theme for WdJ as they conceived it. In their subsequent scholarship they brought this conception to fruition in different ways and to different degrees, but no doubt they were the initiators of this discipline or approach.22 In 1841, Frankel wrote that a developmental history of halakhah had been on his mind for many years.23 Low, on his part, in his first published article in 1837, wrote about the need for a "historical presentation of the organism and progressive development in Talmud and Talmudism."24 What he meant was a recounting of the history of halakhah and of Jewish religion in general. Chronologically, Frankel's horizon publishing the Beilage (and abandoning the encyclopedia plan) Low apparently acted on the advice of Adolph Jellinek (GS 5:201; cf. also 205-6). After the discontinuation of BCh, Low planned to publish an annual titled "Jahrbiicher fur jiidische Geschichte, Archaologie, Ritualkunde und Literatur" - see BCh 10 (1867): 717 - but his plan did not materialize. In the early 1930s Victor (Avigdor) Aptowitzer was commissioned by the Society for the Advancement of Jewish Scholarship (Gesellschaft zur Forderung des Wissenschaft des Judentums) to write a comprehensive work "on the history of halakhah from Mishnaic times to our age"; Yaakov Sussmann, "אביגדור אפטוביצר: יובל לפטירתו", Jewish Studies 35 (1994/95): 87. Such a work - which was never carried out by him - is still a desideratum in a way, despite - or perhaps precisely because of - all subsequent attempts and progress made in research.

[50*]</page><page sequence="11">Sinai (Tamas) Turan was basically confined to the Talmudic period, while Low's interest included medieval times25 and frequently went beyond. He often, and harshly, criticized German Jewish scholarship for a lack of proficiency in halakhic sources; for a general neglect of questions of theological and religious import; and for its overall preference for historiography and history of literature.26 For him halakhic literature was the primary source for nonhalakhic topics as well, such as realia, religion, ethics, etc. Beyond praising some early contributions of Nahman Krochmal and Zvi Hirsch Chajes to this field, Low considered Frankel not only an exception in German Jewish scholarship, but also the first genuinely qualified scholar to work on the history of Talmudic law.27 The recognition of, and emphasis on, the importance of the diachronic study of halakhah is not an invention of a single scholar (Frankel, Low, or anyone else), and of course did not emerge out of nothing. The historical method had started to inundate all fields of humanities decades before; its application to the realm of halakhah was only a matter of time - it was "timely" (zeitgemass), to use a favourite key term of the age. (The same applies to Low's interest in the organic and developmental relationship between Written and Oral law; see further below.) The application of this method to the field of halakhah and the definition of this discipline as a core field of research deserves attention on another account: it constituted an oath of loyalty to rabbinic literature and In a programmatic fashion, see "Die Pflege," 11. "Eherechtliche Studien," GS 3:192; similar criticisms (often occasioned by specific issues), are addressed to Frankel (GS 3:192-93), Zunz (GS 3:184), and Graetz (GS 1:1), among others.

Similarly, he does not use the expression "history of halakhah," but circumscribes it in different ways; see also ibid., 6. Other nineteen-century Bohemian-Moravian-Hungarian rabbinic scholars who wrote systematic-historical monographs on various branches of Talmudic law include Hirsch B. Fassel (1802-1884), rabbi of Prossnitz and later the successor of Low as rabbi of Nagykanizsa (Hungary), and Moshe Bloch (1815-1909), the first rector of the Rabbinical Seminary of Budapest.

Considered moribund by many,28 rabbinic literature was for Frankel and Low the main source - and its thorough study was a prerequisite - for the review of some branches of Jewish law, as required by the reconfiguration of the relationship between state and religion in those days. The urgency and social-political pressure related to this reconfiguration explains why topics like oaths, marriage, personal status, the procedure of rabbinic courts etc., feature so prominently in the early WdJ in general, and in Frankel's and Low's oeuvre in particular. In fact, several of Low's studies were formulated as expert opinion solicited and initiated by governmental authorities and other bodies. 3. History of Religion Neither of the two above-mentioned categories used by Low captures the scope and method of his longer works, let alone his scholarly agenda in its entirety. The term "Talmudic archaeology" is inappropriate on account of his vested scholarly interest in historical change and because his research extends to periods far beyond antiquity; and the term "(history of) Jewish law (halakhah)" does not fit either, since halakhic literature is far from being his sole source. A third term, used in his works with remarkable emphasis and frequency, seems to be more appropriate to characterize his fields of interest in their entirety: i.e., "history of religion" (Religionsgeschichte).29 In this field See the programmatic article by Zunz, "Etwas iiber die rabbinische Literatur," 4-5. GS 2:466-71 (review, from 1858, of Geiger's Urschrift); "Die Pflege," 5; Graphische Requisiten, l:vii; Lebensalter, ix; GS 1:319, 330-31, 449; see also at n. 74 below; etc. Wilhelm Vatke's influential Die Religion des Alten Testamentes nach den kanonischen Buchern entwickelt (the first part of his Die biblische Theologie) (Berlin: Bethge, 1835)": e.g., had already used the term "history of religion in general" ("Religionsgeschichte iiberhaupt"; 7), as well as expressions like "the religion of the Old Testament and its history" (177) (for a similar expression in the title of an earlier book, see ibid., 178 n. 1); and as a possible name for the discipline he pursued, he proposes "history of the religious and ethical ideas of the Old and New Testament" ("Geschichte der religiosen und ethischen Vorstellungen des Alten und Neuen Testaments"; 10). Nevertheless, the terms "Religionsgeschichte," "history of religion(s)" etc. (especially as the name of an academic discipline) gained wider currency only from the late 1860s; see Karl-Heinz Kohl, "Geschichte der Religionswissenschaft," Handbuch religionswissenschaftlicher Grundbegriffe (ed.

Krochmal and Abraham Geiger as his peers.30 It should come as no surprise that for him (and for his generation) (Jewish) archaeology was inseparable from the history of (Jewish) religion: since the primary source material for Talmudic archaeology - in the broad sense in which he used the term - was Talmudic, that is, "religious"; therefore, exploring any given topic in archaeology should involve, first and foremost, a historical analysis of these "religious" sources.31 II. Specimens of Scholarship Below I give tidbits of Low^ scholarly output: treatments and insights, most of which are still important and relevant, but barely noticed, appreciated, or acknowledged in more recent scholarship. These samples - organized under three thematic headings, and followed by brief and separate discussions of his two major works - are confined to those of his studies which are based primarily Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1988-2001), 1:239-42; Kurt Rudolph, "Theologie," ibid., 5:193-94; Sigurd Hjelde, Die Religionswissenschaft und das Christentum (Leiden,: Brill, 1994), 67-75 (on Otto Pfleiderer), and 129-69; Rudolf Smend, Lehrbuch der alttestamentlichen Religionsgeschichte (2d ed.; Freiburg: Mohr, 1899), 1-5; G. van der Leeuw, Phanomenologie der Religion (2d ed.; Tubingen: Mohr [Siebeck], 1956), ch. 112 (788-98). Terms used by Low here and there, such as "scientific theology" ("wissenschaftliche Theologie") (e.g., "Blumen auf Grabern" [1858], GS 3:444); "Jewish theology'1 or "Jewish historical theology" ("jiidische [historische] Theologie") (GS 2:469-70, 473); "Jewish theological scholarship" ("judisch-theologischen Wissenschaft") (GS 3:470); denote more or less the same discipline. The first call to distinguish between the two fields (history of religion and theology), with regard to the study of Christianity, was raised by Franz Overbeck in the 1870s; it was a lone voice, for a long time - see Rudolph, ibid., 193-96. See his review of Geiger's Urschrift (GS 2:470), and cf. above, at n. 26. There is little justification therefore in Samuel Krauss' criticism of Low for blending the two fields: "Leopold L6w as an Archaeologist of the Talmud," Magyar Izrael 4 (1911): 102-3 (in Hungarian). (This article, together with contributions by W. Bacher and M. Guttmann on other aspects of Low's scholarship, appeared in a centennial commemorative issue dedicated to Low. These brief articles by great scholars - unfortunately, but fitting the periodical and reflecting its milieu - contain little more than brief, general assessments and eulogies.) There is more substance in the other criticism Krauss offers there, concerning the links between Low's scholarly and political agendas (cf. below, in "General Characterization"). Both criticisms reflect an age when Jewish scholarship was already much more compartmentalized. [53*]</page><page sequence="14">Leopold Low and the Study of Rabbinic Judaism a Bicentennial Appraisal on rabbinic literature. His important contributions to Jewish historiography - of the modern period, in particular - are not within the purview of the present paper. Much further valuable material pertaining to rabbinic literature and culture is scattered in this segment of his oeuvre,32 as well as in his more ephemeral articles on Jewish public policy issues. 1. History of Jewish Law (Halakha) Eherechtliche Studien (Studies in Marriage Law). The studies collected under this title were originally published in BCh between the years 1859 and 1867.33 The lengthiest ones among them are devoted to polygamy and intermarriage.34 These issues, and in particular the meaning and impact of the ban on polygamy, attributed to R. Gershom (in eleventh-century Christian Europe), was much debated among medieval halakhists as well as among the pioneers of WdJ. Low's study is based on a rich collection of material and gives a nuanced account of the issue according to chronological and geographical lines. The contours of his historical reconstruction and many of his conclusions are still essentially valid.35 His collection of data on ancient Jewish intermarriage still serves as a basis for historical analysis.36 These studies are written as a response to - as, in fact, a detailed critique of- Z. Frankel's book on Talmudic marriage law.37 Characteristically, they are introduced by a historical survey of, and reflections on, Jewish and non-Jewish views on the philosophical (or legal-ethical) foundations of marriage.38 See, for example, GS 2:225-27, on the use of coffee in sixteenth-eighteenth century halakhic and cultural history; cf.

Similarly to Roman law (and with reference to Savigny and Kant), Low conceives Jewish marriage as a legal-contractual relationship and not as an ethical concept (Hegel, followed by Z. Frankel). Cf.

The Talmudic principle of "the law of the [non Jewish] state is law'5 was much invoked in the political and religious struggles for emancipation in the first half of the nineteenth century. Low offered, for the first time, a brief yet comprehensive overview of the history of this principle from its beginnings in third-century Babylonia to his own day - an overview that greatly improved previous treatments of the topic.39 Subsequent scholarship added much in detail, but many of Low's basic observations are still valid.40 The informative and matter-of-fact survey is bracketed by a critical review, at the beginning of the article, of contemporary views on the original scope of the principle, and brief observations at the end on the tacit acceptance of the radical, de facto, expansion of the scope of this principle by contemporary orthodoxy 41 Responsa. Many of Low's above-mentioned "Studies in Marriage Law," as well as a good number of his other studies, were written as actual responsa - or expert opinions - to legal questions by Jewish or non-Jewish religious and communal bodies, functionaries or lay persons. The result is an interesting blend of old and new: halakhic arguments and exploration of the subject in the history of halakhah (with much attention to details and differences according to time and place), combined with modem scholarly proclivities such as the critical review of past scholarship, and curiosity about a variety of subjects not directly related to the main issue at hand 42 This blend is partly a product of a Spur: Frauen und Gender in Aschkenas (ed.

His responsum on the permissibility of a Caesarean section,43 for instance, beyond contributing much to the history of rabbinic embryology and psychology, is a perceptive analysis of the role of scientific insights in the halakhic process. 2. History of Jewish Religion Low's openness to the non-Jewish environment and to recognizing cultural influences - always controlled by his unwavering conviction that such influences neither add to, nor detract from, authentic Judaism44 - granted him important insights wherever he turned. Some of these insights are yet to be recognized, and many of them are yet to be fully researched. The Doctrine of God. In a mini-essay on Talmudic anthropomorphism, within a long polemic essay on Graetz's historical views concerning the origins of Kabbalah, Low scorns German Jewish scholarship's lack of interest in Talmudic theology (that is, "theology" in the narrower sense, i.e., doctrines about God). He emphasizes that Talmudic theology is far from rejecting anthropomorphism ah ovo or systematically. Jews in the Talmudic age, similarly to significant early Christian or Jewish-Christian circles (such as those represented by the Ps-Clementines and Tertullian, for example), could hardly conceive an entirely "incorporeal," abstract, spiritual God.45 Ancient Jews and Christians alike became exposed to such doctrines first via is likely to have been acquainted with (living there from 1835 to 1837), represent an earlier, somewhat similar hybrid genre of scholarly essay and rabbinic decision. Part of Kunitz's literary estate was allegedly given to Low so that he could prepare it for publication; see Ignaz Reich, Beth-El: Ehrentempel verdienter ungarischer Israeliten (2d ed.; Pest: Alois Bucsansky, 1868), 1:176. (His information has yet to be verified.) "Die Kaiserschnitt" (1866), GS 3:379-406. "Die Tradition" (1861), GS 1:296. For the important distinction between divine incorporeality and immateriality, see also Low's "Lebensbetrachtung des Judenthums" (1859), GS 1:130 (noting also that there is no expression for such concepts in Talmudic language); "Salomon Munk" (1867), GS 2:457. Cf. Wesley Williams, "A Body Unlike Bodies: Transcendent Anthropomorphism in the Ancient Semitic Tradition and Early Islam," JAOS 129 (2009): 19-28 (and literature cited there). [56*]</page><page sequence="17">Sinai (Tamas) Turan Alexandrian Hellenistic philosophy and Gnosis.46 Low's brief remarks went against the grain of German WdJ views on the matter, which were heavily influenced by Protestant theology. In fact, he shifted the terms of the historical debate on theological anthropomorphisms from a focus on Biblical translation to a focus on Talmud and philosophy; and from a binary and one-dimensional developmental approach (original vs. secondary meanings, pristine ideas vs. apologetics, etc.) to a recognition of the complexities of ancient Jewish "theology."47 Only after WWI did Jewish scholarship begin to deal with the problem in its full rabbinic dimensions, and with the sophistication anticipated by Low's remarks.48 Wreath and Crown. Low's long, rich, and eclectic essay on the history of wreath and crown49 (from the Bible to Josephus and Kabbalah, from Egypt to Rome and Israel, from bride to poet and king, from liturgy to aesthetics, terminology, law, and cult) belongs partly to archaeology, partly to folklore - and it may be safely put into the elastic sack called "history of religion." "Die neueste Geschichte der Kabbalah" (1863), GS 2:49-53; similar ideas are expressed in his "Die talmudische Lehre vom gottlichen Wesen" (1866), GS 1:185-86. It should be noted that Graetz was the first to expose WdJ to the early scholarship of the 1820s-1830s on Gnosticism (in its relation to Christian thought, by August Neander and Ferdinand Christian Baur). In his Gnosticismus und Judenthum (which was the published version of his doctoral dissertation; Krotoschin: B. L. Monasch, 1846; 40), Graetz himself related briefly to the Greek (and Gnostic) speculative and abstract idea of God. Both for Low and Graetz (and unlike in parts of subsequent scholarship), Hellenistic philosophy and Gnosis were unequivocally external in origin to what they regarded as mainstream Talmudic Judaism. Low's mini-essay seems to imply that the real division with regard to biblical anthropomorphisms (in early rabbinic times at least) was not so much between Jews and Christians as between anthropomorphists and spiritualists. As in halakhic exegesis one finds literalist, concretizing trends and nonliteralist, spiritualizing trends side by side from earliest times (both reflecting or producing peshat interpretations), such is also the case with aggadic-theological exegesis. (And, one may add, both trends had polemic and apologetic motives at times.) Arthur Marmorstein (1882-1946) and Max Kadushin (1895-1980) pioneered in this field.

Low noticed institutional and ceremonial parallels between medieval German "Brotherhoods" and guilds, on the one hand, and late medieval Jewish religious associations, especially the burial society, as we know it in Ashkenazic lands from the sixteenth century, on the other.50 The history and development of these institutions in their regional settings are issues which are far from settled.51 3. History ofTalmudic Literature The regular supplements to Ben Chananja published in its last two volumes (1866-1867) constituted perhaps the first periodical devoted specifically to "Das Vereinswesen in Israel: Eine Vorlesung" (1865), GS 2:150-51. For a similar suggestion about possible external influences on the related issue of "Jahrzeit," see "Die Fusion des deutschen und sefardischen Ritus in Paris," (1866), GS 4:264; cf. Immanuel Low and Salamon Klein, The Chevra of Szeged, from 1787 to 1887 (Szeged: A Szegedi Chevra kiadasa, 1887), 16 (in Hungarian). Immanuel Low elaborated on his father's suggestion: Low and Klein, The Chevra of Szeged, 11-18.

It seems to me that the observations of the Lows and the subject itself deserve more circulation and attention than they have received in more recent scholarship. See Sylvie-Anne Goldberg, Les deux rives du Yabbok: La maladie et la mort dans le juda'isme ashkenaze: Prague XVIe-XIXe siecle (Paris: Cerf, 1989), 110-14 (= Crossing the Jabbok: Illness and Death in Ashkenazi Judaism in Sixteenth- through Nineteenth Century Prague [tr. Carol Cosman; Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996], 83-86). (I am grateful to Michael K. Silber for the references to the works by Marcus and Goldberg.) Goldberg relates very briefly - and with much reservation - to the theory of the Lows, but erroneously attributes all the works to the son and altogether omits the father's name; see 110 n. 21, and 285 in the French edition; 246 n. 21, and 285 in the English edition.

[58*]</page><page sequence="19">Sinai (Tamas) Turan Talmudic research.52 Most of its contributions belonged to philology and realia, but literary history, newly discovered manuscript pages, etc., were also treated occasionally. For Low himself Talmudic philology was an "auxiliary science,"53 and the literary history of rabbinic literature was of no central interest. Yet one finds insights here and there in his works that deserve to be recorded in the history of Talmudic studies. The Concept of Oral Law. In his first published paper ("Ueber den Geist des Talmuds [On the Spirit of the Talmud]," 1837) Low argued that in ancient times, "the distinction between Written and Oral Law did not refer to different modes of receiving Law, from which the reception of an actual/concrete (eigentlich) [Oral] Tradition could be inferred, but to different ways of study and instruction."54 He apparently means that "Oral Law" in the history of revelation originally denotes more a process (of developing "Law") than a corpus (of "Law") to be learned. His later statements suggest that he considered ancient rabbinic scriptural exegesis to be the main vehicle and result of this process.55 Closely related to this notion of Oral Law is his nonliteralist understanding of the Talmudic concept of "halakhah le-Moshe mi-Sinai, " which conveys, according to him, the antiquity of certain traditions and their unbroken relevance.56 In the same article Low offers brief and subtle See above, η. 16. "Die Pflege," 10. "Ueber den Geist des Talmuds," 10 (emphasis mine); cf. 8-9. "Die Tradition," 242^13. This position resembles Maimonides' views, as opposed to typical geonic positions on the nature of Oral Law; see Jay M. Harris, How Do We Know This?: Midrash and the Fragmentation of Modern Judaism (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995), 76-82, 87-90; David E. Sklare, Samuel ben Hofni Gaon and His Cultural World: Texts and Studies (Leiden: Brill, 1996), 43—46, 159-60. For a similar recent approach, see David Weiss Halivni, Revelation Restored: Divine Writ and Critical Responses (Boulder: Westview, 1997), 85. "Ueber den Geist des Talmuds," 8-9. He refers also to the commentary of the early seventeenth-century rabbinic scholar, Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller, on m. Yadayim 4:3. Cf. also his cautiously formulated - still vague and explosive - distinction there (5-6) between "dogmatic" and "historical" truth in relation to the Bible; apparently an adaptation from, and a gesture to, Christian theology. The concept "halakhah le Moshe mi-Sinai" can be rendered in various ways: "Law given to/through/by Moses from Sinai." Low's (explosive) rendition as "Ruling of Moses from Sinai" ("Satzung/ Halacha des Moses vom Sinai") - cf. Halivni, Revelation Restored, 83, and his Breaking [59*]</page><page sequence="20">Leopold Low and the Study of Rabbinic Judaism a Bicentennial Appraisal clarifications of some further basic notions of Oral Law - or "tradition,יי to use his term - such as "halakhah" and "kabbalah." As a sequel to this early article, his "Die Tradition" (1861)57 returns to these key terms and other issues of Talmudic-halakhic Einleitungswissenschaft.58 These clarifications or characterizations of key terms of the Oral Law are brief, often ad hoc, and vague. Similar characterizations can be found in the writings of earlier decades, partly in learned dogmatic and polemic exchanges (a "genre" to which these articles themselves belong) concerning the nature of rabbinic authority, "halakhic change," the writing down of Oral Law and related matters.59 Still, the Tablets: Jewish Theology After the Shoah (Lanham, Md.: Rowman &lt;fe Littlefield, 2007), 84, 88 - was flatly rejected by Wilhelm Bacher, Tradition und Tradenten in den Schulen Palastinas und Babyloniens (Leipzig: Fock, 1914), 33. Low's view ("Ueber den Geist des Talmuds," 12-13) that a real "dogmatic" significance and meaning to the notion of the Oral Law emerged only in the Middle Ages, in part due to the Karaite controversies, is likely to be correct - see Flarris, How Do We Know This, 76-80; Sklare, Samuel ben Hofni Gaon, 160. There are a variety of Talmudic views on this matter; later, Low himself pointed out shifts toward the "dogmatic" position already in late amoraic times ("Die Tradition," 265-67). In fact, the primary purpose of the article was to critically analyze various standpoints expressed in the extensive and heated discussion among contemporaries sparked off by Frankel's "dogmatic" position (or lack of position) on the Oral Law in his Darkhei ha-Mishnah (1859). The article was written under the pseudonym "Dr. Weil." Along with his surveys of the history of Jewish archaeology (above, n. 16), and of the debate on the writing down of the Mishnah (below, n. 69), this account is one of the first contributions to the historiography of WdJ. Low ("Die Tradition," 242-57) polemicizes not only against a "vulgar concept of tradition (= Oral Law)" - which is the "dogmatic" and literalist orthodox position - but also against an "esoteric" view, of which Z. Frankel would also be a representative (255). These views are contrasted with his own "historical" approach which apparently differs from the previous ones in emphasizing and exploring the concrete methods Talmudic rabbis used in developing Oral Law (266-67). Cf. 307-17; and above, at n. 55. For additional conceptual clarifications in Talmudic Einleitungswissenschaft, see Low's review of A. Stein's book (BCh 9 [1866]), GS 3:475-79. See, e.g., Low's "Aron Chorin: Eine Biographische Skizze" (published under the pseudonym "Dr. Weil," cf. n. 57 above), BCh 6 (1863): 34-35 [= GS 2:270-71], with S. D. Luzzatto's rejoinder and Low's reply, in BCh ibid., 150-52, noting references to earlier eighteenth-century views similar to Chorin's and Luzzatto's. Low's reply (titled "Final Editorial Remark") is not signed and is not included in his bibliography. It must be added that Luzzatto's letter in BCh is a loose translation - or rather, a paraphrase - of the Hebrew original, published in אגרות שדייל (ed. Ε. Graber; Cracow: Fischer, 1894), [60*]</page><page sequence="21">Sinai (Tamas) Turan the formulations are relatively early, articulate, and innovative enough to be recorded in the history of research (or speculation) on the history and nature of Oral Law. These "nonmaximalist" interpretations of the Oral Law and related concepts - in the spirit of the "positivist historical school" - have become more or less the scholarly consensus for the last half century at least, and are relevant in Jewish theology as well.60 De-bei Rav. The expression de-bei Rav appears (among other contexts) in book titles referring to collections of Tannaitic, halakhic midrashim; its meaning in Talmudic literature has been much debated since medieval times. Low suggested that this expression refers to the Talmudic academy founded by Rav in Sura.61 The expression "de-bei Rav" appearing in book titles (or appended to book titles), accordingly, must denote books used in the Sura academy.62 Definitive evidence is yet to be found, but since the time of David Hoffmann this has been the most reasonable and uncontested view in scholarship.63 9:1403-4 (see also the accompanying letter to Low, ibid., 1402).

Ashi and Ravina are sofha hora 'ah" (b. Bava Metzia 86a) was traditionally understood from gaonic times as referring to the final "edition" or "closing" (whatever these terms mean) of the Babylonian Talmud. Since the 1930s there has been a growing scholarly consensus that the phrase does not refer to the "closure" of the Talmud (or "Talmudic age") but rather to that of the Amoraic age. Low advanced similar views ahead of his time. He showed that horaah here is not to be understood as "instruction,,י "interpretation" or "teaching," but in its narrower, regular, technical meaning in Talmudic literature: "decision," "authoritative ruling"; he surmised that it denotes a certain type of rabbinic authority or authorization which was in vogue in Amoraic Babylonia.64 Although the evidence Low produced for this latter suggestion may be flawed,65 the suggestion itself may deserve further consideration.66 It had been known since medieval times that the Babylonian Talmud was not closed as a literary work until the mid-eighth century and that there were numerous accretions to it. In his posthumuously published papers Low makes interesting suggestions as to why the Talmud was "sealed" at that time.67 He also observes (without, though, producing evidence) that "what was edited and accrued after R. Ashi is quantitatively not Litteras Tannaiticas (Jerusalem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press and Tel-Aviv: Dvir, 1957), 646-52 (in Hebrew). I did not find any mention of Low and his earlier suggestion in the scholarly literature on this issue. "Die Hora'ah" (1866), GS 4:159-66. Cf. also I. Low's supplementary note to p. 163 (GS 5:63); and S. D. Luzzatto, מחקרי היהדות (Warsaw: Ha-Tsefirah, 1913), 1.2:152. For interpretations of the expression in subsequent scholarship (and on traditional terms and theories related to the "redaction" of the Babylonian Talmud), see David Goodblatt, "The Babylonian Talmud," Aufstieg und Niedergang der romischen Welt, II, 19.2 (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1979), 307-18; Shlomo Z.

Low's remarks are found in extensive surviving fragments of a planned work - or works - on the history of the [62*]</page><page sequence="23">Sinai (Tamas) Turan much less than what was 'edited' before and by him"; and this is apparently one of the main reasons for him to extend the "Talmudic period" until the mid eighth century.68 From the perspective of important twentieth-century research trends - which have steadily upgraded the post-Amoraic contribution to the Babylonian Talmud - his suggestion is remarkable (and entirely neglected). 4. Graphische Requisiteη und Erzeugnisse der Juden (Graphic Requisites and Products of Jews) Another standard theme of Talmudic propaedeutics is dealt with in this work: the writing down of the Mishnah and of "Oral Law" in general. In his excellent survey of the entire literature - focusing more, perhaps for technical reasons, on medieval and modem opinions than on Talmudic data - he leans towards accepting Samuel David Luzzatto's view, together with his ideological stance.69 The two volumes of this book (1870-1871 )70 correspond roughly to the two parts in the title: the first dealing with writing tools and materials, the second dealing with the uses of writing, its main types and laws.71 The book covers the rabbinate and rabbinic ordination, published from his literary estate. His article "Die Hora'ah" is closely related to this planned work; cf. GS 5:87-88. GS 5:67 η. 1. Graphische Requisiten, 2:112-36. For the Mishnah, see esp. his discussion of ShaDaL's view on 120. It should be noted that this is the view Low expressed already in his early "Ueber den Geist des Talmuds," 10 (ShaDaL is not mentioned there). As for the Gemara, Low - linking together the issue of the "redaction" of the Talmud and its writing down - again finds most plausible the view of ShaDaL, according to whom both took place in the Saboraic age (134). The ideological moment of the whole debate was obviously important for Low (see 132, 136). I am not sure if this could have been the trigger for Low's interest in the history of writing among Jews and for this entire grand project (as Ismar Schorsch conjectured: From Text to Context, 327). The history of Hebrew writing (a standard topic in biblical Einleitungswissenschaft as well as in works on "antiquities") is treated at noticeable length already in Low's introduction to Jewish biblical exegesis: המפתח, Praktische Einleitung in die heilige Schrift und Geschichte der Schriftauslegung (Gross-Kanischa: Markbreiter, 1855), 1:29-40. Cf. also above, n. 18, and Low, "Jiidische Dogmen," 161. The material for the book was obviously collected over a long period of time. For a hint concerning the work in preparation (without explicitly calling it a book), see his review of Lebrecht's Kritische Lese..., BCh 7 (1864): 928. (As for the Gittin source discussed in the review, Low changed his view, cf. Graphische Requisiten, 2:133.) The method of combining the material and the literary-historical aspect follows earlier ף 63]</page><page sequence="24">Leopold Low and the Study of Rabbinic Judaism a Bicentennial Appraisal ancient period, with frequent incursions into medieval (and in some cases, into modem) times. The reader receives well-documented surveys on major halakhic controversies related to the preparation of pergamen, ink,72 printing, and so forth, concerning many topics on which the source material is virtually inexhaustible. The book is still indispensable for research in the field.73 Besides clarifying aspects of Talmudic realia, Low gives special attention to their halakhic historical context in the Middle Ages and beyond. Here also, Low does not remain aloof and does not spare the reader his opinion on authorities and on the agendas of their decisions. This is how R. Tarn emerges, for example, as Low's medieval "hero" in the book - as someone defending, through talmudic exegesis, existing (lenient) practices against halakhic stringencies: "He was the father of Talmud-based reform (Reform auf talmudischem Standpunkte), and this is his significance in the history of religion, unrecognized until now."74 The sentence of course is indicative of Low's own convictions; it could serve as a sort of motto for him. In this book, Low makes forays in another direction as well. He was the first to collect written (rabbinic and historical) sources on Jewish attitudes to works on archaeology such as Jahn's Biblische Archaologie, Pt. 1, vol. 1, 404-42). For medieval controversies about using various types of vitriol in the ink, see Graphische Requisiteη 1:145-59. Low's conjectural emendation of the unintelligible "Glutstein" (quoted from MahariL in Magen Abraham, O.H. 32.2) to Gallitzenstein is confirmed by a gloss in a manuscript of the Mordekhai (by Mordekhai ben Hillel, thirteenth century): Julius Wellesz, Magyar Zsido Szemle 30 (1913): 287 (in Hungarian). Cf. Yaakov Sussmann,'"תורה שבעל פה' פשוטה כמשמעה - כוחו של קוצו של יו"ד," מחקרי תלמוד (ed. Y. Sussmann et al.; Jerusalem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 2005), 3.1:281 n. 83; 282 η. 1; 289 n. 25. In 1880, Immanuel Low planned a new updated edition of his father's book and asked Steinschneider to send him his notes and remarks on the book (which he promised to do in due course); see George A. Kohut, "Die Kohut-Low-Steinschneider Korrespondenz," MGWJ 78/1 (1934): 213, 224 (=Festschrift Immanuel Low zum 80. Geburtstage). In his letter to Kohut (from 1930), Low recalls the compliments paid by Steinschneider (in 1872, during his lectures on Hebrew manuscripts, attended by I. Low) on the Hebrew index of the book - compiled by I. Low (Kohut, "Korrespondenz," 230). Graphische Requisiten 1:130-31. In order for the reader not to miss the point, the chapter is given the title "Reform in the Middle Ages." For other instances of R. Tarn's defense of existing practices - the "status quo" - see ibid., 153, 167, 188-89. For similar statements on R.

He demonstrates the presence of art in Jewish life, contrary to biased views widespread then. His summary assessment of rabbinic attitudes to art - some time-bound and value-laden elements notwithstanding - is as correct as ever.75 5) Die Lebensalter (Ages of Man in Jewish Literature) It happens not infrequently in scholarly careers that an early pet project takes more time than anything else and is carried out "last in deed, though first in thought." This may have been the case with this last of Low's major works - a nearly 500-page-long, highly original study of Jewish cultural history in antiquity.76 Low planned this work, and collected material for it, at least from ,'The collected data are elevating and depressing at the same time. They are elevating, because they attest the sensitivity and receptivity of Jews toward art and their readiness to adopt the cultural assets of their times and environment, even among most adverse circumstances. And they are depressing because they reveal the sometimes thwarting, sometimes indulgent, but never initiating roles of Jewish theologians in these efforts" (Graphische Requisiten, 1:35-36). Modern scholarly treatments ofthe subject sometimes offer a "revisionist" thesis which is no less tendentious (in the opposite direction) than the thesis of Jewish "aniconism" they try to counter - and that was countered already by Low. For a rare example of modern scholarship that relates to Low's treatment, see Avram Kampf, "The Interpretation of the Second Commandment," in Writings About Art (ed. Carole Gold Calo; Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1994), 47. Low's introduction mentions that Wilhelm Wackemagel's slim volume addressing the same topic in classical and medieval German literatures (Die Lebensalter: Ein Beitrag zur vergleichenden Sitten- undRechtsgeschichte [Basel: Bahnmaier (Detloff), 1862], 74 pp.) reached him when his work was already ready for print. Yet he makes reference to this work at several points. We learn from Low that he did not have access to major public libraries (cf. Graphische Requisiten, 1 :VII) and it may well be that this work reached him not long before he submitted his book to the printer; I see no reason to cast doubt on the accuracy of these statements of Low. For further (earlier and later) literature - mostly dealing with classical antiquity, but mentioning Low's work as well - see Franz Boll, "Die Lebensalter; Ein Beitrag zur antiken Ethologie und zur Geschichte der Zahlen," Neuen Jahrbucher fiir das klassische Altertum, Geschichte und deutsche Literatur 31 (1913): 90-91. Low apparently was unaware of these earlier publications; in any case, he himself anticipated his book by a series of articles published in 1859 on "The Jewish View of Life" - his first major scholarly publication in German which utilizes, to a large extent, ancient rabbinic sources: "Lebensbetrachtung des Judenthums," GS 1:53-131; cf. esp. 54—60, 67-74, 83-86. It is to be noted that Steinschneider's copy of Low's Lebensalter, with his handwritten ף 65]</page><page sequence="26">Leopold Low and the Study of Rabbinic Judaism a Bicentennial Appraisal , 77 the late 1850s. It deals with the periodization of life; with embryology and gynecology; with the legal ramifications of, and rituals related to, all major stages of life (except dying and death); and with much more, from naming a child to dancing, walking, and smoking. He was the first to point out the essentially late-medieval Ashkenazic origins of the bar-mitzvah ceremony as we know it in modem times;78 and he traced the history and sources of late medieval German-Jewish synagogal customs related to the parturient - an instructive example of reborrowing.79 In many chapters of the book the author follows his subject up to his own era, collecting data from medieval and later periods. In the chapter - the longest one of the work - on leisure and play, he quotes a passage by Zunz on children's games,80 just to introduce his own first hand account of Jewish children's games in contemporary Galicia and Hungary - and to contrast it with Zunz's "bookish" remarks.81 The historian changes his notes, is held by the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. Cf. his "Lebensperioden," Hebraische Bibliographie 13 (1873): 92-4 which does not mention Low. A sample of these notes was published by Kohut, "Korrespondenz," 213, 231-32. See the end of the previous note, and see "Die Tradition,262-64 יי. Lebensalter, 210-17. Cf. Ivan Marcus, The Jewish Life Cycle: Rites of Passage from Biblical to Modern Times (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2004), 82-105 (on the development of the ceremony); 23; 278 nn. 36 and 45 (specifically on Low's work).

Leopold Zunz, Zur Geschichte undLiteratur (Berlin: Veit, 1845), 157-213. This chapter by Zunz stimulated generations of scholars to study medieval cultural history and folklore: family life, education, popular religion, etc.; besides Low's works, see, among others, the 61 -page-long study by Abraham Berliner (Aus der inneren Leben der deutschen Juden im Mittelalter [Berlin: Julius Benzian, 1871]), and Moritz Giidemann's works. Referring to Zunz' passage, he remarks: "This account relates only to German and French Jews, and literature is its only source. Other sources were not available to him. Medieval folk traditions were long extinguished in Germany when he wrote his famous "Characteristics" [the title of the chapter in Zunz's book]. Not so in Eastern countries such as Hungary. Here life gives much richer information than literature. Among children's games described below there is hardly any extinct; in Galicia, from which most of them were transplanted to Hungary, all of them still flourish" {Lebensalter, 287-88). The remark about the extinction of medieval folk traditions in early German Jewry is of course hyperbolic. [66*]</page><page sequence="27">Sinai (Tamas) Turan "hat" here to that of a folklorist. A seminal work of nineteenth-century Jewish scholarship, this book anticipated to some extent the so-called "corporeal" or "materialistic" (anthropocentric or vitalistic) turn in Jewish studies in recent decades. Its translation into English (or Hebrew) would continue to inspire scholarship in cultural history and folklore. III. General Characterization and Concluding Remarks It seems that in Jewish intellectual and religious history, the era of WdJ - the "age of Criticism," as Geiger called it82 - is not over, despite all the substantial developments and changes in Jewish scholarship in the twentieth century. A survey of the oeuvres (and biographies) of scholars like Low highlights not only changes in method and agenda since their times, but also the limits of scholarship in shaping Judaism's religious landscape. R. Koppel Reich, a respected rabbinic leader of interwar Hungarian orthodoxy (and its representative in the upper chamber of the Parliament together with his Neolog counterpart, Immanuel Low) is said to have told a yeshiva bachur entering the (Neolog) Rabbinical Seminary of Budapest: "You forfeit your share in the World to Come, without securing a good place in this one." Many scholars associated with WdJ found themselves between two worlds (geographically, culturally, religiously); and in the long run, instead of the heavenly academy, some of them were probably to be content with finding a place in some intermediary academic hall of fame. A significant part of early lL&lt;i/-output bears the mark of inyanei de-yoma, and of the emancipatory legal agenda in particular (set by the Paris Sanhedrin of 1807); note its concern with oaths, marriage laws, status and procedures of the bet din, etc. Many of Low's essays revolve around institutional, educational and religious reform, but one finds polemics or some measure of partisanship in most of his scholarly works.83 Most modern readers of these works will find "Einleitung in das Studium der jiidischen Theologie," (1849) in Nachgelassene Schriften (Berlin: Gerschel, 1875), 2:10 (cf, also 27); "Allgemeine Einleitung in die Wissenschaft des Judenthums" (1874), ibid., 216. Only a small part of Low's political writings is included in the GS. The division of the GS material into volumes is not transparent, and given the lack of an editorial foreword - not the only feature shared by this edition and Zunz's Gesammelte [67*]</page><page sequence="28">Leopold LOw and the Study of Rabbinic Judaism a Bicentennial Appraisal that many of his judgmental remarks - on what "healthy exegesis" is; on what is "timely" and fitting for "cultural progress";84 and the like - fly in the face of (not so recent) canons of academic objectivity.85 Yet it should be borne in mind that this belief in continuity and progress was the hallmark of the age; it was the Zeitgeist.86 Low, like many others, did not foresee if, when, and to what extent, general historical "progress" (in the name of which he scorned, now and again, traditional "orthodoxy") would prove to be an illusory slogan. He might also have been captivated by the idea that halakhic policy can and should be guided by "timeliness" and "progress,'י and be based at the same time on halakhic, historical and halakhic-historical data; even if he was also well aware of the Schriften - one can only speculate on the logical structure of this (generally superb) edition. I find the following loose thematic structure: vol. 1: studies on fundamentals of Jewish religion and theology; vol. 2: historical studies on current Jewish religious movements and on some esoteric doctrines; personalia; vol. 3: historical studies (and expert opinions) on archaeology and Jewish law; vol. 4: historical studies (and expert opinions) on synagogue-related reform agendas and emancipatory political agendas; vol. 5: bibliography, unpublished fragments, selected correspondence, indexes. These headings (only a few articles do not fit them) reflect only partially the extent to which Low's scholarly agenda was set by the religious-political agendas of his times. For "cultural progress," see, e.g., "Eherechtliche Studien," GS 3:75, 80, 201, 218. For "healthy exegesis," see ibid., 124, 194, 216; "Die Tradition," 317; GS 2:460, 476. Low was criticized for his polemical style already by Moritz Steinschneider in his brief obituary of him and in his remarks on the Lebensalter: Hebraische Bibliographie 15 (1875): 136; 16 (1876): 16. For Low's commitment to objectivity, see "Eherechtliche Studien," GS, 3:13-14; "Zur Maimonidesfrage" (1858), GS 1:330; and cf. above, nn. 24, 31. Such declarations are, of course, often nothing but rhetorical flourishes in the humanities. Low's "yetzer" for shaping Jewish life may have been stronger than that of many of his contemporaries. And, as Michael K. Silber has observed (in a private communication), the fact that Low published almost exclusively in his own journal and was his own editor may have contributed to his unrestrained style. Felix Perles' notion of Low's threefold (Jewish-German-Hungarian/Magyar) education and his attribution of Low's "fiery disposition and vivid style" to the latter component - in the review of the GS (1901) in his Judische Skizzen (2d ed.; Leipzig: Engel, 1920), 220 - belongs to the realm of "national characterology." In any case, conspicuous agendas make less of a problem for scholarship than inconspicuous ones (of which one may find plenty, to this day). Of course, even if orthodoxy did not subscribe to the idea of progress, it still had to cope with change, and to make its own reassessments, readjustments and realignments in the name of continuity. [68*]</page><page sequence="29">Sinai (Tamas) Turan fact87 that popular religious practice ("custom") was shaped - both in the past and to an even greater degree in his own time - by powerful forces beyond rabbinic control, in stringencies and leniencies alike.88 But even those who prefer recondite and positivistic ideals for scholarship (a la Steinschneider) over Nietzschean ideals of radical "relevance," will probably admit that periods of intense external cultural challenges necessitating a "revaluation of (almost) all values" (Nietzsche) were usually creative and innovative periods in Jewish intellectual history. And Low's scholarship was creative and innovative. The emancipatory agenda and its ambience of "revaluation" mobilized his vast Jewish knowledge and general learning, energized his sharp eye and acute historical judgment, and helped him not to miss the forest for the trees. He discerned change in Jewish law and custom at every corner; he called this change (when initiated or approved by the rabbis) "reform"; he looked for historical reasons and detects (or suspects) external influences.89 Rabbenu Tarn was a guardian of the tradition just by virtue of being - to use a terminology which, as far as I know, was not Low's - a "conservative," or "moderate," "reformer." It seems that Low viewed Maimonides in a similar way.90 Against a vulgar dogma of The so-called "historical school of law" in Germany (which had an impact on the emergence of the positive-historical school of WdJ, and the most famous representative of which was Friedrich Carl von Savigny), stressed not only the importance of "organic," bottom-up, development of law, but also the role of jurists in discarding antiquated elements of a legal tradition. See Georg G. Iggers, The German Conception of History: The National Tradition of Historical Thought from Herder to the Present (2d ed.; Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1983), 66 and 308 n. 10. 170-71 ,"המהלכים והעומדים"; "Die Tradition," 297; "Blumen auf Grabern," 440, 443, 445-48. For a halakhic position that confirms Low's analysis on the latter issue (without mentioning his name), see R. Jekuthiel Judah Greenwald, כל בו על אבלות (New York: Feldheim, 1973), 59-60. For the unrestricted and tendentious use of the term "Reform" in such halakhic, historical contexts, see, e.g., "Dina de-Malekhutha Dina" 348, 358; "Die Dispensation von Gelobnissen" (1866), GS 3:364 5:86. One of Low's guiding principles in looking for, and speculating on, external influences in medieval times seems to have been that a custom which is not traceable in the Islamic realm may well have a Western/Christian/ European component or trigger. See his "Die Fusion," 254-55. The latter article is the first major study comparing medieval Askhkenazi and Sephardic Jewish law. See his programmatic letter to Rappoport: "Zur Maimonidesfrage"; "Die Tradition," [69*]</page><page sequence="30">Leopold Low and the Study of Rabbinic Judaism a Bicentennial Appraisal an immutable "Tradition," and in legitimizing the feasibility of "reform,,י Low not only recruited medieval halakhic codificatory literature and exegesis, but also drew attention to the subversive potential of nonstandard, innovative modern exegesis, especially exegesis of the Mishnah - even if it is without any apparent practical import and notwithstanding the personal faithfulness of its originators to traditional religion.91 As an adherent of the "historical school," scholarship was the compass for him in assessing religious practices and conceiving religious policies92 - this is why he could not stand parochial community leadership, Neolog or Orthodox.93 The history of Jewish law and religion, which most early scholars of WdJ were reluctant to pursue as a main field of study, partly because of the implications of this field for struggles in regard to the future shape of Judaism, 249; the obituary of S. D. Luzzatto (1865), GS 2:449; the review of A. Stein's book, GS 3:477; and cf. Geiger's letter (from 1854), GS 5:149. But while R. Tam defended existing practices, according to Low, through ingenious Talmudic interpretation, Maimonides made lone, scholastic steps ahead through codification, with the help of critical and rationalistic sifting of the Talmudic material in certain branches of law - apparently more by omission than by commission. Low put great emphasis on the bottom-to-top, "grassroots" pattern that he discerned in R. Tarn's times, in which the "people" are the real initiators of "change," and create it by fait accompli. See his "Rom und Jerusalem," GS 1:352-53; "Die Fusion," 250 η. 1; and above, n. 74. See also his halakhic methodological credo: "Fahren am Sabbath," 301-2. Low also clearly identified with the sifting and eliminating function of halakhic scholarship that he recognized in the Maimonidean code; cf. above, n. 87, and see the motto of his "המהלכים והעומדים", He-Halutz 3 [1856], 161 (a citation from the end of m. Tamid2:2). According to I. Low's terse characterization in his sermon on the fiftieth anniversary of his father's death, "the research of the series of past renewals was his scholarly aim" (Two Hundred Sermons [1919-1939] [Szeged: A Szegedi Hitkozseg kiadasa, 1939], 1:187 [in Hungarian]). See Low's review of Pineles' דרכה של תורה (BCh 6 [1863]), GS 2:476-78; cf. "Die Tradition," 268-72. In 1862, Low (in his review of Moses Hess's Rom und Jerusalem) speaks about the "reshaping of Judaism," a process that is to be based on "the word of God, which is understood better and better through the mediation of scholarship" - a statement characteristic of his stance (and of the stance of many adherents of WdJ); see "Rom und Jerusalem, die letzte Nationalitats-Frage" (1862), GS 1:354. This created much common ground between the Lows and Ignaz Goldziher, and led to a close friendship between Goldziher and I. Low. The fourth volume of the GS (1898) is dedicated (by I. Low) to Goldziher, "the loyal promoter of his [L. Low's] work." I hope to comment on this dedication on another occasion. [70*]</page><page sequence="31">Sinai (Tamas) Turan was for Low a most attractive and relevant discipline, for the same reason. With his thematic-systematic rather than literary, exegetical, or textual mindset, he introduced postbiblical "archaeology" and folklore into Jewish scholarship. One of the pioneers of the history of halakhah, he made important contributions to historiography, and made forays into a number of other fields as well. Combining thorough Talmudic training and university education, he became one of the first representatives of the blend of traditional lamdan and modem critical scholar, so typical of vintage WdJ. This fact, as well as similarities of religious outlook and some shared research fields, make him a Hungarian counterpart to Zacharias Frankel.94 On the other hand, Low,s marked interest in the history of Jewish religion and theology (and his liberal views in these matters), as well as his strong political and polemical involvement, bring him close to Abraham Geiger.95 In Hungary, where the dynamic of religious struggle was different than in Germany (radical reform was much weaker and orthodoxy much stronger), Low played the roles of both to some extent. Cf. Louis Ginzberg on Frankel in his Students, Scholars and Saints (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1928), 215-16; for the ideological affinity between the two, see FrankePs letter to Low, GS 5:133-35. For a biographic element shared by the two, see above, n. 6. See above, n. 30. In the context of Low's interest in rabbinic theology, compare Immanuel Low's later remark: "I am ashamed whenever it comes to my mind that a systematic theology of the Talmud had to wait for a Protestant minister to be written [Ferdinand Wilhelm Weber, System der altsynagogalen palastinischen Theologie, aus Targum, Midrasch und Talmud (Leipzig: Dorffling 81 Franke, 1880) - S. T.]" ("Some reflections," Magyar Zsido Szemle 1 [1884]: 59 [in Hungarian]). For the affinities between Low and Geiger, see Perles, Judische Skizzen, 218-19, 222; and idem, "Bibel," in Abraham Geiger: Leben und Lebenswerk (ed. L. Geiger; Berlin: Reimer, 1910), 316-327, p. 318. For Low's relationship to Geiger, see his letter (from Vienna, Oct. 27, 1874) to his son Tobias in which he asks him to initiate official condolences to Geiger's family from the Neolog Jewish community of Pest. He adds: "The reaction[ary party = orthodoxy] was impressed in fact only by two clergyman (pap) of the Reform party: Geiger, and - your father! On my way to the Augsburg synod [ 1871 ] I experienced this very frequently, and I experience it now, too.

Hidvegi; Budapest: Mult es Jovo, 1999), 230 (in Hungarian). Among the reasons why Low was not chosen as the successor of Lob Schwab in the rabbinate of Pest, I. Low mentions his father's theological views which were "too liberal" for the community of Pest (Low and Kulinyi, The History of the Jews in Szeged, 206). ף 71]</page><page sequence="32">Leopold Low and the Study of Rabbinic Judaism a Bicentennial Appraisal The first champion of WdJ and of a positive-historical approach to Judaism in Hungary, his scholarly legacy was carried on, first and foremost, by his son. His studies in Germany made Immanuel Low to turn to Semitic philology (in which he quickly established himself as a leading authority), but thematically he shared his father's interests in realia and folklore.96 Beyond his son, and also through him, Leopold Low's impact on Hungarian Jewish scholarship was decisive and lasting.97 Samuel Krauss's major works on "archaeology,"98 and For a statement by the son on the father's pioneering contributions to research on realia/archaeology in general, that acknowledges his own debt to his father's work, see I.

Low's monumental work on "Jewish botanies" (Die Flora derJuden [4 vols; Vienna and Leipzig: Lowit, 1923-1934]), note his father's "Lebensbetrachtung des Judenthums," 67-74; "Die Tradition," 274-82; "Kranz und Krone," 414-15 (on saffron; see esp. the note by Immanuel Low on 415); for "fauna," see "Die Tradition," 304-7; with I. Low's "Ha-iddana," cf. the father's "Die Pflege," 2, and "Die Fusion," 250. See also above, n. 51. His writings and his authority were the main vehicles of this "local" impact, mostly on scholars associated with the Rabbinical Seminary of Budapest. The Seminary was opened in 1877, after Low's death; his son was not on its faculty either (but he was a member of the board). The complex relationship of the father with the Budapest community was partly inherited by the son; cf. above, η. 1. Immanuel Low's widely acclaimed homiletics was an efficient medium for spreading his own scholarship in Hungary - primarily its spirit, but its contents as well, to some extent. Several hundred of Immanuel Low's sermons (all in Hungarian) were published in interwar Hungary. On Krauss' indebtedness to Low's work, see the introduction to his קדמוניות התלמוד (Odessa: Moriah, 1914), v-vi. Only one volume appeared in this edition; it was subsequently reprinted without the introduction, as vol. 1, part I, of the Berlin Vienna edition (above, n. 10). Krauss' Synagogale Altertumer (Berlin and Vienna: Harz, 1922) is an elaboration of parts of Low's plan for a book with the same title (GS 5:21-33); see ibid., p. 1. It is noteworthy that Krauss' entire work on Talmudic archaeology was conceived as an extension of biblical archaeology (cf. Talmudische Archaologie [3 vols.; Leipzig: Fock, 1910-1912], l:vii), and indeed follows a structure which we find for almost 180 years previously in books on biblical/Hebrew archaeology (see above, n. 13). The field covered by his Talmudische Archaologie he calls elsewhere "Private Antiquities" (Privat-Altertumer; Synagogale Altertumer, vi), [72*]</page><page sequence="33">Sinai (Tamas) Turan most of the major works of Ludwig Blau on Jewish antiquity (on the history of the Hebrew book, on Jewish magic, on the history of Jewish divorce), along with his many other works, were profoundly influenced by Low's oeuvre - just to mention his two closest "disciples."99 Low had a share in shaping the profile of Hungarian Jewish scholarship in its entirety, as well, beyond these more or less detectable influences of a distinguished scholar upon others. Compared with the scholarship of the Breslau or Vienna rabbinical seminaries, the rabbinical seminary in Budapest (and by extension, the scholarly output of Hungarian Jewry in WdJ, the bulk of which was produced by professors and graduates of this seminary) stands out by its marked use of rabbinic literature as a source - generally, as a historical source - in a number of fields other than literary history, textual philology, or exegesis, such as realia, folklore, and cultural history, in addition to history in the narrower sense.100 Talmudic rabbis made efforts to trace traditions back to their earliest sources.101 Growing segments of the scholarly community in Jewish studies, on the other hand, seem to rely on recent scholarship to filter scholarship of which parallels the earlier nomenclature of "Domestic/Economic Antiquities" (called "daily life" nowadays, cf. below, n. 103). His Synagogale Altertumer corresponds to parts of the field called "Sacral/Religious Antiquities" in earlier centuries, and he planned to publish a separate work on "Political Antiquities" (Politische Altertumer) (see Synagogale Altertumer, vi), which he did not accomplish, but which would have corresponded to sections devoted to this field in older books on biblical/Hebrew archaeology. See above, nn. 13, 18. 99 Under the Lows' influence, a unique school of historical and literary folklore was established in Hungary, represented by Bernard Heller, Adolf Lowinger, Bertalan Kohlbach and others; Alexander Scheiber and Raphael Patai were its last representatives. 100 There were several reasons for this development, and I have dealt with them elsewhere: "Ludwig Blau's Scholarship: Sixty Years After," in L. Blau, The Hebrew Book in Antiquity (reprint edition: Budapest: Logos, 1996), 47-55 (in Hungarian). It is difficult to assess Low's share in this development, in relation to the role played by preexisting local conditions, but consideration must be given to both. Low's influence was spread elsewhere in Europe by graduates and students of the Rabbinical Seminary of Budapest such as Samuel Krauss, Adolf Buchler, and Arthur Marmorstein, who made their careers outside Hungary. 101 fi. Nazir 56b. The Talmud Yerushalmi has a somewhat different approach in this matter, cf. Saul Lieberman, 3) הירושלמי כפשוטוd ed.; New York and Jerusalem: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 2008), 20-21.

The rest is presumed to be self-evident - or self-evidently outdated - and therefore irrelevant. Beyond the common sense and convenience of this attitude, it has problems and shortcomings102 - and I mention here only the most selfish one: much enjoyable and stimulating reading (the writings of Low, for instance) is thrown into the deep sea.103 Appendix: Leopold Low and a Critique of the Hatam Sofer A sarcastic critique of some historical-philological inaccuracies in the first two parts of the Hatam Sofer's responsa, and likewise in a rabbinic work by Shlomo Zalman Ullmann, was published in a Hebrew letter in 1856 in Kerem Chemed.m The contents reveal that the letter - a book review of sorts - was written by a Hungarian scholar; the letter is signed with the acronym YV"M. Bernard Wachstein suggested that the author was Leopold Low, and that the acronym stands for Judah ben Moshe, Low's Hebrew name. Low's authorship "seems to me unquestionable," wrote Wachstein, without producing any evidence.105 Alternative solutions to the 102 This attitude is reminiscent of the post-Talmudic Jewish hilkhetah ke-vatrae principle, or the parallel medieval Christian "dwarfs on the shoulders of giants"-motif. (For literature, see Daniel Sperber, Ways of Pesika: Methods and Approaches for Proper HalakhicDecision Making [Jerusalem: Mas, 2008], 31 n. 51 [in Hebrew].) Both imply, however, full exposure to or acquaintance with all previous scholarship. 103 There are many scholarly publications from recent decades in which one would expect (but does not find) Low's name to be mentioned - only a few of them are referred to above. Of course, it is not my purpose to list such books. Instead, I have tried to make reference to some works which took note of Low's relevant contributions. A recent reference volume - The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Daily Life in Roman Palestine (ed. Catherine Hezser; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), comprising 34 survey articles with brief sections on the history of research and extensive bibliographies - has at least four articles dealing with fields for which not only was Low's work pioneering, but it is still very relevant, indeed indispensable (not to mention the fact that the field itself, "Talmudic archaeology," was his brainchild). While it was obviously not the task of the authors to survey thoroughly the early history of research in their respective fields, one of these chapters does make reference to Low's work: Joshua Schwartz, "Play and Games," 643, 652. The proportions speak for themselves. 104 Kerem Chemed 9 (1856), 75-79. The letter is numbered as no. 14, and has no title. 105 Bernhard Wachstein, Die hebraische Publizistik in Wien, I. Teil (Vienna: Braumiiller, [74*]</page><page sequence="35">Sinai (Tamas) Turan acronym have subsequently been proposed; in view of the lack of compelling direct evidence, the issue of authorship is yet to be settled.106 Internal and circumstantial evidence, however, indicates that Wachstein's identification was correct. (1) A similar mocking criticism (of matters pertaining to the geography of the Holy Land) is voiced later, apropos of another responsum of the Hatam Sofer (in the third volume of his responsa, published subsequently), along with a reference to other "amusing" grammatical, philological and historical curiosa that can be found in his responsa collections.107 (2) The dichotomous terminology of "progressives" and "conservatives," used by Low elsewhere in that same year (1856), appears also in the letter in question.108 (3) Another article by Low appeared in the same volume of Kerem Chemed. (4) Low used pseudonyms elsewhere.109 This cumulative evidence, while does not amount to decisive proof, strongly supports Low's authorship of the piece. 1930), 121. Wachstein adds that he asked Immanuel Low about his paternal grandfather's name; but he is conspicuously silent as to whether he inquired about the authorship of the article itself. Low's bibliography (GS 5:3-19, probably compiled by I. Low) does not make reference to this article. 106 Pelli, Kerem Hemed, 108-10. Pelli is equivocal on the question of authorship, see 108-9 nn. 488-89. The author of a recent article on this critique announces a forthcoming paper in which he is going to present evidence for Low's authorship: Natan David Rabinowitz, "הגנת מרן החתם סופר זצ"ל מביקורתו של היב"ם", Kovetz Etz Hayyim 4/1 (5770/2009-2010): 225 η. 3. The article is yet to be published. 107 "Die Orthodoxie und das Rabbiner-Seminar," 454-55; cf. R. Moshe Sofer, שרית חתם סופר, Even ha-ezer Part 2 (Pressburg, 1859/1860), no. 49. In principle it is possible of course - although not very likely - that Low was not the author of the pseudonymous article but knew it and alludes to it by mentioning the grammatical, philological and historical "curiosa." It should be noted that the same criticism (without the reference to other "curiosa") was voiced by Low almost two years previously, in "Aron Chorin," 34. (The reference to the Hatam Sofer responsum is given there [on 42 n. 7 (read: n. 6)], erroneously). Interestingly, this latter passage is deleted in the republication of the article in GS 2:270, while its expanded (and more severe) version is retained in GS 4 ("Die Orthodoxie"), as noted. This - for the time being, lone - example of editorial censorship warrants some caution in using GS. The lack of a foreword in GS (on the basis of editorial policy) gives the editor partial immunity from accountability. 108 Kerem Chemed 9 (1856): 78; cf. nn. 8 and 59 above. The terms are used as loanwords, written in Hebrew characters; the explanatory phrase, "asher la-lekhet metivim," an equivalent of "mehallekhim," is added to "progressivim." 109 For examples, see above, nn. 57, 59.
