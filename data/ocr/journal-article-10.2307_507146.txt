<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOUILLES REICENTES A KHIROKITIA (CHYPRE) 1988- 1991, edited by Alain LeBrun. Pp. 422, pls. 47, figs. 65, plans 44, maps 2, tables 34. Editions recherche sur les civilisations, Paris 1994. ISBN 2-86538-247-8. This is the third major volume by Alain LeBrun and his colleagues on the Aceramic Neolithic settlement of Khirokitia. So important is this site that the Aceramic Neo- lithic in Cyprus often is called the Khirokitia Culture. Khir- okitia, originally excavated by Porphyrios Dikaios, has been the ongoing focus of the LeBrun team since 1977, making it the best-documented site of the Khirokitia Culture in Cyprus. Like the previous volumes, this well-packaged monograph contains a wealth of new information based on excavations from 1988 to 1991, concentrating on the eastern sector of the settlement. The first two chapters discuss stratigraphy and radio- carbon chronology. Chapters 3-9, written by LeBrun and dealing with architecture and the use of space, are the most innovative in this volume, and although some may disagree with LeBrun's interpretations, his careful analyses deserve careful consideration. Chapters 8 and 9, concerned with domestic space usage and the spatial organization of the village, are particularly interesting. Chapters 10-12 treat various aspects of the human re- mains: they are described in chapter 10, while chapter 11</page><page sequence="2">630 BOOK NOTES deals with associated stone vessels and chapter 12 consid- ers burial pollen. The next three chapters describe arti- factual materials, focusing on small objects and nonchipped stone (ch. 13); of particular interest are the enigmatic incised cobbles, found only at Khirokitia and Kholetria Ortos, another Aceramic Neolithic village. Chapter 14 dis- cusses anthropomorphic representations and chapter 15 describes a small piece of woven textile. The remaining four chapters deal with flora and fauna. Although the 1988-1991 excavations recovered abundant fauna, no new species occur; the increased sample size, however, has allowed a better definition of the site's faunal composition (ch. 16). There follow two contributions presenting data on fish remains (ch. 17) and shellfish (ch. 18) from another important Aceramic Neolithic site previously excavated by LeBrun, Cap Andreas Kastros, and demonstrating the importance of these marine resources; while out of place in this volume, these chapters are nonetheless importante additions to the palaeoeconomic literature for prehistoric Cyprus. The final chapter (19) is a report on plant remains: emmer and einkorn wheat, barley, and lentils apparently were the principal cultivars; an olive pit and a fruit or nut also were recovered. A brief rectification by LeBrun con- cludes the volume. While one still awaits detailed reports on the chipped stone, and although some of the chapters are brief, this is a welcome addition to investigations on the Aceramic Neolithic of Cyprus. Still lacking for the island is an in- tegrative interpretation of the Neolithic, but that is beyond the scope of what, essentially, is a partial site report out- lining some of the most careful and innovative research focusing on the early prehistory of Cyprus.
