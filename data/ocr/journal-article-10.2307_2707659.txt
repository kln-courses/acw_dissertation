<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XVI NUMBER 2 APRIL, 1955 GEORGE HAKEWILL: THE VIRILITY OF NATURE BY RONALD W. HEPBURN Adam's world, once contaminated by sin, no longer produced abundantly, became inhospitable and cheerless. "Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee." St. Paul saw nature not only as inflicting punitive discomfort upon man, but also suffering in its own life as a result of the Fall, a fall of cosmic extent: no less than "the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain ... . 2 It yearns and struggles for a lost perfection. Since the entire universe is corrupted, Christ dies to redeem, not man alone, but the cosmos as a whole. The theme is taken up once more in the final book of the New Testament, and presented in visionary tableaux; the world which sin has spoiled is to be fashioned anew-a new heaven and a new earth; for the old, so sadly marred, shall pass away. For all this, it cannot be said that the Bible presents consistently and unequivocally a doctrine of a Cosmic Fall. If nature can stand as symbol of human wickedness, it can also reveal the glory and un- diminished fecundity of the Creator whose handiwork it is. "The heavens declare the glory of God;"3 God "maketh the clouds his chariot and walketh upon the wings of the wind," 4 not only in the days of Adam's innocence, but also since Fall and Flood. There remains in the world an orderliness, a stability, a guarantee of con- tinued divine care: "While the earth remaineth, seedtime and har- vest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease." 5 A theologian who sought to systematize " the Biblical doctrine of the Fall" could therefore adduce evidence both for and against the wholesale corruption of the world at man's fall, or its subsequent decay. Inevitably disagreements arose among interpretations, be- tween belief in the virility of nature and in its contamination through sin: differences too (among those who admitted a Cosmic Fall) over the extent of the actual damage caused to the non-human world. Controversy over these issues reached a remarkable vehemence in early seventeenth-century England. Not only philosophers and theologians debated the subject strenuously, but the imagery and arguments of the debate caught the literary and popular imagination also. The description of cosmic catastrophe gave full scope to the dynamic, often rumbustious, vocabulary of Elizabethan and Jacobean poetry and prose. To Fulke Greville, for instance, the whole earth is "making haste to her last declination." 6 A hush has descended upon it like the shocked silence in a drawing-room after a child has uttered an unforgivably bad word. 1 Genesis 3.18. 2 Romans 8.22. 3 Psalm 19.1. 4 Psalm 104.3. 5 Genesis 8 22. 6 Greville, Works (edited by Grosart), II, 30. 135</page><page sequence="2">136 RONALD W. HEPBURN Thy powerfull lawes, Thy wonders of creation, Thy word incarnate, glorious heauen, darke hell, Lye shadowed vnder man's degeneration.7 In Goodman's even more picturesque prose:-" when the hangings and furniture are taken down, it is a token that the king and the court are removing; Nature now beginning to decay." s In this period believers in a Cosmic Fall supplemented the Bibli- cal account of sin and its effects by a large variety of related ideas. One source of these was the " Hexaemeral Literature "-esoteric com- mentaries on Genesis-whose chronology gave reason to expect an imminent end of the world and provided an arithmetical backing to the idea that the world was in its old age. That classical view of history, in which Gold, Silver, Bronze and Iron Ages succeed one another could readily be grafted on to a Christian Cosmic Fall doctrine, providing an imaginative framework for the idea of post- Fall deterioration. Again, the Ideas or Forms of Plato are often given place in Cosmic Fall theories as ideal norms, existent some- where and somehow, compared with which the fallen world we know is a pale and corroded copy. The Augustinian conception of evil as privatio (rooted ultimately in Aristotle) and the Aristotelian notion of opposition between "contrary" elements were eminently adapt- able; 9 for what was the world's decay but the privation of that "vertue " by which God had cherished it in its first fresh glory; and what hypothesis could be more serviceable in accounting for its mutability, its restless vicissitudes, than that of instability in the elements themselves? One did not need to be an "atomist " or atheist to borrow some helpful ideas even from Lucretius. Although Donne would have vigorously denied that the universe originated in a "fortuitous con- course of atoms," he could yet declare, as a believer in nature's decay, that the world "is crumbled out againe to his Atomies." 10 In 1616 the controversy reached a peak with the publication of Godfrey Goodman's The Fall of Man, or the Corruption of Nature, Proved by the Light of our Naturall Reason. This most detailed defense of the Cosmic Fall doctrine instanced a vast variety of phenomena as cases of decline and decay." Among them are the 7 Ibid., III, 142. 8 Godfrey Goodman, The Fall of Man, or the Corruption of Nature Proved by the Light of our Naturall Reason (1616), 385. 9 Augustine, Enchiridion, section 11ff.; SPCK edition (1953) pp. 8ff.

All nature is "directed to man ; 14 therefore, should man sin, "it stood with the uniformity of Gods judgments that nothing should remain untouched, no not the elements them- selves." 15 Opposition to theories of a Cosmic Fall was slower in maturing. Bacon's distrust of the testimony of the ancients permitted him (and those who increasingly followed him) to ignore those compar- isons, beloved of Goodman, between the men of his own day and the "giants" of the past; and with them the deterioration of metals analogy which stood awkwardly in the way of a philosophy of prog- ress.16 The question of degeneration through sin was thus a central issue in the " Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns." To decide whether the men of today were or were not morally and intellectu- ally inferior to the ancients was to decide not only a theological, theoretical crux, but had a practical bearing upon the possibilities of cultural and scientific advance in the future for the "relief of man's estate:" '1 On the other hand, the champions of the "Moderns," despite their optimism when compared with believers in degenera- tion, did not harp upon the sole string of man's unlimited power, dignity and uniqueness. For instance, the possibility of life on other worlds as discussed in a work like John Wilkins' The Discovery of a New World was one of numerous seventeenth-century challenges to the idea of human uniqueness; but was made the ground not for a belittlement of man and lessening of hope for the present and future, but for the overthrow of the belief that human sin must corrode the entire fabric of the universe. A Cosmic Fall was much less probable if the cosmos was not the nursery of mankind alone.l8 12 Goodman provides excellent examples of the " filth and pollution " imagery discussed recently in this Journal (by Roland Mushat Frye [April 1954]) in con- nection with Swift's picture of sinful man in the Yahoos! 13 Goodman, op. cit., 16f. 14Ibid., 14. 15 Ibid., 280. 16See, for Bacon's distrust of the adulation of the ancients, The Philosophical Works of Francis Bacon (edited by J.

HEPBURN To many, as the century progressed, the world seemed less and less the derelict ruin it was to Goodman. The new science gave ever fresh insights into its beauty and design. Henry Power in his Ex- perimental Philosophy (1664) and John Ray at the end of the cen- tury were both far more keenly aware of The Wonders of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation than of any flaws sin might have introduced. For a succinct and forthright denial of nature's decay we may take Pierre Bayle's statement, " le peche originel n'a pas trouble l'harmonie [de la Nature]." Comets are no portents, and indeed the whole complex of beliefs which supported any interpre- tation of cosmic phenomena as repercussions of the human situation can be called in question: "la mort ou la naissance d'un Prince est une si petite affaire eu egard a toute la nature des choses, que ce n'est pas la peine qu'on s'en remue dans le Ciel." 19 Goodman's thesis, however, did not have to wait till the end of the century for a serious and thorough reply. In 1627 George Hake- will published his Apologie of the Power and Providence of God in the Government of the World, a work of 473 pages at its first ap- pearance and considerably augmented in subsequent editions (1630 and 1635). As one might expect, a fair part of the work is devoted to the citation of instances of virility in nature and progress in things human; but Hakewill was perceptive enough to see that he and Goodman both could amass examples sufficient to give plausibility to either view, but that this method alone could be conclusive to neither. To defeat his opponent, he had not only to outnumber Goodman's cases of decay with samples of fecundity, but establish a new way of looking at the whole world, in the light of which the thousands of un-instanced items that the reader would subsequently encounter could also be seen as undecayed, fresh from the mint of creation. How in fact he did this is the question which the present study will attempt to answer. But before embarking upon it, something must briefly be said about the approach I have adopted. To produce an "inventory " of the materials used by the protagonists in a controversy, to trace their sources and influence, provides the historian of ideas with a task of considerable size and importance. With many enquiries such a cata- logue more or less exhausts the possibilities of research in that par- ticular field. But the less the works concerned resemble encyclopedic collections of ideas and the more they possess an organic unity of their own, the more inadequate such a method becomes. The ex- treme case is, of course, that of a lyric poem whose logical structure and literary worth cannot begin to be assessed from an enumeration 19 Quoted in Paul Hazard, La Crise de la Conscience Europeenne, I, 208, 211.</page><page sequence="5">HAKEWILL: THE VIRILITY OF NATURE 139 of its mere " content " as represented by a prose summary. Now, my suggestion is that Hakewill's Apologie deserves study not solely as a notable repository of arguments and ideas about nature's decay or vigor, but also as an imaginative literary work which employs the resources of language in a way not so very different from that of a poem which seeks to communicate a world-view and enlists every possible linguistic device to further this task. The total impact Hakewill makes upon his reader depends only partly (as hinted above) upon his accumulated instances of virility, still less upon cogent formal arguments, but above all on the effect of his insistent images of rebirth and restoration, the pervasive vo- cabulary of enlightenment, discovery and growth to mature per- fection: it depends equally upon his adroit control of meaning in key terms like " nature," his skillful orchestration of ancient authorities, and upon his unremitting attack on the quasi-diagrammatic con- ception of man as microcosm, which had given such firm backing to belief in decay. Hakewill's principal aim is to lead his reader from the contemplation of particular undecayed vivacious items in the world to a vision of the world itself as virile and constantly rejuve- nated. To investigate the linguistic machinery which enables him to do this requires as much a literary and stylistic analysis as a logical one. It is such a literary analysis I wish to offer in what follows, a sketch of the way Hakewill marshalled and employed the conceptual materials and imagery available to him. 1. HAKEWILL'S APPROACH TO HIS THEME Hakewill speaks as a preacher with a preacher's task-to promote the "glory of God," "knowledge and vertue." The doctrine of the world's decay strikes at all three. It "rather tends to make men worse then better, . . . rather to breed sloath then to quicken indus- try." 20 Spineless and irreligious resignation, abandonment of effort are inevitable results of the doctrine's outworking in the imagina- tion. Hakewill is very much alive to the impact a theory may have in practical affairs, and blurs the distinction between the practically desirable and the theoretically valid. "Certainely the force of im- agination is wonderfull, ...." "Prognostications and Prophesies often helpe to further that which they foretell, .... 21 Men who mistakenly see in the stars omens of disaster, "by means of their very feare ... fall into that which they stand in feare of." 22 On the other hand, his researches and meditations upon God's power and providence have had upon him a healthful effect which he would gladly share with his reader: 23 . . . how other men may stand 20 Apologie of the Power and Providence of God (1627), 18. 21 Ibid., 17. 22 101. 23 Preface.</page><page sequence="6">140 RONALD W. HEPBURN affected in reading, I know not, sure I am that in writing, it often lifted vp my soule in admiring and praysing the infinite wisedom and bounty of the Cr[e]ator ... in the government and preservation of the Vniverse." Optimism, however, must not be ungoverned, re- quires controlling. To check the danger of hybris, which his own reading of the world's non-decay might beget, he adds a substantial final section upon the end of the world and the judgment to come. Neither the influence of the heavens nor an inevitable decline of nature must enforce a fatalistic apathy. The world ends not with a whimper but with a bang, a dramatic conclusion for which a man may be devoutly prepared. To believe in " decay" is to cease self- preparation; it is to resign oneself to seeing the world as a dreary ruin, a stopping clock, a flywheel gradually coming to rest, its power- supply long cut off. All this could be called, not too fancifully, a "moral argument " in the sense in which Kant claimed that an examination of morality must lead to the postulating of God and immortality; for if neither exists, on Kant's view, the moral imperative would be a mockery. So Hakewill seeks to exhibit the virility of nature and the last judg- ment as similar postulates, since only by belief in these can men at once obtain encouragement in the moral life and be restrained from levity. The opinion of Hakewill's day strongly supported the belief he was attacking. He had the hard task of arguing against the cur- rent of popular lore and fashionable wisdom. Resolutely, therefore, at the outset he submits his readers to a preliminary bombardment by instances, not of virility or decay but of "pseudodoxia " of all kinds, exposing the untrustworthiness of current opinion in general, a "softening-up" renewed from time to time in the course of the book.24 Even within the doctrine of decay strains are manifest. Is decay due to Adam's sin or simply to deterioration in the material of the world through the passage of time? His opponents (many of them) wish to have it both ways-" a manifest and irreconciliable contradiction." 25 The ancients confidently derided the fable of the antipodes: now "time and travell haue . . . discovered the con- trary." 26 There is a vein of tough-minded scepticism in Hakewill which he enlists at convenient moments against the overcredulity of the enemy -an ambivalent weapon which might well have hurt its master. Eclipses, for example, are no more dangerous than night, for each is merely the shadow of a heavenly body shutting out the sun's light.

THE CITATION OF INSTANCES Space does not permit the systematic discussion of Hakewill's instances of non-decay. Some were much more controversial than others. He had an easy case in arguing for the supremacy of renais- sance astronomy, navigation, science generally and perhaps morals over those of the ancients. The interesting cases are those which Hakewill wrests from the opposition, reinterprets to his own require- ments. The moon was allegedly decayed,28 for its surface was marred with "blemishes." So was it in Plutarch's time, Hakewill replies. Our telescopes are merely bringing the blemishes to our notice more than previously; otherwise there is no change. Longevity was neces- sary in former ages, so that the earth might speedily be "re- plenished," 29 and that the lives of scholars might be commensurate with their tasks, when so much was to be discovered. To give the world a good start, Hakewill was prepared to add that the influence of the stars was specially propitious in early times. But the key word is " special," and the absence of longevity today is an indication not of decay but only of the resuming of the status quo. Psalm 102, often employed as a Biblical authority for decay,30 speak- ing of the earth and the heavens, says " all of them shall wax old as doth a garment." Upon this phrase Hakewill executes some specu- lation. To him the heavens' garment simile refers not to the " wear and tear " of the heavens, but only to the fact of their "spreading." The awkward phrase says, therefore, nothing more than that the earth and heavens shall "vanish and passe away" at the world's end.3' Were the Romans braver than we today? No, says Hakewill, they had an appearance of bravery, but their warlike aims were corrupt and thus remove all merit from their exploits. "... if the Romanes cannot shew vs by what right they conquered the world, wee will neuer call their strength in conquering it, Fortitude, or crowne it with the name of Vertue ...." 32 Hakewill here tacitly redefines " bravery" as " bravery in the pursuit of a good cause (compare later his similar redefinition of "growth " as "growth-to- perfection ") a move which enables him to deflate a considerable part of the ancients' prestige and evade their challenge to his own day. 27 142. 28 74. 2936. 30 Godfrey Goodman, The Fall of Man.. ., 378. 31 Apologie, 71f. 32 b., 418.</page><page sequence="8">142 RONALD W. HEPBURN The citation of authorities has an important part in the Apologie. Hakewill plays upon them with skill and often considerable daring. For instance, numerous exposures of the corruption of Roman life are themselves drawn from Latin authors, yet they are so handled as to avoid the question of revaluation of the period in the light of the wisdom of those same authorities in their own day. They speak with Hakewill's voice, aloof, disengaged from their own period. Others, like Plato, are Janus-headed. In cosmology he is "the divine Plato "; in the Republic the fount of " impious and dishonest lawes." 3 The authorities serve his turn, but he is committed to none. He selects with the scissors, and the final pattern is his own. Hakewill makes clever persuasive use of the concept of stand- point. The "higher" the viewpoint (or, the larger the visible area of canvas), the more clearly can the topography or design be seen as a whole. And Hakewill is sure (so sure that he merely asserts this without argument) that the high viewpoint, the synoptic vision, reveal not decay but preservation and vigour of life. His presup- position is that there always is a design to be seen. If we observe a mountain being eroded by wind and rain, then do not cry " decay." Rather, get higher and see a new piece of coast being laid down miles away or an alluvial plain, rich for the plough. The decay protagonist is like a man who, studying the " end of a peece of Arras, conceiues perhaps an hand or head which he sees to be very vnartificially made." 34 If he troubles to unfold "the whole, [he] soone finds that it carries a due and iust proportion to the body." Such is the momentum of Hakewill's world-view, that his reader is coaxed by the use of imagery like this into the presumption that all apparent decay-even in the absence of any evidence-is only a cycle of growth, decline, rebirth, seen imperfectly-that is, from too low a standpoint. When a man starts studying the nature of self-knowledge, he soon finds a perplexing "regressiveness" in the self, an elusiveness, an inability to get outside his own skin and observe himself. The self that does the observing is always part of the self one is trying to examine. One is always on the brink of an infinite regress of " selves." In the freewill controversy, the libertarian often attempts to wriggle free from outer and inner determinism by exclaiming, "Maybe my character is the product of a, b, c, .. . n; but the real 'I' (regressing a step) can act in opposition to all influences if I choose .... ." It is hard to convince the defender of a naive meta- physical freedom that this "self" which stands back may be con- sidered as part of what is meant by his "character," that total self- 33 288. 84 96.</page><page sequence="9">HAKEWILL: THE VIRILITY OF NATURE 143 transcendence is illusory. Now Hakewill employs this "obliging regressiveness of 'I'," as we may call it, in insisting that decline, if there is a decline, is the result of human sloth, not of any irresistible principle of decay: ". .. let vs then lay the fault where it is, and accuse ourselues, . .. 35 If .. . we come short of our Auncestors, . .. let vs not impute it to the declination of the World, but to the malice and faintnesse of our owne wills." 36 He quotes approvingly Cardinal Poole's remark that "whatsoever was portended by the figure of his birth, or naturall generation, was cancelled and altered, by the grace of his second birth, or regeneration in the bloud of his Redemer " (sic).37 This too is assertion, not argument, but assertion which is given plausibility by the regressiveness of the self. The pattern of decay could be represented diagrammatically by an inclined plane, or in some views a convex slope "hasting to its last declination." This pattern Hakewill does his best to break up, upsetting the rhythm of it, removing its smoothness, substituting sudden irregularities, peaks and valleys for the line or curve of dec- lination. All his many appeals to divine intervention (considered below with his views on Nature) can be seen as interruptions of the pattern. Equally so is the insistence upon the suddenness of the Flood and the Last Judgment. ".. . wee reade of no ... forerunning declination which was the reason that men took no notice of it [the flood] till it overtooke them, and as it was then, so shall it be at the sudden, and vnexpected comming of the second deluge of fire." 38 De- vout souls have been mistaken about the pattern of history before now. Christians of the first centuries misinterpreted those passages in the New Testament "which speake of the second comming of Christ, as if it had beene then hard at hand." 3 But despite Cyprian's eloquent discourse on the world's old age as seen in the calamities of his time,40 "it pleased Almighty God to pacifie those stormes ... by the conversion of the renowned Constantine ... as it had beene by the breaking forth of the Sunbeames .... 2 41 So Hake- will loosens his readers' confidence in well-established patterns, and begets in him a receptivity to his own. The geological instance of eroded-hills-becoming-fertile-plain serves Hakewill as an analogy, a thought-model, which underlies many of his more fanciful speculations. Balance, restoration, redis- tribution, reciprocity are ideas felt often in the Apologie, even when not explicitly mentioned. Arts suffer periodical declines, but reap- pear in full strength sooner or later; so too civilizations, science and religion. But in other places the thought-model is less of a cycle 35 Preface. 36 Epistle Dedicatory. 37 99. 38 42f. 39 51f. 40 Quoted 50f. 41 52.</page><page sequence="10">144 RONALD W. HEPBURN than a spiral-a spiral of progress. Not only is there no decay, but the reverse is true, a slow but significant improvement in the world's condition. The elements "decay in their parts, but so as by a reciprocall compensation they both loose and gaine . . ..42 But " the World in former ages hath beene plagued with more droughts, . . . famines, earthquakes, pestilences . . . then in latter times." 43 Certain of the arts "decayed, and againe revived with greater perfection: Others were neuer in their perfection till now." 44 3. NATURE IN THE "APOLOGIE Seventeenth-century ideas of nature among the religiously ortho- dox had a remarkable flexibility within what might seem at first glance a rigid framework. The two heretical extremes-the Scylla and Charybdis between which orthodoxy steered-were the pantheis- tic identification of God with nature, on the one side, and the total independence of the two, on the other. Supporters of the doctrine of decay tended to represent the relation God/nature as a loose one, setting God's stability and righteousness in the strongest contrast with human and terrestrial degeneration. Unhealthily loose, Hake- will thought. As he saw it, the closer God and nature could be brought, the less danger of postulating a running-down universe: the smaller the gap for His life-giving rejuvenating spark to travel. Re- peatedly Hakewill so employs language, so modifies the senses of his crucial expressions, as expressly to draw in the slack, to bind nature firmly to God's throne. There is no simple or single answer to the question "How is this general up-grading of nature related (logi- cally) to the individual instances of non-decay in Hakewill's Apologie? " Numerous as they are, the instances cannot themselves give him warrant for the theological generalization; but, as they are successively expounded, they certainly make more and more probable a non-empirical equation like " Nature a tool in God's own hand ": the vision of nature as God's power in action sends Hakewill back to the phenomena again, expectant for new signs of fecundity and vigor. On page 171 of the Apologie Hakewill says, ". . . as God and Nature, (or rather God by Nature, his instrument and handmaid) hath" etc .... Here we can see the tightening-up of God/nature relations before our eyes. " God and nature " implies a duality; the two could slip apart. Nature like a glider released from its towing aircraft, could "decline." Therefore Hakewill corrects himself and writes " rather God by Nature . . .." God's own direct action, that is, is everywhere apparent. The four elements, "as a musical instru- 42 28. 43 31. 44 247. 45 38; cf. 107.</page><page sequence="11">HAKEWILL: THE VIRILITY OF NATURE 145 ment of foure strings, [are] both tuned and touched by the hand of heaven." 45 An even more direct revaluation of nature occurs very early in the work. "That which the Samaritans ignorantly and blasphe- mously spake of Symon Magus, may properly and truly bee spoken of Nature, that it is the Great power of God."46 Hakewill does not by any means always equate nature and the power of God. But even when he speaks of intermediaries between them, he throws out recurrent hints that the noblest ingredients in the natural world come very near to partaking of God's own nature. Light, notably, being a messenger between heaven and earth, can be "no more subject to decay or old age, then the Angells are." The first created of the visible creatures, light " comes neerest the nature of a Spirit." 47 The heavens, of whose non-decay he is convinced, indeed declare the glory of God, as the Psalmist said. Should they have been found decayed, then certainly the earth should not escape " declination." "... as likewise on the other side, if there be found no decay in the Heauens, the presumption will be strong that there is no such decay here either.48 Moreover, the heavens are "intermediate Agents, or secondary Causes, betweene himselfe (God) and the lower " world.49 Their mediation is delicately described, without any suggestion that the earth is in the least degree out of touch with the Almighty. Rather, such splendid mediators level up the earth to God, instead of implying isolation or remoteness from Him. To sum up; Nature is in the closest possible relation to God: but all natural activities are not divine activities, and God is not pre- cluded from acting in the world in a special (miraculous) manner. This He does not infrequently, and Hakewill posits divine interven- tion in many places where his opponents posit "natural" events before decay set in. Seasonal weather has not altered observably since ancient times, " at leastwise in regard of the ordinary course of nature. For of Gods extraordinary judgments, we now dispute not, who sometimes for our sinnes emptieth the botles of heaven inces- santly vpon vs."50 Giants were miraculous creations: so was the "new star" seen at the birth of Christ, and for the more recent "new star " of 1572. If (which Hakewill doubts) eclipses are harm- ful, then, should their damage be reparable, the cycles of time will repair it; if irreparable, the ensuing decay must not be thought of as "natural" but as the supernatural result of a special cause. Similarly, the present barrenness of Palestine must not be considered as a natural declination from its fertility in Biblical times. No, its 46 15. 47 86f. Cf. Plotinus on light; Enn.

Hakewill thus has it both ways: nature is close enough to God to prevent systematic decay; not so close as to be a constant exhibition of special Provi- dences. Hakewill breaks up the " decline" graph by allotting awk- ward events to the miraculous, without suggesting that the remainder is dross.1 There is a strong tint of rationalism in the Apologie. In more than one important argument Hakewill rephrases a question of em- pirical investigation as a matter of a priori elucidation. " Is there any decay and corruption in the world?" becomes "it cannot, I thinke be well conceiued why hee [God] should ordaine or admit such a ... vniversall and irrecouerable consumption."52 " Are the heavens decayed?" is transformed into:-Are they "in a naturall course . . . capable of such a supposed decay? "3 Or again, the heavenly bodies are moved by angels, and therefore cannot decay. "Has the supply of heat from the sun diminished?" The real question is whether it could, in Hakewill's words, " be capable of any such diminution or no." Heat from the heavenly bodies is the result, not of their warmth, for this might indeed dwindle, but of their light, which being so close to the nature of spirit, cannot diminish. "Are there influences from the sun, moon and stars? " Ask rather: Could God have created so noble a roof to the world and given it no function to perform? Influences they must have, otherwise "one of the worthiest peeces [of the cosmos would be] voyde of action, the chief end of every created being." 54 We are not at the mercy of mere ob- servation in assessing the evidence for nature's non-decay. We could argue for it with our eyes shut. In this way Hakewill gives a sense of analytical self-evidence to his exposition at crucial points. Re- member his belief that the question of the earth's decay was closely related to the possibility of decay in the heavens. Having shown a priori the incorruptibility of the latter, his main task is very much lightened in consequence, and his empirical instances become less pieces of indispensable evidence than useful but not essential ex- amples of a principle otherwise established. 4. LINGUISTIC SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS, IMAGERY AND ANALOGY Much of this paper has already been concerned with Hakewill's use of language, but something more explicit must now be said upon the manner in which his thesis is given extra force by his alertness to hostile imagery and his employment (to what degree conscious we cannot say) of analogies, metaphors and images that reinforce the trend of the argument proper. 51 74, 143. 52 14. 53 67. 54 97.</page><page sequence="13">HAKEWILL: THE VIRILITY OF NATURE 147 Only in part is his aim the communication of information; more important is his invitation to see the old world in a new way-a conversion of attitude, which is the final objective of the entire work. The cumulative effect of images, consistently handled, backs up the results of formal argumentation, works on the reader even when off his guard, builds up in him a frame of mind in which the ideas of the world's fecundity, richness and vigor appear quite incontestable, even uncontroversial. It is commonly observed that time " eates out and devoures all things "; but this, to Hakewill, is "in truth but a poeticall fiction ...." Time is not an active principle.65 An image favorable to the decay protagonist is carefully "debunked." (Nonetheless, Hakewill himself says of time, when it suits him, that "it strengthens the dictates of Nature and Trueth." 56) In the same way, he rejects the analogy between nature and women. Once this analogy is granted, it becomes indisputable that as the one enjoys youth and fertility, then suffers a decline to barrenness and old age, so does the other. But Hakewill denies that the cycle of growth, maturity and senes- cence, proper to mankind, is in any way applicable to "super- naturally created Nature " itself,-the very point at issue. Eliminate this all-pervasive figure, and the decay theme loses much of its plausibility. Hakewill, however, retains elements of the analogy, its sting removed, and compares in countless instances human fertility at its best with nature's unabated fertility. Of this more below. He vehemently attacks the legend of the ages of the world, the decline from Gold to Iron. If the use of this imagery is allowed, then once more decay is incontrovertible. It is uncritically employed by most educated Englishmen. Hakewill makes it his business to challenge it. Throughout the Apologie images which reinforce its thesis are neatly selected and often contrasted with the rival image which would point to decay. A clear example of this occurs in his exegesis of " as a vesture shalt thou change them." 57 The heavens shall be changed, "Not by scowring off of contracted rust, but adding a new glosse and augmentation of glory." 58 Images of fecundity, most frequently of sexual fecundity, are so numerous as to impart a color to the whole work. Trees and flowers "suck their nourishment from (the earth) as so many infants from 55 27; cf. Preface and 245. 56 Preface. 57 Psalm 102. 58 Apologie, 73f. It is interesting to observe that the paragraph which this sentence ends is used almost verbatim (without acknowledgement) by Thomas Vaughan, in his Natural History 16f. (Quoted in Theology [April 1953], 142 in a sermon by S. L. Bethell.)</page><page sequence="14">148 RONALD W. HEPBURN their mothers breast." 59 No decay has forced plants to starve at nature's breast.60 Of the ocean, Hakewill says "The mother of waters, the great deepe hath vndoubtedly lost nothing of her ancient bounds ... the vapours which the Sunne drawes vp, empty them- selues againe into her bosome." 61 The seas are anything but barren. The time of gestation has not altered in human beings, nor conse- quently should there be any alteration in the length of human life, before our "returne to the wombe of [our] common mother the earth." 62 Unploughed fields "retaine their virginity." 6 Words like "vertue," "fatness," "fruitfulness " are to be found on almost every page. All these may be considered as special cases of the principle of "plenitude." The doctrine of decay suggests that God was of a "niggardly and sparing disposition." 64 If it is true, the world is not so rich, so full, as it might have been. It is worth observing that Hakewill does not confine his fecundity images to sections of his book in which he is specially arguing for fertility against decline. It appears, apparently by chance, in many places where other images would have been equally appropriate. "Bvt happily it may be said, that as fertile grounds abound in weedes as wholesome hearbes: so the Romanes had many vertues no lesse commendable . . . ." 5 By this scattering of images Hakewill contrives to steep the Apologie in a sense of lush green growth, moist and infinitely fertile. Allied to this group of images is the imagery of new birth and new life. Hakewill's object is to "free the world from old age." 66 The elements " by continuall generation each out of other renew their parts." 67 Medicine was " borne ,againe " under Galen.68 The " slum- bering drowzie spirit of the Grecians began againe to be revived and awakened." 69 " Luther arose and awakened the world." 70 Anthropomorphic figures for nature and natural phenomena are plentiful, all expressing virility and unquenchable youth. We read of the " vigour " of sunbeams, the " good behaviour " of the elements, of an earth blessed with youth and fruitfulness.71 Other images describe the revealing of the hidden. The appre- hension of truth helps us to regain and "repaire " the image of God in man. The "fruite of . . . doctrine lay hidde under the leaues ... 72 The discovery of the compass enables mariners to find a way "thorow the vast Ocean, in the greatest stormes and darkest nights ... ." 73 When discussing ancient and modern architecture, Hakewill tells of an obelisk " which in the yeare 1586 was raised by the direction of Dominicus Fontana." Its size is the only relevant point of comparison, rivalling the stones of the pyramids.

Those images have much in common with the last two groups I mean to discuss:-" enlargement" and "growth to perfection." Medicine in recent years has been "inlarged and beautified . . . en- riched . . . ."75 Through modern explorations "euery creeke and corner of the habitable World " has been investigated.76 Hakewill's chapter on navigation begins with a picture of the world of the ancients, restricted, bounded by the shores of the Mediterranean, and it ends with Drake's circumnavigation of the entire world and a reference to a " learned Treatise of Celestiall &amp; terrestriall Globes." 77 Here too the cumulative impact of the imagery is increased by in- cidental employment of words like " expand," " open up ": Hakluyt's voyages, for example, have been " lately inlarged &amp; perfected." 78 In comparing ancient and modern poets Hakewill selects, as examples of the former, bad memorial epigrams, sepulchral both in situation and tone: his last quotation from later, improved writing tells hap- pily of poetry advanced to the " highest pitch "; 79 the previous geo- graphical limits to the vigor of poetry have been removed and set ever further and further away from its Mediterranean source. Of the Scholastics Hakewill says, using the same imagery of restriction fol- lowed by release and expansion,-they kept men "in the porch " of learning, "that they entred not into the house." 80 We have seen how large a part is played by images of fertility and growth. Some uses of " growth " imagery are, however, unfavor- able to the attitude Hakewill wishes to beget in his reader, and are seen by him as enemies. On page 5 he vehemently rejects the view that life is a steady loss of energy, a running-down from the moment of conception, a wasting away of a candle or taper. True growth, therefore, is redefined by Hakewill as " growth-to-perfection." Augus- tine may be right in comparing the ages of the world to the ages of man's life, but to speak of the present as the world's old age is not to pronounce the world decrepit. Its age is of indeterminate length, and this may well be the period of its greatest virility. Distance from origin does not mean decrease in vigor. Compare a painter's first "rude draught" with the finished work perfected-through-growth. In " nature " falling bodies accelerate, do not lose speed, as they fall; the analogy between the deceleration of an " arrow " or " dart " with increased height and distance from the thrower, and the supposed decay of the world is unsound, true of " violent" motions, but most untrue of " naturall motions " like the motion of a falling stone.81 74 249. 75 231. 76 234. 77 250-4. 78 253. 79 240. 80 244. 81 49.</page><page sequence="16">150 RONALD W. HEPBURN 5. SUMMARY The foregoing analysis has had a dual purpose:-(1) a brief ex- position of the contents of Hakewill's Apologie, and (2) an elucida- tion of his modes of argumentation and expression. The emphasis of the paper has rested upon the latter rather than the former; for though there exist good accounts of the subject-matter of the book, the complex, near-poetic use of metaphor, imagery and analogy in the Apologie has not received the attention it merits. (1) Hakewill denies that the heavens are decayed or that the earth is less hospitable to man, less fertile, than before the Fall. Between Ancients and Moderns no decline is observable. (2) But he realizes that the controversy is empirically unsettl- able; the bandying back and forth of instances could continue in- definitely and inconclusively. Other types of argument and other persuasive techniques are therefore invoked, among them the follow- ing:-(a) A "moral argument" is used against decay theorists: to believe in a Cosmic Fall and subsequent degeneration saps energy, hope and virtue. (b) For the diagrammatically simple line of cosmic decline, Hake- will substitutes an irregular, zig-zag line, in which "special Provi- dences" (in ancient times particularly) replace the idea of an idyllic Golden age. (c) Should any feature of contemporary life indubitably present a decline from a previous period, Hakewill insists that this does not imply a rigid historical determinism. The agent can always assert his freedom and stand out from the trend he has discovered, thus falsifying the determinist's expectations. (d) Hakewill posits the tightest possible relation between God and nature, short of pantheistic identification of the two. Thus he guarantees to the world of nature the fullest measure of God's in- exhaustible power and goodness. A world so sustained could not decay. There is no inevitable contamination of the entire universe by human sin. God can and does restrict the area in which its effects are felt. (e) Hakewill challenges certain persuasive analogies and per- vasive images, which give plausibility to his opponents' writings. The cycles "youth-maturity-senescence" and "gold-to-iron" have no application to the universe as a whole. (f) He reinforces his own thesis with an abundance of images of fecundity and fertility, restoration, rejuvenation; and seeks to aug- ment confidence in the future progress of arts and sciences by the persistent language of "expansion," " opening-up" and "the re- vealing of the hitherto unseen."
