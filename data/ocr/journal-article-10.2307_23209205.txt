The Art Bulletin publishes leading scholarship in the English language in all aspects of art history as practiced in the academy, museums, and other institutions. From its founding in 1913 the journal has pub lished, through rigorous peer review, scholarly articles and critical reviews of the highest quality in all areas and periods of the history of art. Articles take a variety of methodological approaches, from the his torical to the theoretical. In its mission as a journal of record The Art Bulletin fosters an intensive engagement with intellectual developments and debates in contemporary art historical practice. The journal wel comes submissions from scholars worldwide and at every career stage. Statement on the Importance of Documenting the Historical Context of Objects and Sites The College Art Association expresses its con demnation of illicit or otherwise questionable practices in the obtain ing of archaeological, artistic, and ethnic objects, whether these are by theft, excavation, export, trade, or the wrongful seizure from legiti mate owners due to war, insurrection, or civil disturbance. Through the scholarly mission of its journals, The Art Bulletin, Art Journal, and caa.reviews, as well as through its programs and newsletters, the Col lege Art Association remains committed to its role in the dissemina tion of information to its membership and expects to contribute toward a dialogue and a better understanding of the issues of context and documentation of objects, and the historical circumstances of their ownership. As a result, the College Art Association discourages practices or procedures that might be construed as giving sanction to the acquisition, trade, and financial enhancement of cultural artifacts inappropriately excavated, collected, or appropriated. Authors sub mitting manuscripts for publication in The Art Bulletin, Art Journal, and caa.reviews should document, to the best extent possible, the prove Art Association, 50 Broadway, 21st floor, New York, N.Y. 10004.

Captions in The Art Bulletin and Art Journal use standardized language to describe image copyright and credit information, in order to clarify the copyright status of all images reproduced so far as possible, for the benefit of readers, researchers, and subsequent users of these images. Information on the copyright status of a reproduction is placed within parentheses, at the end of the caption data. A distinction is made between copyright status of an art work and of the photograph or scan of an artwork pro vided for reproduction purposes, where this information has been provided to us. In order to provide clear information to readers, rights holders, and subsequent users of images, GAA has established conven tions for describing the copyright status of the works we publish: Artwork in the public domain Artwork copyright © Name Photograph copyright © Name Photograph provided by [name of photographer, image bank, or other provider] Artwork published under fair use Photograph by Name (where copyright is not asserted by the provider) Photograph by the author Where the information is available, a work of art is iden tified as being either in copyright or in the public domain. If the copyright holder is known, it is identified. If an artwork is in the public domain but copyright is asserted in the photograph or scan of the artwork used for reproduc tion, the copyright status of both artwork and photograph is identified in two discrete notices. However, a caption may contain no copyright information at all, where none is available. The absence of a copyright notice or a © symbol should not be assumed to indicate that an image is either in or out of copyright. Similarly, the absence of any state ment that a work is "in the public domain" should not be construed as indicating that it is not in the public domain— only that information was insufficient for the editors to make a determination. Reproductions of pictures of mate rial not subject to copyright may have caption information that contains copyright information for the photograph or scan used for reproduction but not for the content of the photograph. Where permission was requested from a rights holder, the language requested by that rights holder is used, in some instances edited for clarity. The term "photograph [or scan] provided by" is used to indicate the supplier of the photo graph. "Courtesy of" is not used. The term of copyright varies internationally, and CAA does not assert that a work identi fied as in the public domain is necessarily out of copyright throughout the world. Where the caption indicates that we are asserting fair use, we make that assertion only under United States law. The authors and publisher make reasonable efforts to ascer tain the rights status of all third-party works. Any corrections should be sent to the Publications Dept., CAA.</page><page sequence="5">Publication of The Art Bulletin is made possible by mem bership support and by contributions from individuals and institutions.

The Arthur Kingsley Porter Prize was estab lished in 1957 for the encouragement of beginning schol ars of any nationality in art-historical studies. It is awarded annually, or at the discretion of the officers of the College Art Association, for an article published in The Art Bulletin by a scholar who is under the age of thirty-five or within ten years of receiving the doctorate at the time the article was accepted for publication, and judged by a jury to be of sound scholarship, original content, and distinguished presentation.</page><page sequence="6">Contents Volume XCIV Number 1 March 2012 Editor's Note Regarding Art and Art History Notes from the Field: Anthropomorphism Interview Two Are Better than One: Notes on the Interview and Techniques of Multiplication "Curiosity Is the Motor of the Entire Interview Project": Hans Ulrich Obrist in Conversation with Philip Ursprung Articles Of Modes and Manners in Japanese Ink Painting: Sesshu's Splashed Ink Landscape of 1495 Splashed Ink Landscape by the Zen monk-painter Sesshu Toyo (1420-1506?) embodies a complex relation between medieval Japanese ink painting and artistic subjectivity. A careful study of the history and semantics of splashed ink and the painting's inscriptions reveals Sesshu's work to be a multifaceted pictorial artifact that reflects how monk-painters during Japan's medieval period imagined artistic transmission in terms of a spiritual bloodline. It also demonstrates how using the splashed ink mode to formalize such transmission allowed the monk-painter to be cast as a cultivated gendeman according to classical literati aesthetic discourse. Henry Fuseli: Greek Tragedy and Cultural Pluralism The wash drawings and oil paintings of subjects from Greek tragedy by Anglo-Swiss painter Henry Fuseli (1741-1825), routinely categorized as ro mantic classicism, might be better explained in terms of the contemporary revival of Greek tragedy, made possible by the philosophical anthropology of Johann Gottfried von Herder and David Garrick's theater of character. From this climate of experimentation with foreign cultures arose a morally detached spectator and a critique of Eurocentrism in the era of Captain Cook and the American Revolution. Fuseli's classicism thus played its part in the formation of the modern liberal version of cultural pluralism. Agent Provocateur? The African Origin and American Life of a Statue from Cote d'lvoire A biography of a statue sculpted in or near the Lagoon region of Cote d'lvoire reveals how her "social life" has become entangled with American art history. Created to address spiritual beings in her homeland, she was purchased by Paul Guillaume in France and was exhibited by Alfred Stieglitz and Marius de Zayas in New York in 1914. Donated to Fisk University by Georgia O'Keeffe in 1949, she has engaged in a dialogue with African American artists. In all of these interactions, the figure has been not a passive object but an active agent of cultural change. 7 ANNE M. WAGNER 8 ELIZABETH KING, J. M.
