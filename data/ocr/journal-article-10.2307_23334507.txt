The year 2009 marks two central events in the history of science and western cul ture, the second centennial of the birth of Charles Darwin and the 150* anniversary of the publication of the Origin of Species, Darwin's famous work that still elicits lively philosophical, scientific, and theological discussions. Vittorio Martucci, an historian</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci„ 31 (2009), 465-514 481 of biology, has written Scimmioni e vecchi merletti. Le scimmie antropomorfe e i dibat titi ottocenteschi sull'origine dell'uomo, to anticipate the twin celebrations by offering readers, even less expert ones, a compelling treatment of the "long, excited and varied debate that has taken place in the 19th century ... on the origins of man from other living forms" (8). Martucci's title refers to the history of the appearance of the monkey in human genealogy, a controversial notion among inhabitants of old Europe and young Ameri ca, especially among the so-called bourgeoisie of "old lace" puritans, and convention al thinkers, who considered the "great big monkeys" as unwanted and embarrassing guests in their history. He relates the humorous anecdote surrounding the awarding of an honorary degree in law to Darwin at Cambridge in 1877. Apparently, several students arranged to have a huge puppet monkey to appear suddenly in the hall when Darwin entered before the large crowd. The laughter of the students and the bewil derment of the academicians only subsided after the puppet monkey had been "remo ved." However, Martucci writes, the great big patchwork monkey, although invisible, remained hidden in the room to enjoy the show of praise given to "that bearded man . . . who had affirmed with great authority that one of these creatures a long time ago had slowly changed through modification, thus giving origin to the gentleman and the lady sitting in the first row in silent respectful attention. And the monkey stayed on because from that moment on nobody succeeded to remove him from the gatherings of men where he had assumed the part of the unpresentable relative whom, however, it is impossible to send away" (8). The first chapter in the book investigates how Buffon, Cuvier, I. Geoffroy Saint Hilaire, Owen, Savage, Wallace, and other scientists dealt with "unpresentable rela tives" of humans. The crucial date was 1735, when Linneaus in his Systema naturae first placed man and the monkeys together for the first time in Anthropomorpha. Here, the world of the monkeys became known to Europeans along with their habits and habi tats, as well as the distinctions among chimpanzee, orangutan, and the latest discovery, the gorilla, which through travel reports, novels, and, more recently, the movies had taken hold of the popular imagination. By the twentieth century, King Kong (1933), the classic movie by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, represented the heighte ned interest in the primates, largely through the inspiration from the Origin of Species. In the next chapter, Martucci considers the debates surrounding evolutionary ideas by turning his attention first to philosophers of the previous century, such as Jean-Jac ques Rousseau in his Discours sur l'origine et le fondement de l'inégalité parmi les hom mes (1755) and Immanuel Kant in Antropologia (1798). After examining the important contributions of Jean Baptiste Monet de Lamarck, he then concentrates on the debate, including its coup de théâtre, between the famous, wealthy, and established Richard Owen and the young, combative, and anticonformist Thomas Henry Huxley. The for mer was the tenacious and obstinate opponent of Darwin's theories, while the latter re mained Darwin's supporter and friend. Owen always denied even the slightest kinship between humans and the animals. Beginning in a note to the Linnean Society in 1857, he polemically reinforced the substantial differences between the human brain and that of the other primates. Huxley's opinions were diametrically opposed. In a lecture that same year, The Special Peculiarities of Men, he affirmed that "at the base of his na ture man is an integral part of the organic world" (74). Following the appearance of the Origin of Species, Huxley began his defence of Darwin, even contrasting his ideas with Owen, initially at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meetings in Oxford, still considered as the "battle" of Oxford. The contrasts between Owen and Huxley lasted from this time practically until the death of the two opponents in 1892</page><page sequence="3">482 BOOK REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 31 (2009), 465-514 and 1895 respectively. After Owen's, Huxley, while promoting a campaign to collect funds for a statue of his adversary, wrote to Joseph Dalton Hooker with an acute sense of irony and humour: "Now that he cannot cause trouble any longer he has the right to be acknowledged for such work" (85). In the third and fourth chapters Martucci treats the discussions surrounding Dar win in the rest of Europe. The Origin of Species was translated in Germany (1860), France (1862), Italy (1864), Sweden in 1869, and at the beginning of the same decade in czarist Russia. In these distinct national contexts, the disagreements that had star ted during the 18th century between monogenicists and polygenicists became more accentuated and pronounced, especially as racial theories emerged that soon led to tra gic consequences. The polygenicists observed differences among races and concluded their different origins, a concept favoured by followers of the Enlightenment such as Voltaire. The monogenicists argued, on the contrary, that all the races had a common origin, a view maintained by the romantic philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder. In the second half of the 19th century, new anthropological discoveries were used by some polygenicsts to propose new and increasingly upsetting hypotheses: "Some races, as, e.g. the black of Africa or Australia, not only were considered at the very end on the scale of human beings; they were also considered irreparably close to some representa tives of the monkey world in a position where they formed some kind of link between anthropomorphic monkeys and the human species (99). In Europe, Germany was where the Darwin's ideas were most enthusiatically em braced, especially by materialistic scientists such as Carl Vogt and Ernst Haeckel. The latter, "a true champion of the German Darwinism," argued that contrary to his French colleagues who tended to be anti-Darwinian, including the open-minded Armand Quatrefages de Breau, he believed humans and monkeys had the same origin. "The human race - Haeckel wrote in 1868 - is a branch of catarrhines; it has developed in Ancient times and descends from monkeys of that group extinct a long time ago" (p. 118). Haeckel's position was violently in opposition to conventional religious views, as Martucci notes by quoting from Anthropogenie (1874). In Italy, a similar position was maintained by Filippo De Filippi in a lecture he presented at Turin in 1864 entitled, "Luomo e le scimmie" ("On man and monkeys"). De Filippi was well known locally, but not so well recognized nationally, and soon found himself villified in the press. Additionally, he was attacked from the pulpit in Turin when a priest suggested that just before his death, De Filippi would recognize "his guilt" for his impiety and would ask "God's forgiveness." De Filippi attempted to respond to his critics, but this just added fuel to the flames. To escape his detractors, he began a trip around the world, only to die of hepatitis in Hong Kong at the age of 53. Others continued his work, however, especially Giovanni Canestrini and the Russian physiologist, Aleksander Herzen, resul ting in a continuing polemical argument. The book concludes with perhaps Martucci's strongest and most interesting chap ter. Here, the author discusses Darwin's naturalistic concepts of humans as they for med during his travels on the "Beagle." Observing humans in a "savage" condition, he considered the animal nature of humans. Reflecting on his experiences in 1838, Darwin noted, "The human mind is not more perfect than the instincts of the animals in relation to all the circumstances and their changes, or in relation to the respective bodies. Our lineal ascendance is therefore the origin of our wicked passions! The devil under the form of a baboon is our ancestor" (173). In Darwin's work, Descent of Man (1871), he confirms that humans are mammalian on morphological and physiological grounds. He also admits an immense difference between the human mind and animal mind, but concludes that the there is a "difference of grade, not of genus." Darwin's</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 31 (2009), 465-514 483 conclusion is that humans discend from an animal ancestry through natural selection, but remains "one of the several extraordinary forms of the primates." It is just this conclusion that still causes uneasiness. Antonio Borrelli, Biblioteca Universitaria di Napoli, via G. Paladino 39, 80138 Na poli, Italy.</page></plain_text>
