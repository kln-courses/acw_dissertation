<plain_text><page sequence="1">P 0 ET R Y COMMENT THE ENCYCLOPAEDIC, TWO KINDS OF Literary Criticism: A Short History, by William K. Wimsatt, Jr. &amp; Cleanth Brooks. Alfred A. Knopf. $8.95. Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays, by Northrop Frye. Princeton Univer sity Press, $6.oo. In his Anatomy of Criticism, referring to "the clerical poet who, like Gower or the author of the Cursor Mundi, tries to get everything he knows into one vast poem or poetic testament", Mr. Frye says: "The encyclopaedic knowledge in such poems is regarded sacramentally, as a human analogy of divine knowledge." Accordingly, we might say that both the prose works here under consideration are in this technical sense "divine". For each in its way is a survey vast in scope, involving a ton or more of knowledge-and each has its own rare excellence, though as kinds of survey they differ greatly. The Frye volume starts from a unitary principle, which becomes modified and supplemented in the course of adaptation to the various problems that arise en route. The Wimsatt-Brooks volume (a "short" history, they say, of their 755 large, packed pages) begins with a great diversity of material which must be presented primarily in its own terms-and then the attempt is made gradually to sift things down until something like an over-all picture emerges. But the rules of procedure underlying these two books are so different that, though the Frye Anato my has a much wider sweep than the Wimsatt-Brooks History, paradoxi cally the Anatomy gets but two pages in the History-yet Mr. Frye can consider himself lucky; for by the nature of the case, many good critics rate even much less space, in the discussion allotted to their theories. Sometimes an over-simplified statement that represents a doctrine to excess gets better coverage than more fully developed and better rounded views that lend themselves less readily to quick summarization and placement. To an extent, the sheer "dramatics" of such a survey invite to a featuring of overly partial positions. But often, where a theory is not treated in the body of a chapter, the authors seek to make amends 320</page><page sequence="2">KENNETH BURKE by quoting in a supplement good samples of the critic's views. Another notable contrast between the two books: In the Frye volume, there are almost no quotations except for fragmentary references in a few pages of notes at the back of the book. Everything is made stylistically of one piece by being viewed solely through the eyes of the author. But the Wimsatt-Brooks volume quotes copiously. To begin with the "short history": The summarizations are done with exceptional scrupulosity; the authors cover an astounding amount of ground without becoming superficial. Part of their skill at charac terization comes from the fact that, while reporting on ideas, they seem always on the look-out for whatever succinct images may have been used (by either friend or foe) to suggest the tenor of a given position. Nor do they aim at a false symmetry by Procrustean methods. Besides saying in effect, "He says this, therefore that," they often go on to say in effect, "He says this, however also that." And while keeping uppermost the stress upon literary criticism as a specialty, the authors seek to make clear the points at which literary criticism impinges upon other fields (philosophy, psychology, anthropology, and the like). Part One deals with Greek and Roman classics of criticism (primarily Plato, Aristotle, Horace, Longinus, Plotinus). Part Two goes from the mediaeval period through the Renaissance, and on through eighteenth century neoclassicism. Part Three reviews developments from Words worth and Coleridge (also with relation to "poetic diction" and "Ger man Ideas"), Shelley, Arnold, art for art's sake generally, with special honors at the end to Croce's expressionism (and culminating in a chap ter where the history surveys the historical method itself). Part Four deals with the issues uppermost in the critical practices of writers now living: Symbolism, "The Semantic Principle", Richards, Pound, Eliot, "myth and archetype". And in an Epilogue the authors mull over all that has gone before, explicitly discussing their own eclectic preferences (compris ing the mimetic emphasis of Aristotle, the stress on the "affective" in Richards, and Crocean expressionism-with, of course, special stress upon the values of metaphor and irony; and finally the notion of poetry as a "tensional union of making with seeing and saying"). But surely the most succinct presentation of their particular slant occurs on pp. 5I7-5I9, where the authors draw up a "balance sheet" of the things to be said for and against the "Crocean system". 32I</page><page sequence="3">POETRY The book forcefully reminds one of the many other voices (besides those of his own choosing) that have been asseverating throughout the centuries; and it takes advantage of much fine criticism that might other wise be neglected. It helps one, in methodological asceticism, to suffer oneself to be blown every which way by the shifting winds of doctrine. And it makes Saintsbury's history seem somewhat "quaint", as viewed from the standpoint of the issues that most exercise us at present. (Per haps every age should write its particular history of literary criticism, just as every age requires its particular retranslations of the classics.) The authors have done a great service in lending their authority to the notion that the Rhetoric as well as the Poetics should be considered when one is thinking of Aristotle as literary critic. Critics have been al most psychotic in their determination to overlook the fact that in the Poetics itself the reader is explicitly referred to the Rhetoric when consid ering the element of drama which Aristotle places after Plot and Charac ter; namely: Thought (dianoia, a term that Mr. Frye makes much of). However, their definition of Rhetoric, "a study of how words work", does not point up the full resources of Aristotle's Rhetoric. (Aristotle's Rhetoric is particularly rich in observations and methods that would automatically guard critics against making the "close" inspection of texts synonymous with narrowness of outlook.) Again, their definition some what dissociates from rhetoric the principle of "affectivity" that runs through all rhetorical theory, the concern with ways of "bending" an audience (if we may shift to Cicero's word, which Augustine adapts to his treatise on Christian rhetoric). Thus, note that the lines quoted from Edmund Burke (on p. 299) five times use the word "effect" in one form or another, as would befit the rhetorical slant natural to him as an orator; but the authors here stress rather the equally relevant point about the relation between Burke's position and the theory of "association". Incidentally, among the best sections in the book are the pages that deal with the "association of ideas", in its position midway between the Augustan stress upon "wit" and the Romantic stress upon "imagination". But it has recently been called to my attention that next year is the hundredth anniversary of the birth of the French critic, Remy de Gour mont, who proposed the term, "dissociation of ideas", in an essay with that title. The authors cite Pound's dictum that "De Gourmont prepared our era"; and they refer to De Gourmont with relation to Eliot and the 322</page><page sequence="4">KENNETH BURKE "dissociation of sensibility". But I submit that they should also have in cluded an account of De Gourmont's graciously nihilistic essay, in which De Gourmont thus rounds out the subject of associationism by an experi mentally negative approach. For this essay goes far toward analyzing the kind of "harmonious discords" for which these authors express a clear preference. This preference I share with them, as per my section on the "gargoyle thinking" of "perspective by incongruity" in an early book of mine, Permanence and Change, recently re-issued. The section is concerned with the ways whereby (in poetry, philosophy, and science) a kind of vision or vista is got, through the abrupt juxtaposing of categories that were otherwise felt to be disrelated or even mutually exclusive. Besides being a fit for the French Symbolism of its day, the De Gourmont approach can also point back to the seventeenth-century Metaphysicals and forward to contemporary Surrealist trends. In my discussion of such "planned in congruity", I temporarily forgot the role of De Gourmont, despite my earlier salutes to this essay in Counter-Statement. I was busy watching in stead Spengler's use of the method in ways adapted from the "perspec tivism" of Nietzsche (to whom, incidentally, De Gourmont himself ac knowledges indebtedness, though not on this particular matter). But I have since tried to make amends, as I am now doing, and as with a section on De Gourmont in my Rhetoric of Motives. All these points, I feel, bear directly upon what the History calls "the formal principle of anachronism in poetry". Also, they help restore the prestige of "fancy", which suffered when Coleridge, having so explicitly "desynonymized" fancy and im agination, proceeded to praise imagination so highly that, by the sheer dialectics of the case, fancy rated low. As a rule, the authors are not interested in a possible dimension of symbolism whereby the objects of pure poetry or pure theory may be in effect a pageantry reflecting the social order out of which such expressions arise. Yet when considering Pope and Dryden, they make some excep tionally apt observations along such lines. And when, discussing the turn from the Augustan to the Romantic, they speak of a flight "from au thority to the outdoors", here they offer a good lead into possible further speculations as to just how the cult of "nature in the raw" might im plicitly contain its own analogue of the social order, however irrelevant such a cult might seem on its face. Though the authors show little patience 323</page><page sequence="5">POETRY with Marxist criticism, such observations as theirs on Pope and Dryden could be called Marxist criticism in the best sense of the term (as could Empson's book on pastoral). Obviously, every critic could haggle over details, in a book of such range. The main thing, however, is to salute it. In the "short history" ("short," they say!) Northrop Frye is discussed in connection with his stress upon the importance of "archetypes" in literature. The History notes that the term, "borrowed from Jung, means a primordial image, a part of the collective unconscious, the psychic residue of numberless experiences of the same kind, and thus part of the inherited response-pattern of the race". Mr. Frye's own definition in his book (a considerable development beyond the early Kenyon Review ar ticle which serves as the basis of the historians' report), is: "A symbol, usually an image, which recurs often enough in literature to be recognized as an element of one's literary experience as a whole." And elsewhere in the book he says that though Jung accounts for the communicability of the archetypes by a theory of the collective unconscious, "this is an unnecessary hypothesis in literary criticism, so far as I can judge." But in any case, the archetype does seem to be the generative principle of his four essays. And apparently his belief in it is what provides the ground for his other perceptions, which come thick and fast, and are often quite unusual in themselves, and are brilliantly put. I would do Mr. Frye a disservice if I attempted here, in a brief space, to give a summary of his four essays. His analysis of modes, symbols, myths, and genres is complicated by subdivision into themes, phases, imagery, rnythoi, rhythms, forms (with even spring, summer, autumn, and winter brought in to throw a suggestive semi-Spenglerian light on comedy, romance, tragedy, and irony or satire, respectively), all these being in turn further subdivided and crossed with other terms. I cannot lay claim to having yet made myself at home in his nomenclature. Matters are still more complicated by the fact that, being what he himself calls a "ter minological buccaneer", he frequently uses traditional words in a sense peculiarly his own. However, though such special usages may add some what to your discomfiture when you are first trying to find your way around in Mr. Frye's rich reticulation of variously interrelated terms, they also help to give the Anatomy the liveliness of an exceptional per sonality. With this author, new slants on things come easy, urgently, with a rush-and the best policy for the reader is to relax and enjoy them. 324</page><page sequence="6">KENNETH BURKE But one should mention at least the five "modes" which the author develops from Aristotle's distinction between the two genres of tragedy and comedy. These are: "myth" (having gods as heroes), "romance" (the hero being human, though capable of marvelous acts in a marvelous environment), "high mimetic" (most'epicandltragedy, having "the kind of hero that Aristotle had in mind"), "low mimetic" (most comedy and realistic fiction, having a kind of hero who "is one of us"), and "ironic" ("where the hero is inferior in power and intelligence to ourselves, so that we have the sense of looking down on a scene of bondage, frustra tion, or absurdity"). In his first essay, he "encyclopaedically" surveys the many species of works he would class under each of these heads, inci dentally dealing with such related matters as tragic flaw, pity, fear, ro manticism, pathos, Angst, the miles gloriosus, eiron and alazon, the phar makos or scapegoat, melodrama ("advance propaganda for the police state"), play, ghosts, tonality, plausibility, and what he considers the "two poles of literature" (one, the "mimetic tendency . . . to verisimili tude and accuracy of description"; the other, "a tendency to tell a story which is in origin a story about characters who can do anything"). The chapter ends on a distinction between Aristotelian "catharsis" and Longinian "ecstasis", which are rated as better suited to plays and lyrics respectively. The second essay is on the "theory of symbols", the author meaning by symbol "any unit of any literary structure that can be isolated for critical attention." As might be expected, "image" plays a big role here but the best way to understand this chapter is to think of it merely as on the road towards the next chapter, on the theory of "archetypes", here defined as "associative clusters" which "differ from signs in being com plex variables". His distinction is suggested neatly in this illustration: "As an archetype, green may symbolize hope or vegetable nature or a go sign in traffic or Irish patriotism as easily as jealousy, but the word green as a verbal sign always refers to a certain color." Or at another point, after defining an archetype as "a typical or recurring image", he pro ceeds: I mean by an archetype a symbol which connects one poem with another and thereby helps to unify and integrate our literary experience. And as the archetype is the communicable symbol, archetypal criticism is primarily concerned with literature as a social fact and as a mode of communication 325</page><page sequence="7">POETRY The quotation should serve also to indicate how his theory of arche types leads finally into a theory of genres, considered as different "rhythms" (recurrence, continuity, decorum, association) and "forms" (drama, lyric, epos, prose fiction, the "encyclopaedic") that are designed to produce effects upon an audience. The genres and modes in turn shade into "narrative pregeneric elements" ("rnythoi or generic plots") in the sense that by "tragedy" or "comedy" we may have in mind not "names for two species of drama", but merely "a certain kind of structure or mood". All told, though he would reintroduce a variant of the classical concern with literary genres, his classifications are so manifold, and so like a sliding scale rather than a fixed system of differentiations, they suggest somewhat the sort of thing that happened with Schoenberg in music when he ex panded the principle of modulation, making it so ubiquitous and constant that it could become hardly distinguishable from no modulation at all. Here is a good example of his shadings: Romance, therefore, is characterized by the acceptance of pity and fear, which in ordinary life relate to pain, as forms of pleasure. It turns fear at a distance, or terror, into the adventurous; fear at contact, or horror, into the marvellous, and fear without an object, or dread (Angst) into a pensive melancholy. It turns pity at a distance, or concern, into the theme of chivalrous rescue; pity at contact, or tenderness, into a languid and relaxed charm, and pity without an object (which has no name but is a kind of animism, or treating everything in nature as though it had human feelings) into creative fantasy. Everywhere we turn, from whatever point of view the author happens to be dividing up the literary realm, we encounter things thus shading into one another. Hence, "the center of the literary universe is whatever poem we happen to be reading." Such a flower-in-the-crannied-wall position culminates in what he calls, somewhat redundantly, "apocalyptic revelation". Or, as he puts it elsewhere: Anagogically, then, poetry unites total ritual, or social action, with total dream, or unlimited individual thought. Its universe is infinite and bound less hypothesis: it cannot be contained within any actual civilization or set of moral values, for the same reason that no structure of imagery can be 326</page><page sequence="8">KENNETH BURKE restricted to one allegorical interpretation. Here the dianoia of art is . the Logos, the shaping word which is both reason and, as Goethe's Faust speculated, praxis or creative act. The ethos of art is no longer a group of characters within a natural setting, but a universal man who is also a divine being, or a divine being conceived in anthropomorphic terms. Presumably Mr. Frye's notion of the anagogic, as a poetic analogue of the all-enfolding Logos, would amount to a kind of lyric transcendence, an idealistically mythic (or "archetypal") view of everything as contained within an over-arching or all-encompassing Monas Monadum, in a scheme that would be a post-Leibnitzian, post-Hegelian reclamation of Neo-Platonism. It culminates in his notion of the "quest-myth" as the archetype of archetypes. And thus, like the "monomyth" school gen erally, he stops his generalizing at the point where he might, by just one more step, end with a dialectic of purely abstract design (if, for instance, he went from "quest" to some such notion as "transformation" or "de velopment" in general). Messrs. Wimsatt and Brooks raise against Mr. Frye's position an ob jection that, in one form or another, they raise against many: "The inert and valueless 'document' will submit to the kind of classification that Frye specifies just as well as a valuable poem." And, as he indicates in his "Polemic Introduction", Mr. Frye would agree with them, though with out feeling at all down-hearted: Value-judgments are subjective in the sense that they can be indirectly but not directly communicated. When they are fashionable or generally ac cepted, they look objective, but that is all.... We begin to suspect that the literary value-judgments are projections of social ones.... Every de liberately constructed hierarchy of values in literature known to me is based on a concealed social, moral, or intellectual analogy. . . . The sub stitution of subordination and value-judgment for coordination and de scription, the substitution of "all poets should" for "some poets do", is only a sign that all the relevant facts have not yet been considered.... The positive value-judgment is founded on a direct experience which is central to criticism yet forever excluded from it. Criticism can account for it only in critical terminology, and that terminology can never recapture or include the original experience. 327</page><page sequence="9">POETRY Value-judgments, says Mr. Frye, are necessarily circular, ultimately reducible to ways of saying: " 'all plays that have unity of action must have unity of action,' or, more simply and more commonly, 'all good plays must be good plays.'" So there! And meanwhile, Mr. Frye will persist in his frenzy, or orgy, of rheostatic classifying. KENNETH BURKE</page></plain_text>
