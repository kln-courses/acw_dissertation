On the Threshold of Civilization: The Hohokam of Arizona by Randall H. McGuire and Michael B. Schiffer On Manje tenant June returned Juan 26, 1694, Matheo Lieu- to one tenant Juan Matheo Manje returned to one of the northern outposts of New Spain at Caborca, Sonora, having completed a journey of exploration through what later became the Papago Indian Reserva- tion of southwestern Arizona. Feverish from drinking brackish water, he recounted a story he had heard of a large river to the north lined with "casas grandes," or tall houses with thick walls. His superior, Father Eusebio Fran- cisco Kino, received this tale skeptically until Pima Indians from the village of Bac, near modern Tucson, confirmed Manje's account and offered to guide the padre to these mysterious homes. Kino traveled inland as far north as the Gila River where, in November 1694, he encountered a four-story great house "as large as a castle and equal to the largest church in Sonora." The building, known today as Casa Grande, had been abandoned but was still in good condition, needing only roof repairs to make it habitable. The native Pima Indians held the structure in awe, deposit- ing precious feathers, arrows, gourds, and other valuables in one of the rooms. Nearby, Kino observed the ruins of many other smaller houses surround- ing the Casa Grande and a large canal with banks more than 5.5 meters wide. The padre also heard of seven or eight other great houses and the remains of entire cities to the north, west and east. The ruins of the Classic Hohokam Indians had been discovered. Since the time of Kino, explorers and, somewhat later, archaeologists have attempted to understand the nature of the society responsible for the Casa Grande. Working between 1885 and 1910, Frank Hamilton Cushing and Jesse Walter Fewkes, the first archaeologists to study the Hohokam, wedded their excavated data to Pima and other Indian legends. In their view, great chiefs or lords resided in palatial structures arid dominated a large peas- antry in an ancient feudal society. Surveys and exca- vations in the late 1920s and 1930s conducted by Harold S. Gladwin, Erich Schmidt and Emil W. Haury disclosed a long archaeological sequence leading up to the Classic period. The Hohokam Classic period (ca. A.D. 1150-1450) is characterized by adobe compounds that enclose rectangular rooms and plazas, platform mounds, extensive irrigation canals, and polychrome and polished redware ceramics. During the Classic, hundreds of agricultural villages consisting of from one to over 100 compounds each dotted the Gila and Lower Salt Rivers of central Arizona. For the next several dec- ades, however, research fo- cused on the earlier Hohokam periods, and the Classic was virtually ignored. Begin- ning in the late 1960s and 1970s, fieldwork carried out in advance of proposed dams, mines, highways, and other projects led to renewed interest in the enigmatic con- structions discovered by Padre Kino. Ironically, what has emerged is a picture of Classic society not unlike the one sketched by the pioneer archaeologists nearly a century ago. Today archaeologists are analyzing the rise and fall of the Hohokam to understand the development of complex societies around the globe. Although the Hohokam may seem less significant compared to most archaeological sequences in world prehistory- the great civilizations that rose in places like Egypt, Peru, Mesoamerica, and Mesopotamia- their emer- gence and collapse especially fascinates students of cultural evolution because they almost reached civilization. Many factors that figure in the rise of civilization, including irrigation agriculture, social stratification, and a relatively high popula- tion density, were present in Arizona. But they did not give birth to a Hohokam civilization. The first archaeologists to excavate Classic period Hohokam sites took to the field in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Cushing worked near present-day Phoenix on what was the first archaeo- logical excavation in Arizona. He excavated several ruins during the winters of 1886-88, concentrating his efforts on Los Muertos- probably the largest Classic Hohokam site. In the winters of 1906-8, Fewkes dug extensively in the great house itself and nearby ruins in the Casa Grande National Monu- ment. The investigations of Cushing and Fewkes revealed large habitation compounds, canals, cre- mations and burials, pottery and other domestic artifacts of the Classic period and, at Los Muertos, the poorly preserved remnants of another great house. The fieldwork also exposed the remains of more ephemeral structures, known today simply as pithouses- small, oval structures dug partially into the desert soil and probably roofed with brush and mud- not unlike aboriginal Pima houses. Cushing and Fewkes drew on their intimate knowledge of living southwestern tribes, and partic- ularly on Pima legends, to formulate their reconstructions of Classic Hohokam society. Today the Pima refer to the Casa Grande and other 22 Archaeology</page><page sequence="2">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="3">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="4">Gila Polychrome was the most common painted pot- tery during the Hohokam Classic period.

Diameter, 24 centimeters. large ruins of the Gila and Salt Rivers as "va-aki," or magic houses, each erected by a magic chief or "si-vane." A man named Bitterman si-vane is credited with building the Casa Grande. Legends also recount the triumphs of a great leader, Elder Brother, who led the Pima against the oppres- sive si-vane and their followers. Elder Brother and his forces first attacked the Casa Grande, then home of Morning-blue si-vane, and destroyed it. From there the victorious army moved along the Salt and Gila rivers attacking each lesser va-aki, one by one, destroying them and killing their resident chiefs. Told repeatedly and with great conviction by the Pima, such stories furnished Cushing and Fewkes with ready-made interpretations for the impressive ruins. The large adobe compounds obviously were the houses of great chiefs- the si- vane- who ruled over Elder Brother's people, a hapless peasantry. These early researchers also presumed that this feudal Indian society lasted only a few hundred years, placing the downfall of the si- vane into the recent past when Padre Kino visited the region. Two decades passed before the Hohokam again became subjects of archaeology. A new wave of re- searchers, whose impact was felt beginning in the mid-1920s, viewed the Cushing-Fewkes recon- structions of Classic native society as unbridled speculation. Suddenly, a reliance on Indian legends was regarded as unscientific, and questions about the nature of a prehistoric society were viewed as unanswerable. Priorities shifted to questions of chronology and culture sequence, as archaeologists (Left, above) These Sacaton Red-on-buff (a.D. 900-1100) effigy vessels portray mountain sheep , a common Hohokam decorative motif that appeared both in ceramics and on rock art.

The 1920s also witnessed the introduction of new archaeological techniques such as stratigraphy and tree-ring dating. Stratigraphie excavations demonstrated that the structures Cushing and Fewkes had discovered were not all contemporane- ous: pithouses dated earlier than the compounds and great houses. The perfection of tree-ring dating, or dendrochronology, in 1929 allowed the ruins and pottery types of northern Arizona and New Mexico to be dated with uncanny accuracy. And fortunately, some of these very same ceramic types were discovered as trade goods in southern Arizona, clearly indicating that Hohokam sites were far older than just a few hundred years. By the early 1930s, archaeologists learned that the Casa Grande was built in the fourteenth century, and other Hohokam sites were of even greater antiquity. It was even more important now to define the cultural sequence preceding the Classic period. Si-vane, Elder Brother and the Classic period were forgotten until the early 1970s. Most of the revelations about the Hohokam sequence resulted from the work of Harold S. Gladwin and Emil W. Haury. Gladwin, whose interest in archaeology had been sparked by his acquaint- ance with A.V. Kidder, the foremost southwestern archaeologist of the time, sold his seat on the New York Stock Exchange and moved west, estab- lishing a foundation for archaeological research in 1928. Built on the remnants of a fourteenth- century ruin, the Gila Pueblo Foundation in Globe, Arizona played a leading role in southwestern archaeology and was the main focus of Hohokam research for a decade. One of Gladwin's first employees in fact was a young graduate of the University of Arizona, Emil W. Haury, who went on to become Director of the Arizona State Museum and head of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Arizona. In order to define how much land the Hohokam occupied and especially to search for their origin, Gladwin dispatched survey crews to the distant corners of the Southwest, from southern California to Texas and Chihuahua in Mexico, seeking the distinctive red-on-buff pottery that marked Hohokam sites. The Gila Pueblo surveys corrobo- rated the existence of two pre-Classic periods, the so-called Colonial and Sedentary, which Gladwin himself had set up on the basis of stratigraphie tests in the vicinity of the Casa Grande during 1926. In Gladwin's view, however, the earliest known period- the Colonial- was too advanced in ceramics and other arts to represent the original Hohokam. Yet despite their unprecedented coverage the Gila Pueblo surveys failed to disclose a suitable progenitor for the Hohokam. Reluctantly, Gladwin decided to concentrate the search for the elusive earlier "Pioneer" period in the Hohokam heartland of the Gila and Salt rivers. In 1934 Emil Haury and his Gila Pueblo co- workers began excavations at the site of Snaketown, a large pre-Classic ruin on the Gila River just south of Phoenix.

These two Santa Cruz Red-on-buff jars are from the Snaketown site . Height of tall jar in back- ground , ca. 30 centimeters . promised to reveal a long sequence of Hohokam development. Within the first few weeks of field- work, the Gila Pueblo staff had uncovered indisputable ceramic evidence of the Pioneer period, culminating in a sequence for the Hohokam- Pioneer, Colonial, Sedentary, and Classic. Unfor- tunately, there were few intrusive sherds at Snaketown that could be used for dating the actual beginning of the Pioneer period, although by assuming a constant rate of ceramic change Gladwin and Haury made the reasonable guess of 300 B.c. In the decades following the 1938 publication of the Snaketown findings, numerous investigators, including Gladwin himself, challenged the distinc- tiveness of the Hohokam periods and their dating. To resolve these controversies, Haury returned to Snaketown in 1964-5. The results of his extensive excavations validated the original ordering of the periods and their constituent phases. Regrettably, he still did not succeed in determining exactly when the Hohokam sequence began. The Pioneer period is in many ways the least understood, and most claims regarding it are controversial. Estimates for its appearance range from the original 300 b.c., still supported by Haury, to Schiffer's A.D. 500 which rests on the interpretation of Hohokam radiocarbon dates. Haury believes that the Pioneer Hohokam were im- migrants from northern Mexico who settled in the Gila-Salt Basin, while others suggest that the Hohokam evolved in place from Archaic hunting- gathering groups. Some archaeologists assume that the Pioneer folk were farmers who irrigated their crops with canal-drawn water. Others argue that agricultural products contributed few calories to the diet. Despite these disagreements, which stem partly from a paucity of known and excavated sites, it is clear that the Pioneer period Indians established a basic cultural pattern. Pioneer villages were small- at most several dozen roughly rectangular pithouses- and widely scattered, principally along the Gila and Salt rivers. Subsistence pursuits included gathering wild plant products such as mesquite beans, hunting, and growing domesticated plants, including corn, beans and squash. By the end of the period, the Hohokam utilized shallow, relatively short canals to water their fields. And when someone died, relatives cremated the body and buried the ashes with ceremoniously shattered ceramic vessels in trenches or pits. Their pottery was gray to buff, occasionally slipped orange-red or decorated with blood-red paint. During the aptly named Colonial period, which began sometime between A.D. 550-800 and persisted until A.D. 900-1000, Hohokam artifacts spread over a substantial part of Arizona. Whether this expansion actually came about by colonists moving into outlying areas, or whether Hohokam 26 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="6">(Above) During the Sacaton period (a.D. 900-1100), the Hohokam manufactured large painted jars with a Gila shoulder, a low sharp step in the wall of the vessel.

Regardless of the exact distribution process, Hohokam artifacts are found from the Mexican border north to Flagstaff and from Gila Bend east to Safford. Several elements were added to the Hohokam cultural pattern in the Colonial period, most notably ballcourts. Oval in shape and dug into the ground with earthen banks on each side, they vary greatly in size; smaller courts are only 20 meters or so in length, while the largest could enclose a football field. The function of these ballcourts, as might be expected, is disputed. Some believe that they were used for playing a Mesoamerican-style ball game; one can also find champions of a dance court interpretation. Adding fuel to the argument was the discovery of two pre-Spanish balls made of native rubber in southern Arizona, but unfortunately not in association with ballcourts. Most changes of the Colonial period were mainly elaborations of Pioneer themes. House shape went from rectangular to oval, but the brush and mud superstructure was retained. Ceramic decoration, stone carving and shell jewelry made from shells originating at the Gulf of California displayed greater sophistication in technique and design. The Hohokam became shell merchants, trading jewelry to other Indian societies in northern Arizona and New Mexico. And by the end of the Colonial period, most central and southern Arizona valleys were dotted with Hohokam agricultural settlements and canals. TVends initiated in the Pioneer and Colonial periods continued in the Sedentary period, beginning a.D. 900-1000 and ending around A.D. 1150. Longer canals as well as larger and more numerous villages testify to population growth and probably a considerable dependence on agriculture. TVade expanded with societies to the north and south. Specialized villages between the Gila River and the Gulf of California procured marine shell and worked it into jewelry that was traded north as far as Flagstaff. More exotic goods, copper bells, parrots, and iron pyrite mirrors were brought in from Mexico. In non-Hohokam villages near Flagstaff September/October 1982 27</page><page sequence="7">and on the present San Carlos Apache Reservation, isolated Hohokam-style houses and ballcourts appeared. These have been interpreted as Hohokam outposts associated with the shell trade. It is striking how much the Classic period departed from the orderly development of the Hohokam seen in the earlier periods. The most obvious changes took place in their architecture. Pithouses were no longer the major type of dwelling. Contiguous rectangular rooms of adobe were built instead, often arranged around plazas that were walled to form compounds. Villages usually contained several compounds, one of which was often built on a large flat-topped platform mound. Multi-storied great houses also appeared, the Casa Grande being the best preserved example. Expanded canal systems were further refined and carried water for dis- tances up to 32 kilometers, forming large networks of interconnected villages. Craft arts and burial practices also underwent marked changes. Early in the Classic, red-on-buff decorated types declined in popularity and were replaced by polished red vessels. Later, the dominant decorated ware became Gila Polychrome, which originated in the Tonto-Lake Roosevelt area near Globe, Arizona. Gila Polychrome is slipped red with black and white painted decorations, primarily on the interior of bowls. Greater standardization in technique and simplification are evident in the shell and stone art- ifacts. Cremation, which had been the prevalent mode for disposing of the dead, decreased in popularity. By the end of the Classic, the Hohokam had accepted the then widespread southwestern practice of burial in an extended position. Even the distribution of Classic settlements differed from preceding periods. Although there was a decline in the overall territory occupied by the Hohokam as some northern frontiers were aban- doned, the number of villages in the Gila-Salt Basin actually increased, and represented one of the two or three densest concentrations of people north of Mexico. The population of the Salt River Valley may have exceeded 20,000 persons- a figure that was not reached again until this century. Unlike ear- lier periods, when villages were confined to the first and second river terraces, the extensive canal systems allowed settlements to move considerable distances away from the rivers. In fact, the largest Classic village, Los Muertos, lay ten to 16 canal kilometers from the Salt, and included more than 100 compounds spread over an area of about 20 square kilometers. For stockbroker-turned-archaeologist Gladwin and Emil Haury, the Classic seemed too divergent to be Hohokam. They proposed that Salado groups to the northeast, makers of Gila Polychrome, had invaded Hohokam territory and introduced the hallmarks of this period- rectangular adobe rooms, platform mounds, polychrome pottery, and ex- tended burials. The Hohokam probably did not leave the area, according to Gladwin and Haury, but coexisted with the more progressive Salado. When these intruders left at the end of the Classic pe- riod, concludes this scenario, the Hohokam reverted to their former simpler way of life, eventually becoming the Pima who led Padre Kino to the Casa Grande. Neither Gladwin nor Haury speculated greatly on the character of Classic Hohokam social or- ganization. Although they did not accept the Pima legends as historical fact, both men were influ- enced nonetheless by the historic Pirnas. Haury especially saw little need to postulate a prehistoric society more complex than the Pirnas. To these archaeologists, the Classic Hohokam were tribal agriculturalists who incidentally built massive canal systems and monumental architecture. The Classic period differences amounted to nothing more than the stylistic preferences of another group -the Salado. This view prevailed until the 1960s and early 1970s when new evidence suggested that the Classic period could in fact be linked with an orderly de- velopment within the Hohokam tradition. The first clues were found in the Gila Bend area, when William Wasley and Alfred Johnson, then of the Arizona State Museum, discovered a Sedentary pe- riod platform mound at the Gatlin site. Inspired by the findings there, Wasley argued that the traits of the Classic period- inhumation, redware pottery, above-ground architecture, and platform mounds -were indigenous Hohokam developments. Haury 's reexcavation of Snaketown added more ammu- nition-a sequence of mounds beginning in the Colonial period. Both excavations also yielded evi- dence of Sedentary plazas surrounded by houses. Another important piece of the puzzle was found at Las Colinas where investigations by Laurens Hammack, also then of the Arizona State Museum, uncovered a complex mound that indisputably linked the Sedentary and Classic periods. Other proj- ects disclosed that the switch from pithouses to contiguous adobe rooms happened gradually and was marked by many transitional house forms. Finally, a Sedentary canal as large as any seen dur- ing the Classic was found in Phoenix. These discoveries suggest that the Classic was an outgrowth of the previous Hohokam periods and not the result of a foreign intrusion. Although population movements may have occurred at the beginning of the period, they cannot account for all the phenomena of the Classic. Recently, research- ers David Wilcox of the Arizona State Museum and Martin McAlister of the Tonto National Forest have resurrected the ideas of Cushing and Fewkes, and proposed that the Classic period represents a society more complex than the historic Pirnas, per- haps a chiefdom or a state. Indeed, it has become apparent that the Classic includes many features, such as an extensive irrigation system, incipient urbanism, craft specialization, monumental archi- tecture, and increased social stratification, all normally associated with civilizations. For one thing, the evidence for craft specializa- tion already appears in the Sedentary period- perhaps earlier- and continues into the Classic. The large numbers of elaborate, exquisitely chipped projectile points recovered from cremations led the late flint-knapping authority Don Crabtree to 28 Archaeology</page><page sequence="8">conclude that these points were chipped by special- ists. Similarly, production of ceramics by specialists is hinted at by pottery manufacturing areas, in- creasingly standardized forms and decoration, and extensive quarries for mica temper. Such spe- cialization seems to continue into the Classic period as the designs of pottery, shell jewelry and stone artifacts become more standardized. The Hohokam built their most enduring monu- ment, the four-story Casa Grande, around A.D. 1350, probably in a major burst of building activity. The most recent interpretations suggest that this structure was multi-purpose, serving as an elite residence, perhaps a storehouse, and an observatory. In fact, there are several "observation holes" in the building through which celestial events of inter- est to an agricultural people, such as the summer and winter solstices, could be tracked. Society also grew more complex as variations in the compounds and villages suggest. Obvi- ously their occupants differed in wealth, power and lifestyle. At Escalante, a village only a few miles from the Casa Grande, most individuals lived in com- pounds consisting of several living and storage rooms arranged around a plaza. Not all compounds, however, were equal in their labor investment; usually at least one rested two to three meters above the others on a large platform mound. In addi- tion, not all villages were equivalent. The main village at the Casa Grande contrasts sharply with Escalante. The great house itself is a huge residence built atop a platform mound, and at least one other multi-storied building existed. Casa Grande appears to have been an administrative and reli- gious center housing an elite that may have controlled numerous villages like Escalante. Los Muertos was perhaps a similar center. On the basis of just such differences, archaeologists have made the case that Classic society consisted of elites and peas- ants. Villages may have been governed by local elites, while suites of villages, perhaps those located on the same canal system, fell under the juris- diction of a principal village. Future studies may help to determine if there was a paramount au- thority-perhaps at Casa Grande or Los Muertos - for an entire river valley or even the Gila-Salt Basin. The rise and fall of the Hohokam presents an intriguing case for students of civilization to ponder. The Hohokam archaeological sequence encompasses an evolutionary development of in- creasing complexity, culminating in the trappings of a complex society. Like all early civilizations, the Hohokam underwent a process of growth- more and larger settlements, a greater variety of artifacts and types of architecture, and integra- tion of villages into ever larger regional systems. Somewhere along the line, however, the Hohokam stalled on the path to civilization. A considerable gulf still separates Classic Hohokam society from what is usually considered "civilization." Although a few village-size colonies may have been estab- lished, the Hohokam possessed no farflung empire. They were artisans and traders, but with the con- spicuous exception of shell, most of their craft items are not found outside the Gila-Salt Basin. Foreign trade objects are also scarce. And other hallmarks of civilization, such as a writing system, cities, and standing armies, seem to be absent. When Lieutenant Manje first heard of "casas grandes," the Hohokam were the stuff of legends. Their majestic villages along the Salt and Gila stood empty. And the probable descendants of the Hohokam- the unassuming Pima- lived in modest pithouse villages, much like their ancestors a millennium before. Floods and drought, revolution, population pressures, political upheavals in Mexico, and salinization of fields are among the ex- planations espoused by archaeologists for the decline of the Hohokam. Although all of these hy- potheses have champions, even today the causes of the Hohokam collapse remain elusive. If archae- ologists could identify the reasons why the Hohokam and many other societies around the world could not sustain growth, then perhaps we would be closer to explaining why a few societies did reach civilization.
