Negative/positive responses to the study or activity 4. Drawbacks/possible problems 5. How to incorporate the activity into existing programs 6. Time used in activity 7.

Common Sense and Testing in English H Alan Purves, chairman, and the Task Force on H Measurement and E valuation in the Study of English Evaluating student performance in English is complex, since the study of English involves not only skills, but also thoughts, feelings, and attitudes. ■ Standardized tests, which have traditionally dealt with only a few easily measurable aspects of English, do not adequately reflect the achievements of students, and yet such tests are more and more relied on by administrators in making policy decisions. In this booklet, NCTE's Task Force on Measurement and Evaluation describes the most common types of standardized English tests, discusses their limitations, and suggests ways teachers can make these limitations known. The Task Force lists criteria for selecting standardized tests in English and for interpreting and using test results, and presents ideas for alternative methods of evaluating achievement in English. Includes a 3-page "Citizen's Edition" which can be H reproduced and distributed to parents and administrators. 40p. 1975. H No. 07737J $1.00 Measures for Research and Evaluation in the English Language Arts Compiled and reviewed by William T. Fagan, Charles R. Cooper, and Julie M. Jensen The purpose of this publication is to inform potential users of more than 100 unpublished measurement instruments in the English language arts, which are either presented by the authors in their entirety or may be ordered in their entirety from ERIC. Such instruments are often obscured in journal articles or doctoral dissertations, and are not readily available to the potential user. It has been noted that researchers working in similar areas frequently are unaware of such instruments and spend much time H duplicating the work of others, and also that ". . . about 70% of all measures, once published, are never used again, even by the researchers themselves." All of the instruments reviewed have been critically assessed for potential use for research. They are divided into seven areas: language development, listening, literature, reading, standard English as a second language or dialect, teacher competency, and writing; and they are indexed H by author, category, and age range. Measures for Research and Evaluation H resulted from the work of The Research Instruments Project (TRIP) of the NCTE Committee on Research. 256p. 1975 (ERIC Clearinghouse on Read- ing and Communication Skills and NCTE Committee on Research). ■ No. 30992J $5.95 ($5.50, member price) National Council of Teachers of English H 1111 Kenyon Road HÊHH Urbana, Illinois 61801</page><page sequence="3">LANGUAGE ARTS INDEX VOLUME 52 Author and Title Index Accountability and the Teaching of Reading, Gordon Peterson, 968.

Goodman, Editor Goodman explains miscue analysis - one of the newer methods of diagnosis available to reading teachers. In analyzing reading miscues the instructor compares expected oral reading responses with observed responses and is thus able to identify specific strengths and weaknesses in the student's reading process. Other contributors discuss applications of miscue analysis in a variety of classroom situations including teacher training, remedial reading classes, college programs in language/reading, inservice workshops, second-language classrooms, and in preparing instructional materials. 1973 (NCTE and ERIC/RCS) No. 3T883J. $2.95 ($2.50, member price).
