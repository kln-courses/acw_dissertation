<plain_text><page sequence="1">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 95 An Introduction to the Prehistory of British Columbia K.R. Fladmark Introduction The aboriginal history of what is now Canada's Pacific province has been a subject of interest almost since initial European contact, when Capt. James Cook noted cultural correspondences between the Maori and the people of Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island. However, formal systematic archaeological studies did not begin until 1938, with Philip Drucker' s program of survey and test excavation along the northern coast of British Columbia (Drucker 1943) and C.E. Borden's first excavations in and around Vancouver (eg., Borden 1950). The beginning of the North Coast Prehistory Project by George MacDonald, and the start of archaeology at Simon Fraser University under Roy Carlson in 1966; the formalization of the Provincial Archaeologist's Office in 1971; and an increase and renewal of archaeology at the University of British Columbia and the Provincial Museum, beginning about 1972, are among some of the more important developments highlighting a period of unprecedented growth and evolution in British Columbia archaeology over about the last fifteen years. Today, there are at least twenty archaeologists possessing M.A.'s or Ph.D.' s employed full-time in British Columbia archaeology, and field work has expanded into virtually every area of the province (see Fladmark 1981a for a further review of the state of British Columbia archaeology during the 1970's). Between 1950 and 1981 about 14,000 sites were recorded in the provincial site file, and at least 150 of them experienced some significant excavation, resulting in about 1,500 published and unpublished reports on the archaeology of British Columbia. Nevertheless, despite an increasingly substantial data base, nobody could yet seriously describe the archaeology of British Columbia as ' 'well-known," particularly to researchers residing outside of the province who lack ready access to unpublished material. There are no modern published syntheses or summaries of the prehistory of the province as a whole and pioneering efforts to integrate even some of its subregions (eg. the Northwest Coast) into general continental schemes of prehistory (eg. Willey and Phillips 1958; Willey 1966) have been hampered by a lack of accessible data. This paper is an initial attempt to draw together the burgeoning information on British Columbia prehistory in the form of a brief summary and trial partial synthesis. Because there are no published precedents for such an endeavour, this can only be a very provisional effort intended more to stimulate and focus discussion than to establish any set of concrete cultural-historical formulations .</page><page sequence="2">96 British Columbia Prehistory Figure 1: Archaeological sites in British Columbia.

Deep Creek* The Land and Its People British Columbia has a total area of 948,000 km2, over 85 percent of which is mountainous, with elevations ranging from sea level to about 3000 m (Figure 1). Coupled with latitudinal and maritime-continental variation, altitudinal zonation leads to a high degree of environmental diversity across the province. This is usually summarized as a series of generalized biogeoclimatic zones (Farley 1979; Figure 2), including basically: (1) The</page><page sequence="4">98 British Columbia Prehistory Figure 2: Generalized Biogeoclimatic Zones of British Columbia (Based on Farley 1979). Coast (CFir and CHem, Figure 2); (2) The relatively dry and open Southern Interior (IFir, PY, Figure 2); and; (3) The closed boreal to subalpine forest of the Central and Northern Interior (CA, SW, SSpr., BSpr.; Figure 2). However, there is considerable internal variability within each of these generalized zones. The ecological diversity of British Columbia coincides with equivalent ethnographic cultural variety, and the province possesses strong representation of three of the "classic" culture areas of North America (Northwest Coast, Plateau, and Subarctic; Figure 3), as well as some peripheral or transitional Plains elements in portions of the eastern Interior. Four of the eight generally recognized aboriginal language families of Canada occur in British Columbia (Athapaskan, Penutian, Salishan and Wakashan), plus several possible language isolates (Voegelin and Voegelin 1966; Krauss and Golia 1981), making a total of at least 34 distinct Native languages spoken in the province (Duff 1964; Figure 4). Cultural differences between the Coast, with its relatively dense population, complex society and elaborate art and architecture, and the Interior, with more dispersed populations and seemingly simpler ways of life, appear to corrrespond to varied subsistence emphases on salmon, other fish (marine and/or fresh- water), terrestrial game (mainly deer), and/or wild plant- foods. All groups did some hunting, fishing and plant collecting, and the requisite technology for the successful exploitation of both fish and land mammals was universally distributed throughout the province. Paleoenvironments Most of British Columbia was glaciated during the Late Wisconsinan maximum, although the intensity and timing of that event is increasingly a matter of debate (cf. Clague, Armstrong and Mathews 1980; Clague 1981; Fladmark 1975a, 1981c; Mathews 1979). On the Southern Coast glaciation climaxed sometime between 17,000 and 14,500 B.P., followed by a rapid retreat, so that trees were growing in the vicinity of Vancouver by about 13,500 B.P. A minor glacial readvance into the Fraser Valley about 11,300 B.P. (Sumas Stade; Armstrong 1981) has yet to be demonstrated of regional significance, and it is likely that most of the outer Northwest Coast at least, was entirely ice-free and inhabitable by 12,000- 13,000 B.P. (eg. Mathews 1979). There is much less information pertaining to the déglaciation of the Interior, particularly northern areas, but it seems probable that any</page><page sequence="5">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 99 Figure 3: Culture Areas and Archaeological Regions of British Columbia. uplands which were ice-covered during the Late Wisconsinan, were becoming exposed by 12,000-13,000 B.P., while valleys were deglaciated by at least 10,000-11,000 B.P. (Clague 1981). Thus it can be assumed that much of British Columbia was ice-free and available for human occupancy by 1 1 ,000 B.P. , while most of the coast at least, would have been open one-two thousand years earlier. Also, arguments presented elsewhere (Fladmark 1979a, 1981c) for a chain of Late Wisconsinan refugia around the North Pacific which might have aided early population infiltration into southern North America, are becoming less speculative with the identification of terrestrial vegetation on the Queen Charlotte Islands dated 15,000-16,000 B.P. (Mathews, pers. comm. 1982), and a possible relict refugium plant assemblage from the Brooks Peninsula on the west coast of Vancouver Island (Hebda, pers. comm. 1982). Likewise, the reality of an "ice-free corridor" along the east flanks of the Rocky Mountains, including portions of the Peace River district of northeastern British Columbia, seems increasingly supported by new data (eg. Mathews 1980). Holocene palynological data from the Interior of British Columbia indicate a xerothermic interval (Hypsithermal) of indeterminate duration, beginning about 10,000 B.P. and terminating between about 6,600 and 3,000 B.P. (Clague 1981; Miller and Anderson 1974). This was superceded by a trend towards cooler and moister conditions culminating in the first Neoglacial ice-advances about 5,000-3,000 years ago (Clague 1981) and the even more intense read vanees of the "Little Ice Age' ' of the last few hundred years. Coastal paleoclimatic sequences, ameliorated by maritime effects, do not generally show a well-market xerothermic interval (eg., Mathewes 1973), although significant glacial readvances in the northern Coast Range indicate increasing cool-moist conditions during the late Holocene (eg., Miller 1976). In general, archaeologists have not yet paid much attention to the possible cultural-ecological significance of the Hypsithermal-Neoglacial transition in British Columbia, between roughly 5,000 and 3,000 B.P. However, particularly in the Interior where lowering snowlines and changes in vegetation zones and drainage characteristics could have altered the resource base of individual valley-mountain systems, the shift towards Neoglacial conditions may be of considerable importance in understanding cultural changes which appear to be occurring at about the same time.</page><page sequence="6">100 British Columbia Prehistory Figure 4: Major Ethnographic Linguistic Units of British Columbia (Based on Duff 1964). On the Coast, Holocene climatic changes do not appear as marked, at least in the pollen record, as in the Interior, although a slow increase in cedar after 6,000 B.P. , peaking about 2,000-3,000 years ago, seems to parallel the Hypsithermal-Neoglacial transition, and may be important in understanding the evolution of Northwest Coast woodworking (Hebda and Mathewes 1982). However, possibly more important to the reconstruction of prehistoric coastal cultural-ecology, are the sequences of late Pleistocene and Holocene sea-level changes. In British Columbia and Southeastern Alaska, most mainland and inner coastal settings experienced very high relative sea levels immediately following glacial retreat, with a trend towards rapid emergence. This culminated in sea levels about 10 m lower than present in the Gulf of Georgia between about 9,000 and 5,500 B.P., with renewed relative submergence bringing the sea level to about its present position ca. 5,000 B.P. (Fladmark 1975a; Clague 1975). The curve from the Queen Charlotte Islands represents an opposite sequence, with a sea level 30-40 m below present before 10,000 B.P., rising to about 15 m higher than present by ca. 9,000 years ago, followed by slow relative re-emergence (Fladmark 1975a; Clague personal communication 1982). Almost all subareas of the Coast, even no more than 100 km apart, display somewhat independent sea level sequences, and no single curve can be considered representative of the entire region. Despite these complexities, past changes in local relative sea level position are obviously critical in determining site location and preservation, and may be the major factor accounting for certain gaps or truncations in local cultural sequences. In addition, significant littoral and riverine environmental changes may have been associated with the attainment and passing of certain local relative sea level thresholds, and general coastal-riverine ecological maturity may have broadly paralleled patterns of sea level stability and instability (eg., Fladmark 1975a, 1981d). Prehistoric Cultural Analytical Units There has been no serious effort to evolve or apply large scale integrative cultural "stage" concepts in British Columbia equivalent to the traditional "Paleoindian, Archaic, Formative (Woodland, Late, Sedentary, etc.)" formulations of central and eastern areas of the continent, and even a semantically neutral subdivision of general provincial prehistory into "Early, Middle and Late" periods has not been generally adopted. It is true that most</page><page sequence="7">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 101 of the "traditional" continental stages would be difficult to formally apply in British Columbia, since: (1) There are only rare examples of definite "classic" Paleoindian materials known, despite the presence of other equivalently early complexes, and; (2) Any attempt to utilize the Archaic concept in British Columbia would encounter difficulties in cultural/temporal boundary definition, since basically the entire known prehistoric cultural sequences of both Coast and Interior could be considered "Archaic", in the sense of lacking ceramics and well developed horticulture, (even though Willey and Phillips, 1958, somewhat reluctantly accept the ethnographic Northwest Coast into their Formative fold). While notions of developed or optimum cultural adaptations to specific regional environments, similar to Caldwell's (1958) concept of Woodlands Archaic "primary forest efficiency," or Jenning's (eg. 1978) Desert Archaic, are inherent in some theorizing about the origins of some British Columbian cultural patterns (eg. Borden 1975; Fladmark 1975a; Stryd 1971a), exact definition and recognition of the archaeological characteristics of such cultural "climaxes" in the Northwest seems elusive. To date, most British Columbia archaeologists have been content with developing and analytically manipulating localized culture sequences whose phases, complexes, traditions, or chronologically arranged components are not intended for broad extension beyond the region of the original study. The result is a large number of mainly independent cultural chronologies (some of which are shown in Figures 6 and 8), with little or no attempt at regional correlation. This is a natural state of affairs for such an environmentally and culturally diverse region, in which systematic archaeology is still at an early stage of development. However, it does cause difficulties for anyone wishing to readily perceive a broad picture of provincial prehistory. I do not intend to propose here any set of "grand synthetic" concepts to rectify this situation - indeed, the cultural and environmental diversity of British Columbia may eventually be shown to defy all simple generalizations, even intra-regionally - however, it is useful to pre-establish some terms to aid the provisional descriptive comparison and correlation of widely separated sites and sequences attempted in the remainder of this paper. In the following pages, Coastal and Interior prehistory will be summarized as separate regions. Coastal sequences will be described in terms of two general periods or stages: (1) Lithic Stage (&gt; ca. 5-5,500 B.P.), and (2) Developmental Stage (ca. 5-5,500 B.P. to contact). The Lithic Stage will be additionally subdivided into Early and Late Substages, while the Developmental Stage will be discussed in terms of Early, Middle and Late Substages. Due to fewer available data, and greater environmental and cultural intra-regional diversity, the prehistory of the Interior will be descriptively summarized in terms of a "traditional" trifold division into "Early, Middle and Late" periods. All these units will be more specifically defined below. Coastal Prehistory Introduction The bulk of archaeological efforts in British Columbia has been focussed on the Coast, particularly the southern areas around current centers of population. The Gulf of Georgia Region (Figure 3) as defined by Mitchell (1971a) comprises the Strait of Georgia and associated mainland, islands and rivers, including the Fraser River as</page><page sequence="8">102 British Columbia Prehistory Figure 5: Archaeological 14C Dates from British Columbia, Plotted by 100 Year Incre- ments. far upstream as the canyon, within about 200 km of the modern cities of Victoria and Vancouver. Many researchers have contributed to the development and refinement of an increasingly detailed cultural sequence for this region spanning about the last 9,000 years (eg. Abbott 1972; Beattie 1972, 1980; Bernick 1977; Blacklaws 1979a; Borden 1950, 1951, 1954a, 1960, 1962, 1968a and b, 1969, 1970, 1975, 1976, 1979; Burley 1979, 1980; Buxton 1969; Calvert 1970; Capes 1964, 1977; Carlson 1960, 1970a; Charlton 1980; Crowe-Swords 1974; Eldridge 1981; Haggarty and Sendey 1976; Hall and Haggarty 1981; Ham 1982; Hanson 1972; Kenney 1974; LeClair 1976; Matson 1974, 1976, 1981; McMurdo 1974; Mitchell 1963, 1965, 1968, 1971a and b, 1979a; Monks 1973, 1977, 1980; Patenaude and Broderick 1981; Percy 1975; Seymour 1976; Trace 1981; Von Krogh 1974, 1980, and others). The Gulf of Georgia is the only region of British Columbia where there exist sufficient temporally controlled data to permit relatively detailed spatial and chronological distributional studies of specific artifact types, and to seriously attempt holistic reconstructions of prehistoric lifeways at a scale larger than the single site (eg., Burley 1980). The preponderance of published data and graduate theses dealing with this region overshadows all other parts of the province and Gulf of Georgia culture history effectively acts as a comparative type- sequence for the entire Coast, although its named cultural-chronological units (phases) are formally applicable only to the local region. Elsewhere on the Coast, significant bodies of data are now available from the Central region, including northern Vancouver Island (eg. Apland 1982; C. Carlson 1979; R. Carlson 1970b, 1972, 1976, 1978, 1979; Carlson and Hobler 1976; Chapman 1982; Conover 1978; Hester and Nelson 1978; Hobler 1972, 1977, 1980, 1982; Leubbers 1978;</page><page sequence="9">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 103 Figure 6: Culture Sequences of the Northwest Coast. Mitchell 1969, 1972, 1979b, 1981; Pomeroy 1980, and others), with the most important site in this area being the deeply stratified Namu locality, with about 10,000 years of more or less continuous occupation (R. Carlson 1979; Hester and Nelson 1978). The west coast of Vancouver Island has much less data available, but cultural materials spanning about the last 4,500 years have been identified (eg., Boehm 1974; Calvert 1980; Carlson and Hobler 1976; Cybulski 1978b; Dewhirst 1978, 1980; Haggarty and Boehm 1974; Haggarty and Crozier 1975; McMillan 1981; McMillan and St. Claire 1975). On the northern Northwest Coast important and extensive excavations in and near Prince Rupert Harbour and along the lower Skeena River since 1967 have yielded a tremendous quantity of data encompassing the last 5,000 years of prehistory (eg. Acheson 1977; Allaire 1978, 1979; Ames 1975, 1979; Coupland 1982; Cybulski 1972, 1974, 1975, 1978a; Inglis 1972, 1973, 1976; Inglis and MacDonald 1975, 1979; MacDonald 1969, 1979; MacDonald and Inglis 1981; and Simonsen 1973). When this material is fully analyzed it should provide cultural detail nearly equal to that from the Gulf of Georgia. On the Queen Charlotte Islands a provisional sequence spanning at least 8,000 years has been roughed out, although much more information is needed (eg. Fladmark 1970, 1973, 1975a, 1979b, n.d.; Gessler 1974; Hobler 1976, 1978; Murray 1981; Severs 1974a and b). Most coastal research to date has concentrated on the investigation of shell-midden sites associated with the present sea level position. This is largely due to the difficulty of locating</page><page sequence="10">104 British Columbia Prehistory non-shell sites in the usually dense forest behind the present beach, but it means that older portions of most local cultural sequences are poorly represented in comparison to the last ca. 5,000 years of prehistory. Another limitation on data recovery is imposed by the nature of the large shell-midden sites, which often contain a tremendous bulk of cultural deposits, four, five or more metres in depth. This makes wide areal exposure of any but the most recent living floors very difficult. Thus, most excavations have tended to be of the "telephone booth" type, with only a relatively few pits or trenches penetrating through the deep midden, resulting in very little information about prehistoric architecture, house floors, village lay-outs, and the overall spatial distribution of intra-site activities. These problems and others, such as understanding processes of midden formation and transformation, are recognized by most coastal archaeologists, who are seeking methods to resolve them (eg. Ham 1982) but, at the moment, the bulk of information available about coastal prehistory consists of artifact and faunal-remain studies, with very little data directly pertaining to prehistoric settlement pattern, demography, or social organization. In the following pages coastal prehistory will be summarized from early to late. The Gulf of Georgia will provide the information core, around which finds in other areas will be organized and compared. The Early Lithic Substage As noted in the section on paleoenvironments, it is probable that most of the Northwest Coast has been ice-free and available for human occupation for about 12,000 years, even barring the possibility of Late Wisconsinan refugia. Thus, depending on one's estimate of the maximum age of man in North America, the oldest dated, definite, cultural assemblages so far known for the Northwest Coast (ca. 9,000-10,000 B.P.) are likely to post-date the original occupation of the area by at least 2,000-3,000 years. Largely for this reason a number of researchers have proposed that certain problematical assemblages, either not radiometrically dated, or lacking in definitive proof of human intervention, may be evidence of the earliest occupations which predictably should be present. All such collections which have been proposed to pre-date 9,000-10,000 B.P. but which have not been definitely dated, are here lumped into a category of convenience termed "Early Lithic." This must be considered a very hypothetical grouping, until dating confirmation becomes available. Such assemblages occur widely scattered along the coast, but probably the best known candidate is the "Pasika Complex," of the Fraser Canyon (Borden 1968b, 1975; Irvine 1973; Mitchell 1965). The Pasika Complex consists of a large collection, primarily of unif acial pebble-tools or cores, in and on surficial sediments of a series of terraces near the town of Yale. The geological context of these finds has yet to be fully established, and contrary to earlier reports, occasional artifact types other than pebble tools do occur in both surface and buried contexts (Borden 1975; Haley 1982; Irvine 1973). A single radiocarbon date of 5240 ± 100 B.P. was rejected by Borden (1975) as being from a burned root system. A number of researchers have been critical of the Pasika Complex, pointing out that pebble tools occur through most of the Later Fraser Canyon sequence and that the dating of these finds, which Borden (1975) estimates at ca. 9,000-12,000 B.P., is inconclusive. Everything apparently hinges on the geological interpretation of the site, including the origin and age of the terraces and other features, and the identification of their surface sediments as aeolian or</page><page sequence="11">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 105 fluvial. If the terraces are of fluvial or glaciofluvial origin; if the artifacts were in situ in such sediments; and if, as Borden (1975) notes, many of them are water worn, then an early age estimate may be justified, since such terraces were possibly formed during a period of significantly higher sea level - therefore before 9,000 B.P. The "pebble tools" themselves may be primarily flake cores (Haley 1982), explaining their distribution over such a large area, as part of a lithic workshop site. Pasika is not the only pebble tool site on the southern coast, several being noted by Grabert (1979) just south of the border in Washington State and others are known for the lower Fraser (eg., Eldridge 1981; Kidd 1968). Small numbers of pebble tools are also sometimes noted in basal sediments of later sites of the area (eg. Archer 1976; Davis 1972; Mitchell, Murray and Carlson 1981; Sutherland 1970). While some of these finds may be intrusive from the later horizons, due to trampling or some kind of "size" effect, the occurrence of water-rounded pebble tools in early Holocene raised beach sediments (Borden 1969a), where overlying sites lack pebble tools, is suggestive of considerable age. Thus it still seems possible that some pre-9,000 B.P. cultures on the southern Coast had a lithic technology including, as one aspect, the reduction of pebble flake cores and perhaps their occasional subsequent use as multi-purpose cutting and scraping tools (cf. R. Carlson 1979, 1981; Grabert 1979). Along most of the British Columbia coast pebble choppers, flake cores, and large tool flakes are relatively frequent occurrences in Late Lithic and Early-Middle Developmental components. However, there are also other finds which suggest greater age. On the Queen Charlotte Islands several occurrences of lithic assemblages within the intertidal zone possibly indicate washed-out sites originally associated with a period of lower sea levels (Hobler 1978). //the sea level curve for the relatively lightly glaciated northern portion of the islands is applicable to the probably more heavily glaciated southern area, where most such sites occur, then they should be somewhat older than 10,000 B.P. Another Charlottes site represents a unique occurrence of a "paleo-intertidal" assemblage. This is the Zone III assemblage of Skoglund's Landing, where a small collection of pebble choppers, flake cores and flakes was found buried 5 - 8 m deep within the gravels of an ancient raised beach (Fladmark 1970; 1979b). This beach was developed by a sea level about 15 m above present, which existed from ca. 9,000 to 4,500 B.P. The water-tumbled artifacts found imbedded down to the lowest levels of the thick beach gravels probably represent an eroded site and/or intermittent beach occupations predating the attainment of the maximum sea level position ca. 8,000-9,000 B.P. This would suggest, along with the intertidal sites described earlier, that people had occupied this rather remote archipelago by ca. 10,000 B.P., prior to the establishment of the maximum Holocene sea level position. Such an occupation may therefore have occurred when sea levels were significantly lower than present, and when the islands were closer to the mainland in terms of minimum water distances. In addition to these pebble-tool assemblages, some mention should also be made of the Manis mastadon site on the south coast of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, opposite Vancouver Island in Washington State. This is radiocarbon dated at about 12,000 B.P. and has been cited as a possible example of an early terrestrial big-game hunting culture in the pacific Northwest (Gustafson, Daugherty and Gilbow 1979; Carlson 1981). However, the only significant indicator of putative human activity of this age at the Manis site is a so-called</page><page sequence="12">106 British Columbia Prehistory 4 'bone point" fragment imbedded in a mastadon rib. Unfortunately there is no proof of cultural modification of this intrusive organic object, and it might represent some kind of natural injury sustained by the animal. It is worth noting in this regard that no now-extinct Pleistocene terrestrial megafauna have ever been positively confirmed from Late Wisconsinan or Holocene contexts along the Northwest Coast, north of the Gulf of Georgia region, and if mastadon hunting was ever carried out in the area, it must have been a very localized and restricted pastime. Perhaps bearing on the same question of early Holocene use of extinct terrestrial megafauna on the Northwest Coast is the rare occurrence of projectile point forms suggestive of "classic" Paleoindian complexes. There has been no published systematic study of such points in British Columbia, and the cultural relationships and age of most of them are unknown. However several examples of elongated lanceolate, concave-based points have been reported from both the Southern and Northern Coast. Most Northern Coast occurrences, centered around the lower Skeena River but also including at least one example from the Queen Charlotte Islands, appear to be relatively recent in age, showing up in the Skeena Complex at Gitaus and Hagwilget on the Skeena River about 3,500 to 4,000 B.P. (Allaire 1979; Ames 1979). The ages of the southern specimens, however, are unknown, and their apparent absence from the ca. 9,000 year long Gulf of Georgia cultural sequence suggests chronological priority. One example was surface collected by Borden near his home on Point Grey in Vancouver (Figure 9a), where there is no geological reason why it could not be as much as 10,000 years old. No fluted points formally equivalent to Clovis or Folsom types have ever been positively identified on the British Columbia Coast, and their definite original association with tidal water anywhere in North America is rare. However, a classic Clovis point has been reported from near Olympia, Washington, about 250 km south of Vancouver (Osborne 1956), so their eventual discovery in the Gulf of Georgia region may not be entirely unexpected. Although occasional "fluted" stemmed, side-notched and lanceolate points turn up in late sites in both the Coast and Interior, the morphologically nearest example of a "Clo vis-like" point from a potentially early context in southwestern British Columbia is a single, possibly basally thinned, lanceolate/leaf- shaped point found with microblades on an eroding beach of the high level Coquitlam Lake Reservoir, near Vancouver (Wright and Williams 1982). However, the "fluting" may only be impact damage (R. Carlson, pers. comm. 1982), and other assemblages containing (unfluted) leaf-shaped points and microblades have been dated ca. 4000-5000 B.P. in the Fraser Valley (eg. LeClair 1976). The Late Lithic Substage (10,000-5,500/5,000 B.P.) This period includes all assemblages from the British Columbia and adjacent coasts, radiocarbon dated between about 10,000 and 5,500 B.P. Principal dated stratified sites in British Columbia include Milliken, Glenrose and DiRi-14 (lower Fraser River), Bear Cove (northern Vancouver Island); Namu (Central Coast) and Lawn Point and Kasta (Queen Charlotte Islands), as well as many other undated, but typologically related assemblages. These collections have generally been divided into two cultural traditions, one on the Northern Coast, and the other in the South, with some degree of overlap in the Central Coast region.</page><page sequence="13">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 107 The South Coast Late Lithic tradition has been variously termed " Protowestern" (Borden 1969b, 1975); "Lithic Culture Type" (Mitchell 1971a); "Old Cordilleran" (Butler 1961; Matson 1976), and "Late Pebble Tool" (R. Carlson 1979, 1981). This lack of terminological consensus reflects differing perspectives and varied confidence in the relative importance of certain traits, and presumed directions and intensity of external relationships. Not wishing to add to this multiplicity of titles, I will follow Matson in referring to these materials as representatives of the "Old Cordilleran Pattern." While it is recognized that several researchers have been unhappy with the way in which the Old Cordilleran concept has been developed and applied in the Northwest (eg. Borden 1975, Nelson 1969), the term is retained here because: (1) it has some historical priority; (2) the early South Coast assemblages are generally compatible with the content of most "Old Cordilleran" collections in the northwestern states (eg. Butler 1961); and, (3) it does not necessarily imply general temporal priority over the entire region, as suggested by the term "Protowestern." Major Old Cordilleran components on the southern British Columbia Coast are dated between ca. 5,500 and 9,000 B.P. and characterized by leaf-shaped and occasionally contracting stem bifaces and points; a flake tool and core industry, including large blade-like flakes and a variety of retouched forms; pebble tools; cortical spalls and rare abrasive stones. Negative traits include the apparent absence of a definite microblade industry, any significant pecked or ground stone, and stone sculpture. Rare, fragmentary examples of partially abraded soft stone and slate are reported (Borden 1968a, 1969, 1975; C. Carlson 1979; Ham 1982; Matson 1976; Mitchell 1971a). Most Lithic Stage sites possess poor organic preservation in acidic soils un-buffered by shell-midden deposits; however, some faunal remains are reported from the Old Cordilleran components at Glenrose and Bear Cove. In the former site a few organic artifacts assigned to the Old Cordilleran occupation include an unusual unilaterally "barbed" antler point or harpoon (Fig. 9d), a bone awl, and several bone and antler wedges (Matson 1976). Old Cordilleran faunal remains from Glenrose are reported to include wapiti, deer, seal, salmon, sturgeon, stickleback, eulachon and shellfish (Imamoto 1976; Matson 1981). However, most organic remains associated with the Glenrose Old Cordilleran component apparently come from some small shell lenses in undated excavation units, and need not necessarily be any older than ca. 5,700 B.P. (Matson 1981). This means that we may not yet have any significant information about the subsistence practises of the earliest occupants of the Glenrose site, radiocarbon dated back to ca. 8,150 B.P. (Matson 1976). Indeed, the presence of small shell lenses, and certain inconsistencies in radiocarbon dates in the upper portion of the Old Cordilleran component at Glenrose (Matson 1976, 1981; Borden 1975), may suggest that some of the organic remains attributed to the Old Cordilleran occupation, including the organic artifacts may date to the early Charles Phase. Faunal remains found in the earliest component at Bear Cove, on the north end of Vancouver Island, include sea mammal (mainly dolphin and porpoise), rock cod, deer, and salmon as the most frequently represented elements (C. Carlson 1979). Again, all organic remains were apparently associated with the upper, undated portions of the ca. 1 m thick "early component" non-shell deposits, which produced a single basal date of 8,020 B.P. (C. Carlson 1979). Overlying shell-midden accumulation began about 4,200 B.P., so all that can be said definitely about the "early" fauna from Bear Cove is that it dates sometime</page><page sequence="14">108 British Columbia Prehistory between 4,200 and 8,020 B.P. Therefore, it need not necessarily be truly "early", or relate to the Old Cordilleran occupation. Little more can be said about the non-subsistence aspects of Old Cordilleran culture on the Southern Northwest Coast. Most site samples of this period are small in area because of the depth of cultural overburden, and it is not possible to estimate accurately the size of Old Cordilleran encampments, although they were probably not large. Most Lithic Stage sites anywhere on the Coast lack definite structural remains, although DiRi-14 on the lower Fraser did yield a 2 x 1 .5 x 1 .0 m pit, as well as a posthole. This pit, containing quantities of quartz crystal flakes and fish vertebrae, was C14 dated to 6,260 ± 160 B.P. (Eldridge 1981 and personal communication 1982). If it can be interpreted as a storage pit, it would suggest stored food surpluses at this time. A poorly preserved pit burial (?) is also reported from the same component (Eldridge 1981). Old Cordilleran subsistence is usually thought to have been initially generalized in orientation, with increasing emphasis on marine and riverine resources through time (eg. Mitchell 1971a). Unfortunately the absence of faunal assemblages clearly associated with the earliest periods makes this assumption difficult to test. The Milliken locality on the Fraser Canyon, which possesses the oldest dated component (9,050 B.P.) on the South Coast, is inferred by Borden (1975) to be a salmon fishing site on the basis of its location, the occurrence of some charred wild cherry pits which ripen in late summer at the time of the largest salmon run, and the presence of numerous salmon bones at a contemporary site on the lower Columbia River (Borden 1975; Cressman 1960). The northernmost occurrence of a relatively pure Old Cordilleran component on the Coast is the Bear Cove site on northern Vancouver Island, while southwards the pattern extends well into the Columbia basin. Its distribution notheast wards into the Fraser Plateau is unclear at the moment, although some components from the area have been described as "Old Cordilleran." Problems inherent in such attributions will be noted in the section on Interior prehistory. North of Vancouver Island, along the mainland coast but particularly on offshore islands, another apparently distinctive Late Lithic tradition is reported. This has been termed the "Early Boreal Tradition" (Borden 1969, 1975), the "Early Coast Microblade Complex" (Fladmark 1975a), and the "Microblade Tradition" (R. Carlson 1979, 1981). I will continue to use "Early Coast Microblade Complex" as a designator for coastal assemblages radiocarbon dated ca. 5,500/5,000-10,000 B.P., and characterized by a microblade industry (Fig. 9c); flake cores, including "pebble tools"; a variety of retouched flake tools; rare crude leaf-shaped bifaces (not always present); rare abrasive stones; rare possible ground or notched sinker stones; and non-shell site contexts. The descriptive title "Early Coast Microblade Complex" is preferred over "Early Boreal" (Borden 1975), because it does not pre -judge the origins and relationships of this complex, which Borden always felt lay in the northern Interior. The modifier "Early Coast" also serves to distinguish this technologically distinctive complex from other microblade "traditions" - often non- coastal and/or relatively later in age - found in British Columbia and adjacent areas. The oldest dated British Columbian site containing Early Coast Microblade Complex materials is the deeply stratified Namu locality, on the Central mainland coast just north of Vancouver Island (R. Carlson 1978, 1979; Hester and Nelson 1978). Here Carlson recognizes two early non-shell stratigraphie units - Ila and lib - underlying later thick shell-midden deposits. Reported radiocarbon dates range from 9,720 ± 140 to 7,800 ± 200</page><page sequence="15">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 109 for Zone Ha, and 6,060 ± 100 to 5,170 ± 190 for Zone lib (R. Carlson 1979), although other dates recently obtained may close the apparent chronological gap between these units (Carlson personal communication 1982). The distinction between the two early zones is important since it was apparently not recognized in earlier work at the site (Hester 1978). Carlson (1981) reports that microblades may be more important in the later Zone lib assemblage than in the earlier level, and that all faunal remains previously reported from the Early Namu deposits (Conover 1978) come from the later sub-unit, where a single small shell lens promoted organic preservation. Much attention has been focussed on this presumed early faunal assemblage from Namu, which includes canid (dog?), deer, seal, sea-lion, sea-otter and dolphin or porpoise (Borden 1975; Conover 1978; Mathews 1979), but Carlson's réévaluation indicates that it post-dates the earliest occupation of this site by about 3,700 years. Thus, as for the Southern Coast, there are apparently still no organic remains positively associated with the earliest dated cultural components. Other dated occurrences of the North Coast Microblade Complex include Lawn Point and Kasta on the Queen Charlotte Islands (Fladmark 1971, 1975a, 1979b, n.d.). These multi-component sites are associated with raised beach and esturine deposits of the Holocene sea level maximum and are radiocarbon dated between ca. 7,400 and 5,500 B.P. They possess no shell-midden of any age and entirely lack organic materials other than charcoal. Artifacts include a rich microblade industry mainly based on split pebble cores, pebble flake cores, a variety of unifacially retouched flakes, rare abrasive stones and one possible crudely notched sinker stone - bifaces of any kind are entirely absent, despite substantial samples of other lithic artifacts. These assemblages have been grouped into the Moresby Tradition of the provisional Queen Charlotte Islands sequence (Fig. 6) (Fladmark 1975a, 1979b, n.d.). Although scattered undated microblade occurrences are reported along the lower Skeena River (Acheson 1977; Coupland 1982), the northen mainland coast of British Columbia still lacks any sites dated older than ca. 5,000 B.P. This absence probably reflects relatively lower sea levels between ca. 9,000 and 5,000 B.P. in this area, and the submergence of most early inner coastal sites. However, the outer islands of the Alexander Archipelago of Southeast Alaska, and the Alaskan mainland coast north of the archipelago possess several early microblade components, generally technologically comparable to the Moresby Tradition and early Namu (Davis 1979; Ackerman, Hamilton and Stuckenrath 1979). There is, as well, a distribution of early blade industries around the Gulf of Alaska, predating 5,000-6,000 B.P. (eg. Clark 1979, Dumond 1977; Henn 1978). Southwards, apparent elements of the Early Coast Microblade Complex occur in undated sites on the inner west coast of Vancouver Island, where they seem mixed with Old Cordilleran-like bifaces (McMillan 1981), but do not penetrate strongly into the Gulf of Georgia region. At the moment, it seems that the principal cultural ties and origins of the Early Coast Microblade Complex must be presumed to lie to the north along the coast, since there is no firm evidence yet of comparably dated microblade occurrences in the Northern Interior of British Columbia. Late Lithic manifestations on the Central and Northern Coast of British Columbia are characterized by certain distinctive technological characteristics (i.e., microblade and flake industries), but little is known about settlement and subsistence patterns, or other traits. A large suite of non-preserved organic artifacts is almost certainly lacking from the known</page><page sequence="16">110 British Columbia Prehistory artifact inventory, as well as faunal remains clearly attributable to the earliest periods. The Charlottes campsites were apparently small in area, with thin cultural deposits probably representing successive short term reoccupations of active beaches and river mouths. There is a general lack of cultural features, including the scatters of firecracked rock so common in later sites. These site characteristics and locations suggest small mobile groups oriented to littoral and esturine resources. Their presence on the Queen Charlotte Islands and Alexander Archipelago suggests possesion of efficient watercraft, though dependent on the ultimate age of human occupation of the Charlottes, the task of originally reaching these now isolated islands may have been eased prior to 10,000 B.P. by lowered sea levels and a reduced water gap to the mainland. Namu is a much larger site than any on the Charlottes, and the up-to-1 m thick deposits of Zone II seem to indicate relatively intense cultural (non-shell) midden accumulation (i.e. ca. 2 cm of final decayed, compacted, cultural end-product every 100 years), even at this early period. If the full areal extent of the early Namu deposits (ca. 2000 m2, R. Carlson 1979: Figure 2) was ever occupied at one time, it was a fairly substantial settlement. However, no house remains or other structural features have yet been reported. The Developmental Stage (5,000/5,500 B.P. to Contact) All large concentrated shell-midden deposits on the Northwest Coast, from the Aleutian Islands to northern California, post-date 5,000 B.P. and the vast majority have basal dates around 4,000-4,500 B.P. (cf. Fladmark 1975a). Such sites are routinely deep, complexly stratified, and possess a great diversity of cultural products in a wide range of raw materials. However, not all sites occupied in the last ca. 5,000 years are necessarily large shell-middens, nor do all pre-5,000 B.P. sites entirely lack evidence of shell. The Developmental Stage of Northwest Coast prehistory includes all sites dated later than 5,500 B.P. possessing evidence of development towards the ethnographic cultural pattern, including increased artifact diversification, the appearance of specialized fishing and sea-mammal hunting technology, woodworking, large houses, wealth-status objects, art, and large population aggregates. The great number of sites and vastly increased quantities of data from this period prohibit detailed description in this paper, and the following section will outline the evolution of the above characteristics in terms of coastwide Early, Middle and Late Developmental substages. The bulk of available data comes from the Gulf of Georgia region, but generally similar traits seem to occur at about the same time all along at least the mainland coast. The Early Developmental substage is probably best represented by the Charles Phase of the Gulf of Georgia region dated ca. 5,500-3,500 B.P. (Borden 1975; Ham 1982), although Namu, the Prince Rupert-Skeena area, Yuquot, and a few other localities have equivalently aged finds. The Early Developmental period sees the first notable appearance of ground stone tools, including flaked and ground slate projectiles and ground slate knives in the Gulf of Georgia, although individual sites often show considerable variability in the importance of slate grinding (Borden 1968a, 1975; Carlson 1970; Cal vert 1970; Matson 1976; Ham 1982). Rare ground slate projectiles are also reported from Prince Rupert Harbour Period III dated ca. 5,000-3,500 B.P. (MacDonald and Inglis 1981), and from the earliest occupation of Gitaus on the Skeena River (Allaire 1979). At Namu, two large</page><page sequence="17">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 111 well-made ground and polished stone "celts" are reported from early shell-midden levels dated back to about 5,000 B.P. (Leubbers 1978), although R. Carlson (personal communication 1982) suggests that they probably do not pre-date 3,500 B.P. Ground slate Figure 7: Selected Artifact Chronologies, Gulf of Georgia, British Columbia. is apparently rare at any time on the Central Coast (Leubbers 1978; Hester 1978). Some decorated stone and rare stone ornaments also appear in the Early Developmental period (Matson 1976; Allaire 1979), including distinctively formed small spindle-like objects of steatite and bone from the Charles Phase, which may represent grubs or insect larvae (eg. Borden 1968a; Cal vert 1970). Carlson (1970) also reports small pin-shaped "novice" labrets of soft stone from the late Charles (Mayne) Phase occupation at the Helen Point site in the Gulf of Georgia. Flaked stone industries continue in all areas into the Early Developmental period, including leaf-shaped projectile points, and pebble tools (Matson 1976, MacDonald and Inglis 1981). However, bifaces of any sort remain very rare on the</page><page sequence="18">1 12 British Columbia Prehistory Queen Charlotte Islands and outer west coast of Vancouver Island throughout the entire sequence. In addition to some continuity of older elements, Gulf of Georgia lithic industries see the introduction of microblades at this time, albeit usually based on small quartz crystal and obsidian pebble cores (Mitchell 1968), quite different from those of the North Coast Lithic Stage, or the Plateau Microblade Tradition (eg., Sanger 1968a). Most South Coast "microblades" appear to be primarily products of a bipolar percussion industry (eg., Flenniken 1981; Ham 1982) and the strong presence of a late prepared blade-core industry on the South Coast may be debatable. Other additions to the flaked stone inventory of the South Coast include significant numbers of medium sized contracting stem or "diamond- shaped" points (eg., Carlson 1970). On the Central and Northern mainland Coast, the early microblade industry ceased by the beginning of the Developmental Stage, although on the Queen Charlotte Islands a system of bipolar core reduction appears to replace the earlier prepared core technology by ca. 4,500 B.P. and continues into the early historic period (Fladmark 1970, 1973, 1979b). Organic preservation in Developmental Stage shell-middens is much improved over that of earlier sites. During the Early Developmental Substage we get the first definite appearance of fishing and sea-mammal hunting technology, including the first true harpoons on the British Columbia Coast (the one Glenrose possible Old Cordilleran example may actually be a barbed fixed-point), with multiply bilaterally barbed antler types being typical of the ca. 5,000-3,500 B.P. period in most areas (eg. Carlson 1970; Leubbers 1978; MacDonald and Inglis 1981 - Figure 9f). In addition, there occur many types of bone barbed fixed-points, plain points, awls, and pendants; antler wedges; rare mussel-shell adze blades; and rare sculpture in organic materials. The latter includes a particularly fine antler haft from Glenrose, carved in the form of a human figure with pendulous ear-lobes, a flanged or flaring hairdo or headgear, prominent continuous Y-shaped nose and eyebrows, and a sharply pointed chin suggestive of a beard (Fig. 9b). The back is channeled, perhaps to receive the beaver-tooth bit of a carving tool. Stylistically this figure bears little clear relationship to historic Northwest Coast art, but does confirm the existence of a sophisticated sculptural tradition on the Northwest Coast for over 4,000 years. Good organic preservation in shell-middens also permits recovery of substantial samples of faunal remains. The few analyzed Early Developmental Period components show quantities offish, including salmon and molluscs, land mammals, birds, and sea mammals (eg., Matson 1981; Conoyer 1978; Boehm 1973). A few extended burials have been reported from Charles Phase components (eg. Beattie 1980; Carlson 1970), including examples of artificial cranial deformation and cairn burial (Monks 1977). Elsewhere on the coast most reported burials appear to post-date the Early Developmental Substage (eg., MacDonald and Inglis 1981). Structural features are reported from several Early Developmental period components, including relatively small post-holes, and rock lined hearths and pits. At the Mauer Site, in the Fraser Valley about 90 km east of Vancouver, LeClair (1976) describes the excavation of a complete rectangular semi-subterranean house dated about 4,000-5,000 B.P. It possessed a rectangular central depression 7. 5x5x0. 3m with a hearth at the south end, surrounded by a 2.5 - 2.0 m wide bench. Six relatively large post moulds occupied the corners and mid-lateral positions of the central depression and 19 (angled?) post moulds</page><page sequence="19">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 113 were spaced around the outside of the bench. LeClair (1976) suggests sloping side walls rising about 2 m to a flat roof, with walls and roof originally earth covered. Access was thought to have been gained through an east wall side entrance, and the house apparently burned after abandonment. This is the only entirely excavated prehistoric house floor from the British Columbia Coast, and one of the oldest dated definite habitation structures in the province. If the reported, but unfortunately unillustrated, description is accurate, the Mauer house was unlike normal ethnographic habitations of the South Coast, although it may have partially resembled some "forts" or refuges occasionally built underground (cf. Barnett 1955; Smith 1947). Middle Developmental Substage The Middle Developmental period on the British Columbia Coast (ca. 3,500-1,500 B.P.) sees the full attainment of a general Northwest Coast cultural pattern, although there are often differences of detail compared to ethnographic cultures. During this period we witness the gradual appearance of the complete Northwest Coast woodworking tool kit; large plank houses; numerous art objects, suggestive of complex ideology and craft specialization; frequent ornaments, exotic goods and other primitive valuables indicating a concern with wealth accumulation and display; increased evidence of status differentiation in burials; the full development of complex and diversified fishing and sea-mammal hunting equipment generally similar to that of the ethnographic period; evidence of significant population aggregates, and the first strong indications of warfare. On the Southern Coast, the Middle Developmental period is exemplified by the Marpole Phase, ca. 1,500-2,500 B.P., with the preceding Locarno Beach Phase (ca. 2,500-3,500 B.P.) possibly representing a transition between Marpole and the Early Developmetal period (Charles Phase). A valuable integrative reconstruction of Marpole culture has recently been published by Burley (1980), and the South Coast data must dominate any discussion of the Middle Developmental period, at least until full reporting of the Prince Rupert sites. However, assemblages roughly comparable to Marpole in terms of the general cultural achievements outlined above also occur on most of the Central and Northern Coast. A dominant feature of Middle Developmental period sites is increased artifact and trait diversity and elaboration. While many artifact types persist from earlier periods, they tend to be developed and diversified beyond the previous range of variation. For instance, flaked stone projectile points associated with Marpole include a great variety of triangular stemmed, notched and semi-lanceolate forms, in addition to persistence of older leaf-shaped and contracting stemmed styles. Also a few very large, carefully flaked, serrated-edged bifaces suggest that even the stone flaking industry was involved in production of non-functional wealth or status goods (Borden 1970; Burley 1980; Mitchell 1971a). Occasional pebble tools and large flake cores persist into this period, as does the Gulf of Georgia quartz-crystal "microblade" industry. At Namu the same general time period sees the appearance of large well-made leaf-shaped and lanceolate points associated with elaborate burials (Leubbers 1978), while the Prince Rupert Period II assemblages experience peak occurrences of all flaked stone materials, except for pebble tools, which begin to diminish in frequency (MacDonald and Inglis 1981). Ground and polished stone points, knives, and ornaments also attain a high frequency and diversity relative to earlier periods in most areas except the central coast at this time. This</page><page sequence="20">1 14 British Columbia Prehistory includes occasional very large "bayonet "-like points of ground slate (one from Musqueam Northeast measured 38.7 cm long - Borden and Archer 1974) and a wide range of other triangular, stemmed and leaf-shaped ground slate points in Locarno and Marpole components. Labrets, earspools, atlatl weights, beads, other ornaments, sculpture, and unidentifiable objects made of steatite, lignite and other softstones are features of the Marpole and Locarno Phases. The heavy pecked and ground stone industry includes bowls and hand-mauls, with or without anthropomorphic and zoomorphic decoration, in southern assemblages, while northern collections possess pecked and ground stone clubs, sinkers and anchors. Ground stone adzes are found in all areas by the beginning of the Middle Developmental Period, and hand mauls occur by its end in the south, signalling the full appearance, in conjunction with wedges, of the ethnographic heavy woodworking technology. Stone sculpture probably attains a peak of quantity and excellence on the South Coast during the Marpole Phase, including the famous "seated human figure bowls" (cf. Duff 1956; Figure 10). The full variety of cultural manufactures in organic materials during the Middle Developmental Substage cannot be seriously addressed in this short paper. A wide range of barbed fixed points and harpoons, mostly unilaterally barbed (Figure 9g); occasional single-piece and composite toggling harpoons (Figure 9e); a great variety of simple bone points; "daggers"; wedges; eyed needles; awls; pendants and decorated pieces, and other bone and antler artifacts occur in all areas (eg., Borden 1970; Burley 1980; Ham 1982; Leubbers 1978; MacDonald and Inglis 1981; Matson 1976; Mitchell 1971a). Antler sculpture, anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and more rarely geometric (eg., Severs 1974a, b) reaches an apparent peak at this time. Shell adze blades, knives, end-blades and beads provide proverbial needles-in-the-haystack for excavators of Middle Developmental shell-midden sites. Basketry cordage, fish-nets, bent wood boxes, some decorated bowls, canoe paddles, wood wedges, clubs, and masses of wood chips and splinters from a few waterlogged sites give a hint of the richness of such materials normally not found archaeologically (Inglis 1976; Bernick 1977; Borden 1976). Burials are frequent constituents of Middle Developmental midden sites. Most are single interments with few inclusions; however, occasional relatively elaborate burials have been located, with rich grave goods including weapons, ornaments, decorated objects; animals (eg. dogs or other animal parts) and exotic materials (eg. native copper or amber). Head deformation occurs on the South Coast, while rare cremations, cairn burials, multiple interments, secondary interments, modified human bones, and simply scattered human body parts, occur in all areas (eg. Beattie 1980; Cybulski 1972, 1973, 1978; Hall and Haggarty 1981). Undated burial mounds of varying size, some with stone cysts, found on the South Coast may also belong to this period (eg. Pickford 1947). The range of burial inclusions and the practise of artificial skull deformation strongly suggests a ranked, wealth-conscious society. A high frequency of traumatic arm and skull fractures indicates warfare among at least Prince Rupert Harbour populations at this time, as does the occurrence of single-piece stone and whalebone clubs (MacDonald and Inglis 1981). Large post-holes and segments of house floors show the presence of large plank houses on the North and South Coasts probably similar to those of the ethnographic period, by at least the end of the Middle Developmental Substage. Circular pit-houses of Plateau type also occur along the lower Fraser River by ca. 2,500 B.P. (Hanson 1972; Von Krogh 1980),</page><page sequence="21">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 115 while a ' 'village" of elongated rectangular house depressions, possibly dated as early as 3,000-3,500 B.P. has been recently reported for the lower Skeena River (Coupland 1982). Unfortunately the depth of cultural overburden and other overriding research goals has prevented any extensive exposure of prehistoric houses found in shell-midden sites. Most Middle Developmenal sites are large and deep, reflecting very rapid cultural deposition at this time (eg., Mac Donald and Inglis 1981). Plotting of radiocarbon dates from the coast (Figure 5) suggests a peak in cultural activity between about 1,500 and 3,000 B.P., with a possible earlier peak around 4,000 B.P. While radiocarbon dates cannot, of course, be directly correlated with past population, the frequency of dated site/levels may be a rough measure of the relative density of aboriginal occupation through time. Late Developmental Substage This period encompasses all post- 1,500 B.P. coastal assemblages which can be more or less confidently associated with the ethnographic inhabitants of the area. On the Southern Coast this includes the ' 'Developed Coast Salisti" Phase, or Pattern, a term coming increasingly to the fore (eg. Ham 1982) as a replacement for a previous multiplicity of phase names, all referring to basically the same complex (Stselax - Borden 1954; San Juan - Carlson 1960; Gulf of Georgia Culture Type - Mitchell 1971a). On the Central Coast this substage includes late Namu components, the Anutcix and Kwatna Phases of the Bella Coola area (Carlson 1972, 1976; Hester and Nelson 1978), and Yuquot Zone III and Shoemaker Bay II on the west coast of Vancouver Is. (Dewhirst 1980, McMillan and St. Claire 1975). On the North Coast, Prince Rupert Harbour Period I, can also be assigned to the Late Developmental Substage (MacDonald and Inglis 1981). I do not intend to describe these assemblages in any detail since a reasonable, although incomplete, idea of their content could be gleaned from ethnographic descriptions of Northwest Coast culture. Here, I will simply point out some ways in which the latest regional substage of Coastal prehistory appears to differ from its antecedents. On the North Coast, the general effect of the transition to the Late Developmental Substage seems to be a net accretion of a number of new elements on top of earlier complexes. Innovations include pecked and ground hafted mauls, stone splitting adzes, stone bowls and stirrup-shaped bark-shredders, both plain and zoomorphically decorated; composite toggling harpoons; bone combs and pins; and ground slate "mirrors". Earlier elements dropped from the inventory at this time include ground slate daggers, bilaterally barbed harpoons, and unilaterally barbed harpoons with line-guards (MacDonald 1969; MacDonald and Inglis 1981). Art styles are by now clearly stylistically linked to those of the ethnographic Northern Northwest Coast. In the Gulf of Georgia Region, the Developed Coast Salish Phase is marked by an apparent decline in assemblage diversity compared to the Marpole "climax", although some new elements are added at the same time as old traits disappear. Effective deletions include most of the flaked stone industry by the time of historic contact, with only side-notched and stemmed arrow points, and a few bipolar cores and flake cores persisting well into the late substage (Charlton 1981; Crowe-swords 1974; Ham 1982). Large ground slate points are replaced by relatively small triangular harpoon end-blades and rarer small side-notched ground slate arrow-points. Thin ground slate knives, probably used for fish</page><page sequence="22">116 British Columbia Prehistory filletting or, much less plausibly, for plant-food processing (Burley 1980; Crowe-Swords 1974), persist with little change from the Marpole Phase. Nephrite adzes, antler wedges, and pecked-and-ground stone hand-mauls also continue, but with some slight stylistic changes. A notable loss from late assemblages is most of the stone carving industry, including stone sculpture, labrets, ornaments and other steatite products (except for the innovation of relatively rare steatite pipes), although a few carved bowls apparently similar to seated-human- figure bowls were in use within the memory of historical informants (Duff 1956). A partial replacement for what appears to be diminished output in the sculptural arts is offered by the appearance of the Salish weaving complex during this period, accompanied by occasional carved spindle whorls, including at least one of steatite, and decorated blanket pins (Borden 1968a, 1970; Charlton 1980; Mitchell 1971a). Barbed harpoons disappear, to be replaced by composite toggling harpoons of varying size and form. Ubiquitous elements of most late period sites on the South Coast are bone bipoints - like thick bone toothpicks - which armed a variety of fishing implements. At Namu, there is also an apparent overall decline in assemblage diversity in the latest components, with the addition of occasional new elements (Luebbers 1978; Hester 1978). House types associated with the Late Developmental Substage on the Southern Coast appear to be similar to the standard ethnographic Coast Salish plank house. Cultural deposits in the floor of a traditional house still standing on the Musqueam Indian Reserve in Vancouver as late as 1964 were the locus of Borden' s excavations in which he first defined the late "Stselax" Phase (eg., Borden 1951). Standard ethnographic house types are also generally inferred for other parts of the Northwest Coast at this time, although all extensively excavated examples fall into the historic or proto-historic time frame (eg., Fladmark 1973; Gessler 1974; Hobler 1972; Inglis 1972). New types of structural features which may first occur on the Southern Northwest Coast in the early part of the Developed Coast Salish Phase, are earthwork fortifications (eg. Mitchell 1969b). These features occur around the Gulf of Georgia, and the west coast of Vancouver Island often consisting of one or more sets of trenches and embankments cutting off a peninsula or spit of land from the mainland. These are most probably fortifications (although Buxton 1969 argues that they were salmon drying enclosures), which may reflect intensifying or changing patterns of warfare at this time. Other types of fortified sites and refuges are known all along the ethnographic Northwest Coast, but to my knowledge none north of Vancouver Island have yet been demonstrated to be prehistoric in age (MacDonald 1979; Mitchell 1969a). Midden burials are generally less common in the Late Developmental than in the Middle Developmental Substage, everywhere along the coast (eg. Borden 1970; MacDonald and Inglis 1981). This may reflect changes towards cave, tree, mortuary pole or mortuary house burials at this time. Coastal Prehistory: Discussion The preceding summary attempted to introduce a brief and generalized overview of the prehistory of the British Columbia Coast. Much detail was of necessity glossed over, and many sites and sub-regions left undescribed. In particular, the Developmental Stage of the West Coast of Vancouver Island, and the Queen Charlotte Islands has not been seriously covered. In part this is due to a relative lack of published descriptive data for the latter area</page><page sequence="23">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 117 at least, but also because the little currently known of the prehistory of the outer coast suggests that it may not always have closely paralleled the cultural patterns and processes of the inner and mainland coast. For example, flaked stone is almost completely absent from the ca. 4,500 years of prehistory at Yuquot (Dewhirst 1980), while on the Charlottes there are tentative suggestions of two rather different cultural complexes co-existing between about 4,500 and 2,500 B.P. (the "Transitional Complex" and the Graham Tradition: Fladmark 1975, 1979b, n.d.). Full integration of these insular areas with the rest of coastal prehistory must await more research. In comparison to the outer islands, the prehistoric sequence of the entire mainland coast, at least over the last ca. 5,000-5,500 years, appears sufficiently similar both in terms of general content, synchroneity and direction of cultural change, to permit its provisional description and integration at a regional level, without denying the existence of many differences in cultural detail north to south. In this section I propose to discuss briefly some of the implications generated by use of a cultural analytical framework which emphasizes regional cultural continuity in space, and parallel regional processual trends through time, rather than discrete and unintegrated local sequences. In assessing the Lithic Stage, two principal questions come to mind: (1) What is the cultural significance of the apparent geographic localization and separation of two equally early but apparently different lithic technocomplexes - the Old Cordilleran Pattern and Early Coast Microblade Complex, and (2) What was the nature of the earliest cultural adaptations to the Northwest Coast? In considering these questions it is important to remember that the oldest Late Lithic Stage assemblages so far identified (ca. 10,000 B.P.) are probably about 2,000 years younger than the first occupations of the region, given even a conservative estimate of the age of déglaciation. Thus, the known complexes which we perceive as "the earliest", at the moment, are probably the culmination of a considerable span of prior adaptation to the local region. Certainly, until there have been negative results from a systematic search of high level shorelines along the inner coast, and submerged Strandlines and other areas of the outer coast, the existence of earlier cultures must be considered likely; a probability supported, but not yet proven, by the undated Early Lithic Substage sites. The fact that currently known archaeological sequences are truncated at 9,000-10,000 B.P. is a perfectly predictable outcome of changing Holocene sea levels which first reached their present base about 9,000- 10,000 B.P. If we accept the theoretical likelihood of pre-10,000 B.P. occupations of the Northwest Coast, then it becomes conceivable that all known Late Lithic traditions are simply regional variants, evolved through 2000 years or more of separation, from a hypothetical single basal coastal culture. In that case, the southern (Old Cordilleran) facies, dispersed inland along the Columbia and Fraser drainages, represents an increasing adaptation to a more Interior-oriented riverine and land-mammal hunting lifestyle (without necessarily abandon- ing original basic interests in fishing for salmon and other species), while the northern facies (Early Coast Microblade Complex), which mainly lacked access to major river corridors inland, maintained and developed the early generalized maritime orientation. Most previous descriptions of Lithic Stage traditions of the Northwest Coast have emphasized apparent differences between the Old Cordilleran and Early Coast Microblade technocomplexes. However, it is also possible to don a "lumper's" hat (cf. Dumond 1974), and point out that there may be considerably more technological similarities between</page><page sequence="24">1 18 British Columbia Prehistory these complexes than differences. For instance, both are quantitatively dominated by a pebble-based flake-core system, which produced a variety of tool-flakes, some of which were used without modification, while others were unifacially retouched, and which also resulted in distinctive remnant core-nuclei (i.e., "pebble tools"), which may also have had a variety of uses. In fact, the only real differences between an Old Cordilleran component and a component of the Early Coast Microblade Complex is the presence of a definite microblade industry in the latter, and definite bifacially flaked projectile points in the former. However, it is worth pointing out that some leaf-shaped bifaces occur in all known mainland components of the Early Coast Microblade Complex (eg. Namu; Groundhog Bay, and perhaps also including Ugashik Narrows, Alaska - Ackerman 1974; Henn 1978; Leubbers 1978), while only insular components lack bifaces (The Queen Charlottes; Hidden Falls; and, greatly stretching the definition of the complex, Anangula on the Aleutian Islands). Perhaps the lack of bifaces in insular contexts again merely reflects the result of 2,000 years or more of isolation in specialized maritime settings, where land mammal hunting was necessarily of relatively little importance. In addition, while there are no "true" microblade cores reported from Old Cordilleran Components of the Southern Coast, "microblade-like" and "macroblade-like" flakes do occur, particularly in the Milliken assemblage (Borden 1968a; Eldridge 1981). One wonders how our perception of these complexes might have evolved if Borden had chosen to argue that the Milliken- Mazama Phase blade-like flakes were, in fact, evidence of an early microblade industry at this site - I believe that at one time he was considering it. Certainly that collection of small parallel-sided ridge-flakes is not substantially less blade-like than some other samples which have been classified as "microblades" in the Pacific Northwest. If the Old Cordilleran and Early Coast Microblade complexes did not evolve from a common Coastal progenitor, then alternatively, they may represent two different cultural infusions onto the Northwest Coast: the Early Coast Microblade Complex coming from the north via either the Northern Interior (Borden 1969b, 1975, 1979), or Coast (Fladmark 1975a); and the Old Cordilleran Pattern derived from a Southern Interior origin (eg. Borden 1969b, 1975; Fladmark 1975a; Mitchell 1971a). At this moment I prefer the hypothesis of a common early Coastal ancestor for both Old Cordilleran and Early Coast Microblade Complexes in British Columbia, but if direct well-dated evidence for this continues to elude us after conceited efforts to search for it in appropriate geomorphic contexts, then the older concept of separate northern and southern origins will strengthened. The second major question concerns the nature of Lithic Stage cultural adaptations to the Northwest Coast. This is a critical problem since clear perception of the basal life way s of the region must be essential to any effort to reconstruct accurately the evolution of the complex societies which characterize the later periods. Thus, if the first residents of the Northwest Coast were already maritime orientated, perhaps through long prior adaptation to North Pacific environments in Beringia or northeast Asia, then it is unnecessary to argue for significant periods of in situ adaptation and learned adjustment to the British Columbia Coast. Such first-comers would already have been familiar with the natural resources of the region, such as sea-mammals and salmon, and probably already possessed technological and social strategies for their effective exploitation, including generalized fishing equipment and storage-preservation procedures. If on the other hand, the initial occupants penetrated rapidly out to the Coast from one or more Interior homelands, then probably</page><page sequence="25">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 119 some period of adjustment would have been required before a comfortable subsistence was attained. Nevertheless, even this period of transition need not have been long, or requiring great modification of existing cultural systems, since at least two of the essential elements of coastal life (shellfish and salmon) would have also been familiar to original dwellers of the Columbia or Fraser Plateaus. Unfortunately, the lack of food remains and organic artifacts (which would include most fishing and sea-mammal hunting equipment) definitely attributable to the earliest dated occupations of the Northwest Coast means that we have no clear understanding of their subsistence orientation, or their actual degree of maritime and/or riverine-terrestrial adaptation, beyond the indirect inferences suggested by site locations and lithic artifacts. The boundary between the Lithic and Developmental Stages presents a set of problems analogous to those of Archaic-Formative transitions in other regions. It is equally possible to adopt a "discontinuity" perspective and say that the transition represents a significant cultural shift, or argue for "continuity", in which the transition is seen as merely an arbitrary analytical boundary imposed on a long sequence of gradual trait accumulation and modification through time. There are several difficulties hampering understanding of this period. One is the fact that continuous cultural sequences fully spanning the critical years between ca. 6,500 to 5,000 B.P. are rare. While a very few coastal radiocarbon dates fall into this time, in most areas there is some gap or inadequacy in the cultural record right at the crucial transition between Lithic and Developmental cultures. This gap may have something to do with sea levels which were stabilizing near their present position at this time. Whatever the cause it seems improbable that there was ever any significant hiatus in occupation of the Coast, but the repeated occurrence of a similar problem in most coastal culture sequences (Fig. 6) may indicate that some significant regional environmental or settlement pattern changes were taking place at this time. A second problem is raised by the very different preservation qualities of the earlier non-shell and later shell-midden deposits. As a result of acidic soils we are left with mainly only "lithic" artifacts before ca. 5,000 B.P., in comparison to a plethora of bone, antler and shell artifacts afterwards. This causes serious comparative difficulties and makes early assemblages seem much more "primitive" and unspecialized than they probably really were. One of the most obvious real changes across the Lithic/Developmental transition is the shift to shell-midden site accumulations. No large concentrated shell-midden deposit has yet been convincingly dated older than about 5,000 B.P. anywhere on the North Pacific Coast, and most have basal dates of about 4,500 B.P. In an earlier paper I discussed possible reasons for this change in site-type, ruling out preservation factors alone as the reason for no older, large, shell deposits (Fladmark 1975a). I suggested that the shift to shell-midden sites probably represented a change towards a more sedentary settlement pattern, possibly paralleling that of the ethnographic winter village, as a result of an increase in salmon productivity associated with the coast-wide stabilization of sea levels about 5,000 B.P. I believe that this still stands as a reasonable hypothesis; however, more data are definitely needed if the question of the "origin" of shell-middens is ever going to be settled. Such data must include detailed information on the composition of early shell-midden layers, to determine if initial midden build-up began slowly or relatively suddenly, and whether there is any evidence of significant weathering and decomposition of shells with age. The presence of shell lenses in upper Late Lithic strata at Glenrose and</page><page sequence="26">120 British Columbia Prehistory Namu suggests that rates of shell-midden accumulation may have, in fact, increased gradually through time. Within the Developmental Stage one sees an overall cumulative accretion of cultural traits through time, culminating in the highly diverse assemblages of the Middle Substage. In most cases the artifact record suggests cultural continuity throughout the Developmental Stage for any given area and, at least in the Gulf of Georgia, some continuity back even into Old Cordilleran levels is also indicated by flaked stone assemblages. In general, the Gulf of Georgia artifact record would seem to indicate gradual in situ change and evolution, as do the Prince Rupert Harbour and Namu sequences. However, there are a number of material traits which appear in Middle and Late Developmental sites for which obvious local antecedents seem lacking. These include toggling harpoons, labrets, earspools, hard stone sculpture and possibly burial mounds in the Middle Developmental Substage, and earthwork fortifications and the weaving and tobacco complexes, apparently in the Late Developmental Substage. Most of these elements occur elsewhere in the New World as well as the Old, but a clear distributional continuity of, for instance, earspools and earthworks, between the Northwest Coast and other centers such as the Eastern Woodlands or Mesoamerica, is not yet known. Earspools are apparently relatively old in the Gulf of Georgia (ca. 2500-3500 B.P.), while other traits, such as tobacco pipes, appear confined to the latest prehistoric period; thus any mechanisms accounting for the diffusion of these presumably southern and eastern elements into the far Northwest must have been operative for a long time. Other difficulties are raised by the Locarno Beach Phase toggling harpoons, both single-piece and composite (Fig. 9e). Their nearest neighbours in space and time, if not in form, are in Norton, Okvik, and Old Bering Sea assemblages of the Bering Strait region, dated ca. 2500-2000 B.P. (Dumond 1977), with few if any intervening occurrences. Perhaps both toggling and barbed harpoons (it is worth noting that both probably "toggle" to some degree) were a non-preserved facet of early North Pacific Lithic cultures, retained or lost differentially through time, in various regions. Labrets are spottily distributed all over the world, including Africa and South America (Keddy 1981) and it seems impossible to account for all their occurrences by even the wildest diffusionist scheme. The Gulf of Georgia labrets are among the oldest in the North Pacific (ca. 3000-3500 B.P.) and might be an example of independent invention, although Keddy (1981) suggests that they signify the existence of a major trade network around the North Pacific rim at this time. Such traits as earspools and burial mounds, as well as the later weaving and tobacco complexes, may indicate that the Northwest Coast was not as completely isolated from centers of New World Formative cultures as is often stated (eg. Kroeber 1939; Willey and Phillips 1958). However, what form any long distance intra-continental connections may have taken, and precisely when, is not known. One possibility is the participation of Northwest Coast peoples in wide-flung North American exchange systems. It is clear that Developmental Stage coastal cultures were participating in trade networks extending at least well into the British Columbia Interior, as well as along the Coast, involving redistribution of dentalia and other shells, obsidian and other flakeable lithics, steatite, nephrite, native copper and, rarely, amber. If the ethnographic situation can be used for analogy, regional trade centres may have existed in conjunction with seasonal fisheries near the mouths of major rivers, including the Columbia, Fraser, Skeena, Nass and</page><page sequence="27">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 121 others. It may be entirely possible that the richness and diversity of ri vermouth sites such as Marpole is partly a function of their importance in trade (cf. Burley 1979, 1980). High ranking coastal chiefs and families may have controlled trade monopolies with the Interior and with other coastal groups, with redistribution of foodstuffs and other perishables at least as important as the archaeologically preserved elements. It is tempting to suggest that evolution of major trade networks during the Developmental Stage, analogous to those historically centered at the Nass and Dalles, had much to do with the final shape of the Northwest Coast cultural pattern and specific aspects of regional trait continuity and discontinuity. The nature of the transition between Middle and Late Developmental cultures is .also difficult to define. In the Gulf of Georgia region this boundary is also partly obscured by a short period of partial data inadequacy around 1,000-1,300 B.P., so that the full relationships between Marpole and Developed Coast Salish Phases is not entirely clear. However, this gap seems to be narrowing yearly, and the overall impression appears to be one of general continuity, with addition and subtraction of some traits on a basic core "theme" (eg. Burley 1980; Charlton 1980; Ham 1982; Mitchell 1971a). Borden earlier (1968a, 1970) proposed two phases (Whalen II, and "Pre-Stselax") which he inserted between Marpole and Developed Coast Salish. However, current researchers have generally rejected both concepts, preferring to emphasize a perceived continuity from Marpole into the final Coast Salish phase. Developed Coast Salish assemblages have been characterized as "spartan" and undramatic in comparison to those of the Marpole phase, which has sometimes been seen as a local culture-climax (eg. Burley 1980). This impression primarily depends upon lower artifact class diversity and the apparent scarcity of art objects and ornaments in the latest phase. However, as several researchers have pointed out, this may not be fair to the Developed Coast Salish culture, whose artistic products were primarily carved in wood or woven out of animal and vegetable fiber (Ham 1982; Kew 1980). It should be noted that steatite (soapstone) is probably the most easily carved natural material and can be effectively and rapidly worked with simple stone tools. All wood, including cedar, on the other hand, is a much more difficult and time consuming medium for finely detailed carving, particularly in the absence of metal tools. Indeed, the presence of some small quantities of drift iron and steel may have been critical to the evolution of at least the northern variant of Northwest Coast art over the last ca. 1-2,000 years. Mac Donald (1969) has described what he feels to be general cultural continuity throughout the Prince Rupert Harbour sequence, possibly representing 4,000-5,000 years of in situ Tsimshian cultural development. This position is at least in part a response to earlier opinions that the Tsimshian were relatively recent immigrants to the Coast from the Interior (eg. Boas 1902; Borden 1954b). There is apparent continuity in the Prince Rupert artifact record, with few dramatic content changes between the three "periods" as presently conceived (MacDonald and Inglis 1981). However, these are rather coarse cultural units as so far described, and there is little information yet available on the specific chronologies and stratigraphie relationships of individual artifact types. This may be crucial since, in at least one site - Gitaus - about 120 km upstream from the mouth of the Skeena River, Allaire (1978, 1979) reports what appear tobe alternating "Interior" and "Coastal" cultures, with an early Coastal related horizon replaced ca. 3,500-4,000 B.P. by a purely</page><page sequence="28">122 British Columbia Prehistory lithic assemblage possessing lanceolate points presumed to be of Interior origin (the Skeena Complex). This in turn later slowly becomes more "coastal" in content - i.e., adds more ground stone - through time. The Gitaus sequence thus suggests a significant cultural discontinuity about 3,500-4,000 B.P. and it would be of interest to scan carefully Prince Rupert Harbour assemblages of the same age for any similar effects. One reason why such scrutiny may be justified is the linguistic classification of the Tsimshian as members of the Penutian family, whose other nearest members are the Chinookan peoples at the mouth of the Columbia River. At some time prehistorically there must have been some kind of spatial continuity between Chinook and Tsimshian, implying that one or the other has moved to its present position, or that an intervening contiguous distribution of Penutian speakers has since disappeared. Either option has significant implications for the prehistory of the region and the Prince Rupert Harbour materials may still hold important information in this regard. Interior Prehistory Introduction The archaeology of the British Columbia Interior has received relatively short shrift in comparison to that of the Coast, and it is not an exaggeration to say that we still know very little about the prehistoric cultures of the intermontane region, particularly those prior to ca. 3-4,000 B.P. Initial archaeological explorations have now occurred in most subregions of the Interior, but little effort has been specifically directed at furthering understanding of such basic problems as culture history, prehistoric cultural ecology, or time-controlled settlement-subsistence studies. Most research has been concentrated in the Southern Interior (Figure 3), particularly along the middle Fraser River in the vicinity of the town of Lillooet, and along the Thompson River system (Figure 1), the Fraser' s main eastern tributary (eg. Archer 1971; Blake 1976; Brown and Lundborg 1977; C. Carlson 1980; Cybulski et al. 1981; Eldridge 1974; Hall 1969; Ham 1975; Johnson-Fladmark 1973; Mohs 1980, 1981; Pokotylo 1977, 1978; Richards 1978; Sänger 1966, 1967, 1968a and b, 1969, 1970a and b; Sendey 1971; Stewart 1972; Stryd 1971a and b, 1972a and b, 1973, 1974, 1978, 1980; Whitlam 1980; R. Wilson 1980; Wyatt 1972). This work has resulted in a partial sequence of occupation spanning 8,000 years, but with significant chronologically controlled data over only about the last 3-4,000 years. The Okanogan, Arrow Lakes and Kootenay regions of the upper Columbia River drainage have seen less intensive research. In this area there has been some emphasis on searching for Plains and Columbia Plateau relationships but, while there is apparent time depth exceeding 8,000 years, few well defined and well dated assemblages have yet been described, (eg. Bussey 1977, 1981; Choquette 1974, 1981, 1982; Copp 1979; French 1979; Grabert 1971, 1974; Loveseth, Reeves and Smith 1979; McKenzie 1976; Mohs 1978; Turnbull 1977; Whitlam 1974; I. Wilson 1980). Archaeological investigations in the Central Interior include surveys and excavations in the Chilcotin, Williams Lake, Blackwater and Nechako areas (eg. Apland 1979; Blacklaws 1979b; Borden 1952; Brandon and Irvine 1979; Burley 1975; Donahue 1973, 1975, 1977; Eldridge and Eldrige 1980; Fladmark 1976; Helmer 1977a and b; Kenney 1973; Lawhead 1980; Matson et. al. 1980; Mitchell 1970; Mohs 1972; Mohs and Mohs 1976; Montgomery 1978, 1979; Wilmeth 1975, 1978, 1980). As yet there are no dated cultural materials from the Central Interior older than about 4,500 B.P., although</page><page sequence="29">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 123 several undated assemblages suggest that this illogical situation will not persist much longer. Most of the Northern Interior is still relatively inaccessible and archaeologically is the least known area of the province, although it has seen increasing attention in the last few years. Survey and excavations in the Peace River district, east of the Rocky Mountains, have produced a scattering of radiocarbon dated materials back to ca. 5,500 B.P., and surface finds suggestive of ' 'classic" continental Paleoindian complexes (Fladmark 1975b, 1981b; Spurling 1980; Valentine, Fladmark and Spurling 1980). Elsewhere, survey and test excavations in the northern Rockies and along the Liard, Stikine and Taku drainages have yielded dates back to the 4-5,000 B.P. range, but complete sequences are not yet available (eg. Ball 1980; Eldridge personal communication 1982; Fladmark 1982; French 1977, 1980; Loy 1977; MacNeish 1960; Magne 1982; May 1977; Smith 1970, 1971, 1974). A pervasive and serious problem in the archaeology of the Southern and Central Interior has been the choice of sites selected for intensive excavation. I would venture that about 90% or more of all significant excavations in this area have been in pit-house sites, or sites possessing other kinds of aboriginally excavated features. Unfortunately, such sites are clearly the worst possible contexts from which to try to extract high confidence unmixed assemblages. When, as frequently occurred, cultural depressions were repeatedly re-used over 2-3,000 years, the resulting archaeological deposit may present an interpretive challenge exceeding the capabilities of even the most experienced researcher. Von Krogh (1980) and Wilmeth (1977) discuss some of the causes of cultural deposits of mixed age and interpretive difficulty in excavations of Plateau-type pit-houses. These are summarized below with some additions of my own: 1 . Excavation of housepits into prehousepit cultural horizons. 2. Deposition of fill from pit excavation, containing older materials, on house roof. 3 . Mixing of housepit and prehousepit materials by trampling in house floor. 4. Use of roof as tool manufacture and maintenance area. 5 . Use of roof as dump-site for hearth contents (possibly also with mixed older items) . 6. House abandonment and: (a) slumping of roof materials into pit; (b) slow size-sorted filtering of materials through roof back onto floor; and/or (c) slow collapse of roof accompanied by natural aeolian or fluvial deposition; (d) burning of structure and collapse of charred roof and contents into pit. 7. Slumping of pit walls, and older cultural materials, onto house floor, at any time before, during or after 2-6 above. 8. Reoccupation, and partial or complete re-excavation of housepit, and repeat of entire cycle. Potentially this could recur many times in the life of a single housepit, since they were often preferred sites for reoccupation because they required less excavation. 9. Final abandonment and partial in-filling of depression. This could also include later intermittent non -pit-house reoccupations, and deliberate filling with cultural garbage, all coupled with natural sedimentary and perturbatory processes. The end result of some or all of these factors, alone or in combination, as seen in an excavation profile, might visually appear to present a " simple and logical" sequence of cultural strata - including presumed in-situ ' 'hearths" and ' 'floors" - even though the artifact content of any given stratum may be highly mixed and displaced. Even if the greatest care is taken in stratigraphie control during excavation the probability of extracting much reliable cultural chronological data from such sites is low, since even exact</page><page sequence="30">124 British Columbia Prehistory Figure 8: Culture Sequences of the Southern Interior. stratigraphie association of two or more times will not prove their original cultural contemporanity. I am convinced that a major reason why Southern and Central Interior cultural sequences are so peculiarly lacking in inter-areal agreement, tight chronological control, and consistent typological associations is because most have been recovered from pit-house sites. In addition, concentration on only pit-house sites probably ensures that no cultural materials will be found dating much older than ca. 4,000 years (the known maximum age of such features in British Columbia), unless the aboriginal pit-house excavation fortuitously intersected, but did not also totally destroy, earlier cultural horizons. Finally, since pit-houses are generally ethnographically reported to have been winter habitations, Kennedy and Bouchard (1978) to the contrary, it is likely that pit-house excavations will provide information strongly skewed towards only a single aspect of the original people's annual seasonal round. A further complicating factor in Interior archaeology is the fact that this region is more significantly environmentally diverse than the Coast. Some streams possess Pacific salmon, others do not (eg. parts of the Upper Columbia system); some areas are open xerophytic</page><page sequence="31">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 125 grasslands, others are boreal forest (or alpine tundra, or subalpine forest, etc.); some areas had caribou (or wapiti, or moose), while others did not. One would expect in such a situation considerable cultural diversity, particularly in terms of subsistence technology and settlement patterns. A mosaic of related variant cultures separated by mountain ranges or drainage divides may be the only "typical" long-standing regional pattern. Thus strong intra-regional cultural correlation and integration may continue to be a very difficult task in the Interior, even in non-pithouse contexts. For purposes of convenience alone, description of Interior prehistoric cultures will be organized according to a "traditional" trifold system of (1) Early Period &gt; 8,000 B.P.; (2) Middle Period - 8,000-3,000/3,500 B.P. and; (3) Late Period - 3,000/3,500 to contact. Some previously published cultural-historical sequences are illustrated in Figure 8, as well as a tentative partial re-ordering summarizing the discussions in the following pages. The Early Period: &gt; 8,000 B.P. There are very few cultural manifestations known in the British Columbia Interior which might be older than 8,000 years B.P., and only one has been reliably dated and reported. This is the Gore Creek "burial," near Kamloops in the South Thompson River Valley. Consisting of the post-cranial skeleton of a young adult male found exposed in an eroding gully beneath several meters of redeposited silt and Mt. Mazama and St. Helen's "Y" volcanic tephra layers, the individual was apparently a victim of a flash-flood or mudflow during a period of renewed Holocene sedimentation (Cybulski et al. 1981). The skeleton is collagen dated at 8,250 B.P. Unfortunately no artifacts were associated, but a C13 analysis of the bone suggests that the person's diet was primarily terrestrial in origin, and not salmon (Nelson personal communication 1981). Other cultural finds have been made beneath ash thought to be from the Mt. Mazama eruption in the Crowsnest Pass area of extreme southeastern B.C. (Loveseth, Reeves and Smith 1979), including apparently "Mummy Cave Complex" materials, but as yet there have been no artifact descriptions or radiocarbon dates reported. Smith's (1971, 1974) and Smith and Harrison's (1978) assignment of a 9,000 B.P. + date to the "Ice Mountain Microblade Industry" and presumed pre-Ice Mountain Industry finds in the Stikine River area was based solely on obsidian hydration, a clearly unreliable absolute dating technique, particularly for single sample estimates. The mean of all Smith's hydration dates on the Ice Mountain Microblade Industry is about 4,500 B.P. which is possibly a fair estimate of its actual age (Fladmark 1982). The four flakes reported by Smith and Harrison (1978) to be pre-Ice Mountain Microblade Industry are therefore neither necessarily old, nor indicative of any significantly distinct cultural complex. Other finds which may predate ca. 8,000 B.P. include scattered surface occurrences of possible Paleoindian projectile points. The largest cluster of such finds occurs in the Peace River district, which, lying east of the Rocky Mountains, is physiographically part of the Plains, and may be expected to possess closer cultural ties with central North America. At least three separate sites have yielded surface finds of lanceolate concave-based fluted or basally-thinned projectiles which fall within the range of formal variation attributed to Clovis and its eastern variants (Fladmark 1981b; Spurling 1980). These points were found on plateau surfaces above the present Peace River valley. Their maximum age thus depends</page><page sequence="32">126 British Columbia Prehistory upon the dating of recessional stages of glacial Lake Peace, but there is no known geological reason why they could not be at least 10,000 years old. Elsewhere in the Peace River area have been found Cody Complex points (Fladmark 1981b) as well as other generalized short concave-based "Plainview-like" points. West of the Rocky Mountain divide, Choquette (1981, 1982) reports possible Late Paleoindian point finds from mountainous regions of the East Kootenays, while Turnbull (1977) illustrates a single possible fluted point from the Kootenay River valley near Nelson. The only possible fluted point from the Fraser Plateau known to me is a wide, thin, deeply concave, basal fragment from the South Thompson River area, possessing several broad-shallow basal thinning flake scars on each face (Figure llm). Unfortunately, it is too fragmentary to be confident of an early typological ascription. Scottsbluff-like points and other Cody Complex-like materials occur infrequently in private collections throughout Southern and Central Interior British Columbia, particularly in eastern areas (eg. Duff and Borden 1954). However, no particularly convincing Paleoindian point has yet been found in an excavated, dated context, although occasional small, apparently re- worked Scottsbluff-like (incipiently stemmed) points do show up in assemblages dated within the last ca. 4,000-3,500 years (eg. Stewart 1972). The relationship of Paleoindian-like projectiles to other Middle or Late Period complexes is unknown, although Sanger (1970a) suggests that Early Nesikep Tradition points have their roots in Plains Paleoindian complexes. However, similar styles of projectile points also occur with Windust Phase sites of the Columbia-Snake River area (Rice 1972), and it seems possible that Windust ' 'peoples" could have been among the first to penetrate into the Southern Interior of British Columbia. Bison may have been an element of some early Southern Plateau faunal assemblages, perhaps providing an impetus for Plains or Columbia Plateau peoples to enter the area. Nevertheless, such speculation aside, until there is actual excavation of reliable stratigraphie contexts, in settings permitting considerable age such as rock-shelters in upland areas, the Early Period in Interior British Columbia will remain obscure. The Middle Period: 8,000-3,000/3,500 B. P. The basic and longest-standing cultural-chronological sequence for the Southern Interior is that developed by Sänger for the Lochnore-Nesikep locality of the middle Fraser (1963, 1966a, b, 1967, 1968a, b, c, 1969, 1970a, b). Sänger separated his ca. 9,000 year long sequence into an early Lochnore Complex (ca. 7,000-9,000 B.P. +) and a Nesikep Tradition, spanning the last 7,000 years, but subdivided into Early (7,000-5,500 B.P.), Lower Middle (5,500-3,500 B.P.), Upper Middle (3,500-2,000 B.P.) and Late (2,000 B.P. -contact) segments. The last ca. 800 years of the Nesikep Tradition is defined as the Kamloops Phase, based mainly on the presence of small "Kamloops Type" side-notched points. Sänger' s Lochnore-Nesikep locality possessed 7 major sites, with at least 20 separate components. Most of the sites included pit-houses, and chronological ordering of the excavated components was not a simple task, particularly since Sanger (1970a) found it necessary to reject or view as suspect almost half of his radiocarbon dates, several of which yielded widely varying estimates on the same sample. Sanger (1970a) based his chronological ordering of components on stratigraphie position, estimates of the</page><page sequence="33">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 127 significance of marked formal differences in spatially close assemblages, geological context, degree of carbonate patination, typology, and radiocarbon dates. However, he apparently only accepted the latter if they matched age assessments obtained by the other criteria. This procedure raises many uncertainties, but probably seemed to be the best methodology available during the analysis of what were the first significant "modern" archaeological excavations in the Southern Interior. As Sanger (1970a: 103) notes: Future workers in the area may find that the dates considered less reliable at this time are in fact more accurate . Most workers in the Southern Interior following Sänger have depended on his sequence as the principal chronological yardstick against which to measure their finds. However, there is increasing feeling today that some of Sänger' s sequence - representing as it did an initial provisional "best-fit" estimate, made without the aid of extensive comparative chronological cross-references - should be treated with considerable caution (eg. Lawhead 1979; Richards 1978; Pokotylo, personal communication 1982). Unfortunately however, there have not yet been any new dated components located and studied as early as Sänger' s (1970a) Lehman Zone II (6650 ± 100 B. P.) and Nesikep Zone VII (5,625 ± 190 B. P.). So, while dissatisfaction continues with some of the original component assignments, and age estimates for components lacking C14 dates, there are no cultural formulations with which to replace or compare them. Although little substantive revision is yet possible with Sänger' s Early Nesikep concept, his Lochnore Complex seems today to be on increasingly thin ice. It consisted of a collection of materials shallowly underlying a house pit floor at the Lochnore site, as well as some artifacts hand-sorted from the later house pit assemblage on the basis of carbonate and sand surface coatings, which were taken as indications of greater age. The house pit floor was dated at 2,670 ± 130 and 3,280 ± 125 B.P. on the same sample; however Sänger (1970a) thought the underlying (undated) Zone III containing the Lochnore Complex to be considerably older. Sänger (1969) considered the Lochnore Complex to be an Interior manifestation of the Old Cordilleran culture, with leaf-shaped points, flake tools, and an absence of microblades, typologically comparable to the Milliken and Mazama Phases of the Fraser Canyon. However, recent excavations at two dated Interior sites, and at least one other undated site, suggest that a complex or complexes possessing leaf-shaped (and other) points, other tool forms including heavy flake cores, and an absence of microblades, existed in the Southern and possibly Central Interior ca. 3,500-4,00 years ago. These include the Terrace Site at Lillooet, dated 4,145 ± 205 B.P. (Richards 1978) and the Moulton Creek Site, on the South Thompson River (Eldridge 1974), where an "Old Cordilleran-like" assemblage lacking microblades directly underlies Mt. St. Helen's "Y" tephra, and should therefore be about 4,000 years old. Undated pit house excavations at the Deep Creek Site, near Williams Lake, yielding leaf-shaped and stemmed points (Kenny 1973) may also belong to this relatively late possibly "Old Cordilleran-like" complex, as probably also does much of Grabert's (1974) Indian Dan Phase in the Okanogan Valley, dated about 6,000-3,000 B.P. (Stryd 1973). It is also worth noting that large leaf-shaped points occur near the bottom of the cultural deposits in the ca. 4,000 year old Houseplatform 1 excavations at Punchaw Lake (Fladmark 1976), and are also associated with the apparently intrusive Skeena Complex at Gitaus on the Lower Skeena dated 4,000-3,500 B.P. (Allaire 1979). Thus there seems to be little reason to assign an assemblage from the Interior of</page><page sequence="34">128 British Columbia Prehistory British Columbia an early age simply because of the presence of leaf-shaped projectiles. Whether one wishes to use the term "Old Cordilleran" (or "Cascade" etc.), when referring to 3,000-4,000 year old leaf-point complexes, will have to depend on detailed comparisons of all other aspects of the assemblages, and some knowledge, not yet obtained, of the degree of actual technological continuity with genuinely early components. However, it is possible that there is a late leaf-shaped point horizon throughout the Southern and Central Interior, which is roughly comparable to late Cascade Phase manifestations of the Columbia Plateau (eg. Ames et. al. 1980; Bense 1972; Leonhardy and Rice 1970), even though "classic" Cascade points may be rare. Another aspect of the Middle Period important to Sänger' s definition of his Early and Middle Neskikep Tradition is the Plateau Microblade Tradition (Sanger 1968a). However, there is now increasing uncertainty about both initial and terminal dates of the microblade tradition in the British Columbia Interior (Lawhead 1979; Stryd 1973). The oldest dated microblade occurrence in the Interior is a single microblade found beneath about 20 m of earth-flow deposits and Mt. Mazama ash at the Dry nock Slide site east of Lytton on the Thompson River. A thin cultural deposit exposed in an artificial cut through the slide is radiocarbon dated to 7,530 ± 230 B.P. (Sänger 1968a). Most of Sänger' s other microblades came from Zone II of the Lehman site, making up 50 percent of that assemblage, radiocarbon dated at 6,650 ± 100 B.P. (although Sanger 1970a considered that date possibly too early), while only 3 percent of the Nesikep Zone VII assemblage, dated 5,625 ± 190 B.P. consisted of microblades. Thus, microblades are not known to be present in quantity in the southern Plateau before ca. 6,600 B.P., since the one possible blade from the Drynock site is not, by itself, convincing evidence of significant earlier occurrences. The prior occurrence of microblades on the Northern and Central Northwest Coast suggests that this technology may have originally penetrated the southern British Columbia Interior from the west, rather than southwards from the Yukon. The diminished proportion of microblades at Nesikep Zone VII may indicate that they were already waning as an important element of Plateau tool kits as early as ca. 5,600 B.P. , while their total absence at the Terrace and Moulton Creek Sites (Eldridge 1974; Richards 1978) suggests that their demise was complete before ca. 4,000 B.P. Scattered later microblade occurrences at Sanger's Lochnore-Nesikep locality may be a result of disturbed house pit deposits. A terminal date for Plateau microblades of about 4,000-5,000 B.P. would be in accordance with the upper limit of most early North Pacific microblade sites (eg. Ackerman 1974; R. Carlson 1979; Clark 1979; Fladmark 1979b); the end of the microblade-blade bearing Little Arm Phase of the southwest Yukon (Workman 1978); and recent evidence for the terminal date of the Ice Mountain Microblade Industry in extreme northwestern Interior British Columbia (Fladmark 1982). In the Central Interior there are no true microblades in the large 4,000 year long assemblage from Punchaw Lake, Fladmark (1976) and Helmer (1977b) to the contrary, although good microblade collections are known for that general region (eg. Brandon and Irvine 1979). Donahue (1975) argues against the presence of a significant microblade industry throughout the ca. 4-4,500 year sequence at Tezli, and the ca. 3,500 year long Deer Park sequence in the Arrow Lakes also lacks any significant numbers of microblades, although the industry is known in that southeastern area as well (Mohs 1978; Turnbull 1977). There are no microblades in the ca. 4,000 year long sequences at Hagwilget and Gitaus on the Skeena River, and their only</page><page sequence="35">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 129 definite occurrence in the Peace River District is not yet clearly dated (Spurling 1980). In 1973, Stryd felt that microblades ceased about 3,000 B.P. in the Lillooet area, but even then cautioned that "the absence of microblades (at Moulton Creek) may ultimately precipitate a new hard look at the terminal date for the Plateau Microblade tradition" (Stryd 1973:28). The data listed above seem to indicate a ca. 4,000 B.P. termination for microblades throughout most of Interior British Columbia, but there are still a few exceptions. A substantial collection of microblades from Marron Lake in the southern Okanogan Valley (Grabert 1974) is associated with a date of 2,500 B.P. However the limited extent of these excavations, and the presence of at least one pit-house, may suggest the possibility of unrecognized mixing which would have been revealed in a larger exposure. Another rather late apparent persistence of microblades is the Central Interior Natalkuz Lake pit house assemblage dated about 2,450 B.P. (Borden 1952). Just to the south, Wilmeth's series of late prehistoric/early historic Chilcotin house pit excavations near Anahim Lake resulted in one of the largest and most anomalously recent series of radiocarbon dated microblade assemblages (Wilmeth 1978). Seven separate house pit excavations yielded microblades dated between 120 ± 130 B.P. and 1,870 ± 75 B.P. Wilmeth (1978) discounted most as a result of a mixture of earlier materials with recent house floors, but was willing to accept microblade dates as late as 1,600-2,000 B.P. One must probably agree that the Anahim Lake assemblages are hopelessly entangled in the problems of pit house archaeology described earlier, although the number of repeated occurrences in this locality is difficult to discount entirely (Helmer 1977b; Wilmeth 1980). It is worth noting that another cluster of anomalously recent terminal ages for microblades (as late as ca. 1,000 B.P.) occurs in east-central Alaska (eg. Clark 1975; Dumond 1977; Holmes 1977; Shinkwin 1979). Perhaps microblades delayed their demise in a few (particularly isolated?) Interior regions, well past their general extinction date of ca. 4,000 B.P. , for some undetermined reason. Little is known about other cultural associations with Plateau microblades, or the exact manner of their use. The occurrence of microblade assemblages in alpine and upland settings in the Edziza Range and Hat Creek Valley demonstrates that they were definitely not always used for fish-knives (Fladmark 1982; Ludowicz 1982), and were probably multi-function tools for a variety of cutting tasks. Types of projectile points positively associated with microblades in the Interior are also not clear, although they probably included some large corner-notched and possibly lanceolate variants (Sänger 1969, 1970a). However, it seems possible that most medium-sized corner notched, side-notched and stemmed points occur in housepit contexts post-dating any true blade industry. However, the ethnographic Thompson were reported to use a considerable range of different types and sizes of arrowpoints for different functions (Teit 1900), and we thus need not always necessarily expect neat correlations of Plateau point types with discrete blocks of time. The Late Period: 3,000/3,500 to the present The Late Period, at least in the Southern Interior, is marked by a general absence or rarity of microblades, the widespread appearance of pit houses, and the first arrow-type (i.e., narrow necked) projectile points. It is also marked in its more recent portions by adzes and other ground stone; decorated objects, particularly in burial inclusions (Sanger 1966b, 1968c); and apparently increased diversity in specialized flaked stone bifaces and unifaces,</page><page sequence="36">130 British Columbia Prehistory as well as bone and antler tools. Stryd (1973) and R. Wilson (1980) divide the Late Nesikep Tradition into several sequent phases, including the late Kamloops Phase originally defined by Sanger (1969). Stryd' s (1973) earliest subdivision of the Late Nesikep Tradition is the Nicola Phase (ca. 2,800-1,800 B.P.) characterizied by relatively small round to oval pit houses; use of atlatls and the absence of the bow and arrow; large to medium barbed corner-notched points, and possible spall tools. The later Lillooet Phase (1,800-1,200 B.P.) is marked by "Lillooet Corner-Notched" arrow points, bilaterally barbed antler points, deer scapula scrapers, and possibly steatite pipes. Overlapping elements with the final Kamloops Phase include dentalium beads, ground slate knives (rare), pentagonal bifaces, "crescent scrapers," mat creasers, rib needles, small barbed and corner-notched arrow-points; cairn burials (?) and steatite disc beads (?). The Kamloops Phase dates between ca. 1,200 B.P. and European contact, although the initial date of the diagnostic Kamloops side-notched arrow point is not completely clear. Distinctive traits include Kamloops side-notched arrow points (Figure llb-d); a steatite and antler carving complex, zoomorphic hand-mauls, pectén shells, tubular steatite pipes, bird-bone beads, chipped and drilled slate pendants, a possible weaving complex, small asymmetric leaf- shaped points, notched chipped stone drills, spall tools, chipped stone spokeshaves, metapodial awls, mica-flakes and large pit houses. R. Wilson's (1980) Thompson Phase overlaps in time and character with Stryd's (1973) Lillooet and Nicola Phases, but has so far only been applied to the South Thompson River region (eg. C. Carlson 1980). Interior Prehistory: Discussion The oldest dated pit houses in the Interior of British Columbia are at Tezli and Punchaw Lake (Donahue 1975; Fladmark 1976) where occupations apparently begin at about 4,000 B.P. A house at Deer Park in the Arrow Lakes region is dated about 3,500 B.P. (Turnbull 1977), while most excavated houses in the Fraser Plateau date about 500-1,000 B.P. (Figure 5). These are mainly circular housepits of the type best described by Teit (1900), but oval, square and rectangular house pits also occur relatively frequently (eg. Mohs 1980). Possible temporal differences in the size and shape of housepits has been a topic of research interest for some time (eg. Grabert 1971; Nelson 1969; Mohs 1980; Stryd 1971b), but without much in the way of definite conclusions, although shallow square housepits may generally be late (eg. Mohs 1980). It is worth reiterating that the oldest house pit in all of British Columbia including the coast is the rectangular Maurer house on the Lower Fraser River, dated 4,000-5,000 B.P. Although people have speculated that pit houses came into the Fraser Plateau from the north (eg. Stryd 1973), there is no continuity of distribution or style between British Columbia and Alaskan pit houses, and no definite reported examples in British Columbia north of about 55°N. Pit houses occur earlier in northern California and the Columbia Plateau, where they date 5,500-4,500 B.P., than they do in the Arctic and Subarctic (Ames and Marshall 1980; Dumond 1977). Thus it seems likely that the idea of pit-houses spread into the British Columbia Interior from the south or west, rather than the north. This implies that they were not adopted principally as well-insulated winter dwellings suited to cooler Neoglacial conditions, but may instead be broadly associated with a trend towards increasing sedentism and cultural complexity throughout the Northwest in the last 5,000-4,000 years (eg. Ames and Marshall 1980; Grabert 1971; Stryd 1971b). Pit-houses apparently penetrate the British Columbia Interior nearly synchronously with the final demise of the microblade industry. This again may be linked with significantly changing settlement and subsistence patterns at this time. Not long after the first</page><page sequence="37">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 131 introduction of pit-houses came the bow-and-arrow, but for a period of time there were probably neither microblades nor small arrow-points in the Interior. Thus the latter cannot be seen as in some way functionally replacing the former. It is possible, however, that bi-polar core technologies, producing small microblade-like spalls, may have operated for a time as functional replacements for the earlier prepared core industry. Certainly a bi-polar industry seems widespread throughout the Interior and South Coast in the last ca. 4,000 years. There is much about the Late Nesikep Tradition of the Southern Interior that is reminiscent of the Middle Developmental Substage of the Coast. This includes elaboration and diversification of tool assemblages, sophisticated art, possible indication of status differentiation in burials and associated ' 'wealth" objects, and indication of interaction in wide ranging trade networks, for instance, occasional pieces of turquoise found in late period sites of the southern Okanogan Valley (Caldwell 1954) hint at long distance ties to the south. The Interior Late Period sees the development of major pit house villages, in some cases with 100 + large house pits, sometimes in cohesive seemingly organized groupings. A plotting of published 14C dates suggests that there was a marked peak of cultural deposition about 1,000-1,500 B.P. (Figure 5) in the Interior, perhaps indicating some kind of climax in the number and size of pit-house settlements at this time. Although the Plateau is clearly the recipient of cultural inputs from surrounding regions at various times, it is also true, though less well-known, that the region possesses a number of distinctive material traits which provide a distinctive cast to local archaeological assemblages and which are not commonly found on adjacent Coast or Plains. These include flaked stone pendants (Figure Ilk), eccentrics, geometric forms, "concave-side scrapers" (Figure 111) and a variety of well made drills and other specialized flaked stone tools. Ground and polished nephrite knives and fine chisels (Figure Hi) as well as presumably non-functional adze blades of exaggerated length, demonstrate a technical excellence in the abrasive alteration of hard stone at least equal to that of the Coast. Prehistoric Interior peoples were also capable of fine achievements in bone, antler, and steatite carving, including distinctive trumpet- shaped tobacco-pipes. The finest portable art from the Southern Interior is technically comparable to any from the South Coast and, indeed, much of the steatite sculpture found in Gulf of Georgia Middle Developmental sites may have been manufactured in the Interior, as suggested by motifs such as rattlesnakes on carved bowls from Vancouver Island and the Fraser Delta (Duff 1956). Known sources of steatite and nephrite in southern British Columbia generally occur along the axis of the Fraser River between about Hope (Figure 1:7) and Lillooet. It is likely that this "middle" Fraser region was the source of the southern nephrite and steatite industries, from which perhaps mainly finished products dispersed outwards. It is interesting that this region also coincides with the major salmon fisheries of the Fraser Canyon where, historically, south Coast and Interior cultures were in closest contact. Possibly steatite and nephrite products functioned partly as symbols of wealth and media of exchange, paralleling and complementing the food surpluses available in the area. British Columbia Prehistory: General Summary The tempo of archaeological research and analysis has increased sharply in British Columbia over the last ca. 15 years. However, the result is still more an increased ability to ask sensible questions of the data than to provide confident answers. Many fundamental problems of prehistoric cultural relationships in space and time are still only dimly perceived, while even appropriate approaches to more complex "processual" problems are</page><page sequence="38">132 British Columbia Prehistory generally elusive. However, at least a few major issues can be highlighted as matters of current and hopefully future inquiry. One major contemporary issue is the attempt to understand the prehistoric evolution of the complex aspects (ranked societies, wealth redistribution, dense populations, elaborate art and architecture) which characterized the ethnographic culture of the Northwest Coast (eg. Ames 1981, Burley 1979, Fladmark 1975a, Schalk 1977). Implicit in this search is the assumption that such aspects have not always existed among coastal cultures and, somehow, for some reason(s), developed through time. It is worth reiterating, however, that all or most of the fundamental technological and economic basis of Northwest Coast culture may always have been present, from the very first occupation of the region.

From Lillooet, British Columbia. 25 cm high, redrawn from Duff, 1956, Plate I. would most likely have been the case if the initial inhabitants infiltrated the region from other coastal areas of the North Pacific - an hypothesis more supportable at the moment than any notion that the bulk of early coastal peoples penetrated out to the Pacific from various Interior homelands. If coastal peoples have always been maritime adapted it becomes difficult to interpret later social elaboration as simply the result of fundamental evolution in subsistence related technologies or strategies (eg. Burley 1979; Schalk 1977). However, such social elaboration might result from some significant changes in the natural environment, affecting the quality and/or quantity of resources effectively obtained by an essentially unchanging resource exploitation strategy. For this reason I have contended that the apparent synchroneity of initial archaeological indications of cultural complexity (the Early Developmental Substage) with initial stabilization of relative sea levels is significant. Whether this association is linked through an intermediary mechanism of optimization of salmon productivity (eg. Fladmark 1975a) can still not be either proved or disproved, although convincing alternative explanations are still lacking. Critical to the question of the evolution of coastal cultural complexity is the nature and cause of the transition between Late Lithic and Early Developmental cultures, including whether it is gradual or abrupt; regionally synchronous or time transgressive; and linked or not linked to changes in resource species availability and use. Unfortunately the data do not yet provide strong answers. Whatever the cause of the transition, the period after ca. 5,000 B.P. saw everywhere increased site sizes and frequencies, increased artifact diversity, and the appearance and increased elaboration of art and decoration, so that by the Middle Developmental period most of the general characteristics of the ethnographic Northwest Coast cultural pattern were clearly present, complete with minor inter-regional differences which may reflect cultural subdivisions similar to those of the ethnographic period. However, this is not to say that there was little or no cultural change in the last</page><page sequence="40">134 British Columbia Prehistory Figure 11.

As indicated earlier there were important developments in this period, especially visible in the Gulf of Georgia area. Whether such changes were paralleled in all other parts of the coast is not clear, although initial suggestions seem negative. In the Gulf of Georgia there is a suggestion of decreased elaboration and lowered cultural-product diversity in the Late Developmental substage, relative to what went before. As noted earlier this impression must be dealt with carefully since, for instance, a shift between steatite and</page><page sequence="41">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 135 wood as sculptural media would account for an archaeologically apparent reduction in art objects, even though the actual quantity and quality of sculpture in general might not have diminished. Nevertheless, the people around the mouth of the Fraser River in particular, appear to have had a reduced and simpler material cultural inventory during the last 1,000- 1,500 years. It is perhaps significant that a reduction in South Coastal cultural ' 'elaboration" during the Late Developmental substage appears to correlate with an increase in Interior cultural complexity at about the same time. Is it possible that the cultural ' 'center of gravity" shifted up the Fraser River from its mouth to about the Lytton-Lillooet area by about 1,500 B.P.? Increasing Interior influences appear to occur in South Coast cultural sequences during the last ca. 1,000-2,500 years, with the downriver (?) spread of Interior- style pit-houses, steatite pipes, and small side-notched arrow points. Although it might be possible to explain the appearance of Interior traits on the Coast by prehistoric migrations coastward (eg. Borden 1954a, b), any such hypothesis must also account for an apparently heightened cultural complexity in the Interior at the same time. Rather than imagining Coast Salish migrating inland on one side of the Fraser River, as Interior Salish move coastward on the other, waving cheerfully to each other as they pass, it makes more sense to see these changes as the result of large scale systemic developments which simultaneously affected both Interior and Coastal cultures. The exact nature of these developments can only be guessed at the moment, but may have had something to do with one or all of the following: 1. Evolution of regional and extra-regional trade networks, probably focussed on major river fisheries - i.e. centers of population aggregation and resource redistribution. Changes through time in the availability, exploitation and redistribution of any of the main Fraser River products might have been involved, including salmon, eulachon, nephrite and steatite, with the upriver (Lytton-Lillooet) area possibly gaining prominence over the Delta in the latest period. 2. Sedimentary or hydrological changes in the Fraser River, causing a shift upstream in the location of prime salmon exploitation areas through time. Such a shift might, hypothetically, have occurred during the Neoglacial, with changes in meltwater run-off and patterns of stream and delta aggradation and erosion. 3. General Neoglacial climatic effects which may have improved or altered the inhabitability of the hot, dry lower valleys of the southern Interior. 4. Extra-areal cultural influences, or, alternatively, some autochthonous factors, leading to increased sedentism in Interior settlement patterns, including changes in animal or plant resource availability or use (eg. Ames and Marshall 1980). Most archaeologists in British Columbia have not yet paid serious attention to the possible cultural-ecological significance of environmental changes occurring in the transition between Hypsithermal and Neoglacial periods in the last 3,000-4,000 years. Coastal peoples, except for those directly impacted by advancing ice, such as some of the Tlingit groups of Southeastern Alaska (eg. de Laguna et al. 1964), were probably buffered from major climatic effects of the Neoglacial by maritime influences. However, some Interior peoples might have been significantly affected. Major factors, all of which are documented to some extent, could have included changes in sedimentation patterns, both fluvial and aeolian; changes in stream run-off characteristics and sediment load (perhaps affecting spawning fish and their exploitation); lowering of altitudinal vegetational zones;</page><page sequence="42">136 British Columbia Prehistory increased snow and ice cover in alpine areas; and associated changes in terrestrial faunal distributions. These might have had strong influences on how people prehistorically used their environment, one of the most obvious being possibly diminished use of high elevation resources (both faunal and lithic), in comparison to that of the Hypsithermal (eg. Fladmark 1982). Important biogeographic changes which seem to have occurred during the Neoglacial include establishment of climax cedar forests along the Coast (Hebda and Mathewes 1982) and a late spread of moose throughout the Northern and Central Interior, with a possible concomittant decline in woodland caribou (eg. Kew 1973). Either of these could conceivably have strongly affected the appearance of interacting Native cultures. Ethnographic differences between Coastal and Interior patterns have long provided archaeologists with something like antipodal models of human adaptation to the Pacific Northwest, to be used as rough analogues for prehistoric stages of culture. Thus some archaeologists have argued for an initial relatively generalized hunting and gathering stage (roughly analogous to ethnographic Interior cultures) which developed increased specializa- tion through time to coastal/riverine resources, until at some point it became recognizably "Northwest Coast" in appearance (eg. Borden 1962, 1975). This slow process was usually seen as accompanied by actual physical population movement out on to the Coast along the river valleys. Some researchers have also pointed to waves or episodes of "Interior" influences and/or people reaching the coast at various times in the past (eg. Borden 1954b; and perhaps Burley and Beattie 1977), while others have recognized alternating periods of "Coastal" and/or "Interior" influences in critical potential contact areas along the major rivers (eg. Allaire 1979). The use of an ethnographically generated concept of prehistoric cultural differences between Coast and Interior British Columbia, in which primacy and origin of certain traits is assigned on the basis of their historical distributions, is partly akin to the Alaska- Arctic paradigmatic dichotomy between prehistoric "Eskimo" and "In- dian", and may involve many similar problems. However, it is a deeply engrained approach in the area and one possessing at least descriptive utility. Nevertheless it is worth remembering that at some time(s) in the past: (1) there may have been no significant recognizable differences between Coastal and Interior cultures; (2) certain Interior areas may have possessed some "more complex" cultural traits, than did certain contemporary Coastal areas; (3) Interior cultures may have developed out of early generalized Coastal adaptations. Recognition and understanding of any of these hypothetical situations might be hampered by a too rigid assumption that certain prehistoric traits are a priori solely "Coastal" or "Interior" because of their ethnographic distribution, particularly when the archaeology of the Interior, at least, is still so very underdeveloped. Pacific salmon has often been cited as the critical environmental factor setting off the Northwest Coast and, to a lesser extent, the Interior Plateau from other hunter-gatherer areas. Rich harvests of salmon in summer and fall usually provided reliable, easily harvested food surpluses just before winter, which could then be used to sustain relatively dense population aggregates and energy-expensive cultural activities during the cold season when other northern hunter-gatherers were sometimes struggling just to maintain bare subsistence. Population densities seem to correlate directly with salmon availability throughout southern British Columbia (Kew 1976; Sneed 1971), and cultural response to and use of salmon surpluses has been the most frequent mechanism invoked in recent years to explain the evolution of complex aspects of the coastal cultural pattern (eg. Ames 1981;</page><page sequence="43">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY No. 6, 1982 137 Fladmark 1975a; Schalk 1977). There seems little doubt that an exact understanding of man-salmon interaction through time in the Pacific Northwest would be a very substantial step forward in tracing the development of British Columbia's aboriginal cultures, but adequate chronologically controlled data are still not yet available. Finally, it is worth noting that while there is a long tradition in Northwest Coast studies which denies the existence of any recognizable ties between the complex societies of the North Pacific and other centers of Formative and Classic cultures in the New World (eg. Kroeber 1939; Willey and Phillips 1958), the presence of a variety of traits (earspools, burial mounds, earthworks, tobacco etc.) suggests that some prehistoric contacts, albeit probably indirect and ephemeral, did exist. These contacts might have taken the form of multiple long-distance exchange sequences, perhaps following the Columbia and Missouri drainages. Such contact may have provided some interchange of ideas as well as materials. Indeed, a question which cannot be further explored here, but which may prove a subject of profitable future investigation, is the extent to which the general Northwest Coast prehistoric sequence, particularly the Lithic/Development Stage transition, may eventually be seen as culturally equivalent and temporally parallel to the general Archaic/Woodland sequence of eastern and central North America.
