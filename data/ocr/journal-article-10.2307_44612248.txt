Mackay The University of Birmingham ABSTRACT Lower limb injuries which might be assessed for current or proposed barrier tests were described for belted drivers in frontal impacts. Injury and impairment were rated using the Abbreviated Injury scale and the Injury Impairment scale. Both emphasised the importance of fracture, especially to the ankle /foot region. AIS &gt; 2 and IIS &gt; 1 injury rates were high with small driver side (right side) overlaps but a high rate was also found for wide overlap impacts with driver side load concentration. Passenger shell intrusion was frequently associated with injuries of AIS &gt; 2 and IIS &gt; 1. Injuries of this type occasionally occurred with low intrusion and at low impact speeds and will be important in view of the frequency of those types of crashes in the tow-away population. Femur and ankle/foot fractures were sustained predominantly by the right limb and it is recommended that further experimental work be carried out to determine the specific injury mechanisms involved with different intrusion levels at given impact speeds. INTRODUCTION For 30 years the protection of car occupants against life threatening injuries has been a top priority. The development and acceptance of new restraint technologies gives better protection to the vital areas of the head and chest in more severe crashes. Now the protection of those body regions not commonly associated with fatal injury risk increases in relative importance. Recent studies of front occupant injuries in frontal impact show that lower extremities come second only to the head in terms of frequency of AIS &gt; 2 injury (1, 2). In the United States the number of front seat occupants with AIS &gt; 3 lower limb injury has been estimated at 27,000 /year in tow away crashes (3) and that those AIS &gt; 3 injuries occur more frequently to the pelvis, thigh and leg rather than to the ankle, foot and knee (4). More important than the threat to life is that lower limb injuries can result in long healing and rehabilitation times (5) and can also lead to permanent disability and premature impairment of normal function (4, 6). Disability is a relative term and is not interchangeable with impairment. It depends on a variety of personal factors which are not easily quantified. Ultimately, impairment together with treatment costs, productivity losses and administrative costs must also be considered (7, 8, 9). Frontal impacts are the most common collision type and account for the highest proportion of serious injury. 850</page><page sequence="2">Fig 1: Femur Force Criterion from Mertz (12) As such, improved occupant protection in a frontal collision holds the greatest potential for injury reduction. Current European frontal crash legislation (10) specifies no requirements for the lower extremities, while in North America a limit is only placed on forces transmitted to the femur (11). One of the currently proposed tests in Europe, the offset deformable barrier test, is a more severe test of the vehicle structure and includes biomechanical requirements for the femur, tibia and knee joint (12). Most of the requirements were taken from work by Mertz (13). Those requirements are:- •The femur force should not exceed the force-time performance criterion given in figure 1. •The axial compression of the tibia should not exceed 8KN and the Tibia Index [= My/(Mc)y + Fz/(Fc)z] should not exceed 1, where (Mc)y (critical bending moment) = 225Nm and (Fc)z (critical compressive force) = 35.9KN. •The movement of the sliding knee joints shall not exceed 15mm. This paper examines real world lower limb injuries and crash conditions for belted drivers in frontal impacts which might be addressed by current and proposed barrier tests. METHODOLOGY An ongoing study into vehicle crash performance and occupant injury has been underway in Great Britain since November 1983 (14). Data for this analysis comprises information on crashes from the East and West Midlands region of England. The former is predominantly rural and the latter urban. Cars are examined at garages and vehicle dismantlers within a few days of the accident occurring. Only tow away cars less than six years old at the time of the accident are considered. Injury details are obtained from medical notes, and questionnaires sent to car occupants. All fatal accidents are investigated together with some 50 % of serious accidents and a further 12 % of slight accidents according to the National Road Accident system of classification. The resulting sample represents all levels of injury outcome while being biased towards the more serious and fatal cases. This should be borne in mind when interpreting results presented in this paper. Only occupants proven to be belted were included in the injury analysis. This was determined by markings on the belt webbing and associated hardware indicating occupant use of the belt. 851</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2: Classification of Frontal Impacts Vehicles with front end damage according to the Vehicle Deformation Classification (15) were classified by Frampton et al (16) into five classes (Fig 2). The class 1 impact was considered to be the type of crash an appropriate barrier test might address. In this data set, class 1 formed the majority of frontal impacts at 72%. Other vehicle information was available concerning the deformation geometry of the front end crush (17) and the amount of residual facia and footwell intrusion into the passenger compartment. Where possible the severity of the impact was estimated using the CRASH3 computer programme to give an Equivalent Test speed (ETS). The lower extremity was divided into five regions of pelvis, thigh, knee, leg and ankle /foot. In this analysis the term lower limb refers collectively to those five regions. The pelvis region included only injuries to the bony pelvis and hip dislocations. For the other regions injuries included surface lesions and injuries to vessels, nerves, muscles, tendons, ligaments, skeletal joints and bones. Fractures of the medial and lateral malleoli were included as part of the foot/ ankle region. A comprehensive overview of the anatomy is given by Huelke (18). Injuries to the lower limb were classified according to the AIS 90 (19) and the IIS 94 (20). That necessitated a conversion of injury codes from AIS 85 (21) by a similar method to that used by Bradford et al (22). The criteria used for sample selection is shown below and gave 1297 cars with belted drivers. All the cars were right hand drive and only drivers were considered in this analysis. 1. Belted driver. 2. Injury outcome known. 3. Class 1 frontal impact. 852</page><page sequence="4">RESULTS Table 1: Frequency of Maximum AIS and IIS for Lower Limbs AIS Drivers N % IIS Drivers N % No Injury 603 46% No Injury 603 46% 1 527 41% 0 596 46% 2 108 8% 1 76 6% 3 59 5% 2 21 2% 3 1 Total 1297 100% 1297 100% CHARACTERISTICS OF LOWER LIMB INIURIES The distribution of the maximum AIS and IIS to the lower limbs is shown in table 1. More than half (54%) of drivers received an injury to the lower limb. Although the majority of these were AIS 1 surface injuries it does suggest that lower limb contact with the vehicle interior is a common occurrence for belted drivers. 167 (13%) received at least an AIS 2 injury and 98 (8%) received at least an IIS score of 1. It has been argued that it is better to assess lower limb injury by impairment rather than threat to life. Lower limb injuries that only receive an AIS score of 2 and an IIS score of 0 (e.g. some fibula fractures) are not important in terms of immediate threat to life or impairment at one year post injury, but they may still result in much pain and short term loss of productivity. Therefore lower limb injuries with either AIS &gt; 2 or IIS &gt; 1 scores were considered to be important. Those injuries are shown in table 2 for each region of the lower limb.

That is illustrated here where unspecified AIS 2 leg and foot fractures and some tibia fractures received an IIS score of 0. In this respect there may be some underestimating of impairment. Despite that, fracture still contributed significantly to both AIS &gt; 2 and IIS &gt; 1 injury for every region of the lower limb. Also of note were AIS 1 injuries which rated some impairment. Those were subtalar, transtarsal and transmetatarsal joint dislocations. Figure 3 provides a comparison of the relative importance of the lower limb injuries by region for drivers with AIS &gt; 2 and drivers with IIS &gt; 1 lower limb injury. Fig 3: AIS &gt; 2 and IIS &gt;1 Lower Limb Injury by Region 854</page><page sequence="6">The ankle /foot region accounted for the greater proportion of both the AIS &gt; 2 and IIS &gt; 1 count. Injuries to the knee and pelvis increased in importance when only impairment was considered but the thigh, although accounting for the second highest proportion in the AIS &gt; 2 count, hardly featured at all in impairment. This is because the long term results of well treated femur fractures are generally good. It should be noted however that, in terms of serious threat to life (AIS &gt; 3), femur and pelvic fractures are the most important lower limb injuries. The overall maximum IIS score might be the same for an occupant with only one injured limb as for an occupant with two injured limbs or multiple injuries to several lower limb regions. In those circumstances it would be reasonable to assume that the relative impairment would be different for each occupant. Table 3 examines the frequency of lower limb fractures for drivers with left limb fracture only, right limb fracture only and for those with both limbs fractured together. It shows that drivers suffer more fractures of the right lower limbs than of the left. These observations were tested in table 4 where right and left limb fracture rates were compared and results are shown from chi-squared tests. From table 4 we can say that, for the lower limb as a whole (excluding the pelvis), belted drivers received more right limb fractures, and that the right thigh and right ankle/foot sustained those extra fractures. The reasons for that unilateral injury warrant further investigation.

The presence of intrusion should not be assumed to be part of the actual mechanism causing the injuries. Given that interior contact occurs, increasing forces may be expected at the lower limbs with increasing impact speed. With increasing speed greater intrusion occurs. Both are outcomes of crash severity. There are however a variety of factors which influence how much intrusion will occur for a given impact speed. One prime factor concerns how much of the car front is involved in the collision. Here direct contact overlap with the struck obstacle was expressed as a percentage of the vehicle width. Figure 4 illustrates how overlap influenced the rate of impairment and serious lower limb injury rates for the 1297 belted drivers in the sample. Increasing overlap from the left should increase deceleration and intrusion for the driver. These effects were borne out by increasing injury rates. Decreasing overlap to the right should decrease deceleration and increase intrusion. Overlap offset to the right was associated with a higher rate of AIS &gt; 2 and IIS &gt; 1 injury than overlap offset to the left, but injury rates did not increase to the right because there was a right offset wide overlap (65-84%) condition which gave an unusually high rate of injury. It was hypothesised that this could be an impact type giving a greater load concentration on the right side of the vehicle despite having wide overlap. Previous work by Hill et al (17) had identified such a wide overlap type of impact producing high rates of serious injury to other body regions. It was decided to control for crash severity and compare the rate of AIS &gt; 2 lower limb injury for small overlap impacts and wide overlap impacts with 856</page><page sequence="8">Table 5: Lower limb Maximum AIS &gt; 2 Injury Rate by Impact Type ETS (Km/h) Wide Overlap. Loading Small Right Overlap Concentrated to the Right Lower Limb Injury Rate Lower Limb Injury Rate &lt; 20 0% 0% 21-30 5% 5% 31-40 16% 17% 41-50 27% 24% 51-60 42% 32% &gt; 61 68% 58% N=228 Drivers N=226 Drivers Median Overlap=72% Median Overlap=33% asymmetrical damage. The definitions of those impact types are shown below. •Small overlap:- Overlap from the right of &lt; 50% of the front face. •Wide overlap with asymmetric damage:- Overlap from the right of &gt; 50% of the front face with a damage profile of &gt; 10° over at least half of the front face. 10° was chosen because this was the lower limit at which crush profiles were recognisably oblique, maximum crush being at the right corner. After controlling for crash severity the wide overlap type of impact gave equally large rates of injury as the small overlaps (table 5). This indicated that wide overlap giving asymmetric damage could cause the peak injury rates shown in figure 4. That was demonstrated by removing those impacts from the 65-84% right overlap group to give a decrease in injury rate shown by the dotted lines. This showed that even where more than 2/3rds of the vehicle front face was impacted, asymmetric right side loading conditions had a significant effect on injury rate. The relationship between passenger shell intrusion, crash severity and lower limb injury was investigated for impacts overlapped toward the driver's side. Vehicles were selected if direct contact on the struck object had overlapped up to 85% from the right. AIS &gt; 2 injuries to the pelvis, thigh or knee were considered relevant for comparison with driver's side facia intrusion. AIS &gt; 2 ankle/foot injuries were compared with driver's side footwell intrusion. Intrusion values from 0 to 2cm will be referred to as zero intrusion. Figures 5 and 6 indicate the distribution of rates at which drivers received at least one injury over the relevant lower limb regions. While confidence intervals were not calculated for injury rates, it is important to bear in mind that some rates had to be determined from small counts. An injury rate was considered to be unreliable if the expected frequency of injuries or vehicles was found to be less than one for any given combination of ETS and intrusion. In the majority of vehicles intrusion did not exceed 55cm at facia and 65cm at footwell, although two vehicles had footwell intrusion greater than 80 cm. From this analysis the following can be concluded:- Facia intrusion and injuries &gt; AIS 2 at the pelvis, thigh and knee • Injury risk increased with both intrusion and crash severity. • Rates were highest (16 to 56%) for intrusion &gt; 12cm and ETS &gt; 30 Km/h. 857</page><page sequence="9">Figure 5 : Drivers'-Side Facia Intrusion vs. ETS showing Injury Rates for the Drivers' Pelvis/thigh/knee Regions 858</page><page sequence="10">Figure 6 : Drivers'-side Footwell Intrusion vs. ETS showing Injury Rates for the Drivers' Ankle/foot Regions 859</page><page sequence="11">• Injury rates remained low at all crash severities provided intrusion was &lt; 12cm. • Seven drivers were injured with zero intrusion. Their details are shown in table 6. It is important to emphasise that zero facia intrusion occurred as a result of lower energy crashes (ETS &lt; 50 Km/h) in very many cases (259 out of 478) . We can reasonably assume that the greater proportion of tow away crashes in the population will also be of that type. Therefore it is a matter of concern that injury rates may be as high as 3%, with zero intrusion occurring. Two patella fractures and one knee joint laceration were sustained by contact with the steering column cladding leaving imprints and cracking in the hard plastic material. Rupture and sprain in the knee joint could be caused by sudden rotation about the joint itself. It is easy to imagine this occurring where the driver's knee was wedged in the heater vent for example. One patella fracture left no evidence of contact at all. It should be noted that transverse patella fractures can occur due to a sudden contraction of the quadriceps muscle while the knee is in flexion without any direct violence to the knee itself (23, 24, 25). That injury mechanism may be worth investigating in future work. Footwell intrusion and injuries &gt; AIS 2 at the ankle and foot • Injury risk increased with both intrusion and crash severity. • Rates were highest when intrusion exceeded 12cm. • Only 2 drivers received injuries below 30 Km/h. • Four drivers were injured with zero intrusion. Their details are shown in table 7. One driver (in table 7) sustained metatarsal fracture from striking and bending the throttle pedal. There is, however, frequently no particular evidence of contact in the footwell region which complicates assessment of the injury mechanism. Of note are the displaced control pedals in a virtually undeformed footwell. The authors have noted this in certain other real world crashes where the pedals have rotated rearward and upward because of intrusion of the pedal box mounting at a point above the footwell.

Because of the impairment potential of those injuries, the recently introduced Injury Impairment Scale was used in addition to the AIS. Although not fully validated by retrospective studies it did provide more perspective than would have been possible using the AIS alone. One important question raised was how to consider injuries rating an IIS of 0 which could nevertheless be extremely debilitating in the short term. In terms of frequency, femur fractures rated very low on the Impairment scale, yet treatment often involves internal fixation (which eventually needs to be removed) and healing time can be six to twelve months. In terms of medical expense, time lost and pain suffered, this type of injury can carry a high cost. Use of the AIS showed the relatively high frequency of femur fracture. There appears to be a need for a measure to consider short term impairment (less than 1 year) especially for injuries which have such a high cost factor. What both injury rating systems emphasised was the importance of fracture in serious lower limb injury, especially to the ankle/ foot region. That agreed with previous work (1). Irrespective of crash severity, intrusion is clearly associated with those serious lower limb injuries. In terms of pelvis, thigh and knee injuries it is relatively easy to see how a direct load by the facia can cause fracture to one or more of those regions. Injury mechanisms for the ankle/foot region are more difficult to understand in the real world crash because the feet can be in a variety of positions at impact (1). Rarely is the evidence for foot position as conclusive as that shown in figure 7. Several researchers have considered ankle fracture of the right limb to occur while the right foot is on the brake pedal but do not agree about the injury mechanism. Both Morgan et al (1) and Begeman and Prasad (26) suggest that dorsiflexion is the mechanism while Lestina et al (27) suggest inversion or eversión. The preponderance of right ankle/foot fractures in right hand drive cars in this sample and also in left hand drive cars (1, 28) does suggest that there is a common position of the driver's right foot at impact which may contribute to injury. What we need to remember is that, in contrast to the United States, European cars generally have manual gearboxes. Therefore, in general the driver's footwell will contain three control pedals and a smaller brake pedal. That may influence foot placement and the nature of injury to the ankle /foot complex. The possible influence of foot placement on injury was recently described by Pilkey et al (29), but there is still scope for more work in determining the specific injury mechanisms involved. That equally applies to the problem regarding the higher incidence of right femur only fractures. Facia intrusion could be 861</page><page sequence="13">greater for the right limb than for the left limb. Or the position of the right foot on the brake pedal might cause right knee elevation into an intruding facia. Unfortunately the data collection procedures only allowed for an intrusion measure at one point on the facia. Future work should record a more detailed profile of intrusion. It would also be interesting to investigate whether left femur fracture is the most common in left hand drive vehicles and whether that was associated with more facia intrusion for the left limb. The accident data has demonstrated that frontal crash conditions with loading concentrated to the right side produced the highest risk of injury to the lower limbs. When viewed in conjunction with the threat of intrusion, it will be important to ensure that future legislative crash tests will load the car asymmetrically and test the structures in a manner similar to that found in real accidents. Despite the choice of one or other test, it should be noted however that AIS &gt; 2 and IIS &gt; 1 injuries do occur to the lower limbs under conditions of zero or very low intrusion in lower energy crashes. Those types of crash are of concern because of their high frequency in the tow away population. That general point has also been stressed by Viano (30). It may be that in many cases the specific mechanism of injury is force applied through the sole of the foot. Such loads increase with increasing crash severity, as does intrusion. Diminishing intrusion however may not necessarily be the best remedial measure. It may be that padding in the footwell would diminish peak loads and thus reduce injury more effectively than merely aiming to reduce intrusion. More experimental work is needed to understand the specific mechanisms of leg and ankle/foot injuries and it should not be assumed that diminishing intrusion will necessarily relate to diminishing the rate of lower limb injuries. Other important issues not covered in this analysis concern the effects of population variances on the risk of lower limb injury. Occupant age can have an important influence on bone tolerance to fracture (31). Occupant height has also been associated with risk of injury (32). Although the fracture tolerance of the lower extremities can be calculated, injury mechanisms are not so well defined as for other body regions. The determination of the positioning of the lower limbs deserves more attention despite the difficulties involved in deducing this from the real world data. Future work might modify accident studies to collect more detailed crash and medical data relating to lower limb injury. Additionally, cadaver testing might be used to examine injury mechanisms deduced from field studies. Although that work is not possible in many countries such as the UK.
