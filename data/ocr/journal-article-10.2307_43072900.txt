<plain_text><page sequence="1">Everyday Miracle. Gustav Eckstein. 146p. $3.50. Harper and Row, Publishers, Inc., 49 East 33rd St., New York, N. Y. 10016. 1965. (Grades 2-5) "Everyday miracles" refers to un- usual happenings in the animal world amongst domesticated and ex- perimentally caged animals. A serious flaw is the overemphasis upon possible anthropomorphic in- terpretation of inexplicable animal behavior. Flights of fancy and mys- tical musings are inappropriate in a book written by a physiologist con- cerning observations on animal ac- tivity and are harmful to the sug- gestible mind of the young.</page></plain_text>
