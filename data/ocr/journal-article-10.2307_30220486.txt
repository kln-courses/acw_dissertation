<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Social-Cognitive Framework for Pedagogical Agents as Learning Companions O Yanghee Kim and Amy L. Baylor Teaching and learning are highly social activities. Seminal psychologists such as Vygotsky, Piaget, and Bandura have theorized that social interaction is a key mechanism in the process of learning and development. In particular, the benefits of peer interaction for learning and motivation in classrooms have been broadly demonstrated through empirical studies. Hence, it would be valuable ifcomputer-based environments could support a mechanism for a peer interaction. Though no claim of peer equivalence is made, pedagogical agents as learning companions (PALs)-animated digital characters functioning to simulate human-peer-like interaction-might provide an opportunity to simulate such social interaction in computer-based learning. In this article we ground the instructional potential of PALs in several social-cognitive theories, including distributed cognition, social interaction, and Bandura's social-cognitive theory. We discuss how specific concepts of the theories might support various instructional functions of PALs, acknowledging concepts that PALs cannot address. Based on the theoretical perspectives, we suggest key constituents for designing PALs that in human-peer interactions have proven significant. Finally, we review the current status of PAL research with respect to these constituents and suggest where further empirical research is necessary.

In particular, pedagogical agents can be designed to simulate social interaction that may facilitate learners to engage in the learning task and con- sequently to enhance learning in computer-based environments. Pedagogical agents are animated life-like characters (Johnson, Richel, &amp; Lester, 2000) embedded in instructional applications. What makes pedagogical agents unique from conventional computer-based environments is their ability to simulate social interaction. In pedagogical-agent-based environments, a learner grasps instructional content while interacting with one or more peda- gogical agents programmed to provide information and/or encouragement, to share menial tasks, or to collaborate with the learner. Some studies indi- cated the positive instructional impact of pedagogical agents on cognitive and motivational outcomes (Atkinson, 2002; Kim, 2004, 2005b; Moreno, Mayer, Spires, &amp; Lester, 2001). Figure 1 displays the motivator-expert combination of agents that jointly enhanced learning (Baylor &amp; Kim, 2003) and Nina, an agent that served as a social model to influence student attitudes toward engineering (Baylor &amp; Plant, 2005).

SO CIA L MODEL EXPERT- MOTIVATOR</page><page sequence="3">PEDAGOGICAL AGENTS AS LEARNING COMPANIONS (PALS) 571 Pedagogical agents may help overcome some constraints of and expand functionalities of conventional computer-based environments. Traditionally, computer-based learning environments (e.g., intelligent tutoring systems) have been tailored to meet a student's individual needs, supporting each learner independently when the environments were well designed (Aimeur &amp; Frasson, 1996; Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, &amp; Pelletier, 1995; Gertner &amp; VanLehn, 2000; Graesser, VanLehn, Rose, Jordan, &amp; Harter, 2001). However, those learning environments typically failed to provide situated social interac- tion, which is regarded as a significant influence on both learning and motiva- tion (Lave &amp; Wenger, 2001; Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984; Powell, Aeby, &amp; Carpenter-Aeby, 2003; Vygotsky, Cole, John-Steiner, Scribner, &amp; Souberman, 1978; Wertsch, Minick, &amp; Arns, 1984). With the advances of technology, peda- gogical agents can be designed to support the social-cognitive aspect of learn- ing in computer-based environments, playing well-defined instructional roles, following specified social conventions, and even responding to learners with apparent empathy (Hays-Roth &amp; Doyle, 1998). As Reeves and Nass (1996) con- cluded from more than 10 years of studies, people may apply the same social rules and expectations to computers as they do to humans in the real world. Thus, the simulated social presence of pedagogical agents in computing envi- ronments may provide learners with a sense of companionship and so make working in the computer-based environment relevant and/or meaningful (Biswas, Schwartz, &amp; Bransford, 2001). In general, it is recommended that a pedagogical agent should have a human-like persona to better simulate social contexts and to promote learner- agent interaction (Erickson, 1997; Koda &amp; Maes, 1996; Laurel, 1990; Lester et al., 1997; Mulken, Andre, &amp; Muller, 1998; Takeuchi &amp; Naito, 1995; Walker, Sproull, &amp; Subramani, 1994). Likewise, pedagogical agents as simulated beings are frequently designed to represent different human instructional roles, such as expert (Johnson et al., 2000), tutor (Graesser, Moreno, &amp; Marineau, 2003), mentor (Baylor &amp; Kim, 2005), and learning companion (Chan &amp; Baskin, 1990; Dillenbourg &amp; Self, 1992; Goodman, Soller, Linton, &amp; Gaimari, 1998; Hietala &amp; Niemirepo, 1998a; Kim, 2003b; Uresti, 2000). For example, the agents, Steve and Adele, developed by Johnson and colleagues (2000), repre- sent experts for naval engineering and medical diagnosis. These agents observe learner performance to provide adaptive feedback and demonstrate expertise in the domain. Similarly, AutoTutor (Graesser et al., 2003) is designed to engage learners in a dialogue to highlight their misconceptions and to encourage deeper reasoning. Baylor and Kim (2005) effectively simu- lated agents as an expert, a motivator, and a mentor serving distinct instruc- tional functions: the expert provided the learner with relevant information in a professional manner; the motivator provided verbal persuasion and encour-</page><page sequence="4">572 KIM AND BAYLOR agement, emphasizing affective affiliation with the learner; and the mentor incorporated both qualities to simulate an ideal instructor. In contrast to those agent roles, pedagogical agents as learning companions (PALs) adopt a peer metaphor, where the agent's function is to learn with the learner and act as a simulated peer. The following section discusses the potential benefits of employing the peer metaphor for designing pedagogical agents. PALs The value of human-peer interaction for learning and motivation has been emphasized at least since Bell and Lancaster initiated the systematic imple- mentation of peer-mediated learning in the late 18th century (Chiplin-Wil- liams, 1997). A number of peer-mediated interventions implemented in small- or large-scale studies demonstrate empirical evidence that peer partners are often more effective than adult partners for learning and motivation in various subject areas and across age groups (Griffin &amp; Griffin, 1998; King, 1998; Rowell, 2002; Topping et al., 1997; Yarrow &amp; Topping, 2001). The benefit of peer interaction is also supported by theories of social cogni- tion and learning. According to Bandura (1997), a great deal of psychological modeling occurs when learners observe behaviors of their everyday associ- ates. When learners are exposed differentially to skilled human peers or to adults performing the same cognitive skills, they derive a stronger sense of personal efficacy from the peers. Further, social interaction with equally able peers fosters cognitive restructuring and promotes cognitive growth (Piaget, 1995), in that intellectual development, thinking, and affect are closely tied with the cooperation of equal partners (Matusov &amp; Hayes, 2000) and peer interaction can provide a free and open forum to facilitate a more active and productive exchange of ideas (Driscoll, 2000). Clearly, interactions with actual peers are the ideal. However, human-peer-based interventions are not always feasible or successful in implementation, for logistical and political reasons, for example, matching optimal peers, coordinating schedules, and avoiding off-task distractions (Kim, 2004; King, 1998). Though they are clearly not equivalent to human peers, PALs-computerized virtual peers-may be able to simulate peer interaction in computer-based environments, as demon- strated in some studies (Biswas et al., 2001; Brophy, Biswas, Katzlberger, Bransford, &amp; Schwartz, 1999; Ryokai, Vaucelle, &amp; Cassell, 2003). Figure 2 shows examples of such PALs used in previous studies (Kim, 2004, 2005b): male and female Chris for college students and Riya for elementary school girls. Although the current technology cannot now-and likely will never- duplicate all aspects of human peer interaction in PAL-learner interaction, it is</page><page sequence="5">PEDAGOGICAL AGENTS AS LEARNING COMPANIONS (PALS) 573 Figure 2 D] Examples of pedagogical agents as learning companions (PALs). Female Chris Male Chris Riya worth noting that the learners in the studies reacted socially to the PALs and perceived the PALs as being more functional and more intelligent than they actually were. From a researcher's point of view, PALs can also be used as a methodolog- ical tool to study human-peer interaction because instructional designers can easily manipulate PAL characteristics and functions to serve instructional goals at times when human peers are not available. That approach is not new in the fields of social psychology and communication. Researchers in those areas have already begun to employ virtual environments with digital charac- ters to study social interaction in the real world (Bailenson &amp; Yee, in press; Blascovich et al., 2002). They use computer capabilities to archive detailed records of all verbal and nonverbal behavior of users and to regulate the fre- quency, thoroughness, and intensity of the behavior of the virtual characters. Similarly, the flexibility in manipulating PAL characteristics may allow instructional designers and educational researchers to use the PAL as a mech- anism for theory development. For instance, to support learning in context, PALs could be designed as peer tutors or peer tutees with varying levels of competency (Chan &amp; Chou, 1997; Kim, 2003a). The gender or ethnicity of PALs can be matched with that of learner to facilitate collaboration, resulting in enhanced modeling effects (Baylor &amp; Kim, 2004; Cooper &amp; Weaver, 2003). Or the number of PALs can be adjusted to optimize collaboration (Hietala &amp; Niemirepo, 1998b; White, Shimoda, &amp; Fredericksen, 2000). Although the popularity of PAL applications in computing environments has been increasing both in academia and in business, there is limited empiri- cal research regarding their efficacy. Furthermore, the theoretical foundation for the application and design of PALs has not yet been built. Hence, the remainder of this article will ground the instructional application of PALs in a</page><page sequence="6">574 KIM AND BAYLOR social-cognitive framework, will discuss critical constituents for designing PALs, and will review the current status of findings from PAL research with respect to these constituents. A SOCIAL-COGNITIVE FRAMEWORK Social-cognitive theories emphasize that teaching and learning are highly social activities and that interactions with teachers, peers, and instructional materials influence the cognitive and affective development of learners. When individuals perform intellectual activities, they dynamically interact with other participants, tools, and contexts, which could support improved perfor- mance and/or frame individual cognition and intellect. Therefore, interven- tions failing to address the social-cognitive dimension of learning and intelligence might not accomplish their goals (Perkins, 2001). It is warranted, then, that computer-based environments should be designed to afford this social-cognitive dimension. This section examines how social-cognitive per- spectives might serve as a theoretical framework for and a guide to the optimal design of PALs. Three social-cognitive theories are reviewed here: (a) distrib- uted cognition, (b) social interaction as addressed in the work of Piaget and Vygotsky, and (c) Bandura's social-cognitive theory. Given the three theoreti- cal perspectives, the varying instructional functions of PALs are suggested in light of each. Distributed Cognition Human cognition is distributed among individuals and across tools and sym- bols in a society (Hewitt &amp; Scardamalia, 1998; King, 1998; Pea, 2001; Perkins, 2001; Salomon, 1988, 1989,1990, 2001; Salomon &amp; Almog, 1998). Traditionally, it is presumed that cognition exists inside an individual's mind and that the cognitive process occurs internally. Recently, however, a number of research- ers have suggested that the human mind rarely works in solo; instead, it is shaped in social contexts while the individual is communicating within phys- ical and social surroundings. In their daily surroundings it is not difficult to see that such artifacts as letters on a keyboard, a shopping list, graphs and dia- grams, and calculators help individuals better perform cognitive activities and expand their cognitive capabilities. One's cognition also evolves through dis- course with others. In effective conversation, one makes a statement based on the previous utterance of one's interlocutor. According to this line of thought, PALs could be designed to share learners' cognition and flexibly function as artifacts (cognitive tools) or collaborating partners (social tools). PALs as cognitive tools could scaffold learner perfor-</page><page sequence="7">PEDAGOGICAL AGENTS AS LEARNING COMPANIONS (PALS) 575 mance, where PALs were equipped with knowledge and skills that learners would not have, or could perform simple and mechanical tasks to preserve the cognitive capabilities of the learner for higher mental activities. PALs could learn with the learner and/or take turns generating ideas. The presence of PALs on the screen and their responsiveness to the learner's behavior could also provide social contexts (PALs as social tools), in which learners could build social relations with the PALs (Ruttkay &amp; Pelachaud, 2004; Suzuki, Takechi, Ishii, &amp; Okada, 2003). In either or both ways, PALs could play a role of coworking partners, building intellectual partnership for enhanced learning in computer-based environments. Researchers in distributed cognition, however, vary in their interpreta- tions-some focusing more on individuals and others on contexts. According to Perkins (2001), individuals and their surroundings are compound systems of thinking and learning (person-plus). But there is still higher-order knowl- edge, in individuals' minds, that cannot be distributed. Thus, for Perkins, there is an asymmetry in distributed cognition and, possibly, in the relationship between a learner and a PAL. In this perspective, a learner could be expected to play a more active role in performing learning tasks than would a PAL. However, others, for example, Lave and Wenger (2001), argued that cognition spreads over minds, artifacts, social processes, and cultural factors, compris- ing an interdependent and inseparable system of cognition (sociocultural cog- nition). Learning and thinking take place during communication with others in a social context. The dynamic nature of the cognitive process is emphasized. In this perspective, a PAL could be viewed as creating a more interactive social environment and making learning part of a social process (Biswas et al., 2001). The perspective one takes determines the composition of learner-PAL rela- tionships. That is, the perspective centering on person-plus argues for an inter- vention emphasizing the learner's actions and responsibility. A PAL could be activat Lastly, Salomon (1990) argued for two types of cognitive effects that chil- dren could attain in computer-mediated learning. Effects of technology are the cognitive skills resulting from the use of technology. PALs can be equipped with information and designed to demonstrate skills so that a learner can mas- ter the information and those skills at the end of the lesson. On the other hand, working at computers, learners employ unique mental operations that they could not carry out otherwise. Effects with technology are cognitive changes derived from working with computer software itself. Similarly, interaction with a PAL could have a unique impact on the learner's cognition, subse- quently producing a unique intellectual partnership between them. Table 1 illustrates the key concepts of distributed cognition and the functions of PALs suggested by the concepts.</page><page sequence="8">576 KIM AND BAYLOR Table 1 El Concepts of distributed cognition and functions of pedagogical agents as learning companions (PALs). Concepts Functions of PALs Person-plus cognition Remain less visible or activated only on learners' requests. Sociocultural cognition Actively interact with learners to create social contexts for learning. Effect of technology Facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and skills. Effect with technology Function as intellectual partners to collaborate and make learning a social process Social Interaction Learning is a social process. Intellectual development is achieved when learn- ers are involved in learning activities in which they interact with others (Vygotsky et al., 1978). Learners come to understand phenomena through negotiating meanings with people in the environment, and they achieve goals through interacting, both explicitly and implicitly, with the instructor, peers, materials, and atmosphere embedded in the context. Unlike traditional com- puter-based learning, which seemingly was limited to knowledge and skill acquisition, PALs as simulated peers could simulate a type of social interac- tion, making computer-based learning more meaningful. The theoretical con- cepts illustrated below stress the importance of social interaction for intellectual development, from which we draw implications for designing PALs that are educationally effective and appealing. Cognitive Conflict and Equal Power Relations Neo-Piagetian psychologists have argued that Piaget's theory is "fundamen- tally social" (Bickhard, 2004; Carpendale &amp; Muller, 2004). In Piaget's theory, cooperation and free discussion play an essential role in acquiring and con- structing knowledge because they establish the most favorable conditions for counteracting an individual's egocentrism. In particular, Piaget acknowl- edged the value of peer interaction in terms of equal power relations and cog- nitive conflicts (Tudge &amp; Winterhoff, 1993). He argued that high-level development in thinking and affect is not possible without the cooperation of equal partners (Matusov &amp; Hayes, 2000). This is because equal power relations among peers allow learners to actively take different perspectives. By examin- ing the perspectives of peers, learners can progress to and reflect on their own ideas and coordinate actions and perspectives to resolve contradictions among</page><page sequence="9">PEDAGOGICAL AGENTS AS LEARNING COMPANIONS (PALS) 577 the different perspectives, which Piaget referred to as sociocognitive conflict. Clearly, PAL-learner interaction is equivalent towith human-peer interaction. Even so, PALs designed not necessarily to command advanced knowledge but to bring forth different perspectives could serve to instigate learners' cognitive conflict in computer-based environments. This kind of use of equally or less competent peers has been subject to experimentation in both classrooms and tutoring systems, where students learned by teaching their peers or the system (Chan, 1996; Gartner, Kohler, &amp; Riessman, 1971; Goodlad &amp; Hirst, 1989). The Zone of Proximal Development and Scaffolding Vygotsky's (Vygotsky et al., 1978) concept of the zone of proximal develop- ment (ZPD) is at the center of learning and developmental processes. ZPD, the distance between a learner's actual development and his or her potential development assisted by others, defines developmental functions that have not yet matured but are in the process of maturation. In collaboration with more capable others, learners can grow intellectually beyond the current limit of their capabilities. Along this line, a PAL might be designed to be in a higher intellectual stage than that of the learner, to provide a scaffolding to advance the learner's knowledge. Effectively designed PALs could simulate the five characteristics of scaffolding suggested by Greenfield (1984): (a) serving to provide supports; (b) functioning as tools by sharing learning tasks; (c) extend- ing the cognitive ranges of learners; (d) allowing the learners to accomplish tasks not possible otherwise; and (e) being used selectively to aid the learners when needed. Empathetic Relations Affective experience is a natural process of learning (Damasio, 1994; Forgas, 2001). When interacting with environments, a learner may experience a vari- ety of emotional states, such as interest, curiosity, excitement, confusion, frus- tration, and discouragement (Kort, Reilly, &amp; Picard, 2001), all of which might influence learning and motivation. For instance, Bower and Forgas (2001) found that emotions and moods had an impact on social memories and their reconstruction: when learners' moods in learning tasks were matched with their moods in retrieval, the amount of retrieved information was significantly increased (mood congruency). Ellis, Ottaway, Varner, Becker, and Moore (1997) showed that the affective states of college students influenced their text com- prehension. Meyer and Turner (2002) reported that students of a negatively affective instructor experienced negative affect and handicapped themselves significantly more than did students of a positively affective instructor. Given the implications from the classroom-based emotion research, a PAL could be designed to address a learner's emotional states and subsequently</page><page sequence="10">578 KIM AND BAYLOR build empathetic relations with the learner (Dautenhahn, Bond, Canamero, &amp; Edmonds, 2002). More specifically, a PAL could express its own emotions and respond to learners' emotions in order to elicit a learner's positive emotions and to diminish negative emotions in learning contexts (Picard, 1997). Also, an important mechanism of emotional development of children through adoles- cence is socialization by peers (Asher, Parker, &amp; Walker, 1996). Friends are likely to disclose to each other the emotional understandings and experiences they may hide from others (e.g., adults), helping each other acquire emotional competencies. Simulating a human peer, a PAL can be equipped with a variety of emotional expressions and reactions designed to help a learner's emotional development (Denham &amp; Kochanoff, 2002). The inclusion of affect has been shown to make the PAL more believable and natural (Bates, 1994) and, subse- quently, may help establish social bonds between the learner and the PAL. Table 2 summarizes the key concepts of social interaction and different func- tions of PALs suggested by the concepts. Social-Cognitive Theory Social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986, 1989, 1999, 2001, 2002) uses the concept of human agency to explain human functioning in the world. (Agency or being an agent in the theory means that people intentionally make things happen by their action. Hence, agent should be distinguished from its use in pedagogical agents or PALs.) Social cognitive theory recognizes three modes of human Table 2 El Concepts of social interaction and functions of pedagogical agents as learning companions (PALs).

Respond with empathy to a learner's emotions.</page><page sequence="11">PEDAGOGICAL AGENTS AS LEARNING COMPANIONS (PALS) 579 agency: (a) personal, (b) proxy, and (c) collective. These modes can be related to learning concepts frequently referred toin educational research: personal agency to learner control; proxy agency to social modeling; and collective agency to collaboration. Personal Agency: Learner Control The concept of personal agency emphasizes learners' control over and self- regulation of their learning tasks. According to Bandura (2001), the essential capacity of humanness is to exercise control over the nature and quality of one's life. Through the exercise of personal agency, people can enhance their efficacy beliefs. With their own intention, learners may want to plan, select, motivate, regulate, and evaluate cognitive activities. Personal agency could also be consistently applied to computing environments. As in conventional computer-based environments indicating the positive motivational impact of learner control (Large, 1996), learners may increase self-efficacy beliefs when they initiate interaction and make decisions with less direction or control by PALs. To this end a PAL could be designed as a responsive partner, one that does not direct but rather responds to the learner's requests. This way the learner could exercise personal agency and, consequently, increase self-effi- cacy beliefs in the task. Of course, this presumed benefit of learner control appears to work with learner characteristics in traditional computer-based learning as well (Arnone, Grabowski, &amp; Rynd, 1994; Large, 1996; Ross, Morri- son, &amp; O'dell, 1989); thus, a designer should include such learner characteris- tics as competency, age, learning styles, and so forth in determining the optimal design of PAL-learner interaction. Proxy Agency: Social Modeling Proxy agency is socially mediated agency, which enables people to get resources or expertise of others to accomplish what they desire. People's appraisals of their own efficacy are influenced through vicarious experience mediated through social models (Bandura, 1997). Learners actively search for competent models and take advantage of time, efforts, and resources of social models that will transmit the knowledge, skills, and strategies they seek. Recently, human-computer interaction research has indicated the potential of virtual characters (e.g., pedagogical agents) functioning as social models. Learners have seemed to consider the characters to be social entities. For instance, college students applied politeness norms (Mayer, Johnson, Shaw, &amp; Sandhu, 2005), notions of self and other, and gender stereotypes while inter- acting with computers (Reeves &amp; Nass, 1996). Thus, a PAL that successfully performs the tasks may serve as a social model for enhanced motivation and learning in computer-based environments. Also, attribute similarity between</page><page sequence="12">580 KIM AND BAYLOR learners and social models significantly influences modeling effects in tradi- tional classrooms (Bandura, 1997; Schunk, 1987), so it seems plausible that the attributes or personal characteristics of a PAL might have an impact on learn- ers in computing environments (Kim, 2005a). Collective Agency: Collaboration Collective agency is exercised through group action. Individuals do not live in isolation but rather are interdependent in a variety of social contexts. In their everyday lives, people typically achieve goals through collective efforts with others. People have to pool their knowledge, skills, and resources; provide mutual support; and work together to secure what they cannot accomplish on their own (Bandura, 2002). Collaborative learning may take its place with the concept of collective agency. Supporting collaboration through various mech- anisms has been claimed in computer-based environments (Dillenbourg, Mendelsohn, &amp; Schneider, 1994). Toward that goal, PALs could be designed to promote the exercise of collective agency. The number of PALs can be adjusted to meet the instructional needs of the moment. In a multiple-PAL environ- ment, each PAL equipped with various domain-specific skills could share tasks by their expertise and thus collectively help a learner to achieve goals; also, the inclusion of multiple PALs could enhance the social richness of the environment. Table 3 summarizes the PAL functions with the concepts of social cognitive theory. Table 3 O Concepts of social cognitive theory and the roles of pedagogical agents as learning companions (PALs).

To summarize, distributed cognition may support intellectual partnership between a learner and a PAL. The concepts of social interaction could emphasize the intellectual and empathetic transactions between them. Social cognitive theory suggests multiple constructs of PALs, such as gender, ethnicity, and multiplicity (more than one PAL), which could render PALs as desirable social models. Each of these theories and concepts suggest a full spectrum of permutations in designing desirable characteristics of PALs. It should be acknowledged, of course, that the fruitful applications of PALs can evolve only with the advancement of agent technology and will be ensured by the empirical evidence of instructional impacts accumulated with time. In the following section, the design constituents of a PAL are discussed along with the research findings to date. CONSTITUENTS OF PALS Based on the review of the social-cognitive perspectives, seven design constit- uents of instructional PALs are proposed: (a) competency, (b) interaction type, (c) gender, (d) affect, (e) ethnicity, (f) multiplicity, and (g) feedback. Of these constituents, distributed cognition suggests PAL competency, interaction type, multiplicity, and feedback as relevant; the concepts of social interaction suggest PAL competency, interaction type, affect, and feedback; and the con- cepts of Bandura's social cognitive theory suggest PAL competency, interac- tion type, gender, affect, ethnicity, and multiplicity. Figure 3 presents the graphical representation of the constituents and the supporting concepts. The seven constituents are intended not as definitive but as suggestive for subse- quent research on PALs. Detailed discussions of each constituent and any related research follow. Competency PALs can be designed to achieve different levels of competency depending on the theoretical perspective. A PAL could be designed to demonstrate knowl- edge and skills maximizing the effect of technology (Salomon, 1990) or to advance the learner's knowledge in the zone of proximal development. Like- wise, the concept of proxy agency (social modeling) supports PAL compe- tency that is high, but not too high, to serve as a desirable social model for learning. As Bandura (2001) warned, a highly competent model could some-</page><page sequence="14">582 KIM AND BAYLOR Figure 3 O Constituents of pedagogical agents as learning companions Sela~aagg~ c Ebpa pame CCgW g Soo Radst E~ag W &amp; ia gy lstLe mom~ g~beh gassman Stem hermose ecmcopane/ ppI a ftmnomm~ OWN 8L0 P,..waw SEW ,,, n ENO M A " AN" owl" WW times impede the cultivation of personal competencies because the learner might unduly rely on the model's competency. Also, from a Piagetian perspec- tive, a PAL designed to have low-to-moderate ability could simulate an equal partner to instigate the learner's cognitive conflict. Among the constituents, PAL competency has gained attention frequently in research on both learning companions (Hietala &amp; Niemirepo, 1998a; Kim &amp; Baylor, 2006) and intelligent systems without anthropomorphism (Chan &amp; Chou, 1997; Palthepu, Greer, &amp; McCalla, 1991; Ur &amp; VanLehn, 1995; Uresti, 2000; Uresti &amp; Boulay, 2004). For instance, Kim and Baylor (2006) examined the desirable levels of PAL competency for college students learning introduc- tory instructional design. The study showed that highly competent PALs increased both male and female student applications of acquired knowledge whereas low competent PALs increased student self-efficacy beliefs in the domain. In the study, PAL interaction was not intelligent but pre-scripted, which could indicate that the PAL-learner interaction was somewhat limited. Similarly, Hietala and Niemirepo (1998a) examined how intelligent pedagogi- cal agents called EduAgents, strong or weak in the domain of math, facilitated or frustrated male and female 6th graders. They found that when the task was demanding, strong students (high IQ) more frequently asked for the strong agents' suggestions, whereas weak students (low IQ) asked more for weak agents' suggestions. This difference was not shown when the task was easy. Given the technological or methodological limitations of the studies, those findings may be too premature to generalize and should be interpreted as pre- liminary. It is also noted, however, that learners' showing increased self-effi- cacy after working with weak agents has been replicated consistently in other</page><page sequence="15">PEDAGOGICAL AGENTS AS LEARNING COMPANIONS (PALS) 583 studies (Baylor &amp; Kim, 2004, 2005). The educational use of this observation is worth exploring. Subsequent research is warranted to confirm the findings of the studies and to identify whether the optimal levels of PAL competency would interact with learner competency. Also, it would be desirable, as in any other educational interventions, for the long-term-based evidence to be estab- lished. Interaction Type The type of interaction between a PAL and a learner can be examined from two angles: (a) the control of interaction and (b) the content of interaction. Regarding interaction control, person-plus cognition (Perkins, 2001) sug- gested that learners should be active initiators in their cognitive activities. Sim- ilarly, the concept of personal agency (learner control), which emphasizes the value of self-monitoring, self-examination, and self-reflection, supports a learner's voluntary initiation of interactions with a PAL. In contrast, in light of sociocultural cognition (Lave &amp; Wenger, 2001), a PAL could simulate an active partner initiating interactions to promote the sense of social context. Kim and Baylor (2006) examined the effects of PAL interaction type (proactive vs. responsive) with 72 male and female college students learning instructional planning. The results indicated that students who worked with a PAL that proactively provided information achieved higher recall than students who worked with a PAL that responded only to a learner's requests. A detailed look revealed that students in the responsive PAL condition used the PAL's information less than might be desired. The study also showed that the proac- tive PAL tended to have a more positive impact on academically strong stu- dents whereas the responsive PAL tended to have a more positive impact on academically weak students. Regarding the content of interaction, a PAL can utilize a variety of dis- course functions, such as suggestion, argument, confirmation, and question- ing to scaffold learners in the zone of proximal development. Goodman and his colleagues (1998) suggested a learning triangle that illustrates the types of interaction exchanges between a learner and a partner: clarify, critique, explain, question, evaluate, articulate, reinforce, and justify. How to delineate these exchanges in PAL-learner interactions effectively needs to be deter- mined. Related to the content of interaction, Craig, Gholson, Ventura, Graesser, and Group (2000) examined the effect of learning companion dia- logue versus monologue with 48 college students in a domain of computer lit- eracy. Results showed that students who overheard the dialogue in which a virtual tutee asked a virtual tutor questions wrote significantly more proposi- tions in free recall and asked significantly more questions in the transfer task</page><page sequence="16">584 KIM AND BAYLOR than did students who overheard a monologue. Also, students who overheard the dialogue showed deeper-level reasoning. Research on the content of PAL- learner interaction seems wide open and could require multidisciplinary efforts. Instructional designers may be guided by the implications from class- room research, social psychology, and communication theories as well as human-computer interaction. Further, the design of PAL-learner interaction could be a function of technological advancement. That is, the naturalness of PAL-learner interaction appears to be critical for efficacy. Gender Issues of gender difference, of importance in cognitive and interaction styles, are especially salient in educational computing, a salience often attributed to male-oriented software (Cooper &amp; Weaver, 2003). Littleton, Light, Joiner, Messer, and Barnes (1998) reasoned that one of the difficulties girls have with learning from instructional software could be that characters (warrior-like in general) in those programs are not appealing to girls. This lack of identifica- tion with the characters may cause the girls to experience greater computer anxiety, lower interest, and poorer performance. PALs with friendly demea- nors could help to reduce such anxiety and to increase motivation in com- puter-based learning environments. In addition, according to Bandura (1997), similarities of personal characteristics between a social model and a learner (attribute similarity) often are predictive of the learner's efficacy beliefs and influence the success of social modeling. This principle may be applied to design PALs in computing environments, given the consistency between human-computer interaction and human-to-human interaction (Reeves &amp; Nass, 1996). Interestingly, the gender of PAL-of all the variables treated here-tends best to reflect human relationships in the real world. Kim and colleagues examined in several studies the effects of PAL gender on college students' social judgments, motivation, and learning. Both male and female college stu- dents perceived the persona of a male PAL more positively than that of a female PAL (Kim &amp; Baylor, 2005a); recalled more after they worked with a male PAL than with a female PAL (Kim &amp; Baylor, 2005b); and showed higher motivation toward and more favorable perceptions of male instructor agents over female agents (Baylor &amp; Kim, 2003, 2004). Those agents, differing only in gender, were morphed from one image and equipped with identical scripts, gestures, and emotions. Likewise, the study conducted by Moreno and col- leagues (2002) showed that male and female undergraduates applied gender stereotypes to animated tutor agents and that their stereotypic expectations affected learning. Stereotypic expectations of males and females in human</page><page sequence="17">PEDAGOGICAL AGENTS AS LEARNING COMPANIONS (PALS) 585 relationships (Carli, 2001) seem to be consistently applied to PAL-learner rela- tionships. However, given that gender awareness may differ across develop- mental stages, the application of the stereotypic bias to PAL-learner relations may vary according to learner age levels. Nonetheless, the remedial solutions to overcome the gender-related bias applied to computing environments will be worth pursuing. The motivation for overcoming this bias would be social, not instructional. Affect Given the integral nature of affect and cognition (Damasio, 1994), affective interaction between users and computers has recently been of particular inter- est in the fields of human-computer interaction and educational computing. For instance, when a program deliberately frustrated users playing games, the users persisted longer in the program than did the users in the control group (Scheirer, Fernandez, Klein, &amp; Picard, 2002). College students perceived peda- gogical agents as more interesting and engaging when the agents expressed affect (Elliott, Rickel, &amp; Lester, 1999; Okonkwo, 2003). As Saarni (2001) argued, emotional development of individuals is often attributed to immediate con- texts and relationships. It sounds plausible that a PAL designed to express positive emotions about the task might be used to stimulate a learner's posi- tive affect (Picard, 1997). In general, PAL affect is defined in terms of PAL capabilities of expressing their own affect and recognizing and responding to a learner's affect (Hudlicka, 2003; Picard, 1997). For affect recognition, researchers in the MIT Media Lab have developed systems to recognize a learner's affect, using hard- ware technology such as a pressure-sensitive mouse, a BlueTooth@ wireless skin conductivity sensor, a TekScan@ pressure sensor on a chair, a stereo head-tracking system, and Blue Eyes@ infrared-sensitive camera (Burleson, Picard, Perlin, &amp; Lippincott, 2004). It is reported that these technologies demonstrate approximately 80% accuracy in detecting discrete emotions, such as happy versus sad or angry versus calm. At present, capturing users' com- plex emotions seems challenging. Although the capability of responding to a learner's affect awaits the necessary technology, affective expression has already been nearby. Using software tools, designers can build realistic 3-D images with subtle emotional expressions without much difficulty. Each aspect of the PAL affective capabilities requires different technologies and resources to varying degrees; thus, their efficacy can be examined sepa- rately prior to the integrative efficacy. Kim (2004) examined the impact of PAL affective expressions and responses separately in two controlled experiments. For affective expression, based on the findings from human emotion research,</page><page sequence="18">586 KIM AND BAYLOR she examined whether the positive or negative moods of a PAL would differ- ently influence a learner's affective and cognitive characteristics. The partici- pants were 142 male and female college students learning introductory instructional designing. The results showed that students who worked with a PAL that expressed a positive mood perceived the PAL as significantly more facilitating to learning, more engaging, and more intelligent than did students working with a PAL that expressed a negative mood. The students with the positive PAL also rated their motivation to keep working with the PAL signif- icantly higher than did those with the negative PAL. Figure 4 presents male and female PALs, both named Chris, in the positive- and negative-affect con- ditions. In another experiment examining the impact of affective response, learners were asked to express their emotional states by clicking an emoticon presented on the screen; a PAL responded verbally with empathy or did not respond at all. Students showed significantly more interest and higher self- efficacy in the task when the PAL empathetically responded to their affect than when the PAL did not. In general, the positive impact of empathetic agents on learner motivation is steadily supported, but such an impact on learning is not reported frequently. Ethnicity With respect to the concept of attribute similarity (Bandura, 1997), models of the same ethnicity seem to be viewed as more credible and to instill stronger efficacy beliefs and behavioral intentions than models of other ethnicities. In a computer-mediated communication, college students who had similar-ethnic- ity partners presented more persuasive arguments and also elicited more con- formity to the partners' opinions and perceived their partners as more attractive and trustworthy than those who had different-ethnicity partners (Lee &amp; Nass, 1998). Given the implications, PAL ethnicity can be manipulated to match or mismatch with learner ethnicity to serve instructional purposes. Research focusing on learner-PAL ethnicity is rare, but some studies exam- ined the ethnicity of pedagogical agents in general. Baylor and Kim (2004) found that college students (Caucasian and African-American) who worked with agents of the same ethnicity as their own perceived the agents as more credible, more engaging, and more affable than did students who worked with agents of different ethnicity. This tendency appeared more strongly among African-American students than among Caucasian students. In con- trast, the ethnicity of pedagogical agents did not influence students' stereo- typic expectations and learning in a study conducted by Moreno and colleagues (2002). The implication of these studies for PALs may or may not be consistent, given the distinctive role of PALs as simulated peers.</page><page sequence="19">PEDAGOGICAL AGENTS AS LEARNING COMPANIONS (PALS) 587 Figure 4 Chris in positive and negative affect. -i-iiiiii -ii. fii':iiiiiiii~;~Riililiiiffl':r il~iiiiiiiiii~iliiiiiiiii~iiiii iiiiliii~~:~~t... Chris in the positive mood Chris in the negative mood Multiplicity When learners are exposed to multiple social models, they may produce stronger beliefs in their ability to learn (Bandura, 1997). Bandura argued that diversified models of widely different characteristics are superior to a single model. To apply this principle, a PAL-based environment may include multi- ple PALs with varying perspectives or domain-specific skills. For instance, in a computer-based inquiry learning environment, SCI-WISE, White and col- leagues (2000) provided young learners at the elementary level with multiple peer-like advisers, such as a planner, an inventor, and a collaborator, so as to facilitate collaborative inquiry and reflective learning. Hietala and Niemirepo (1998a, 1998b) also implemented two male and two female learning compan- ions with varying competencies to facilitate collaboration with 6th graders learning math. The learners were able to choose a learning companion to work with, and their selections were closely related to the learners' academic com- petencies. For the enhanced efficacy of multiple PALs in an environment, there are some issues that should be examined in research: the optimal size of a PAL social group, the roles of PALs (e.g., peer tutee, tutor, trouble-maker, or helper), effective ways to coordinate multiple PALs to keep from confusion or even distraction, and the strategies to manage or control the behaviors of a PAL in accord with one another. Feedback Learners in the zone of proximal development may benefit from the effective use of feedback as a scaffolding strategy. The provision of clear informative feedback to a learner's performance facilitates cognitive growth in peer collab-</page><page sequence="20">588 KIM AND BAYLOR oration (Tudge, Winterhoff, &amp; Hogan, 1996). Also, verbally persuading learn- ers that they can master skills encourages them to exert greater efforts and sus- tain them (Bandura, 1997). Schunk and Lilly (1984) showed that the different types of performance feedback had differential effects on learner self-efficacy. In computer-based environments, learners often lack skills in the effective use of help messages (Aleven, Stahl, Schworm, Fischer, &amp; Wallace, 2003), so PAL feedback should be designed to ensure their effectiveness. In general, PAL feedback relating to PAL interaction type has been least studied among the suggested design constituents. To design PAL feedback effectively, multi- ple factors could be considered simultaneously, such as feedback type (infor- mative vs. motivational), scope (general vs. context specific), timing (immediate vs. delayed), learner characteristics (e.g., metacognitive skills, motivational levels, and learning styles), and learning goals and contexts. In summary, the social-cognitive framework for PAL design led to drawing the seven design constituents of PALs. Readers will notice that the extent of understanding of and the technology for each constituent differ. Some constit- uents have been investigated more frequently and can be more easily imple- mented than other constituents. Also, suggestions for the optimal design of a constituent are sometimes contradictory, necessitating subsequent research to gradually resolve the differences. Table 4 summarizes the discussions of the PAL constituents. CONCLUSION As stated earlier, this article is not an argument for replacing human peers with PALs. Rather, we attempted to base the instructional application and design of PALs in a social-cognitive framework so as to address social-cogni- tive dimensions of learning in computing environments. The ideal form of instruction could well be human tutoring (Bloom, 1984), where a learner can benefit from individualized cognitive guidance through dynamic social inter- action. But given the challenges of providing such an ideal environment, com- puter-based learning should aspire to simulate that environment. Some computer-based tutoring systems have reported success in providing individ- ualized cognitive guidance to a learner (Koedinger &amp; Anderson, 1997), but their impact has always been-as is to be expected-much weaker than that of human tutoring. What has been missing in these computer-based systems? Perhaps learners miss empathetic social encouragements and caring. Given the findings from human-computer interaction, PALs simulating human instructional roles may prove a useful tool for creating social environments in computer-based learning.

To provide concrete guidance for researchers interested in PAL, we sug- gested seven design constituents of PALs drawn from social-cognitive per- spectives. Yet these constituents are not comprehensive; the review of literature is rather modest. More important, it should be noted that research on PAL constituents has been very limited and that the studies reviewed in this article may sometimes bring more questions than answers. PALs is an emerg- ing technology and may keep evolving with technological advancement and subsequent research. The findings from the research might produce more con- stituents and lead to increased sophistication of PAL design. In spite of the potential usability of PAL-based environments, this article ends with some cautions. First, the naturalness of PAL behavior may be crucial to fostering social relations with learners. The current status of PAL technol- ogy is rather limited in creating desirable naturalness. In that regard, second, PALs may require intelligence (e.g., dynamic interaction and adaptive feed- back) to substantiate their instructional potential. Currently, technology can- not fully feature intelligent PALs. Third, even without artificial intelligence, to design and develop PALs is technologically demanding. Although there are some ready-made agents available (e.g., Microsoft Agent@ characters), it is usually necessary for researchers to develop their own PALs according to spe- cific research variables. Fourth, research on PALs is inevitably multidiscipli- nary and may involve researchers in instructional design, cognitive psychology, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, social psy- chology, and communication. Although this can be advantageous in promot- ing more ecologically valid research, it can be a challenge to coordinate collaborative efforts among such diverse fields. The efforts are worth making.
