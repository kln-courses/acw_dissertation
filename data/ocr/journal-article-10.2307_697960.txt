THE first instalment of Mr. Cook's great work will fully reward the ex- pectations of scholars. They will find in it a very exhaustive collection of matter, treated with the boldness and ingenuity which they associate with the writer, and though they will pro- bably find themselves differing often, sometimes differing violently, from Mr. Cook's conclusions, they will be able to get the materials for their arguments from the book itself, and to thank the author for many happy sug- gestions. The Cambridge Press also has done its part well; the illustrations are very numerous and good, though some of the plates would have been easier to use if they had been less deeply embedded in the volume - in other words, if the volume had been divided into two. A great part of the present work is not about Zeus, but it is none the worse for that. Zeus is described at the outset as the god of the Bright Sky; but it is argued that the original object of worship in pre-Hellenic times was the Bright Sky itself, and (I think unsuccess- fully) that traces of this cult survived in popular belief into Hellenic times. There follows a very valuable discussion of the mountain-cults of the god, who as the god of the Sky had his seat on the tops of the highest mountains; the first discussed are those of Zeus Lykaios (regarded by Mr. Cook as the god of Light, not primarily the Wolf-god) and Zeus Olympios. (Homeric scholars will note the author's view that Olym- pus in Homer is always the actual mountain.) The development of the mountain-cults, and of the conception of the mountain as the birth-place, the throne and the burial-place of Zeus, is next explained and illustrated, and the disappearance of them in the Christian era before the cult of Elias, just as other Hellenic deities became half- Christianised. Mr. Cook's account of these processes is full of interest. The author then passes on to the relation of the Sky-god to the great lights in the sky, and the greater part of the present volume is concerned with the solar cults, many of which are described and discussed very minutely, with a brief paragraph here and there, either to indicate that they had no original relation to that of Zeus, or to show how they came to be connected with that of Zeus by a conscious or uncon- scious syncretism. Mr. Cook maintains that although in course of time 'Zeus was brought into close connection with any and every celestial luminary,' yet 'genuine Hellenic religion never identi- fied Zeus with sun or moon or star'; and most of the volume is an amplifica- tion of this text. The discussion takes the reader very far afield. For a hundred pages or more he will find himself dealing with solar wheels and disks, and with all the mythological personages who were connected with wheels; then with the ' Lycian symbol' and the triskeles, and with Cyclopes and other monsters, who are supposed by Mr. Cook to be anthropomorphised versions of such solar symbols; and afterwards with a great variety of Ram- and Bull-cults, and their relation to that of Zeus, who was sometimes a Ram-god, sometimes a Bull-god, but is not thereby proved to have been a solar god, since the Ram and the Bull were symbols of the fertilising virtue of the sky no less than of the sun. Further, we have a somewhat lengthy treatment of Dionysiac cults, which are brought in on the strength of the hypothesis that Dionysus (whether in his Cretan form, Zagreus, or in Thracian cults) is but Zeus re-born; and, among them, of Tragedy, Comedy, and Satyric Drama. The notion of the Bull-god leads to a long discussion of Egyptian rites, and of the Cretan bull-legends; incidentally some fifty pages are devoted to the</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 81 Labyrinth of Minos, to the bull-fights and dances of Knossos and other places, and the meaning of ritual horns; and nearly one hundred pages to some im- portant Syrian cults, blended in late times with those of Zeus. This enumeration of subjects-and it is very far from complete-is sufficient to show that it is impossible to give any adequate criticism of the book in a review; and I shrink from making generalisations, which it would not be possible here to support by evidence. But the impression which remains most strongly in my mind is that of the need of something like a Grammar or Logic of Religionswissenschaft. I find myself perpetually asking for a critical account of the different kinds of evidence em- ployed, and of the proper use of them; and in almost every place where I venture to differ from Mr. Cook (and such places are inevitably many in the course of eight hundred pages), I find that the difference can be resolved into a problem about the right use of certain kinds of evidence. It would, of course, be ridiculous to expect that arguments in works on this subject should observe strictly the canons of Formal Logic; but we do require that some limit should be imposed upon the range of deviation from strict proof; and I feel from time to time that Mr. Cook, though far more conscious than many anthropologists of the weakness even of some of the arguments which evidently attract him most, is carried by his enthusiasm and his imagination beyond the legitimate limits; and he is so delightful a companion in these ven- tures, that there is a risk of others being carried with him, and the whole study of Ancient Religion being transplanted on to insecure foundations. I will give a few illustrations. I. The Use of Scientific or of Late Writers as Evidence of Early Popular Beliefs.-I doubt if Mr. Cook's use of Xenophanes (p. II), Heracleitus (p. 28), and Emnpedocles (p. 31) to support his theory that the worship of the sky itself left traces among the Hellenes is really justifiable. There is really nothing to show that the materialism of Xeno- phanes and his protest against the pre- valent anthropomorphic religion was NO. CCXLIX. VOL. XXIX. suggested by any lingering attraction towards such primitive cults, when e1S Tdv 6Xov ovbpavoY v cro3X*aro a b i ~v elval /ncrt Tov OeOv; and the statement that ' Xenophanes, like Pythagoras and many another reformer, starts with a revival of half-forgotten beliefs,' seems, like the similar statement about Herakleitos on p. 30, to be a petitiopyrincifii. (The case of Pythagoras is somewhat different.) To treat Herakleitos as evidence of popular belief is almost a paradox; it is very hard to believe that ' Herakleitos' cardinal doctrine of the universe as an Ever-living Fire is but a refinement upon the primitive conception of Zeus the Burning-Sky'; and the fragment quoted, avLiov  gJ pxirov o3pov alOptov Atdv, certainly does not imply that Zeus is thought of as the Bright Sky itself, rather than as the Lord of the Bright Sky. 'My neighbour's boundary' means the boundary of his land, but does not identify him with his garden. Nor can I think that Empedocles' availed himself of the belief that the fiery sky is Zeus'; and I am very doubtful whether the 'A'5p which Empedocles called Zeus was 'the fiery sky' at all, and not rather 'air.' I find the same difficulty in Mr. Cook's treatment of Ennius (p. io). Ennius wrote, 'Aspice hoc sublime candens, quem invocant omnes Iovem'; but surely the explanation is not that the Italians were just at this moment pass- ing from the cult of the sky to that of the Sky-god; but that Ennius was a follower of Euhemerus, or perhaps, in this passage, of Euripides (fr. 941) aP TOV i5VVoio 0 v8' a'rEtpov altpa; I Toirov VOFULe Zqva, Tdv7' ?oi V Oewv; and what Ennius represents is Greek rationalism-the very opposite of popu- lar belief. It seems indeed that to use literature which was certainly not popu- lar as evidence of popular belief is only legitimate if the writer quoted states that popular or primitive belief is de- scribed. Late literature generally needs the most careful handling, and above all the literature of times which were domi- nated by syncretistic tendencies. I can- not (e.g.) but look with great suspicion on the evidence from a Nestorian com- mentary on the Acts produced by Dr. Rendel Harris and several times quoted by Mr. Cook, for regarding the Cretan F</page><page sequence="3">82 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW Zeus as an Adonis-like personage killed by a wild boar, and annually revived-- a conception of the god which does not fit in well with other accounts of Cretan ideas about Zeus. The only explicit evidence for the belief in Zagreus as not merely the son of Zeus but Zeus re-born, is to be found in Nonnos. A good many points in Mr. Cook's argument turn on this passage, and they hardly seem sufficient to bear the weight of so much conjecture with regard to centuries so much earlier. Even writers like Apollo- dorus and Strabo, and conscious sys- tematisers generally, are not to be used without caution as evidence of actual beliefs at any given period; but I have not space to illustrate this point, which is, after all, obvious. 2. The Use of Works of A rt as Evidence of Cult or Belief.-Mr. Cook is very often both brilliant and convincing in this part of his work; but now and then questions suggest themselves. Does (e.g.) the use of symbols in representa- tions of the god imply that the god was once identical with the symbol ? If it does not do so universally, when does it do so ? Do the blue nimbus and blue globe connected with repre- sentations of Zeus really imply that he was once the Sky itself in popular belief ? Could they not be attached to him as god of the sky? Or again, is every group of dancing creatures (satyrs or what-not) on a vase, with a flute player in their midst, to be taken to represent an actual cult-dance ? or is it possible that, given the idea of satyrs, painters exercised their imagination and drew little scenes of this sort without direct dependence on ritual ? The interpreta- tion of the Pandora-krater and many other vases cannot be regarded as satis- factory until this question is answered one way or another. I do not feel sure that Mr. Cook is right in treating this as a representation of a satyric-play, though of course it illustates the fifth- century notion of the satyr. 3. The Use of Metaphors as Evidence. --I cannot believe that the poetical descriptions of the sun and moon as the eyes of Zeus show that 'the Greeks ... at one time regarded the sun and moon as the eyes of the animate sky' (p. I96), any more than the modern Peloponnesian Greeks whom Mr. Cook quotes.x 4. The Use of Modern Folk-Plays as Evidence.--Without going into details, I feel that we greatly need some prin- ciples here. At least it should be neces- sary to establish continuity in time between the ancient and the modern rite or performance, and, if the modern is used as evidence of the ancient Greek custom, to exclude the possibility of foreign influence. 5. The Use of Analogy.-Analogy is of course the principal weapon of the anthropologist; but it would be a great advantage if some principles with regard to its use were agreed upon. Mr. Cook sets an excellent example in his Preface, when he lays down 'that analogies taken from a contiguous area are more likely to be helpful than analogies gathered, sometimes on doubtful au- thority, from the ends of the habitable earth'; and of the former class of analogies he makes a very fruitful use. But now and then he seems to go beyond legitimate analogy. I very much doubt (e.g.) whether he proves that the wheel of Fortune is a solar- wheel (p. 268), and that it was a cult- utensil before it was a divine attribute. The use of the wheel as the symbol, not of the sun, but of instability, is attested by Pacuvius (ap. Rhet. ad Herenn. 2, 23, 36), who is probably working upon Greek material; and perhaps by Sopho- cles (fr. 787); and the rarity of the wheel on monuments perhaps suggests that it originated in poetry rather than in cult. Again, it seems hazardous to connect the Hekatoncheires and Cheiro- gastores with the solar symbol, the triskeles, on the ground that the many hands of the former are analogous to the three legs of the latter, even if there are some other slight grounds for the connection (p. 314). The analogy some- times depends on the principle that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another (cf. an argument on p. 247 and another on pp. 319, 320) ; and this principle rarely holds true in anthropology so far as it is 1 One of the strangest of Mr. Cook's iden- tifications-that of the Kyklops' eye with the sun-is partly based on the assertion here criticised.</page><page sequence="4">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 83 the record of beliefs as they were when living, rather than of identifications of cults by systematisers or in syncretistic worships; for to a systematiser at least a cult is often virtually a dead specimen, and syncretism has much of the sys- tematiser in its heart. Sometimes the analogy resolves itself simply into an ar- gument with an 'undistributed middle- term'-e.g., on p. 254, the Iynx-wheel had four spokes; the wheel of Ixion had four spokes; therefore the Iynx wheel = the wheel of Ixion, and therefore = the Sun. The argument which supports the identification of Zeus and Argos on the ground that both are called lHavodri is of the same class, but more risky, since the ground of the epithet was different in the two cases. It will doubtless be objected, in answer to my request for a Logic of the subject, that on my princi- ples so little could be taken as proved, and a great part of the work of some writers on Ancient Religion would be undone. "AvOpwor', a.atsp~ae, I/e rlvV orpayrtp&amp;av. This, I think, is true; and work which is based on conjectures, supported by other conjectures, and not on more or less clear principles of proof, had better be undone. But this, of course, does not apply to more than a fraction of Mr. Cook's work. Apart from these difficulties as to method, a few special points in this volume call for some remark. The treatment of the Kyklops legend leads to some strange results. The monster's one eye is identified with the shining orb of the sun, and the Kyklops is regarded as originally a Sky-god like Zeus; various legends are compared to prove his close connection with Zeus, and it is argued that the Kyklops was not only the maker, but originally the wielder and owner of the thunderbolt. The last point is certainly not proved by the monuments adduced (p. 319); and most of the arguments in which the Kyklops figures are somewhat uncon- vincing. The legend of the boring out of the Kyklops' eye is treated as parallel to the version of the Prometheus story which makes him get fire by applying a torch or reed to the wheel of the sun (though the story of Odysseus's exploit contains not the least hint of a desire to carry fire away); and both legends are explained as originating in a tale about the discovery of fire-sticks. This is at least very ingenious; but our suspicions are provoked by the linguistic argu- ments which follow, in which Prome- theus, who is said by Hesychius to have been called also Ithas or Ithax, is treated on that ground as closely parallel to Odysseus Ithakesios or Ithakos, while the name is also connected with a'80, atO97p, and the god of the Burning Sky. I have also great doubts about the infer- ence drawn from the title Promantheus, applied to Zeus at Thurii. (The reader will find many new and remarkable derivations in this book.) Mr. Cook revives Overbeck's theory that the worship of Zeus Ammon in the Oasis was established in the course of an early Greek expedition to Libya; he does not of course use certain argu- ments of Overbeck's which have long been discredited, but makes out a very strong case, comparing closely the oracular worships of the Oasis and of Dodona. It will be interesting to know what Sir Arthur Evans thinks of Mr. Cook's treatment of the Labyrinth and of Cretan matters generally; the argument ranges far, and whether conclusive or not, throws no little light on the sub- ject. The Labyrinth is regarded by Mr. Cook as a theatral area, marked out for an annual dance by the Mino- taur (in other words by the Crown Prince of Knossos in ritual costume, with a bull's head), representing the revolutions of the sun, conceived as a bull: the object of the dance was to promote the year's fruitfulness, by presenting the sun in his strength ful- filling his course and fertilising the earth. Whether Mr. Cook's explana- tion of the practice (so often depicted on early artistic remains) of taking the bull by the horns is correct, may perhaps be doubted. It is at least as likely that it was an effective trick in fighting (if employed with discretion), as that its object was to secure for the fighter the strength embodied in the horns. But, once more, we need a grammar of symbolism. The subject, perhaps, of most general interest with which Mr. Cook incident- ally deals is that of the Greek Drama.</page><page sequence="5">84 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW Here he reverses the ordinary account, according to which Tragedy was par- ticularly associated with the City Dio- nysia and Comedy with the Lenaea-an account which certainly seems to be true of the fifth century, in which the Tragedy of the Lenaea was compara- tively unimportant; and if the opposite was originally the case, we want to know what was the reason for the change. The fact that State-recognised competi- tions were organised for Comedy later than for Tragedy at the Dionysia also tells against the new theory. (Aris- totle Poet. V. 6'#e ror-e T l apXov 8oolcev naturally refers to the drrc'ovvu', and not to the 8faoixeX' who managed the Lenaea, and the very probable recon- struction of the great Dionysiac inscrip- tion [C.I.A. II. 971] by Capps and Wil- helm confirms the old view.) The Lenaea was doubtless the more primitive fes- tival, but this does not prove that it was the festival at which Tragedy originated; and if Mr. Cook makes out a strong case for the theory that the Lenaean ritual included the representa- tion of the Anodos of the Earth-mother with the infant Iacchus, and that (though this is much more doubtful) it also included a passion-play represent- ing the passion of Dionysus, he is still far from proving that it was this ritual and not some other, at first rustic but afterwards brought into the City Dio- nysia, which gave rise to Tragedy. As a matter of fact, the Schol. on Clement of Alexandria, whose remark (contain- ing at least one mistake, the association of Xkvatietv with the Xfvoo) is the only positive evidence for Mr. Cook's belief in a passion-play at the Lenaea, does not really prove more than that the verb Xqvaletvw was associated with a rustic song, 'including' (an ambiguous word, nrepteLxev, which may mean simply 'telling of') the acrraparyt6 of Dionysus; and if X^vat was a current name for Maenads, the song is not even, without further evidence, to be particularly associated with the Lenaea. Mr. Cook argues that his view that Tragedy originated at the Lenaea, Comedy at the City Dionysia, is con- firmed by the order in which the per- formances at the two festivals are mentioned in the Law of Euegoros (Dem. in Meid. ? Io) and in inscrip- tions-Tragedy before Comedy at the Lenaea, Comedy before Tragedy at the City Dionysia. He assumes (I) that the order of enumeration is the order of performance, and not of importance at the two festivals; (2) that the more primitive part of the festival was neces- sarily performed first. Both assump- tions are very doubtful. As to (I), the fact that the order of enumeration is different for the two festivals can be just as well explained by supposing that the order of importance was different- Tragedy being originally connected with the one festival, Comedy with the other-as by supposing that the order of performance was different; and he has to alter the text of Aristoph. A v. 787, in order to bring it into line with his view. Many scholars hold that Tragedy and Comedy were per- formed on the same day, as Aristo- phanes (unemended) implies-three Tragedies, a Satyric Play, and a Comedy on each day. If that were so, the order of enumeration in Laws and Inscriptions would, of course, not take the alterna- tion into account, but would naturally follow the order of importance, as generally accepted at the time. I suspect (though no proof is possible as regards the first two days) that the per- formances from Elaphebolion 10-14 were-on the Ioth, Boys' Choruses and one Comedy; IIth, Men's Choruses and one Comedy; 12th, I3th, I4th, 3 Tragedies, Satyric Play, and one Comedy. The other assumption (2) seems to be quite arbitrary, and with- out it Mr. Cook's argument fails. Ac- cretions might obviously either precede or follow the original performance. Mr. Cook believes that the dithyramb with which the City Dionysia opened represented the begetting of Dionysus (in accordance with his derivation of the word from the root -00p-), and pre- ceded the celebration of his birth at the Lenaea, quite properly, by ten lunar months, and supposes that, in Plato's statement that the subject of the dithyramb was the ryeve~s of the god, 7EveTr includes ryevvflon. It may be doubted whether he does not restrict the original theme of the dithyramb too closely; and his next paragraph only</page><page sequence="6">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 85 proves that phallic ritual was performed at the City Dionysia, not that Comedy originated from this particular phallic ritual. It may well have come to be attached to such ritual; but I believe that the evidence of Dorian origin is too strong to be explained away. The sug- gestion on p. 733. that the wedding of Zeus and Semele (and the begetting of Dionysus) were represented at the Pandia, with which the Dionysia ter- minated, is very inadequately proved. Mr. Cook then proceeds to argue that, like the City Dionysia and the Lenaea, the Anthesteria and the Rural Dionysia respectively centred upon the begetting and the birth of Dionysus, with a ten months' interval between them. The arguments are wonderfully ingenious, but very hazardous. Among the chief difficulties are his (to me) very improbable interpretation of the picture of the Rural Dionysia given in the A charnians, and the apparent fact that the ten months' interval was not constant. Dr. Farnell (Cults, V. zo6) gives some reason for thinking that (e.g.) at Icaria the Rural Dionysia took place in the spring; and the date of the festival certainly varied in different places (cf. Haigh, Attic Theatre, ed. 3, p. 29). Further, Mr. Cook suggests that if the Lenaean drama was the true parent of Attic Tragedy, it was presumably followed by a satyric display. He adds in a note that 'this is not definitely recorded, but our records are very in- complete.' But the inscriptional record of Lenaean Tragedies for the years 420/19, 419/8 (C.I.A. II. 972), though mutilated, shows quite clearly that in those years at any rate there was no satyric play attached to the tragedies represented by the two competing poets; for the inscription allows no room for the mention of anything more than the tragedies. What little evidence there is is thus distinctly against the sug- gestion made. Mr. Cook's suggestion that satyr- dances may not have been originally Dionysiac, but may have attached themselves to the cult of any fertility power, and to Dionysus among others, is very attractive, because it avoids the derivation of Tragedy directly from satyric play-a derivation made very difficult by the immense difference in tone between the two. I do not gather whether he thinks that the chorus of Thespis were dressed as T7p6yot: I doubt whether they were; but certainly no authority ascribes satyr-plays or a satyr-chorus to Thespis. I have ventured to criticise a good many of Mr. Cook's arguments, from no love of controversy, which I detest, but solely because I think that he has not yet found the solution of some of the difficulties which must be got over before we can be at all sure that we are near the truth about the Greek Drama. At present, I frankly do not believe that the evidence is sufficient to enable us to decide many of the questions we should like to ask; but that is no reason for accepting any answers that are not sufficiently grounded. I should like to conclude, as I began, with an expression of sincere gratitude to Mr. Cook for his exhaustive and illuminat- ing treatise. A. W. PICKARD-CAMBRIDGE.</page></plain_text>
