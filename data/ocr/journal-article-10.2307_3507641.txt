<plain_text><page sequence="1">362 Reviews Psychoanalysis and Fiction: An Exploration of Literary and Psychoanalytic Borders. By DANIEL GUNN. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 1988. xi + 251 PP- ?25.00. Art and Desire: A Study in the Aesthetics of Fiction. By BRIAN ROSEBURY. London: Macmillan. 1988. xvi + 266 pp. ?29-50. Ranging into psychoanalysis and aesthetics, these works are most interestingly characterized by their subtitles: 'exploration', 'study'. Both are ambitious and serious. Their fields of literary reference are comparably extensive, though one includes more 'world greats' (Dante, Kafka, Proust, Beckett, amongst them), while the other concentrates on nineteenth-century English literature, enlivened occasion- ally by excursions into great music. Their critical and theoretical precursors are of course different. Freud, Lacan, and a more recent psychiatrist, Maud Mannoni, make something of a familiar compound ghost for one. Lukacs, Leavis, Richards (Saussure and Lodge perhaps) are the principal antagonists to the other. The first is an essay in comparativism, offered breezily to sympathetic minds, moving between theory and analysis, between disciplines, between biography and fiction, encourag- ing speculation. The second is essentially an exhortation to us, in the 'profession', culminating in an 'Appendix: The Justification of Criticism'. Its tone is magisterial, its procedures adversarial, answering a number of notional objections before indulging in any positive appreciation. There is a stern purpose quite at odds with the enticement of its title: Art and Desire, as if such frivolities must be controlled. To read these two books in sequence produces curious effects: interest, quizzicality, exasperation, and enjoyment; then relief at methodical procedures, which however gives way to some resentment. Theoretician as hang-glider, or critic as footsoldier? What are they about, and for whom? My observations may be impertinent, but the questions are not, for both these studies clearly venture beyond the matter of the text, and propose as part of their subject the psychology of the reader, the depths of subconscious energy which may be touched, released, or governed by the work of art. Daniel Gunn acknowledges this not only theoretically but in practice, by openly using the first person pronoun in his discussion, and by exploring both literature and psychoanalysis in terms of complex processes involving interaction, transference, and a necessary separation too between participants. In recounting Maud Mannoni's case 'Guy ou la mort du pere', he not only draws analogies with Hamlet and with the tensions of life and art for Kafka, but also (in modest parentheses) points out that 'as my own father died when I was Guy's age, there may well be more to my apparently random choice of him than I first realised'. The phrasing, as well as the fact, of this confession, works: in marked contrast to the abstract terminology of Brian Rosebury's 'further appeal to common experience, or rather, to introspection'. In essence, the appeal is the same, and it is vital to the argument of both works, since they depend on the notion of shared psychological experience. But in form, in tone, in effect, one offers confession: the other direction, and a stylistic authority inherently inappropriate to the move- ment of ideas. Language, as an exorcism, a vehicle, or metaphor for desire, could be seen as the common denominator of these books, so different in tone, yet working over such close ground. Language, that is, in an extended sense; for Daniel Gunn is concerned with larger patterns of 'repetition and return' as expressions of ambivalence, while Brian Rosebury explicitly rejects the Saussurian model of linguistics for literary texts, though he uses in his own analysis features of structure including plot and characterization, imagery and symbolism, and narrative patterning which a for- malist might organize through quasi-linguistic codes. What sets the two books apart, however, is their understanding of the relationship between language and</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 363 desire. Daniel Gunn follows Lacan in positing a divide between the imaginary and symbolic, of which language belongs to the second, and thus signals separation, loss, and longing. There may be problems with the post-Freudian phallocentrism of this theory, but so long as the element of metaphor in its expression is recognized, it provides a way of looking at the relationship between undifferentiated feeling and communicable form. Brian Rosebury holds that Lacanian desire is 'not our present purpose', though it is not clear why: he too wants to explore 'the experiential shortfall between imagining and having'. In describing desire, Rosebury is con- strained to appeal to 'common experience', 'common sense', and to such normative assertions as rest upon these notions. But when he writes 'In the first place art produces lucid, concentrated desire out of the somewhat indistinct and fitful discontents which normally comprise our hour-by-hour mental life', a rhythm of disruption militates uncomfortably against the vocabulary of authority. Again, in recapitulating the argument, an ugly locution betrays some unease over 'the arousal of desires (or aversions, which are simply desires with a negative added)'. This may be mathemetically plausible, but the contradiction sounds out a warning tone: a signal perhaps of ambivalence, yoked love and hate, for the very idea of desire. Something of this contrariness governs the procedures of the work. First Brian Rosebury sets out to dismiss alternative approaches to literary criticism, conceived as opponents to his aesthetics. Historical realism, moral realism, linguistics, are exposed through extracts from celebrated proponents; then possible objections to his preferred argument are mooted. Only after all this negative display do we find the proffered analysis of Wuthering Heights, designed to illustrate how art stirs our latent desires, yet controls their force, leaving us disquieted. By now, however, the superstructure of theory overshadows the attempt, and it is not easy to retain, through this reading, those appetencies which Rosebury claims we all share. Such feelings are simply left unspoken by critical language such as this: 'This last anthropomorphism alerts the reader (not necessarily at a fully conscious level) to the association, partially causative, which is being established between climatic and domestic states. A slightly later passage confirms the association, internalising the tempest in a literal as well as a figurative sense.' The difference between this earnest endeavour and Daniel Gunn's work is that the latter can better accommodate disruption. His whole case is no more than an analogy, and this becomes its strength. For ultimately the argument suggests that in literature as in psychoanalysis the reader is working at one remove, attempting to discover himself by way of a text whose discoveries are already there. The notions of beginning and end are interchanged, and the processes of interaction involve quietness as well as utterance: 'One is less an impersonal or impartial intelligence than an intensely personal voice.' This avowal carries more weight than assumed indifference, and leaves more space for our own responses. UNIVERSITY OF READING NICOLA BRADBURY</page></plain_text>
