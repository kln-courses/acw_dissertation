<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ejumba: The Iconography of the Diola Initiation Mask By Peter Mark YC7 our work is very interesting, but isn't it really anthropology?" Art historians working with African art are often confronted with this question. The frequency with which this and related questions are posed suggests that it is important for Africanists to demon- strate what to us may seem obvious: that our methodology is, indeed, properly art historical.1 It is in the area of iconographic analy- sis, or more precisely the contextual interpretation of symbolic form and meaning, that the label of "anthropolo- gy" is most readily applied to the work of African art historians. If there is a perceived distinction between the study of Western and African art, it reflects the difference between the study of liter- ate and nonliterate cultures. I would, however, argue that the methodology employed to study both cultures is essen- tially the same. Only the nature of the sources available to the scholar varies. Whereas the student of Western, and particularly Christian, art deals with written sources and with the artistic interpretation of written word by visual image, Africanists-with exceptions, found largely in Muslim regions-must rely on nonwritten sources. These include oral traditions, informal oral narratives, and, above all, observation and analysis of the rituals of which the art is a part, and comparison with other, related works whose symbolic meaning is perhaps more accessible. Ultimately, however, both art histori- ans who study Africa and those who study literate cultures are pursuing a contextual interpretation of their re- spective societies. Furthermore, the reliance on nonwritten information is not peculiar to Africanists. Panofsky expressed the need to consult as broad a spectrum as possible of cultural docu- ments: The art historian will have to check what he thinks is the intrin- sic meaning of the work, or group of works, to which he devotes his attention, against what he thinks is the intrinsic meaning of as many other documents of civilization historically related to that work or group of works, as he can master: of documents bearing witness to the political, poetical, religious, philosophical, and social tenden- cies of the personality, period or country under investigation.2 One must, of course, accept that "docu- ments" may be nonwritten, even nonver- bal in form. To limit the definition of "documents" to writing is to endorse a classification of literate and nonliterate civilizations that maintains the paradig- matic analogy: art history is to the art of literate cultures as anthropology is to the art of nonliterate cultures. Such a distinction is, in its ethnocentrism, unac- ceptable. A methodological caveat is, however, in order for those of us who do use nonwritten sources. These sources are often unique and nonreproduceable occurrences such as prayer rituals. Con- sequently, colleagues may be unable to test the validity of our observations. The use of such nonwritten documents thus imposes special obligations on the researcher. The temptation to "reinter- pret" data and "clean it up" in the very process of recording it has to be resisted. Equally important, discussions of sym- bolic meaning in a group of artworks or ritual symbols must be tied to a care- fully and narrowly defined geographical and cultural-linguistic area, sometimes even to a single community. This will help us to avoid the inaccuracies that come from gross generalization and from the mixing of sources that come from two or more distinct societies. In the pages that follow, I present a case study, a contextual interpretation of a single class of objects: the cattle- horned circumcision/initiation mask, ejumba (Fig. 1), of the Diola people of southwestern Senegal (see map). The interpretation of this woven-fiber mask, of its form, and of its decorative ele- ments derives from four sources: local oral traditions; informal discussions with adults who have gone through the initiation; analysis of those parts of the ritual that are accessible to the outside observer; and, where iconographic ele- ments are shared by the ejumba and other ritual objects whose function is known, comparison of those decorative elements. Then, when the esoteric func- tion of the mask itself became known, I was able to check the accuracy of the iconographic interpretation derived from these four sources against the secret role of the mask. Diola Society and Ritual The Diola are the largest ethnolinguistic group in the Lower Casamance. Num- bering about 250,000 they are primarily wet-rice farmers. Using a complex sys- tem of dikes and drainage ditches, they reclaim fertile land from the salt-water Fig. 1 Ejumba mask, collected in 1886. Berlin, Museum fur V6lkerkunde. Summer 1988 139</page><page sequence="2">tidal streams that crisscross the Lower Casamance. Diola society is essentially egalitar- ian. There are no castes, although the Diedhiu or blacksmiths have separate status, and there is no rigid social strati- fication. Before the colonial period, the extended-family housing compound was the basis of social organization. Diola villages, composed of semi-autonomous quarters, number from a few hundred to several thousand inhabitants. At the village level, community deci- sions are traditionally made by councils of elders, with women having a signifi- cant voice in questions pertaining to religious ritual, at least before the spread of Islam. Residence is patrilocal and descent is usually bilateral. Before Islamization of the northern Diola, each extended family maintained a shrine, called, depending on the region, bekin or enaati. Many shrines took the form of uncarved, forked stakes stuck into the earth, but prominent natural objects, especially large silk-cotton trees, also served as shrines. The bekin was the locus for palm-wine libations, animal sacrifices, and attendant prayers. Likewise, the village had its sacred forest and attendant shrine, both of which played important roles in the vil- lage-wide men's initiation ceremony, bukut. Bukut is still celebrated, once a generation, in each Diola village. The people who now refer to them- selves as "Diola" are actually far from homogeneous. Religious rituals differ sig- nificantly, even from one community to the next. There is tremendous dialectical diversity and the different dialects are not always mutually comprehensible.3 Today, a large majority of the people of Fogny and Buluf are Muslims. Diola society first came under the influence of Islamic marabouts about 1890. The pro- cess of Islamization, associated with urban migration and the spread of a cash economy,4 accelerated among the Diola living north of the Casamance River after about 1920. Today, about 90 percent of the northern Diola are Mus- lims. Many indigenous shrines have been abandoned and community-wide religious rituals have been altered. Yet the bukut initiation survives, even in thoroughly Muslim villages. In Kasa, by contrast, there are few Muslims. Chris- tian missionary activity there dates to the 1880s, and a substantial portion of the southern Diola-as well as their neighbors in northern Guine-Bissau- are Catholics. In Kasa, however, and particularly in Guine, local Diola reli- gion remains far more pervasive than among the northern Diola. These regional variations are not exclusively a result of the colonial peri- Fig. 2 Usikoi, danced at the bukut in the village of Bagaya, in Buluf, 1975. Fig. 3 Ejumba mask, collected in 1886. Leiden, Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde. od. Diola society has long been charac- terized by regional diversity. Any gener- alizations derived from specific Diola subgroups must, therefore, be ap- proached with caution. For this reason, in studying the cattle-horned initiation masks, I have taken pains to balance detailed field work in one region- Buluf-with additional field work in several parts of Kasa and Fogny, and in Guine. Where terminology and even the ritual function of the masks may be peculiar to a particular group of villages, I have indicated the region from which specific information comes. Diola cattle-horned headdresses are divided into two main types. There is a short cap, usually referred to simply as erofey (Fr: "le bonnet") or as usikoi (from usin: "horns") (Fig. 2). There is also the true helmet mask, called ejumba in Buluf, which covers the entire head. In parts of Kasa, both the mask and the cap are referred to as usikoi. In this paper, however, ejumba is used to refer to the mask, while usikoi refers to the horned cap. Where they are found-and neither form of headdress is danced by all of the Diola-the horned mask and the cap are an integral part of the bukut initiation ceremony. Ejumba and usikoi are both widespread, and both are found north and south of the Casamance River. In large measure, the ejumba and usikoi are accouterments of the dance. To ignore the percussive rhythms of the attendant drumming, the often acro- batic bodily movement of the dancers, and the hand-clapping participation of the entire community would be to isolate the masks and caps from the very con- text that gives them meaning. Dance is also the source of the vibrant energy that brings the cattle-horned headdresses to life. The ejumba are worn as helmet masks; the dancer looks through the tubular eye holes of the mask (Fig. 3). With the original raffia fringes at- tached, ejumba cover the initiate to his feet, effectively hiding his identity. The restricted field of vision and the acro- batic gestures expected of ejumba danc- ers mean that the individual who wears this mask has to be an accomplished, athletic dancer. Bukut The ejumba are intimately bound up with the men's initiation ceremony, bukut. Bukut is the most important ritual occasion in Diola society; indeed, one could almost define the Diola as those people who celebrate the bukut. An adult male is, by definition, one who has experienced bukut. Bukut follows the same general pattern, although with local variations, everywhere in the Lower Casamance. Celebrated at inter- vals of twenty or more years, the initia- tion is preceded by months of prepara- tion, some public and some secret. The bukut itself begins with three days of public celebration, crowned by dancing and communal feasting at which huge quantities of rice and beef, representing decades' accumulation of wealth, are consumed. The father of each initiate provides an animal to be sacrificed in honor of his son. Traditionally, only men who had completed the bukut had the right to marry or to go to war. Bukut thus marks the maturity of the entire 140 Art Journal</page><page sequence="3">generation whose members are initiated together. The central events of bukut are the circumcision-in Muslim communities the initiates have usually already been circumcised, and only a cicatrization is performed-and the initiation retreat that follows. The retreat, in the commu- nity's sacred forest, is run by elders from the village or by relatives from sur- rounding communities. Discipline is strict, and each initiate is instructed in traditions, sexual information, a secret language, and general rules of comport- ment. Information learned in the sacred forest is secret. During the celebration that precedes the "cutting" (futamp) and the initia- tion retreat, visitors from all of Senegal participate in dancing and feasting. Older men dance while demonstrating their courage by sawing at their own necks with sharp knives. Others dance while firing ancient trade muskets, set- ting off clouds of smoke that are "cho- reographed" into the dance. Finally, the initiates, festooned in raffia skirts, many of them wearing horned caps, are led into the sacred forest. They remain there for about a month, although for- merly the retreat lasted as long as three months. In the forest, discipline is harsh, to teach respect for authority. The diet is limited to rice, some dried fish, and palm oil-to help the scars heal. As the end of the retreat approaches, the ini- tiates are instructed in the fabrication of special clothing made of the bark of baobab trees and palm fronds that will disguise their identity when they make their public exit from the forest.5 For three days preceding the exit from the forest, there is public dancing, and the fathers send additional clothing for their sons to wear. On the day of the exit, each initiate makes his return to the community by performing an indi- vidual dance. During this dance, some of the initiates wear the full-faced ejumba mask. The cattle-horned masks are the most impressive manifestation of visual art found in the Casamance. It is, therefore, not surprising that from the time the French established themselves in the region, in the second half of the nine- teenth century, they began to collect ejumba masks. At least ten masks from before 1900 are in European and Ameri- can museums (Fig. 4). The earliest detailed description of the masks in Diola initiation ceremonies also dates from this period. In 1900, Lasnet wrote: When they have all recovered, the initiates make their solemn return to the villages. [T]hey wear fiber helmets that descend to their shoulders, with two projections at eye level, ornamented with red seeds and surmounted by two cat- tle horns; a long fringe made of strands of baobab bark follows them and reaches to the waist; to their robe are attached charms and long strands analogous to that of the helmet and which descend all the way to their feet; they carry in their hands a stick of white wood, about 1.2 meters long, topped by a plume, quite straight, of palm leaves. The less fortunate have no helmet.6 Lasnet's description is of considerable importance, both because it so clearly indicates that the role of the masks has not changed significantly since the late nineteenth century and because it pro- vides the earliest indisputable documen- tation of ejumba masks among the Diola. Unfortunately, this passage re- mained unknown to three generations of museum curators, who repeatedly and incorrectly ascribed Diola ejumba masks to the Bijogo, the Balante, and the Manding. Ejumba: Form and Iconography How accessible are Diola circumcision masks to an iconographic interpreta- tion? How does the dominant bovine symbolism relate to the bukut initia- tion? Do the selection and arrangement of decorative elements offer insight into the ritual meaning of the masks? The social function of the masks and their symbolic meaning reveal them- selves only if the art historian under- Fig. 4 Fragmentary ejumba (missing horns), collected between 1894 and 1914. Bordeaux, Musee d'Ethnologie. stands the Diolas' ritual world. This world includes important metaphysical concepts and linguistic metaphors that are part of peoples' lives in the Lower Casamance. Again, one has to know the cultural context. Diola culture, which was nonliterate, is recorded in spoken language, in song, and in ritual. Bovine imagery is the central element in the symbolic meaning of the ejumba. The masks-ambiguously part animal and part anthropomorphic-are the embodiment of the masculine virtues prized by the Diola, among whom cattle are associated with men's social and economic status. To the Diola, cattle represent an important form of wealth. Large herds are the equivalent of the Westerner's large bank account,7 and ownership of cattle is one of the mea- sures of a man's social standing. The association of cattle with wealth is not a recent tradition. Large herds were observed in the Casamance as chroni- cled by Valentim Fernandes in 1506,8 and subsequent European visitors also mentioned cattle in their discussions of the Casamance. Today, as in the past, cattle are con- sumed only as part of important ritual sacrifices that accompany marriages, funerals of wealthy men, and the bukut. After the sacrifice, the animal's horns are frequently preserved. The very name of the short initiation headdress-in Diola, usikoi derives from usin, "horns"-demonstrates the central iconographic role of the bovine imagery. It should also be recalled that some Diola use usikoi as a generic term referring to both horned cap and horned mask. The Diola sacrifice large numbers of cattle at only two rituals: the men's initiation and funerals. At funerals of wealthy men, horns of sacrificial ani- mals were used to decorate the housing compound of the deceased, as a sign of his wealth and as exhortation to the survivors to follow in his virtuous and materially rewarding footsteps.9 In the bukut, too, cattle, immolated in the ini- tiates' honor, serve as a sign of wealth. On the masks, as in the funeral cere- monies, the horns undoubtedly serve to exhort the younger generation to follow the hard-working example of their elders. At traditional funerals cattle horns had a second function; they were asso- ciated with witch-finding. The funeral bier, decorated with horns, was borne around the village. If witchcraft was suspected in the death, the corpse would lead the bearers to the guilty party.10 This association suggests the possibili- ty-to which I shall return-that the initiation masks, too, may have been Summer 1988 141</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 5 "Vaca bruto," Bijogos.

After all, when attached to the bull, horns are a formidable weapon, although they are more frequently used for defense than for attack. This, too, however, relates to the symbolic role of the ejumba. For the horned mask specif- ically evokes defensive strength. In addition, cattle horns refer to sex- ual power. Virility is an appropriate subject for the bukut, since Diola men were traditionally not permitted to marry until after they had undergone the ritual circumcision. Until the colo- nial period, many individuals were past thirty before they could go through the bukut. The initiation was thus a rather belated rite of passage. With its sexual connotations, the Diola horned mask recalls the "wild bull" (Fig. 5) of the Bijogos people. The Bijogos' far more naturalistic wooden initiation mask, which is probably distantly related to the ejumba, sometimes participates in explicit sexual pantomine."1 Throughout the Lower Casamance and coastal Guine-Bissau, cattle-horned masks stand for the physical prowess and sex- ual potency associated with young men. Often, the show of strength takes the form of athletic dance competitions.12 Among the neighboring people of Guine-Bissau, horned masks also sym- bolize masculine aggressiveness and power. One of Hugo Bernatzik's photo- graphs of an initiation among the Bal- ante, published in 1933, shows a compe- tition in which masked initiates seem to be fighting with their horns.13 Likewise among the Bijogos, Augusto Santos Lima observed the central role of bovine masks as symbols of unbridled force,14 and Danielle Gallois Duquette describes the aggressive dancing movements of the "wild bull" initiation mask.'5 Diola ejumba, unlike the carved masks of the Bijogos, are an abstract amalgam of bovine and human ele- ments: the broad forehead and horns are bovine, but the general shape of the mask retains human characteristics, as does the placement of the tubular eyes. The eyes, dark and protruding, are themselves neither properly anthropo- morphic nor bovine. The material, a tightly woven palm fiber, limits the shapes available to the artist; this explains the predominance of cylindrical and tubular forms. At the same time, the simplified geometrical shapes add to the effect of the mask (Fig. 6). Thus the mask is ambiguously part-animal and part-human. Its bivalence is appropri- ate, given that the initiates are in a liminal stage between childhood and adulthood. The ejumba is not only more effective than the short usikoi at main- taining the dancer's anonymity; it, unlike the cap, echoes the initiate's tran- sitional state. Ejumba: Decorative Elements Diola masks are decorated with a vari- ety of materials (Fig. 7) including Abrus precatorius seeds, shells, strips of palm fronds cut into diamond patterns, and a cut-pile raffia fringe that usually runs down the center of the mask. Some ejumba also are adorned with small mirrors, buttons, and pieces of cloth. All these elements, except the fringe, are attached to the basketry core by a res- inous substance, which informants iden- tify as a variety of latex.16 The decorative elements are chosen for their symbolic meaning. That sym- bolism is shared with a wide range of other Diola ritual objects, clothing, and utilitarian implements, including war- riors' helmets, ceremonial dance shields, and rattles belonging to the women's society, kanyalen. This wide range of objects demonstrates a remarkably con- sistent iconography. Often, a particular decorative element has the same sym- bolic references everywhere that it appears. By looking at the range of other objects, it is thus possible to elucidate the iconography of the ejumba. The red Abrus seeds and the shells are an important element of the ejumba. Horned masks decorated with seeds are documented in the Casamance since the late seventeenth century.'7 Red is asso- ciated with blood and with aggressive force. This connection is corroborated by the appearance of seeds and shells on warriors' helmets. In 1862 a French officer, Lieutenant A. Vallon, who had recently faced the Diola in battle, wrote, "The people of Djougoutes [Buluf] use as defensive weapons a helmet deco- rated with shells and red seeds."'8 Not one of these helmets has survived, but they must have been similar to the ini- tiation masks, except for the absence of horns and tubular eyeholes. In addition to their association with warriors, shells served as emblems of wealth. Until the end of the nineteenth century, cowries were used by the Diola as a form of currency. On the masks they probably alluded to the wealth that the initiates could hope to attain if they would follow the strictures taught them during the initiation retreat. That cowries also appear on the regalia of the women's kanyalen society may indicate that they were fertility references as well. This organization, whose members have had difficulty giv- ing birth to healthy children, helps the women to bear and raise healthy off- spring. Members of kanyalen appear at public ceremonies with distinctive rega- lia, including a cowrie-encrusted dance rattle. In some ejumba, cowries are replaced by bivalves. This recalls the use of such shells in traditional rain prayers, where the shells help to ensure abundant rain- fall.19 The theme of fertility, here shifted from the human to the agricultural realm, remains the point of reference. Seeds and shells thus allude to aggres- sive strength, wealth, and fertility. The multivocality of ritual symbols is not uncommon and it has been thoroughly discussed in anthropological literature. In the ejumba, the multiple allusions of the decorative elements add richness to the mask's meaning. The association of red Abrus seeds with aggressive power is confirmed by Fig. 6 Ejumba mask, collected before 1951.

This shield, called ebanken (from kaben, "to protect") (Fig. 8), was an assemblage of glyphs of power.21 Ebanken shields were deco- rated with Abrus seeds, cowries, but- tons, and shards of broken mirror. The ebanken protected its owner against the assaults of the kussay, or cannibal- witches. Like many other African peoples, the Diola perceive a universe that is not bifurcated into physical and spiritual realms. Rather, what Westerners would see as two separate spheres the Diola see as a continuum; the daily world is con- stantly impinged upon and affected by forces from the invisible world. This is clearly expressed by the Diola con- ception of the kussay. The kussay are people who have the ability to transform themselves into malevolent forces at night, when they take on the physical form of animal familiars. In this guise they hold nocturnal feasts at which they partake of the life-force (or soul) of human victims. This causes the victims to fall ill and even to die. Significantly, the Diola do not distinguish this canni- balism of a person's life-force from actual physical anthropophagy. In Diola society much misfortune, including ill- ness and death, is attributed to the kus- say. The kussay were considered an ever- present danger. They are still feared and respected, even by Muslim Diola. Mus- lims today have access to a range of antiwitchcraft defenses, some clearly of local, Diola origin. The ebanken is now rarely used. Before about 1920, how- ever, the shield played an important role in the life-and-death struggle against the kussay by increasing the protective forces within the village. In this struggle, human beings also relied heavily on a group of men who had the inherited ability to locate witches and to engage and kill them in aerial combat. The Diola refer to these beneficent beings in French as les tetes clairvoyantes or, in Diola, as bukan bujak ("good people"), or as kuto- koherit bukan ("they never munch people up"). The ebanken shield was associated with the same constellation of antiwitchcraft forces that were personi- fied in the kutokoherit bukan. Interestingly, the same decorative elements found on the ebanken shield also figure on the ejumba masks. In both contexts the red seeds refer to blood and symbolize protective power. The ebanken shields the warrior from the power of the kussay, just as his helmet shields him from enemy blows, and just as the seed-covered ejumba protects the new initiate. And on the shield, jagged shards of mirror, suggestive of cutting and tearing, help to drive away the kussay. Mirrors are said to unmask and reveal witches, who, seeing their true nefarious nature reflected in the glass, must either flee or die.22 Antiwitchcraft forces are often metaphorically described by refer- ence to the image of seeing in the night. Thus, the clairvoyant kutokoherit bu- kan are described as people with beams of light issuing from atop their heads. These beacons track down witches. Illu- mination and clarity of vision are meta- phors for antiwitchcraft activity that extend to the mirrors that decorate some ejumba. Although not all ejumba masks include mirrors, three examples in the IFAN Museum in Dakar, one in the Afrika-Museum in Berg-en-Dal, and one in the Museum Haus Volker und Kulturen, in St. Augustin near Bonn are embellished with small round mirrors (Fig. 9), providing them metaphorically with extra eyes that focus on the invisi- ble world of the night. Buttons are a nineteenth-century addition to the decorative program of the ebanken shield. Buttons first became readily available to the Diola as trade items and as part of imported clothing in 1838 when the French established a commercial post at Carabane near the mouth of the Casamance River. By the second half of the century, the people of Buluf were engaged in trade with the French, and goods of European manu- Fig. 8 Ebanken shield, c. 1920; photographed in Buluf in 1984. facture had become a sign of prosperity to the Diola. To include buttons on the dance shield as a symbol of wealth and power-the wealthy man being also a powerful individual in his society-was to incorporate modern trade goods into the traditional iconographic scheme of the ebanken. As a sign of wealth, but- tons were comparable to cowries. In one instance, buttons also appear on an initiation mask, the impressive ejumba now in the Musee Municipal d'Angouleme (Fig. 10). This piece was probably collected at the beginning of the twentieth century. Its fine crafts- manship reflects the relatively early date. Here, buttons join the more tradi- tional shells as symbols of wealth. As ftH,D Fig. 9 Ejumba mask, from the 1965 bukut at Niomoune. Berg-en-dal, Afrika-Museum. Summer 1988 143</page><page sequence="6">new products became available, they were readily assimilated into the exist- ing vocabulary. These new decorative elements, too, had a symbolic meaning that related directly to the function of the masks. Most of the materials chosen to embellish the ejumba and ebanken had distinct symbolic meaning; indeed, these decorative elements often had multiple interpretations. In the broadest sense they relate to wealth and power, power that protects against the forces of the invisible world.23 In addition, the mate- rials that were used to decorate the initiation mask referred to ideals of manhood that the initiates were encour- aged to strive to achieve. There is thus an underlying didactic element, even a moral quality to the initiation masks. Other historians of African art, includ- ing Philip Ravenhill among the Baule and Robert Thompson among the Yoru- ba, have suggested that an African aes- thetic necessarily incorporates the moral concepts and the ideals of conduct of the culture that has created the work of art.24 This is certainly true in the Casa- mance. Among the Diola, the selection of materials-horns, seeds, cowries, mirrors, buttons-reflects societal ide- als of conduct. This is not to say that every member of the society is aware of the symbolic meaning of each compo- nent of the mask. But from a Diola perspective, the most accomplished and the most fully realized of the ejumba successfully integrate the aesthetic with the moral. The Impact of Islam on the Ejumba Since about 1930, Islam has attracted a majority of the northern Diola. In Buluf, 90 percent of the population is now Muslim. Traditional rituals have been significantly affected and, although the bukut is still celebrated, the ebanken shield is no longer used. The ejumba, too, have become far less common. At the bukut, the masks are now frequently replaced by the simpler, cap-like usi- koi. In a large community in Buluf, Esu- key,25 many adults who were initiated at the most recent bukut, in 1962, could not recall ever having seen ejumba. Older informants, who had been ini- tiated in 1919 or 1940, were familiar with the ejumba, however, and some had even danced the mask. But they, too, could not recall seeing any of the masks in 1962. Chronologically, the decline of the ejumba in Esukey closely coincides with the spread of Islam. Is this decline and the replacement of the mask by the usikoi to be attributed to the impact of Islam? Why should the mask, but not Fig. 10 Ejumba mask, collected before 1934 (probably c. 1900). Angouleme, Musee Municipal. the horned cap, have been so affected? Could the ejumba have had another, more esoteric function that was some- how incompatible with Islam? Informants denied any difference in ritual function or symbolic meaning between the ejumba and the usikoi. This seemed to confirm scholarly opin- ion.26 But there were indications that the mask and the cap might not be identical in function. The decorative elements found in the ejumba are more varied than those used to decorate the usikoi, and they are precisely the materials found on nineteenth-century warriors' helmets and on antiwitchcraft shields. It is unlikely that the use of such a vocabu- lary of protective power could have been merely coincidental. Also, whereas the usikoi can be readily photographed and even purchased in every community in which I carried out field work, the ejumba are difficult to find, let alone photograph, and they are never for sale.27 At times, I had the clear sense that informants were trying to prevent me from seeing an ejumba. These circumstances suggest that the ejumba may be a highly prized, even sacred object, one not generally placed on public display and certainly not shown to outsiders. Envoi Upon my recent return to Esukey, where I first lived in 1974-75, I was met by Apalom, a friend whose late father, one of the last non-Muslims in the village, had been my most important informant on traditional shrines and rituals. It was the old man who had first explained to me about the kutokoherit bukan, who protected the community against witches. When his son invited me to "greet" the family shrine, I could barely control my excitement. In five visits, this was the first time I had been able to document the survival of important in- digenous shrines in this Muslim environ- ment. The libation and prayer ritual was a moving experience. Apalom greeted by name generations of ancestors from whom he has inherited guardianship of the shrine. But the importance of that shrine is now greatly reduced; in another generation, many of the traditions it represents will be only a memory. Many of those traditions are now preserved in the book and articles that I have pub- lished. Since my friend is anxious that the rituals of his own ancestors not be forgotten, I have in a sense become an actor in the drama, chronicling the decline-and possible preservation-of local traditions. Later, we discussed the horned ini- tiation masks. Apalom asked whether I understood the difference between the function of the ejumba mask and the usikoi. The masks did, indeed, have separate roles. Any initiate could dance wearing the horned cap, even before the retreat in the sacred forest. But the full-faced mask appeared only after the initiates had left the forest. Furthermore, at each bukut, of the en- tire generation of initiates only two or three men were entitled to make and wear the ejumba. The masks could be worn only by young men who had been born with "clairvoyance," that is, the future kuto- koherit bukan.28 My friend's father and his father before him had worn the mask. Had Apalom not become a Mus- lim along with the rest of the village, he too would have worn the ejumba. The secrecy associated with the kuto- konierit bukan, together with the fact that no new ones have been selected in Mus- lim communities since about 1940, makes it difficult to learn how these individuals were chosen. Clairvoyance was usually inherited. Thus, the son of one who had worn an ejumba was likely to be named to dance the mask himself. The person se- lected had to be an excellent dancer. To provide him with added strength and en- durance, he was given special medica- tions.29 Some informants maintain that the particular bark (bohanken) used to make the mask's fiber fringe would itself make the wearer drunk.30 Certainly some chemical stimulants were administered, but the excitement and honor of being selected to wear the ejumba quite likely served as a natural stimulant to the dancer. The ejumba were far more than a representation of the masculine virtues and norms of conduct taught to initiates during the bukut. They embodied the supernatural powers-granted to but a small number of individuals-that were a critical defense against witchcraft. This explains the similarity in symbol- ism between the masks and the ebanken shield. An understanding of the deeper meaning of the masks thus confirms 144 Art Journal</page><page sequence="7">what iconographic analysis of the objects had suggested: the common visual vocabulary of ejumba masks, ebanken shields, and warriors' helmets may be interpreted as accumulations of symbols of defensive power against the kussay.31 The decline of the ejumba is certainly related to the spread of Islam. This is not because Diola Muslims are opposed to the wearing of masks; in fact, other masking forms have become more com- mon since Islamization. Nor have Diola Muslims renounced their belief in witchcraft. The production, by mara- bouts, of protective charms and medi- cines remains one source of Islam's appeal in the Casamance. Muslims simply prefer to find more discreet means of combatting the kussay. At least they seek means that are not so obviously and intimately associated with pre-Muslim religious practices. For the ejumba are unambiguously associated with traditional shrines and, unlike the Kumpo masquerade,32 ejumba cannot hide its serious meaning within an aura of fun-and-games. Other communities continue to dance the ejumba. In Esukey, it is unlikely that the masks will be danced at the next bukut, for although a few old masks are still preserved, their owners are, for the most part, unwilling even to admit that they possess an ejumba. Twelve years of visits to Buluf have brought me only two brief encounters with ejumba masks. Only once have I been intentionally shown a mask (Fig. 11) and that was on the morning of my scheduled departure, on my fifth field trip. This mask, which dates from the bukut of 1919 or 1940, is a good piece with a finely woven frame. If it was once decorated with Abrus seeds, they have long since fallen off. Instead of palm fronds, it is decorated with cloth cut into serrated patterns. At the time the mask was made, young men from Buluf had entered the Gambian palm- produce trade. They returned from the Gambia with newfound wealth in the form of cattle and cloth. Thus, cloth replaced cowries as an indication of wealth, a change that is reflected in the decoration of this mask. The iconography of the ejumba was not static. Rather, it developed in response to a changing cultural context. Artists showed a readiness to incorpo- rate new elements into the mask's deco- rative program, at the same time assimi- lating these new materials to express the traditional symbolic meaning. Thus, as commerce with the French developed during the nineteenth and early twen- tieth centuries, buttons and cloth were incorporated into the ejumba as symbols of wealth. Likewise, mirrors became part of the power symbolism of the masks. The central elements, seeds and above all the cattle horns, however, remained part of the mask's symbolism for at least three centuries. The ico- nography of the Diola ejumba mask thus exhibits a remarkable continuity combined with a readiness to innovate in response to the availability of new goods and materials. Throughout this gradual change, the ejumba continued to embody the ideals of adulthood for Diola initiates. At the same time, the mask was the physical manifestation of the kutokoherit bukan, those individu- als who used supernatural means to pro- tect the community against the kussay. I have little doubt that, should I return to the Casamance to continue this study of the ejumba, eventually yet another level of meaning will be shown to me. This would not mean that the interpretations I have given here are false. Each level of knowledge builds upon preceding levels. The ejumba mask in all its complexity of meaning is wholly accessible to only a small number of individuals.

The name for the seeds, in Gussilay dialect, is bachiompi (bajumbi), which is clearly related to the name of the mask. The central fringe is sometimes replaced by a row of rectangular packets made of folded palm fronds, reminiscent of sisafetas (charms) and perhaps holding medicine or Koranic verses. 17 Jean Baptiste Labat, Nouvelle Relation de l'Afrique Occidentale, Paris, 1728, vol. 5, p. 32.

Supposedly, the rains would continue until the shells were turned right side up by the village rain priest. 20 On the mutivocality of ritual symbols, see: Victor Turner, The Forest of Symbols, Ithaca, 1969. As expressed by Paul Claudel in another context, "II n'en est aucune, qui a cote de ce qu'elle dit tout haut n'ait quelque chose qu'elle veuille dire tout bas," quoted in Jan Bialos- tocki, Stil und Ikonologie, Studien zur Kunst- wissenschaft, Cologne, 1981, p. 204. 21 On the ebanken, see: Peter Mark, "The Ico- nography of the Diola Ebanken Shield," Pai- deuma, Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde, 32 (1986). 22 Interviews with Fiacre Badji, school teacher from Fogny, at Thionk-essyl, Buluf, March 1984 and March 1986. 23 It is not, however, clear if every component of the initiates' masks and costumes has a specific symbolic reference. Some informants denied such a reading; they suggested that the mas- querade figure should be understood as a whole. Of course, such reticence may reflect their desire to protect secrets of the sacred forest. Conceivably, too, the spread of Islam has caused some of the symbolism of the ejumba and its costume to be forgotten. Where there is no consistent iconographic interpreta- tion of a particular material or motif as it appears in diverse ritual contexts, and where informants are unable to offer a symbolic inter- pretation, it might be best to credit the words of an informant who stated: "The initiates learn from their predecessors at the bukut how to make their fibre skirts. There is no precise symbolism. Rather, the accouterments com- prise part of a process of education."

These clair- voyants were also referred to as kujuca ("ones who see"); On the kujuca, see: Sadiby Died- hiou, "Connaissances Approfondies du Milieu Diola-Flup et Detail d'Ensemble," unpublished MS. I'm indebted to Jos van der Klei of the Amsterdam Free University, for providing me with a copy of this memoire. 29 There are important similarities to the manner in which, among the Bijogos, two or three initiates were selected to wear the cattle- 30 The fiber did not affect me on those occasions when I donned ejumba in museums. But then, these were all old masks, and I wore them for only a brief period and without exerting myself as a dancer would have. 31 In this context, the primarily defensive use to which cattle put their horns seems to make the selection of cattle horns appropriate. 32 Kumpo is a raffia-covered figure whose whirl- ing moonlight dances cleanse the village of antisocial forces and fissiparous tendencies. Kumpo is generally presented as enjoyable fun; only on rare occasions, when a kussay actually attacks, does the figure appear in its true form as a deadly serious, antiwitchcraft crusader.
