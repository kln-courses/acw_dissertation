<plain_text><page sequence="1">Plutarch on animals: rhetorical strategies in de sollertia animalium by Judith Mossman Over many years of generous friendship and hospitality extended to me by John and Jean, one of the pleasures I have come to associate with visiting them, apart from elegant surroundings, delightful conversation and delicious food and drink, is the benign presence of a variety of animals, most recently that of Benson the dog. I recall John commenting on the absolute conviction of some of his colleagues in Philosophy that Mind does not exist, and adding that this would be a great disappointment to Benson, who is clearly convinced that it does, and that he has one - even if he is less sure of his own size in relation to other dogs, particularly Alsatians (Benson is a Yorkshire terrier). This remark leads me to hope that some reflections on Plutarch's dialogue on the intelligence of animals (.Mor. 959b-985a) might be an appropriate way to celebrate John's achievements at Trinity. I hope Benson will enjoy them, 1 too. The structure of this dialogue is particularly interesting (and perhaps also makes it an appropriate topic for a study in honour of one who can make even complex philosophy seem clear to someone as philosophically purblind as I): Plutarch uses quite technical philosophic debate as a background for a more naive competition between two younger and less assured speakers. This arrangement almost seems to be using two sets of arguments, one technical, one almost commonsensical, or at least based firmly on empirical observation, in favour of the proposition that animals 1 This paper was originally written as part of a two-part presentation (the other part, on Gryllus, by Frances B. Titchener), for a symposium in Delphi on 'Virtues for the People. Plutarch and contemporaries on desirable ethics', organized by Luc van der Stockt and sponsored by the Fund for Scientific Research of the K.U. Leuven. The original co-authored version will appear in the proceedings of that seminar. I am most grateful to both Fran and Luc for allowing me to present an adapted version to John. John himself kindly read it for that occasion, and I also owe much to the constructive criticisms and help of Monica Gale, Hubert Martin, Jan Opsomer and Christopher Pelling.</page><page sequence="2">142 Judith Mossman are rational and (not: consequently, but: in any case) deserve to be treated well by humans. Coherence is preserved by the fact that the material in the less philosophical part sometimes echoes the earlier conversation, at least in terms of its subject-matter and its choice of examples, and, importantly, in the way in which the dialogue comes to a somewhat abrupt end, as we shall see. Throughout both parts of the dialogue Plutarch allows his characters to employ frequent metaphors which quite deliberately suggest the blurring of the divide between animals and humans, and this technique, visible also in the Lives, here becomes integral to the argument Plutarch is making. There is no space to summarize the argument in detail, so what follows will concentrate on a few of the most striking ways in which Plutarch uses the dialogue form to explore the issue of animal reason. A. The Frame. The mise-en-scene and the dramatis personae are important to the dialogue's overall effect. The two speakers in the pre-competition dialogue are Autobulus and Soclarus. It seems plausible that this Autobulus, unlike the one who appears in the Amatorius, is Plutarch's own father. Soclarus is clearly a friend of Plutarch's family who does appear in the Amatorius and turns up often in the Table Talk.2 Their initial discussion (of which more in a moment) is brought to a close by the arrival of the two young contestants in the debate, another character who has agreed to referee, Optatus, as well as other spectators, one of whom, Heracleon of Megara, familiar as a genial character from the de defectu oraculorum, is said to be a keen fisherman and has a short speech encouraging Phaedimus. There is thus a clear generational mix: Autobulus and Optatus are older than Soclarus and Heracleon, who are in turn older than Aristotimus and Phaedimus.3 Just where all this is taking place is unclear; but we 2 He is almost certainly not L. Mestrius Soclarus, who should be identified as Plutarch's son, but T. Flavius Soclarus of Tithora in Phocis, the son of Aristion, who dedicated a statue to Nerva in 98 (IG IX 1 200), with his two sons. See Puech (1981) and (1992), 4831-93, esp. 4879-83. 3 Soclarus is younger than Autobulus and contemporary with Plutarch (964d). Optatus is Autobulus' contemporary (965c). Heracleon appears to be roughly contemporary with Plutarch's brother Lamprias in de defectu (see esp. 413, 418). There</page><page sequence="3">Plutarch on animals 143 are given some important information in the opening speech: the day before this dialogue, the same group of discussants formed the audience for a reading of an encomium of hunting. Autobulus compares the effect of this Xoyo&lt;^ to poetry: to the effect of the martial poet Tyrtaeus on Spartan youth. Most interestingly, he also declares that he himself experienced a longing to go hunting again, and expresses his desire with a quotation from Euripides' Hippolytus, from the passage where the maddened Phaedra longs to go hunting in emulation of the object of her secret passion. Martin, in an excellent piece on this opening, argues that the praise lavished on this encomium is in fact entirely ironic, which rules out any suggestion that Plutarch may be writing himself into the dialogue as the author of the previous day's speech.4 He does not in fact employ the argument that the tragic context of the quotation is that Phaedra's desire is a symptom of her temporary madness, and that therefore Autobulus is implying that the desire he experiences is a form of insanity, but he might have done. However, while agreeing with him that there is a degree of irony in this opening sequence, I am not sure that its effect on the dialogue as a whole is quite as straightforward as he suggests, especially in relation to Soclarus, whom he regards purely as a stalking horse for Autobulus, Plutarch's 'spokesman'.5 It is certainly true that Soclarus introduces the theme of the rationality of animals by quoting from the previous day's discourse and that Autobulus disagrees with the ideas quoted: but Soclarus' admiration for the rhetoric of the encomium need not imply that he is not somewhat detached from the point of view so elegantly expressed: indeed his stress on rhetoric and the playful use of the hapax auveapiCtov might even suggest that the choice of the subject of the encomium, and/or the piece itself, was not wholly serious. It emerges clearly at 960b that the previous day's occasion was a sympotic one, which might support that assumption. The syntax of 959c-d suggests a quotation from the encomium, which might be being praised for its literary qualities rather than its argument: the further are many references to the comparative youth of Aristotimus and Phaedimus: 965e. 4 Martin (1979). 5 Martin (1979), 102.</page><page sequence="4">144 Judith Mossman quotation from Euripides (this time the Aeolus) seems to suggest the style of a literary encomium. If Autobulus is allowed to be ironic, so should Soclarus be. There is no reason to suppose that the encomium referred to is in fact a real piece of writing at all, extant or lost,6 but I would like to suggest that, although it clearly is not to be identified precisely with the most famous and earliest KUVTiyqTiKO^ XoyoQ, that by Xenophon (because the speaker is said to have mentioned gladiators: if Martin is right and the encomium is an actual text by another author then it must be a contemporary or near contemporary one),7 there is a perceptible and important level of intertextuality with that work which is illuminating and which may clarify our view of the rest of Plutarch's dialogue. I think this intertextuality is created by a number of means and for quite a specific purpose, which is reflected in the structure of the dialogue: to examine and redefine the relationship of hunting and paideia, the assertion of which is the most remarkable non technical feature of Xenophon's work. It seems very probable to me that for Plutarch's readers the mention of a \oyo&lt;; about hunting would automatically have made them think of Xenophon: clearly Arrian saw Xenophon as the major authority on the subject and based his work directly on Xenophon without apparent regard for any lost works on the same subject. Plutarch is in fact the earliest author to identify Xenophon as the author of this work, and indeed quotes from it directly at non posse suaviter vivi 1096c. The strange phrase at 959c, kgTi yap eKeivoq e8o£e (lot to pqTOpiKOV eyetpai 8ia xpovou (either: 'for he (ie. the reader) seemed to rouse his rhetoric from its long disuse' or: 'for it (ie. the work read out) seemed to rouse its rhetoric from its long 6 Pace Martin (1979), 100-1. 7 Martin (1979), 106. The arena and the theatre continue to feature as a source of exempla throughout the dialogue: 959d and 965a presumably represent Autobulus' considered point of view, though 963c is not altogether easy to read as completely ironic. There is a similarly mixed picture in the rhetorical debate: Aristotimus' anecdotes from the Roman theatre are very much from the respectable end of animal participation - the 'Dumbo' anecdote at 968c and the performing dog at 973e-974a, both very lacking in gore. But Phaedimus darkens the picture at 977d, where he describes animals grouping by species but then running in panic to get away from other wounded or dying animals.</page><page sequence="5">Plutarch on animals 145 disuse')8 , might perhaps be explained as suggesting that this fictitious encomium had a classical precursor, and if so, Xenophon is the obvious choice. Xenophon and his book are also recalled in a number of ways throughout the dialogue, and especially in the early part of it: the connection between hunting and war implicit in Autobulus' mention of Tyrtaeus is explicit in Xenophon (e.g. 1. 18, 12. 1-5); Autobulus fears that hunting is such an all-consuming passion that it will lead the young men to neglect other things, Xenophon dismisses precisely that objection at 12. 10; Autobulus mentions Phaedra and quotes from the Hippolytus, Xenophon twice mentions Hippolytus in his proem (1. 2, as a pupil of Chiron, and 1. 11 on his holiness and self control).9 Autobulus, in arguing against the idea that hunting is a harmless outlet for human aggression (Xenophon broadly sees hunting rather as a preparation for war and a means of inculcating virtues, but see 12. 9) uses the analogy of the habituation to violence of Athens under the Thirty; not only does Xenophon give an account of this in the Hellenica, but he is also concerned with the relationship of hunting to society, though he sees it as beneficial (see esp. 13. 15), whereas Autobulus here uses the analogy to suggest that hunting, by encouraging luxury, has been detrimental to human society. There are a number of other intertexts with Xenophon which occur throughout the work, and to which I shall return, but this cluster at the opening of the dialogue introduces it as a hypotext for what follows.10 The precise way in which Autobulus introduces the debate to come is also worth noting: yesterday, he says (960a) they had declared the opinion that all animals are to some extent rational, that they partake of dianoia and logismos, and the upcoming 8 I am doubtful about Martin's interpretation of the phrase as meaning that the work roused the rhetoric of the contestants in the following debate (Martin (1979), 106). 9 I am inclined to accept the proem of Xenophon's On Hunting as genuine, but even if those who argue that it is spurious are right this is irrelevant, since Plutarch would have thought it an integral part of the work (as Arrian does: see Stadter (1976) and (1980), 50-9). For the debate see Marchant (1925), xxxvii and xlii-xliii and Phillips and Willcock (1999) ad loc. 10 As Stadter (1976), 161 points out, Actual citations do not define the debt of one ancient author to another.' Schnapp (1997), 28-9 also mentions this link with Xenophon, but does not really pursue it: see further below. Aristobulus' argument in this passage seems tacitly to contradict Plato's Protagoras (322b).</page><page sequence="6">146 Judith Mossman debate is presented as a consequence of this opinion. But the competition is presented as being offered very much de haut en bas\ it is intended to be instructive fun. Note the term Ppa(3ei3(JO|iev, which suggests adjudication in the Games (and see also 965d).n Legal language is also employed at 960a-b: TTpoKAjicric; and awrjyopcx; are both legal technical terms.12 We are being prepared for a more superficial and rhetorical debate than a philosophical one;13 the main issues are being presented as already clear. This line of argument is most clearly seen at 962d-e: of course animals have reason if you can argue about which class of them has more of it. This sense that the important decisions have already been taken the day before insensibly makes these decisions seem particularly secure, and even when the philosophical debate is partially reopened, by Soclarus urging discussion of matter which was too serious to be dealt with the previous day, there seems no be no real doubt in anyone's mind that the basic view taken then will stand. Thus the anti-Stoic polemic which pervades this dialogue (which could be seen very much in series with Plutarch's other anti-Stoic works)14 is given further punch by this dramatic device.15 Finally, it is important that the competition is revealed at the end to be something of a rhetorical device in itself: for all that stress is laid on the competitiveness with which the competitors approach their task, through the legal and athletic imagery 11 For umpires in Plutarchan debates in this connection see Hirzel (1963), 178 n. 1. 12 On ttp&lt;5k\t|ctisee Mirhady (1991), on awT]yopo&lt;; see Harrison (1971), 158 61. The legal language is reprised at the start of the first speech of the contest at 965e. On the legal imagery see also Hirzel (1963), 176 n. 4. 13 963b-c continues the impression that the tone of the rhetorical contest will be less lofty than that of the opening dialogue: the participants are veaviaKOi who will auvepaviaeiv, cfuXoXoyouq Kai (jnXoypap.p.dTou&lt;; ovtck; and will adorn (eyKaXXumffacrGai) the argument. 14 96Id, where the Stoics are seen to undermine themselves because they too try to train their animals, is a typically Plutarchan commonsense attack on the Stoics. See Babut (1969), 54-62, esp. 60: 'Tout comme Diadoumenos, en effet, Aristobule s'efforce de se placer sur le terrain de l'adversaire, pour mieux le confondre.' 15 As Sorabji (1993) points out (192) Plutarch travesties Stoic argument here. Much of the argument which follows is repeated verbatim by Porphyry in de abstinentia (3. 21-2). As Sorabji (1993) has shown, the positions of both sides really depend on making different interpretations of what constitutes reason and what merely perception.</page><page sequence="7">Plutarch on animals 147 discussed above and in other ways, in the end no real judgement is made, certainly not by Optatus, despite Autobulus' reference to him as an umpire at 965d; it is in fact Soclarus who collapses the competition into a draw and almost casually twists the whole competition into a rehearsal for combatting the idea that animals do not have reason.16 This setting up of a competition only to undermine it is a literary device used elsewhere by (for example) Lucian;1 here it further underlines the weight of evidence against the Stoics by stressing that the similarities between the two sides as presented in the debate are far greater than their differences from the Stoics, who are given no significant voice in the dialogue at all. B. Methods of Argument. The modes of argument used in the philosophical section are interestingly mirrored in the rhetorical debate which follows: a) Comparison The speech of Soclarus (96lf-962a) which follows Autobulus' dismissal of the Stoics is couched in terms of a comparison between humans and animals. (This is just one feature of the way the discussion is phrased which leads into the extremely anthropomorphic approach both of the philosophical discussion and of the rhetorical contest: see further below.) So comparison as a tool of argument features not only overtly in the rhetorical comparison between the land animals and the sea animals, but also in the more high flown philosophical discussion which precedes it. Soclarus compares animals with humans to the detriment of animals, and Autobulus' response is to compare them rather with each other and with plants, at 962f-963a. All plants are virtually the same, but animals are different from each other because they have different types and degrees of reason and 16 The authenticity of the end has been doubted because of its brevity, according to Helmbold's note ad loc. (though he does not give any references for this and I have been unable to track any down). But there is no need to suppose that the ending is not genuine: see further in section C. 17 In the Toxaris, for example: see Ni Mheallaigh (2005).</page><page sequence="8">148 Judith Mossman virtue. (Plutarch was evidently not a fruitarian). One point of comparison which is particularly conspicuous by its absence here is one very regularly used to distinguish animals from humans in Greek thought: their lack of language.18 Plutarch presumably would not have wished to allow lack of language to be a determinant of lack of reason, though he comes close to allowing Aristotimus to do so at 973a, where he contrasts talking birds with silent fish, very much to the detriment of the fish. b) Anthropomorphism Both the philosophical discussion and the rhetorical debate display an attitude to animals which is extremely anthropomorphic. This is however apparently quite deliberate: at 961 e-f Autobulus is specifically made to attack those (perhaps partly Aristotle, but mainly the Stoics) who insist on making animal mental processes into similes with dxjaveu By 962d he is using without argument or comment terms for moral qualities of animals, even including avSpeia (see further in the next section). Is this usage metaphorical or not? It is left delicately uncertain (though I shall discuss instances of it under the heading of metaphor). The degree to which these expressions can be read as live metaphors is left deliberately unclear, which can give the narrative an air of naivete. In a sense, though, any naivete about this is false: the fact that such terms can be used of animals and have a recognisable application for the reader in itself stacks up the argument against the Stoics. It also seems fair to point out, as Newmyer has done, that it is still the case that those modern philosophers who wish to accord moral status to animals are vulnerable to charges of anthropomorphism. He quotes Griffin (1992), 24: 'When one carefully examines such charges of anthropomorphism, it turns out that they entail the implicit assumption that whatever it is suggested that animals might do, or think, really is a uniquely human attribute. Such an assumption begs the question being asked because it presupposes a negative answer and is thus literally a confession of 18 See Gera (2003), 11-7, 57-67, 207-12 and Sorabji (1993), 2, 80-6, and 216-9 on the extraordinary similarities between the ancient and the modern debates about the importance of language in determining animal reason; see also Newmyer (1999).</page><page sequence="9">Plutarch on animals 149 prejudgement or prejudice.' (Newmyer (1999), 107 n. 18). Plutarch has other, rather subtle, ways of collapsing the differences between humans and animals, especially his use of metaphor, which I will examine in the next section; his anthropomorphism, I would argue, is not a mistake but a rhetorical strategy. Anthropomorphism is so widespread in all ancient writings about animals (certainly in Xenophon and Arrian on hunting: see e.g. Xen. 6. 15, Arr. 7. 6 on the hounds' enthusiasm for the hunt), that it is easy for Plutarch to slip human qualities into his animal subjects almost without the reader noticing. A more complex instance of this occurs when Autobulus turns the 'humans are better than animals' argument on its head by arguing that animals are often superior to humans in terms of perception (but that does not mean humans have no perception at all), which is a clever move because the Stoics' arguments on animal reason depended heavily on an expanded sense of perception. The metaphor he uses for animal intellect at 963b, comparing it to an eye with a cataract, is the climax of this stage; his next argument, that animals can go mad, therefore they must originally be sane (that is, rational) distinguishes perception from reason but continues the human/animal blurring by comparing the mad dog with a mad human (963e). Soclarus' answering speech is interesting in this context, especially the way in which he expresses the essential problem against which their philosophical opponents are attempting to argue: either humans are unjust or life becomes impossible: Kai tpottov Tiva Gqpicjv p(ov fkcoCTopeOa, Tag auo twv 0r|picov TTpoepevoi xPeLag (964a).19 This speech perhaps constitutes the best argument against Martin's characterization of Soclarus as a stooge for the Socratic Autobulus,20 since it does raise the question of how to put the implications of the foregoing 19 There is a note of traditional wisdom in the quotation from Hesiod here, and the general position is very similar to modern contractarianism: ie. animals do not have rights because they cannot make contracts. See Sorabji (1993), 8, 117, 161-6, and Newmyer (1992), (1995), and (1997). 20 The midwifery image at the start of Autobulus' reply (964c) is ironically applied by him to his philosophical opponents, it does not particularly characterize him as Socratic.</page><page sequence="10">150 Judith Mossman argument into practice - an important new point. Autobulus picks up on several aspects of its language and argumentation in his response, which still, interestingly, uses anthropomorphism to support its compromise approach:21 where Soclarus describes human life as being lived cf)l A.av0pojU(i)(; at 964a, Autobulus argues at 964f that animals who are c()iXdv9pa)TTa should be cherished, not killed.22 Significantly, he closes his speech with a reference to humans acting [I6t' w|_iOTr|TO(; towards animals, a reversal of the norm, since the original meaning of the expression refers to eating raw meat, an animal characteristic transgressive in humans.23 c) Animal Metaphors This brings us to Plutarch's use of animal metaphors in the dialogue, which is pervasive, and, as I have said, contributes to his argument by subtly collapsing the differences between humans and animals. There are numerous examples of animals behaving like humans throughout the dialogue and these can be seen as straightforwardly anthropomorphic, but there are also a number of examples (in the speech of each of the principal speakers) of humans behaving like animals, which are even more interesting. Through metaphor the status of both categories is problematised. Plutarch is of course helped to do this by the literary tradition in which he is working, which from Homer on encouraged the comparison of men to animals: the comparison of animals to people is no huge step from that, and is in turn encouraged by genres such as animal fable (both in prose and in early poetry, 21 The argument that it is possible to make use of animals without treating them badly is related to the important passage at Cato Ma. 5. 2, where Plutarch insists that it is the mark of a good man to treat his animals (and his slaves) well. It is no accident, anyway, that Autobulus is made to attribute this argument to Plato and to Plutarch. Sorabji (1993), 118 and 125, claims that Plutarch is the only ancient author to insist that benevolence demands kindness to animals even if they are not owed justice. 22 Note also the medical language in Soclarus' speech at 964b, answered by TTapriyopLa at 964e, and the quotation from Aeschylus answering that from Hesiod. 23 There may also be a reference here (965b) to a notorious passage of Xenophon where he describes trapping deer using their fawns: 9. 1-10; Phillips and Willcock (1999) ad loc. point out that the slowness of his scent-hounds probably dictated these cruel tactics.</page><page sequence="11">Plutarch on animals 151 such as that of Archilochus) and the mythological topos of metamorphosis. So too in Aristotimus' speech the metaphors are intermingled with examples of man learning from animals which sometimes seem to have a mythological basis: the reference to spiders' webs as a model for weaving (which perhaps recalls Arachne) at 966e begins this theme, which is then developed at 967c through a reference to Heracles, taken up again at 972a, and explored more fully in terms of divination at 974a-75c (the end of Aristotimus' speech). Phaedimus to some extent turns this around when he argues that the land animals have learned to behave more like humans from associating with them more at 975e-f. Together with the examples discussed in the previous section, these passages show Plutarch subtly blending metaphor and argument. i) Animals as People We have already noted Aristobulus' use of av8peia of animals at 962d; it is also used by Aristotimus of hunted animals at 966b and of ants at 967d (and note dvSptoSou^ at 970e). In general Aristotimus' account of the ants stresses precisely the same good qualities as Aristobulus at 962d: KOivwvi'a, av8peia, to iravoupyou uepl touq TT0pia|i0u&lt;; Kal Tag oiKovoiiiag, may be compared with Aristotimus' 0lK0V0|iiai Kai TrapaaKeuai, to KOivodviKOv, av8peia&lt;; eiKwv, all at 967d, and his use of 8iicaiocnjvr| (with which compare SiKaiov at 970c) mirrors Aristobulus' reference to dSiKia at 962d.24 In recounting a Stoic story which has ants ransoming a dead body Aristotimus uses XuTpa as a simile, but the whole story acts as an illustration of the virtues he has ascribed to the ants.25 Aristotimus' use of simile 24 See also the comments on the social organization (koivwvlkov, KOlVMVlKGt) of elephants and lions at 972b and c. 25 He also uses a Stoic story, that of the dog's syllogism, to argue for animal rationality at 969b, but in both cases he uses the story in a very un-Stoic way, without much acknowledgement that he is twisting it. Is this characterization of Aristotimus as one who isn't all that good at philosophy (he subsequently, confusingly, rejects the idea that the dog is rationalizing and puts its 'decision' down to perception, which can't really be what he wants to argue)? Or is it a deliberate ploy to back up Aristobulus' irritation with the Stoics' determination to misuse the evidence of their own eyes?</page><page sequence="12">152 Judith Mossman in general is very different from that criticized by Aristobulus as an attempt to deny virtues to animals: when he uses similes he is stressing their virtuous qualities, not denying them, as with the example of the ants, or the ichneumon, described as arming itself like a soldier at 966d, and like an athlete at 980e. So the spider is like a charioteer or helmsman or net-handler at 966f, the hedgehog like a clever captain at 972a. Phaedimus does the same thing: fish are like wrestlers at 977e, and there is a fish actually called a fisherman and well-named at 978d. He also creates an extended ship simile to describe the symbiosis of whales and guide fish at 980f-81b. Tortoises uncovering their young are more joyful than a man digging up treasure at 982c, and the halcyon builds a nest like a ship (983c), like a coracle (d). Aristotimus' comment on animals in love is worth dwelling on briefly in this context. We are back with metaphor: "EpwTe^ 8e GripLwv oi pev aypioL ml TTepipavetq yeyovacuv, ol S e'xovTe^ ouk aTTdvBpwTTOv lijpaiapov oi)8' avacf)p68iTov opiXiav. The expression of this sentence seems at first glance particularly naively anthropomorphic (ouk aTTdvBptoiTOv), but when one looks closely at the first part of the sentence one can see Plutarch's use of language clouding the issue.26 Some animals have passions which are aypiOL Kai Trepipaveiq, says Aristotimus. eptOTe^ . . . aypioi could be seen as a slightly clumsy use of a transferred epithet - the animals being aypioi rather than their passions - were it not that this is a Platonic phrase used in the Phaedo (81a7) of human passions.27 TTepipavrj^ appears to be an exclusively Plutarchan word (though of course human love is regularly described as a form of madness, not least in the Hippolytus, which was quoted by Aristobulus): he uses it of human love at 43d. On the other hand, the rather flowery vocabulary Plutarch uses in the second half of the sentence (a)paia|i6v, especially, is an extaordinary word to use of 26 0r|p[wv is in fact a conjecture of Helmbold's; if the MS ttoXXwv is retained, as it is by Drexler, the following point is strengthened further. 27 Aristophanes also uses aypioi; as a noun of an aggressive homosexual at Clouds 349; that it was a technical term for a particularly aggressive type of homosexual is also suggested by Aesch. 1. 52. The Clouds passage also characterizes this type of love as pavia.</page><page sequence="13">Plutarch on animals 153 an animal, having as it does overtones almost of affectation and effeminacy) stresses with increasing intensity the anthropomorphic quality of some animal affection. So once again metaphor can be seen to dissolve the differences between humans and animals and create human beasts and bestial humans. ii) People as Animals Sometimes in the Lives Plutarch can describe individuals and groups as bestial, to great effect. Here similar expressions provide another dimension to the examples in the previous section, again, throughout the dialogue, though they are less frequently used.28 So Aristobulus refers to human dypiOTT]^ at 959d, punning on aypcu (hunting-trips), as he leads into his comparison between men killing beasts and men killing men in Athens under the Thirty Tyrants. He describes part of man's nature as (t)OVLKOV icai 9r|pi(I&gt;8e&lt;^ at 959e, and Aristotimus echoes that at 970c (of which more in a moment). Phaedimus claims that housemartins fear man WCTTrep 0T]piov at 984c. Once again Aristotimus provides us with a complex example of this at 970b-c, interestingly as part of an argument that no justice is in fact owed to sea animals. Once again his vocabulary looks back to Aristobulus' (even though of course he was not present for the opening discussion). In his last speech when presenting his compromise solution to the problem of how animals should be treated, Aristobulus argued at 964f that there is no injustice in killing animals who are ap.iKTa Kai (3Xa(3epa KopiSfj: here Aristotimus says of the creatures of the ocean and the deep: djiiKTOt yap eKelva KO|ii8rj Kai aaTopya Kai TTaar|&lt;; apoipa yXuKu6i)|iLa^. He then quotes Homer {Iliad 16. 34) and, in expanding the quotation uses d|iiKTOV again, this time of the subject of the quotation (Achilles). But only someone who 28 There is an interesting parallel use of imagery in Xenophon's tirade against the sophists at 13.9: ol pev yap aocjjiaTai TrXoucnoi&gt;&lt;; Kal veovq 0r|pujvTai, o'l 8e &lt;t&gt;iX6cro4&gt;oi traaL kolvoi Kai 4&gt;iXoi.

So he applies a quotation which he explains as comparing a man to the animals in the sea back to those animals, and at the same time compares a hypothetical opponent to a beast. C. The Characters of the Rhetorical Contest Finally, I would like to examine aspects of the characterization of the participants of the rhetorical contest before drawing a few conclusions. We have already looked at the preparation for the contest in section A). The start of the contest effectively interrupts Autobulus' tirade against cruelty (including the cruelty of hunters), as Soclarus announces the approach of the contestants and warns Autobulus not to offend them. He instantly identifies the opposing groups, distinguishing each with a quotation from Homer, with a third for Optatus followed by another from an unknown poet. This volley of poetry clearly marks the change in tone, as does Autobulus' declaration at 965e that they will follow Optatus' experience (epTTeip(a) rather than Aristotle's books. This seems to be less a rejection of Aristotle's views on animal reason (though Autobulus would indeed wish to reject them) and more a marker of the change in direction towards a more practical and anecdotal set of arguments. It is then Soclarus whose exchange with Phaedimus establishes the order of speaking and starts off Aristotimus' speech. There is a lacuna near the beginning of this speech, but it still seems reasonable to suppose that not too long was spent on the moral weaknesses of fish (Aristotimus' speech is as it stands about the same length as Phaedimus'); it seems therefore that his material on the capacity of hunting to educate did come early in the speech. I would argue that we have here another set of intertexts with Xenophon, with the twist that he contrasts the educational benefits of hunting with the lack of the same benefits in fishing. The overt reference in 965e-f is to Plato's Laws (823d-824a), the full text of which privileges daytime hunting with dogs and horses over all other kinds, and lays down that it should be allowed to take place everywhere, bans night-time hunting with</page><page sequence="15">Plutarch on animals 155 nets, and confines snaring birds and fishing to certain localities. The distinctions between the types of hunting here are made on the basis of the type of paideia they provide, and nets are in disfavour as being underhanded.2' The vocabulary in all three passages is very similar: for example 966b ((hXottovov (also used of the social and anthropomorphized ants at 967d), to which compare Laws 824a5 and Xen. 12, where he frequently extols the virtues of hard work using cognate terms. Aristotimus, like Xenophon, points out that the hunt is beloved of Apollo and Artemis (966a; Xen. 1.1, 6.13, 13.16-8). At 971a, the story of the hounds who will not eat the dead hare has no direct parallel in Xenophon, but may nevertheless recall his work in general, as he devotes so much space to hare-coursing, much more than to any other type of hunting. It is important that the Xenophontic paideutic argument in favour of hunting takes pride of place over any actual philosophic argument here: indeed, at 966b the main point of the previous discussion now appears merely as an attributed argument (ol cj)iA6(jO(j)Oi SeiKViJOuai), rather than internalized. It is in this context that the echoes of Autobulus' speech (discussed above in section B.c) should be read:30 the hunters and fishermen of the second part of the dialogue arrive at the conclusion that animals have reason from a very different perspective and draw very different conclusions from it. The virtues of the various animals are in large measure important in so far as they reflect well on those humans who interact with them (and this interaction can include killing them). In any case, it is clear that both speakers are considerably less expert even on a rhetorical level than their elders. Aristotimus is the more assured of the two, yet his grasp of the philosophical debate is less than secure (see eg. n. 25 above), and he himself acknowledges to some extent that his display of examples is in 29 Barringer (2001), 51 suggests that Plato here 'praise(s) the type of hunting that Vidal-Naquet links to the mature hoplite and condemn(s) that associated with the immature ephebe': if so, he may be wanting to redefine the straightforward paideutic approach found in Xenophon (assuming that the Laws post-date the Cynegeticus). For a full discussion of hunting and Greek education see Schnapp (1997), 123-71. 30 In addition to those cited above, see the use of r)[iepo&lt;; at 970e (of dogs), picking up on the language of 964f.</page><page sequence="16">156 Judith Mossman danger of being a little incoherent: he makes quite an elegant (false) apology for his collocation of ants and elephants at 968b, but at 970e his apology for the variety of his examples on the grounds that animals display more than one virtue at once seems rather engagingly inexpert.31 Some of his examples are really more repetitive than polyvalent, like the doublet of Porus' elephant at 970 c-d and the elephants at 974d, for all his attempts to give these a different aspect. One area where he does seem to introduce a new and germane argument is that of animal — or, more precisely bird - speech and song, at 972f-973e. It is possible that his remark that birds teach humans 'in some measure (tpOTTOV Tiva) that they too are endowed both with rational utterance and with articulate (evapGpou) voice'32 looks back in its qualified assertion of animal rationality to 963b; but as we saw above, in general this well established argument is absent from the first discussion. And Aristotimus does this well, establishing logically that birds teach each other to sing as well as learning to talk, and so simultaneously enlightening their instructors about animal reason. The legal metaphor at 973a (rrpoSiKeiv tea! CTDvqyopetu) makes the birds' achievement seem the more impressive. At the end of his speech (975c), Heracleon addresses Phaedimus. His command to him to raise his brows perhaps suggests Homeric-style glowering (as in the formula UTToSpa i8cov), in which case this echoes the Homeric quotations which heralded the first speech. He comments on Aristotimus' speech: ov TTCtiSid to XP'Hlia T°u Xoyou yeyovev, dXK' eppw|ievo&lt;; aywv Kal pryropeia KiyKXiSwv efTiSeoucra kol PqfiaTcx;. This confirms what was said earlier about the contest being not wholly serious in intent, and also picks up on the legal imagery we noticed earlier.33 It may also once again suggest an educative process: the speakers have progressed beyond childish games and (in terms of the imagery, anyway), into adult activities. But that 11 Is there an echo here ofXenophon's self-deprecation at 13. 4-5? 32 The insistence on articulation is tendentious (is Aristotimus once again being characterized as one who has either imperfectly digested his philosophy or is deliberately overriding others' distinctions?): see Sorabji (1993), 80-1 for its importance in the argument of Diogenes of Babylon (DL 7. 55). 33 And see also TrapaiTetcrGai in 975c.</page><page sequence="17">Plutarch on animals 157 none of this is very serious becomes apparent at the start of Phaedimus' speech: the fishermen are hungover, Aristotimus disgustingly sober. The reference to the preceding day, though, sets the scene (I would argue) for another oblique reference to Xenophon. Xenophon rejects criticism of hunting on the grounds that it distracts people from their domestic concerns and stresses that it promotes the good of the city and therefore everyone's domestic well-being (12. 10-11; in the same section (12. 15-21) he insists on the virtue of hard work (intrinsic to the practice of hunting as he has described it).34 Phaedimus' words turn some of this on its head as he describes the dogs and horses and the nets lying idle, and stresses the amount of leisure they have to discuss the issue. And yet there may be an underlying sense that the contest is providing at least as much good paideia as a hunting trip could, in the light of the earlier discussion and indeed of Heracleon's words, suggesting that the level of debate has been higher than expected. The military word 6KexelPLa might suggest that Phaedimus shares Xenophon's view of these activities as a good preparation for war, and is explaining the debate in terms which correct the vocabulary of leisure and diversion much in the same way that Heracleon corrected the impression of a childish game with his legal imagery. It could be argued that the whole contest was an illustration of Xenophon's dictum that TTCuSeuoT^ yap Ka\f| 8i8dcncei xpfjcQ011- vopon; Kal Xeyeiv TTepi twv SiKaicov Kai ctKOueiv. Certainly Phaedimus' later argument that sea creatures, being harder to catch, train fishermen to be more cunning (976c-e) seems to be developing the Xenophontic argument that hunting promotes other qualities. But it also may well be that there is an ironic undercurrent here. Phaedimus has, as he points out, the harder task in this debate (975e), but nonetheless sometimes appears a little inept. His argument at 975f, that the land animals have become imbued with human habits because of their proximity to humans, is interesting in itself, but then finishes with a very self-defeating metaphor at 975f. He is essentially employing the same criteria as 34 The figure of Heracles seems to be hovering behind the text here, especially in the personification of Virtue, though he is not one of the pupils of Chiron listed in the opening chapter: see Phillips and Willcock (1999) ad loc.</page><page sequence="18">158 Judith Mossman Aristotimus (CTweaew^ epya tea! |±vrj|ir|£ Kai KOivwviaq, 975e), but sometimes uses examples less than well (the story of Crassus and his moray eel is over-elaborated for the context, it cannot be wise to describe his fellow-fishermen as like the Persians in 977e, and it might be thought dangerous for his argument as a whole that he remarks (982c) about the crocodile's prescience about where the Nile will reach: ov cf)aai A.oyiKr|V a\Xa [iavTiKT|v). He indirectly attacks Aristotimus not only for the dubiousness of some of the sources of his examples (but then uses some dubious sources himself, including the final story which he admits is mythical and apologises for, but also plenty of material from Egypt which has no health-warning on it), but also for introducing 8o£a&lt;^ (juXoaoc^wv, which seems discordant with the first part of the dialogue. That said, he often takes up points from the previous speech in the manner of a good debater: for example, at 976c he mentions divination with crocodiles, answering Aristotimus' last point, he compares the sea bass favourably with Porus' elephant because it draws the hook out of his own flesh at 977b, refuses to believe Aristotimus' story at 972b, attributed to Juba, about elephants helping each other out of pits (977d), picks up what he says about hedgehogs at 979a-b, refocuses his account of the ichneumon preparing to attack the crocodile at 980e, turns Aristotimus' point that the gods prefer hunting to fishing against him at 983e-984c. He even purports to complete one of Aristotimus' dog stories (at 969e) by adding a prequel in the form of an incident where the dolphins bring Hesiod's corpse to light in the first place.35 This polemical approach on the whole makes Phaedimus' speech less inventive in terms of its arguments than Aristotimus', though I should like to dwell briefly on two passages: first, the octopus at 978f-979a. The starting point for 35 There are also some sets of examples which less explicitly balance something in Aristotimus' speech: for example, Phaedimus' account of fishy procreation balances Aristotimus' examples of animal passions, and his example of the education of seals reflects Aristotimus on the nightingale teaching her offspring how to sing. The dolphin stories in general provide a counterpart to the dog stories in Aristotimus' speech, and he matches Aristotimus' examples of ingenuity with stories of fishy ingenuity in catching their own prey. On the octopus in this section see Detienne and Vernant (1991), 27 54.</page><page sequence="19">Plutarch on animals 159 this part of the discussion is the early statement of Aristotimus at 965e that the octopus eats his own tentacles. Phaedimus defends the octopus against this charge (implying, Aristotimus says, that the octopus is apyoc; f| dvaicr0r|TO&lt;; f| yacrTpipapyot; f| Traai toijtoi^ evoxo^); on the contrary, its behaviour is caused by cunning and is aimed at ensuring that it remains the hunter rather than the prey. He concludes by interestingly applying the Xenophontic concept of hunting as paideia to the fish themselves, and portraying the food chain as a competition in terms which suggest self-reference to the paideutic activity he and Aristotimus are involved in, as well as referring back to 976d-e where he described the intellect-sharpening benefits of fishing: tcai tov kukAov toOtov Kal Tr|v uepioSov tcu&lt;; near' dXXfjXwv 8icj£eai Kai (J&gt;uyat&lt;; yviiuaafia Kal iieXerqu r| ai&gt;T0i&lt;; ivaydvLov TreTroLr|K€ SeivoTrjToq Kal avveaecji;. Animal hunters sharpen their wits on each other just as human hunters do.36 My final passage is 984c-d, where Phaedimus stresses the gratuitous nature of the dolphin's affection for man in contrast to that of the land animals, who, he claims, feel only cupboard love for man. He uses vocabulary familiar from the earlier discussion and from Aristotimus' speech (r|pepuTdTa); but he reserves (j)i\dv9pu)TTOV for the dolphins. Here he makes his only reference to philosophy, in accordance with his promise at the start of the speech; dolphins have by nature, he says, what the best philosophers seek, TO cf&gt;iXelv avev XpeLaq. There seems to be a suggestion here that dolphins are not only superior to the land animals, but actually to man, in respect of this important virtue at least. When he draws his speech hurriedly to a close, Aristotimus, in very formal legal language, calls for a vote, which as we have seen does not come to pass: the agon is instead collapsed into general proof that animals do have reason. The rhetorical polemic of both speeches (but particularly Phaedimus') is undermined in 36 Detienne and Vernant (1991), 33 and n. 42 curiously make this passage to human hunters rather than piscine ones.</page><page sequence="20">160 Judith Mossman favour of Soclarus combining both speeches against the Stoic point of view. Hartman called this piece 'dulcissimus hie suavissimusque liber'; Dodds called it 'one of the most charming of Plutarch's dialogues';37 neither they nor most other scholars take it very seriously. I hope to have shown that it has a high level of literary and rhetorical sophistication, however, and I would also like to assert that it has some philosophical value as well.38 Its claim to contribute to the philosophical debate on animals must rest, as Sorabji has shown, on its assertion that animals are owed kindness even if not justice (see above, n. 21). But its form may also contribute something more serious than attractive and persuasive presentation. In his discussion of the two main modern theories about animal rights, Sorabji identifies as problematic their tendency to 'one-dimensionality' (213), and in comparing the ancient theories with them remarks (215): 'The Stoic idea of animals as occupying a single circle beyond the outermost limit of concern overlooked the variety of connexions we may have with them. The idea that all just dealing depended on contract and expediency overlooked the many other springs of justice. Moral theories may seek to make things manageable by reducing all considerations to one. Insofar as they do, this is so much the worse for them.' He insists upon 'the need for multiple considerations in ethics' (218). One of the consequences of employing the dialogue form, and indeed introducing two interdependent discussions, is that Plutarch avoids the danger of one-dimensionality. By introducing four very different major characters, all of whom have very different views of what is owed to animals, but all of whom have, from their different perspectives, respect and admiration for them, Plutarch is able to suggest a wide 'variety of connexions' between humans and animals and use them against the Stoics. This is not really a piece which 'attacks' hunting and fishing, or defends them; it has a wider agenda than that, seeking rather to combat a mindset which Plutarch sees as mistaking the place of man in the universe 37 Hartman (1916), 567; Dodds (1933), 104. 38 It appears to have had some influence: for one thing, it seems likely that the author of the pseudo-Oppianic Cynegetica had in mind the opposition between hunting and fishing presented here when he wrote his companion piece to the Halieutica.</page><page sequence="21">Plutarch on animals 161 than to target one activity or another (unlike Plato in the Laws). So none of the characters is particularly unsympathetic, none dominant for the whole essay. The intertextuality with Xenophon adds a further dimension. Sometimes the connection he makes between hunting and paideia seems to be being validated, sometimes challenged; but the distinction he makes between sophists and true philosophers (13) and the idea that interaction with animals is important for the rest of one's activities (12) tacitly informs a good deal of the debate. So charming indeed though it may be, there is more to this essay than an amusing collection of cute anecdotes and dodgy natural history; Plutarch (like John) achieves both an affable exterior form and true intellectual distinction.
