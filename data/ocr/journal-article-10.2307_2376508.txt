New York: The Mac- millan Company, 1912. Pp. x, 371. Professor Leuba's valuable book is made up of four quite distinct discussions. The first is an attempt to define the "na- ture" of religion, and to discriminate it from other types of human reaction upon experience; the second is an inquiry,- based chiefly upon anthropological data, with some supplemen- tation from child-psychology,-into the origin of religion and its relation to other phases of primitive belief and practice; the third is a refutation of "empirical apologetics," i. e., of the at- tempt to base religious beliefs purely upon "the testimony of inner experience"; and the fourth is in the prophetic vein, offering an outline of a "religion of the future" which seems to the author, on the one hand, not to be in conflict with modern knowledge, nor, on the other hand, to be incapable of perform- ing the characteristic functions of a religion. The third and fourth of these topics are the ones most pertinent to the province of this JOURNAL; and it is upon them, also, that Professor Leuba has the most significant things to say. It seems best, therefore, to consider chiefly these. The author's examination of "empirical apologetics" has (if I may, perhaps somewhat unfairly, take advantage of the tardi- ness of this review to remark the fact) been curiously misunder- stood by certain of his critics. Some even seem to suppose that he proposes to derive from psychology a proof of the non-exist- ence of God! Yet his argument, though somewhat diffusely ex- pressed, seems clear enough. Characteristic, he observes, of much recent theology, has been the attempt to secure a change of venue from the court of philosophical argument and that of scientific or historical evidences, by an appeal to the "immediate certitude of religious experience." This experience is declared to offer positive proof of certain objective realities, external to the consciousness of those possessing it; it is even held by Principal Forsyth to have some bearing upon such a question of history as the resurrection of Jesus. The logical futility of</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS. 217 this sort of apologetics has often before been clearly pointed out; 1 Leuba's criticism of it is not novel in principle, though it is especially full and thorough. The effect of the change of venue, he notes, is merely to transfer the case to the bar of psy- chology. The apologist's plea in this court may take any one of three forms. He may contend that religious experience in- cludes phenomena so anomalous that no categories and no laws which have been, or ever can be, recognized by psychology can account for their causation; and that therefore they must be ascribed to "supernatural" agencies. The burden of establish- ing this negative is clearly upon the apologist; it is a burden which he has not as yet sustained; and he could only sustain it by adopting the rigorous analytical methods of the psycholo- gist. He may, however, contend that the subject of the religious experience knows himself, in that experience, to be directly ac- quainted with such objective entities as a personal God, or a risen Christ. The psychologist's answer to this is evident. The education of the subject, the mythology in which he has been bred, determines the imagery or the ideational content accom- panying certain natural experiences primarily affective in their determining conditions. He feels a sense of helplessness or of sin, and subsequently escapes from it; if he has been religiously reared, this will probably take the form of a representation of an anthropomorphic being from whom he is at first estranged but to whom he is finally reconciled. And the intensity of the emotional experience will give a vivid "sense of reality" to the representations associated with it. But whether those represen- tations are of Varuna, or Yahweh, or a patron saint, or the his- toric Christ, or the Transcendental Ego, will depend upon whether the subject of the experience is an Aryan hymn-writer or a Hebrew psalmist or a Roman Catholic or an evangelical Protestant or a neo-Kantian philosopher. But the empirical apologist may, thirdly, give his argument a pseudo-pragmatic turn, and contend that the often profound moral efficacy of cer- tain religious beliefs is a proof of the existence of the objects believed in. On this Leuba truly though brusquely remarks that "the superficial way in which the new theology uses the prag- matic conception of truth makes that conception appear ridicu- lous.

The destructive effect of this criticism of the ordinary argu- ment from subjective religious experiences to objective theolog- ical entities cannot, it seems to me, be denied by any serious and honest reasoner,-unless it be by a neo-realistic epistemologist, whose doctrine implies that all that subjectively appears ob- jectively is. Yet this result must not be understood to mean,- nor does it, apparently, mean for the author,-that the experi- ences of the inner moral life have no philosophical significance, no ontological implications. Not, indeed, that the moral life is dependent for its source or sustenance upon any metaphysical or religious doctrine. But it suggests such a doctrine. For it com- pels us to ask what is implied by the fact that "the world is so constituted as to produce the moral experience." And the an- swer to this question which the author seemingly regards as legi- timate and probable, is no mere 'naturalism.' "No system of philosophy is less firmly established than Naturalism." There is nothing which forbids man to regard his moral endeavors as part of a vaster process, and as a canon for interpreting the meaning and prevailing tendency of that process. "A religion in agreement with the accepted body of scientific knowledge, and centered about Humanity conceived as the manifestation of a Force tending to the creation of an ideal Society, "-such is Professor Leuba's "religion of the future." One is left at the end, it must be said, not quite certain whether the author means to be the prophet or only the predictor of this religion. Of the two remaining parts of the book there is no space to speak adequately here. I may, however, be pardoned for seizing this opportunity to correct a somewhat misleading reference, in the discussion of primitive beliefs, to an hypothesis of my own on the subject. Speaking of the now marked tendency among anthropologists to recognize a non-animistic,-which probably, but not demonstrably, was also a pre-animistic,-phase of early belief, Leuba rightly notes that the first important expression of this general view,-which, however, at the same time was being independently forced upon many students by accumulating ethnographic evidence,-was in a paper of Marett's in 1900. In this paper, however, Marett made the essence of this "pre- animistic religion" consist in "the apprehension of the super- natural or supernormal," and therefore named the belief "teratism." Leuba proceeds to quote from me a few sentences in criticism of Marett's view on this point, and expresses dis-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS. 219 sent from these (p. 13). The reader would naturally gather that Leuba's view and mine on this matter are at variance. In fact, the theory which he accepts as to the origin and content of the primitive "idea of impersonal power" is essentially that which I advanced in the paper 2 with which he has the air of disagreeing; while with the substance of my dissent from Marett he is in accord. That early "conception of nature," which Leuba calls by the already too diversely denotative name of "dynamism," is precisely the conception which I proposed to call "primitive energetics" or, after the most familiar Indian word for the concept, "manitouism,"-and the wide diffusion and importance of which I tried to make evident, chiefly by an examination of the mode of use of the principal native terms ex- pressing the idea. I cannot but think the author a little in- felicitous in conveying the impression of a purely critical atti- tude toward what was, in fact, the original formulation of an hypothesis (and of the principal evidence for it) of which he himself makes great use. At all events, he and his present re- viewer differ about "dynamism" only with respect to the most convenient way of naming it, and with respect to one minor question, which could be shown to arise chiefly through a con- fusion about terms. Leuba, however, seems to me to make far less use of the hypothesis than the facts would justify. The idea of mana or nanitou profoundly interpenetrates other elements of early belief, and affects the development of religion in many significant ways of which he takes no account. The value of the book as a whole is somewhat diminished by two characteristics of the author's procedure. The first is a lack of continuity. Having begun a psychological interpretation of the history of religion, the author carries this no farther than the supposed primitive stage. What one naturally would expect would be a continuation of the same historico-psychological study through the higher phases of religious evolution. Through the lack of this, even the discussion of origins seems truncated, cut off from the developments in which much of its interest and value would consist. And, in the second place, such attempts as Leuba makes to reach general conclusions about religion in all its phases are,-like most similar attempts,-vitiated by an odd 2 " The Fundamental Concept of the Primitive Philosophy," The Monist, 1906.</page><page sequence="5">220 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. neglect of a point of elementary logic. He hedges his inquiry about from the outset with a careful 'definition' of religion; but he is often not quite clear whether his definition is (a) merely a statement of what he prefers to designate by that name, or (b) a statement of the common elements in all the enormously diverse historic applications of the term, or (c) an analytical description of certain complex observable phenomena occurring at various phases of individual and racial development. What we desiderate is the last; but when Leuba tells us that religion "is" this or "is not" that, he is often reasoning merely in a circle; his exclusion of certain elements from the nature of religion, and inclusion of others, frequently means no more than that these elements do not fall within his own definition, or within that suggested by prevailing usage. At certain critical points the argument is singularly confused by this error. I sus- pect that it would have been better if Professor Leuba had, at least at the beginning, altogether dispensed with a definition of religion. ARTHUR 0. LovEjoY.
