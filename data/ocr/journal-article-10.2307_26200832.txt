EAN: 978-0197200001. This superbly presented and valuable effort, the first of several projected volumes, contains meticulous and richly-annotated English translations by ten contributors—with a 'prosopographical appendix', two bibliographies, and indices—of a heterogeneous selection of hermeneutical writings related to six passages of the Qur'an, 2. 115,2. 255 {dyat al-Kursi), 6. 12,24. 35 (ayat al-Niir), 54. 49, and sura 112, al-Ikhlds, by the following twenty scholars: Muqatil (d. 150/767), the author of 'most likely the earliest [complete] extant commentary' who 'does not hesitate to interpret anthropomorphic verses about God literally', and 'a Murji'i traditionist' who 'also seems to have held determinist \jabri] views' (p. 22). Hud al-Hawwarl (third/ninth-century according to Nuwayhid's Mu jam al-mufassirin but the Anthology dates him as fourth/tenth-century) the Ibadi exegete whose 4-volume tafslr has just been brought out of oblivion at Dar al-Gharb al-Islaml, based on a single manuscript missing its beginning, an obscure work that is in fact an abridgment of the Sunni (not Murji'i as claimed on p. 23; see Hind Shalabl's study in her 2008 edition of his Tasarif) Imam Yahya b. Sallam's (d. 200/815) tafsir. 'All b. Ibrahim al-Qumml (fourth/tenth century), the author of 'possibly the earliest Shi'i commentary extant'—although its textual integrity and complete authorship is open to question (pp. 24-5)—whom al-Dhahabl in fact called 'a staunch Rafidl who authored a tafsir containing disasters' (al-DawudT, Tabaqat al-mufassirin). The Anthology identifies him as 'a teacher of Muhammad b. Ya'qub al-Kulaynf (p. 24) when he was in fact his student (Nuwayhid, i. 349). Furat al-Kufl (late third/ninth century) whom the Anthology identifies as 'perhaps the most obscure of the Shi'i commentators whose works have come down to us', author of a tafsir containing 'material that disseminated doctrines later regarded as "extremist" (ghuluw)' (pp. 25-6) through dubious chains. Abu Nadr al-'Ayyashl (d. ca. 320 [932] according to Hadiyyat al-'arifin), 'a prolific author... regarded as "trustworthy" and an important teacher and traditionist' (but not important enough for Muhammad Husayn al-Dhahabl to be able to find his tafsir), 'whose narrations', the Anthology claims, 'defended the The Author (2011).

Abl Talib: 'If the Qur'an were being recited just as it had been revealed you would have found us named in it' (Tafsir al- Ayyashi, i. 13). Abu Ja'far al-Tabari (d. 310/923) the arch-mufassir, 'accused of Mu'tazili and Shi'i sympathies by the Hanbalis, but there is little evidence to support these accusations' (p. 28), when in reality there is no evidence that the Hanbalis ever accused him of such in the first place. Ahmad b. Hamdan al-RazI (d. 322/934-5), 'an early exponent of Isma'ili Neoplatonism' (p. 30) whom Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalanl in Lisan al-Mizan mentions as knowledgeable in language and hadith, 'then he publicized his atheism (ilhad) and became one of the propagandists of Ismailism, leading a number of prominent personalities to perdition.' He never authored any Qur'anic commentary. Excerpts translated here are from his K. al-Zina, a lexicon of theological terms. Ja'far b. Mansur al-Yaman (d. bef. 346/957), another 'significant Isma'ili missionary' (p. 30) whose K. al-Kashf (Book of Unveiling), a darling of Orientalists, is yet another non-tafsir produced only 'as justification and corroboration for the Isma'ili ddwa' (p. 31), a work that claims, among other tales of the absurd, that the verse 'no lewdness nor abuse nor angry conversation on the pilgrimage' (2. 197) is referring to 'Abu Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Uthman'. Al-Maybudl (sixth/twelfth century), author of Kashf al-asrar wa-'uddat al abrar, a large Sufi treatise doubling as a Qur'anic commentary in Persian and based on the great al-HarawI al-Ansarl's (d. 481/1089) lost tafsir which the latter said he had based on 107 Qur'anic commentaries. Al-Maybudl shared with his literary mentor a literalist approach to the divine attributes and a profound aversion to Ash'arism and all other schools of kalam, although courting incarnationism and unionism on Sufi issues: 'when it comes to esoteric interpretation, however... the bonds of literalism can be left behind, for the agent of interpretation is no longer human reason but divine inspiration' (p. 33). Al-Zamakhsharl (d. 538/1144), author of al-Kashshaf, one of the true commentaries in this anthology and the magnum opus of Mu'tazili hermeneutics, in importance 'arguably second only to Tabarl's' although al-Zamakhsharl is bizarrely described as 'Sunni-Mu'tazili' (p. 35), a contradiction in terms that has currency only in Orientalist literature. Al-TabarsI (d. 548/1154), author of Majma' al-bayan, 'probably the most widely used and admired Twelver ImamI tafsir' (p. 36), another great work that was influenced by al-Zamakhsharl's Kashshaf and his theologo-linguistic framework. Fakhr al-Dln al-RazI (d. 606/1209), author of Mafdtih al-ghayb, the hermeneutical monument of the Ash'ari school. 'Often subtle and intricate, it is a scholar's and a theologian's commentary, and possibly the largest commentary of the classical and medieval period. As such, it is a difficult text</page><page sequence="3">236 BOOK REVIEWS that presupposes a detailed understanding of theological argumentation and concepts' (p. 38). Al-Razl was also a Sufi and friend of Shaykh Muhyl al-Dln Ibn 'Arabl. 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Kashanl (d. 736/ca. 1336), the Twelver-Imami author of the Ta'wilat li-l-Qur'dn al-majid, 'an esoteric and mystical reading of scripture' (p. 39) often misattributed to Ibn 'Arabl and decried by our Damascene teacher Dr. Nur al-Dln 'Itr as a wholly unreadable Batinist work. Abu Hayyan al-AndalusI (d. 745/1344), the arch-grammarian author of al-Bahr al-muhit, one of the three great Sunni commentaries of Andalusia with Ibn 'Atiyya's (d. 542/1147) al-Muharrar al-wajlz and al-Qurtubl's (d. 671/1273) Jamt . 'Abd Allah al-Sharafl (d. 1062/1651), the compiler of al-Masabih al-sati at al-anwar, a disparate collection of tafsir-related sayings attributed to various second-to-fifth Hijri century Zaydi authorities such as Zayd b. 'All (d. 122/740) (whose Gharlb al-Qur'dn, published in 2001 in Hyderabad, was in reality compiled by the Zaydi scholar Muhammad b. Mansur b. Yazld al-Muradl al-Kufl, d. ca. 290/902), al-Qasim al-RassI (d. 246/860), and others. These sayings are partly Shi'i, partly Mu'tazili, and partly Sunni-compliant. Isma'll Haqql (1063-1137/1652-1725), the consummate Ottoman scholar and Khalwati-Kubrawi author of the largest Sufi commentary of the Quran in print, Ruh al-baydn, among over 100 other works in Turkish and Arabic containing much Persian as well, including a commentary on the Mathnawi. 'He describes his method as the drawing out of meaning and sense from words, particles and letters, and an attempt to enunciate the [gnoses] and subtle allusions that he had learnt from his experience... as a major Jilvati shaykh' (p. 46). His history of the Khalwati tariqa has just been published. Mahmud al-AlusI (d. 1270/1854), author of the major commentary Ruh al-ma ant, 'a prominent Arab Ottoman theologian and Hanafi mufti of Baghdad', an Ash'ari-Naqshbandi student of Mawlana Khalid al-Baghdadl (d. 1241/1826) and scion of an ulema family of sayyids whose scholarship was nevertheless 'coloured by Salafi sympathies and Sufi revivalism' as illustrated by his commentary's 'increased reliance upon... Ibn Taymiyya and a decline in his recourse to Sufi interpretation', which 'reflects a growing "Salafisation" of learning' (pp. 47-8). Another view is that the change in tone in Ruh al-ma'ant is due to alterations and accretions from foreign hands, possibly by the author's 'Salafi' son Nu'man. The forthcoming edition undertaken by thirty Masters students at the Imam al-A'zam University in Baghdad should soon shed light on Shaykh Muhammad Zahid al-Kawtharl's (1296-1371/1879-1952) contention in his Maqalat (p. 344) that 'he [Nu'man al-AlusI] cannot be trusted over the publication of his father's commentary, and if someone were to compare it [the Nu'man edition in Bulaq in 1301/1884] with the [autograph] manuscript kept today at the Raghib Basha library in Istanbul, which is the manuscript gifted by the author to the Sultan 'Abd al-Majld Khan, one would certainly find in it what will make him certain of that.'

Sayyid Abu al-A'la al-Mawdudl (d. 1399/1979), author of Tafhlm al-Qur'an and one of the founding figures of revolutionary Islam, 'arguably the most widely read commentary in Urdu (and perhaps even in English through its translation)' (p. 51), who used his Deobandi education and journalistic background to formulate an activism-oriented 'scholar-free' hermeneutic calling, Sayyid Qutb like, for Muslims to confront and reform, one and all, whatever is conceived to clash with the Word of God outside the strictures of Islamic tradition. Most of the prominent Deobandis of his time at one point or another wrote to warn against what they considered to be al-Mawdudl's deviations. Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadl Allah (b. 1935), author of a 24-volume tafsir and perhaps the principal living Shi'i scholar in our time, producer of a more muted Islamist discourse that 'is noticeably ecumenical in comparison to other Muslim positions... along with his apparent liberalism in traditional legal matters' (p. 52). Like the Brill Encyclopedia of the Qur'dn, the Anthology of Quranic Commentaries tends to represent the ultimate meaning(s) of the Final Scripture as a decentred man-made endeavour. The marginalia is £/-bound fa-ma fawqaba. The Anthology relativizes the notion of Sunni orthodoxy with quotation marks: '... material that not only represents "orthodox" Sunni interpretation...' (p. 29) and keeps the word Sunna at the same suspicious distance (p. 41, bottom). The Foreword's single page (p. xi) insists that 'each commentator—and commentary—is a product of his own time' and proceeds to use the terms 'evolved', 'evolution', and 'evolving' in the space of a mere nineteen lines.
