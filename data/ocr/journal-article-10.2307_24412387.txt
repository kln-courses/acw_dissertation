We operate only with things that do not exist: lines, planes, bodies, atoms, divisible time spans, divisible spaces. How should explanations be at all possible when we first turn everything into an image, our image! (Nietzsche, Die fröhlichen Wissenschaft) In 1606 the scientist and mathematician Thomas Harriot wrote to Johannes Kepler concerning his theory of the refraction of light. A 'dense diaphanous body . . . which to the sense appears to be continuous in all parts, is not actually continuous. But . . . has corporeal parts which resist the rays, and incorporeal parts [or] vacua which the rays penetrate.' In order to understand the mysteries of 'Nature's House', Harriot concluded, Kepler must 'abstract himself mathematically into an atom'. He must, imagine himself the size of an atom in order to assent to the truth of the doctrine of 'atomos et vacua'.1 Contemporary hostility to atomism, with the atheistical taint of the 'damned libertines' of Epicureanism,2 will not allow Harriot to go any further: 'Things are such that I cannot as yet philosophize freely', he complains to Kepler. In 1591 Harriot had been denounced as an Epicurean atheist.3 If Jacob Bronowski's claim that the history of science is the history of metaphors4 is a little simplistic, there is at least an element of truth in this assertion. All scientific models have their origins in the ability of the scientist to envisage - or imagine - how a particular natural phenomenon is structured. The history of the atomic theory because of its insistence on invisible particles, whose activities and constructure had to be imagined rather than perceived, has been littered with scientific metaphors of more or less endurance - motes, vortices, sticks and balls, planetary systems, 1 Johann Kepler, Gesammelte Werke, ed.

The original success of Lucretius' De rerum natura as a popularizer of Epicurean atomism lay in its persuasive analogies with visible pheno mena, its scientific rhetoric. If Bronowski's dictum is correct, the longe vity of scientific theories would be in direct proportion to the popularity (or appropriateness) of their dominant metaphors. The persuasiveness of metaphors can achieve a lot, even in the face of powerful opposition; but the enemies of atomism were able to marshal a fearsome metaphorical artillery of their own. In this article I want to look at how the atom haunted the imagination of its detractors and its supporters - writing in both poetry and prose - and the metaphorical configurations used to exorcise or reinforce its burden of heterodoxy. In the seventeenth century the atom motivated a field of interrelated metaphors, used (and abused) by professional language-brokers such as poets (especially, but not exclusively, scientific poets), sermon-writers and political pamphleteers, and imposed upon scientists who needed to draw upon the imaginative resources of the poet in order to describe (or con demn) the invisible beyond our everyday perceptions. This impercep tibility of the atom-world sanctioned its imaginative heterogeneity, the images used to bring it before the 'mind's eye' could reassure, or it could terrify. John Donne's Anatomie of the World (1611) is an excellent ex ample of the hostility and fear which the idea of atomism provoked in the popular imagination. The 'new Philosophy' which 'calls all in doubt', multiplies worlds into a dizzying infinity, and also dissects or an-atomizes our own planet which is . . . crumbled out againe to his Atomies. 'Tis all in pieces, all cohaerance gone; All just supply, and all Relation: Prince, Subject, Father, Sonne, are things forgot.5 In this passage Donne deploys two negative associations which recur continually in seventeenth-century attacks on atomism. First, that a particular structure is divided, heterogeneous, discrete and so liable to disintegration (a fear which on an unconscious level perhaps articulates the fear of death). He then links this cosmic disintegration (which in some writers takes on an apocalyptic cast),6 to political, moral and social disintegration - which, with the turbulent political situation of the mid century revolution, became an increasingly potent association. 5 The Poems of John Donne, ed. H. J. C. Grierson (2 vols, Oxford, 1912), I, 237-8. 6 See, for example, Henry More's An Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness (1660): 'such contextures, shall one fatal day / Ruin at once; and the world's Machina / Upheld so long rush into Atomes rent'. Thomas Burnet also sees the Democritean theory of atomic dissolution as com plementary to the biblical description of the Apocalypse in his Sacred Theory of the Earth (London, 1679), 6. In his poem The Resurrection, Abraham Cowley describes the Last Judgement: 'Then shall the scatter'ed Atomes crowding come/ Back to their Ancient Home', Abraham Cowley: Poetry and Prose, ed. L. C. Martin (Oxford, 1949), 49.</page><page sequence="3">Poetic atomism in seventeenth-century England 329 The radical instability of matter, then, its potential for disintegration and consolidation (and the investment of these physical phenomena with cultural significance), were focal themes of pro- and anti-atomic discourses in the seventeenth century. In Donne, for example, atomism functioned as part of a moral typology of the discontinuous and the con tinuous in nature: the separate, the divided, the multiple, are perceived as evil, and the homogeneous, united and complete are perceived as good.7 Mistress Elizabeth Dury (whose elegy is the Anatomie of the World) when she is dead is described by Donne as A strong example gone, equall to law, The Cyment which did faithfully compact, And glue all vertues, now resolu'd and slack'd.8 The mind of Julia, in Donne's thirteenth Elegy, however is . . . that Orcus, which includes Legions of mischief, countlesse multitudes Of formlesse curses, projects unmade up, Abuses yet unfashion'd, thoughts corrupt, Mishapen Cavils . . . These, like those Atoms swarming in the Sunne, Throng in her bosome for creation.® Chaotic, formless, misshapen, swarming like the insect-like souls of the cave of Orcus, demonaic 'legions' of particles without coherence - all which resists the rationality and forms of authority is atomized. In dividuals in a state of anomie, isolated, exorcised by the community or its self-appointed guardians and arbiters are atoms. In his Obsequies to the Lord Harrington, Donne refuses to atomize the nobleman's virtues: .... I Should injure Nature, Virtue and Destiny Should I divide and discontinue so, Virtue, which in one entireness grow. Virtue is not a sum of 'purest parts', 'they have no parts, but simple be . . . . / for a point and one/ Are much entirer than a million'.10 Those men who fall outside of the Countess of Huntingdon's social circle are 'wit's mere Atomi'.11 This moral and political holism, or anti-atomism, is symptomatic of the great distaste and revulsion felt for the atomic hypothesis in the early seventeenth century - when atheism and social 7 For a brief but lucid philosophical account of this symbology in Western culture see David Böhm, Wholeness and Implicate Order (London, 1980, repr. 1983), 1-26. 8 Donne, Works, 232. 9 Ibid. 105. 10 Ibid. 273. 11 Ibid. 418.</page><page sequence="4">330 Stephen Clucas discontent were felt to threaten the stable structures of Christian society and its monarch.12 Fulke Greville, in his Treatie of Human Learning, attacked the 'useless Arts' of speculative natural philosophy, using atomism as both weapon and target. The 'vaine Ideas' and 'undigested notions' of philosophers Transformes all beings into Atomi; Dissolues, builds not; nor rests, nor gets by motion.13 Mathematics is plagued by 'abstract formes yet atomis'd' which need to 'be embodied'.14 Again formlessness, insubstantiality, division, destruc tion - all threaten a nightmarish collapse of values. Sir Thomas Browne's Religio medici, which uses a limited form of Christian scepticism in order to defend Anglican authority against the doctrinal claims of Puritan sects and their demands for religious, social and economic equality, is another example of an ideological deployment of the 'evil atom'. He depicts the proliferation of doctrinal 'interest groups' as an atomizing of the 'social whole'15 presided over by the Anglican Church: heads that are disposed unto schism . . . are naturally indisposed for a community, nor will ever be confined unto the order or economy of one body . . . when they separate from others, they knit but loosely among themselves . . . [and] subdivide and mince themselves into Dryden's Religio laid also saw the proliferation of sects as an atomization of primitive, revealed religion: the progenies of Cham and Japhet swarmed into colonies, and these colonies were subdivided into many others, in process of time their descendants lost by little and little the primitive and purer rites of divine worship.'7 1! This sense of threatened social order - spurred on by Hobbesian physics and political philosophy - persisted until the century's end. Richard Bentley, for example, held that Atheistic atomists 'undo the cement of society and reduce all . . . [to] original confusion': 'The Folly of Atheism', 1691-2, in The Works of Richard.

Modern social theorists such as Claude Levi-Strauss and Jean Baudrillard have also used atomic metaphor to describe the anomie of individuals within society. See, for example, Baudrillard, Cool Memories, trans. Chris Turner (London, 1990): 'the post modern urban individual . . . [is] separated from his alienated being . . .

Milton's Hell is an anarchy separated from the earth by the infernal abyss of limbo - presided over by Chaos - which combines the two hated infinities of the new science; ... a dark Illimitable Ocean without bound, Without dimension, where length, breadth and highth And time and place are lost, where eldest Night And Chaos, Ancestors of Nature, hold Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise Of endless Warrs, and by confusion stand.

This 'bringing together' restores atomized truth to the 'immortal feature of loveliness and perfection'.23 Those who obstruct the freedom to publish are the enemies of truth, Milton argues, 'the dividers of unity, who neglect and permit not others to unite those dissever'd peeces' of Truth whose 'body is homogeneall'.24 His argument for the toleration of schismatic divisions within the body of Protestantism also stresses an homogenization and con structure of discrete elements. Likening sectaries to the cutters and hewers building Solomon's temple (1 Kings 5-6), he argues that 'many schisms and many dissections are made in the quarry . . . ere the house of God can be built'. Although bricks are discrete and 'cannot be united into a continuity', or reduced to a homogeneous form, they can aspire to a 'perfection' of 'brotherly dissimilitudes'. As bricks conjoined can aspire to the 'gracefull symmetry' of architectural harmony and unity, so the pursuit of truth can unite sectaries in 'spirituall architecture'.25 In this Milton anticipates the metaphor which allowed post-Newtonian physics to flourish in a still predominantly Christian culture: the atomic 'pile or structure' had to be overseen by its 'great Architect', who ensures its coherence and solidity, preventing by an act of will the collapse into catastrophe, chaos and chance. The replacement of divine Providence by chance in Lucretius' theo logy, where the world is created 'ex fortuita atomorum collisione',26 was one of the principal objections of Christian philosophers to ancient atomism. It is interesting to note the extent to which the collision of atoms also becomes a political issue, especially as it relates to the Hobbesian idea of social contracts arrived at from a state of 'primitive war' amongst non aligned individuals. The comparison with Lucretius' 'cosmic whirl' and its creative impacts is obvious. Edward Hyde, Lord Clarendon, in his essay 'On Liberty', explicitly links the two ideas. It is small wonder, says Clarendon, that men who 'could imagine no other way for the world to be made but by a lucky convention and conjunction of atoms' believed that government arose in this way.27 The Royalist Anglican clergyman, Isaac Barrow, in one of his sermons merged his distaste for Hobbesian political theory, with unpleasant memories of the Civil War in a passage which is couched in atomist terms: 2Î Ibid. 549. 24 Ibid. 550-1. 25 Ibid. 555.

The solid ity of very dense bodies, such as gold or precious stones, he says, can only be 'broken or divided' by external force: . . . 'nothing but a civil war within themselvs (stir'd up by some subtile outward enemy, whereby they are made to tear their own bowels) could bring to passe their destruction'. The implicit identification of the status quo with consolidation and seditious rebellion with atomic disjunction (which forces the 'united' body to yield and suffer division')30 articulates an unconscious parallel between physical bodies and the body politic. In The True Intellectual System of the Universe, Ralph Cudworth makes a similar conflation when he attacks what he sees as the anarchic disorder of 'Democritic fatalism', maintaining that 'all things in the world do not float without a head and governor'.31 In an age when political pro pagandists were quick to seize on natural justifications for political actions, the subversive implications of the atomic theory of matter seemed acutely obvious to conservative natural philosophers. But radical politics could also make use of these same implications, and it was but a short step from a Demo-critic to a demo-cratic view of atomism; Edmund Waller in a dedicatory poem to John Evelyn claimed that Lucretius showed that: No Monarch rules the Universe. But chance and Atomes make this All In order Democraticall Without design, or Fate, or Force.32 Suffice to say that Waller's optimism concerning the Lucretian cosmos was not a widely held view in seventeenth-century England; opposition 28 Isaac Barrow, The Theological Works of Isaac Barrow D.

To Discover the Immortality of Reasonable Souls (London, 1669). Digby speaks of atoms as 'invisible Serjeants and workmen'. The atoms of rare bodies compressed by a dense body are 'like an Huissier goes before, to make way for his following Master, that obliges him to his service'. These rarer atoms are 'lightly armed Ranks', while the in truding dense body is like 'souldiers . . . [that] enter a Breach in a Town'. Lucretius, too, uses the regiment as an image of atomic contexture (De rerum natura, II, 323-32) 30 Digby, Of Bodies, 163. 31 Ralph Cudworth, The True Intellectual System of the Universe (London, 1845), I, 274, cit.

The language of the dis paragers of atomism combined to confirm the judgement of Lucretius' first English translator Lucy Hutchinson, who thought him a 'Poor deluded bewitched mad wretch'.33 The adjectives and analogies constellated around descriptions of the atom and atomic processes create a battery of negative associations. Abraham Cowley in his Hymn to Light describes the 'busy swarm of antic atoms'. Verbs associated with the violent or heedless actions of crowds and mobs abound: 'jostling', 'thronging, 'tumbling', 'jumbling', 'jarring', 'huddling'. The 'swarm' unpleasantly suggests insects, and is used widely. Sir John Davies spoke of 'swarms of atomies which do by chance into our bodies flee'.34 George Puttenham and John Donne talk of atoms 'swarming' in the sun or as demonic 'Legions of mischief.35 Dryden speaks of atomic subdivision as 'swarming into colonies',36 all with suggestions of infestation37 (Epicurean atomists were described by Walter Charleton, for example, as 'swarms of atheis tical monsters' who had 'infested' the nation).38 The usage also held unpleasant overtones of sedition and social disorder, being regularly utilized in political discussions of vagrants, 'masterless men' and itinerant 'mechanicals' from the time of Elizabeth onwards.39 The reality of invisible particles was seriously opposed in a number of references to formlessness and insubstantiality. Donne likens them to 'formless curses' in the Cave of Orcus, while Ben Jonson, railing against Democritus and his contemporary Nicholas Hill, talks of ghosts: 'in more forms outstarted / Than all those atomi ridiculous / Whereof old Democrite and Hill Nicholas / One said, the other swore, the world con sists.'40 Milton's 'Embryon Atoms', like Donne's 'projects unmade up', play on the seventeenth-century fear of the unformed, given folkloric 33 Lucy Hutchinson, MS (c. 1657), cit., see C.

The similarity between the atomic and apian metaphors was brought to my attention by T. J. Raylor's forthcoming article 'Samuel Hartlib and the Commonwealth of Bees'. The relation of bee to swarm, and atom to constructure both seem to embody the duality of private individual and social being, which makes them both persuasive metaphors in political discourse. Richard Bentley connects atoms, 'a swarm of Bees' and 'a crowd of men' in his Sermon 'Matter and Motion', 1692, ed. cit., 43. 38Walter Charleton, The Darkness of Atheism Dispelled by the Light of Nature (London, 1652), cit.

He also introduces two common themes: blindness (or senselessness) and the dance.44 The anthropomorphism or vitalism implicit in the notion of 'blind' or 'sighted' particles is made explicit by the anti-Epicurean Richard Bentley, who said that attributing sensation to matter would mean that 'every single atom of our bodies would be a distinct animal, endued with self consciousness'.45 This unconscious vitalism of the anti-atomists seems to stem from a revulsion at the idea of autokinetic atoms, moving and operating without the will of God, in a purely material and mechanical universe. Or is it perhaps a reflection on the purveyors of the theory, who 'wander ... in a maze of error' benighted and 'inclosed' by 'darke mists'.46 'The dusty atoms of Democritus/Certes have fallen into thy feeble eye',47 Henry More wrote of his opponents. Blind philosophers with blind particles.48 The dance is still more interesting. Dryden too refers to 'various atoms' interfering dance'.49 Why dancing? One reason for this can be found in a context given by Lucretius in Book II of the De rerum natura. Here he discusses the various kinds of atoms, through the semi-allegory of Nature as the 'Great Mother' and 'Progenitress'. Her procession around the world is accompanied with the 'rhythmic dances' of the warlike Phrygians, to 41 See Sir Thomas Browne, Pseudodoxia Epidemica or Enquiries into very many received tenents and commonly presented truths (London, 1646), in Sir Thomas Browne: Selected Writings, ed.

Given this burden of heterodox stigma, defences of atomism needed to wage a concerted war of images in order to make atomism a metaphor ically or figuratively acceptable proposition. The principal battleground for atomism was undoubtedly the question of contexture. If the enemies of atomism heightened the incoherence and disintegration implicit in particulate structure, its friends had to invert that atavistic prejudice - to re-integrate and re-constitute the threatened bodies. In their different ways Henry More and Thomas Traherne each took on this poetic task. If today we can comfort ourselves with the thought that 'bonds' and 'forces' will prevent the ground under our feet from dissolving, in a pre Newtonian world - and a Christian world which valued God's position as a providential governor or monarch of the universe - something rather different was needed. Divine intervention was brought directly into play alongside the atom and void, often in the shape of a mediatory spirit, or anima mundi. God, Sir Thomas Browne said, was 'one permenant point, without succession, parts, flux, or division', 'a common nature that unites and ties the scattered and divided individuals into one species.53 Four years later, in 1647, Henry More's scientific poem Democritus Platonissans used the same argument in order to platonize the atomic hypothesis. Sensing the rhetorical advantage of Lucretian poetry, More uses Spenserian stanzas in order to 'present to thee here . . . what I have heretofore offered to thee upon less advantage';54 poetry - using 'sportfull phancie' - can '[furnish] mens minds with variety of apprehensions con cerning the most weighty points of Philosophie, that they may not seeme rashly to have settled in the truth'. Following what he calls the 'noble Patrons' of scientific poetry, Lucretius, Epicurus and Democritus, he defends their 'monstrous conceits' against the 'Rout of the learned', albeit hiding behind the apologetic armour of being 'roused up by a . . . Philosophick furie', and by qualifying his assertions as a 'semblance of assent' which 'cannot amount to more than a discussion' which doesn't 'prejudice . . . truth'. The 'apprehensions' with which More attempts to sway the 'Rout' of anti-atomists concern the nature of the empty spaces 50 Lucretius, De rerum natura, il, 598-623. 51 See John Davies' Orchestra for the fullest poetic rehearsal of this version of the dance metaphor. 52 On the sinfulness of'lascivious and pagan dances', sec Robert Burton, Anatomy of Melancholy, ed.. cit., m, 134-9.

He approves the atomic ideas of 'that sublime and sub till mechanick . . . Deschartes', but insists that there must be a plenum rather than a vacuum between atoms, for 'if any space be left unstuffd with Atoms, it will hazard the dissipation of the whole frame of nature in to disioyned dust'.55 The reader is asked to imagine the 'tens, hundreds, thousands' of 'equall parts' which make up the universe and its 'unbounded voidnesse', but then also to imagine a God who is 'omnipotent' and who can 'eas'ly vent /His mighty virtue thorough all extent': What then shall hinder but a roscid air With gentle heat eachwhere be 'sperst and sprent Unlesse omnipotent power we will empair, And say that empty space his working can debarre. The vacuums are, of course, stuffed with God, who fills the gaps, an 'Ethereall dew' like rain running into all the cracks of the sun-baked soil.56 'For in each Atom of the matter wide / The totall Deity doth entirely whon.'57 His totalizing presence will 'steddy hold whatever must be staid', down to the 'smallest atom'.58 Matter itself, More says, 'rightly sifted's but a phantasie',59 everything is 'Life and Energie / From God', an emanation or shamajim,60 a Stoic or Plotinian 'Spermatick Life' which binds the 'darknesse dead' of the the corporeal.61 In a significant metaphor, More refers to the material world as 'knots of the universall stole / Of sacred Psyche', a woven fabric which integrates the universe, in which atoms are merely parts of a ubiquitous spiritual contexture 'fixt, [made] grosse by conspissation'.62 It is God's spirit - not chance collisions - which the 'im mense field of Atoms doth excite'.63 And the atoms 'change their energies' like a dreamer changes his fantasies, 'The essence of [his] soul not changed a whit';64 both the stole and the dream effect a unity within 55 Ibid. 90.

The 'feigned Corporeality' of materialists 'vanish[es] into smoke' in the face of More's 'living atoms', which are 'life, form, sprite, not matter pure /For matter pure is a pure nullitie'.65 More's atoms were not 'merely passive', but 'rouse up themselves on high'.66 Thomas Traherne's atoms, too, rouse themselves up, and become analogous with the regenerated soul of the sinner. Traherne's Commen taries of Heaven, written in the 1660s, was an abortive scientific theological encyclopaedia written in prose and poetry.67 In his poem on the Atom,68 Traherne sanitizes - or theologically rehabilitates - the atomic hypothesis, without using More's 'spiritualization' in any literal way. Nonetheless he describes a 'small Atom from a Mirie Fen' as it is 'awakened' by the 'shining Beams' of Christ, and ascends - in a seventeenth-century version of the hydrological cycle - to 'become a fiery flame' (1-4). The chaotic world of Lucretius is given full rein, the 'severd particles' (58) are 'broken into millions . . . dispersed into many thousand ways' (52-3), adrift in the cosmos 'a shatterd sea of mites' (102). The par ticles, unlike More's vital knots of spiritual energy, are clearly the solid atoms of the ancients: 'An Atom is a firm material thing' (414), says Traherne, they are 'Multitudes of solid parts . . . [which] lie . . . numberless concealed from the Eye' (221-2), their smallness secure 'Against all Force and Power' (287-8). But they are also 'the first Elements of Bliss' (184), like the semina of Sendivogian alchemy, moving with purpose, 'As if their Actions did proceed from Love' (160). Traherne, like More, opts for an immament God to give coherence to this 'shattered' and 'severd' diaspora of particles. The materiality of atoms becomes a positive factor, resisting the 'Force of Devils' whick seek to 'annihilate' the cosmos (268-9). His analogies are Platonic. Light fills the heavens, and although it is 'Divaricating, breaking all the way in Motes', yet it 'seems an Universall Ray' (107-8); Traherne creates a unity of the atomic diversity in the cosmos. He also uses the atom as a metaphor for the relationship of the individual soul to God, and to the community of the elect. 'For Souls are Atoms too, and simple ones' (395) says Traherne. Each atom is isolated in the world 'severd from his fellows' (348), but it avoids the de-centred incoherence of Donne's atomistic universe by reference to God, or the Sun, 'the Centre of all bright things' (345-6) to which all particles are attracted.

In atomic structure, and in the com monwealth, 'Each thing with cheerfullness doth sacrafice / Itself for the whole Publick Weal of all' (335-6). The Lucretian motes in the sun are used as an analogy for ministry, becoming bright by 'issuing forth . . . / And minister[ing] in many a Glorious Deed' (41-4). Each individual is, through his 'sin and ignorance', a 'Centre ... or little Atom of a mean Esteem' (67-8), until he recognizes the higher centre of God and transcends his particulate nature, by participating in the plenum of the divine: A Soul's Indivisible and can't be Dispersd by Particles: While it doth see The Endless Space that is beyond the skie It sees all at once, in Unitie. (141-4) As in More's poem, man and atoms are only saved from metaphysical desolation by being 'Exalted, raised [and] magnified' (58) by God. In another poem Traherne says that 'There is a court within concealed from Sence/ And open only to the Intelligence, / Full of Divine and Heavenly Wonders'.69 Sir Thomas Browne, too, needed the idea of the atom's isola tion and its 'fortuitous concourse' to assert the need of divine intervention: There is no such thing as solitude, nor anything that can said to be alone and by itself but God who is his own circle, and can subsist by himself: all others besides their dissimilary and heterogenous parts . . . cannot exist without the concourse of God and the society of that hand which upholds their nature.70 Without the cohesive 'concourse' or 'society' of God's will, the atomistic hypothesis - and human society - appeared to many in the seventeenth century to be little better than a collapse into anarchy. The atom, like Hans Blumenberg's shipwreck, came to function as a profoundly disturbing daseinmetaphor.'" A history of the atom in literature is a history of anxieties and unspoken fears, a history of neuroses. An anonymous author in 1596 used as a vehement curse the phrase 'Anatomize me to Atomies!',72 just as Shakespearian neurotics such as Macbeth and Lear had envisaged a Lucretian collapse of cosmos, state and self in which 'nature's mould' is cracked and 'all germens spill at 69 Traherne, 'The Ant' (5-7), Poems, ed. Chambers, 64. 70 Thomas Browne, Religio medici, ed. cit., 79. 71 Hans Blumenburg, Schiffbruch mit Zuschauer: Paradigms einer Daseinmetaphor (Frankfurt am-Main, 1979, repr. 1988). Blumenburg makes an explicit connection between atomism and the 'shipwreck' metaphor (pp. 51-2). The shipwreck and the 'unsichtbaren Katastrophenspiels der Atome' both possess a 'Katastrophische Produktivität' in the mind of the philosopher-zuschauer, which results in an existential anxiety or insecurity. Lucretius himself compares a shipwreck with atomic dissolution in De rerum natura, n, 552-64. 72 The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, entry on verb 'Anatomize', I, 67.</page><page sequence="14">340 Stephen Clucas once'73 and 'tumble all together, / Even till destruction'.74 The corollary of these hysterical narratives of disintegration are narratives of re integration and unison in the mind of God, a suture to heal the wounds of the scientific dissection of nature - the eternal return of the separated re united, as in comedies, fairy-tales, and in the profoundly anatomical dismemberment myths of Osiris and Orpheus, which had such currency in the Renaissance period.75 'God knows where every Atom lies', says Donne (in an anticipation of Milton's allegory of knowledge in the Areopagitica), and we too can make 'one knowledge' out of these fragmented 'minutes', disposing them into 'names, and ranks'.76 The severance and ruptures of analysis can be repaired by restoring the dis joined parts into a consolidated economy. It is ironically appropriate, then, that Donne's elegist Henry Valentine restores the memory of Donne (and Lucretius) to such an economy: If that Philosopher, which did avow The World to be but Motes, was living now: He would affirme that th'Atomes of his mould Were they in severall bodies blended, would Produce new worlds of Travellers, Divines, Of Linguists, Poets: sith these severall lines In him concentred were, and flowing thence Might fill againe the worlds Circumfrence.71 Once atoms and voids had been 'concentred' in a mathematical universe by Newton the threat of incoherence diminished in the scientific imagination - a tentative rhetoric of orthodoxy was possible. We could walk once more on solid ground. But the 'wild maze' of nature's labyrinth was still a ghost haunting the dreams of Christianity well into the eigh teenth century.78 The poetry of Richard Blackmore and Henry Brooke79 was destined to repeat many of these same metaphoric strategies: the atomomachy was far from over.

Greene's identification of anxieties surrounding 'The descent in to multiplicity' has obvious corollaries with the metaphorology of the atom. 76 Donne, Works, 'Obsequies to the Lord Harrington', 51-8, p. 273. 77 Henry Valentine, 'An Elegie upon the incomparable Dr Donne' (11. 33-40), in Donne, Works, 375. 78 On this point I am entirely in agreement with Dr Gavina Cherchi's censure of Ronald Kargon's claim that 'By 1700 the adherents of atomism had prevailed over the [theological, experimental, and theoretical] obstacles which faced their predecessors in 1600' (Atomism, 133) as 'simplistic' (G. Cher chi, 'Atomism between Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy', Teoria, 9, 1989, 187-213, p. 213n.). Anxieties concerning the implications of a particulate structure of matter can be clearly discerned in the poetic and theological writings of the eighteenth century. 79 Richard Blackmore, The Creation, a Physico-Theology in Verse (1711); Henry Brooke, Univer sal Beauty: A Philosophical Poem in Six Books (1734).</page></plain_text>
