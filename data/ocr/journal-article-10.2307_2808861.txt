Carnegie Institution of Washington Publication No. 507. Con- tributions to Paleontology. By Hsen Hsu Hu and Ralph W. Chaney. Carnegie Institution of Washington, D. C. $3.75 (cloth); $3.25 (paper). 11~ x 8~; vi + 147 + 57 plates; 1940. Previous to 1938 there had been no known record of the occurrence of rock of Miocene age in China proper. The discovery of deposits near Shanwang in Shantung Province have yielded large collections of fossil plants, insects, fish, frogs, turtles, and mammals.. A study of the shales and the physical conditions of the region, past and present, has produced results of great signifi- cance, not only in the Tertiary history of Asia but in the history of the development of vegetation through- out the northern hemisphere. The presence of aquatic plants and numerous fish shows that the shales were largely deposited in lakes. All evidence seems to point to the Shanwang formation as being late Miocene. "It appears to have accumulated during the time units referred to the Sarmatian in Europe, and Mascall to San Pablo in North America." The flora as now known is made up exclusively of angiosperms. Environmental factors seem to account for the absence of coniferous genera which are regu- larly present in the Tertiary floras of China, Japan, and Siberia. Omitting the herbs, which form a small portion of the flora, the ratio of trees to shrubs is 45 to 55. This relationship is "extremely high for a flora containing so many temperate genera, and cor- responds to that of the tropical forest near Manila. The relatively large proportion of vines is a charac- teristic of warm, moist habitats." The 50 plates accompanying the systematic part of this study give a fine pictorial record of the flora from the deposits. The seven plates in the second part show topography and modern vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the fossil locality and elsewhere in North China and Japan. Both parts are well documented. SPECIATION IN THE AVIAN GENUS JUNCO. University of California Publications in Zoology, Volume 44, Number 3. By Alden H. Miller. University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles. $3.00. 10~ x 6 ~; 262; 1941 (paper). In this exhaustive review of the genus Junco, the writer has not formulated his conclusions on museum speci- mens alone, as is usually the case in most works of this nature, but has supplemented his data with ac- tual field observations. The yellow-eyed juncos con- sist of the alticola and phaeonotus groups (artenkreis), and the dark-eyed birds fall into the oreganus and hyemalis groups with the caniceps (rassenkreis) inter- mediate between the former two. In all groups there is a good correlation between wing and tail length; no other correlations of large magnitude run through all forms of juncos with constancy. No environmental correlation of color (Gloger's Law), of size (Berg- mann's Law), or of size of extremities (Allen's Law) could be found. As to the phylogeny of the genus, it appears that it arose in North and Middle America and now shows no resemblance to the Emberizinae of Europe and South America. Vulcani is considered a primitive stage followed by the yellow-eyed juncos. Caniceps-like and hyemalis-like forms may have arisen at the same time in the interior and in the East. Each taxonomic form is carefully described, the range outlined, intraracial and interracial variations, and relationships discussed. The first appendix is a comprehensive review of the nomenclature, and the second lists the breeding localities of typical popula- tions. Altogether this forms a notable contribution for a better understanding of a difficult group of birds. PREHISTORIC COMMUNITIES OF THE BRITISH ISLES. By V. Gordon Childe. W. and R. Chambers, London and Edinburgh. 20s. net. 9 x 6 ~ xiv + 274 + 16 plates. 1940. Although paleolithic sub-men have occupied the British Isles for approximately half a million years, it was only about fifty thousand years ago that men who can be definitely identified as Homo sapiens ap-</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 73 peared. The cultural remains of these earlier inhabi- tants is not adequate for the recognition of the graded stages of development such as occur in France. The earliest culture that can be correlated with a correspond- ing one from the continent is the Aurignacean, but this was not developed spontaneously but was introduced from the mainland. All subsequent cultures are amply represented in Britain by such structures as barrows, cairns, brochs, etc., which are more numerous than commonly sup- posed. Excavation of these has yielded a great quan- tity of stone and clay shards, knives and spear points, urns and beakers, and from later times bobbins, bits, dice, and coins. In the present work all of these artifacts are dis- cussed in detail, as well as those of the pre-Aurignacean cultures. Numerous text figures and diagrammatic maps elucidate the text, and a series of excellent plates from photographs by the author add to the value of the book. Even the pre-Romanic languages come in for a share of the discussion. Of these there appear to have been seven, six of which have Keltic affinities while the relationships of the seventh, which is prob- ably the oldest, are unknown. The book is complete and scholarly, with extensive index and bibliography. MAMMALS OF THE LAVA FIELDS AND ADJOINING AREAS IN VALENCIA COUNTY, NEW MEXICO. Miscellaneous Publications, Museum of Zoology, University of Micki- gan, No. 51. By Emmet T. Hooper. University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor. 50 cents. 10 x 61; 47 + 3 plates; 1941 (paper). A report of a study of the mammal fauna of a section of west-central New Mexico on and around extensive fields of blackish lava to determine the forces directing the evolution of dark races of mammals on the lava flows. In the Tularosa Basin, where the lava beds are much more isolated than those in Valencia County, the blackish pelage coloration has become more com- pletely fixed. The study, based on records of 60 kinds of mammals (species and subspecies) indicates "(1) that the darker coloration has a higher survival value on the black lava; and (2) that the present center of dispersal of the darker animals is the black lava and not the lighter substrata near the black lava." DEVELOPMENT OF OCCLUSION. University of Pennsyl- vania Bicentennial Conference, M-12. By William K. Gregory, B. Holly Broadbent, and Milo Hellman. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia. $1.50. 9 x 6; 72; 1941 (paper). GENETICS GENETICS AND THE OIUGIN OF SPECIES. Second Edi- tion, Revised. By Theodosius Dobzhansky. Columbia University Press, New York. $4.25. 9 x 6; xviii + 446; 1941. The first edition of this outstanding book has already been reviewed in this journal (Vol. 13, p. 211). The second edition does not need a detailed review, for the author's point of view and his arrangement of the material has remained essentially the same. Never- theless a considerable number of additions and some changes have been made, and these deserve notice. While most of the minor changes are the result of the author's desire to make the text more explicit, the most important changes are additions of new material. This is exemplified by the increase in the number of references from about 600 to nearly 1,000 and of the number of pages from 364 to 446. The inclusion of so much new material is the result on the one hand of the recent growth of research on evolutionary problems and on the other of the expansion of the author's interests. The inclusion in the revised edition of work on the transformations of pneumococci is a good example of this. Some changes in the arrangement of the material have been made of which the most notice- able is a shift of the material on the theoretical signifi- cance of population dynamics from the chapter on selection to a new chapter entitled "Patterns of Evolu- tion." Among the recent works on evolution discussed and criticized by Dobzhansky, Goldschmidt's Tke Material Basis of Evolution takes a prominent.place. This is not surprising since the two authors differ even in some of their basic assumptions. A revision at the present time of Dobzhansky's ex- cellent book would have been welcomed in any case by biologists interested in evolution. Perhaps some of them will find it particularly valuable because it fol- lows so closely the expression of very different views by Goldschmidt. GENERAL BIOLOGY BIOLOGY AND HUmiAN AFFAIRS. By John W. Ritchie. World Book Company, Yonkers- on-Hudson. New York. $2.32. 8- x 51; xiv + 1026; 1941. The encyclopedic proportions of this high school text- book (1026 pages) may at first glance frighten away some of those for whom it is intended. However, al- though much more material has been included than an average class can hope to cover in one year, the 22 units are, in the main, independent of each other so that they can be taken up in practically any order, or some can be omitted. The point of view is practical</page><page sequence="3">74 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY throughout, the wide application of biological ideas to human living being constantly emphasized. The teaching method combines the type, group, and principles methods. The number of scientific terms has been kept at a minimum. The author is to be especially commended for the excellent and profuse illustrations which are a distinct feature of the book. Each unit is concluded with a comprehension test, a list of suggested activities and applications, and selected references for reading. The appendix contains a classi- fication of animal and plant kingdoms, a table of the divisions of geological time, a complete glossary, and an index. EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD-WORK OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION IN 1940. Smithsonian Institution Publi- cation 3631. Snmithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C. Free. 9' x 6; 100; 1941 (paper). Each year expeditions go out from the Smithsonian Institution to collect specimens, record data, etc. in the various fields of science. A preliminary announcement of the year's work is issued in pamphlet form. The present report shows that, as usual, much work was done in the biological sciences in 1940. Early man was traced in Virginia and Folsom man in the West, while various Indian groups in North America were studied. Live animals were collected in Liberia while extinct animals were trailed in the central Utah and the Bridges Basin of Wyoming. Grasses were studied in Venezuela, butterflies in Virginia, birds and mam- mals collected in South Carolina, and reptiles and amphibians in Mexico. Habitat group material was collected in the Canadian Rockies, dredge hauls made in the Gulf of California and the King crab (what we know in canned form as Japanese crab meat) studied in Alaskan waters. The many photographs form an interesting part of this brief report. AN INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGY. By J. C. Cross. The C. V. Mosby Company, St. Louis. $1.90. 71 x 58; xviii + 507; 1941. This book has been written for the special purpose of presenting southern plants and animals to students and teachers of high schools in that part of the country. Since southern' fauna are rich enough to supply good examples for nearly all practical purposes, either for laboratory or for recitation, the author selected those representative forms of the biological resources of the South that would be of most value in a high school course. The textual material is divided into eight parts or units. In general, the book follows the plan of proceeding from the simpler plants and animals to the more complex. The divisions of the material are as follows: Introduction; The simplest animals; Plants without seeds; The seed-bearing plants; Ani- mals with jointed feet; Animals with backbones; Struc- ture and function in plants; and Structure and function in animals. There is no bibliography but an excellent glossary and index are available. OCEANOGRAPHY OF THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN, BERING SEA AND BERING STRAIT: A Contribution toward a Bibliography. By Mary C. Grier. University of Washington, Seattle. $2.50. 19 x 7; xxii + 290; 1941 (paper). More than 2,930 items are listed in this bibliography. Important books, magazine articles and documents bearing upon the oceanography of the area defined and the inshore waters, with the exception of the coast of California, are given. The bibliography is divided into the following sections: General references, Physical oceanography, General biology, Plankton, Invertebrata, Pisces, Aves, Mammalia, and Flora. There are in- dexes to author and personal names and to subjects and titles. The volume is well printed. The generous spacing of the items not only makes for easy reading but gives opportunity to the student to jot down additional notes. PAPERS OF THE MICHIGAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCE, ARTS AND LETTERS. Volume XXVI (1940). Part I: Botany and Forestry. Part II: Zoology. Part III: Geography and Geology. Edited by Eugene S. McCartney and Mischa Titiev. The University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor; Oxford University Press, London.

Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, Massachusetts. $3.00. x98 X 7; 1941 (paper). This volume contains those contributions from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for 1940 that did not appear in Papers in Physical Oceanography and Meteorology. The 33 papers are unrelated to each other. Mostly they deal with the physics and chemis- try of sea water, although ecology, taxonomy, and ex- perimentation are not neglected. There is one paper dealing with the flight of birds. The annual report of the Institution is appended. PROCEEDINGS OF TIE SIXTH PACIFIC CONGRESS OF THE PACIFIC SCIENCE ASSOCIATION Held at the University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, and San Francisco, July 24th to August 12th, 1939.

This large volume consists of many contributions on all phases of marine study. Currents, oceanography, distribution of fish, research programs, climatology, are but some of the topics. These studies have all been made on the Pacific Ocean, from east to west. EL MAR Acuario del Mundo. By Enrique Rioja. Editorial Seneca, Mexico City. $2.50. 71 x 5 ; 405; 1941. In this book the author, a well-known Spanish student of animal life of the sea and now pursuing his research in the Biological Institute of the National University of Mexico, writes in a popular style of some of the lower plant and animal forms, coral, mother-of-pearl, fishlwith protective coloration or chameleon-like charac- teristics, and monsters, real and imaginary, of the sea. The book is written with authority as well as charm and is profusely illustrated. MANUAL OF BIOLOGY. Sixth Edition. By George Alfred Baitsell.

HUMAN BIOLOGY THROUGH CHINA'S WALL. By Graham Peck. Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. $3.50. 93 x 53; 371; 1940. The author visited China for the express purpose of making portraits of the natives and sketching their countryside. The numerous drawings in the book were not put there to illustrate the text; rather the text was written as a commentary on the illustrations. Peck explains that the disdain which the Chinese feel toward the Mongolian barbarians that are pene- trating the frontier is equalled only by that whichthe barbarians feel for the Chinese. The author is equally interested in both, especially in their personal sanita- tion, or lack of it, a subject of which he never tires. This interest is always in the individual, never in the group. The individuals also took a great deal of interest in him, and used to assemble outside his window to make peepholes in the paper window pane, that they might witness his ablutions and admire the hair on his body, which they mistook for feathers (the Mongolians have no hair except on the head). The last few chapters are taken up with the author's experience as a stretcher bearer and ambulance driver for the Red Cross after the actual outbreak of hos-</page><page sequence="5">76 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY tilities. The account of the rescue of a fifteen-year- old boy who had been lying in the mud for a month, unprotected from the weather, with a shattered arm hanging limply from the shoulder blade, and a fly- blown and maggot-ridden leg and whose only sustenance had been what he could beg from the peasants who continued to cultivate their rice patches amid the filth and stench of the bodies of horses and human beings rotting together, should be effective in teaching the reader what war means. But somehow one reads between the lines that even this war will pass. There have been wars in China before, but Chinese civilization has endured for three millenia and after each war it has rolled back again like the rock of Sisyphus. The war may realign all the ephemeral boundaries of Europe, it may destroy democracy and religion in the occident, it may be the tocsin of western civilization, but when it is over the author expects to see the old order in China restored, and when that occurs he is going back again. RIVER OF RuiNs. By Louis J. Halle, Jr. Henry Holt and Company, New York. $3.00. 8' x 5-; xii + 334 + 16 plates; 1941. The unoffiial expedition made by the author and a companion to the lesser explored sites of Mayan civiliza- tion in Peten, a jungle district lying partly in Mexico and partly in Guatamala, is the subject of this fascinat- ing book. The journey was made mostly by the water routes of the rivers de la Pasi6n and Usumacinta. At Paso Subin the two explorers felt that they had left the outposts of present civilization. At La Libertad they divided their time between studying the ruins at two sites and an embarrassing attempt to collect bird specimens for the Harvard Museum- their only ornithological venture of the trip. At Tikal and Palenque, the eastern and western extremities, approximately, of the region explored, they found "architectural capitals" from two periods of Mayan civilization. Tikal is considered to have been the first of the cities constructed by the mature Mayan civilization; Palenque the last. Of the well-preserved sculptures on the lintels of the bat-infested temple at Yaxchildn the author writes: I suppose these stones were designed chiefly to inspire awe, because even across all the barriers to understand- ing that separate us from them, they have that ef- fect.... This is High Mass in any language and in any time, whatever gods it may represent.... All this elaboration of costume, all this wealth of artistry, the subtlety of the modeling and the devoted rendering of every detail, were designed to lift men above their common selves to the level of their common aspira- tions. There is more here than can be measured by any arithmetic-more than what is included in any archaeological report. In addition to the descriptions of the ruins the book is colored by vivid descriptions of the geography, the natives and "foreigners," the vegetation, animal and insect life of the region, and numerous accounts of the explorers' adventures and misadventures. TWENTIETH CENTURY INDIANS. Photographs and Text by Frances Cooke Macgregor with a Foreword by Clark Wissler. G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York. $3.00. 11 x 8x; v + 127; 1941. The stated purpose of this beautifully illustrated vol- ume is to dispel the many vagaries and misconceptions concerning the Indians of the United States. The past century has witnessed the futile attempt on the part of the government and of the people of the United States to destroy the American Indians' native cultural, social, economic, and religious structures, and replace them with so-called "civilized" philosophies, concepts and activities. The fact that the aboriginal popula- tions failed to successfully attain the desired measure of "civilization," and that their stocks were being rapidly depleted, seemed ample reason to believe that the Indians represented an inferior race, and that there was not much hope for them in the present world of competition. A more recent and hopeful attitude toward the In- dian accepts his culture and industry as valuable in themselves without regard to civilized culture and industry. This attitude has resulted in better methods of education and in better health and living conditions for the Indians, and these in turn are preparing them for happier and more successful lives, not as white men, but as Indians. The author's photographic artistry has contributed greatly to the excellence of the volume. Two maps, one at the beginning and one at the end of the book, are of much interest. The first gives the habitats of the important Indian tribes at the time Columbus dis- covered America. The total number of Indians at that time has been estimated to be about 846,000. The second map gives the distribution of the prin- cipal Indian tribes in the United States today and marks the locations of small communities (Rancherias) in California and (Colonies) in Nevada. CRIME AND ITs TREATMENT. Social and Legal Aspects of Criminology. By Arthur E. Wood and John B. Waite. American Book Company, New York. $3.50. 8- x 54; ix + 742; 1941. As the sub-title indicates this heavy tome deals with two aspects of criminology, the sociological and the</page><page sequence="6">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 77 legal. The latter is discussed in the second half of the volume wherein an informative and comprehensive account is given of the elements of criminal law and of penology-liability, evidence, trial procedures, prison systems, and corrective treatments. Thus, the com- plete picture is made available of the reactions of our society to the trespassing against its regulations. The supposed cause of this trespassing, i.e. crime, consti- tutes the substance of the first part of the book. Woods, who is responsible for this part, examines first crime statistics and their value and the case history method of study of crime. He emphasizes the unre- liability of crime statistics, and in general has a low opinion of statistical handling of criminological data. So far as the etiology of crime is concerned, the author is mainly interested in the effects of the environment, although a short chapter covers briefly certain aspects of the psychopathology of crime. If this chapter had not been included one could well assume that views on criminality have not made much progress during the last century. Sociologists often accuse the human biologist of lack of appreciation of the so-called social sciences yet the ineffectiveness exhibited by the nar- row viewpoint which emanates from the dominating sociological approach should encourage further experi- mentations along other lines. After all, crime is a behavior problem and man's behavior is rooted in his "lowly nature" as Darwin put it. A selected bibli- ography follows each chapter and many references are given in the text. CULTURE ELEMENT DISTRIBUTIONS: XIII. NEVADA SHOSHONE. Anthropological Records, Volume 4, Num- ber 2. By Julian Steward. University of California Press, Berkeley. $1.50. 11 x 8; v + 151; 1941 (paper). CuLTuRE ELEMENT DISTRIBUTIONS: XIV. NORTHERN PAIUTE. Anthropological Records, Volume 4, Number 3. By Omer C. Stewart. University of California Press, Berkeley. 75 cents. 11 x 84; iii + 85; 1941 (paper). These studies give extensive data, arranged in notes and in tabular form, on the distribution of cultural elements in Nevada Shoshone and the neighboring Northern Paiute. The habitat of the Northern Paiute is uniformly desert, although modified somewhat by streams from the mountain area. The Shoshoneans, dwelling in the region east of the Northern Paiute, occupy an extremely infertile area, which necessarily has had an important effect upon many of their ac- tivities. Their food is largely rodents and seeds, which grow widely scattered. In summarizing and synthesizing the Shoshonean data, uniformity is shown to be greatest in the es- sential economic traits, such as hunting and seed- gathering: greatest variation in hunting, as in food- gathering, is in details which are dispensable to the main activity. Shamanism also has general stability. "Its secondary features such as the particular spirits and powers, ritual equipment and behavior patterns, are more variable." Both of these studies represent careful detailed work and form valuable additions to cultural investigations on Indian tribes in or near the Great Basin. SCIENTIFIC ASPECTS OF THE RACE PROBLEM. By H. S. Jennings, Charles A. Berger, Dom Thomas Verner Moore, Ale? Hrdlicka, Robert H. Lowie, and Otto Klineberg. With a Preface by His Excellency Bishop Joseph W. Corrigan. The Catholic Uni- versity of America Press, Washington, D. C. Long- mans, Green and Co., London, New York, and Toronto. $3.00. 8' x 51; ix + 302; 1941. To date it has been unavailing for students of an- thropology, sociology, etc. to point out the fallacies of the pronouncements on race superiority or inferiority. The general public is willing to concede that the others are not superior to us, but no one will accept the verdict that we are not superior to the others. The latest attempt to present an objective discussion of the race question is constituted by this book. Although it is interesting and contains the writings of eminent men, its effectiveness to influence public opinion must be doubted. One reason is that, with but two excep- tions, none of the authors actually deals directly with the main theme. Jennings provides an excellent sum- mary of genetics, Berger discusses briefly the inherit- ance of psychological traits, Moore presents a learned survey of animal psychology investigations, Hrdlicka outlines a classification of races, but only Lowie and Klineberg occupy themselves with the variation of certain traits among racial or national groups. Lowie examines and compares the cultural achievements and moral conduct of certain primitive groups, while Klineberg considers critically the results of intelligence tests made on several national groups. All the articles are praiseworthy but the last two are the only ones which seem pertinent to the theme of the symposium. THE COLOUR BAR IN EAST AFRICA. By Norman Leys. The Hogarth Press, London. 7s. 6d. 81 x 51; 160; 1941. That the Nazis are not the only offenders in the appli- cation of the philosophy of racial superiority in favor of their own people is well brought out in this book. It traces the history of the settlement of British East Africa, especially the two Rhodesias and Kenya, and the development of laws regulating property owner- ship, labor, taxation, and education. In the author's</page><page sequence="7">78 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY opinion the domination of the British minority is founded on the laws and regulations which tend to discriminate against the African. These regulations limit the independent economic opportunities of the natives and at the same time give educational, social, and political privileges to the white minority. This disparity [in educational opportunities] is de- fended on the ground of prestige, because at all cost the rise of a class of "poor whites" must be prevented. That means that a secure position in the ruling caste must be found for the stupidest man of European descent, but no place above the servile for the most gifted African. Ley reinforces his arguments by a generous use of references and citations on the effects of the "colour bar" in the conduct of agricultural and mining indus- tries and on the daily lives of the people. This is a thought-provoking treatise, whether or not the reader will agree with the author's viewpoint and suggestions for a solution of the problem. ESKIMOLAND SPEAKS. By William B. Van Valin. The Caxton Printers, Caidwell, Idaho. $3.50. 9 x 58; 242; 1941. In his seven years of missionary and educational work in Alaska, the author of this fascinating volume ab- sorbed much of the psychology, industry, and humanity of the Eskimos. Of no less interest to him was the beauty of the barren arctic wastes, the colorful pan- orama of the midnight sun, and the magnificent eeriness of the aurora borealis. As with all other white visitors, explorers, or mis- sionaries in the arctic, the writer is left amazed as well as awe inspired at the success with which life in the arctic (both human and infra-human) wrings from the brutal grasp of eternal winter the necessities for its sustenance. The Eskimos' ability to survive in such an adverse environment combines the keenness of the modern scientist, the foresight of the successful economist, and the stamina of the well-frained athlete. Fot those interested in polar life, this book will prove as thrilling as it is informative. TiE SOCIAL RELATIONS OF SCIENCE. By J. G. Crowther. Tke Macmillan Company, New York. $3.50. 8' x 51; xiii + 665; 1941. This book is an ambitious undertaking in which the author attempts to survey the scientific activities of man in prehistoric, classical, medieval, and modem times, in order to discover what social conditions are essential for the birth and growth of science. Science is regarded as a social product and the present-day need for an effective social policy for science is stressed. The material of the first two thirds of the book is es- sentially a descriptive historical formulation along conventional lines, with emphasis on the interde- pendence of social and scientific development. The last third of the book is devoted to a description of the distribution of present-day research facilities and a discussion of the social responsibilities of scientists. The style is somewhat didactic throughout. Referenc'es are given at the end of each chapter and there is an index. EAST AFRICA. By Elspeth Huxley. William Collins, London. 3s. 6d. 81 x 64; 48; 1941. This little volume by one who has had a long first- hand knowledge of East Africa makes interesting reading. It belongs in The British Commonwealth Series, a group of books designed to contribute to a better understanding of Great Britian and the British Commonwealth. The 12 colored plates of scenic views and 17 black and white illustrations of native life are well done, considering the low cost of the book. In the text Mrs. Huxley gives a clear picture of the many contrasting races to be found in this great region under British rule, where there are such wide diver- gences in religion, custom, and tradition, outlines the problems which the British Government has had to face in governing these people, and the manner in which these problems are being solved. Those familiar with the author's White Man's Country wil regret that the volume is so brief. TH1E STUDY OF MAN. University of Pennsylvania Bicentennial Conference, M-B. By Lawrence J. Henderson.

A future, second part of this monographic bibliography will deal with pathological and taxonomic studies on primates. In many branches of modern biology and medicine our simian cousins are rapidly replacing laboratory rodents and carnivores as experimental animals, a fact that is directly responsible for a large share in the tremendous recent increase in primatological literature. This scholarly bibliography is indispensable to all newcomers in primatology and will be particularly helpful in preventing repetition of work that has al- ready been accomplished. The author has faithfully indicated under each title precisely which species of primates has been dealt with. This alone should tend to eradicate that still prevalent and harmful habit, chiefly of medical writers, in stating: "in the monkey I found such and such a condition." With some 600 different species of recent primates and with at times far greater differences between some monkeys and others than between some and man, it is utterly useless to record any observation on "a monkey" without giving species, sex, and age. The carefully considered and detailed subdivisions of this bibliography are grouped under the major head- ings of anatomy, embryology, quantitative morphology, physiology, pharmacology, psychobiology, phylogeny, and "miscellaneous". Biology and medicine have been rendered a great service with this unique, practical, and excellently printed volume which forms a very essential part of a safe foundation on which to build in the future. A FIELD GUIDE TO WESTERN BIRs. By Roger T. Peterson. Houghton Miflin Company, Boston. $2.75. 7, x 41; xviii + 240; 1941. Most bird students already know Peterson's Field Guide to the Birds. The present volume is its counter- part for the western birds. Like its predecessor the object of the book is to enable the student to make field identifications of the birds by characteristic color patterns known as "field marks". To this end, the field marks are given emphasis in the illustrations. One must possess some knowledge as to the families of birds, but after this has been mastered, the descriptions point out the essential features for the identification of the species. Practically all species considered are illustrated, in part or in whole, either in black or white, or in color whenever the latter is more important than pattern for identification. The descriptions are further en- hanced by the inclusion of ranges of the species and the song of the bird whenever this feature is helpful, as in some of the flycatchers. It is to be regretted that the plates in many cases are not to be found close to the textual material. For instance, the plate of flycatchers is among the woodpecker descriptions and vice versa. Western fauna is very diversified and the number of geographic races is greater than in the East. The writer was hard put to meet this obstacle, but finally decided to list these forms in an appendix. In the few cases that the races can be separated in the field, the distinguishing characters are given in the text. There is no doubt that this handy pocket (overcoat size) guide will find as enthusiastic welcome in the West as the former book did in the East. Both to- gether will identify birds anywhere in the United States. ANDMAL BIOLOGY. Third Edition. By Michael F. Guyer. Harper and Brothers, New York and London. $3.75. 9' x 6; xix + 723; 1941. This text has been one of the leaders in its field for a decade. The new edition (cf. Q. R. B., Vol. 7, p. 361 and Vol. 12, p. 472 for mention of earlier editions) involves a number of changes designed to increase its usefulness. Numerous sections of the book have been rewritten, some condensed, and others expanded. New material presented includes a very important chapter on ecology, which provides the student with a concise review of the field, an account of the life and structure of planarians, a discussion of ameboid locomotion, and reviews of recent experimental work, especially that on "mating types" in Paramecium. In addition, the section on birds has been rewritten, and the classi- fication of mammals reorganized. A number of new illustrations have been added. The author presents the principles of biology in such a way as to retain the value of the usual "types" course, but the emphasis is upon fundamental concepts underlying all life phe- nomena. The well-chosen, clearly-labelled illustrations are a feature of the book. The volume is concluded with a list of reference books, a glossary, and a com- plete index. RETURN TO THE RIVER: A Story of the Chinook Run. By Roderick L. Haig-Brown. Illustrations by Charles DeFeo. William Morrow and Company, New York. $3.00. Limited edition, autographed by author and illustrator, $10.00. 8' x 5'; 248; 1941. This is the fascinating story of Spring, a Chinook salmon. It tells of her birth, her travels from the</page><page sequence="9">80 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Grand Coulee region to Puget Sound and the Pacific waters beyond, and her return at the age of five years to spawn and die in the same stream where she was born. Haig-Brown, a British-Canadian ichthyologist and author of the sourcebook Tke Western Angler tells the story of the life-cycle of the salmon in the vein of a novel, but without deviating from facts. The reflections of the old Senator, who was a witness of Spring's birth and death, offer sidelights on the salmon industry and on the use and misuse of natural resources, and conjectures on the possible effects of the completion of the Columbia River dam projects on the survival of the salmon in the Northwest. The illustrations by Charles DeFeo are unusually fine and a fitting accompaniment to the narrative. bAw WATCHING BrRDs. By James Fisher. Penguin Books, Harmondswortk, Middlesex, England; Penguin Books, Inc., New York. 25 cents. 7' x 4"; 192; 1940 (paper). A bird's eye view of the field of ornithology, its prob- lems, and its methods of study are contained in this little book. After introductory chapters to the class Aves, there follow chapters on migration, on the num- bers of birds, their habitats, their territory and breeding cycles, and their behavior. Although it would be impossible to treat all these subjects thoroughly in such a small amount of space, the review has been ably presented for the beginner. Since the writer is British most of the examples are taken from British birds, but the principles are the same for birds of any area. INSECTS AND THEIR STORI-S. By Harry HIoogstraal. With Camera Studies by Melvin Martinson and Drawings by Carl 0. Mohr. Thomas Y. Crowell Company, New York. $2.00. 71 x 91; 144; 1941. In this fascinating little volume are recorded, in lan- guage understandable to the high school freshman, the stories of some 50 of our common house, garden, and forest insects. The stories include observations on the everyday activities, the favorite haunts, the methods of resisting natural forces, and the methods of replenishing the races of both land and acquatic forms. The excellent photographic work of Martinson adds considerably to the interest and value of the book for budding naturalists. The volume is well indexed. An additional index and guide to the recognition of insects, arranged according to orders, is provided. BuTTERLIES. A Handbook of the Butterflies of the United States, Complete for the Region Nortk of the Potomac and Ohio Rivers and East of the Dakotas. By Ralph W. Macy and Harold H. Shepard. The University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis. $3.00. 9 x 6; vii + 247; 1941. The fact that no key to the Lepidoptera of the north- eastern United States has appeared since 1889 is ample reason for the preparation of this excellent work. In addition to the key to 162 species of Lepidop- tera, the present treatise includes many interesting details relating to the natural history, distribution, and economic importance of many of our northeastern forms. The volume is beautifully illustrated with both monochrome and dichrome photographs. The de- scription of each species begins with a list of publications relating particularly to that species. A complete index is appended. STUDIES ON GREGARINA BLATTARUM WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE CHROMOSOM E CYCLE. Illinois Biological Monographs, Volume XVIII, Number 2. By Victor Sprague. The University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Illinois. $1.00. 10' x 7; 144 + 6 plates; 1941 (paper). The present investigation deals principally with the period that involves syngamy and the meiotic phenom- ena of this most common and widely known of the Sporozoa. It also includes an account of the process of encystment and the development of the cyst. Five excellent plates and several figures elucidate the text. STUDIES OF THEE NEOTROPICAL COLUBRINAE. VIII.

An Introduction to the Nature and Work of Flowers and the Classification of Flowering Plants. Second Edition. By Raymond J. Pool. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York and London. $3.50. 9 x 51; xxiii + 428; 1941. The merited success of the first edition of this excellent text over the past twelve years has resulted in the issue of a second edition. The basic principle on which the entire book rests is the recognition of the plant as a living, working mech- anism. The work deals almost entirely with the taxonomic aspect of botany, and in line with this, emphasizes the family as the important unit in classifi- cation. The formula method in depicting the promi- nent floral features of the various families in the master chart (to which the key constantly refers) is known as the Besseyan system, and was originated by the author's former professor, the late Charles Edwin Bessey. While the main features of the present edition follow closely those of the earlier work, the present does include several notable changes. An entirely new chapter on the vegetative characteristics of flowering plants has been added, and changes throughout the text have been made to include the recent work in plant taxonomy. The text and key are well supplied with charts and illustrative material, both graphic and photo- graphic. Several concluding chapters deal with the history of plant taxonomy, and the collecting, preserv- ing, and mounting of herbarium specimens. A final chapter of reference books, monographs, manuals, and floras, a glossary, and an index conclude the volume. TiHE REDWOODS Of COAST AND SIERRA. Second Edition (Revised)X By James Clifford Shirley. University of California Press, Berkeley. $1.25. 91 x 6k; 84; 1940 (board). The first edition of this work appeared in 1937 (cf. Q. R. B., Vol. 12, p. 115). The revision does not markedly differ from the earlier version. It suffers from a peculiar diffuseness of style, so that there is a good deal of repetition. Also, since the first edition appeared, the claim of the Sequoias to be the oldest living things has been seriously challenged twice by organisms of much humbler appearance-the cycads of New Zealand and certain single-celled plants ob- tained from the interior of rocks of geological age. Both of these seem to be entitled to the same serious consideration that the author gives to certain other long-lived plants that are not especially closely re- lated to the redwoods. Also, the claim to have the greatest diameter of any tree in the world has been made on behalf of the chestnut "Tree of One Hundred Horses" near Catania, which is associated with Napo- leon Bonaparte. And in 1909 the National Geographic Magazine published a photograph of a Eucalyptus with a diameter of 67 feet, and another still larger. Exaggerated statements as to the height of Australian eucalyptus trees may be safely discounted, but it is difficult to explain away a photograph. The reader of the work now under discussion is likely to be disap- pointed by the absence of any reference to these trees. Of course, in a book as brief as this one it is obviously impossible to include enough material to satisfy all readers. The author has assembled a great deal of information not readily available elsewhere, and his product is worthy of all the praise bestowed upon it in these columns when the first edition appeared. TEXTBOOK OF BACTERIOLOGY. Thirteenth Edition, Re- vised. By Edwin 0. Jordan and William Burrows. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia and London. $6.00. 9k x 5k; xii + 731; 1941. The success of the earlier editions of this standard textbook have established its worth in the scientific field. The present volume is, with minor exceptions completely rewritten and is constructed upon a some- what different basis than its predecessors. The most obvious manifestation of this change is the elimination of chapters devoted to the highly specialized applied fields, such as soil, industrial and dairy bacteriology, and the incorporation of parts of these, together with other old and much new material, in a lengthy chapter on bacterial physiology. The relation of bacteria to disease is also considered in its broad aspects. The subject of immunity has been completely reorganized and is considered in two chapters, the first of which discusses antigens and related material, while the second is devoted to specific resistance to infectious disease. Some of the new material in this edition includes sections on dental caries, the non-sporulating</page><page sequence="11">82 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY anaerobic bacilli, the pleuropneumonia-like organisms, the Rickettsiae, and graphical representation of the secular prevalence and seasonal incidence of the more important infectious diseases. The illustrations are well chosen and extremely well reproduced. The book has been carefully and extensively documented and a total of over 1400 references are given as foot- notes throughout the volume. A complete index concludes this excellent college and medical school text. MODERN FRUIT PRODUCTION. By Joseph Harvey Gourley and Freeman Smith Howlett. The Macmillan Company, New York. $4.50. 94x6.1;vii+ 579;1941. Since orcharding and fruit culture are assuming ever greater importance in American agriculture, it is not strange to find an increase in the number of good texts dealing with the technique and economic importance of fruit growing. After an introductory chapter on the economic aspects of the fruit industry, the. present text leads into a discussion of the fundamentals of physiology, mor- phology, soils, and chemistry as related to fruit plants and their ability to yield products of fine quantity and quality. Such broad topics as orchard sites and soils, the planning and setting of orchards, fertilizers and manures, pruning and propagation, harvesting, storing and marketing of fruits are discussed in considerable detail, yet free from the technical language which usually limits the use of good texts to the professional man only. An extremely fascinating and informative chapter on the origin and improvement of fruits has been included. Each chapter lists the literature cited in that chapter, and the volume is concluded by a 12-page detailed index. The work will be of exceptional value in the hands of students of horticulture as well as orchardists. PRINcrIPEs OF MICROBIOLOGY. By Francis E. Colien and Ethel J. Odegard. The C. V. Mosby Company, St. Louis. $3.00. 8' x 5; 444; 1941. This fine text fully justifies its boast of presenting something new in the field of microbiology. After a preliminary discussion of the history, the important men, materials, and techniques of bacteriology, the important pathogenes are discussed from the point of view of what they do, rather than what they are. Emphasis throughout the volume is placed on the importance of bacteriology in nursing and disease prevention, rather than as a subject for specialization. In consequence, the work will find wider use in the hands of student nurses, medical students, and public healthworkers, than in those of the specialized bacteriol- ogist. The text is well supplied with tables, charts, and photographic illustrations (both moiochrome and dichrome). A short list of references is appended to each chapter. A catalogue of the methods of preparing the various culture media, a suggested laboratory program including 21 units of work, a glossary, and a complete index conclude the volume. The excellence of the text is still further enhanced by the use of the new eye-tone paper. THE PLANT WORLD. A Text in College Botany. By Harry J. Fuller. Henry Hlolt and Company, New York. $3.25. 81 x 51; xi + 592; 1941. The author has prepared this college text primarily for use by students who are registered in elementary botany courses but who do not intend to continue with advanced work. The author believes that the primary objective of such a course, designed for cultural and general educational purposes should be the presenta- tion of the fundamental features of the structure, physiological activities, and reproduction of flowering plants. The textual material is divided into four main parts: the nature of plants and of plant study; the structure and physiology of flowering plants; a general discussion of the plant kingdom, including a very interesting and instructive presentation of plant diseases; and, finally, the distribution of plants in time and space. A summary is placed at the end of each chapter. The excellent illustrations and - colored plates are a distinguishing characteristic of the volume. The appendix contains a modem classification of the plant kingdom, a complete glossary, and an index. PRUNING TREES AND SHRUBS. By Ephraim P. Felt. Orange Judd Publishing Co., New York. $2.00. 7' x 5; 237; 1941. Felt, Director and Chief Entomologist of the Bartlett Tree Research Laboratories, presents in this book the conclusions of years of research and practical experience in the art of pruning trees and shrubs. Working in conformity to the laws of nature, trees and shrubs are adapted by pruning in such a way as to best serve the diverse human needs of present-day living. In clear, non-technical language the author gives the principles of pruning not only shade trees, but fruit trees, nut trees, flowering shrubs and hedges, woody vines, and small fruits, as well. Ninety-three illustrations serve to clarify the text. All through the book the impor- tance of training the tree while young in the way it should grow, is stressed.</page><page sequence="12">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 83 A REVISION OF MELANCONIS, PSEUDOVALSA, PROS- THECIrum, AND TITANIA.

Biodynamica, Normandy, Mis- souri. $2.75. 91 x 61; 162; 1941. This work is a discussion of asymmetry and dyssym- metry. By definition the first of these terms is made to apply to the arrangement of molecules in a structure, and the other to the arrangement of atoms in a mole- cule. Such structures can not be superimposed on their mirror images, to which they bear a heterostro- phic relation. The author's thesis is that in inert sub- stances either form of a heterostrophic pair can occur about as often as the other, but that in living organisms one form will always displace the other. This is reminiscent of a doctrine promulgated sometime ago, that if two species occupy the same niche in the en- vironment one of them will disappear. The theory seems borne out by the author's own experiments, but his bibliography of 21 pages covering over a century of investigation makes no mention of the pioneer work of Gulick on the Achatinellidae which have a different story to tell. Also, it contains only one item from the publications of Boycott, Diver, and their satellites on inverse symmetry. The work is stimulating, but much more experi- mentation is needed before the theory can meet with universal acceptance. FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPARATIVE EMBRYOLOGY OF THE VERTEBRATES. By Alfred F. Huettner. The Macmillian Company, New York. $4.50. 91 x 6; xiv + 416; 1941. It is obvious that the present volume is the product of long years of teaching experience. The clearness and order of the exposition are evidence of it. But, in addition, the author has for the major part provided original illustrations that actually reproduce the ob- jects seen and do not require, as is often the case, a tremendous effort of cerebration and a vivid imagina- tion. The subject matter is contained in 19 chapters of which the first four are devoted to an introduction to the subject, history of embryology, cell structure, and reproduction. A fifth chapter deals briefly with amphioxus. Chapters 6 to 8 describe the embryology of the frog, and chapters 9 to 15 that of the chick. These descriptions are accurate, detailed, and expressed with remarkable simplicity of style and language. The final chapters deal with mammals and man. There is an index but no list of references. Except for this omission, the present textbook satisfies the most exacting requirements. It will undoubtedly prove very popular for college courses. CYTOLOGY, GENETICS, AND EvOLUTION.

University of Pennsylvania</page><page sequence="13">84 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Press, Philadelphia. $2.00. 9 x 6; v + 168; 1941. This is a collection of papers by twelve of the most eminent biologists of the country. The topics covered concern a variety of approaches, techniques, and problems but all referring to the elements of the cell, their properties, and behavior. Space is not available to review the papers in detail but it is to be remarked that few symposia have produced such an aggregate ,of stimulating articles as we have here. One does not find the dull reexamination of well-known past ac- complishments nor- the repetition of textbook state- ments. The investigators represented are probing deeper into the fundamentals of biology and the student can find no more illuminating record of the advances being made or hoped for than the summary presented in this volume. HUmAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. By Nellie D. Millard and Barry G. King. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia. $3.00. 73 x 5; vii + 525; 1941. This book has been prepared for the use of nurses and certainly seems to be satisfactory for the purpose. Of course, it is elementary and this is particularly noticeable with reference to the style in which it is written. The exposition of the subject matter follows a rather novel style which deserves to be remarked. A functional approach has been employed. The description of each organ or organ-system is introduced by a discussion of its general functions, then the morphology, and finally the physiology of the structure is dealt with. Thus, the skeletal muscles are described as muscles which move "apart", for example, the femur, and they are arranged in opposing groups; flexors and extensors, adductors and abductors, instead of the usual grouping of muscles of the thigh. Many of the illustrations are original and commendable. THE PLAGIOSTOmE HYPOPHYSIS, General Morphology and Types of Structure. By Harry W. Norris. Obtainable from the Author, Grinnell, Iowa. 50 cents (paper); $1.00 (cloth). 10 x 61; 91; 1941. The hypophysis of the plagiostome fishes (herein to include all elasmobranch fishes except the Holocephali) has been investigated in this anatomical study. On the basis of 51 genera the writer concludes that the plagiostome hypophysis has no exact detailed homo- logue in other vertebrates. The lobes of the plagiostome hypophysis, however varied in size, shape, and situation, or in attachments and other relations to brain, saccus vasculosus, and cranial walls, always conform to the definite plagiostome hypophysial type. The anterior and interior lobes vary but little from species to species, but the ventral is highly variable in many ways. CYTOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON ENDAMOEBA BLATTAE. Illinois Biological Monographs, Volume XVII, Num- ber 4. By Paul A. Meglitsch. The University of Illinois Press, Urbana. $1.00. 10- x 64; 147; 1940 (paper). In this study on Endamoebe blattae a comparison of the results proceeding from the use of basic dyes and the Feulgen reaction were made in order to determine the relationship of basophilic ma- terial to nucleic acids, as demonstrated by the Feulgen reaction, throughout the life cycle up to the formation of the mature cyst, . . . As a result of the study, in addition to details of nuclear division during the trophic and cystic stages, it has been possible to ob- serve a cyclical variation in the quantity and distribu- tion of nucleic acid, as determined by the Feulgen test, correlated with the processes of nuclear division and encystment. Several unusual relationships be- tween the basophilic material and the nucleic acid- containing material have also been observed. Eight fine plates (91 figures) and a bibliography con- clude this careful study. THE PRINCIPAL NERVOUS PATHWAYS: Neurological Charts and Schemas with Explanatory Notes. Second Edition. By Andrew Theodore Rasmussen. The Macmillan Company, New York, $2.50. 11 x 83; ix + 73; 1941. In this second edition of very useful charts of the principal pathways of the nervous system the author has included well-established alterations which in- vestigative work in the field since 1932, the year of the first edition, has contributed. No basic changes in organization of the material or in the form of the charts have been made. The book should continue to prove helpful particularly to medical students. PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY NATIVE AFRiCAN MEDICINE with Special Reference to its Practice in the Mano Tribe of Liberia. By George Way Harley. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. $3.00. 91 x 6; xvi + 294; 1941. The author of this work was for many years a medical missionary in Liberia. The training which he received at the Kennedy School gave him an appreciative at- titude toward native culture, and a desire to study the</page><page sequence="14">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 85 medical practices of the natives from the standpoint of the student of folk-lore, as well as from that of the physician. The present volume is largely the result of his own observations among the medicine men of the Mano tribe, but it also contains a great deal of in- formation about native medical practices throughout Africa, which he acquired from the leading libraries of London during a year of sick leave. While in London he and his wife studied botany, and after returning to Liberia they assembled a herbarium of over 1000 species, of which more than 100 have definite thera- peutic value. The ability of the medicine men to recognize different kinds of diseases is remarkable, and although they know nothing of the functions of the organs in the human body, in a particular case they can generally locate with uncanny accuracy the organ that is ailing. Each illness has its own method of treatment, in which internal medicine, external applications, massage, exercise, and magical incantation play their part. The latter may be the result of superstition but more often it is for the purpose of distracting the attention of onlookers, so that the real treatment and specific medicine may remain the secret of the medicine man. That some of the drugs used are really efficacious the author does not doubt; he cites authentic instances of successful treatment by native witch doctors of cases which the white physicians had abandoned as hopeless. The knowledge of the correct treatment of specific diseases seems to have been acquired originally by the trial and error method, but today it is learned by joining one of the two great secret societies of Liberia-the Poro for men and the Sande for women. The initiation into these societies is laborious, painful, and expensive. Having paid the price for entry the "zo" cannot afford to let the general public in on his means of gaining a livelihood. To retain the respect and confidence of his clientele, elaborate ritual and even, fraud are employed. The author describes treatments, some of them successful, which nevertheless were largely cere- monial. To draw the line between legitimate medicine and ceremonial magic is impossible. The two must be studied together. The ceremonial never injures the patient and the medicine may help, but the use of the blacksmith's tongs to restore a dislocated jaw bone seems slightly drastic. An appendix lists over 200 plants believed by the natives to be medically useful. In transliterating the native names the author has had recourse to letters and diacritical marks that do not occur in the English alphabet, and the reader who finds himself confronted by these strange symbols is likely to regret that there is no explanation of their meaning given. Such would improve the book, as would also a few more photographs similar to the lonely frontispiece. There is an index of 16 pages and a bibliography of 7 pages. SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES. A Study of the Programs Developed by the Health Department in Six Tennessee Counties. By Frank Walker and Carolina R. Randolph. The Commonwealth Fund, New York. $1.50. 9 x 5,; xi + 172 + 35 tables; 1941. For years school children all over the country have been receiving physical examinations of one sort or other, but only in a few places have any attempts been made to set up the organization for corrective work. In view of the findings of the selective service examinations the question arises as to the value of school health programs. This monograph provides a bit of information on the point. In Tennessee it is required that school children be examined every two years and apparently in some instances provision has also been made for corrective work-although what the actual arrangements are is not clear from this report. The authors have ex- amined the records of six selected counties to evaluate the effects of the program from 1930 to 1936. The main findings appear to be that twelve-year-old children in 1936 have less decayed teeth and diseased tonsils and better nutrition than the twelve-year-old children seen in 1930. Thus, it is assumed that some benefits have been obtained by the school health program even though with respect to visual defects no change in prevalence is noted. It is particularly significant to learn that only about 33 percent of dental defects, about 4 per cent of throat defects, and 12 per cent of visual defects are corrected after any examination, and that repeated examinations do not apparently increase the frequency of correction. Unfortunately, the data on which the report is based are defective in many respects and, therefore, the value of the findings is considerably limited. VERHANDLUNGEN DER DEUTSCHEN GESELLSCEAFT FUR KREISLAUNFORSCHUNG. XIII.\ Tagung zu Wies- baden vom 6. Mai 1940. Hauptthema: Kreislauf und Atmung. Edited by Eb. Koch. Theodor Steinkopff, Dresden and Leipzig. RM. 10 (in Germany); RM. 7.50 (outside of Germany). 9i x 54; xxxii + 182; 1940 (paper). References, contributions, and speeches of the German Society for Circulatory Research are embodied in this volume. The opening pages give a statement of the purpose of the association, the proceedings of the pre- vious meeting, and the opening report to the group. In all, there are twenty-two papers presented, with the principal discussions which followed each report. The first gives a general review of studies on circulation and respiration, not as isolated works, but in an effort to combine the various aspects of the two functions into a unified whole. The second paper emphasizes</page><page sequence="15">86 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY the clinical applications of studies on circulation and respiration, especially lung collapse therapy. The chemical control of the mutual interrelation between breathing and circulation is then discussed. Some of the more important of the remaining papers concern the clinical aspects of silicosis in its effects on cardiac insufficiency, the effect of anoxemia produced by high altitude flying or experimental low oxygen concentra- tion, lung ventilation and circulatory insufficiency in conjunction with certain related pathological con- ditions, experimental studies on circulatory collapse due to heart infarction, investigation of peripheral circulation by means of ultra red light, and electro- cardiographic studies among twins. Most of the papers contain very good photographs, diagrams, and bibliographies. The volume itself is concluded with an index of authors and subjects. BLuTDRUcKMEssuNG IJND KREISLAuF IN DEN ARTERiEN DES MENSCHEN. Geschichte und heutige Lage der Problente neue Ldsungsversuche. By Elenrich von Recklingha6usen. Theodor Steinkopj, Dresden und Leipzig. RM. 30.00 (outside Germany). 91 x 6x; xx + 532; 1940 (paper). The early pages of this volume discuss the historical development of methods used for the measurement and recording of blood pressure and pulse curves. Dia- grams of the various types of apparatus are given and results of the observations are critically discussed. Particular attention is paid to the findings upon which the step-curves are built up. Two principal types are described in detail, the pulse amplitude step-curve and the pulse form step-curve. The author next takes up the mathematical and graphic analysis of the pulse wave and the dynamics of arterial circulation, describ- ing at some length the alterations which occur in the various components of the wave as it progresses to different points along the arteries. The significance of these findings for the practical determination of blood pressures by direct and indirect methods, and also the application to certain clinical conditions is thoroughly treated. A fourteen-page summary covers the general information in the text, but proper under- standing of such details as the systolic and diastolic criteria can be obtained only by reference to the text itself. Several tables at the end of the volume outline the criteria used by various observers, summarize the mathematical formulae, and show in brief the principal hemodynamic principles. There is an ade- quate bibliography and a good index. FAMLY FOOD CONSUMPTION AND DIETARY LEVELS. Five Regions. U. S. Deparotnent of Agriculture, Miscellaneous Publication No. 405.

Govern- ment Printing 0fce, Washington. 35 cents. 91 x 5k; vi\ + 393; 1941 (paper). FA1 LY EXPENDITURES FOR HOUSING AND HOUSEEIOLD OPERATION. Five regions. U. S. Department of Agriculture, Miscellaneous Publication No. 432. Con- sumer Purchases Study. Urban and Village Series. By Hazel Kirk, Day Monroe, Kathryn Cronister, and Margaret Perry. Government Printing Office, Wash- ington. 25 cents. 9k x 51; v + 244; 1941 (paper). The first of these publications presents information on the food of farm families at different income levels in the 66 counties surveyed. The relationships between income and family composition, consumption of differ- ent types of food, and nutritive value of farm family diets are some of the topics discussed. The second publication, dealing with expenditures for housing and household operation of families living in villages and small cities, but excluding relief groups, foreign-born, one-person and broken families, and Negroes, except in the Southeast where they were studied as a separate population group, gives interesting comparisons between the patterns of the spending of home owners and of renters. Both volumes include the statistical data on which the studies were based. FATAL PARTNERS: War and Disease. By Ralph H. Major. Doubleday, Doran and Com- pany, New York. $3.50. 9 x 6; ix + 342; 1941. The course of history has often been profoundly changed by disease even more than by the outcome of wars. Some of the mightiest armies have fallen before typhoid, typhus, or bubonic plague, and have been scourged by scurvy. For the many centuries during which the sword and spear were the chief weapons and seige the established method of warfare, these diseases were the principal enemies of soldier and civilian alike. Later, progress in medical science largely eliminated the danger of such epidemics, and still more recent advances have almost banished malaria and yellow fever from the causes of fatalities. However, other grave medical problems have arisen consequent upon the use of explosives and mechanization of armies. Major tells a fascinating story of the companions in destruction, disease and war, from the days of the ancient Greeks to the present struggle. No war has been without some advance in medical knowledge, since wars serve as vast laboratories for testing dis- coveries made during times of peace. Although we still read of typhus in some of the armies of the present conflict, and of trench fever in air raid shelters, the principal problems concern shell shock and treatment of</page><page sequence="16">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 87 infections. These, too, are yielding to advances in the study of psychiatry, to rapid ambulance service, and to chemical treatment. "The present war illustrates, more than any other war in the history of the world, that the science of saving life, as well as the science of destroying life, has made great progress." PAPERS OF WADE HAPTON FROST, M.D. A Contribu- tion to Epidemiological Method. Edited by Kenneth F. Maxcy. The Commonwealth Fund, New York. $3.00. 9i x 6; viii + 628; 1941. Wade Hampton Frost was a fine teacher and his pre- cepts have had a tremendous influence on the develop- ment of epidemiology in this country. His efforts were never directed towards the elaboration of theories, but, being what might be called a naturalist of crowd dis- eases, he stressed always the need for accurate observa- tions, simple and logical quantitative analysis, and above all, clear thinking. These attributes are in evi- dence in all of Frost's writings and particularly in the 20 papers which Maxcy has brought together and briefly discusses. The articles are grouped into five sections. The first two include reports on field investigations in which Frost himself participated at the beginning of his career. The third section includes the papers resulting from the studies on influenza and the common cold. The final two sections contain articles dealing in the main with the methodology of epidemiology. In a sense these are the most interesting inasmuch as they reveal Frost's broad conception of public health prob- lems, an outlook which has not yet been fully appre- ciated by the profession. A complete bibliography of Frost's writings is appended, and Maxcy has also con- tributed a short biographical note. AN INTRODUCTION TO MEDICAL SCIENCE. Second Edi- tion, Thoroughly Revised. By William Boyd. Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia. $3.50. 91 x 58; 358; 1941. Nurses and premedical students often find difficulty in combining their studies of anatomy, bacteriology, physi- ology, histology, and genetics into an integrated whole. These are often presented as apparently separate sub- jects, and each is highly complex in itself. This volume (for earlier edition, cf. Q.R.B., Vol. 12, p. 380) demon- strates how the several studies must be considered to- gether for attainment of an adequate understanding of medical problems. The first part deals with the gen- eral principles of circulation, inflammation, bacterial infections, parasitism, and natural resistance. The second, and major portion of the book, concerns the pathology of specific diseases presented, by and large, according to organ systems. The closing chapters con- sider practical application, preventive medicine, and the value of the nurse to the laboratory. Although the treatment of each section is necessarily brief, it is thoroughly understandable. The small pho- tographs are good, but the drawings are mostly inferior. The volume is well written, fulfills its purpose, and is adequately indexed. IMMUNITY AGAINST ANiMAL PARASITES. By James T. Culbertson. Columbia University Press, New York. $3.50. 9 x 6; viii + 274; 1941. Both the beginning and the more experienced student of immunity to the parasitic forms should welcome this very considerable contribution in a field of investigation not overly burdened with clear and concise published works. Essentially, researches of devious and diverse nature form the material basis of this book. Its value is further enhanced by the predominance of fact every- where-personal concepts and theories being practically eliminated. The textual material is presented in three parts: (I) Natural resistance and acquired immunity, in which natural and age resistance, requisites for im- mune response, parasites which elicit immunity, and mechanisms and demonstration of immunity are dis- cussed; (II) Immunity in specific diseases, including the amoebiases, leishmaniases, trypanosomiases, ma- larias, coccidioses, trematodiases, cestodiases, nemato- diases, and response to arthropods; (III) Applied immu- nity, describing the classification of and vaccination against parasites, and the diagnosis of parasitic infec- tion. Ably and coherently written, carefully and ex- tensively documented with over 1300 references, com- pletely indexed, and attractively printed, the volume wil prove very useful to the beginner, the trained investigator, and the practicing physician and veteri- narian alike. FUNDAMENTALS oF HEALTH: Its Development and Con- servation. Revised Edition. By T. Bruce Kirkpatrick and Alfred F. Huettner with the Collaboration of Clara Mae Taylor. Ginn and Company, Boston. $3.50. 8' x 53; ix + 595; 1941. The material included in the original edition of this text was based upon a systematic survey of the interests and requirements of university students. It was found that the students wanted and needed a knowledge of bodily structure, function, and development as a foundation upon which to build proper health habits and attitudes, and not a mere recitation of hygienic dogmas. After observing the reactions of several thousand students during the past eight years, the writers feel that their original convictions were sound. The present edition incorporates the more recent findings concerning embry-</page><page sequence="17">88 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY ology, nutrition, internal secretions, bacteriology, immunology, and public health. As in the original writing, there is a considerable amount of space devoted to the principles of evolution, heredity, development, the function of the various organ systems, and proper -health procedures for the maintenance of proper func- tion. The photographs and diagrams are of only aver- age quality, but there is an excellent list of selected readings. The volume contains a glossary and is well indexed. INFANTILE PARALYSIS. A Symposium Delivered at Vanderbilt University, April, 1941. By the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Inc., New York. $1.25. 9 x 6; v + 239; 1941. This book contains much informative material for physicians and health officers. The six lectures, by well-known specialists, approach the problem from as many different angles and embody all the recent knowl- edge concerning this disease. It is now recognized that there may be as many strains of poliomyelitis virus as types of pneumococci and that the disease differs in different species of susceptible animals. With the dis- covery of the virus in feces and sewage, a new lead has been given as to the way in which poliomyelitis is spread. The problem seems ta be growing in complex- ity but it is by no means insoluble, as this survey indi- cates. In addition to the sections on the history, etiology, immunology and serology, pathology and pathogenesis, and epidemiology of poliomyelitis, there is a chapter on treatment and rehabilitation of the pa- tient which will be extremely useful to physicians and nurses. A bibliography of 575 titles and an index are provided. THE PARASITES OF MAN IN TEMPERATE CLIMATES. By Thomas W. M. Cameron. The University of Toronto Press, Toronto. $3.00. 9 x 57; xi + 182; 1940. This work is based on a course of animal parasitology given in the medical school of McGill University. It is intended for the medical man who practises in the English-speaking temperate and sub-tropical zones. Only parasites which actually occur in North America or Great Britain are discussed in detail; those which may be introduced in patients from the tropics, but which cannot become acclimatized, are dealt with as briefly as possible, while odd, aberrant, or doubtful forms are omitted entirely. Since the volume is not designed for the student of tropical medicine or for the parasitologist or laboratory worker, the material has been selected to include only that required by the prac- titioner. The chapters deal with protozoa, helminths, leeches, and arthropods, with a final chapter on para- sitological technique. The bibliography has been reduced to a minimum and only monographic or similar works have been included. The book is enriched by appropriate illustrations and is indexed. PERSONAL HYGIENE APPLIED. Seventh Edition, Revised. By Jesse Feiring Williams. W. B. Saunders Com- pany, Philadelphia. $2.50. 7' x 5"; xvi + 529; 1941. A college textbook of proven leadership in its field. However, there is no reason why this book should be limited to school or college, since physicians, teachers, nurses, and social workers may safely recommend it to parents or patients in need of guidance for living. Some of the new material in this edition includes an up-to- date consideration of the vitamins, a simplified discus- sion of infection and immunity, a rewritten chapter on the endocrines, a revised consideration of the safety problem as it relates to the automobile, and a new dis- cussion of human heredity and its effects on the abili- ties and talents of the individual. The illustrations are especially praiseworthy. Questions and exercises and a list of selected readings are placed at the end of each chapter. The appendix provides a suggested list of topics for a term report, and a typical "true-false" test as given at Columbia University. A comprehen- sive index concludes this excellent textbook. Tim BODY FUNCTIONS: Physiology. By Ralph W. Gerard. John Wiley and Sons, New York. Chapman and Hall, London. $1.75. 8' x 58; xiii + 289; 1941. This book is one of a series (Wendt Science Series) designed to give the reader more than just a superficial survey of the sciences, but at the same time to avoid the burden of technical terms. Part one concerns the effectors and regulators of the body-muscles, nerves, internal secretions-and how they function. The second section deals with circulation, respiration, diges- tion, excretion, protective mechanisms, and reproduc- tion. The central nervous system and behavior are discussed in the closing chapter. Enough anatomy, histology, and biochemistry are presented throughout the pages to clarify the descriptions of functions, and numerous simple physiological experiments are de- scribed, assuring a thorough understanding of the prin- ciples involved. Each chapter is concluded with an excellent list of references, and the book contains a complete glossary-index.</page><page sequence="18">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 89 THE FuJRTIERANCE or MEDICAL RESEARCH. By Alan Gregg. Yale University Press, New Haven, Oxford University Press, London. $2.00. 8 x 53; ix + 129; 1941. The Director for the Medical Sciences of the Rocke- feller Foundation first attempts to define medical re- search, second to discuss the relations of institutions conducting or furthering medical research with each other-especially the relations between foundations and universities-and third, to give an insight into the qualifications and personality of the individual research worker. It is evident that the author is aware of the points of view of both the donor foundations and the recipient institutions. He gives a provocative discus- sion of the shortcomings of the present system of foundation organization and the distribution of grants for research purposes in the United States, together with suggestions for improvement. The book is based on the eighteenth series of Terry Lectures delivered at Yale University. THE COMPLETE WEIGHT REDUCER. By C. J. Gerling. With a Foreword by Winfield Scott Pugh. Harvest House, New York. $3.00. 8 x 52 246; 1941. This is in the nature of a handbook for the corpulent individual. In it will be found, under headings ar- ranged alphabetically, brief and easily comprehended discussions of types of food, popular diet systems, re- ducing menus, commercial products, reducing machines, forms of exercise-in fact, very nearly everything that quackery as well as sound investigation has produced for the guidance of those who find themselves with overweighted constitutions. Numerous frauds are exposed. The book is intended only for persons who have no chronic functional or organic disorder, and only for those adults, who, having a moderate degree of overweight, wish to reduce in a rational manner. There is no index to the volume but this is unnecessary with the arrangement of the material in dictionary form. X-RAY THERAPY oF CHRONIC ARTHRITIS. (Including the X-ray Diagnosis of the Disease). Preliminary Report Based on 100 Patients Treated at Quincy, Illinois. By Karl Goldhamer. With a Foreword by Harold Swanberg. Radiologic Review Publishing Co., Quincy, Illinois. $2.00. 9 x 54; 131; 1941. The chapter headings of this discussion on the x-ray diagnosis and treatment of chronic arthritis are as fol- lows: Clinical aspects and pathology of chronic arthritis; Roentgen findings in chronic arthritis; How do x-rays act in chronic arthritis?; What cases should be treated by x-rays?; Technique of treatment; Report of patients; Results; Conclusions. The author found that "The results of irradiation were good in almost all forms of chronic arthritis and were startling and decisive in some types." A list of 52 references is given but there is no index. BIOCHEMISTRY ANNUAL REVIEW OF BIOCHEMISTRY. Volume X. Edited by James M. Luck and James H. C. Smith. Annual Reviews, Inc., Stanford University P.O., Cal. $5.00. 84 x 6; xi + 692; 1941. The editors call to the reader's attention a serious impact of the war upon the Review, namely, the irregu- larity and delay in the receipt of many journals. "Al- most every article in the present volume has been sub- mitted by its author with apologies for the restrictions in content imposed by the unavailability of recent numbers of important journals." Another effect is upon the international character of the Review. It is expected, however, that in Volume XI, the international character will be more manifest than in Volume X. Twenty-four papers make up the volume. All of them are important for the biochemist, but the general biologist will also find a number that are of especial interest to him. The chapter on bioluminescence should not be missed. Others are on plant growth substances, spectrometric studies in relation to biology, mineral nutrition of plants, relation of soil and plant deficiencies and of toxic constituents in soils to animal nutrition. The two longest reviews are on hormones (52 pages) and water-soluble vitamins (48 pages). As is the custom, all papers are documented and the volume concludes with author and subject indexes. In the autumn of 1941 a cumulative author and subject index to Volumes I to X was published. Those possessing a full set of this valuable series are indeed fortunate. OUT OF THE TEST TUBE. Third Edition Revised and Expanded. By Harry M. Holmes. Emerson Books, Inc., New York. $3.00. 9 x 6; 305; 1941. To the average intelligent layman, the field of chemistry represents one of the most appealing and revealing of all the subjects under investigation by modern scientific man. The present volume (cf. Q. R. B., Vol. 12, p. 495 for earlier edition) makes a very real and very definite contribution to the chemical education of the general reader. This excellent popularization represents the efforts of an expert in writing a simple, straightforward, and up-to-date account of the marvels of chemistry and the effect of these on our everyday lives. A few of the more interesting of the forty-odd chapters are con- cerned with: the importance of high vacua; hydrogen- the lightest substance known; oxygen-the elixir of life;</page><page sequence="19">90 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY chemical warfare; atom smashing; silks and cellulose; fuels and smoke; chemistry and the motor car; chemis- try of foods and nutrition; chaining the sun; the chemist in crime detection; the farm as a factory; what trans- portation owes to the chemist; minerals and world power; and the house of the future. The concluding chapter on strategic raw material is especially timely. The book is indexed and contains over one hundred striking illustrations. It is heartily recommended to all those who have an acute and healthy interest in the life of modern man and who wish to keep abreast of the contributions of chemical science to the comfort and convenience of living in the twentieth century. POLAROGRAPHY. Polarographic Analysis and Voltam- metry. Amperometric Titrations. By I. M. Kolthoff and J. J. Lingane. Interscience Publishers, New York. $6.00. 9 x 5-; xvi + 510; 1941. A presentation of a thorough and critical assay of the theory, then of the practice, of the polarographic ana- lytical method so far developed. The delicacy, extreme range, and the automatic nature of the method avail- able make it of great value for all analysts-inorganic, organic, or biological. To be used, polarographic analysis must be well understood. The present volume goes far in its effort to explain the "ins and outs." Fol- lowing this explanatory part, detailed nmethods of analysis are presented for many elements-complex salts, organic radicals and compounds, cancer tissues, etc. An important part of the text is the critical review of the literature through December, 1940. The appen- dix, which contains a table of potentials of common reference electrodes, and one of half-wave potentials of inorganic substances, and a chart of half-wave poten- tials of common inorganic substances in various sup- porting electrolytes, can be purchased separately. Author and subject indexes conclude the volume. PLANT GROWTH SUBSTANCES. Their Chemistry and Applications, with Special Reference to Synthetics. Second Edition, Revised. By Hugh Nicol. Chemical Publishing Company, Brooklyn, N. Y. $2.00. 82 x 5a; xii + 148; 1941. The first edition of this book was devoted almost en- tirely to the chemistry of substances, mainly synthetic, that produce, control, or regulate the growth of plants. Some physiological aspects are included in the present edition. When the book was first published the prin- cipal application of synthetic substances had related almost entirely to the treatment of cuttings. Recent work in the treatment of seeds and in grafting has now been included. Although the vitamins B (thiamin) and C (ascorbic acid) have been discovered to be potent growth regulating substances when applied to plants, there is little discussion concerning these except by indication of the most important studies. Rather, more attention is devoted to the less publicized indole and naphthyl compounds. Author and subject indices are provided. DIE METHODEN DER FERMENTFORSCHUNG. Lief- erung 8. Edited by Eugen Bamman and Karl Myrback. Georg Thieme Verlag, Leipzig. R. M. 34.50 (outside of Germany). 11 x 8; 2589-3047; 1941 (paper). This is the last volume, with the exception of the bibli- ography which will appear separately, of the important series on biological compounds, and techniques and methods applicable to enzyme investigation. In it are described the distribution, purification, properties, and actions of aspartase, peroxydase, katalase, hydrogenase, catalytic systems of unknown actions such as RSSR- RSH, ascorbic acid, and quinonoids. CO2 assimilation by green plants and certain bacteria, N2 assimilation, antienzymes and various models of enzyme action are also discussed. The latter part of the volume deals with enzymes important to industry and to the clinic (in particular, those apparently specific in carcinomas), the trends of future work along these lines, and the pro- ductive fields which enzyme research is opening up. AN INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CmEmmSmy. Fourth Edition. By Roger J. Williams. D. Van Nostrand Company. $4.00. 81 x 53; xiii + 628; 1941. With justifiable pride the author points (in his preface) to the characteristics which have made this textbook so popular that it has gone through four editions and nine reprintings since 1927. Among the main features of the book is its logical exposition with emphasis on the relationship between organic and inorganic chemistry. For example, the ethers, esters, acyl halides, etc. are conceived and described as belonging to a group of acidic anhydrides with fundamental properties in com- mon. In this revision the necessary additions conse- quent to recent discoveries have been made, but on the whole the contents and style of exposition are the same as those of the previous editions. There can be no doubt that the book will retain its high position as a college textbook.</page><page sequence="20">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 91 SEX CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS ON THE GENITAL FUNCTIONS AND THEiR HORMONAL REGU- LATION. By Bernhard Zondek. The Williams &amp; Wilkins Co., Baltimore. $4.50. 9 x 53; xxiv + 264; 1941. In this volume are brought together a series of reports on the author's work in Palestine since 1935. The investigations have covered a wide field but the results are all of interest to the general biologist as well as to the endocrinologist. There is a report on the occur- rence of some extrogenic substances in nature-in the waters of the Dead Sea, among other places. The prob- lems studied may be classed under two general groups. The first deals with the effects of the administration of extrogenic and androgenic hormones. Experiments and observations are reported with reference to the percutaneous application of the hormones-the morpho- logical and physiological changes produced by the dura- tion of the administration of the substances in varied dosages. The second group of studies contains the findings related to the menstrual cycle and its mecha- nism. The author outlines his hypothesis on the mechanism of menstruation which in his view is pro- duced "by harmonious action of the gonadotropic and ovarian hormones independently of the ovum." Much of the work summarized here is already known but the value of this volume is not diminished thereby, particu- larly since the author has attempted to integrate his own and the findings of others. One must remark and admire the experimental technique which, although sometimes open to criticism, reveals nevertheless the ingenuity and cleverness associated with Zondek's name. A bibliography of 269 titles and a summary of the work on the subject prior to 1935 are included. BIOMETRY STATISTICAL ACTIVITIES OF THE AMERICAN NATIONS. 1940. A compendium of the statistical services and activi- ties in 22 nations of the Western Hemisphere, together with information concerning statistical personnel in these Nations. Edited by Elizabeth Phelps. Inter American Statisti- cal Institute, Washington, D. C. $2.00. 9' x 6; xxxi + 842; 1941. This volume, prepared under the direction of the Tem- porary Organizing Committee of the Inter American Statistical Institute, has for its aim "to present a cur- rent account of the statistical services and activities of the American nations, together with a partial biographical list of the principal statistical personnel in those nations other than the United States." It is the outgrowth of the realization for some years past of the need to bring into closer relation the statisticians of the various American countries and to make them acquainted with the fact-gathering activities of these different countries and the publications that are the outgrowth of such activities. Each one of the 22 American republics is represented in a series of descriptive papers. These are summarized both in the language of the country and in English. The articles cover such topics as the system of official statistics, including a discussion of censuses and a list of the principal government agencies wvhich compile statistics; principal official serial statistical pub- lications; statistical educational facilities; statistical library facilities; statistical societies or associations; and principal non-official or semi-official statistical agencies and their serial publications. One of the important features of the volume is the Biographical Directory of Statistical Personnel which covers 58 pages. Three appendixes contain general information on Statistical sources, Notes on the statistical section of the Eighth American Scientific Congress, and the Inter American Statistical Institute. An excellent index completes the volume. STATISTICAL ATLAS OF SOUTHERN COUNTIES. Listing and Andlysis of Socio-Economic Indices of 1104 Southern Counties. By Charles S. Johnson and Associates: Lewis W. Jones, Buford H. Junker, Eli S. Marks and Preston Valien; Consultants: Edwin R. Embree and W. Lloyd Warner. University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill. $4.00. 10 x 7; x + 355; 1941. The sociological features of thirteen Southern states, by counties, are analyzed in this atlas. A great number of these features concern the educational characteristics of the areas, showing by race the expenditures per stu- dent percentage attendance, type and value of the schools, and per cent of illiteracy. The remaining features concern economic characteristics, including types of occupations, ownership and tenancy, order of major crops, and per capita wealth. From an analysis of these characteristics the counties have been classified into cultural types. It was found that geographical propinquity does not necessarily result in similar county types. This and other observations are briefly dis- cussed, most of which have long been known but have not been adequately expressed quantitatively. Though doubtful, it is to be hoped that the toil and expense of preparing this volume will be warranted. The informa- tion might prove of value to leaders in rural educational programs because of the close interrelationship between the school and the socio-economic conditions of the surrounding area. The bibliography contains approxi- mately 600 references.</page><page sequence="21">92 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY THE SECOND YEARBOOK OF RESEARCH AND STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY. Books and Reviews. Edited by Oscar Krisen Buros. The Gryphon Press, Highland Park, New Jersey. $5.00: Less ten per cent on orders sent directly to The Gryphon Press. 104 x 74; xx + 381; 1941. The second volume of this compilation is considerably enlarged. It contains reviews of 359 books published in English since 1933, of which 125 appeared in the first volume (noted in Q. R. B., Vol. 14, p. 378). The reviews have been culled from 283 journals. Unques- tionably a useful source of information, this yearbook is also entertaining, and sometimes embarrassing for book reviewers. The editor would like to make the Yearbook an annual publication if funds could be ob- tained; otherwise it will remain biennial. Other and more ambitious changes are contemplated, including the review of articles as well as of books. The value of this proposal is doubtful. THE BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS. Vol- ume 4, Number 1, March, 1942. Edited by N. Rashevsky. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. This number contains the following papers: Diffusion as a Function of Aggregates in Colloidal Media, by Her- man Branson; A Theory of Steady-State Activity in Nerve-Fiber Networks: IV. N Circuits with a Common Synapse, by Alston S. Householder; A Kinetic Theory of Diffusion Forces in Metabolizing Systems, by H. D.

Illinois Biological Monographs, Volume XVIII, Number 3. By S. Charles Kendeigh. The University of Illinois Press, Urbana. $1.50. 104 x 7; 120; 1941 (paper). This exhaustive and valuable study of the house wren is the result of 19 years of observation of 142 male and 147 female wrens on a 15-acre estate. The results make it obvious that an intensive directive study reveals many facts otherwise not ascertained in casual field observation. Adult males that have previously nested almost in- variably return to the same territory that they formerly occupied, or they establish a new territory adjacent to it. The return of adult females to their former nesting areas is almost as regular. The female does not defend territory or recognize the limits of territory as estab- lished by the male. When the female appears confined to a territory, it is due to her nest-box being centrally located within the territory, to her being chased out of neighboring territories, or to the male's adjustment of the outlines of his territory to coincide with her movements. Territorial boundaries are frequently in a state of flux and rarely remain uniform throughout the season. These changes are caused by early arriving males at- tempting to take possession of very large territories, parts of which they are forced later to yield, to the impact of new males arriving and carving out territories, to variations in the activity and feeding areas of the female mate, to the shifting population of both males and females between the first and second breeding periods, and the necessity for remating. Territory is maintained throughout each breeding period and breed- ing season, although there may be some decrease in activity as nesting progresses. The non-breeding popu- lation of males varies from 28 to 35 per cent of the total male population and in the females from 13 to 20 per cent of the total female population. Except for the fact that only the male sings, sex recognition is based on differences in behavior of the two sexes. Later, there may be recognition of each other as individuals through characteristic mannerisms. Remating of a pair the following year occurred in 42 per cent of the cases where both birds of the pair survived and returned to the locality. Besides the conclusions derived from the writer's- observations, case histories of territories of individual males compiled during the course of this work are given "in order to make available to others the vast amount of information that accumulated at the Baldwin Bird Research Laboratory from 1914 to 1939."- DEVELOPMENTAL DIAGNOSIS: Normal and Abnormal Child Developmnent. Clinical Methods and Practical Applications. By Arnold Gesell and Catherine S. Amatruda. Paul B. Hoeber, Inc., New York. $6.50. 9' x 6Q; xiii + 447; 1941. A series of publications on the pioneer work of Gesell and his co-workers has preceded this book. Develop- mental Diagnosis, which is destined to become a classic, has the advantage over these earlier books in that it is much more inclusive as regards subject matter. It also gives the most concise and workable presentation to date of the Gesell clinical testing material. In the preface Gesell states that: Observations of normal behavior threw light on malde- velopment; and the deviations of development in turn helped to expose what lay beneath a deceptive layer</page><page sequence="22">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 93 of "obviousness" in normal infancy. We have come to sense the identity of the developmental processes which in equal measure determine the reaction pat- terns of the intact and the defective child, the well endowed, the partially endowed, and those blemished by injury and disease. It is these deep, determining developmental processes which must inevitably come within the scope of clinical medicine. In preparing this volume we have had much in mind the medical student who in private or public capacity will soon be confronted with varied and exacting problems which concern the developmental welfare both of normal and abnormal children. From a study of the genesis and growth of patterns of behavior Gesell has been able to formulate concrete norms of maturity which have been given thorough practical tests and have proved dependable "not only in the study of normal variations of development, but in the diagnosis and supervision of pediatric, neurological and psychiatric conditions." The emphasis throughout the book is on diagnosis. In the first section the basic principles and methods are first outlined and the nature of behavior and of mental growth discussed. Chapter III, by far the longest in the book, is the most basic in that it "integrates the developmental tests, the behavior characteristics, and the growth trends of the behavior patterns for the period from 4 weeks to 3 years. This chapter is or- ganized for convenient reference and is illustrated with over a hundred photo-tracings of normative behavior patterns." Part II, dealing with defects and deviations of development, discusses problems of differential diag- nosis, amentia and retardation, amentia of high grade, low grade amentia, endocrine disorders, convulsive dis- orders, the neurological diagnosis of infant behavior, cerebral injury, special sensory handicaps, prematurity, precocity, environmental retardation, and clinical aspects of child adoption. Part III is concerned with the protection of early child development-diagnosis and guidance and development supervision. Four ap- pendices give details concerning technique, charts, equipment, and cinematic case studies. The volume is provided with an excellent working index. BASIC PROBLEMS OF BEHAVIOR. By Mandel Sherman. Longmans, Green and Com- pany, New York, London and Toronto. $3.00. 8' x 58; vi + 440; 1941. Many books concerned with personality and adjustment suffer from an excess of clinical evidence and a lack of scientific fact. This book, an elaboration of the author's Mental Hygiene and Education (1934), demonstrates that, in the investigation of problems of behavior, clini- cal and experimental evidence can be brought together with successful results. This alliance is accomplished by the selection of suitable experiments from the huge amount of psychological literature, and practical illus- trations furnished from clinical data. The opening pages present a systematic discussion of emotion as a foundation for the following chapters on motivation and frustration (including experimental neurosis), person- ality, adjustment mechanisms, attitudes, conflicts, neu- rosis, and mental abnormalities. A valuable chapter on delinquent behavior discusses current theories of the psychogenic basis, personality, and treatment of this problem. Gathering together as much data as it does, this book should prove valuable for reference as well as for use as a text, and may well encourage a closer association between psychologist and psychiatrist, as the author suggests. One might wish a more critical treatment of personality tests and procedures used in measuring attitudes. A 16-page bibliography and index are included. BREATHING CAPACITY AND GRiP STRENGTH OF PRE- SCHOOL CHILDREN. University of Iowa Studies in Child Welfare, Volume XVIII, Number 2. By Eleanor Metheny. University of Iowa Press, Iowa City, Iowa. $1.35 (paper): $1.70 (cloth). 91 x 61; 207; 1940. This investigation is designed to study the possible relationship of breathing capacity and grip strength to health and physical condition. Until now data con- cerning this problem in preschool children have been scarce. Special spirometers and dynomometers were constructed suitable to the physical requirements and need for special motivation of the children. Complete information was obtained concerning anthropometric measurements, intelligence scores, health and fatigue ratings, sex, and age. In the analysis of data on ap- proximately 200 children the intelligence quotient was found to be unrelated to either grip strength or breath- ing capacity but height was most highly correlated with both factors. It is doubtful that breathing capacity is related to health of preschool children, but on the aver- age the children with higher physical condition ratings had greater grip strength. The material suggests that the latter variable may be related to the run-down condition preceding a cold. This careful study justifies further investigation of grip strength as a functional test for children. A BEHAVIOR STUDY OF THE COMMON TERN (STERNA HIRUNDO HIRUNDO L.). Proceedings of the Boston So- ciety of Natural History, Vol. 42, No. 1. By Ralph S. Palmer. Society of Natural History, Boston, Mass. $1.00. 9 x 6; 119 + 14 plates; 1941 (paper).

The author's careful field observations extending over several years in the terneries at the Sugarloaf Islands off Sagadahoc County, Maine, are herein set forth with an excellent measure of scientific exactness and clarity. The detailed behavior of the tern from the time of its arrival at the ternery, through the mating, brooding, and rearing seasons, makes up the greater portion of the report. Notes on the require- ments for a successful tern colony (isolation, food, and cover), the economic importance of the bird, as well as a list of its predators are included. The report con- cludes with an extensive bibliography, several charts, and a number of plates depicting the habitual activities of the tern. SCMIZOPHRENIA IN CHILHOOD. By Charles Bradley. The Macmillan Company, New York. $2.50. 8 x 5f; vii + 152; 1941. As indicated by the title, the subject matter of this book is concerned with the schizophrenic reaction as it is seen in children. In the first three chapters the au- thor gives a brief but appropriate summary of the de- velopment of the present-day schizophrenic concept through the influences of Kraepelin, Bleuler and Meyer. The viewpoint from which the remainder of the book is written seems to emphasize the "disease entity" rather than the "reaction type" concept, and the value of the book as a contribution to the literature is correspond- ingly weakened. Indicative of the contents and organi- zation of the material are the chapter headings: Inci- dence, Symptomatology, Course, Types, Etiology, Psychopathology, Laboratory Findings, Anatomical Pathology, Diagnosis. The author leans to a constitu- tional basis, with secondary, precipitating situation fac- tors as causative agents. The treatment is descriptive rather than dynamic. There is a bibliography of 118 titles. Subject and author indices are included. A NEW TEST FOR THE DETECTION OF COLORBLINDNESS. By P. B. Wiltberger. College Book Company, Colum- bus, Ohio. $8.00. 9 x 6; 22; 1941. Many people who are classified as colorblind by the usual tests are not truly colorblind but have varying degrees of weakness in color perception. The writer of this bookobjectstotheuse of such tests for this andother reasons. He recommends the use of color "chips," or rectangles, on which the subject fixes for a short period of time. Upon shifting the fixation point the normal person (or a person who is only color weak) sees the complimentary color after-image, whereas the totally colorblind person sees a white rectangle. The book contains a brief description of the physi- ology of color perception, directions for administration of the test, and several pages of color "chips." For some purposes this method may be useful, but in gen- eral people who administer tests of color perception are interested in detecting color weak individuals as well as those who are totally colorblind. SOCIAL CASE RECORDS FROM PSYCHATRIC CLINICS with Discussion Notes. By Charlotte Towle. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $3.00. 9 x 51; xii + 455; 1941. This book has been written primarily for use in the author's classes in psychiatric social work at the Uni- versity of Chicago. The organization of the material is, accordingly, for usefulness in study and discussion. In a nine-page introduction the author formulates in con- cise and lucid form the general conceptual background against which the present-day psychiatric social worker operates. The remainder of the book is devoted to a presentation, in detail, of psychiatric social worker con- tacts with nine separate cases. The presentation of each case is followed by discussion notes and a pertinent list of references. There is an index. This book is recommended as an authoritative and practical con- tribution to its field. CHILD PSYCHOLOGY: Child Development and Modern Education. Edited by Charles E. Skinner and Philip L. Harriman. With the Collaboration of Amy F. Arey, L. A. Averill, Lorin E. Bixler, E. A . Bond, J. W. Charles, and Others. The Macmillan Company, New York. $3.00. 81 x 512; xii + 522; 1941. A symposium of the general subject of child psychology. Fourteen different contributors are included. The gen- eral plan is a presentation of the problems of child psy- chology and a description of the methods employed in the scientific study of children. Throughout, the nor- mal child is regarded as an integrated, growing per- sonality. The book is well set-up and organized and the material is lucidly presented. Lists of references follow each chapter. In an appendix a brief, compre- hensive outline of each chapter of the book is given. There are subject and author indices. MENTAL HYGIENE IN EDUCATION. By Ernest W. Tiegs and Barney Katz. Ronald Press Company, New York. $2.75. 8 x 54; xiv + 418; 1941. A mental hygiene book for teachers, administrators, supervisors and students of psychology. The material is presented in three parts: Part I. The nature and</page><page sequence="24">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 95 origin of personality difficulties; Part IL. Improving personal and social adjustment; and Part III. The more serious personality difficulties. The scope of the mate- rial is broad and the aim of the authors commendable, but the treatment inevitably reflects the doctor of phi- losophy rather than the doctor of medicine, and is academically descriptive rather than dynamic. It is doubtful whether the book will prove a practical guide in handling the personality problems of school children. A list of references follows each chapter and there are author and subject indices. bw VIsIoN. A Study of its Basis. By S. Howard Bartley. With an Historical Perspec- tive by Edwin G. Boring. D. Van Nostrand Company, New York. $3.50. 8' x 51; xv + 350; 1941. A handbook on the psychophysiology of vision. The author presents material selected from the psychology of vision for which present day neuro-physiology has something to offer, and discusses certain related visio- sensory phenomena for which physiology must provide an answer. Aspects of vision touched on are indicated by some of the chapter headings: Forms of brightness discrimination, Entoptic stray light, Repeated stimula- tion, Flicker, Perception of movement, Neural inter- action, Contour, The electroretinogram, The optic- nerve discharge, The cortical response. References are appended to each chapter, and there are name and subject indices. JUVENILE DELINQUENCY: A Comparative Study of the Position in Liverpool and England and Wales. By J. H. Bagot. Jonathan Cape, London. 5s. 82 x 52; 93, 1941. This book presents the first of a new series of studies of social problems issued from the Division of Statistics in the Social Science Department of the University of Liverpool. The study is designed to throw light on the question of why the trend of juvenile delinquency is beginning to soar again with the advent of the present war. The study consists of a comparison of the position in Liverpool, England and Wales, and is based on detailed analysis of records of juvenile delinquency. The conclusions and recommendations are summarized in one of the final chapters. ANXIETY AND ITS TREATMENT with Special Reference to Alcoholism. By John Yerbury Dent. John Murray, London. 3s. 6d. 73 x 4Z; 124; 1941. This is a consideration of the problem of alcoholism viewed as a symptom of an underlying anxiety. How- ever, the author writes from the viewpoint which is of doubtful helpfulness and accuracy, that anxiety is essentially a chemical and physical manifestation rather than a manifestation of personality malfunction. Alcoholism is regarded as a chemical disease. One chapter is devoted to vitamin B deficiency. In another the treatment of addiction by apomorphine is described. PARs PRo ToTo. Ein Beitrag zur Pathologie Mensch- licher Affekte und Organfunktionen. Schriftenreihe zur Deutschen Medizinischen Wochenschrift, Herausgegeben von R. Siebeck and V. v. Weizsicker, Heft 5. ByRudolf Bilz. Georg Thieme Verlag, Leipzig. RM. 9.75 (outside of Germany). 8k x 5k; 318; 1940 (paper). The author offers in this treatise a biologically oriented contribution to the pathology of human emotions and organic functions (neuroses). The investigation will interest all students of the "mind-body" problem, par- ticularly biologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists. DE OMNIBUS REBUS ET QUIBUSDEM ALIIS NATURAL HISTORY AND THE AMERIcAN MrND. By William Martin Smallwood in Collaboration with Mabel Sarah Coon Smallwood. Columbia University Press, New York. $4.25. 9 x 6; xiii + 445; 1941. This is a pioneering work. Within the past few years a number of biographical works dealing with the natu- ralists of America have appeared, but this is the first one to focus its emphasis exclusively on the effect of their lives and work on contemporary and subsequent thought The men and women whom the authors have selected for special attention are not by any means the greatest, but those whom they consider to be the most significant: those who occupy not the mountain passes but the cross roads on paths to knowledge. Therefore, the personnel discussed in a work of this sort is largely a matter of opinion, and the present reviewer feels that the omission of Robert Chambers, whose Vestiges of Creation prepared the way for Darwin is very definitely a defect. Certainly Chambers through his influence on Darwin has affected later scientific thought as much as, if not more than, that other pre-Darwinian evolutionist, Rafinesque, whose erratic figure appears and reappears throughout the pages of this book. And the treatment of Amos Eaton seems somewhat out of proportion when compared to, for instance, that accorded Agassiz. Except for such instances, however, the selection of personnel is above criticism. There is practically no naturalist who lived in the United States prior to 1850 who is not mentioned in the pages of this work. Some-</page><page sequence="25">96 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY times the notice seems inadequate. For example, Charles Alexandr6 Lesueur is mentioned because he made the drawings for Godman's Natural History, thus setting a new standard for scientific illustration. Noth- ing is said about his romantic career with the ill-fated expedition of La Perouse, of which he was the only member to escape the destruction which overtook it. Neither is anything said about Lesueur's systematic work on pelagic mollusca, and only the briefest possible mention is made of his part in the establishment of the intellectual capital of the United States at New Harmony. Again, John Bartram receives a great deal of atten- tion, which of course he merits, but nothing is said about his spectacular discovery of Franklinia. But of course, if the authors had attempted to please all their potential readers (whose name should be Legion) they would have produced a work the size of the Cambridge Natural History. The chapter dealing with the sixteenth and seventeenth century writers was an eye opener to this reviewer, as was also the story of Jane Cloden of the eighteenth century, who was the first woman to take up any kind of scientific activity. Perhaps the most original, and hence the most impor- tant chapter, is that dealing with the manufacturers of scientific instruments. We all use microscopes, but what do we know about Spencer, Tolles, Gronow, and Zentmayer? How many who use Spencer instruments know that at the age of sixty Spencer lost his entire plant, stock, and records in a fire, and then proceeded to set the entire world an example of courage and hero- ism by starting over again from scratch, five years later winning a gold medal at the Paris exposition? To the authors of this work America means only the Atlantic seaboard of the United States. This example of inverse synecdoche leads them to repeat the popular error that the Museum of the Library Association in Charleston, South Carolina, was the first to be estab- lished in America. As a matter of fact, the Natural History Museum established by Kino at Matape, Sonora, antedated that at Charleston by more than a century. Also, the authors' contention that American culture originated on the Atlantic seaboard can hardly be maintained, for when Harvard was founded in 1638 there were at least four universities on the Pacific slopes of Latin America, one of which at Leon, Nicaragua, had been in operation since 1523. A more adequate index and a chronological table would have added to the efficiency of the work, as would have better documentation. But despite these criti- cisms the book is truly monumental and deserves uni- versal circulation. THE ROAD OF A NATURALIST. By Donald Culross Peattie. Houghton Mifflin Com- pany, Boston. $3.00. 9 x 5i; ix + 315; 1941. Not since the publication of The Desert and The Moun- tains has the present reviewer come across a more beautifully expressed appreciation of nature than this work by Peattie. Like Van Dyke, Peattie understands the truth of the statement of a late philosopher, that "There is more real beauty in what science has to tell us of the chemistry of a distant star, or of the life history of a protozoon, than in any cosmogony produced by the creative imagination of a pre-scientific age." Both Van Dyke and Peattie give free rein to creative imagina- tion, but both confine their statements to what science can reveal to us about the natural countryside. Here the resemblance ceases. Van Dyke is an art critic, Peattie is an artist. Instead of the impersonal and objective attitude of Van Dyke, Peattie is personal and subjective, and identifies himself with the desert and the mountains that he loves. In his case the antithesis between man and nature does not exist. Like the child in one of Kipling's Just So stories, he fades away into the landscape, and becomes part of nature. The man- tle that has fallen upon his shoulders is not that of Van Dyke, but that of William Bartram, that gentle soul of an earlier century, who was so distressed by the cumber and entanglement of a war torn world that he retired to the wilderness to commune with nature and nature's God. Peattie is not inspired by the desert so much as by the feelings which it evokes within him. His poetic descriptions alternate with meditations of an intimate nature upon the deeper things of life, which will be found comforting by those who have endured the same sorrows, and there are many such, but they are not articulate and we seldom hear about them. The world has great need today of the mystic vision. It must be a great satisfaction to the author to know that he is helping to meet this need. RESEARCH-A NATIONAL RESOURCE. II.-Industrial Research. December, 1940. Report of the National Re- search Couincil to the National Resources Planning Board. National Research Council. Government Printing Office, Washington. $1.00. 11i x 9; xi + 370; 1941 (paper). Under the direction of the National Resources Planning Board three surveys have been made concerning re- search as a national resource, not only in relation to the present defense effort but also to developments in the post-defense period. The first of these reports, on "Relation to Federal Government of Research," has been published. The third, "Business Research," is in preparation. The second, the present volume, has been prepared by 26 outstanding leaders in research. From a summary of the findings we note the following: Continuous and increasing application of science by industry is contributing most significantly to the high</page><page sequence="26">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 97 standard of American living. Viewed in this light industrial research is a major national resource.... American industry employs over 70,000 research work- ers in over 2,200 laboratories at an estimated annual cost, based on an average of figures reported, of the order of $300,000,000.... Industrial research is pos- sible for all industrial units, small and large.... Industry looks to the universities for trained technical men, and for principal advances on the frontiers of science.... There is opportunity for some American university to establish a comprehensive curriculum in applied mathematics. The number of men engaged in applied mathematics is comparatively small but their work is extremely significant. Recommendations, in summary form, are also made to industry, to labor and industry, and to the Govern- ment for the further extension of research in industrial fields. SCIENCE versus MATERIALISM. By Reginald 0. Kapp. Methuen and Company, Lon- don. lOs. 6d. 73 x 5i; 280; 1940. The author of this book is an engineer who seems, unfortunately, unfamiliar with the concept of integra- tion in human biology. He attempts to answer, to his own satisfaction, the question "Is matter the only reality?" His revival of the battle between science and religion and materialism and vitalism would seem to be an earnest battle against windmills. The book is divided into three parts: I. Clearing the ground; II. Double determinateness; and III. The material universe. By circuitous routes he clears his mind by resorting to the dichotomy of living and lifeless substance (i.e. organic vs. inorganic) and asserting that living sub- stance is subject to a double set of restrictions, that its behavior is more determinate than that of lifeless sub- stance. This "double determinateness" is regarded as evidence for vitalism. Likewise, living substance is constructed to a "specification," i.e. is not merely the result of shaking down, as in crystal formation and other inorganic aggregates. Many references are made to the views of various biologists, philosophers, and physicists, both ancient and modern. It is felt that the puzzled reader will find little help in this exposition, and the causal reader little interest. PHOTOGRAPHC EMULSION TECHNIQUE. By T. Thorne Baker. American Photographic Pub- lishing Company, Boston. $4.00. 7T x 58; ii + 263; 1941. "This book is intended not only to be a guide to prac- tical emulsion making, but as a textbook for technical students, industrial chemists, and photographers gen- erally, who are anxious for their own reasons to prepare emulsions of various types and speeds." Although the range of commercially produced sensitized paper, glass, and film is wide, the photographer occasionally requires an emulsion outside of this range and in such a small quantity as to make commercial productiofi impossible. The writer thoroughly explains the technique of pre- paring emulsions, including selection of materials, labo- ratory layouts, coating, color, x-ray, ultraviolet, grain, speed, etc. For deeply involved amateur photographers, study and experimentation with emulsions provides a fascinat- ing hobby full of possibilities. For them this book may be recommended as an excellent guide. Yet a simple reading of these pages cannot but broaden the knowl- edge of those who depend entirely upon commercial products. Included are many references and a com- plete index. SOIL AND SENSE. By Michael Graham. Preface by Sir E. John Russell. Faber and Faber, London. 7s. 6d. 70 x 44; 274; 1941. The fertility of the soil is to agriculture what petrol is to a motor car-it is what keeps it a going concern. In this simply written and very understandable volume, Graham has brought out the fact that increased mecha- nization', with its counterpart, decreased animal popu- lations, has resulted in a serious strain on the fertility of the soil. This condition is further aggravated by the excessive and unwise use of cheap chemical fertilizers. In non-technical language, the author discusses the natural fertility cycle of the soil, as well as crop rotation, and the importance of grasses and legumes in maintain- ing soil fertility, and encourages the farmer to avail himself of the scientific tests now available to determine the needs o$ his soil, and to make up for the depletions with a good grade of chemical fertilizer. There is also a strong plea for landlords to assist tenants in supplying the needed fertilizer. Since the book is about British agricultural prob- lems there is little beyond the very broadest considera- tions which will be of value to the American farmer. A short list of references and an index are appended. THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION: Annual Report for 1940. By Raymond Fosdick. The Rockefeller Foundation, New York. Free. 81 x 5x5; xv + 473; 1941 (paper). In the first part of this report is given President Ray- mond B. Fosdick's review of the year's work of the Foundation. Then follow detailed reports for the dif- ferent divisions: International Health, Medical, Natu- ral and Social Sciences, Humanities, and Work in China. Appropriations for the year amounted to</page><page sequence="27">98 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY $9,854,497. Of this sum, 77 per cent was for work in the United States and 23 per cent for work abroad. Public health received the largest share, followed by the natural, social and medical sciences, humanities, and rural reconstruction in China, in the order named. The war curtailed the work in some of the European countries but appropriations went to 44 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The activities of the Foundation, extending into all fields of intel- lectual endeavor, represent wise and careful planning on the part of those who have the responsibility of disbursing the funds. The largest single appropriation went to the University of California for the construc- tion and housing of a giant cyclotron. By LIGHT OF SUN. By Elsie Symington. With Foreword by Richardson Wright: Woodcuts by Claire Leighton. G. P., Put- nam's Sons, New York. $2.00. 8 x 51; x + 196; 1941. Mrs. Symington's autobiography is the story of a sensi- tive woman's successful search for a way of living which would provide the widest scope for her physical and mental energies. Because the environment she sought turned out to be a special sort of house in a special sort of garden, the casual reader may be inclined to dismiss the work as just another garden book. It is a great deal more than that, for its author is a pecu- liarly articulate person, able to analyze and explain with great skill the various "drives" which warred within her and to make it understandable just why she finally chose to use all her force in the creation of a vast garden in which things are permitted to grow under the circumstances in which they grow best. In not many autobiographies is the author more precisely aware of her place in the scheme of things, her capacities and limiations. Women seem to have a talent for self- revelation and Mrs. Symington has cultivated her large share of that talent to make a book which has something in common with the great self-portraits of the past. BIOLOGICAL STAINS: A Handbook on the Nature and Uses of the Dyes Employed in the Biological Laboratory. Fourth Edition Revised. By H. J. Conn. With the collaboration of J. A. Ambler, R. W. French, W. C. Holmes, et al. Revised with the assistance of J. T. Scanlan, Anis P. Brad- shaw, and Mary A. Darrow. Biotech Publications, Geneva, N. Y. $3.40. 8 x 53; 308; 1940. This recognized and authoritative handbook of dyes employed in the biological laboratory has been given a very careful revision and brought completely up-to- date. New material embodied includes description of thirteen dyes not previously considered. The sub- ject covered so adequately by this book is becoming a field for more and more precise knowledge all the time and hence the urgent need for just such a volume as this. In addition to the succinct presentation of the nature and uses of the various dyes themselves, the book includes a discussion of the history and theory of staining, and the spectrophotometric analysis of dyes. The appendix contains much valuable infor- mation arranged in convenient tabular form. The volume is concluded with a complete bibliography and index. To students, technicians, and seasoned inves- tigators everywhere, this manual of stain technology- one of the few acceptable to the discriminating scientist -should prove of inestimable and increasing value, as its previous editions have done. AMEzCA'S HOUSEKEEPING BOOK. Compiled by New York Herald Tribune Home In- stitute. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. $2.00. 8i x 538; xxiv + 607; 1941. A manual for the housewife. The book has been in the making for upwards of 15 years. It developed out of numerous letters and telephone calls from house- wives for aid on household matters. Frequently, long and difficult research was necessary by the In- stitute staff to find solutions to some of these problems. The material is well organized under three headings: Home organization; Housekeeping methods; and Operation and maintenance of the home. The index, which covers 28 closely printed pages, gives some indi- cation of the number of subjects covered. We men- tion only a few of these: electric shock, medicines, removing stains, heating systems, household pests, electrical repairs, paints and stains, repairing furniture, doors, etc., treatment of walls, and soaps. Many illustrations are included. DIRECTORY OF MICROFILM SOURCES including Photo- stat Service. Compiled by Rose C. Cibella. Special Libraries Asso- ciation, New York. 75 cents. 10 x 7; vii + 56; 1941 (paper). A directory for librarians, research workers, and in- dustrialists. It has been issued to make available the data now in hand, but a revised edition is contemplated which will furnish a much more complete s6t of records. There are listed 202 universities and libraries which now provide microfilm or photostatic service, also a number of commercial firms. A group of sample order forms in use by various institutions, a geographical index of microfilm sources and an index to equipment help to make this directory extremely useful to those wishing to avail themselves of the fine opportunity offered by libraries in the United States, Canada, and England.</page></plain_text>
