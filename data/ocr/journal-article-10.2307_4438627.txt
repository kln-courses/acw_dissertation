<plain_text><page sequence="1">Original Science Fiction Useful in Teaching the Geologic Time Table JEAN E. COOPER Senior High School Biology Instructor Cheyenne, Wyoming A great many of my biology students are avid readers of science fiction. I made a modified use of this interest in presenting the different periods of the geologic tinib table in beginning biology classes. I have never felt that my students obtained an ade- quate idea of the types of living things found during the various geologic periods from class discussion alone. In order to overcome this lack, to some extent, and also to add some spice to the biology classes, I assigned the writing of fiction stories about specific prehistoric animals. The students were to obtain information on plant types, climate, and habits of the assigned animal and other animals found during the period in which the main animal character lived. This factual information was to be incorporated into the story. The fictional report permitted a cer- tain amount of anthropomorphism, but mnan was not to enter the picture except as an observer unless he actually lived during the assigned period. Background material, includ- ing pictures of the organisms, was made available in the laboratory. Of course, as is always true, many of the students did not follow instructions and many did not not obtain or effectively use the nec- essary background material. However, I feel that the majority did learn something of the geologic periods and the different types of plants and animals living during the periods. The better stories were made available for all the students to read. In addition to learn- ing some facts, some of the students also found that writing in biology can be fun. They were supposed to follow standard composition form. However, some wished to write poems instead of compositions and this was acceptable. Some added cartoons and other illustrations. In addition to finding many of the stories amusing, I found that some of them pre- sented rather good character studies of the authors. The character studies were entirely unintentional and in some cases rather start- ling. Following are two of the stories which were written in this project. These were chosen for inclusion here because they repre- sent two different approaches to the problem. Adventures in the Jurassic Period ROBERT JODER, Junior Senior High School Cheyenne, Wyoming Considering the facts as they now stand in this day and age it is utterly impossible and illogical to transport one's self back through time to any desired age. However, if the time called for such an act I might bring myself to do it. Supposing it were possible to go backward in time to any age, there would probably be several different methods, such as a time capsule or time ma- chine. I prefer the easier and less expensive way of putting one foot in front of the other in a series of motions. At any rate, I arrived at my destination, the Jurassic Period. It was a strange place indeed. The vegetation was quite unlike any- thing you would be likely to run into in the 20th century. The majority of the land was swampy, with cattail-like plants projecting from the shallower parts. The land was clut- tered with thick vegetation consisting of fern trees and moss. The thing that struck me as strange was the complete absence of grass. My next step was to cross the swamp in a northeasterly direction. This posed a diffi- cult problem. How was I going to cross that formidable swamp? After a little pondering, 17</page><page sequence="2">18 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER October 1954 I decided that if I could stretch my imagina- tion so much as to think that I was in the age of reptiles, I could stretch it a little more and say that there was a foot bridge put there for my convenience. I intend to use this means of getting over obstacles in order to further my travels. During my jaunt across the swamp, I came upon an animal that scientists of the 20th century flatter with the name Brontosaurus. It was a very convincing animal, referring of course, to its size, and could be compared to some humans existing in the 20th century. However, his impressiveness ended with his size. He had very little in the way of per- sonality. He couldn't possibly be handsome, except maybe to another Brontosaurus. His only virtue seemed to be his ability to eat (he ate by drinking water containing water plants). He seemed to be utterly brainless because he had only one pound of brain to all thirty-five tons of flesh and bone. Every once in a while this monstrosity would lift his head and gaze around as if he were expecting the untimely arrival of some enemy. This was a possibility considered by all inhabitants of the period because it meant survival or death. As I continued my journey, I came upon many scenes and heard many sounds. I saw a huge animal that walked on his hind legs, ripping the last pieces of flesh from the bones of some hapless creature that was now un- recognizable. The sounds of animals came to me as they led their daily lives in the deep depths of jungle. The scream of some animal came crawling and slithering through the air as it drew its last breath of life. Fly- ing reptiles filled the air in their search for food. I came upon many graveyards where bones were bleached white in the sun show- ing the end of the trail followed eventually by the rest. The steaming humidity of the air, combined with what I saw, made my flesh crawl and my backbone quiver. Finally, as the sun made its descent in the west, a change came over the land. As the sun cast its last golden rays across the swamp and trees, a silence and tranquility came to cover the horror of the day. It was almost as if love and peace had invaded the jungle and made it a living paradise. This could not last. This was but an intermission between acts or a prelude to a seemingly unreal drama. When the sun lifted its head above the moun- tains in the east and again put its golden rays upon the land, all the horror of the preceding day would again be relived and reinacted with the result being, as before, death. My Daily Assignment KATHRYN FOWLER, Junior Senior High School Cheyenne, Wyoming I'm a newspaper reporter for the Daily Icicle. The other day my newspaper assign- ment was to interview the president of our fair and very cold land. He is Mr. Syntheto- ceras, the first three-horned mammal ever to be president. He thought I was a bit odd, I know, but it was my daily assignment. I want to relate some of the unusual answers I re- ceived from our president as I asked him the odd questions. May I add that I am a very good and close friend of the president? Here are a few of the many questions and answers I received: 1. "What is your name?" "Synthetoceras." 2. "What is your address?" "President's Mansion on Icecube Street with a vol- cano on each side. The volcanoes erupt only once a week but I don't get in the way." 3. "What is your phone number?" "Well, we just had a new phone put in-let's see was it Pliocene 9-5463 or Miocene 9-5463? Oh, I think it was Pliocene 9-5463." 4. "When is your birthday?" "Oh, my goodness, my mother never told me that. It was quite a while ago because I'm get- ting old and I have only about one mil- lion years to live." 5. "Where were you born?" "I was born right here in the City Icepital." 6. "What are some of your plans for the future? " "One plan is to try to figure out some way to help our friend Plio- hippus (the horse) to grow three horns, big horns like mine, so he can learn to fight his own battles in Congress instead of running away." 7. "What do you do in your spare time?" "Well, most of my spare time is spent</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 16, No. 6 SECONDARY ROOT DEMONSTRATION 19 in w,raxing and shining my three horns. They are my pride and joy as you know and I don't want them dull. I also like to play marbles with Amphicyon (the dog)." 8. "What is the present outlook for the world of the future? " "That is a very hard question to answer because so many strange things have been happening late- ly. The weather is extremely cold and some of our friends are leaving the country, and some just up and disappear like the American Rhinoceros. The small animals of our kingdom have no protec- tion except their speed. Most of our friends have grown to enormous sizes and many have sprouted horns for pro- tection. The buffalo-deer cow has done such a thing. But the American Rhino- ceros is still the only one with a horn on it nose. The grass is getting shorter for vegetarians and the herbage is get- ting heavier. The members of the cat family are now meat eaters. The near- elephants have become real elephants and mastodons with great tusks. An ice- age is coming and I think it will be within the next ten million years." These were a few answers I received from our great President Synthetoceras.</page></plain_text>
