Contributions from professional and amateur scholars are welcome. These are reviewed by academic readers before being accepted for publication. The Editor will be happy to discuss their projected contributions with contributors in advance. Address all correspondence to The Editor, Journal of the Polynesian Society, Linguistics, University of Waikato, Private Bag, Hamilton, New Zealand (E-mail RAYHARLOW@WAIKATO.AC.NZ). Manuscripts should be typed on A4 or similar paper, on one side of the paper and with all material double-spaced. Submit the original plus a photocopy but keep a further copy to guard against loss. Manuscripts will not be returned to authors unless requested. Simple references to literature should be placed in the text giving only the surname of the author, the date of publication and the page number, e.g., (Best 1924:184). Footnotes should be kept to a minimum, and they should be numbered consecu tively throughout the text and typed not at the foot of each sheet but listed together on a separate sheet at the end of the text. On a further sheet should be given a complete bibliography of all works cited arranged in alphabetical and calendrical order, as in the following examples: Best, Elsdon, 1924. The Maori, Vol.1. Wellington: Polynesian Society. Firth, Raymond, 1936. We the Tikopia. London: George Allen and Unwin. - 1954. Anuta and Tikopia. Journal of the Polynesian Society, 63:87-131. If two or more works by the same author published in the same year are cited, they should be distinguished in both footnotes and bibliography by small letters immediately following the date of publication. Maps and line illustrations must be drawn in black ink on heavy white paper. In maps, lettering of a professional standard is required. Photographs submitted for publication should be of high quality, printed on single-weight glossy paper. Manuscripts, photographs, drawings and maps which do not meet the Journal's technical requirements will be returned to authors and will not be considered for publication until they are brought into conformity with the instructions set out above. Authors of articles normally receive 20 free offprints. Additional offprints will be supplied for cost of printing if ordered before date of publication. The views expressed by contributors are their own. In publishing them, neither the Editor nor the Society necessarily endorses them.</page></plain_text>
