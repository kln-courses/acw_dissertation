<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religious Studies from Cambridge Reported Miracles A Critique of Hume J. Houston Hume argued that no reasonable person should believe the report of miracles as exceptions to nature's usual course. Houston argues that miracle stories may contribute toward the reasonableness of belief in God, and, appropriately attested, may be accepted by believers in God. To bol- ster his case he examines historically and intellectually significant writings about the miraculous. 41549-7 Hardback $59.95 St. Paul's Theology of Proclamation 1 Corinthians 1-4 and Greco-Roman Rhetoric Duane Litfin How did the apostle Paul operate as a preacher, and why did he operate in the way that he did?

THE SOCIAL ECOLOGY OF RELIGION VERNON REYNOLDS, Oxford University, and RALPH TANNER, University of London No society exists in which religion does not play a significant part in the ordinary lives of people. Yet the functions of the world's diverse religions for ordinary human beings, and the impact of adherence to them on their survival, have never been fully described and analyzed. In this book the authors undertake to show how religions in all parts of the world meet the needs of ordinary people and frequently have important consequences for individual reproduction and survival. With scientific data and examples, Reynolds and Tanner show that religions have down-to- earth functions in the management of the main events of the human life cycle-birth, marriage, death, and the events in between. Surveying the beliefs of religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shinto and others, and how they concern themselves with major issues such as abortion, sex in and outside of marriage, divorce, and sickness, the authors demon- strate a strong correlation between environ- mental factors and religious ideas which either favor or disfavor reproductive success.
