<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CRISIS IN MANAGERIAL ROLES IN ITALY Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA) The dilemma of the Italian manager seems to stem more from social change and from new behavioral expectations aris- ing therefrom than from a conflict between roles. The roles the manager must perform within the firm, as technical expert and as executive - and in society as the firmfs representative and as citizen - are not necessarily in conflict, nor do they give rise to incompatible expectations. Indeed, em- ployees of the firm and members of society in general today regard the manager in much the same way and have similar This article is a translation, authorized by author and pub- lisher, of an abridged version of F. Derossi (1974) fTLa crisi del ruolo direttivo, " Studi Organizzativi, VI (2). It is based on a study conducted in 1971-1972 by the Centro di Ricerche In- dustriali e Sociali (CRIS), with financial support from the Ford Foundation. The study involved interviews with 663 Italian managers (for details, see F. Derossi [ 1974 ] "A Profile of Italian Managers in Large Firms/1 International Studies of Management &amp; Organization, IV [ 1-2], 138-202). The "man- agers" in this study operate at levels below the top one (whether owners or appointed chief executives). The translation is by Rosie Morse, of the University of Penn- sylvania. Dr. Derossi, formerly co-director of CRIS, is now a manage- ment consultant on social problems in the United States. 64</page><page sequence="2">Managerial Roles in Italy 65 expectations of his role. This indicates that the role of the manager now requires types of behavior previously ignored or barely sensed by managers but not in conflict with each other. Nor can it be said that there is a profound conflict between the expectations of others (employees and society) and the man- ager's perception of his role. When the firm is faced with external problems - that is, when the relationship between the firm and the environment becomes tense - it is the manager himself who becomes aware of the inadequacy of the traditional definition of his role; and this awareness leads to a readiness on his part to accept extensions and modifications of his role. The current crisis facing the manager seems related, on the one hand, to the pressures for change by diverse social "ac- tors," including the manager himself, and, on the other hand, to the difficulty faced by the manager in attempting to translate into behavior the new perception of his role. The more complex this new role, the more serious is the manager's lack of prep- aration to perform it and the inadequacy of the help provided by the organization. It is our hypothesis that up until now, most Italian managers have not participated in the decision- making process (an observation our research substantiates) and that they have been held responsible for the solution of problems of only a technical nature. Above all, the manager is an imple- mentor of decisions others have made without consulting him. Thus, he is expected to concentrate only on the performance of functions internal to the company; and he cannot involve him- self, as a representative of the firm, with problems of a politi- cal and social nature. In summary, our hypothesis, supported by numerous findings of our research, is that the traditional managerial role is in a state of crisis and that the manager is conscious of it, that he experiences an internal conflict because of inability to develop a new model of his role and to modify his behavior accordingly. This is the result of the pressures brought to bear by numerous and diverse factors - some of which are internal to the orga- nization, whereas others are related to the social and political</page><page sequence="3">66 Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA) environment in which the firm operates. Factors Influencing the Change in Managerial Roles We are dealing with a process that involves a number of pro- tagonists (role-senders*) who, in varying ways, influence the transformation of managerial roles. One of the protagonists is the manager himself: his higher level of education, the de- velopment of a professional identity, and a concomitant growth in motivation all lead him to aspire to greater organizational responsibility and therefore to power. In fact, this may be seen as a logical development rather than a drastic transformation; moreover, this is not necessarily in conflict with the expecta- tion of the second f 'protagonist ": corporate leadership, which is beginning to delegate greater responsibility because it is faced with increasing administrative complexities. With the increasing delegation of responsibility, the leader- ship makes greater demands on the manager: it requires of him increasingly specific competence, flexibility, and reliability. These pressures force the manager to update his expertise and increase his efforts even as he becomes burdened with new du- ties. This is a challenge that places him under constant "stress," both physical and mental, which, however, he is ready to accept, because of the positive gains to be derived therefrom. The two principal sources of change in the managerial role come from the technical and from the social environment of the firm. They have produced a transformation in both the techni- cal-administrative and the sociopolitical aspects (initially em- bryonic, or even nonexistent) of the manager's role. Changes in Technical- Administrative Function During recent years, changes in Italian industry have been *In sociological terms, a "role- sender" is understood to mean a person whose expectations with respect to the behavior of another person help to define the latterTs role. - Ed.</page><page sequence="4">Managerial Roles in Italy 67 extremely rapid and intense. When asked to describe substan- tial changes that have occurred in their firm (1), only 35 man- agers of 633 (6 percent) were unable to give examples. The table below synthesizes the types of change under four headings: Changes internal to the organization Percent Technological: new methods of production 16 Financial: capital expansion, change in stock ownership, mergers, new investments 25 Market: expansion or reduction of the market, new products, competition 26 Human: new man at the corporate-leadership level, new union and personnel policies 33 100 (n = 543 Italian managers) This summary does not reveal the multiplicity and complex- ity of these changes since the respondents often describe two or more changes that have occurred simultaneously or are in- terrelated in some ways. Even if it is true that each change can be associated with the activity of a specific department of the organization (techno- logical innovations influence production; market problems in- fluence sales; etc.), it is nevertheless quite likely that each change also affects the entire organization. For instance, the introduction of a new product generally involves technological changes, new investment, and changes in work habits; thus, it affects more than one of the firm's activities. In reality we are dealing with changes in the firmTs long- term policies that may have relatively permanent effects on the firm's internal structure. They are real rTturning points" in the life of the firm. These transformations amount to substantial interrelated modifications in the administrative patterns and structure of the firm:</page><page sequence="5">68 Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA) Types of transformation Percent No change 6 Change in: Administration - one department 23 Administration - the entire firm 24 Organizational structure 10 Organizational structure and administration of individual departments 14 Organizational structure and administration of the entire firm 23 100 (n=633) Although it is probable that changes in management style, because of the necessary adaptation to new technologies and the ever- changing problems facing the firm, are not an uncommon experience for the managers, nonetheless, changes in organiza- tional structure are relatively new. Moreover, a structural change is almost always accompanied by a change in adminis- trative patterns. This is due, in part, to an increase in the size of the firm, in technological complexity, and in the size of the market, which is translated into greater articulation and sub- division of functions. "New" departments, such as marketing, and new services, such as data processing, have come into ex- istence. Other departments, which earlier were in an embry- onic stage, have evolved and become more important. This is the case of the research and development department in high- technology industries, and of the planning department in all firms. In addition, the relative importance of certain organizational functions has changed, and hence there has been a change in the importance of the departments involved. Particularly in firms that, because of the nature of their products, are market ori- ented, sales have superseded production as the leading depart- ment. In general - because of the increasing importance of forecasting, corporate planning, new product planning, and their</page><page sequence="6">Managerial Roles in Italy 69 financial implications - small service units have acquired a determining influence on the traditional services represented by production and sales. The organizational structure has become - even though this may not be made explicit in the organizational charts - a mixed structure (staff and line). In some firms divisional structures have evolved; this implies greater decision- making autonomy at the division level. (2) Thus, a process of decentralization and delegation, in addition to the development of interdepart- mental links, has become necessary. This has facilitated the development of multiple internal roles; in particular, as deci- sion making has become broader in scope, both the leader role and peer roles have gained importance. Functional links first maintained on an individual, voluntary, and, above all, informal basis have become institutionalized through the practice of in- terdepartmental and group meetings composed of people of dif- fering hierarchical levels and functions. A considerable num- ber of managers, in response to changes involving the entire organization, have experimented with redefining their own roles: Transformation of the manager's role Percent No change 26 Recently transferred to present position 10 Position formerly nonexistent, but created recently (independently of organizational changes) 1 Recently created position in response to organizational changes 15 Position has been modified because of internal dynamics 4 Position has been modified in response to organizational changes 44 100 (n=660) Discussion of problems produced by change is plentiful in</page><page sequence="7">70 Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA) the sociological literature. Resistance to change is an expected phenomenon, and studies have been conducted to find ways to overcome it. Every change in responsibility should be preceded by timely information and, if possible, by consultation with the parties involved. It is in this situation that a conflict can de- velop between the new demands of the role- sender - the orga- nizational leadership - and the manager's image of his role that he has developed through repetition of behavioral patterns that are psychologically difficult to abandon. Since the change is not the result of a spontaneous choice, but is imposed on the manager by people in positions of greater power, stress situa- tions and conflicts with the people forcing the changes are likely to develop. (3 ) The change in the technical-administrative role has most certainly entailed difficulty and conflicts. This change, how- ever, has occurred in the context of a dynamic, basically favor- able situation - that is, while the firm was growing. Thus, the firm offered its members greater power gratification. The im- portance of individual managers was increased, and more rapid career advancement became possible. The series of technical-administrative changes was the re- sult of a logic of rationalization that could be easily accepted. The survival and development of the firm necessitated these changes. Groups of old managers, torn between their emotional identification with the firm and their desire to retain former work habits, ended up by giving in, but remained ambivalent. New, young, managerial recruits, more open to innovation, or at least less bound by age-old work habits, were given respon- sible positions thanks to the changes that were taking place. The latter often owed their promotion to new policies; hence it was easy for them to be the instruments of change. Readiness to accept further changes in technical- administra- tive role is therefore present. The positive reinforcement of rewards linked to role modification has enabled managers to overcome the difficulties involved in learning new managerial styles and has paved the way for the acceptance of future changes.</page><page sequence="8">Managerial Roles in Italy 71 Changes in Social Function Significant pressures originate from subordinates and from the external environment. These pressures have developed simultaneously with a breakdown in the autonomy of the firm's internal system. Labor disputes in the fall of 1968 and ensuing periods are the clearest manifestations of this breakdown. To this must be added the slow but negative influence of the grow- ing intervention of the government in the economy and in the management of the largest firms, of social distrust of the in- dustrial system considered as the source of the problems in the community - overcrowding because of labor immigration, urban decay, pollution - and the resulting rejection of indus- trial values in favor of "quality of life." Production efficiency and economic progress take second place to noneconomic values in such a context. Although these values are still vague in the collective conscience, the community has begun to insist that the firm begin to act with social responsibility. The manager, as representative of the firm and as one who benefits most from it through financial compensation and through the wielding of power, is today invested with new responsibil- ities. Employees constitute the channels by which pressures are brought to bear on the firm from the social environment. These are people who used to be passive subjects in the organizational structure, amorphous material on which technical-administra- tive roles were shaped. The Crisis of Authority From the point of view of the relationship with his subordi- nates, the manager can be considered the administrator of the firm's system of rewards and punishment. This function is invested with tremendous power. The ability tó control or in- fluence hiring, compensation, job assignments, salary in- creases, careers, and even the dismissal of subordinates gives the manager a very strong conditioning influence over his sub-</page><page sequence="9">72 Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA) ordinates. The existence of the modern personnel office, rather than limit this power, has standardized the procedures by which it is exercised. The intervention of a supreme centralized authority can have little effect in limiting managerial authority in this field. The fact that the power is vicarious, acquired by delegation, and that the supreme authority resides at higher levels does not limit its exercise. It is, in fact, the immediate superior who knows his subordinates best and who can best judge their pro- ductivity. It would also appear to be fair that the manager, who operates indirectly through his subordinates and is responsible for his department, should have the right to select the employ- ees, to allocate their responsibilities, and to dismiss, if need be, the unproductive elements. Until the 1968 labor conflicts, this type of power internal to the organization and focused on people was one managers enjoyed with the utmost latitude. Their authority was derived in large measure from the consid- erable margin of discretion they exercised in determining the professional career, the compensation, and the job security of their subordinates. This occurred in a market characterized by an over supply of labor. The exercise of authority over people offers considerable satisfaction, which is primordial, immediate, and visible. In a vertical and rigidly stratified society such as exists in Italy, a power role within the organization corresponds to privileged positions in the external society. The individual is conditioned by his experience to view all social roles as principally verti- cal, that is, involving subordination or authority. The young person is usually in a subordinate position within the family structure, in the schools, in the military service, and during the initial periods of his career; but in some cases the role is reversed, a mature person living lower in the particular hier- archy. After long years of apprenticeship within the firm in subor- dinate positions, the manager finally achieves a privileged status vis-à-vis other individuals, and from this he derives a large part of the satisfaction he gains from his work. This</page><page sequence="10">Managerial Roles in Italy 73 power, inasmuch as it is instrumental to the pursuit of produc- tive goals, is amply legitimized by the organization. Undisputed on the inside, it has been contested externally: the EmployeesT Bill of Rights (4), labor contracts specifying qualifications and salary increases, the practical impossibility of firing employ- ees, the diminished docility of subordinates, quick reactions from unions and their interference in decisions that were ear- lier managements prerogative - all have eroded the power over subordinates on which so many managers based their supe- riority and prestige. Not without cause, some executives complain of the loss of the supporting managerial "instruments": ". . . managers lack the means to get the work done; for instance, they no longer have the power to reward or punish." "The executive no longer has control; he does not re- ward, he does not punish." "The manager does not have any more authority over disciplinary matters." tTIn managing personnel, the pressure instruments are lacking." "Before, in our organizations, managers could offer merit rewards, raises; now this is no longer true; they can only suggest promotions. Job classifications are no longer in our power, they are defined in accord with the unions. There has been an almost complete loss of au- thority." ". . .if the option to punish is removed, authority is lost, and there is no longer among the employees that submission that stems from fear of losing the job." (5) As a result, the executive has had to reexamine and modify, even drastically, his concept of authority. The majority is aware that authority has been challenged: only 10 percent think that there has been no change, and 19 percent believe that it affects only some groups - older colleagues or those in direct con-</page><page sequence="11">74 Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA) tact with the workers. The rest have experienced it personally: the difference lies in their methods of adaptation and in their perception of the causes. A small group, still suffering the shock of the change, is unable to define it and considers it an individual problem (9 percent). A larger group has attempted to interpret it by raising their perception of the crisis from the individual level to a larger sphere. For them it has been a cri- sis in values related to the organization and to society as a whole: Percentage of Managers Transformations in the holding the concept of authority particular view No transformation 10 Partial transformation (in the case of old managers or those in contact with the workers) 19 Transformation occurred at the individual level 9 Transformation for all managers caused by: 1. The reaction of subordinates and union pressure 15 2. A crisis in traditional organiza- tion values; the concept of manage- ment has changed and authoritar- ianism is finished 29 3 . A crisis of society as a whole that involves the firm 18 100 (n=655) The challenge to traditional authority has not been limited to a particular group of managers. It could be hypothesized that the managers most exposed were (1) those whose function placed them in direct contact with the workers, that is, produc- tion managers; (2) those in line rather than in staff positions</page><page sequence="12">Managerial Roles in Italy 75 (the latter usually have a smaller number of subordinates); and (3) those at low management levels. It could be further hypothesized that the crisis is related to industry size and lo- cation, that is, predominantly to the North of Italy, which is traditionally more unionized. Nevertheless, none of these variables considered in our re- search seems to have influenced the perception of the crisis in authority. The crisis has involved all of industry, throughout the country; and it appears to have affected the great majority of managers. Some differences are related to age, since older managers, accustomed to a work situation in which con- flict has for many years been limited or circumvented, are the ones who acknowledge a greater awareness of the crisis: Age group, Percentage of managers who years see a crisis of authority 35-40 65 41-50 71 Above 50 78 In any case, the percentages are high in all categories. External Sources of Conflict Most of the studies on role conflict have examined situations internal to the organization; often they have been limited to the study of a few people who are in personal contact with one an- other within the work environment. What distinguishes our analysis is the hypothesis that the sources of the crisis in man- agerial roles - rather than stemming from internal tensions peculiar to the work environment and being of limited scope - are exogenous to the organization. (6) Specifically, the conflict appears to have been introduced by union action. It is of inter- est to note that in firms in which conflicts with the unions (mea- sured in terms of the ratio between numbers of strike days that occurred in the year in which the interviews were conducted</page><page sequence="13">76 Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA) and the previous year) are on the decline, the percentage of managers who think they have suffered a drastic reduction in authority is lower as well (the figures are, however, generally high even in this case) : Labor Percentage of managers who disputes see a crisis of authority Decreasing 62 Stationary 69 Increasing 80 It is true that the firmTs authority has been challenged by some members of the firm who have brought the challenge in from the outside. Very often, however, and quite rightly, the manager has regarded the workers' pressures as a manifesta- tion of a more extensive phenomenon of an exogenous nature. The active participation in the strikes of groups not belonging to the organization (students and workers from other firms have joined the picket lines) has led to the belief that the con- flict had external roots - in a movement diffused in society, which manifested itself also in other forms, such as the con- flict between generations and the university studentsf protests. The hostility of public opinion, the lack of police protection dur- ing the strikes, and the apathy of the government have contri- buted to defining the external environment as antagonistic. There are firms that, at least in the opinion of the union members interviewed, have consistently refused to have a dialogue with union spokesmen, although there are others that, since the autumn of 1968, have modified their policies and demonstrated greater willingness to discuss issues with the unions. (7) In the latter, the change in the relationship with subordinates has been sudden and drastic, and the repercus- sions have been felt in the personal relationships between a manager and his immediate subordinate. This is the situation of most of the managers who claim to have suffered a psy- chological trauma and who consider the traditional organi-</page><page sequence="14">Managerial Roles in Italy 77 zational values to be in a state of crisis: Managers' FirmTs attitude toward unions, percent reaction to crisis Partly Open be- Open in authority Closed closed fore 1969 since 1969 Shock at the personal level, insecurity 8 8 5 12 Crisis of organiza- tional values 27 27 30 41 The exogenous nature of the conflict is confirmed by com- ments of those interviewed: "The epicenter of the phenomenon is outside the firm"; "The situation is the same on the inside and the outside the firm: it is a general crisis of authority"; "There is no organization in the world that has not suffered a strong shock." Even the sources of labor conflicts and their solutions have often been seen as originating outside the orga- nization: Percentage of Managers Sources of the causes and of holding the solutions of labor conflicts particular view The firm 15 Employees and the unions 12 The firm and the unions 32 Lack of effective government action 22 The firm and the government 5 The unions and the government 6 The firm, the unions, and the government 8 100 (n= 595) (8) Until 1969 industry had enjoyed a preeminent position vis-à- vis the external environment, which it influenced more than it was influenced by it (the firm behaved as a typical center of political power). Today, the social elements conditioning the firm are stronger and more aware of their power.</page><page sequence="15">78 Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA) Obstacles to Learning a Social Role Negative Sanctions The interaction of the manager, as representative of the orga- nization, with the unions and with the rest of the firm's envi- ronment has been taking place in a context of severe social con- flict. The negative sanctions in the environment have made it difficult to learn a new social role. While status rewards and the requirements of rationality have rendered changes in the technical-administrative role accept- able, the same cannot be said with regard to the social role. On the contrary, the manager's prestige and authority have been attacked and even brutally wounded. The rejection by the em- ployees of the industrial system seemed to threaten the very existence of the organization, with which the manager was emo- tionally identified and with which, in any case, he was identified by his opponents. (9) The cognitive and effective reaction of the manager to the modification of his role initially could not be other than the neg- ative. Reactions to Role Modification Reaction Role modification Affective Cognitive + + gratification manifest Technical-administrative (promotions, rationality increased (survival and status) development of the firm) frustration apparent irra- Social (decreased tionality (threat status) to the survival of the firm)</page><page sequence="16">Managerial Roles in Italy 79 Consequently, the process of learning a new social role is much more complex than that of learning a new technical-ad- ministrative role, since both the individual and the organization resist external pressures (sociopolitical rather than technical) for change. Moreover, modification in this aspect of the role, as will be seen later, can place a manager in opposition to the organization, since he may be tempted to compensate for his loss of authority over employees by appropriating some power from the top of the hierarchy. Absence of a New Behavioral Model In contrast to the case of the technical-administrative role - which could be patterned after a more advanced model, as log- ical extension of the already existing role - the social role, necessary to establish a relationship with the external system, had never previously been adequately developed. To confront the new situation a technical- rational approach was inadequate, and a manipulative approach was counterpro- ductive. The change in the form of the relationship with em- ployees and the development of contacts with external institu- tions require both a review and a broadening of the managerial role. To obtain this it is necessary for the manager to develop or have a model to conform to, that is, a coherent set of behav- ior patterns to imitate. This example has not been provided to him by either his previous theoretical education (school has not even prepared him for leadership) or his practical experi- ence, whether at work or in social life. Moreover, the manager has not been trained to carry out multiple functions simulta- neously, and even less to face eventual social conflicts; thus, he has not been able to develop the necessary approach and flexi- bility. So far as revision of the concept of authority is concerned, behavioral models offered by Italian institutions - the family, the school, the army, or the work organization - are all of an authoritarian nature, in which hierarchical power prevails over participation. Today most managers are aware that these mod-</page><page sequence="17">80 Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA ) els, across all social institutions, are in a state of crisis, and consequently are not valid and cannot be used successfully. The new roles, which ought to translate the social responsibilities of the organization into action, have not been defined. The firm itself has been unable to develop a new vision of these roles in anything but words, giving them only an abstract expression that inhibits translation into behavior. What is worse, often the organization has denied by its actions all pre- tense to democracy and openness. For the manager, the situation appears to present problems, but not solutions. The emotional shock, the flight from respon- sibility, and the inability to adopt new behavior patterns effec- tively are therefore understandable. At best the manager may be willing to abdicate his authority, while proving unable to establish a new, effective method of dealing with his subordi- nates. He may be aware that his function today, as the person responsible for the organization of work, is not limited to spe- cialized activities, but includes interaction with the social and political environment; yet he may lack the tools and the policy directives necessary to translate this new concept of interre- lationships into action. In this delicate process the interven- tion of the organization itself is required to institute new poli- cies and practices. The Effects of External Pressures The fact that the pressures for a modification in behavior came from the outside means that the individual faces forces beyond his control, and what is more, often unforeseeable. Moreover, the likelihood of solving the conflict on an individual basis appears impossible, inasmuch as the pressures exercised on the manager are not brought about by any peculiarity of his behavior, but are of a more complex and broader origin. Thus, he can easily develop a feeling of impotence, because of his lack of control over the elements that cause the pressures and his inability to cope with them. The impossibility of avoiding the conflict underscores the frustration. To reduce the ten-</page><page sequence="18">Managerial Roles in Italy 81 sions, he should narrow his sphere of contact, limiting himself to the performance of purely technical functions, filtering or refusing communication. But this strategy of "isolation" be- comes impossible in a situation characterized by a high degree of functional interdependence between the individual and the role- senders. In fact, interdependence calls for continuous coordination, which is not possible without constant interaction. Limiting communication undermines productivity. By iso- lating himself from his subordinates, the manager places him- self in the position of not being able to perform his function. Without workers, who represent the link with the external en- vironment, managers would not have been exposed to labor and social conflicts. They would have been protected, in the first case, by the top echelons of the organization, where responsi- bility is concentrated, and in the second case, by the physical separation of the firm from the environment. For the first time in the history of union conflicts, the man- ager has found himself directly involved in these conflicts. (10) The participation of the employees in the strikes engulfed even those managers who until then had remained "out of the skir- mish." Even more frustrating, in many instances, was the be- havior of the organizational leadership, which many considered ineffective. Moreover, others thought that the social unrest of the autumn of 1968 was the result of years of bad relations with the unions, which the firm had not cared to improve or had pur- posely exacerbated. For the most part, the leadership was unprepared to face union pressures: it gave no clear directives to its managers and left them in an ambiguous situation. The managers found themselves in the midst of the conflict without support, as if caught between two fires. In some instances they were in- structed to avoid open conflicts, even at the risk of losing au- thority. The manager was thus forced to witness impotently the attack on his personal prestige. In other cases managers were given orders to maintain discipline and a "hard line" at all cost, with the result that when the firm retreated to a less drastic position, the managers felt betrayed.</page><page sequence="19">82 Flavia Derossi (Italy- USA ) In any event, the substantive victory of the unions left all managers with the feeling that they had lost authority and status in front of their subordinates. Through the exposure to the changed attitudes of subordinates, labor and social conflict has become for many a direct and burning experience. Two years after the autumn of 1968, the majority of managers had had an opportunity to think over the experience and develop adaptive reactions. In contrast, a minority (9 percent) appeared not to have recovered from the initial shock, and were unable to eval- uate the situation and develop new behavioral patterns. A measure of the uncertainty in which the manager finds him- self is indicated by the limited social prestige he attributes to his own activity and, even more dramatically, by the discrep- ancy between the prestige he attributes to himself and the pres- tige in which he believes public opinion holds him. Presented with a list of six occupations offering similar economic remu- neration, only 15 percent of those interviewed ranked the in- dustrial managerial profession in first place. Much more val- ued in their opinion were such professions as law, medicine, and teaching at the university level: Percentage of managers according this profession Profession first place University professor 37 Professional 30 High civil- service official 8 Congressman 8 Bank manager 2 Industrial manager 15 100 (n=627) Given that each person interviewed was allowed three choices, in decreasing order, it is of interest to verify whether management appears as a second or third choice.</page><page sequence="20">Managerial Roles in Italy 83 Position of the manager Percentage of managers on the scale of prestige holding particular view Manager in first place 15 Manager in second place 27 Manager in third place 31 Manager not mentioned 27 100 (n= 642) But the interesting point, which reveals disequilibrium, emerges from the comparison between the self-ascribed pres- tige and the prestige in which the manager believes public opinion holds him. We are dealing with perception, not with reality (since we have no data for the Italian population as a whole). It is exactly this subjective evaluation that allows us to infer the ambiguity of the role and the painful uncertainty of the manager concerning his own position, inasmuch as the importance that the manager attributes to his profession has validity only within his professional group, but is not seen as shared by society. The difference in the percentages is very indicative. Seventy- eight percent of managers feel that public opinion does not include them among the professionals of im- portance: Position of the manager Managers' opinion, percent on the prestige scale Personal Public Manager in first place 15 3 Manager in second place 27 6 Manager in third place 31 13 Manager not mentioned _27 _78 100 100 (n= 642) (n= 636)</page><page sequence="21">84 Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA ) Role Modification Development of the Managerial Class and of a Separate Group Identity Frustration or role modification as a reaction to social and labor conflicts is merely an individual response. If the crisis of authority is part of a broader crisis - as many think - then these solutions are limited; and the problem should be approached through a restructuring of the manager f s role in its entirety. Even if the method of interacting with subordinates is changed, the problem of dealing with the rest of the organization and, more importantly, with the external world remains unresolved. But a reformulation of the role cannot be undertaken by each manager individually, because the problem is of concern to managers as a professional group and therefore requires a collective approach. For a long time, the manager has identi- fied himself with the organization. This identification, however, presupposes a vision of the firm as a monolithic entity (quasi-anthropomorphic), or at least as a harmonious organism composed of integrated parts, when in reality the conflict has revealed a split within the firm. The managerial group has been isolated from the leadership, some- times put in conflict with it (as discussed earlier, many man- agers consider the organizational leadership responsible for their frustration, if not for the general situation); and the dis- tance between the managers and the workers has increased to the point of seeming an unbreachable chasm. The awareness of being in the middle has caused many to question their professional identify for the first time. This new awareness has often been accompanied by a feeling of un- certainty, particularly in the case of middle managers, who are in an intermediate position between the workers and the leader- ship. A number of statements attest to this: rTThere is a managerial crisis, which I feel very strongly. Once the manager was very close to the own-</page><page sequence="22">Managerial Roles in Italy 85 ership and, in fact, was their representative. Today, he is becoming a bridge, the buffer between capital and labor. However, he has not yet developed a precise func- tion: he has not determined whether to be a mediator, or whether to take sides with labor, or whether he is closer to the ownership, whose problems he knows very well .... The manager is at the center of the contro- versy between capital and labor: in considering the two sides, he still does not know which one to choose. " (11) "The manager is neither fish nor fowl. In the past he has tried to be represented by the unions, but they threw him out. He has tried to identify himself with the interest of the owners (that is, to be on the other side of the trenches), but he was not wanted." "He does not have the strength of the group behind him; he is alone. Because he is alone, he is discussed by everyone. Some managers are close to the ownership, while others are close to labor." Today the problem of professional identity is recognized by most managers, though with considerable confusion: in prac- tice all foreseeable developments presuppose the formation of a managerial class and a collective definition of the function and the characteristics of its members. The comments of the managers interviewed have allowed us to define a range of pos- sible role choices, however embryonic and vague, that the man- agers seem to prefer. The comments we shall use to support our argument are, for the most part, derived from a question on the usefulness of union representation of managers within the firm - this provision being included for the first time in the National La- bor Contract signed by CIDA and Confindustria in 1970. (12) The answers dealt with the more general problem of the use- fulness of and the roles to be played by a management union, which many interviewees so far have supported only super- ficially:</page><page sequence="23">86 Flavia Derossi (Italy- USA) Opinions on management union Percentage of managers representation in the firm holding particular view No opinion 11 Opposed Because the relationship with the firm is of a fiduciary nature on an individual basis 18 I Because of identification with the firm | or with the ownership 8 Ás a general orientation 8 Favorable Only for large firms 9 1 Because of group solidarity 21 f 55 As a general orientation 25 J 100 (n= 655) The Manager as a Professional Several factors have made managers aware that they con- stitute a distinct professional group: 1. The number of industrial managers has grown consider- ably, from 6,000 in 1938 to more than 50,000 today. 2. The age at the time of promotion to the managerial level has been lowered, 36 being the average age. 3. Young managers appear to be better prepared (81 percent have college degrees); consequently, they identify more easily with their profession than with the firms that employ them. This greater technical and cultural preparation has resulted not only in professional awareness but also in greater self- assurance in dealing with both employers and workers. Many of the managers interviewed voiced a sense of technical and moral superiority; this perception represents the natural evo- lution of the traditional definition of the technical role of the manager following recognition of the importance of administra- tive and leadership abilities.</page><page sequence="24">Managerial Roles in Italy 87 These specialized skills justify the self- definition of the man- ager as "a professional man," "the economic collaborator of the owner," and "an expert consultant of the firm." Such skills help to distinguish the manager from the firm's owner, to whom he sells a service, and from the other subordinates, who have much lower qualifications. Professional skills grant the man- ager bargaining power. As the services he offers the firm are valuable and indispensable, in them lies his true protection; and, therefore, "union representation is useless and has no meaning." This awareness of his own professional ability can cause the manager to refuse a group identification. The group that manifests professional identification is quite large: 118 strong, 18 percent of those interviewed. One is surprised to learn that they belong to all age groups, that they are of varying educational levels and at various hierarchical levels, and that they work in different- size firms. These dif- ferences might reasonably be expected to influence the re- sponses concerning unionization, yet no statistically significant differences have been found in terms of these variables. In- stead there is a positive correlation between rejection of union representation and a wide breadth of experience (13) combined with a high technological level of the firm to which the manager belongs: Percent of managers who refuse unionization, by industrial sector Advanced Traditional Intermediate (electronics, (textile, (machinery, aeronautics, Breadth of food, paper, steel, oil, some experience publishing) rubber) chemicals) Difference Low 40 46 28 +12 Average 28 41 66 -38 High 36 50 48 -12 Difference +4 -4 -20 -24</page><page sequence="25">88 Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA) When combined, two indicators of a high level of profession- alization - the variety of managerial experience and the high technological level of the firm - reinforce the negative attitude toward union representation. Hence, the characteristics of the firm explain the orientation toward unionization better than do the personal characteristics of the individual. For instance, where labor disputes are on the rise, the number of managers who hold a professional and fiduciary orientation toward the work relationship decreases: Percentage of managers Level of labor who see relationship with disputes firm as fiduciary Decreasing 27 Stationary 27 Increasing 15 Similarly, the percentage decreases in firms that in the autumn of 1968 were forced into a drastic revision of their pol- icies toward the unions, that is, in firms that "opened" them- selves to dialogue only after 1968. (As previously discussed, this sudden development put the traditional relationship between subordinates and managers in a state of crisis and diminished the latter Ts authority.) Percentage of managers Attitude of firm who see work relationship toward unions as fiduciary No change Closed 27 Open before 1968 21 Partial change Partially open 30 Drastic change Open after 1968 16 However, the very growth of the firm renders the role of the</page><page sequence="26">Managerial Roles in Italy 89 'Independent professional" or of "the consultant" precarious and impractical. Since he is deeply involved in the organiza- tion, the manager cannot remain out "of the action" for long. To conceive of oneTs own role as a specialized task is equiva- lent to taking refuge in an ivory tower, from which one must continually come down because of the necessity of frequent in- teraction with other members of the organization. Whereas the contact of the consultant with his client can take the form of written reports, the contact of managers with other members of the firm takes place verbally, daily and without mediators. In contrast to outside consultants, the manager, in addition to making proposals for new decisions, is the one whose responsi- bility it is to translate decisions into actions by making use of the assets and the personnel of the firm. The consultant is judged on the validity of his suggestions; the manager, on the practical results - productivity, cost- cutting, etc. - that he must achieve. He is also prevented from behaving like a consultant by his superiors; moreover, in his coordinating and supervisory role he is exposed to pressures from the lower ranks of the organi- zation. The "professional" ideal is, in summary, albeit in a more complex form, a return to the ideal of the "pure techni- cian," which, however, is denied by the daily reality of an orga- nization. The Manager as "Entrepreneur" and as Technocrat The search for an identity may lead the manager to look at the upper echelons of the hierarchy, thus identifying with the owner himself. This attitude does not constitute a general identification with the organization, insofar as he is considering only one element, the top. Some go beyond aspiring to become part of the power group; they believe that they can deprive it of authority and take its place. Hence, many comments in jus- tification of the refusal to unionize are based on these two in- terpretations of the role:</page><page sequence="27">90 Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA ) Identification with the entrepreneur: "A manager above a certain level must consider him- self as an employer rather than as an employee. " "At work I behave in the same way as the owner. Unionization would mean to make labor demands on my- self." "I can't conceive of a union for managers any more than I could conceive of a union for heads of government." Replacement of the owner: "The union is not necessary because today the man- agers are part of the firm - there is no more owner." "The managers cannot and must not form a union. They are the firm. It did not make sense even when there was an owner. The stockholders do not make themselves heard; the firm is in the hands of the technocrats." "The owner as a person is destined to disappear little by little. The Agnelli and the Pirelli are the last instan- ces in an irreversible process. Consequently, the man- ager will increasingly identify himself with the firm in which he works. In part, he has already assumed some entrepreneurial functions, and the subordinates consider him responsible for the general running of the organiza- tion. ..." From these comments it is clear that the identification with the firm held by many interviewees does not focus on the entire organizational body, but only on the head, the center of power. Identification with the ownership or with the leadership is facilitated by the social class of origin of the majority of man- agers (40 percent are upper class; 47 percent, middle class; but only 13 percent originate from the working class) and by their elitist attitude. (14 ) The aspiration to go so far as even to replace the owner and the entrepreneur in the control of the firm is supported by the evidence - confirmed by many - of</page><page sequence="28">Managerial Roles in Italy 91 the split between ownership and control and by the purported end of the Schumpeterian-type owner and of the family firm. All these phenomena should make the managers the real leaders of the firm. It is probable that the crisis of authority involving subordi- nates has also modified the relationship with the top of the hier- archy or, at the very least, expectations regarding it. Until the fall of 1968 there was an equilibrium of pressures: the manager received orders from the top and, in turn, passed them down - reformulated and specified - to the lower ranks of the hier- archy. Thus, he was conditioned by the top; but, in turn, he was able to condition those below him. His reward consisted in part in the exercise of power. The sphere of authority, which is now restricted, may once more be enlarged by the annexation of new managerial prerog- atives, chipped away from higher managerial levels. The psy- chological satisfaction derived from the exercise of authority can be effectively replaced by the granting of a greater voice in the affairs of the organization, broadening of de cisión- making responsibility, and allowing participation in long-range plan- ning. Is this perspective realistic ? Are we truly facing a pro- cess of delegation that affects all managerial levels ? The de- centralization of responsibility represents one of the structural and administrative transformations mentioned by the managers. This is claimed quite frequently, in 30 percent of the cases; only 5 percent saw a centralization of power. In the course of our research we have tried to measure em- pirically the latitude of the decision- making authority of the managers. This has been accomplished by asking the inter- viewees to describe the most important decisions taken in the last few years and classifying them according to whether they were innovative or risky, or whether they were decisions made to implement policies handed down from the top of the organi- zation. Most managers were unable to cite other than routine decisions:</page><page sequence="29">92 Flavia Derossi (Italy- USA) Percentage of managers Latitude of decision- in the making authority particular situation Makes routine decisions (related to policy implementation) 62 Allowed innovation in own department 28 Allowed innovation also involving other departments or the entire organization 10 100 (n= 653) The scope of decision- making power is clearly restricted at levels below middle management. Below this level, only 29 percent of the managers are able to describe innovative deci- sions they have been able to make. Consequently, the process of delegation is reduced along the hierarchical scale. It is worth underscoring, however, that even if we concentrate on the upper levels, the percentage of decision makers is less than 50 percent: Hierarchical Percentage of level decision makers Higher (just below chief executive) 43 Middle 41 Lower 29 If we then consider the participation in the planning of long- range organizational policies, the percentages become notably lower. Only a small minority of managers claims to have been consulted or even to have participated - either as expert or only as witness - when an important decision was made:</page><page sequence="30">Managerial Roles in Italy 93 Participation in Percent of long-range planning managers No consultation 52 Consultation only at implementation time 11 Preparation of data and reports leading to the decision 22 Participation in the formulation of the decisions 15 100 (n=618) The highest level of participation is concentrated at the level immediately below the top [ here referred to as "higher"] : Percentage of managers Hierarchical who have participated level in policy making Higher 33 Middle 11 Lower 6 In spite of the fact that there is a delegation process, new and risky decisions and the definition of company policies remain concentrated in the hands of a small group, so that the majority of managers is excluded from the effective exercise of power. The image of the manager as leader of the organization there- fore appears, at least for the moment, unrealistic. The Manager as "Proletarian Worker" Recognition of their own marginality with respect to the cen- ter of power engenders in some middle- and lower-level man- agers identification with the bottom of the organization: "We have more or less the same problems as the blue- collar and low-level white-collar workers." (15) Identification with the organizational leadership is illusory:</page><page sequence="31">94 Fla via Derossi (Italy- USA ) "The manager is isolated; he is not aware that his role is that of a worker, of a subordinate. He still thinks he is a decision maker. tT "The idea that a manager is also a decision maker is no longer valid: he is a paid employee with more respon- sibilities. ..." We are in a subordinate position; we do not shape or- ganizational policies." For some, this identification with the worker is a consequence of the leadership's attitudes: "The firm treats us like illegiti- mate children. We are not given due recognition." For others, it is the result of the confrontation with labor: "The manager has lost his status: he is no more or less than an employee." For many this has been recognition of an already existing situation. Together with the loss of authority, union gains have reduced the distance between the two categories (managers and employees); and the delegation of authority from the leadership is slow and insufficient to remedy a situation that changes with such rapidity and is beyond return. These comments might reveal a new conception of organiza- tional relations: a tendency toward the leveling of qualifications decreases the once extremely vertical structure of the organi- zation and its rigid stratification. Emphasis is on functions rather than on hierarchical levels. Consequently, all work groups should unite and present a common front. Especially in large firms, in which relationships on an individual level are difficult, union representation of managers is more easily envisaged as a means of communication between the workers, of all levels, and the owners. Acceptance of unionization results from the managers1 sep- aration from the ownership (or from the leadership) and from their awareness of belonging to a professional group - one of many in the firm, albeit one with special qualifications that performs a specific function. TTIn the future, workers at all levels will have to be</page><page sequence="32">Managerial Roles in Italy 95 represented by unions in their dealings with firms. Tt "Until yesterday, by tradition, the manager identified with the firm. Now he is no longer disposed to do so. He wants to feel his own strength, because he considers himself a worker like all the others." The Manager's Identity Crisis Identification with the leadership or with the lower levels of the organization might lead to a split within the managerial class - between the managers in high levels, who belong to the leadership ranks and are more likely to enjoy a certain amount of power, and the middle- and low-level managers, who have no decision- making power. This implies, in addition, an inability to perceive themselves as a group with distinct characteristics and functions and to have a clear understanding of their rela- tionship to the rest of the organization. The identification of thç managers with the leadership or with the workers, more than a conscious choice, is often a negative outcome: it is the result of their desire to distinguish themselves from both of the two more clearly delineated groups. Identification with the workers often follows the bitter realization of rejection by the leadership (which has excluded them from power), whereas identification with the leadership appears motivated by resent- ment of the workers1 attitude toward them. In both instances it is a case of reaction rather than genuine affinity. In reality, the managers have difficulty in identifying with each other: every hierarchical level conceives of itself as different; every individual takes refuge in his distinct uniqueness, extolling his particular characteristics at the expense of similarities to others. Actually, managers communicate very little with each other, except for work reasons; and even then their communication is restricted to a limited set of subjects. Each shuts himself within his sphere of competence as in a small fiefdom. In the- ory the only channel of communication is through their national association, of which, however, not all are members. More-</page><page sequence="33">96 Flavia Derossi (Italy- USA) over, their participation is passive, and the attitude of the mem- bers toward the association is one of mistrust. Whereas the other employees can choose from a series of intermediate as- sociations, the first being within their own organization, which links them to the national union, this situation is lacking in the case of the managerial group. (JL6) The result is a lack of class spirit even in the corporate sense (with all of its negative con- notations). Their "professionalism," which could constitute a strong common ground, is accompanied by an exaggerated in- dividualism, which prevents the development of a group identity and, consequently, of any collective action. At the meeting called by the CIDA in November 1973, several role choices were proposed, which can be summarized as fol- lows: (1) the manager as ordinary subordinate; (2) the manager as an alter ego of the decision maker; and (3) the manager as professional, innovator, and leader. It has been remarked that this last role (the only one that considers the managers1 cate- gory as having an autonomous and distinct function that enables them to assume the role of mediators in the conflict between capital and labor) presupposes that the managers, as a group, have developed their own system of values. But whereas the working class is considered "as embodying the values of prog- ress, of freedom . . . ," the managerial class "does not con- sciously propound any original or autonomous values." The managers have not been able to develop a group ideology even under the stimulus - which, after the initial shock, could have been invigorating - of the social and labor unrest of au- tumn 1968. Their "culture" is limited to the expression of a system of values of their social class - a class of which they are members partly because of their social origins and partly because of their economic standing. It is an urban culture of the middle to upper- middle classes, but not specific to their profession. Consequently, the development of a managerial "culture" cannot take place while the horizon of the manager is limited to the organization because it presupposes openness to the problems of the society with which the firm constantly interacts.</page><page sequence="34">Managerial Roles in Italy 97 This close interrelationship indicates that the social envi- ronment is integrally related to the administrative function. Therefore, a solution to the crisis in the managerial role does not appear possible without a revision of the function that the manager ought to perform with respect to society as a whole. Notes 1) The managers were asked the following question: "Have there been important changes in your firm in the last few years? If yes, of what type?" 2 ) A third type of organization, in which a product structure and a functional structure overlap (with the introduction of pro- gram managers), of which many instances are found in the United States, was, at least at the time of this study, still rela- tively new in Italy. 3) See especially R. Kahn et al. (1964) Organizational Stress. New York: Wiley. 4) A law issued in 1971, a direct consequence of the "Hot Autumn" of 1968. 5 ) It may be of interest to observe that these comments are made by relatively older executives, in their fifties. 6) Robert A. Nisbet writes that changes that occur "inside" a social system are merely accidental or minor adaptations. The system tends to perpetuate itself. Any important change in a social system originates outside it. See R. A. Nisbet (1969) Social Change and History. New York: Oxford University Press. P. 280. 7) During the study, we have asked union members of differ- ent political leanings to evaluate the attitude toward the unions held by each of the 50 firms in the sample. Four distinct cate- gories have emerged: (1) firms that have always been "closed" to dialogue; (2) firms that have a long tradition of readiness for dialogue; (3) firms that are partially "open"; (4) firms that have "opened up" only since 1968, following the strikes of the "Hot Autumn." From the point of view of the manager and of his relationship with his subordinates, the major change has occurred in this last category, since, from a situation of rejec-</page><page sequence="35">98 Flavia Derossi (Italy- USA) tions of the unions and of dialogue with subordinates, the firm has shifted to new types of relationships, that is, it has modified its policies toward the unions. This sudden "opening" has often involved a diminution, equally sudden, in the existing discretion- ary powers of the managers over the workers. 8) Forty- six did not answer. To these must be added 11 interviewees who feel that their firm has not been exposed to labor conflicts. 9 ) It is possible that the strong identification of the mana- gers with the firm - owing in part to the fact that almost half of them (47 percent) have always been with one firm, and in part to the lack of awareness that they form a distinct profes- sional group - has involved them to an even greater degree in the crisis of the organization, at the very time when industry survival has been jeopardized by attack from the unions and its func- tion has been questioned by society. 10) One must go back to the first years after the war in order to find similar situations. It should be remembered that the average age of those interviewed being 45, the majority did not directly experience that period. 11) These and the following comments are taken from the interviews. 12 ) The CIDA is the association representing managers in Italy, and Confindustria is the Italian Association of Industrial- ists. The system of management representation within the firm (RSA = company union representation) mirrors the ex- isting system introduced for the other employees after the "Hot Autumn." 13) The breadth-of- experience index has simultaneously taken into account several factors - e.g., level of education, knowl- edge of foreign languages, travel abroad for study or work pur- poses - allowing the greatest number of points to those who had a college degree, spoke English, and had lived abroad for an extended period of time. 14) See F.
