<plain_text><page sequence="1">OBSCENITY, CENSORSHIP, AND JUVENILE DELINQUENCY* BERNARD GREEN** THERE is widespread belief that a causal relationship exists between an allegedly increased dissemination of obscene material' and the increase of juvenile delinquency rates.2 It is the purpose of this paper to examine the evidence for this belief with a view to deciding whether present methods of controlling the content of communication are justified or adequate. We are concerned with the effects of the mass media--newspapers, magazines, books (hard cover, paper-bound, and comic), radio, television, and motion pictures--on juvenile conduct. To facilitate discussion, the material that follows has been organized under several headings. The first, "Some Facts and Definitions," includes a description of the organization and pervasive- ness of the mass media, and definitions of obscenity and juvenile delin- quency. The next section, "The Effects of Pornography," reviews, first, scientific studies and the opinions of experts about the effect of pornography and mass communications on delinquency, and, secondly, as illustrative of the complexity of the causal problem, the single offence of homosexuality. The third section, "The Control of Obscenity," describes and evaluates present methods of restricting' the flow of obscenity in the community. The final section summarizes the material that has been presented and suggests improvements that can be made at the present time. I. SOME FACTS AND DEFINITIONS In this paper we distinguish between public and private mass media of communication. Our purpose in classifying the media will become apparent in the discussion of the control of obscenity.5 For present purposes a public *This article is based upon a paper prepared for Professor Glueck's seminar in Juvenile Delinquency at the Harvard Law School. Although the material discussed herein is primarily American, the writer hopes that it will nevertheless be relevant for Canadian readers: if there is a causal relationship between exposure to obscenity and juvenile delinquency in the United States, it is likely, that such a relationship also exists in Canada. The examination of American legal and extra-legal control of obscenity should prove interesting because it is only a matter of time before Canada has an adequate Bill of Rights. **Faculty of Law, University of Toronto. 1See interview with Postmaster General Summerfield reported in the New York Times, April 24, 1959, p. 12, col. 1.

Thus, as an example, we are not concerned with erotic paintings. 4We cannot hope to prevent the flow completely-an impossibility. 5See p. 252 infra. 229 Vol. XIV, No. 2, 1962</page><page sequence="2">230 THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL mass media can be regarded as one that informs the consumer of its owner- ship or control: thus radio and television stations broadcast their call letters; books that move in commercial trade include the name of the publisher; on the other hand, publishers of hard-core pornography6 do not typically publicize their names on the wares they distribute. For the moment, we restrict our attention to the public mass media of communication. That the mass media pervade the United States is self- evident. Nevertheless the statistics are impressive. Officials of a leading American network could report in 1957 that over 40 million families had television sets, and that each family spent over five hours a day with its set on.7 According to one recent estimate, 300 million copies of paperback books were sold in 1959, "accounting for close to one half of all books sold and nearly one-fifth the industry's total dollar income. ..."8' We will examine each of the mass media in the order in which a child is first likely to be exposed to it. Most children begin viewing television in early childhood, a fact which has increased fears of its effects. For the pre-school child, television in modern America now fulfils the function that the grandparent is said to have performed in a less hectic age-that of an amusing babysitter. Children on the average watch television for two or three hours a day.9 Many view even the late evening programmes. Neilsen ratings show that of an audience of 100 at 10 P.M., eight are teen-agers and six are children; as late as 11:30 P.M. five teen-agers and three children are still in the audience.'0 The other media pale in significance when compared to television. Radio as a source of entertainment has been largely supplanted by the newer medium; it is in places where television cannot reach that radio listening is wide- spread. Only comic books" begin to compete with television for the child's interest. One research team found that 83 per cent of the children in their sample under 11 years of age, and 50 per cent of those between 11 and 17 years, read more than two comics a week.12 At about six years of age the child begins to attend the motion picture theatre. In the beginning he usually goes to the movies once a week, normally on a Saturday afternoon. Attendance increases to some extent as the child grows up-the 18-20-year-old male living in a large city is the most frequent movie-goer.'a The average newspaper or illustrated magazine can be read by the child of eleven. At that age, if he is interested in books, he will begin 6See E. and P.

But he is unlikely to buy books until he is a few years older. The extent to which juveniles are exposed to the mass media is only relevant for present purposes to the degree that the media contain obscene matter. Although numerous studies of the content of the mass media have been made, none are very helpful. One of the most thorough-Himmelweit's work on television4--merely discloses that children in their early teens view programmes that discuss adult problems and contain excessive violence. No mention is made of obscene material. As a result of the recent "clean-up" by the comic book industry, the criticisms of Wertham,"5 which were based upon the sexual sadistic content of some comic books, are now less relevant. The major complaints have centred on motion pictures-including the manner in which they are advertised-magazines, and paper-bound books. By the time a juvenile is 10 years old (and goes to the movies with friends) he can, subject to legal restrictions in some jurisdictions,'6 view the same material as an adult movie-goer. There is no doubt that juveniles are exposed to pictures that are designed to stimulate sexual desire. Similarly, men's magazines-Playboy is a leading example-which are now under attack, contain material intended to stimulate desire. Some paper-bound books have also been written for that purpose. And there are certain world- famous tabloids that appeal to the prurient interest of the reader. But we do not know how many juveniles read or see this type of material. Nor do we know how much of it is consumed by any one juvenile. Our knowledge of the extent of juveniles' exposure to the private mass media is also fragmentary. One high government official in the United States estimates that every year a million and a half children are victimized by the pornographers,17 while another places the figure at one million.18 Estimates of the money involved are probably also based more on imagina- tion than on knowledge, and figures from $500 million'9 to $1 billion20 a year have been quoted. There are indications that the "mobsters" have entered this lucrative field, using techniques that they have developed over the years.21 In view of these statements it is interesting to note the statistics on ratio of arrests to complaints for sending pornography through the mails: in the 1958 fiscal year there were only 315 arrests as a result of 70,000 complaints.22 In any case, we do know that it is very difficult, if not impossible, for parents to control the type of material to which their children 14Note 9 supra. 15Fredric Wertham, Seduction of the Innocent (1954), p. 174. 16See p. 244 infra. 17New York Times, Sept. 19, 1959, p. 16, col. 4. 18Ibid., Aug. 29, 1959, p. 15, col. 8; see also ibid., Nov. 25, 1959, p. 26, col. 1. l9Ibid., April 24, 1959, p. 12, col. 1. 20Ibid., Oct. 11, 1959, p. 114, col. 1.

And the child who is most likely to become a delinquent, a member of a multi-problem family, is least likely to receive the guidance that parents usually give in a normal family. Numerous attempts23 have been made to define obscenity. However, these definitions were designed primarily to enable the state to distinguish between materials whose dissemination in the community at large it was proper to prevent and other materials. Unless otherwise indicated, we will adopt two alternative criteria for determining whether material is obscene for children: is the sexual content of the communication likely to stimulate the juvenile's sexual desire, or does the communicator urge the rejection of accepted standards of sexual behaviour? One reason for choosing these criteria is that young boys can be aroused sexually by non-sexual stimuli.24 It would be impossible if not ridiculous to include these stimuli within the term obscene for purposes of censorship. Our classification obviously excludes much that is customarily characterized as obscene. Material that arouses disgust rarely provokes the kind of action that causes the disgust. Thus, persons who excrete on the streets are taken in hand by the state. But surely the state does not intervene because society thinks that the defendant's conduct will stimulate others to duplicate it. The other major term to be defined at this time is "juvenile delinquency." In keeping with the general statutory trend in the United States we use the term to refer to anti-social conduct of persons under 17 years of age. Although juvenile delinquency covers such seemingly minor peccadilloes as violating municipal ordinances we limit it to serious conduct that would rank at least as a misdemeanor under state law. II. THE EFFECTS OF OBSCENITY At the outset, it should be noted that no scientific study of the effects of obscenity upon delinquency has ever been published.25 For this reason we 23For the views of anthropologists see: La Barre, "Obscenity: An Anthropological Appraisal" (1955), 20 Law and Contemporary Problems 533, 543; cf. Honigmann, "A Cultural Theory of Obscenity" (1944), 5 Journal of Criminal Psychopathology 715; Margaret Mead, "Sex and Censorship in Contemporary Society," New World Writing (3rd Mentor Selection), pp. 18-19. For a psychiatric view see Abse, "Psychodynamic Aspects of the Problem of Definition of Obscenity" (1955), 20 Law and Contemporary Problems 572, 580. In his essay, "Obscenity as an Esthetic Category" (1955), 20 Law and Contemporary Problems 544, Kaplan, a philosopher, has made a brilliant attempt to distinguish the four varieties of obscenity; see at pp. 554, 555, 557. For the definition of an ecclesiastic see Burke, What is the Index? (1952), p. 37. Two psychologists, E. and P. Kronhausen, have outlined some indicia for distinguishing between the pornographic (which the state is entitled to prevent and to punish) and the erotically realistic which is valuable to society: Pornography and the Law (1959), pp. 178, 195, 203-5, 207, 211, 217, 219, 222-7, 232, 243. Hard-core pornographic materials are described by William Lockhart and Robert McClure, "Censorship of Obscenity: The Developing Constitutional Standards" (1960), 45 Minnesota Law Review 5, 60, n. 337; 61, n. 340. 24Kronhausen, Pornography and the Law, p. 277. Some children are sexually aroused by the National Anthem. 25Cf. Kronhausen, Pornography and the Law, p. 284.</page><page sequence="5">OBSCENITY, CENSORSHIP, AND JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 233 will examine the literature on the effects of mass communication upon delinquency, and then consider sexual crimes of the kind that presumably would be committed by a consumer of obscene matter. Perhaps the most famous-or notorious-study of the effects of the mass media of communication upon delinquency is that of Herbert Blumer and Philip Hauser, Movies, Delinquency and Crime.26 These authors concluded that motion pictures were an important factor in the criminal careers of 10 per cent of the males and 25 per cent of the females in their sample.27 In their view, the movie provided a point of identification for the pre- delinquent. They contended that the potential delinquent was greatly influenced by the gangster heroes who lived in great wealth, and by the movie heroines who used their natural endowments to secure the material benefits of living in the twentieth century. If the findings of Blumer and Hauser are valid, we could extrapolate and say that, even though there is no direct evidence of the effects of obscenity, there are good grounds for implicating obscenity as a causal factor in delinquency. We are thus forced to examine the techniques employed by Blumer and Hauser.28 Their method-that of the questionnaire and autobiography-is subject to the criticism that it required them to rely on the insight of the subjects, surely an ultrahazardous undertaking.29 Furthermore, they did not have any control group-one of the essentials of a valid experiment. For these reasons one would have thought that their research would have been relegated to the social science wastebasket. Yet in 1954, Dr. R. H. Felix, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, writing to the Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency, cited it as a valid piece of research."3 And Hovland, one of America's foremost students of communications, lamely concludes that "the picture presented by Blumer and Hauser may be some- what exaggerated."3" There have been other, more meaningful, investigations of the relation- ship between motion picture viewing and juvenile delinquency. Cyril Burt, in 1925, found that 7 per cent of delinquent boys were avid movie-goers.32 In a later study, Healy and Bronner concluded that delinquents were more 26The study by Blumer and Hauser (1933) was one of a group sponsored by the Payne Fund. 27Ibid., p. 198. 28See Mortimer Adler's brilliant and devastating, Art and Prudence (1937), esp. pp. 260-85. 29"Many of the autobiographies were elicited by a schedule of guidance questions... to direct [the informant] to specific topics and concrete experiences: e.g. 'How important do you think the movies were in getting you into trouble?' . . . If instead of giving motion picture life histories, these investigators had been trying to study the effect of automobiles, the home, the church, the school or anything else, upon criminal careers, and had constructed similar guidance sheets . . . they would certainly have obtained the same kind of results, equally unreliable of course, as scientific data."

What they tend to prove is that the person who attends movies three or more times weekly "had a stronger urge than the non-delinquent boys for exciting outlets.""35 There has been even less valid research on the effects of comic book reading by children. Only after examining the evidence presented to the Senate subcommittee on juvenile delinquency36 would one have felt it necessary to discuss the relationship between comic books and obscenity. However, Fredric Wertham, a practising psychiatrist, formerly of Johns Hopkins University, had expressed himself forcibly on the subject before the hearings took place. On numerous occasions, and in one book,"7 he claimed that he and his co-workers had found comic book reading to be a major factor in delinquency. Professor Pittman's criticism of Wertham's findings seem well taken: He [Wertham] ignores the scientific rule for research investigations involved in the testing of one variable, comic books, on the personality of the child. If Dr. Wertham had followed the usual procedure of having experimental and control groups, one could discuss the differential effects, if any, of comic books on the emotionally maladjusted child as compared to the normal child. Since Wertham is a psychiatrist, his universe is over-represented with those who possessed behavior disorders before they became addicted to comic and horror stories.38 The views of other psychiatrists seem less dramatic. Thus Reed39 and Bender and Lourie40 adopt the position, to use the language of Reed, that "the child's own tendencies determine to a large extent its interest and self- identification."41 On this view it is the emotionally unstable child who is likely to be influenced by undesirable matter and who therefore requires protection.42 No studies have been published on the effect of television on juvenile delinquency. However, our discussion is facilitated by the recent work of 33William Healy and Augusta Bronner, New Light on Delinquency (1936), p. 72. 34S. and E.

They concluded (p. 220) that "we feel that our evidence is sufficient to warrant ... research, not merely into whether these programs do harm-this, we think, has been sufficiently explored...."" Such a bold conclusion does not seem warranted by their research or the research of others. But since their book has had an impact in the United States44 we are compelled to examine it. We will first set out some of its conclusions, and then analyse the authors' evidence and methods of obtaining that evidence. In our survey we found no more aggressive maladjusted or delinquent behavior among viewers than among controls.... Even in extreme cases, the influence of television is small. The child's emo- tional make-up and the total of his environmental influence determines his behavior. Our findings... suggest, then, that these programs do not initiate aggressive, maladjusted, or delinquent behavior, but may aid in its expression. They may not affect a stable child, but they may evoke a response in the 5 to 10 per cent of all children who are disturbed or at least emotionally labile.45 ... We find.., .evidence that... [crime programs] may retard children's awareness of the serious consequences of violence in real life and may teach a greater acceptance of aggression as the normal, manly solution of conflict.46 It is possible from these findings to extrapolate to the likely effect of crime and detective programs on children. The attitude to violence and the various other values which they contain.., .are conveyed repeatedly and in dramatic form.... there is therefore no reason to suppose that these programs will not have their cumulative influence especially on those concerned with their own feelings of aggression and hostility.47 Compared with the Blumer and Hauser study, the research methods of Himmelweit show a definite improvement. The workers used a control group and avoided some of the most serious pitfalls of the Blumer study, such as the use of leading (guidance) questions. But their methods remain inadequate. What is crucial is the effect of television on the child's person- ality. To ascertain this the investigators relied on personality inventories answered by the child, and assessments of the child by his teachers. If the researchers recognize, as they do, that the personality inventories have not been validated,48 how can they use them as tests to determine the effects of an unknown factor, television? They attempted to test the validity of the childrens' answers to the questionnaire. The test-the insertion of a fake item-indicated that an average of 8 per cent of the answers to factual 43(Italics added.) Some psychiatrists have testified that television is highly crimino- genic for emotionally disturbed children. See evidence of Dr. Ralph S. Banay, Hearings of the Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. (1955), p. 83. This is merely the expression of opinion, however expert. See the discussion of Wertham's work, p. 234 supra. 44See M.

Ibid., at p. 416.</page><page sequence="8">236 THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL questions were invalid. We have, therefore, good reasons to ignore differences of this magnitude or less. And in the important matters reported in some of the tables in Appendix I there is hardly any difference at all between the control groups and the viewers." Perhaps one of the most important criti- cisms that can be made of this recent example of research by social psycho- logists is that it does not present any evidence to support the finding "that these programs... may evoke a response in... children who are disturbed.""' Furthermore, either the language used by the authors is designedly murky or the "experts" in communication-the social psycholo- gists-lack the ability to communicate in an intelligible manner. What do they mean by "evoke a response"? Is a grunt a response? Is a murder a response? What do the authors mean by "may"? Does "may" indicate probability or possibility? The views of Himmelweit have a lessened relevance for our purpose for reasons which are evident in her discussion of the effects of television on children's ideas about marriage: "Television appears to have only a neg- ligible effect here-for two reasons: first, children get their views about family life chiefly from the home: secondly, television by stating two con- flicting views, may well destroy the potential impact of its plays.""' Those who are concerned about pornography52 have expressed a fear that a child's exposure to it will affect his sexual behaviour and, more particularly, lead to sex crimes and juvenile delinquency.53 If Himmelweit's explanation of the minor effect of television on children's attitude to marriage is correct, is it not likely, for the same reasons, that whatever obscenity appears on the television screen also has a minor effect on children's attitude to sex? It may be helpful to digress for a moment to consider some of the studies on the effectiveness of communications in changing attitude and behaviour. Although these studies at first appear remote from our centre of interest, we believe they shed light on certain aspects of our problems. Only in a totally controlled environment is the effectiveness of communication at its maxi- mum. In our time, the concentration camp and the prisoners-of-war indoctrination camp are the most perfect examples of a totally controlled environment. Studies have been published on the effectiveness of these camps in changing political ideas."5 In one sense, these concentration camp 49Ibid., e.g., Table 69, p. 501. 5Olbid., at p. 215. 51Ibid., at p. 248. 52By "pornography" we refer to that type of material which would be clearly obscene by present judicial standards.

But in another sense they are excellent: despite the claim that the mass media present a uniform set of values (values which the critic finds distasteful) or that pornographic material is flooding the households of the nation, we still do not have the situation that obtained in Dachau or in the indoctrination camps operated by the Chinese during the Korean War. Even in the totally controlled environment of these camps, prisoners did not change their political ideas.55 That strong needs are not immediately affected by the mass media of communication was interestingly shown by the study of Lashly and Watson"5 on the effect of a film which dramatized the consequences of venereal diseases and of continence. Although the viewers reported a temporary increase in fear of venereal diseases, there was no decrease in exposure to these diseases.57 We now turn from an examination of research to consider expert opinion. D. H. Lawrence claimed that pornography is "an invaluable stimulant to the vice of masturbation."58 Two psychologists, on the basis of self-examina- tion, have stated what everyone knows: pornography, and even obscenity, stimulates the viewer erotically.59 But what is the effect of being stimulated erotically? In responding to this question these experts have been cautious,60 and quite properly so. Such usual and becoming caution was not shown, however, by two expert witnesses before a Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency. Dr. George W. Henry and Dr. Benjamin Karpman both claimed that consumption of pornographic material (they were discus- sing hard-core pornography, such as photographs of flagellation scenes, vivid descriptions of various perversions, etc.)-could lead to sexual aber- rations and juvenile delinquency."' Dr. Henry agreed with the suggestion put to him that many senseless teen-age killings are the direct result of some sort of erotic stimuli. His theory is that the teen-ager who engages in a senseless killing is an insecure person. And much of the teen-ager's insecurity is a result of his poor adjustment as a male. To bolster his ego the teen-ager has to do something bold to give him the feeling that he is a man.62 One reads and rereads the testimony. Yet the difficulty remains: what is the relationship between the erotic stimuli and the teen-ager's insecurity resulting from his poor adjustment as a male? Dr. Benjamin Karpman's 55See Schein's article, note 54 supra. 56This study is discussed in Hovland, note 31 supra, p. 1066. 57TSee also the amusing study reported in Kendall and Wolfe, "The Analysis of Deviant Cases in Communications Research," in Lazarsfeld and Stanton, Communications Research (1948-9), p. 161. 58Pornography and Obscenity (1930), p. 41. 59Kronhausen, Pornography and the Law, p. 261. 6OIbid. 61Their evidence is summarized in Interim Report pursuant to S.

One aspect of Karpman's theory is unique, and the gist of it needs to be set out verbatim. In response to a question on whether the reading of pornographic literature might increase the tendency of the young reader to become a juvenile delinquent, Karpman answered in part as follows: Tension is tension. When [we] take a young boy who is reaching adolescence, and he is hungry for information on sex, but for some reason or other doesn't get it at home because the mother and father are too tired to talk to them [sic] about four-letter words and other nasty things. Where is the boy going to find it? He can't find it at home. He doesn't always find it at school. .... He looks for it in the gutter and there he comes across pornographic material... and that draws him into all sorts of gang life, which later discharges itself as juvenile delinquency.6" Perhaps his theory explains the lower delinquency rates in the Scandi- navian countries as compared to those in the United States. Or does it? If Karpman is right our delinquency rate should be much higher than it is now. How many children receive adequate sex information from home or school? How many adolescents satisfactorily resolve the conflicts associated with sexual desire before they marry? There have been no scientific studies designed to test the Karpman and Henry theories. It is worthy of comment that in his The Sexual Offender and His Offenses64 Karpman does not indicate that exposure to pornographic material has any significance in the etiology of sex offences.65 An examination of one sexual offence, homosexuality,66 illustrates the complex nature of the causal problem. We know that homosexuality is not unique to our society. Ford and Beach67 report that in 49 of the 76 primitive societies studied, homosexuality was considered normal. Even in relation to our own culture, which considers homosexuality an abomination, Kinsey could make the claim (which even if imprecise is still astounding) that nearly 4 per cent of adult white males are exclusively homosexual, that over one-third of the males interviewed had some adult homosexual experience leading to orgasm, and that 10 per cent of younger married men admitted having concurrent homosexual experience after marriage.68 Is there any connection between exposure to pornographic material and 63Interim Report, Senate Subcommittee Investigating Juvenile Delinquency, 84th Cong., 1st Sess.

The authors concluded that sex offenders exhibited (1) a reaction to Oedipal entanglements, castration fears, or fears of approaching mature females psychosexually, (2) interpersonal inhibitions of schizoid to schizophrenic proportions, (3) weak ego strength and lack of adequate control of impulses, and (4) concrete orientation and minimal capacity for sublimation. 66We chose homosexuality for several reasons. No other sexual deviation has been explored as intensively; this deviation is fairly common. See A.

A scientific answer would require duplicating Kinsey's studies in a country similar to the United States, where prior examination had shown differences in the extent of the dissemi- nation of pornographic material between the two countries. Even though lacking such studies, we nevertheless have some historical evidence that there is no direct link between pornography and homosexuality. In his Studies in the Psychology of Sex, Havelock Ellis reports that the death penalty for sodomy was resurrected by the Church at the Councils of Paris (1212) and Rouen (1214) because of the prevalence of homosexuality in France."9 The dates, 1212 and 1214, are important. There was no printing at that time, and therefore no comic books, spicy newspapers or books to be distributed to a mass audience; there was no radio, no television, no motion pictures. Writers on homosexuality have emphasized their own specialty to the exclusion of others, a practice not unknown in criminology. Psychiatrists, and especially those of the psychoanalytic school, have emphasized the importance of Oedipal conflicts and castration fears.7' A geneticist, Franz Kallman, has pointed out that there are important constitutional factors at work in this as in other problems.71 But in no scholarly study that has been examined has there even been a hint that pornography or the mass media of communications was an important causal factor in the etiology of homo- sexuality. However, Wertham in a recent publication implicates the mass media, claiming that the Batman stories-a series popular with children- suggest homosexuality.72 This claim has been effectively refuted by Pittman who points out that Wertham is guilty of psychoanalytical anthropomorph- ism-"the infant or child isn't a little man with the adult's emotions, feelings and reasoning in miniature."73 Those who have claimed an important place for pornography as a causal factor in delinquency have probably been mistaken. Experts even have con- flicting views on the possible harm done to juvenile victims of adult sex offenders. Landis74 concluded that very few juvenile victims acquired per- manently wrong attitudes from the experience. On the other hand, Ralph Rabinovitch has said: "Early genital experience with adults... is one of the commonest findings in the histories we have studied of children present- ing acting-out sexual delinquency. In those cases we can recognize a com- pulsive need to reexperience gratification at a genital level .... One isolated experience, it would seem, does not tend to establish ...[this] need.'"75 If a single physical experience has little impact, we may safely assume that only 69Studies in the Psychology of Sex (3rd ed.), II, p. 45. 70For a scholarly exposition of the psychonalytic view see Otto Fenichel, The Psycho- analytic Theory of Neurosis (1945), p. 230. 71"Comparative Twin Studies on the Genetic Aspects of Male Homosexuality" (1952), 115 Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease 283. 72Seduction of the Innocent, p. 189. 73Note 38 supra, p. 240. 74"Experiences of 500 Children with Adult Sexual Deviation" (1956), 30 Psychiatric Quarterly Supplement 91. 75In Karpman, The Sexual Offender and His Offenses, p. 551 (italics added).</page><page sequence="12">240 THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL repeated exposure to pornographic material by emotionally disturbed chil- dren would be dangerous. In our discussion thus far we have dealt with the injurious effects of pornography: it is now necessary to inquire whether exposure to porno- graphy can have any beneficial results. Although there have been no scientific studies of the question, we do have the opinions of clinicians and writers. The Kronhausens, for example, have suggested that: ... by omitting the pleasurable and other emotional aspects of sexuality from sex education, a vacuum has been created between [what] the child has learned and what he or she experiences as the most urgent part of the sexual question: namely, what to do about the lustful emotions, which assert themselves with ever-increasing strength as the individual reaches puberty and ... maturity, and which from lack of free discussion or information give rise to deep feelings of guilt and fear. In this situation the ideal supplement to what is (usually) offered in the form of sex education would be books of erotic realism. ... These ... would connect that which the young person has learned in the way of sex anatomy and physiology with the lust mechanism and appropriate emotional states which accompany sexuality under a variety of conditions.7' Two law teachers have suggested, perhaps facetiously, that the stimulation of sexual desire may be beneficial in encouraging "a young man to marry rather than to experiment in unmarried love."77 And, we are told by a novelist, once this young man becomes a middle-aged husband, he may find pornography helpful in assisting him to perform his marital duties.78 The suggestion has been made that pornography may be useful to the disturbed person.79 One may ask why some experts think that pornographic material harms normal persons while others claim that it assists the disturbed. The reason is that the experts differ in their views about the effects of stimulation on the individual. Those who argue that pornography and obscenity are harmful think that an individual who has been stimulated must release his energy in a form that may be anti-social. Those who take the other view think that the consumer of obscene and pornographic material uses it as a catharsis, enabling him to do in fantasy what he is unable to do in real life. 76Pornography and the Law, pp. 282-3. And see the essay, "The Most Prevalent Form of Degradation in Erotic Life" in Freud, Collected Papers, trans. Joan Riviere (1st American ed., 1959), IV, p. 203, where the argument is made that one of the reasons men patronize prostitutes is the frequent separation in the male mind between lust and love. One may agree with the Kronhausens that the juvenile should be assisted in developing a wholesome attitude to sex and marriage and that erotically realistic material may be helpful in this endeavour. But one of the major problems an adolescent faces is that of controlling sexual desire. "Erotically realistic" material may only aggravate the adoles- cent's problem by stimulating his desire. See pp. 240-1 infra where we discuss the concept of catharsis. 77William Lockhart and Robert McClure, "Literature, the Law of Obscenity and the Constitution" (1954), 38 Minnesota Law Review, 295, 380.

III. THE CONTROL OF OBSCENITY AND PORNOGRAPHY The problems to be discussed here are among the most difficult in the field of social relations. If, as seems probable, obscene or even pornographic material is harmful only to the disturbed juvenile, should it be forbidden to all members of the community? If not, are there any methods whereby we can prevent pornographic and obscene material from reaching those who can be affected adversely by it? What persons or agencies should exercise power in this area? For the moment, we will assume that obscene material should not be banned from the general community. This, of course, still leaves unsolved the question of how we are to protect those who could be harmed by exposure to it. At the present time there is both private and state action in the field, a situation resulting from the complex interplay of many factors. The state can use either or both of two methods to control material that is disseminated in the community. It can provide a system of prior restraint- hereafter termed censorship-whereby all material requires approval before publication,sl or it can impose sanctions for publishing material that violates established statutory standards. The advantages of prior restraint82 are many, both to the communicator and to the state. For the communicator, the great advantage is that once the state has approved his material he will not be punished for disseminating it. The state is advantaged too because it does not have to wait until the material reaches those whom it would harm. Furthermore, a single decision, made by experts in the field, can apply throughout the jurisdiction, thus providing the benefits both of uniformity and expertise.83 Have these advantages bean realized in practice? The fair answer is no. To understand why the advantages of censorship have not been realized requires us to examine the areas where it has been applied.84 80See note 65 supra. 81In Times Film Corp. v. City of Chicago (1960), 365 U.S. 43, petition for rehearing denied, ibid., at p. 856, the Supreme Court, by a narrow majority, upheld Chicago's ordinance which required films to be submitted for approval by the municipal censorship authority prior to exhibition. Mr. Justice Clark, writing for the Court, distinguished cases of prior restraint of motion pictures and prior restraint of other forms of communi- cation: ibid at p. 49. For the reasons advanced by the Chief Justice in dissent it is submitted that the distinction is unsound: ibid. at pp. 51, 78; cf. (1961) 75 Harvard Law Review 51, 55. Despite the fears suggested by the dissenting justices it is highly unlikely that the Court would uphold prior restraint of books or newspapers. Cf. Near v. Minnesota (1931), 283 U.S. 697. 82See note 109 infra for the problems inherent in such a system. 83See p. 251 infra for our recommendation. 840ur discussion in this section owes much to the excellent and comprehensive Note, "Entertainment: Public Pressures and the Law" (1957), 71 Harvard Law Review 326; de Grazia, "Obscenity and Mail: A Study of Administrative Restraint" (1955), 20 Law and Contemporary Problems 609; Thomas Emerson, "The Doctrine of Prior Restraints" (1955), 20 Law and Contemporary Problems 648; Lockhart and McClure, note 77 supra, pp. 311-16; St. John-Stevas, Obscenity and the Law (1956), pp. 180-7; Zechariah Chafee, Free Speech in the United States (1954), pp. 529-48.</page><page sequence="14">242 THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL In the United States, the federal government exercises censorship powers through the Customs and Post Office departments.85 A few states86 censor movies, and one state87 censors literature. But most censorship, both of literature and of motion pictures, is by municipal censorship boards.88 The Customs Department seems to be the least important censor today. It may prevent importation of the books of Henry Miller, but its influence lacks the pervasiveness of the Post Office Department. Censorship by Customs can be very effective in controlling the importation of matter in large quantities: because of the great number of travelling Americans it cannot hope to cope with the literary citizen who has a taste for obscenity or pornography. Possibly because of the personality and beliefs of the present Postmaster General,89 the Post Office Department has been in the vanguard of the fight against alleged pornography. The Post Office occupies a crucial posi- tion in the control of communication. Publishers of magazines, especially those that reach small or specialized audiences and which, therefore, cannot be economically handled through newsstands, are dependent upon the mails to reach their customers. Similarly, the ubiquitous book, record, and art clubs need the mails to reach subscribers. The procedure of the Post Office in executing its censorship function has been described by one commentator as "characterized by informality."90 All mail other than first-class mail9' may be opened for inspection by any mail clerk or carrier. If the matter is pornographic it will not be accepted, or if accepted, it will not be delivered. The allegedly pornographic matter will be sent to the Solicitor's Department for review by employees of the Department and then by the Solicitor. Matter that the Solicitor decides is not pornographic is returned to the post- master for delivery; if the Solicitor concludes that the matter is pornographic the local postmaster informs the addressor of the decision. The addressor then has 15 days to show cause why this matter should be delivered.92 There are serious objections to the manner in which the Post Office exer- cises its censorship powers. It has not obeyed the law;"93 its decisions on what 85The statutory authority for Customs censorship can be found in 46 Stat. 688 (1930) as amended 19 U.S.C. s. 1305 (1952). The Post Office's authority is based upon 18 U.S.C. s. 1461 (1958), 64 Stat. 451 (1950), 39 U.S.C. s. 259a (1958). In Canada, s. 1201 of the Customs Tariff, R.S.C. 1952, c. 58, prohibits the importation into the country of any "books or representations of any kind . . . of an immoral . . . nature." 86New York is the most prominent: N.Y. Educ. Law s. 122. Nine of the ten provinces in Canada have motion picture censorship boards. See Welbourn, "Censorship and the Law in Canada" (1959), 24 Saskatchewan Bar Review 29. 87Georgia.

Perhaps the literary inclinations of Mr. Day will lead to a change in the practices of the Department. 90de Grazia, note 84 supra, p. 609. 91This is important because many magazines, etc., could not continue if they were forced to pay the rates for first-class mail. 92See the New York Times Magazine, Aug. 2, 1959, p. 1, for a more recent description of the operation of censorship by the Post Office. 93de Grazia, note 84 supra, at pp. 610-13.</page><page sequence="15">OBSCENITY, CENSORSHIP, AND JUVENILE DELINQUENCY 243 is pornographic can, in kindness, only be characterized as humorous.94 The type of material that has been branded pornographic-works by Heming- way, Salinger, Moravia, Maugham, Dumas, Voltaire, de Maupassant, Zola, Tolstoy, Freud9-raises fundamental issues about censorship and indeed any technique of control. Who should decide what is to be for- bidden? What criteria should be used in deciding? In the case of the United States Post Office Department the person who decides is, ultimately, the Postmaster General." The Postmaster General- and the present incumbent97 is no exception-is usually chosen by the President from the President's political party; his real function is to dispense party patronage. The man who is appointed to the position would seem to lack whatever expertise is required to perform the censorship function adequately.98 This is certainly unsatisfactory in view of the fact that even a competent decision-maker99 can be helped if he has usable principles, standards, or rules available. One writer who has examined the operation of censorship by the Post Office concluded that "the trouble with all these books [those that were banned] appears to be sex."100 Nowhere is the government given the power to bar material because it discusses sex. Only if it is "obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile"'0' does the govern- ment have the power to intervene. And though the courts have defined the term obscene in numerous cases, they have rarely held that it is a synonymo02 for sex. The record of state and municipal censorship agencies has not been any happier. The reasons for this are similar to those already discussed. For example, members of the Kansas state censorship board receive an annual salary of $2,100;103 members of any board find it physically impossible to view all the material that is disseminated in their jurisdiction. They are 94See note 95 infra and accompanying text. 95de Grazia, note 84 supra at p. 615. "...

See Welbourn, note 86 supra, p. 30, n. 6. 96The decision to ban Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover was made by Summerfield overruling the Department's judicial officer.

Arnold J., in Esquire v. Walker (1945), 151 F. 2d 49, 55 (D.C.

Considering the wide publicity that the Post- master General achieved in his campaign against the alleged tide of hard-core pornog- raphy swamping the homes of America, de Grazia's remark that "such matter constitutes an almost negligible proportion of the literary material seized" is noteworthy. 101See, e.g., 39 U.S.C. 259a (1958). 102See p. 246 infra where we discuss the judicial treatment of pornography. 103Kansas Gen.

Thus books such as Richard Wright's Native Son are banned, not in a Deep South city, but by a censorship board of a Northern town.1'4 Several states and municipalities have devised techniques that deserve examination. These are the Massachusetts declaratory judgment pro- cedure,'05 and the classification system used for motion pictures in England,'0" several Canadian provinces,'07 and many American munici- palities. The Massachusetts declaratory judgment procedure seems to meet many of the requirements suggested by Chafee:108 the party defending the action is a person with strong financial interests and the resources to defend; usually he is the publisher; after judgment holding that the work is porno- graphic, the vendor is conclusively presumed to have knowledge of the finding in any subsequent criminal proceeding. There is a further advantage to this method over other systems of prior restraint: ". . . The determination is made in open court rather than in closed administration hearings, and the wasteful process of reviewing the entire output of the motion picture or publishing industry is eliminated."'09 Classification schemes would seem to have the great advantage of being designed specifically to protect those who need protection while allowing adults to read and view adult material. Although classification has only been applied to motion pictures, there is no legal or logical reason why it should not be applied to other forms of communication as well. In the first court test of age classification, Paramount Film Distributing Corp. v. City of Chicago,110 an ordinance giving the chief of police power to restrict to those over 21 years of age films which tended "toward creating a harmful impression in the minds of children, where such tendency as to the minds of adults would not exist""'l was held invalid. Some of the reasons for decision seem sound: the 21-year age limit was unreasonable;112 the limits 1o4Lockhart and McClure, note 77 supra, p. 319. 105Mass. Ann. Laws c. 272, ss. 28c-28h (1956). Wisconsin has a similar statute: Wis. Stat. s. 269, 565 (1957). According to a notewriter only three cases were reported under the 15-year-old Massachusetts statute: Note (1960), Wisconsin Law Review 309, 324.

The note-writers point out, how- ever, that "since this procedure strikes at the work before it has been circulated among the public, it is subject to the same objection as any other form of censorship-There is no chance to weight the initial public reaction." If the state's aim is to protect the young at all odds, this is not a disadvantage. The other major argument against a system of prior restraint is the inevitable delay with resulting harm to the communicator and to the public if the communicator, unhappy with the censor's decision, decides to pursue judicial remedies. See Times Film Corp. v. Chicago (1960), 365 U.S. 43, 73, per Warren, C. J. dissenting. 110(1959) 172 F. Supp. 69 (N.D.

The final reason goes to the heart of the problem. In the court's view, a motion picture could not be obscene for children and decent for adults."3 This is clearly wrong, both on grounds of precedent and logic. Courts have often recognized that the nature of the audience is important in determining whether or not impugned material is pornographic."4 For it is common knowledge that children and young adolescents react in a manner radically different from adults to the same material. Assuming a carefully drafted ordinance, the note-writers are agreed that age classification procedures are constitutional."' The practical objections to the procedure are its cost; the possibility that it may lodge more arbitrary power in the hands of the censors; the fact that theatre owners or book- sellers may have difficulty in determining the age of their customers; and the danger that publishers, striving to reach the widest markets, may limit their material to what will be certified for juvenile consumption, thus restricting entertainment available to adults;116 but these objections do not seem insuperable. The problem of cost raises the basic question whether the potential danger to juveniles justifies the expense involved in a system of prior restraint and, furthermore, assuming the necessity of state action, whether age classification schemes are the most efficient and economical methods available to achieve the ends sought. We must postpone a conclusion on this question until we have considered other censorship methods that have been used. But the remaining objections can be discussed now. All censorship gives the censor relatively arbitrary power; age classification limits the reach of his power so 113Paramount Film Distributing Corp. v. City of Chicago (1959), 172 F. Supp. 69, 71 (N.D. Ill.). 114U.S. v. 31 Photographs (1957), 156 F. Supp. 350 (S.D.N.Y.). 115The interest of the state in the welfare of children is strong: it is more likely that children rather than adults are harmed by exposure to pornography; age classification does not restrict content of speech-it involves a limitation of the character of the audience only.

In Police Commissioners of Baltimore City et al. v. Siegel Enterprises (1960), 162 A. 2d 727 (certiorari denied (1960), 5 L. Ed. 2d 225), the Maryland Court of Appeals held unconstitutional a section of a state statute making it unlawful to wilfully sell or distribute to any child below the age of 18 years any publication composed principally of pictures which was devoted to the exploitation of violent bloodshed, lust, or immorality or which for such child was obscene. The court advances two grounds for decision: (1) because newspapers were exempted, the state has made an arbitrary and unreasonable classifica- tion, this ground does not affect the argument in favour of the constitutional validity of age classification; (2) the standard of criminality was so vague that an honest distributor of publications could not know when he might be held to have ignored the prohibition. Query whether the standard in this statute is more indefinite than that in Roth v. U.S. (1957), 354 U.S. 476. In any case if, as we recommend, publications dangerous to youngsters were labelled, the distributor would not face the risk suggested by the court in the Siegel Enterprises Case. 116Note (1957), 71 Harvard Law Review 326, 342.</page><page sequence="18">246 THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL that it cannot unjustifiably affect the reading and viewing of adults. Further- more, the burden on the theatre owner or the bookseller could be extremely light. He would be penalized only if he knowingly or recklessly sold to a person under the prescribed age. The real burden should be on the juvenile. There is no injustice in punishing those who acquire something they know they are not entitled to acquire. The danger that note-writers attribute to an age classification system-that the owners of the mass media will attempt to reach the widest audience-is not a great threat. In the motion picture, on television and radio, what the note-writers foresee as a possible danger is a present reality. We are told that the economics of the motion picture industry is such that an age classification scheme with adults-only pictures would be ruinous."7 In light of the experience in jurisdictions that do have this system we may respectfully query the validity of this view. The state can, of course, rely on general obscenity statutes which make criminal the selling or distributing of pornographic material. The judicial definition of pornography by American courtss18 has been greatly affected by the First Amendment guarantee of free speech which, at the very least, requires affirmative grounds for governmental interference with communica- tions. Because of the constitutional directives, the Supreme Court in Roth v. United States,"' approved this test: does the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeal to the prurient interest of the average contemporary American?120 In Butler v. Michiganl21 the Supreme Court had invalidated a statute penalizing the dissemination to the general public of a book found to have a potentially harmful effect upon children. Many lay persons felt that the judiciary, in its desire to protect the legitimate interests of the adult citizen to see and read adult material, had given in- sufficient weight to the need to protect juveniles. Partly as a result of this feeling there has developed a tremendous amount of extra-legal censorship. For the moment, our concern is with extra-legal censorship by official agencies. As we will see,122 there is a close connection between these agencies and private groups. That officers of the government should engage in activities known by them to be illegalP28 is shocking in a country that prides 117Address by Geoffrey Shurlock, Director of Production Code Administration, Federation of Motion Picture Councils, Inc., Convention, St. Louis, April 20, 1956.

Furthermore, the methods used in this kind of censorship are often reprehensible,125 and the actions of the censors can have a nationwide impact.126 Yet secrecy veils the rationale of the choices that are made. The officials who engage in extra-legal censorship often rely upon lists prepared by private groups.127 These groups have affected the content of communica- tion not only in this manner, but also by their direct pressure on the mass media. In the field of literature the most publicized organization at work is the National Organization for Decent Literature.128 Through its detailed organization in many Roman Catholic dioceses and parishes, canvassing teams are appointed to call upon dealers ...; they explain the NODL's crusade and request each dealer's . . . promise to withdraw from sale all publications appearing on the NODL's lists.

In all of this there frequently is at least an implied threat of a general boycott against the dealer who refuses to cooperate.129 The wisdom shown by the extra-legal private censors has been no greater than that exhibited by the official censor. We are told that C. S. Forester's The African Queen and Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms, among others, appear on the NODL lists."30 Semper fidelis! 124We have seen this disregard of the law in other censorship situations. See 242 supra. 125"When police officials in one... town could not legally prevent a drive-in theatre from exhibiting a film which the officials considered objectionable, they threatened to prosecute patrons of the drive-in for fornication.

Since it is obviously impossible for a publisher to print two editions-one for Detroit and Wayne County and other cities using the Detroit lists, and the other for the rest of the country- the Detroit censor bureau and the assistant prosecuting attorney for Wayne county are able to this extent to censor literature for the entire country." Note 77 supra, p. 316. As late as June, 1957, the Detroit list was still being used by other cities. See (1957) 71 Harvard Law Review 326, 351, n. 176. 127This practice is evidently declining. Lockhart and McClure, note 23 supra, pp. 7-9. 128According to Lockhart and McClure (ibid., p. 6), the NODL began to decline as a potent force after May, 1957. However, a new national organization, the Citizens for Decent Literature, was formed in February, 1960: ibid., p. 10. 129Lockhart and McClure, note 77 supra, pp. 309-10. The authors report that 300 to 750 titles of paper-bound books may be withdrawn in those communities in which the NODL is successful. The NODL has been reported as saying that it concentrates on magazines and paper- bound books because juveniles can readily obtain them: Note (1957), 71 Harvard Law Review 326, 364. Unfortunately, many adults including university students and law professors find paper-bound books excellent because of their relatively low price. 130Lockhart and McClure, note 77 supra, p. 318.</page><page sequence="20">248 THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL In the motion picture field, the counterpart of NODL is the National Legion of Decency. Other groups have also applied continuous pressure or assistance, depending upon one's point of view. In any case, the motion picture, television, radio, and comic book industries all have codes to control the material that will be communicated to the public. As some legislators consider self-regulation by the mass media to be the best form of control,131 this method deserves examination. Self-regulation offers the one great advantage of saving the taxpayer money that would be necessary for official forms of control.132 Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that those in control of the media possess or have in their employ persons with expert knowledge of the effects of communi- cation. The results of self-regulation should be better than what has been accomplished by the official censors. We are told that the comics have been cleaned up since a code with teeth was adopted.a33 And there is not much sex on radio or television.134 The sex that has been portrayed in motion pictures is minute compared with the promises of it that have been made in advertisements.a35 Despite self-regulation, despite censorship and obscenity laws, the fact remains that many complaints are made about the dissemina- tion of unsuitable material.136 Perhaps the moral is that it is impossible to please all the people all the time. But this is what the industries where self-regulation is in force have tried to do. And they have achieved something: their product tends to be as bland as "Junket" and as stimulating.137 IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS One of the arguments advanced for more censorship, obscenity laws with more drastic penalties, and stricter codes of self-regulation is that exposure to obscene material is a factor in juvenile delinquency. In the publications and statements discussing the effects of obscenity, there has been no uniform definition of the term. In this paper, for purposes of clarification, we 131See statement of Senator Kefauver, Hearings of the Senate Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. (1955), p. 71. 132Some official control would still be necessary, so that the savings would not be complete. 133Murphy, "A Seal of Approval for Comic Books" (1955), 19 Federal Probation 19. Mr. Murphy is the code administrator. 1340ff-colour jokes occasionally heard on national television programmes do not come within anyone's definition of obscenity. 135For a study of the Code in operation in the case of "Happy Anniversary" see the New York Times, Oct. 30, 1959, p. 33, col. 2; Nov. 6, 1959, p. 23, col. 1; Nov. 10, 1959, p. 55, col. 6; Nov. 11, 1959, p. 41, col. 1.

We used the term pornography to describe communications that would be considered obscene by judicial standards. There have been no scientific studies showing that exposure to obscenity is a causal factor in juvenile delinquency. The few studies examining relationships between the mass media and juvenile delinquency were rela- tively inconclusive: those that were interpreted as showing a significant relationship have been so severely criticized-with justification-that it is only fair to ignore them. Clinicians have expressed conflicting views. Their views range from pronouncements that exposure to hard-core pornography may not be detrimental-may in fact be beneficial-to the potential sex offender, to the suggestion that even the normal child can be adversely affected by the mass media. The view that seems to be supported best by the evidence is that obscenity is unlikely to harm any but the disturbed juvenile, and that, even in this case, the effect is probably slight. If we accept this conclusion, we must ask whether the possible benefits of control- ing communications for the protection of special groups outweigh the hazards inherent in all control procedures. On balance, the intervention of the state seems necessary. Despite the paucity of evidence, there is a widespread popular belief that obscene and pornographic matter plays an important role in causing juvenile delin- quency. Furthermore, parents who share the popular belief lack the ability to control the content of communications that their children are exposed to. In their praiseworthy desire to protect the freedom of the adult to read and see adult material, the courts have invalidated legislation designed to protect children at all costs. Several groups feel that, as a result, there is inadequate protection of the young. To remedy this, many public officials knowingly engage in extra-legal censorship, using methods that are often despicable. They are encouraged and assisted by private groups who also proclaim that their intention is to protect the young. There is no question that society is injured by the lawless action of state officials and the exercise of police powers by private groups; whereas the danger that is avoided-the possible harm to juveniles-is indefinite and probably not very significant. Nor can self-regulation by the public mass media be looked to as a complete and effective alternative to state action. The mass media would require the assistance of the state to enforce the most logical method of control, age classification. Furthermore, the results of self-regulation in those media which have developed codes are unsatisfactory: the products tend to be bland; in any case the complaints of improper material in the mass media continue unabated. Assuming the desirability of governmental control, we must decide what level of government-federal, state, or municipal-should exercise the power. This question raises important issues of federalism. At the present</page><page sequence="22">250 THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL time we have all levels of government acting in the field, with unfortunate and sometimes ludicrous results. Books that in one jurisdiction circulate freely are proscribed in another. In a time when, we are told, large numbers of Americans move from one end of the country to the other, it may be asked why material that would not be harmful to them in one place would suddenly be dangerous in another. Small governmental units lack the resources to perform control functions adequately. Furthermore, the fact is that certain key cities can affect the content of communications in other jurisdictions. And the citizens of these latter jurisdictions do not have an affective manner of participating in the decision of what they will be allowed to see or read. For these reasons, municipalities should be divested of all censorship functions. The choice that is left is between state and federal control.38a Mr. Justice Harlan, in urging that the censorship function should be reserved for the states, claims that federal control would create a greater danger to civil liberties.a39 Perhaps he is right. But if three states such as New York, California, and Pennsylvania were to declare a book obscene despite the contrary conclusion of other states, would any publisher find it profitable to sell the book? Would not those states in fact dictate to the rest of the nation what would be read? And this would be done, moreover, without any power on the part of citizens in other states to affect the action. Mass communications are not local problems; national action is necessary if an adequate system of control is to be developed. And national action would enhance one of the great advantages of a method of prior restraint-a single decision frees the way for publication of the examined material without danger to the publisher anywhere in the country. But we have seen that present methods of governmental control are unsatisfactory. Our aim then must be to devise a procedure that will not restrict the flow of adult material to adult readers and viewers, and yet will protect juveniles. A system of age classification would seem to offer the best hope. Age classification procedures have been used in several jurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere, but only for motion pictures. Even that use has been criticized as impractical and as containing some of the dangers inherent in any scheme of prior restraint. Many of these objections, however, do not apply to the formulation that will be set out presently in this paper. Age classification schemes could be used in media other than motion pictures. Books and magazines could be imprinted with a special sign indicating that they were not to be sold or given to anyone under a specified age. But there is no way of absolutely controlling who will see or hear what programme on radio or television. Once we recognize that total control is an impossibility the only solution-and the one that has been adopted, but 138The federal government could act on the basis of its postal and commerce clause powers. 139Roth v.

He would only be liable if he knowingly or recklessly sold or offered prohibited material to a juvenile under the prescribed age.141 The argument that an age classification scheme would entail great cost seems difficult to counter. One way of lowering costs would be to allow a communicator the option of submitting or not submitting his material for review. Communication clearly intended for adults only prob- ably would not be submitted. Many firms in the communication industry now contribute to the costs of policing self-regulating in their field. An age classification scheme should lessen the need for and the expense of extensive self-regulation. There would be no undue burden on the mass media if they were required to meet some of the costs of the new system. Any procedure, no matter how rational, will not work if the persons exercising control lack proper qualifications. If our aim is to safeguard juveniles, the control agency must be staffed with experts who can at least offer an informed guess about the possible harmful effects to juveniles of the material that is being reviewed. We also need experts who understand the problems of the communications industries, and yet are independent of the industries. And lastly we must have experts who are not so tied to their own narrow specialty that they are unfamiliar with works of literature and art that are known to the literate members of the community. For all these reasons we recommend that the proposed censorship board be staffed by child psychologists, child psychiatrists, educators, communications experts, and teachers of English drawn from universities. Members of this board should be employed on a part-time basis so that they will be as free as possible from political and other pressures. One of the hazards of a system of prior restraint such as we propose is that decisions are made in secret. Secrecy helps to explain much of the arbitrariness and lawlessness that exists in this field. The reasons that usually have been advanced for the need for secrecy-the danger of publicizing obscene or pornographic material-seem relatively weak, especially when we consider that juveniles will be unable to obtain material that the board decides is obscene. As a preventive of the evils of secrecy we recommend the essentials of due process: counsel with the right to submit evidence and make arguments and a decision that can be examined by the public. 140We know that some juveniles at least are not asleep. See p. 230 supra. If porno- graphy is shown, the producers would be subject to the ordinary criminal sanctions. However, we feel that radio and television should be allowed to present adult programmes in the late evening even if the content of these programmes would be obscene according to our definition. One does not have to accept in its entirety Legman's thesis that the failure of America to come to terms with the sexual aspects of life is reflected in this country's violence. See Legman, Love and Death: A Study in Censorship (1949). Yet the doubts linger on. 141Cf. Smith v. California (1959), 361 U.S. 147, which holds that scienter is con- stitutionally required to support an obscenity conviction.</page><page sequence="24">252 THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL A system of age classification is not designed, nor is it really able, to control materials disseminated by the private mass media. To a large extent the flow of pornography will still have to be controlled by the criminal law. The logical agency of the United States government to act in the federal aspects of the matter is the Department of Justice, not the Post Office. All censorship powers should be removed from the latter. Any person who sends pornography through the mails or into interstate commerce can be punished adequately by criminal sanctions. If we think that juveniles are more subject to harm from exposure to pornography than adults, the criminal sanctions can be altered easily by imposing a special penalty for knowingly or recklessly selling or giving such material to juveniles. Addi- tional control would result from penalties imposed for a communicator's failure to label his material. Our prime aim in recommending an age classification system is to allow the public mass media to produce work worthy of a great nation, and at the same time to protect children. The pressures of extra-legal censorship may be one factor that has produced much mediocrity. If the system we recom- mend adequately protects juveniles, there will no longer be a need for this censorship. At the present time the remedies of the communicator against extra-legal censorship are not too clear.142 For this reason we recommend that criminal sanctions be imposed if that censorship is by public officials. Civil sanctions such as a statutory right to an injunction and a suit for treble damages and all costs arising from that suit should be adequate to restrain extra-legal censorship by private groups.143 142See Note, "Liabilities of the Extra-Legal Censor" (1956), 5 Buffalo Law Review 328, and Note, "Entertainment: Public Pressures and the Law" (1957), 71 Harvard Law Review 326, 366. 143A study group composed of members of various religions has agreed that it is "un-American" for religious groups to attempt to impose their views on the general public by boycotting, picketing, etc. See "Religion and American Society," a report of the Fund for the Republic.
