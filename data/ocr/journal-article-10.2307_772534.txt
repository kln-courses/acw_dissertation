Jahr- hunderts als Symbol der Zeit, 255 pp., 64 ill., Salzburg: Otto Mueller Ver- lag, 1948. 48 sch. Verlust der Mitte is another book con- cerned with the decline of the Western World. The "decline" is discussed in terms of medicine, and our time is cor- respondingly likened to a human being, mortally ill. The approach is singular because the self-styled time doctor, the Viennese art historian Hans Sedlmayr, uses his art history as a science auxiliary to time medicine. The book is divided into three sections: "Symptoms," "Diag- nosis," and "Prognosis." In each of them art is seen essentially as a surface mani- festation, accessible to scientific measure- ment. The works of art provide the steps for the intelligent Tiefenpsychologe to descend into the core of time. In the progress of this journey the works of art seem to change in character and often in value. In many of them a hidden great- ness is revealed; others, frequently re- vered as stand-bys of value, come to ap- pear rather like propaganda communi- qu6s. It should be noted, however, at the outset, that a number of works of art taken on the trip into depth show a great deal of resistance and are definitely unwilling to be taken along. Verlust der Mitte can be understood to consist of two parts which are curi- ously interwoven. The leading one is purely speculative. It climaxes in the presentation of four ages of civilization which are determined by the particular relation of God and man which governs it. Western civilization alone entered upon the last age, "autonomous man," which began circa 1760. The other part of the book, of more immediate interest to art historians, pre- sents the evidence for the characterization of the "Fourth Age of Western Civiliza- tion," on which the entire work is fo- cused. This evidence is a discussion of 19th and 20th century art. The period from 1760 to the present is interpreted as a sequence of "surface styles" which are but manifestations of one basic style, in- timately connected with the abnormality which characterizes the fourth age of civilization. This main point of Sedl- mayr's is curiously "modern" and "re- actionary" at the same time. The art of the time from 1760 until about 1910, when the battle cries of the "modern movement in art" became loud enough to be given public attention, is customarily lumped together as the "eclectic period" and connected with weakness, lack of conviction, hypocrisy, degeneracy. Sedlmayr marks the 19th century in accordance with 20th century righteousness, only to turn about and condemn the moderns by calling their art degenerate-as has customarily been done with 19th century righteousness ever since the beginning of the modern movement. What must hurt the modern academician, however, is that here "mod- ern art" is not called degenerate because it is so different from the art of the 19th century, but because it is so much like it, and even worse, because it surpasses it in the directness of the manifestations of decay. Sedlmayr attempts to show the inner unity of the two hostile movements by uncovering the stylistic motif which he thinks underlies all artistic manifesta- tions of the period: that is the Verlust der Mitte, the invisible but ever present center which is-the very absence of a center, the unit of nothingness in relation to which modern works of art should be seen to reveal their true identity and their possible greatness. Verlust der Mitte has, as its immediate consequence, brought along "fear," "mel- ancholy," and "loss of reality," the chief</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 297 themes of modern art. In their wake has come about the unbelievable: the de- struction of the image of man. If in contemporary art man appears at all as the subject of painting and sculpture, the arts which have "since the late neolithi- cum" been devoted to his representa- tion, he is shown in the most frightful distortions. The elevation of the frag- ment or the sketch to the rank of the completed work of art, the representa- tions of hopelessness, the dream world, the accent on the demonic, the cult of the alogical, sensuous escapism, they all ap- pear in various dominant phases of 19th century art and they all are significant of the main theme-Verlust der Mitte. But modern art, it may be countered, has also another theme, one of purity, logic, honesty and construction, a theme represented best in modern architecture and abstract painting and scuplture. Many even hold that this theme alone is truly representative of the 20th century. Still it is exactly this purist theme which is used again and again by Sedl- mayr to demonstrate the connection be- tween Verlust der Mitte and the art of the period. Pure painting and pure sculp- ture and pure architecture, necessarily denying all representation in art, have been the most brazen forces in the at- tack upon the image of man. The ag- gressive incomprehensibility, the com- mitment to a program or manifesto, the absence of a frame or of any bearings ("pure" paintings can be turned upside down without causing any confusion to their order, "pure" architecture is not connected with the ground, all building tasks are alike, the laws of gravity seem defied), all point towards a vociferous dissertation on Verlust der Mitte as the true subject matter of abstract art. Sedlmayr does not rest his argument here. He sees in the idea of purity or autonomy itself a reflection of the age of "autonomous man," separated from God. The autonomy of the arts means first of all a falling apart of the traditional con- cept of "archi-tecture," the connubium of all the arts which before 1760 had combined to create the Gesammtkunst- werk of the church, the castle, the cathe- dral. In painting and sculpture the seem- ing freedom of art gained by the cher- ished autonomy led into slavery-the work of art became subservient to the dictates of the material and the tech- nique; in architecture it leads to self destruction. The revolution of autonomous archi- tecture, according to Sedlmayr, who here, admittedly, only re-evaluates a "discov- ery" made by Emil Kaufmann, began in the 18th century, with the work of the French architect Ledoux. Ledoux was the first to abandon the anthropomorphism of classic architecture and to reduce architecture to an arrangement of basic stereometric forms. In the course of the 19th century this "pure architecture" was driven underground; consequently the "surface styles" present us with dead buildings and "applied" ornament, illustrating in their variety a number of more or less admirable escapisms. In the 20th century, the factory having become the leading building task of the period, "pure architecture" re-emerged. In the 1920's Le Corbusier was able to an- nounce triumphantly the death Qf archi- tecture and the victory of the machine, that is, the complete realization of au- tonomy in architecture. An amazing wealth of startling ideas and daring conclusions presented in the book makes it impossible to point out the many situations of sudden insight in which the reader finds himself, nor the at least equally frequent situations of shock and surprise over the most ruth- less generalizations. It would seem that the principle of Verlust der Mitte can be applied most successfully to works of art created after about 1830 (the year in which, according to Jakob Burckhardt, "everything began to get worse"). A re- markable example of the applicability of the principle is found in a casual remark concerning Seurat. Sedlmayr finds the essence of his work not in its ab-</page><page sequence="3">298 COLLEGE ART JOURNAL stract construction but in the seemingly analogous subordination of the human anatomy to stereometric forms ("... man appears like a wooden puppet ..."). By this shift of accent the tragic power of Seurat's work which so often is only ob- scured by the customary "explanations" of its formal composition, is properly accented. In a similar manner, Sedlmayr points towards a "magic strangeness" in the work of Cezanne: ". . . there is ai state of natural experience which some- what corresponds to it. It is that rare moment between waking and being fully awake, in which, so to speak, only the eye is awake while the intellect is still at rest ..." But when Sedlmayr speaks of the period of 1760, which to him represents the most significant beginning of the "autonomy of man," the term Verlust der Mitte seems out of place. The work of Ledoux is not really comparable to the work of Le Corbusier, in spite of the inviting alliteration. It looks rather like a stage set for Mozart's Magic Flute trans- posed into architecture, and not at all like a machine a vivre. When Goya and George Grosz are connected to illustrate the span of the history of the destruc- tion of the image of man, one can only see the gulf which separates them. And it hurts when it is suggested that a pic- ture by Turner can be reversed in the manner of a cubist abstraction. The further away from the 19th cen- tury Sedlmayr's examples are chosen the more painful appears the linkage to Ver- lust der Mitte, or any geistesgeschicht- liche Situation altogether. One must in- deed see the past with modern eyes to discover more than a surface relationship between the "demonism" of late roman- esque art and of expressionism. And the connection of an assumed "two-dimen- sionality" of English art to a seemingly natural English "disinterest" in the im- age of man, is so monstrous a simplifi- cation that one is tempted to call it a symptom of the author's own Ve'rlust der Mitte. Examples of this sort show drastically the danger of the Viennese method of Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte. On the other hand, one is surprised to find Geistesgeschichte such a suitable medium in the unravelling of the con- tradictions of 19th and 20th century art. Perhaps it is because Sedlmayr takes the direct connection of Zeitgeist and art for granted in the analysis of all works of art that he overlooks the singularity with which 19th and 20th century works of art seem to live in such an aura. In Germany and Austria Mr. Sedl- mayr's work has raised a great deal of excitement of a nearly political nature. Its emphasis on the "degeneracy" of mod- ern art is reminiscent of the Nazi tenets concerning Entartete Kunst. And it is definitely unpleasant to read of a pro- posal for the investigation of the ethnic factors which have brought about the Verlust der Mitte; even if its scientific objectivity is assured so well that one does not exactly know whether Sedl- mayr in this connection thinks of the Jews or the English. Fortunately we are not, in America, subject to this added politico-emotional complication. The book represents, to the extent that it is concerned with art, a powerful challenge to the inveterate credo of the academism of the modern movement, it is a valuable aid in the understanding of the sequence of styles in the 19th and 20th centuries, and it contributes directly to the interpretation of the iconography of non-objective art.
