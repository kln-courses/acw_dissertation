<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART AND HISTORY1 ACH work of art is unique. It is the record of an experience in place and time. Its uniqueness enables the art historian to judge the people or person who made it and the date of its creation. Cultural qualities are so indelibly stamped upon art that we seldom stop to analyze them. We know instantly that this vase is Greek, that piece of sculpture is Indian, or a certain painting is Chinese. Pages of words would be needed to analyze our reactions and a poet to express them, for cultural qualities embody the intangibles and incommensurables of a people. Since art is an imaginative wedding of Content and Style (what the artist has to say and how he says it), some evi- dence stems from subject matter and its interpretation and some arises from characteristic rhythms and relationship of design. The date of a work of art is generally more approximate. We arrive at it by innumerable comparisons with known dated works. This is earlier and that is later, which fact indicates a process of change. The interpretation, however, of this con- tinuous change raises many problems for which no theory has furnished adequate answers. It may be slow in Egypt or fast in Greece. It may involve merely a change in a "style" from Greek archaic to decorated archaic, or a basic switch from a two- dimensional mode of visualization to a three-dimensional as in Greek archaic to classic. History is the record of experience happening in place and time. Mysteriously it moves and has its being through the dy- namic interplay between cultural traits and period character- istics. Culture has its roots deep in the soil and cannot be trans- ferred; civilization, in the sense here used, is conditioned by time and is measurable in terms of human knowledge. The two, culture and civilization, are constantly interacting to cre- ate each moment of history, and they are as inseparably wedded as content and style in a work of art. Consequently, each devel- opment is unique. Each must be evaluated independently be- 1 Editorial note: Rubbings of Chinese monuments which can be dated, through external circumstances, form a framework for the stylistic study of Chinese art.

There seem to be three irreducible criteria for evaluation. What is the nature of the self which has experience? What is the reaction to the knowable universe? What is postulated about the unknowable?3 These three have been given such various names that for the sake of brevity they will be termed "Nature,4 Man and God." If, for any work of art or any moment in history we can estimate the approximate approaches to each of these three, "Nature, Man, and God," and the relation between them, we will be coming to grips with the expressive significance of art and the mean- ings of history, in so far as that is ever achievable. At one time in history, and only then, there appears to be a kind of parallelism in the growth of civilizations. If we begin at the beginning, that is with the emergence of distinctive cul- tures from the matrix of the neolithic past, civilization seems to follow a pattern of successive stages. This process of change may be best observed in Greece, where the expansion of man's interests and powers of understanding passed through three phases, namely, intuitive apprehensions of man's mysterious en- vironment, rational generalizations about the universe, and lastly observation of actuality. This sequence seems to follow its own inner logic of the growth of the intellectual faculties from sim- plicity to complexity. Stated another way, man seeks to explain experience first in terms of belief, then in terms of reason, and finally in terms of empirical analysis. In the broadest pos- sible perspective of historical process this sequence represents a kind of larger framework with definite limitations and ca- pacities peculiar to each of the three approaches to life-the intuitive, the rational and the empirical. Just as these three words inadequately convey such a moun- tain-top view of historical change from primitive times to ad- 2 The cyclical theorists have distorted history on three counts: first, they took the Greek development of Archaic, Classic, and Hellenistic periods as a norm; secondly, they attempted to apply the so-called Greek cycle to other ancient civilizations; and lastly they assumed that the West European developments were later repeats of the pattern. 3 Obviously, these questions are not consciously formulated by man in many stages of development. They are manifested to us by their results. 4 "Nature" in this sense includes human beings as objects. 77</page><page sequence="3">vanced civilization, no single terms will indicate the correspond- ing approaches to art. For brevity, they will be called "idea- tional, idealistic and realistic" despite the loose and varied usages of these terms in art-history and in other fields of knowl- edge. These three approaches to representation were accompa- nied by three distinctive modes of visualization-ideographic shapes, generalized forms, and descriptive appearances. However, this theoretical and inherently logical process of change happened only once in ancient times, namely in Greece. The Egyptian and Near Eastern civilizations were arrested at the ideational level. India, in its Guptan period, developed logi- cal thinking and evolved an elaborate metaphysics, but a fully developed realistic stage was restrained by the cultural attitude toward matter and the absorption with religion. The Chinese development is a unique case on two counts. (1) It is the only continuous and relatively unbroken civiliza- tion from neolithic to modern times. (2) It is the only develop- ment remotely parallel to the Greek in terms of the mechanics of visualization-the linear shapes of an early phase, followed by a period of volumetric forms, and later by pictorial surfaces, representing the three stages of ideational, idealistic and realis- tic art.5 Between each of these, the mind of man, and there- fore his art, seems to shift into a new gear. These gear shifts occurred in China during the transitional periods of the Sui and Yuan dynasties, dividing Chinese history into three phases -the Pre-T'ang, the T'ang-Sung, and the Ming-Ch'ing. But, the parallelism between China and Greece is superficial and misleading for it concerns only the mechanics of visualiza- tion in their broadest aspects. The differences between them are greater than the similarities. In each case, the cultural traits profoundly modified the process of change. The mechanics of visualization merely establish a framework of reference for dating a work of art according to its period characteristics. Cul- ture and civilization are constantly interacting to produce dis- tinctive values which are unique. The cultural traits of any people are not easy to define or 5 The similar development in Japan in three steps was too dependent on China to be separately significant. 78</page><page sequence="4">to summarize6 because they stem from conceptions of "Nature, Man and God" and the relation between them which are par- ticular to any given culture or people. In every respect the Chinese seem to be opposed to the Greeks. Historically Greece passed through its development in about a thousand years and the principles of the past were sloughed off with each new discovery. The Chinese process of change was characterized by a kind of recreative traditionalism through four thousand years, and the principles of the past were constantly re-worked to meet the needs of the present. The most striking characteristics of Chinese painting have their roots in the ideational phase of the Pre-T'ang era, namely the emphasis on the essence of the idea, tendency toward isolation of motifs, primary dependence on linear rhythm, relationship of areas, importance of voids, integrity of the picture plane, and composition in terms of time. Yet, all of these were re-fashioned to express the later interests in plastic organic form, pictorial surface, space and light. Change was constant because the Chinese are a singularly in- ventive and imaginative people, but at the same time, they al- ways built reverently upon the past. Philosophically, the Chinese notion of the Tao contrasted violently with the Greek dichotomies of spirit and matter, hu- man and non-human, animate and inanimate, or unity and va- riety. To the question, what are "Nature, Man and God" the Chinese finally answered that they are one-the oneness of the Tao, unnameable, impersonal and mysterious.7 To the Greeks, man as the experiencing self was the center of the uni- verse. He created anthropomorphic gods in his own image and produced the sciences to explain "Nature." The Chinese never developed a religion of their own, probably because the tradi- tional preservation of ancestor worship satisfied the normal hu- man needs for religious practices. The borrowed religion of 6 The attempt was made in the author's Principles of Chinese Painting, Prince- ton University Press, 1947 and 1959, to which the reader is referred for a more complete statement. 7 Obviously, the notion of the Tao did not appear at the beginning of Chinese history and only became the conscious goal of the artists during the Sung period. Early civilizations have much in common, whether in magical practices, sacri- fices, polytheism, kingship, etc. Nevertheless, distinctive cultural tendencies were also present. It is significant that "Heaven" was impersonal and indefinite and that the notion of the Tao appears as early as the Chou period. 79</page><page sequence="5">Buddhism could not survive in the Chinese cultural soil and by the thirteenth century it became more Taoism than Bud- dhism in the form of the Ch'an doctrine. Similarly, the Chinese never developed the natural sciences, probably because the em- bryonic sciences of astrology, alchemy and geomancy were in the hands of the common people and through tradition contin- ued to be neglected by the scholars. Consequently the mystery of the universe needed an answer and the solution was the Tao which implied a kind of natural mysticism. This profoundly affected the creative imagination, the content of art, and even the design values. Instead of the Greek concentration on the anthropomorphic gods and human activities, the Chinese by Sung times preferred themes from the natural world-animals, birds, flowers, fish, insects and, above all, landscape which became the supreme theme of painting. If the Tao resides in all things, natural themes may manifest it and landscape may become a visible expression of an all-embracing universe within which man him- self is only a small part. Instead of the Greek cult of the body with its passion for the nude in all its physical and corporeal perfection, the Chinese eschewed the nude and sought those qualities in the human form which partook of the Tao. These were subtly suggested by concentration on the inner spirit rather than on the outward appearance and by the use of rhythm akin to those of the nat- ural realm. The Ming writers finally codified these rhythms into the sixteen kinds of drapery strokes named bamboo leaf, swirling water, old firewood, etc. The conception of the Tao required the harmony of the universe and the relation of man to all things. However, this harmony was not static because the Tao mani- fests itself in the eternal flux of being and becoming and in the interplay between Yin-Yang opposites-dominant and sub- ordinate ("host and guest"), solid and void, dense and sparse, thick and thin, vertical and horizontal, etc., all of which mu- tually need one another. This resulted in an equilibrium of forces instead of the more static Greek unity with its notes of variety and instead of the greater Greek dependence on ge- ometry for harmony. Greek reason led to laws of proportion and order through balance while Chinese intuition and imagi- 80</page><page sequence="6">nation emphasized principles of growth and the coherence of a moving focus. Lastly, the significance of the non-existent, that is of voids in painting, was the most obvious and yet elusive manifesta- tion of the Tao. The Greeks concentrated on the solids while the Chinese were supremely aware of the intervals of void even in their early painting. In the Southern Sung period the solids were actually obliterated and the Ch'i or spirit voids said more than the solids. The Greeks prized clarity, completeness and measurability while the Chinese valued simplification, sugges- tion and emptiness-"to say much with little" and to evoke the intangible and incommensurable overtones of the Tao. As- suredly, the cultural differences are greater than the similarities of the process of change in these two developments. Nevertheless the basic development of Chinese art and his- tory through the ideational, idealistic and realistic phases must be clearly recognized since it furnishes a framework of refer- ence both for dating works of art and for judging foreign in- fluences. Otherwise we shall fall into the prevalent errors of reading realistic principles into Han art or of interpreting the Six Dynasties as a "Buddhist Gothic" period. Because the Greeks first evolved logical thinking and empirical method, their development was not subjected to influences from more advanced civilizations. The Chinese process of change was so traditionally slow that during the ideational phase it experi- enced the impact of diluted Hellenistic realism in the Han dynasty and of Guptan idealism in the Six Dynasties. The prob- lems of foreign influence are many-the kind of influence, whether by importation or conquest, the length of time in- volved, the cultural contrasts between the two parties leading to resistance or assimilation, and the disparity between them in terms of civilization. It seems to be axiomatic in history that the power to assimilate is determined by the mind of the age. Since the clock of civilization cannot be suddenly pushed for- ward, the receiving society transforms the foreign material in terms of its own mechanics of visualization and cultural traits. In spite of these foreign influences Chinese art remained es- sentially ideational in character until T'ang times. During this long phase of history, change was continuous from the Shang "sacrificial-auguristic" approach to life to the theological inter- 81</page><page sequence="7">ests of the Six Dynasties. This fact requires a further division of Chinese history into shorter periods but we must be on guard against confusing these with the basic gear shifts of the idea- tional, idealistic and realistic sequence. The problem is partly semantic since we lack significant terms to identify the lesser changes. One cyclical interpretation has divided Chinese art history into four repetitive cycles: Shang, Chou and Warring States; Han, Three Kingdoms, and Six Dynasties; T'ang, North- ern Sung and Southern Sung; and finally Y'uan, Ming and Ch'ing. It is incontestable that styles pass through developments. For example, the clear and simple motifs of the Shang period began to lose their significance and became more decorative in Chou times and finally reached an elaborate and involved multiplicity during the Warring States; the normative state- ments of plastic organic forms of T'ang times are further inves- tigated in terms of the principles of nature in the Northern Sung period and become introspectively simplified and sug- gestive during Southern Sung. But to label the Warring States and Southern Sung "baroque" is both semantically misleading and stylistically incomprehensible whether the term is meant to refer to a late development of an artistic language or to the visual realism of the seventeenth century in Europe. The rich- ness of Warring States' style depended on multiplicity of motifs, decorative elaboration and design convolutions which have noth- ing in common with diversity, irregularity and complexity of motifs derived from actual appearance nor with the organiza- tion of forms in lighted space. The Warring States' motifs re- mained ideational in character. Moreover, the elements of Southern Sung style have none of the qualities of visual ap- pearance but were derived from typical and generic principles and the voids were used to divide spatial distance into compart- ments rather than to create the spatial fusion of the Baroque seventeenth century. In fact, "baroque" in the seventeenth cen- tury sense should not be applied to either the Ming-Ch'ing or the Hellenistic style since they operate according to realistic principles derived from nature instead of the Baroque aware- ness of actual visual appearance.8 8 For criticism of various theories of style see Meyer Shapiro's Style, in Kroeber, Anthropology Today, 1953. 82</page><page sequence="8">This comment on the cyclical growth of "styles" has been necessary in order to isolate the larger framework of historical process herein applied to China. Because of its cultural traits, especially traditionalism, and the impacts of foreign influences, Chinese history is unusually baffling. An axiom of art-history is that the kind of representation is conditioned by the kind of approach to Nature.9 It is to be hoped that this framework of reference based on the growth of the mind and the conse- quent mechanics of visualization will provide a sounder foun- dation for future connoisseurship in the field. At the same time it must be remembered that culturally speaking every period, indeed every work of art, is unique and the final evaluation must be the test of "Nature, Man and God." George Rowley 9 For example, Byzantine art is flat and schematic, but is not ideational. It is de-naturalized, based on Hellenistic realism, because the new approach to life was iconic, dogmatic, and transcendental. 83</page></plain_text>
