<plain_text><page sequence="1">Imagined Territory: The Writing of Wetlands William Howarth The odd thing, in fact, about literature as an imagined territory is that there are apparently no natural limits and hence, it would seem, there are apparently no natural limits to the field of literary criticism. Stephen Greenblatt and Giles Gunning1 I. Place and Text Defining literature as imagined territory is an old habit among academic critics. Early mimetic theories of art distinguish world from text, with text neatiy smoothing the earth's tangle, and this distinction has long elevated human status: we think, therefore we are sovereign; we are conscious and imaginative, hence the world is our oyster to pluck, to crack, to discard, to remake. Granted dominion for two millennia, that brand of humanism has produced a world with fewer oysters, crowded freeways, global warming, and critics who say "there are apparently no natural limits to the field of literary criticism." My purpose in this essay is to suggest that natural limits are inescapable, especially when writers use geographic metaphors or imagine physical places. I also argue that long-proclaimed distinctions between place and person, self and other, sustain the illusions known as love or reverence for nature. Nature does not need our love, but we surely need its life and health. If we accept the hard fact of natural limits, relations between terrain and imagination may turn less dominant, more respectful?bearing in mind that respect means to re-vision, or look again, which should be the purpose of critical effort. My epigraph is from Redrawing the Boundaries: The Transformation of Literary Studies, a book that raises "far-reaching questions about disciplin ary mapping" (RTB 3), yet rarely examines its own geo-rhetoric. Schol ars have long used spatial metaphors to fence the pastures of intellect: one occupies a domain, province, or field of knowledge, depending on rank and ambition.

New Literary History, 1999, 30: 509-539</page><page sequence="2">510 NEW LITERARY HISTORY staked with many claims about canon, period, and authorship.2 This "imagined territory" is ostensibly beyond natural limits because its basis "is not space or territory but procedure" (RTB 8). Yet procedure is spatial, since it is a series of steps, a way of performing, to move in a desired direction. If our existence is so firmly bounded by space and time, what can have no natural limits? Name any object of fantasy?a centaur, Little Nell, El Dorado?and we have fictions made of natural elements. In the view of Canadian novelist Robertson Davies, imagination is "a good horse to carry you over the ground?not a flying carpet to set you free from probability."3 Only those who know litde of nature think imagination can surpass it. Researchers peer every day into mitochon dria or galaxies, and glimpse a nature far stranger than any previous imagining. One poet readily grasped this insight, without the benefit of radio telescopes. In 1862 Emily Dickinson sent Thomas Wentworth Higginson, an editor in Boston, some of her early poems. Baffled by their formal oddities, Higginson wrote a polite letter of praise and inquired about her background. Dickinson replied, "You ask of my companions. Hills, sir, and the sundown, and a dog large as myself, that my father bought me. They are better than beings because they know, but do not tell; and the noise in the pool at noon excels my piano."4 Her enigmatic response mocks his query about companions, by which he meant the friends or mentors who shaped her writings. Her answer takes a new slant: my companions are not human. In the hills, sundown, and dog (a place, time, and creature) she finds associates who are "better than beings [humans], because they know, but do not tell."This praise expresses no disregard for humans, only respect for nature's prescience. Her silent, knowing companions "do not tell" because they have no words or numbers. Yet eloquence has many forms; hence the "noise in the pool at noon" excels her "piano," the tunes she makes in verse.5 The assertion that knowledge is not solely human has long sustained religion and philosophy. To believers, the divine or natural forces always know more, and even skeptics agree that true knowledge begins with recognizing ignorance. Dickinson appears to side with her contempo rary Emerson, who saw the relation between subject and object, mind and matter, as a process of correspondence, the interaction or reciprocity that resembles letters going back and forth, to exchange intelligence or secrets.6 Dickinson calls her poetry "my letter to the World / That never wrote to me" (441), which again describes language as a human way of knowing and representing, while the world (nature) uses silence. Emerson said that language verifies human primacy, but Dickinson sees words as anterior to life.7 From her silent companions she learns what nature already knows, has splendidly assembled before she happens by. The work</page><page sequence="3">IMAGINED TERRITORY 511 of her poems resembles archaeology, probing to find lost places: an acre with four trees, the western hills, a plank in the kitchen floor. Places write upon the mind, and poets learn to read them. Words alone cannot make a place, any more than imagination creates territory.8 Readings of places have occupied many American writers, who over five centuries have witnessed drastic changes in their continent; and since 1990 a school of ecocritics has begun to examine place-centered texts, mainly in the Anglo-American canon. In their fledgling years, ecocritics have shared only a loose affinity. Some advocate green politics, while others evangelize for natural theology. Many long to replace literary and cultural theory with pragmatic readings, ethics favored over aesthetics. To date few have explored the highly relevant fields of ecology, geography, and environmental history. Joyce Carol Oates has mocked nature-writers for "a painfully limited set of responses . . . REVERENCE, AWE, PIETY, MYSTICAL ONENESS," and ecocritics too often echo that laudatory tone. Excluded from Redrawing the Boundaries, ecocritics have yet to persuade others that "mapping fields" also de mands serious study of the relations between word and land, text and place. To recognize and accept ecocritical practice, readers will need to agree that place functions as a cultural and textual paradigm.9 Place differs from the geometrical idea of space, a set of points or dimensions that measure distance, area, and volume. Space has a few applied meanings, such as defining where we park, how long to wait, or the blank between these lines of type; but space is an abstraction with limited semantic reach. Place animates a broader range of human enterprise, from mathematics and logic to athletic contests. Place sustains fundamental concepts of time and space, the earth and maps, forms of writing, the sacred and profane, gardens and buildings, social order and disorder, political status, region and nation. This widely influential word has a simple, domestic origin, the neighborhoods of early Athens and Rome. In Greek, two words signified location: topos and plateia (from platus, broad). A plateia (plattia, in Latin) was an open square or courtyard, a shared commons surrounded by private houses. As Rome expanded, its imperial forms spread throughout Europe, creating a townscape whose components became the visual grammar of civilization: aqueduct, forum, bath, and plattia. The locals developed other pronunciations: piazza, plats, plaza, forerunners of Anglo-Norman place, an open space ringed by houses. By the Renaissance, place signified doubly: it meant any physical location (a piece or plot of land) but also social position or status, because land produced wealth. To geographers, place defined external spaces where people dwell, whether in house, village, or city; and internal spaces of those structures, such as a hall, stairs, or room. In the</page><page sequence="4">512 NEW LITERARY HISTORY formal study of philosophy, history, or literature, place was a defined or bounded part of space, whether in the heavens or a book: a common place book was full of many places, lines copied from other books. The Greek topos also applied: topikos, of a place, became matter for rhetori cians, a commonplace argument, as in Aristotle's Topics. From 1500 on, place acquired especially intricate social meanings: to know one's place was to behave with proper manners; to put someone in their place was to rebuff or rebuke (in current slang, to put down) ; to be a place-man was to maintain social order. In the French court, status meant proximity: the Second Lord of the Stairs, the First Lord of the Antechamber; while ambitious English courtiers knew by heart the iron law of place-keeping: "Four ways at court to win men's grace / To lie, to laugh, to flatter, to face." These meanings survive today in the notion of placement, used in schools and sports to rank performers. Place marks space and time, as events are said to take place; and by this extension, it slips from noun to verb and acquires transitive force, meaning to position, arrange, recog nize, identify, and categorize.10 Across twenty-five centuries, a city square becomes a trope for mental activity, the means of organizing percep tions into knowledge. Places write upon the mind: what began as a physical object becomes in time the work of subjectivity. As a paradigm, place is physical, social, and intellectual; it surrounds constructions like race, gender, or class because they must stand or transpire somewhere, within a recognizable place, though that place may range from the dateline of journalism or the venue of law to the poet's pleasure in setting: Merrill's changing light at Sandover, Eliot's wasteland, Masters' riverscape, Auden's limestone country. While the ways that places look, smell, and baffle have long intrigued writers, they are of less apparent interest to critical readers. Ecocritics could dispel that apathy by attending closely to textual places, neither skipping irritably over pages of place-description, nor casually accepting how we think we see them. II. Between Earth and Water James Hamilton-Paterson begins Playing with Water, his memoir of several years spent on a Philippine island, by acknowledging that such accounts are multi-local: "The places a writer writes are always some where else. He may describe a journey, a foreign land; but no matter how faithfully he disposes his rocks and trees, his tokens of difference and the humdrum exotica he comes to love, certain delinquent breezes drift through landscape and writer alike, dishevelling things at their root."11 The "somewhere else" may be remembered or invented; it is</page><page sequence="5">IMAGINED TERRITORY 513 foreign matter that writers make familiar, even as surprises and acci dents, the "delinquent breezes" that stir and freshen a story, will change its direction and meaning. Literary places are never empty because they have implied observers, trying to read the stories written there. Place alone does not determine text, since the many islands, mountains, and oceans in literature are infinitely varied. Yet one locale stands out because it has a long history of ambiguous and also evolving cultural status: the wetiand, in its manifold guises of bog, fen, marsh, or swamp. For thousands of years, the human attitude toward wedands was consistently negative: they were read as dangerous, useless, fearful, filthy, diseased, noxious. Then perceptions began to change in the 1700s, gradually turning toward more positive values of beauty, fertility, variety, utility, and fluidity. Emily Dickinson covers the entire historical spectrum in a quatrain: "Sweet is the swamp with its secrets, / Until we meet a snake; / 'Tis then we sigh for houses, / And our departure take" (1740). Later writers weigh in with their own readings. In his elegy, "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," Walt Whitman agrees that a cedar swamp has "deep secluded recesses," but there lives the hermit thrush, a solitary daemon whose song assuages grief and despair. To Willa Cather and Ernest Hemingway, human involvement with wedands suggests tragic decline and spiritual ruin. In A Lost Lady and "Big Two Hearted River," characters who drain marshes or fish in cedar swamps must struggle against self-defeat and insanity. Recent authors are more cheerfully morbid; in Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, Annie Dillard delights to wade in river marshes and watch a "giant waterbug" suck the life from hapless frogs. For John McPhee, the "amphibious new world" of Atchafalaya Bayou is a snake-infested morass where New Orleans began, willy-nilly.12 How and why these shifts occur is a problem that vexes today's cultural and environmental historians. Were there extrinsic forces in earth, water, and sky that altered intrinsic elements of language, rhetoric, and imagery? Did material realities drive these changes, or social conditions, or ideological convictions, or hegemonic systems of meaning and value? Or did aesthetic and psychological representations evolve, mapping a new status for wetlands by replacing masculine priorities of stability, coherence, and power with feminized uncertainty, inconsistency, and fluidity? Is this a canonical issue, with wetlands emerging from centuries of neglect to shine forth as empowered? In all of these responses, we rarely hear the pragmatic voice of science: perhaps the physical condi tion of wetlands altered, and ideas then followed? Biological determin ism is unpopular with humanists because it raises the specter of systematic repression in the name of "natural law." Ironically, natural law was a product of medieval theology, and humanism once championed</page><page sequence="6">514 NEW LITERARY HISTORY science as a way to dispel dogma with the quantitative methods of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The current humanist disdain for science is based on partial or anachronistic knowledge, most clearly signaled by the relative indiffer ence toward Darwin, whose ideas still validate large portions of biologi cal science. Few humanists use Darwin as a theoretical base, even though his theory of evolution is a narrative that describes the dynamics of natural and sexual selection. Instead the hermeneutics of Marx and Freud have prevailed, and in their schemes nature is a brute or alien force. There is more and less to Darwin than humanists commonly think, and one project for ecocriticism is to reintroduce evolutionary theory to literary discourse.13 We also need to find ways to explain why literary places change in value over time. Many disciplinary fields examine places, from anthropology and folklore to linguistics, theology, and sociology. For my present purposes, the most useful models to consider are in literature, geography, and philosophy.14 Since the 1970s about two dozen literary studies of space and place have appeared, most of them influenced by Gaston Bachelard, whose The Poetics of Space offers a graceful, neo-Freudian reading of houses, rooms, and gardens as symbolic mirrors of the human psyche. Later critics sophisticated this approach and took it outdoors, in studies that view forest, desert, or mountain as forms of cultural poetics.15 In such readings, mental fabric is assumed to precede and fashion a natural context, much like the process of settling or building upon terrain. Yet terrain obviously plays a large role in defining where and what we may build. This causal riddle has dogged us since Descartes: do we think, and thus shape our world, or does the world fashion our thoughts? The dissonance between subject and object gave a tragic cast to American history, as Europeans moved into a continent they called "empty," despite the presence of several million native people. Such impositions of cultural power derive from what Paul Carter calls the epistemology of spatial history: people know a continent by small increments, as they spread across its face like an ever-widening stain.16 Geography began in antiquity, spawned most of the earth and social sciences, and today forms with ecology the core of modern environmen tal studies. Simply defined, geography surveys earth forms and processes that affect natural and cultural relations. The field has three well integrated branches: physical geography examines land, water, and energy resources; human geography studies their impact on history, culture, and society; regional geography analyzes political units created by those processes. Because their subject is physical, geographers use methods that are visual, spatial, and textual. They read the surface of the earth to interpret its arrangement and relations; they look for interac</page><page sequence="7">IMAGINED TERRITORY 515 tions that shape the environment in which all species live. Their principal descriptor is location, the placement or position of landscapes, species, cultures, and how they interact across space and time. Geogra phy (geographia, earth-drawing) has many affiliations with history and literature, for all are descriptive and inscriptive, using imagery and language to read and write earthly accounts.17 Some human geographers have embraced recent literary theory, agreeing with David Harvey that "geographical imagination is far too pervasive and important a fact of intellectual life to be left alone to geographers."18 Yet little reciprocity of interest is evident among literary academics, who mainly use place and space to verify notions of sign or power. Poststructural theory favors the ascendancy of reader over author or text, which to geographers is the equivalent of drawing maps in the dark. While "ground-truthing" is often required in science, empirical evidence is now commonly missing from humanistic inquiry. Ever since Foucault, research has become "a space into which the writing subject constantly disappears," to cite his famous dismissal of authorship. In Marxist and cultural studies, places are social productions or construc tions; while feminist, queer, and multicultural readings consistently describe place as interior or marginal, a space to reject, escape, or destroy.19 These built or imaginary locations, of undeniable import in literature, are rarely seen as affected by physical environment. The emphasis is on severing human conduct from natural or biological conditions, a view that generates stark solipsism in readings of locations. Gillian Tindall exemplifies this approach, by reading literary landscape as purely imaginative figments: My central concern is not with actual landscapes and dwellings, surviving or vanished, but with what these physical settings have become in the minds of novelists. I am concerned with the literary uses to which places are put, the meanings they are made to bear, the roles they play when they are re-created in fiction, the psychological journeys for which they are the destinations. Actual countries become countries of the mind, their topography transformed into psychological maps, private worlds. But, in the nature of novel writing, these worlds do not remain private but are transmitted back to readers, who then, in their turn, see the original locations with changed and awakened eyes.20 Her reasoning is that facts matter less than stories, that fantasy is superior to actuality, and that writing changes the meaning of place, invariably for the better. Shift the emphases a little, and we have the psychology of those who buy and sell real estate: what matters is not the land or house itself, but how much profit they bring as commodities. The process Tindall describes is not enhancement or improvement, a</page><page sequence="8">516 NEW LITERARY HISTORY word familiar to land developers; but alienation, a legal term that means to quit previous claims, and also suggests emotional or spiritual detach ment.21 We are clearly a long way from Emily Dickinson's conviction that nature knows more than it tells. Until critics learn to read the language of land in ways that involve recognition and integration, they will continue to alienate human culture toward its only planet.22 Yet even as literary critics ignored them, geographers were taking a fresh look at cultural renditions of physical space. A pioneer figure in this endeavor has been Yi-Fu Tuan, whose many writings have promoted his belief that geography offers a hermeneu tic for other disciplines. A political and intellectual refugee from 1948 China, Tuan wrote about his life to reveal how the division of places and people promotes anomie and migration, the hallmarks of postmodern alienation. He has pro posed replacing that estrangement with topophilia, an affection for places, which preserves their aesthetic value and sustains ethical behav ior toward the earth. His call for a sense of place that integrates feeling and thought establishes Tuan as a major interpreter of landscape in this century, one whose work provides measured political and ethical sup port for the natural and vernacular aesthetics of Jens Jensen and J. B. Jackson.23 Tuan's ideas have won support from human geographers who have worked on reading literary texts. Leonard Lutwack identifies two op posed themes that literature often expresses: that earth is a hostile, alien force, the enemy of human potential; and that it is the true home of humanity, one that best fulfills it. Both of these attitudes foreground religious convictions, which produce tensions between literal and sym bolic readings of place in many literary forms, from pastoral to tragic. A parallel effort by Anne Buttimer provides an experiential grounding of concepts like place and home by examining the uses of language and narrative in small-scale communities. Efforts like these use geography as textual interpretation, with a strong focus on both empirical and moral claims.24 Support for Tuan is also suggested by philosophers D. W. Winnicott and Richard Rorty. Winnicott worked on object relations theory, leading him to speculate about a zone between subject and object called "potential space," an area where play and aesthetics transpire. In his recasting of classical pragmatism, Rorty attacks the belief that knowledge is only mental or linguistic, arguing that literature must develop effective moral and political positions. He argues that the usual brand of realism is "an impossible attempt to view the world from Nowhere," because Somewhere always surrounds a subject, even if not well per ceived.25 This emphasis on context argues for finding a middle ground, between two opposites, so that subject-object or mind-place becomes a</page><page sequence="9">IMAGINED TERRITORY 517 synthesis of experience and imagination, a region lying amid apparent counterparts. Such a view directs the work of Nicholas Entrikin, whose "geography of modernity" affirms Between-ness as the condition of place, a concept echoed (if not cited) in recent studies of women writers, who are seen to occupy liminal or marginal spaces as a condition of their gender.26 These ideas from geography and philosophy suggest several ways for ecocritics to read textual places. By emphasizing mediation and dia logue, we may forego the isolating posture of alienation and learn why places like wetlands have evolved in meaning. But to build persuasive readings, and to validate the claim that places are significant in literary texts, ecocritics also need rigorous methods of analysis. Elsewhere I have urged them to use more interdisciplinary framing, with theoretical models drawn from ecology and planning.27 Those disciplines account for change in places through a sequence called the land-use cycle. All inhabited land follows a cycle of change from natural to social condi tions. Geographic location (latitude, longitude, and elevation) deter mines the sites of habitats: tundra, forest, wetland. Rain, sun, and wind erode rock into soil, which sustains plants, and they draw animals?since all life forms follow food trails. The succession of human occupants mark phases of land tenure, secured by technology and hierarchy. If people leave, the cycle reverses; if they stay, choices must follow: neglect the land and risk its permanent damage, or restore and protect it against further losses. In the latter choice, a change in cultural values occurs? as humans learn to respect what nature knows.28 The cycle tells a story, implying author and audience, and the ecocritical task is to apply this narrative to literary discourse. The prevalence in nature of repeating cycles?like geological erosion, depo sition, and uplift?have their equivalents in biological life, death, and recomposition. A sequence of energy consumption?as species use, deplete, or sustain resources?echoes the course of cultural transmis sion, as people acquire thoughts, give them designs, and share the results. Authors who describe these patterns are writing narratives about the geography and ecology of power. To test this theory, we might look to many imagined terrains, from Austen's Hampshire to Hardy's Wessex, but in America, a prime candidate is William Faulkner, the inventor and "sole proprietor" of a land he called Yoknapatawpha County. Faulkner wrote fourteen novels set in Yoknapatawpha, a close ana logue for Lafayette County, his home in northern Mississippi. Readers often insist that Faulkner is a "universal" writer, soaring above the narrow confines of regional space and custom. This view originated with Malcolm Cowley, a veteran New Yorker, who decreed that Yoknapatawpha embodies an epic myth of Euro-American history. Later critics often</page><page sequence="10">518 NEW LITERARY HISTORY divide on whether Yoknapatawpha is literal or figurai, forgetting that it should be both, to suggest mythic dimensions.29 In Go Down, Moses, seven Yoknapatawpha tales portray the dispossession of Indians, the enslavement of Africans, the rebellion and destruction of Civil War, and the impoverished years of Reconstruction. The stories repeat episodes of conquest?territorial, racial, and sexual?presented as obsessive quests for gold, power, and expiation of sin. The main rite of purification transpires in "The Bear," which tells how young Ike McCaslin finds deliverance in the Big Woods, a place described as "profound, sentient, gigantic, and brooding."30 Faulkner's characters call the Big Woods "wilderness," but in geo graphical terms it is a middle landscape, lying between lowland plains and upland Appalachians. Owned by Ike's family and now his principal legacy, Big Woods stand on piedmont, a rising country of mixed forest, conifer and deciduous, that sustains a great variety of plant and animal life?and nourishes an omnivore like Old Ben, a large, elusive bear who is a legendary quarry. This piece of property is "wilderness" to men of the McCaslin clan because it represents a desire for higher ground, where they may transcend the lowland realm of farms and villages. Their annual hunts are efforts to reclaim a lost code of blood and sacrifice, thought to have ruled in prehistoric time. The hunters bring food for early meals, then forage off the land. They try to preserve racial and class privileges, but in this realm, other orders prevail. On Ike's fourth hunt, he is sixteen and begins to learn about dispossession?through a rite of passage that begins in wedands. The story does not follow a direct chronology but slips back and forth, and as a hunter, Ike must also learn an asynchronous logic. He gives up his rifle, watch, and compass to follow tracks, wandering far from known terrain. When lost, he begins to walk a sweeping half circle, looking for a back-track. He turns in one direction and then its opposite, coming at last to a transitional zone: and this time it was not even the tree because there was a down log beside it which he had never seen before and beyond the log a little swamp, a seepage of moisture somewhere between earth and water, and he did what Sam had coached and drilled him as the next and the last, seeing as he sat down on the log the crooked print, the warped indentation in the wet ground which while he looked at it continued to fill with water until it was level full and the water began to overflow and the sides of the print began to dissolve away. Even as he looked up he saw the next one, and, moving, the one beyond it; moving, not hurrying, running, but merely keeping pace with them as they appeared before him as though they were being shaped out of thin air just one constant pace short of where he would lose them forever and be lost forever himself, tireless, eager, without doubt or dread, panting a little above the</page><page sequence="11">IMAGINED TERRITORY 519 strong rapid little hammer of his heart, emerging suddenly into a litt?e glade, and the wilderness coalesced. It rushed, soundless, and solidified?the tree, the bush, the compass and the watch glinting where a ray of sunlight touched them. Then he saw the bear. (243-45, emphasis mine) The passage moves Ike from swamp to glade, wedand to woodland, and that change of locus transforms his identity. Lost in the woods, he finds a new track, sets aside old lessons, sees familiar terrain grow strange, keeps pace with an invisible (but also silent, knowing) quarry. The journey is a paradox, every advancing step regressing Ike from present confusion toward an ordered past, before human claims turned wilder ness into land. The font of this revelation is a swamp, "somewhere between earth and water," where those twinned elements yield the sign of a paw print: a trace on soil now in the process of filling with water, it is space marking time, a presence telling of recent absence. Following the swamp trail to where he feels "lost forever," Ike reaches a glade, the starting point where he left compass and watch. By tracing this circuit of pursuit, he is in the right place to see the bear step out of fable and into a living moment, "and the wilderness coalesced." This transforming moment cannot return the wilderness to its origi nal and unitary condition, buj: it helps Ike see that the human claim of possession is illusory. Like that paw print, he is between earth and water, filling up and going empty, moving toward a destiny where past and future, boy and man, bear and woods, all coalesce in a single, blazing rush: wilderness. The experience is about mystical fusion, the loss of boundaries, and also about social maturation, gaining a sense of place. In later parts of "The Bear," Ike relinquishes his claim on the Big Woods to atone for its founding in racial and sexual crimes. For him, that ethic rises from the geographic identity of a place he found and lost. The tale strongly invokes geography because tracking and hunting, like surveying and mapping, are acts that put mind to land, trace nature's contours to learn what it knows. That notion of wilderness is at odds with a view advanced by Nina Baym, that "The essential quality of America" rests in "unsetded wilder ness" and the opportunities it offers "the individual as a medium on which he may inscribe, unhindered, his own destiny and his own nature." Baym argues that inscribing is equivalent to owning and settling land; but Ike McCaslin is describing his destiny by relinquishing a claim on land, yielding to the unwritten priority of wilderness. (His cash legacy turns into worthless IOUs.) Faulkner is writing an eco-fable about the folly of possession, and his skeptical view of property has a long ancestry. As several scholars have noted, the settlement of America was fraught with nostalgic regret, as newcomers often sensed they had destroyed the</page><page sequence="12">520 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Eden they had sought. Taking land was not a male obsession, since women participated in settiement, just as both genders later crowded their lives with domestic commodities. Ike's tale carries us toward a mediated view: the wilderness will coalesce when we lose old stories and read a new place, somewhere between earth and water.31 III. The Mud of the Mire I have focused on wedands because for thousands of years they have represented wilderness, and thus help us to trace evolving readings of its status. The desert or forest might also qualify, but wedands have experienced a more evident change in signification. To recent scientists, wetlands exemplify natural biodiversity and offer a testing ground for ecocritical practice. Most biomes correspond to climate zones: jungles in the tropics, tundra in the arctic. Wetlands are a global habitat, occurring at all latitudes and elevations, from seaboard plains to alpine ranges. Depending on location, they may have fresh, salt, or brackish water and produce high or low biotic yields. They also come in a wide variety of shapes, are seen as wild and unpredictable, yet in that diversity sustain the integrity of living systems. Described metaphorically by William Neiring as "the kidneys of the landscape," wedands perform rites of cleansing: they transfer, settle, filter, and recharge the mingled elements of soil and water.32 We cannot essentialize wedands, because they are hybrid and multivalent: neither land nor water alone, they are water land; a continuum between terra and aqua. In rhetorical terms they are not syntax but parataxis, phrases placed side by side, without apparent connection, a term Joseph Frank used to describe spatial forms that evoke a great variety of response. In their wildness, wedands dispossess readers of old codes and lead toward new syntax, where phrases may begin to reassemble.33 Among literary scholars, Peter Fritzell was the first to explore the cultural implications of this environment from an ecocritical perspec tive. In a journal that rarely publishes English professors, he wrote, "Wetlands are not conventional wild areas. They do not cater to established, classical concepts of vista, horizon, and landscape. By comparison with the Smokies or the High Sierra, wetlands are claustro phobic. They force you inward, both upon yourself and upon the nonhuman world. They do not give you grand views; they humble you rather than reinforce your delusions of grandeur. ... A wetiand is nothing if not a patient environment. It reminds you more of slow, ongoing processes of change than it does of the pinnacles of evolution ary achievement."34 This ethical reading calls on humility and patience</page><page sequence="13">IMAGINED TERRITORY 521 to master feelings of alienation from wilderness. A more dispassionate reader might counsel stronger action, either separation or divorce. Humans are oxic creatures, requiring oxygen-rich air, while wetlands are anoxic or noxious, producing marsh gas (methane) that has the sulfuric, fecal smell of rotted eggs. A wetiand is not just alien to human life; it provides litde basis for a life beyond subsistence. One may hunt or forage there, but a wetland is not solid enough to allow farming or building, the ground of civilization. Ecologists call unstable regions of this sort ecotones because they contain no fixed boundaries, only a gradient slope between solid and fluid. Two terms for wetlands, swamp and marsh, are not synonyms but distinctions: a swamp has woody plants, while a marsh is mostly grasses. Swamps tend to be inland; marshes lie on coast and shore lines. Yet whether called swamp, flat, marsh, or bog, these areas have come by long association to express divided values: (1) difficulty or uncertainty, as in a quagmire, or morass; (2) change, since wetlands are transition zones, between water and land; and (3) contingency or possibility, because wetlands may foster new life. If they do not remind Fritzell of "pinnacles of evolutionary achievement," wetlands still play a vital role in ecosystem dynamics. Moving slowly through wetlands, water settles decaying organ isms to create fertile bottoms, while sending a nutrient-rich effluent downstream, to nourish surface areas. Left undisturbed, wetlands trans form muck into peat, methane, or coal, thus becoming useful to extractive industry. They form a constellation of paradoxes: although wild and thus defining human limits, wetlands are a global ecosystem that feed about half the world's creatures, cover six percent of its land surface, and exist everywhere but Antarctica.35 We may now begin to see why authors over time express such varying responses to wetlands: yes, ideas change, but so do places, and an ecocritic should chart their reciprocity as the changes transpire. Throughout history wetlands have altered in value, at first because they impeded humanity, and now because humanity is engulfing them. As a remnant of fast-receding wildness, wetlands are the landscape equivalent of extinct or endangered species, from dinosaurs and pandas to indigenous tribes. They are an anodyne for the discontents of civilization, following an inverse law of supply and demand. As they passed from original abun dance to present scarcity, their meaning evolved. Somewhere along the course of history, an old reading or syntax gave way to paratactic phase, followed by a new reading that is still emerging. The transitions frame what Tuan calls a hearth or home, places where wetlands coalesced, like Ike's wilderness, in moments of cultural revelation.36 Antagonism toward wetlands governed most ancient civilizations, going back to the eastern Mediterranean, where arable land was scarce</page><page sequence="14">522 NEW LITERARY HISTORY and precious. Early creation myths tend to form land out of water, describing the latter as a realm of demonic chaos. In Genesis 1, the world is at first a shapeless void of waters until God moves upon their face, dividing light from dark, and then waters from waters, so that dry land may appear. The great Divider thus sets a course for generations of farmers: wherever men find low, water-saturated ground, they must drain and dry it, freeing themselves from "the mud of the mire" (Ps. 40) so that plows and seeds may follow. By controlling cultivation and reproduction, men are granted dominion over earthly life (Gen. 1:28). In this old reading of wetlands, drainage is a patriarchal duty that cleanses and fertilizes the earth; it sanctions controlling land, subduing women, and training children for future security.37 In the year 1500, wedands covered one-third of the North American continent, stretching along both seaboards and beside most inland waters. Early explorers described these places as hazardous, a barrier to navigation and the source of pestilential diseases. Their fears measured the ominous nature of unknown, untamed land. As Columbus traversed the coastal marshes of Cuba, and DeSoto led a forced march across the Everglades, both sought gold and found instead swampy, malaria infested realms, unfit for all save the Arawak natives, who appeared to thrive in tropical mire. When storms blew the English Pilgrims off their course for Virginia and landed them on Cape Cod, they were dismayed to find beyond its beaches only dense marshes and boggy thickets of scrub cedar: a "howling, desolate wilderness" William Bradford recalled, where piety and practicality would be much tested. On earth their salvation lay with the Massachuset people, who revealed that the marshes held an abundance of edible plants and wild game. The old reading of wedands began to falter, as settlers turned from ideology to direct experience. Unfortunately for the Massachuset, tales of New England plenitude attracted masses of trans-Adantic immigrants through out the seventeenth century.38 As Europeans possessed the New World, Stephen Greenblatt writes, they also grasped its marvelous, magical possibilities. The story of America's colonial years may also be told as eco-disaster, destroying wetiand habitats to build good ports and farms. William Cronon describes the fencing and draining of New England fields, ostensibly to foil wolves, as a catastrophe that erased many forms of wildlife, as well as native populations. Many of the English setders hailed from East Anglia, a vast fenland drained to create fields and canals, dotted with windmills. As Christian farmers, they heeded a favorite allegory, Pilgrims Progress, wherein the hero finds his path to grace blocked by a foul mudhole. He asks a figure named Help why the place is not drained: "And he said unto me, This miry slough is such a place as cannot be mended; it is the</page><page sequence="15">IMAGINED TERRITORY 523 descent whither the scum and filth that attends conviction for sin doth continually run, and therefore it is called the Slough of Despond; for still, as the sinner is awakened about his lost condition, there ariseth in his soul many fears, and doubts, and discouraging apprehensions, which all of them get together, and sett?e in this place." Help says that no amount of dumping, whether cart-loads of soil or wholesome instruc tions, will "make good ground of the place," for it is made of despon dency, the loss of faith that makes life wretched. As a figure of all things fallen, the Slough sends a clear homily to New World settlers: be of good faith, and drain thy fields.39 The drive for human dominion was not solely Christian, for drainage was practiced from Asia and the Fertile Crescent to the dikes of Holland. But in America, physical geography played an obvious hand in shaping wetland change. From Boston to Savannah, most coastal cities arose at fall lines, places where sand met rock and blocked easy upstream travel. Dams at those sites impounded water power for mills, and the millraces also drained wetlands. According to ecologist John Terborgh, diverting such water sources permanently destroys boundary ecosystems. Colonials read swampland as unattained capital, an outward sign of social decay. On his journey in 1729 to survey a line dividing Virginia and North Carolina, William Byrd wrote that wherever the land was "a miry pocosin," its farmers were slovenly and indolent, inclined to loaf and beget mulatto slaves.40 In its post-Revolutionary years, America defined itself as an agrarian republic, all progress marked by civic improvement. The federal capitol stood in a new District of Columbia, centered between North and South, on land recovered from marshes. Spokesmen for republican virtues embraced Enlightenment precepts, using rational and liberal means to justify social progress. In Letters from an American Farmer, Hector St. John de Cr?vecoeur charts the course of a civil people: "To examine how the world is gradually setded, how the howling swamp is converted into a pleasing meadow, the rough ridge into a fine field; and to hear the cheerful whistling, the rural song, where there was no sound heard before, save the yell of the savage, the screech of the owl or the hissing of the snake?" Such pastoral imagery elevated American cultural status above the reach of European jibes. Arranging his Notes on the State of Virginia into tidy essays on natural and social features, Thomas Jefferson disputes the French naturalist Georges Buffon, who said New World species were puny because they lived on a swampy continent. Jefferson denies the animals are smaller, but also asserts that swamps have little effect on species size. He also praises the practice of draining marshes to create meadows, and the unexpected cultural benefit of exposing ancient Indian mounds, like those he excavated at Rivanna, Virginia.</page><page sequence="16">524 NEW LITERARY HISTORY When he later sent Lewis and Clark to find a continental route to the Pacific, Jefferson encouraged his deputies to survey river wetlands for their natural history data.41 Spurred by the work of Linnaeus, whose Systema Naturae (1734) categorized species into hierarchical order, emerging natural sciences began to alter the reading of wetlands, by identifying them as homes to rare and diverse species. A literary expression of this changing view came from Quaker naturalist William Bartram, whose Travels through the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida describes an unspoiled world of coastal river swamps and vigorous native tribes. Traveling on "a sylvan pilgrimage" in the Revolutionary years, Bartram happily wanders from cavernous sinkholes to alligator swamps, accepting all that he finds as emanating from the divine force of Nature: "What a beautiful retreat is here! Blessed unviolated spot of earth, rising from the limpid waters of the lake: its fragrant groves and blooming lawns invested and protected by encircling ranks of the Yucca gloriosa"*2 By painting and describing a large number of new plants and animals, along with the intricate customs of the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw nations, Bartram pro jected new ways to read wedands, and his inquiring romantic spirit began to publicize the cultural value of wilderness. Even so, the early 1800s were a time of frantic national growth, when wetlands vanished at a stunning rate. By mid-century over half of the original one hundred and fifty million acres were lost, mainly to increased farming. Jefferson's agrarian rhetoric held that farmers were the nation's "natural aristocrats," acquiring a sanctity from lives spent close to soil. When European immigrant populations surged, Congress negated its Indian treaties and opened western lands to settlement. Homesteaders advanced to the Alleghenies, then across the prairies to the Mississippi River. Observing in 1808 the success of squatters in clearing river bottom-land, John James Audubon wrote: "Time will no doubt be, when the great valley of the Mississippi, still covered with primeval forests, interspersed with swamps, will smile with corn-fields and orchards, while crowded cities will rise at intervals along its banks, and enlightened nations will rejoice in the bounties of Providence."43 The rise of cities began to alter the reading of countryside. Audubon praised a cultivated landscape "interspersed with swamps" because his bird paintings sold well to urban buyers, eager to see native American wildlife. But many authors still read wetlands as unmade, slovenly aspects of rural life. The hero of Washington Irving's tale, "Rip Van Winkle" seems to acquire his character from unimproved land: "The great error in Rip's composition was an insuperable aversion to all kinds of profitable labor. It could not be from the want of assiduity or perseverance. . . . He would carry a fowling-piece on his shoulder for</page><page sequence="17">IMAGINED TERRITORY 525 hours together, trudging through woods and swamps, and up hill and down dale, to shoot a few squirrels or wild pigeons." Swamps were also known to breed mosquitoes, a dangerous source of infection. Edgar Allan Poe's story, "The Sphinx," recounts the horror of plague and miasma, always emanating from rural bogs. Some urban landscaping projects, Central Park in New York and Boston's Back Bay, featured well tamed streams or ponds lined with marsh grasses, nostalgic allusions to a lost ecology. National rural policy remained firmly anti-wetland, when in 1860 Congress began to pass a series of Swamp Land Acts that ceded to the states sixty-five million acres for reclamation, draining fields for more "productive" uses.44 Yet as wealth promoted leisure and travel for urban dwellers, popular art began to generate ever more appealing images of wetlands. Margaret Welch notes that mass-market books by Audubon, Nuttal, and Gray encouraged nature study, mainly in woods and wetlands. Longfellow's narrative poem, Evangeline, a Tale ofAcadie, tells the idyllic story of lovers separated in Acadia and reunited in the bayous of Louisiana. In Rhode Island, Martin Johnson Heade painted over one hundred scenes of salt marsh haystacks, emphasizing the play of light upon smooth, flattened shapes of land and water. As technology diminished the old agrarian society, wetlands came to be read as what Leo Marx calls a garden, a region of beauty and fertility lying between wild and settled terrain.45 IV. In Praise of Swamps By the mid-nineteenth century, shifting attitudes changed wetlands from economic liability into cultural asset. Writers began to read places not as reflected power or virtue, but as states of emotion and perception. Americans read offen and moor, of salt marshes and tidal flats, in the poems of Wordsworth and Keats or the novels of Dickens, the Brontes, and Hardy, and waterlands became a primary landscape of cultural imagination. Romantic esteem for joining the real and ideal, Garry Wills notes, gave fresh emphasis to images of liminal space, land or water that has a loose and flowing horizon. The shifting, evanescent boundaries of wetlands naturally suggested relations be tween actual and imagined, surface and depth. Melville writes early in Moby-Dick, "There is a magic in water," and that magic lies in liquids, which reflect and bend light while slipping between motion and stasis. Moby-Dick abounds with such fluidity, using alliterative, metrical ca dences and images of land to invoke a marine world: "As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these monsters</page><page sequence="18">526 NEW LITERARY HISTORY swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea." The rhetorical figure that conveys liminality is metaphor, which Melville uses to name a thing with another's name, transferring identity by suggesting resem blance. As we have seen with Emily Dickinson, metaphor reads a known to signify an unknown; through connections and coincidences it suggests correspondence. Metaphor also alters the meanings of words, undermining their stability until land and sea intertwine. The duality and duplicity of Melville's reading rests with its aim to perceive similarity in dissimilars.46 In the era when America was so profoundly divided over slavery, it was inevitable to read wetlands as evidence of cultural and political schism. John Wilmerding's exhibition catalog, The Waters of America (1984), equates lake and river fluidity with Yankee imagination, while David Miller concludes that wetlands absorb the sectional tensions of the Civil War. In Miller's view, Southern authors saw swamps as sanctuaries from an urbanized, technological world; while Northern writers regarded them as experimental places to test new ideas about nature and culture. Through such clashes, wedands acquired paratactic qualities, no longer read strictly for their economic value. The writer who most advanced a new reading was Henry David Thoreau, whose quiet life in Concord, Massachusetts once seemed safely obscure, but today is seen as the nucleus of a "green" tradition in American writing. We can better understand that change of stature by examining his view of swamps.47 During the spring of 1858, Thoreau's daily excursions into Concord led him often to Beck Stow's Swamp, lying in the northeast corner of the twenty-six square-mile township. For six weeks Thoreau studied the swamp, because a spell of warm, wet weather had produced "a remark able spring for reptile life." Over those days he observed, and recorded at length in his journal, the entire reproductive cycle of frogs, from earliest mating to hatching. He was keen to trace the course of amphibian metamorphosis, a slow, barely discernible succession of changes that altered quick-darting tadpoles into massive adults, sitting still and Buddha-like in the damp heat. Thoreau emulated their patience by standing motionless for hours, until one day Beck Stow happened by. For ten minutes Mr. Stow watched the unmoving Thoreau, and then called out, "Father, is that you?" Upon a closer view Stow apologized, explaining that his parent often drank rum at a local tavern, and then lost his way home.48 As told in ajournai entry, the story jokes about sobriety, contrasting one man's stimulant to another's, but it also makes telling distinctions about land-use. Stow may think his swamp unfit for harvest, but Thoreau reads it a seat of learning, the more so because it yields no material</page><page sequence="19">IMAGINED TERRITORY 527 profit. Often his writings praise swamps, to celebrate land that others avoid or think useless. The story of his first trip to Maine, "Ktaadn," tells of sloshing along wet forest trails and visiting loggers in homes made of bark "and redolent of swampy odors, with that sort of vigor and perennialness even about them that toadstools suggest." In Waiden Thoreau builds a logger's home beside a glacial pond and visits swamps in the nearby woods. To him a swamp is a "savage" place, where the hidden beauty of flowering pinks and leafing black birches reveal themselves slowly to a visitor: "If there were druids whose temples were the oak groves, my temple is the swamp." Like Dickinson, he reads the inhuman swamp as a natural companion: remote and secluded, anoma lous yet orderly. The swamps are cool in summer and warm in winter, as rising artesian waters keep mosses green and berries ripe for feeding partridges. Swamps are also home to owls, whose ghostly calls suggest "a vast and undeveloped nature which men have not recognized. They represent the stark twilight and unsatisfied thoughts which all have."49 Thoreau's interest in "undeveloped nature" stemmed from a lifelong fascination with wilderness, the domain that he saw as sustaining cultural vitality. During his career he wrote about New England lakes, forests, and mountains not just to convey immediacy, but to present ideas about how land changes human lives. Certainty of physical transformation, and the possibility of metaphysical transcendence, drive his narrative plots, which he extracted from a dailyjournal that recorded many years of landscape study. The similarity of this writing process to scientific experiment (observe, n?tate, analyze, write, revise) was not accidental, for he was a land surveyor, and his journal entries continu ously mapped the land, seasons, and ideas he encountered. In the spring of 1858 he was studying metamorphosis, wanting to know its exact sequence, testing and correcting inferences when wrong. Within a year he was reading Charles Darwin's Origin of Species and writing in the journal about evolution, "the development theory." Determined to test its implications, Thoreau spent two years extracting from his journal some final works: a paper on forest succession, "The Succession of Forest Trees"; two accounts of seasonal change, "Autum nal Tints" and "Wild Apples"; an essay on wilderness and history, "Walking, or the Wild"; and two long manuscripts, "Wild Fruits" and "The Dispersion of Seeds," left unfinished when he died on May 6,1862. These writings promoted evolutionary views of natural history, while urging upon Americans a new reading of undeveloped lands.50 In "Walking" Thoreau writes that "Wildness is the preservation of the world" and that America was discovered to keep the Wild alive. This radical turn away from the Puritan and Enlightenment story of wilder ness locates itself in a living earth, not dead traditions, and Thoreau's</page><page sequence="20">528 NEW LITERARY HISTORY new text is the swamp, because it represents "hope and the future," a place for true subsistence as opposed to cultivated gardens. Although largely unrecognized for its worth, the swamp still works a restorative power: When I would recreate myself, I seek the darkest woods, the thickest and most interminable and, to the citizen, most dismal, swamp. I enter a swamp as a sacred place,?a sanctum sanctorum. There is the strength, the marrow, of Nature. The wildwood covers the virgin mould,?and the same soil is good for men and for trees. A man's health requires as many acres of meadow to his prospect as his farm does loads of muck. There are the strong meats on which he feeds. A town is saved, not more by the righteous men in it than by the woods and swamps that surround it.51 The preservation of wildness defines it not for profit or leisure, but for recreation, a word Thoreau stretches to mean spiritual health, re-creation. He also implies bodily health, with references to marrow, mould, muck, and meats all signifying metabolic process. Far from seeing the Wild as a dark enemy of civilization, Thoreau reads it as a model for dynamic change, full of intricate, seething relations between species, habitats, and natural events. His view anticipates the findings of modern ecology; that nature is interactive, self-regulating, and biologically diverse. As Dana Phillips notes, ecology does not read these processes as static or "balanced," but unstable and mutable. Recognizing that byproduct of biodiversity, Thoreau urged farmers in "The Succession of Forest Trees" to manage their land by sustaining many habitats rather than creating one-crop fields, which erode a soil's health. He did not live to write an extended narrative on development, except in his unpublished journal. That task fell to Darwin himself, as he composed a book on the necessity of natural change.52 V. An Entangled Bank Darwin's "development theory" came from three sources: discoveries in the earth sciences that verified deep prehistoric time; field research on his Beagle voyage, confirming that species change form; and walks on the hills near his home in Kent. During the 1850s, while Thoreau stalked Concord for his journal, Darwin daily traced his "thinking path" and pondered the sequence of species transmutation. In "Walking" Thoreau wrote that the outline of a walk "would be, not a circle, but a parabola, or rather like one of those cometary orbits which have been thought to be on non-returning curves" (W 607). Darwin gave a similar plot to his</page><page sequence="21">IMAGINED TERRITORY 529 theory. In the fourth chapter of Origin of Species he writes that develop ment has three stages: heredity, what parents give offspring; mutation, the variations that offspring sustain; and selection, the survival adaptations they pass to descendants. The stages bear a strong resemblance to Melville's image, in "The Mat-Maker" chapter of Moby-Dick, of time as a mat woven by chance, free will, and destiny. Darwin's theory connected past, present, and future in a repeating cycle that advanced along a line. He called this chapter "Survival of the Fittest," a phrase widely misunder stood by later readers. The "fittest" species were not the strongest, but those who fit best, made the most lasting adaptations. His concluding image of nature is "an entangled bank" of linked and opposing forces, locked in competitive struggle but also laced with web-like relations. The sources of these images, which foretell ecosystem ecology, lay along his thinking path, which may explain why he read the past as a stately Victorian narrative, ever launched in a progressive direction. Later evolutionists agree that he was right about the sequence of change, but too confident it would always be improving.53 For the opposite case one could look to America, where a Gilded Age boom was sacking the continent with industrial speed. Barely settled to the Mississippi in 1860, the nation built a cross-country railway system and grew so rapidly that by 1900 it had drained swamps, cleared forests, and plowed grasslands from Boston to Denver. This cultural triumphalism won endorsement from historian Frederick Jackson Turner, who argued in 1893 that the settlement of frontier lands shaped early American values of independence, self-reliance, and innovation. His claim has drawn defenders and attackers, the latter noting that pioneers also eroded land, slaughtered bison, and pushed Indians into a fatal war of attrition.54 In a saga Garrett Hardin calls "the tragedy of the commons," public resources surrendered to private greed. The urban North pros pered by drawing raw materials from its poor regional cousins: grain and beef from the western Plains, timber and coal from the southern Appalachians. During its era of so-called Reconstruction, the South remained economically stagnant, and writers read that decline in their wedands. Describing the unchanged "Marshes of Glyn" near his coastal Georgia home, Sidney Lanier broods on wartime devastation and the need to find new modes of rebuilding. In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain ponders the meaning of river currents that give or take land arbitrarily, flushing it from north to south and building "the Body of the Nation," despite all the changes that scarred its regions.55 Darwinian theory also failed to explain changes in the status of women, as stories by or about them acclaimed social progress yet found liberty to be an enigmatic morass. In her antislavery novel, Dred, Harriet Beecher Stowe sends a black fugitive into the Great Dismal Swamp,</page><page sequence="22">530 NEW LITERARY HISTORY there to become a free man, but also a violent killer. The heroine of Henry James's Daisy Miller defies convention with a night visit to the Roman forum, only to contract malaria from swamp air. Sara Orne Jewett's stories of Maine, gathered in A Marsh Island and The Country of the Pointed Firs, associate wedands with female courage: an old "yarb woman" gathers medicinal herbs from swamps; in the marshes, a girl saves her beloved white heron from a plume hunter. The revisionist slant of these stories sacrificed nature to allegory. Jewett's heroine is a savior, but it is a stubborn fact that white herons never nest in Maine.56 The earliest attempt to read natural and cultural conflict on evolu tionary terms came from George Perkins Marsh, a Vermont farmer who wrote books on language, practiced law, and traveled widely on foreign service missions. His recognition of the adverse effect of land clearance and overgrazing led to pioneering studies of conservation, Man and Nature and The Earth as Modified by Human Action. In the former work, he charts many cycles of human disturbance, such as the fur trade, which destroyed beavers and their watersheds. Marsh urged halting this destruction and becoming "a co-worker with nature" by planting slopes, flooding marshes, and directing streams to reservoirs. His aim was not to return nature to its "primitive narrow channels," but to correct the damage already done, while maintaining extractive industries. These warnings helped create the United States Forestry Commission, inspired the conservation efforts of John Muir and John Burroughs, and directed many private and public actions to protect wilderness areas well into the 1920s.57 Conservation offered a narrative account of Darwinian change, but it told a conservative, centrist story by seeking to protect both nature and commerce. This same era saw passage of the 1902 Reclamation Act, hailed by Theodore Roosevelt because it sold public lands "for the purpose of reclaiming the waste areas of the arid West by irrigating lands otherwise worthless, and thus creating new homes upon the land." Conservation upheld the old colonial-republican reading of wedands and made it a national template, sanctioning the destruction of a vast but fragile Western savanna. Many conservationists today still cling to the frontier hypothesis that foregrounds human sensibility, the "sense of place" or "spirit of place" they often cite in titles. As co-founder of the Wilderness Society, Wallace Stegner exemplifies that dogma: "I know no way to look at the world, settled or wild, except through my own human eyes." Conservation-minded writers tend to advance a "stewardship" or "sustainable development" model of environmental protection, as does Frederick Turner, who says writers "take imaginative possession of the land" to counteract harmful systems of land-tenure. The tendency is to cast literature as didactic, a well-intended view that over-privileges</page><page sequence="23">IMAGINED TERRITORY 531 writing: books make places "special, if not sacred, because they have been the inspiration of literature."58 A new and quite different narrative sustained Darwin, and also Thoreau's call for preservation, with the principles of ecology, a term coined by Ernst Haeckel in 1869. An ardent Darwinist and socialist, Haeckel redefined the "entangled bank" of nature as a complex set of inter-relations, not always progressive or beneficial to humans, that created patterns of exchange and flow between ecosystems. According to Joel B. Hagen, as ecosystem ecology developed over the next century, it became a means of narrating the abuses of land-use history and arguing for strict preservation of such wilderness habitats as wetlands, which ecologists valued as living demonstrations of theoretical meta phors like community, network, and system.59 Two writers at mid-twentieth-century, Aldo Leopold and Rachel Carson, invoked ecological principles to dramatize responsible wetlands policy. Both were public servants but wrote books as acts of personal testament. In A Sand County Almanac, Leopold describes his evolution from a federal conservation ranger, paid to kill wolves, to a preservationist who designs a moral scheme for environmental protection called "the land ethic." Leopold chose to make his case through brief nature essays, styled as segments of a seasonal almanac. In "Marshland Elegy" he describes a passing day, dawn to dusk, that portrays how a wetiand evolves into habitat for nesting cranes: "A sense of time lies thick and heavy on such a place. Yearly since the ice age it has awakened each spring to the clangor of cranes. The peat layers that comprise the bog are laid down in the basin of an ancient lake. The cranes stand, as it were, upon the sodden pages of their own history. . . . An endless caravan of generations has built of its own bones this bridge into the future, this habitat where the oncoming host again may live and breed and die. To what end?" With a trace of self consciousness (as it were), this rhetoric replaces conservationist prudence with a preservationist call to dispossess. Marsh cranes are ancient and inscriptive beings, writing "the sodden pages" of their past, laying down their bones to feed the peat and keep their progeny coming on. Nature ceaselessly moves through change, and humans should preserve that process, not disturb it with farming or hunting. The core of Leopold's land ethic is to extend to nature the same rights and privileges that people enjoy: "We abuse the land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect."60 In Silent Spring, Rachel Carson intensifies that sense of community by analyzing the destructive force of chemical pesticides. In an incisive passage, she demonstrates how toxicity spreads through ground water, a system of transport so invisible that it is easy to ignore:</page><page sequence="24">532 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Seldom if ever does Nature operate in closed and separate compartments, and she has not done so in distributing the earth's water supply. Rain, falling on the land, settles down through pores and cracks in soil and rock, penetrating deeper and deeper until eventually it reaches a zone where all the pores of the rock are filled with water, a dark subsurface sea, rising under hills, sinking under valleys. This groundwater is always on the move, sometimes at a pace so slow that it travels no more than 50 feet a year, sometimes rapidly, by comparison, so that it moves nearly a tenth of a mile a day. It travels by unseen waterways until here and there it comes to the surface as a spring, or perhaps it is tapped as a well. But mostly it contributes to streams and so to rivers. Except for what enters streams directly as rain or surface runoff, all the running water of the earth's surface was at one time groundwater. And so, in a very real and frightening sense, pollution of the groundwater is pollution of water everywhere. Carson adds a feminist perspective to the evolutionary logic of preserva tionist discourse. Her Nature is clearly female: open and connected, she possesses both evident features and a hidden zone where water lives, "a dark subsurface sea, rising under hills, sinking beneath valleys" and constantly moves, nourishing all land and thus in equal danger of poisoning it. Her emphasis on a horizontal zone that receives and sustains the vertical is clearly sexual, the generative absorbing the seminal, like earth swallowing seed; yet Carson stresses not differences but entirety, the wholeness of a system that consists of parts, any of which may bring health or disease to all. Ecology informs her ethics through the figure of ground-water, an inverse variant of wet-land. For her efforts, Carson was attacked by the petrochemical industry as hysterical and unscientific. But her logic and eloquence impressed the Kennedy administration, brought a ban on DDT and other pesticides, and eventually helped create the Environmental Protection Agency.61 Preservationist narrative argues for the intrinsic quality of places, as they represent ideals of beauty, sanctity, and justice. These values have made the once neglected and derided wetlands into an icon of natural health and a model for social order. In the words of Paul Errington, "Greater familiarity with marshes . . . could give man a truer and more wholesome view of himself in relation to Nature." Knowledge of wetiand ecology has advanced, and so has protective legislation, while on the cultural side, a new generation of writers now champion wetlands preservation. Some are scientists, like Edward O. Wilson, who writes about the marshes and swamps of Georgia and Florida, where he learned the principles of biodiversity and biogeography. Others are reporters and essayists like Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiesson, and Bill McKibben, who consistently portray American wetlands as centers of ecological harmony and rallying points for environmental action.62</page><page sequence="25">IMAGINED TERRITORY 533 Yet stories have no effect if they fail to reach understanding readers. Since declaring independence in 1776, Americans have destroyed over two-thirds of their continental wetlands. The current rate of loss is estimated at eight hundred acres a day (six hundred football fields), nearly all of it for tract houses or shopping malls. The surviving area is about fifty million acres, and if nothing is done, it will vanish by the year 2050.63 If Americans lost compact discs or videos at that rate, they would regard their preservation as the moral equivalent of war. If present trends continue, one day we will share only an inventory of lost wetlands, an elegy to American wilderness: the Hackensack Meadows and Tinicum Marsh, Currituck Sound and the Wet Kankakee Prairie, Indiana's Limberlost and the Black Swamp of Ohio; Horicon Marsh; the Playa Lakes of the Texas Panhandle. Noting our long tendency to see wedands doubly, the Australian critic Rod Giblett has called for a new bifocalism: "The challenge today is to see wetlands as regions of both life and death, as living black waters, in a kind of postmodern double vision which is both poetic (but not romantic) and ecological (but not mechanistic)."64 His chiastic rhetoric presents not balance but stalemate, saying all forces are relative and equitable, yet dismissing romance and mechanism. I hope this essay suggests a different view of the history and meaning of wetlands, and of any place that humans attempt to read or write. Evolution occurs because every phase of development is necessary to the process of change: the ideology of dominion led to science, and science to romance; the conservation and preservation narratives, although they differ, both call for new readings of wild places. But readings alone will not save these places, especially if the readers are busy looking elsewhere. Humanists today are striving for doubled and even tripled vision, moving across old self-imposed boundaries of textual exploration. They proclaim social and cultural diversity, yet spurn the biodiversity that surrounds and sustains human achievement. For many critical readers, the last acceptable prejudice is the prejudice against nature, since nature's encrypted knowledge is difficult to see, much less honor and protect. Ecocriticism seeks new ways to concur with nature, to see it as an environs, or surroundings, in which human lives transpire. If we include in our readings the wedands with all their tangled shimmer of meanings, we will begin to imagine territory that has natural limits, for such places tell us what we may hold close, and what we must let go.

(701), "Love?is anterior to Life?" (917), "A Word dropped careless on a Page" (1261), 'Your thoughts don't have words every day" (1452), and "A Word made Flesh is seldom" (1651). The poem numbers refer to The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson, ed. Johnson. 8 Her idea of place-knowledge is quite variable: she never saw a moor or the sea, "Yet know I how the heather looks / And what a wave must be" (1052). This knowledge she equates to religious faith, the certain anticipation of heaven, "As if the chart were given." Without seeing, she knows how a place looks, probably because scenes viewed elsewhere provide analogies. 9 Joyce Carol Oates, "Against Nature," in On Nature: Nature, Landscape, and Natural History, ed.

In The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the Formation of American Culture (Cambridge, 1995), Lawrence Buell defines place as "perceived or felt space, space humanized, rather than the material world taken on its own terms" (p. 253), whereas I use place to mean both the perceived and material world, as well as status judgments that bind the two. 11 James Hamilton-Paterson, Playing with Water: Passion and Solitude on a Philippine Island (New York, 1987), p. 3.</page><page sequence="27">IMAGINED TERRITORY 535 12 Emily Dickinson, Complete Poems, poem 1740.

Gillian Beer, Darwin's Plots: Evolutionary Narrative in Darwin, George Eliot and Nineteenth Century Fiction (London, 1983), examines how writers assimilated and resisted evolutionary theory as "a determining fiction." Peter Morton, The Vital Science: Biology and the Literary Imagination, 1860-1900 (London, 1984), studies the effects of post-Darwinian biology on late-Victorian fiction about heredity and eugenics. David Locke, Science as Writing (New Haven, 1992), discerns imaginative elements in Darwin that provide "interpenetrating laceworks of codes," while Robert Faggen, Robert Frost and the Challenge of Darwin (Ann Arbor, 1997) finds Darwin's use of fact and metaphor "anything but crudely reductive" or anthropomorphic (p. 19). In Mystery of Mysteries: Is Evolution a Social Construction? (Cambridge, Mass., 1999), Michael Rose takes a centrist position, arguing that evolution reports objective reality and is also embedded in cultural values. 14 I have described other resources in "Some Principles of Ecocriticism," The Ecocriticism Reader, pp. 69-91.
