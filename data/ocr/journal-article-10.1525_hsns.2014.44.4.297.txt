<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> PETER DEAR* Darwin’s Sleepwalkers: Naturalists, Nature, and the Practices of Classification ABSTRACT Darwin used taxonomic arguments widely in his work on transformism and natural selection, especially in attempts to persuade other (typically non-transformist) nat- uralists of the correctness of his ideas in Origin of Species. But, as has long been noticed, classificatory practices in natural history were by no means turned on their head in the wake of his work. Darwin succeeded in coopting, or else leaving untouched, the taxonomic conclusions of his colleagues, because he needed to use their conclusions as evidence for his transformist views: time and again, he made points by referring to what a typical naturalists would make of things. By telling them that the kind of knowledge that their taxonomy produced was really about genea- logical relationships, Darwin tried to tell naturalist that their judgments were correct even though they had not previously known why this was so: they were sleepwalkers, finding their way in the dark, and Darwin would illuminate them. His argumentative style continually attempted to draw existing practices of classification to his assis- tance, and made the judgments of his colleagues into surrogate phenomena that would provide evidence for his views. Those colleagues thus constituted a society that established nature by its own practices. KEY WORDS: Charles Darwin, classification, taxonomy, evolution, natural selection, sexual selection No one definition [of the term ‘‘species’’] has as yet satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species.1 *Department of History, 435 McGraw Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853; prd3@ cornell.edu. 1.

It is centrally important, however, to distinguish between, on the one hand, taxonomic ideas that were concerned with interpretation of the meaning of taxonomic groupings and relationships (ideas such as branching models, archetypes, genealogy), and taxonomic practices involving the choice of particular characters as classificatory criteria. Regarding the latter, Darwin tended to cleave to established procedures.4 Darwin clearly recognized his reliance on the work of other, nontransfor- mist taxonomists, and needed in effect to explain how their work could have produced just such groupings as his own theory explained through descent with modification. Since he used these groupings in many cases as evidence for his theory, they could scarcely be accepted on the basis of that same theory. Darwin wanted only to reinterpret their meaning, not to undermine the notion of an already-achieved natural classification; he wanted to use accepted 2.

As he reflected in Descent of Man in 1871, after his evolutionary battle had been largely won, ‘‘[a]s we have no records of the lines of descent, these lines can be discovered only by observing the degrees of resemblance between the beings which are to be classed.’’5 But how could that be done without argumentative circularity, given that the relative significance of different tax- onomic characters also needed to be assessed?6 Some other means of acknowl- edging the legitimacy of the naturalist’s groupings was needed. And so it appears in a well-known passage toward the end of the Origin of Species: ‘‘the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been uncon- sciously seeking.’’7 Like Arthur Koestler’s sleepwalkers, Darwin’s fellow nat- uralists (those unenlightened by the doctrine of descent with modification), he believed, were on the right track without knowing it, and had often used correct procedures in going about their work of classification without knowing why they were correct. Darwin could now tell them what they had been doing all along: speaking the prose of transformism. The circularity of this procedure seems not to have bothered him.8 An examination of Darwin’s practical argumentative style, especially as it appears in the Origin, shows that he used the work of taxonomists as means of leveraging the evidence for transformism. He tried to show how taxonomy 5. See Darwin’s remarks on classification in Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, 2 vols. (London: John Murray, 1871), vol. 1, 188. 6.

And when it seemed as though an explanation was needed for these convenient habits of taxonomists, Darwin had recourse, in effect, to a naturalistic picture of human taxonomic practices as necessarily mapping onto the truth of things as a consequence of natural selection. What he actually did was to use the work of his fellow naturalists as if it were nature itself. TRUSTING THE JUDGMENT OF NATURALISTS That Darwin had faith in the practices of conventional taxonomy appears throughout his work. In chapter 2 of the Origin, he had drawn attention to the difficulties attendant on discriminating between distinct species and mere varieties. Rather than denying the reality of that distinction, however, he explained how it should be managed in practice: ‘‘Hence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a variety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide experience seems the only guide to follow. We must, however, in many cases, decide by a majority of natur- alists, for few well-marked and well-known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species by at least some competent judges.’’9 Note that there is no question here of not deciding the question; distinguishing between varieties and species is what naturalists do, and Darwin had no interest in rocking that boat. In a now classic article of 1985, John Beatty addressed this and similar difficulties regarding the nature of species in Darwin’s work by proposing that, in some instances, Darwin used the term ‘‘species’’ not to refer to his own view, which was of a skeptical character, but to accord with the general usage of contemporary naturalists—adopting their practices in what they called ‘‘species’’ rather than adopting their definitions of the category ‘‘species.’’10 This would 9.

Determining Darwin’s supposed ‘‘real’’ view on species is a necessarily problematic hermeneutic endeavor, as with many analogous issues in the intel- lectual history of science, and has no place here. How Darwin spoke of classi- fication, and dealt with its necessary difficulties, is, by contrast, a question that the historian can approach by more direct means. As a matter of documentable fact, Darwin frequently invoked not only the practices, but also the judgments (as he anticipated them), of other naturalists. This is not to say that Darwin trusted the community of naturalists always to get things right; the discrimination between varieties and species was par- ticularly problematic. The criteria used were generally morphological (and sometimes geographical) and not dependent on evidence of membership in a common reproductive community; not only, thought Darwin, did such a criterion fail to satisfy the evidence of sterility and fertility as between distinct species (the issue of first crosses and hybrids especially), but his constant stress in the Origin on the differences only in degree between distinct varieties and separate species meant that his entire argument required that there be nothing absolute, nothing essential, about any supposed species barrier: ‘‘It cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed are invariably sterile, and varieties invariably fertile; or that sterility is a special endowment and sign of crea- tion.’’11 This became an especially salient issue in Darwin’s discussion of race in the Descent of Man: on his way to tending toward ‘‘sub-species’’ as the most appropriate taxonomic label for the various ‘‘races,’’ Darwin admitted: ‘‘Even if it should hereafter be proved that all the races of men were perfectly fertile together, he who was inclined from other reasons to rank them as distinct species, might with justice argue that fertility and sterility are not safe criterions of specific distinctness.’’12 He had argued in the Origin for the unacceptability of the sterility criterion, since using it to elevate varieties to the rank of species, as naturalists tended to do, would amount to arguing ‘‘in a circle,’’ whereby, by definition, ‘‘the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will assuredly have to be granted.’’13 Nonetheless, Darwin tended to trust the judgments - Cambridge University Press, 2010). The most popular position among philosophers seems now to be (following Beatty) that Darwin accepted species as actual taxa—one could coherently speak about particular species—while denying the conceptual coherence of the category itself. 11.

It mattered, though, who the naturalist was: Darwin’s friend Hooker was particularly exercised about amateur naturalists who multiplied new species unnecessarily, being himself, as Jim Endersby has argued, a taxonomic lumper rather than splitter.14 Yet Darwin seems to have assumed that competent naturalists largely reproduced the natural order in their responses to it: taxonomy was not a matter of mere convention. Darwin illustrated the attendant practical problems by imagining a neophyte naturalist in the process of joining the coterie of those naturalists who had the requisite ‘‘sound judgment and wide experience.’’ ‘‘When a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms quite unknown to him, he is at first much perplexed to determine what differences to consider as specific, and what as varieties; for he knows nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group is subject; and this shows, at least, how very generally there is some variation.’’ Thus the ubiquity of variation is affirmed not by its existence in nature, but by the inexperienced naturalist’s supposed perplexity. Darwin continues: ‘‘But if he confine his attention to one class within one country, he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful forms. His general tendency will be to make many species, for he will become impressed, just like the pigeon or poultry-fancier . . . , with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continually studying; and he has little general knowledge of analogical variation in other groups and in other countries, by which to correct his first impressions.’’ The culmination of this type of the young naturalist acquiring taxonomic competence is that, once he extends his knowledge appropriately, ‘‘he will in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which to call varieties and which species; but he will succeed in this at the expense of admitting much variation.’’15 He will have become, that is, one of those of ‘‘sound judgment and wide experience.’’ Darwin’s deference to expert judgment in such cases rested, of course, on his conviction, well before he wrote the Origin, that varieties, species, and genera, as well as all the higher taxonomic groupings, bore similar relations to each other—genera being to species as species were to varieties or to sub-species— 14.

This was despite the inevitable disagreements between such experts. Darwin’s assertion that the budding naturalist will eventually be able to judge what to call varieties and what species only by ‘‘admitting much variation’’ is wryly qualified with the remark that ‘‘the truth of this admission will often be disputed by other naturalists.’’17 Darwin’s use of the classificatory conclusions of his fellow naturalists typically took the form of using those conclusions as surrogate phenomena. It should be borne in mind that determinations of the reality of taxonomic groupings differed from descriptive accounts of particular organisms; Darwin very frequently cited descriptions of organisms’ behaviors or attributes based on accounts provided to him by correspondents or published authorities. The judgments of such people, of the kind employed in reckoning some form a distinct species, or a new variety of a known species, were something else again. Darwin turned such judgments to account in a variety of ways. One is displayed shortly after the foregoing discussion from chapter 2 of the Origin: ‘‘From looking at species as only strongly-marked and well-defined varieties, I was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera in each country would oftener present varieties, than the species of the smaller genera.’’ His evidentiary material for testing this anticipation was the systematic work of other naturalists, as he had already explained: ‘‘I thought that some interesting results might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the species which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several well-worked floras.’’18 16.

Stauffer (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975), 98: ‘‘At the end of this chapter, it will be seen that according to the views, which we have to discuss in this volume, it is no wonder that there should be difficulty in defining the difference between a species &amp; a variety;—there being no essential, only an arbitrary difference. In the following pages I mean by species, those collections of individuals, which have commonly been so designated by naturalists. Everyone loosely understands what is meant when one speaks of the cabbage, Radish &amp; sea-kale as species; or of the Broccoli, &amp; cauliflowers as varieties: between such extremes there is often a wide neutral territory in which the term species &amp; varieties are bandied about according to the state of our knowledge &amp; our ideas of the term species.’’ 17.

Ibid., 55, 53. </page> <page sequence="8"> 304 | D E AR Despite acknowledging the difficulties, urged on him especially by Joseph Hooker, that must attend this sort of procedure, Darwin went ahead with his comparisons anyway. Expert authority again underpinned his arguments, which were prefaced by the imprimatur of Hooker himself, who ‘‘thinks that the following statements are fairly well established.’’19 The Origin does not itself contain any of the tables that Darwin drew up to record the relevant numbers; some appear in the manuscript text of his ‘‘Big Species Book’’ that the Origin supplanted.20 The data of the guileless naturalist, gathered without any theoretical axes to grind, serve Darwin as an apparently neutral test of his suppositions. This is despite the fact that Darwin recognizes no sharp discrim- ination between varieties and species, allows considerable variation among individuals, and is accordingly unsurprised by disagreement among naturalists in particular instances. His numbers, that is, seem to refer to entities conjured up by the naturalist, yet for these purposes Darwin treats them as if they were mere descriptions of nature. Judgments of significant similarities and differ- ences cannot by their nature be descriptive, however; they are fundamentally evaluative. But evaluative of what? Darwin’s remark in the Origin that ‘‘the characters which naturalists con- sider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent,’’ gives no clue as to what those naturalists thought they were doing; it merely tells us what Darwin believed they were really doing.21 Naturalists’ own reasons for their choices of classifi- catory criteria were, from this perspective, strictly irrelevant, since those rea- sons were not correctly based on notions of common descent. Instead, the only point of interest for Darwin was the final classificatory arrangement concluded by the naturalist; the fundamental grounds on which it was explicitly justified could not be held relevant to its assessment. The skilled naturalist’s decisions were for Darwin data, to be used as evidence; they could not by their nature be reasons or arguments. 19. Ibid., 53.

When Darwin talked about the systematic classification of organisms, he necessarily invoked a considerable history of taxonomic theory and practice. The theory made sense of what Darwin often described as ‘‘affinities’’ in nature; but the determination of true affinities needed, for his project, to be accomplished independently of a specification of what those affinities really meant. The holy grail of the naturalist-classifier had long been, and in the eighteenth century had become codified as, the ‘‘Natural System.’’ Such a tax- onomic system would transcend the merely conventional, ‘‘like the grouping of the stars in constellations,’’ by representing the true affinities of the different beings found in nature: the result would be the long-sought Natural System.22 Carl Linnaeus had spent his life in search of this system, all the while doubting that he had succeeded in approaching it; his own elaborate published systems, with their selections of characters designed to assist the naturalist in pigeon- holing new species, he characterized as artificial. By the turn of the century, various naturalists, most notably Antoine Laurent de Jussieu and Georges Cuvier, had made claims to the invention of a set of criteria that would yield a justifiably natural classification for both botany and zoology. The asserted naturalness in Cuvier’s case derived from functional associations of the selected classificatory characters, which provided arguments for an appropriate subordi- nation of function to function, and thereby character to character, in a hierarchy that could be mapped onto the hierarchy of taxonomic categories that typified Linnaeus’s widely used or imitated practical systems. Jussieu attempted to encompass a broad array of features so as to avoid a fallible reliance on particular characters of a plant, but as with Cuvier, his ‘‘natural system’’ could also easily be made consistent with Linnaean approaches. The proposition that taxonomic practice yielded a natural system of classification was therefore largely accepted by default in the first half of the nineteenth century even though the theoretical arguments for its validity, including the precise meaning of its very ‘‘natural- ness,’’ were sometimes little more than sketchy.23 22.

Rudwick’s position, that the apparent efficacy of Cuvier’s ‘‘anatomical rules’’ likely owed more to his broad experience as a zoologist than to the rules’ actual formal guidance, is contested by Bert </page> <page sequence="10"> 306 | D E AR Darwin in effect accepted it too, but his grounds for doing so took on a paradoxical cast as he became committed to descent with modification as the true cause of the affinities proclaimed by the classifications developed by other naturalists. By the time of the Origin, the especially influential work of Cuvier, with its ‘‘subordination of characters’’ rule to guide functional zoological taxonomy, had lost theoretical and practical ground to purely morphological aspects of comparative anatomy, yet the nonconventional, ‘‘natural’’ image of classification had survived. Darwin therefore represented the underlying senti- ment supporting the standard view of the ‘‘natural system’’ of classification as an idealist conception of the kind that predated the functional approaches of the late eighteenth century: Some authors look at [the Natural System] merely as a scheme for arranging together those living objects which are most alike, and for separating those which are most unlike; or as an artificial means for enunciating, as briefly as possible, general propositions. . . .But many naturalists think that some- thing more is meant by the Natural System; they believe that it reveals the plan of the Creator; but unless it be specified whether order in time or space, or what else is meant by the plan of the Creator, it seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge.24 Darwin fully accepted the naturalness of the Natural System, but refused to understand it in the ways accepted by most other naturalists (whether based on function, the adequacy of which he promptly impugns, or divinity).25 In order to establish what he took to be the true meaning and ontological foundation of the Natural System’s naturalness, Darwin had first to accept that naturalness as a given, and only then to infer its true sense.

His genealogical explanation of existing ‘‘natural’’ taxonomies makes sense, he believes, of the very classificatory procedures that produce them: ‘‘On this idea of the natural system being, in so far as it has been perfected, genea- logical in its arrangement . . .we can understand the rules which we are com- pelled to follow in our classification. We can understand why we value certain resemblances far more than others; why we are permitted to use rudimentary and useless organs, or others of trifling physiological importance.’’ A crucial feature of this assertion is that it represents classificatory procedures as ones carried out according not merely to general rules, but to rules that we are ‘‘com- pelled’’ to follow. Darwin asserts this idea that the naturalist is, willy-nilly, com- pelled to proceed in particular ways, without explaining the nature of the compulsion. The only evidence for its existence is the supposition that naturalists do in fact follow such procedures, and that naturalists are not, for the most part, capricious in doing so. AsDarwin put it elsewhere in theOrigin, descent was ‘‘the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system’’—evidently all unbeknownst to themselves.26 Darwin offers only a strictly irrelevant ontological argument for the origin of the accepted classificatory compulsions, explaining that his genealogical account of their suitability enables us to ‘‘understand’’ them. But that argument still fails to explain why naturalists who do not recognize that what they are doing is in fact reconstructing genealogies nonetheless in fact do so. As a counterpoint, Darwin sets up as the primary alternative account of the Natural System the rather antiquated view of it as revealing the plan of the Creator, which he seems to treat as a rather weak, strawman position.27 (Treating it as the main 26.

How, he insinuates, could the Creator’s plan serve to direct the naturalist’s classificatory compulsions without the naturalist having prior knowledge of it? But in fact, this would have been no more obscure than the mystery of how a conjectured genealogical origin of classificatory knowledge could reveal itself through the naturalist’s sleepwalking practices. The Natural System, accepted in advance, and regardless of its theoretical justification, always begged the question of its own discovery. Perhaps, however, the ‘‘compulsions’’ did not flow from the classificatory rules themselves, let alone—going behind the rules—from their justifying ontology (the Natural System as God’s plan, or as the outcome of descent with modification). Perhaps taxonomic practice worked rather like sexual selection, discussed at such great length in Darwin’s Descent of Man in 1871. Darwin regarded human classificatory compulsions as resembling the sort of primitive behaviors that made human beings favor ornamentation of the body, or peahens admire the gaudy plumage of peacocks.28 Why females of some species preferred particular supposedly beautiful features in the males Darwin never really explained, except by reference to some shared aesthetic sensibility: ‘‘assuredly the same colours and the same sounds are admired by us and by many of the lower animals.’’29 Significantly, he attributed the development of such sensibilities to use and habit rather than to natural selection, ‘‘the aes- thetic capacity of the females having been advanced by exercise or habit [during many generations] in the same manner as our own taste is gradually improved.’’ The unkind reader will always suspect a vicious circularity in his arguments, insofar as, in such cases, Darwin can suggest no functional advan- tage for these preferences, and is forced sometimes to acknowledge that they could be positively disadvantageous in terms of natural selection.30 In a similar 28.

Darwin had effectively acknowledged innate taxonomic propensities in human beings when, in his earlier work on coral reefs, he noted with satisfaction that European travelers had routinely tended to describe different kinds of coral atolls according to perceptions of similarity and difference that corresponded to his own, theo- retically informed, classification.31 In practice, this is certainly how Darwin tended to establish the legitimacy of taxonomic judgments. He routinely cited what one might expect naturalists to do in some case of classificatory determination, although a subtle differen- tiation may sometimes be noticed between a generic invocation of classificatory practice and that of named, and presumably especially competent, naturalists. As to the former cases, generic naturalists may often be deceived; thus Darwin on show pigeons: ‘‘Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly, I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species.’’32 Or here, on the issue of what we now call ‘‘convergent evolution’’: ‘‘A naturalist, struck by a parallelism of this nature in any one class, by arbitrarily raising or sinking the value of the groups in other classes (and all our experience shows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary), could easily extend the parallelism over a wide range; and thus the septenary, quinary, quaternary, and ternary classi- fications have probably arisen.’’33 By contrast, we have approving citations of apparently dispositive judgments, as with this reference to the ornithologist John Gould: ‘‘Mr. Gould remarked to me long ago, that in those genera of birds which range over the world, many of the species have very wide ranges. I can hardly doubt that this rule is generally true, though it would be difficult to prove it.’’34 In this last instance, Darwin’s acceptance of the generalization seems largely to rest on a reliance on Gould’s abilities to see the realities behind formal criteria, because otherwise ‘‘it would be difficult to prove’’ the claim. - theory rests on reproductive success derived from no matter what cause, rather on a generic adaptive advantage (p. 215). 31.

Darwin’s acceptance of Gould’s expert judgment is worth noting because it indicates not only that Darwin in this case became increasingly aware of the fine line between varieties and species, as he reported, but also that the taxo- nomic judgment itself retained significance for him. He might have decided that Gould’s determination clouded the distinctness of these categories, and merely have taken them less seriously in the future; but he chose instead to retain the socially entrenched taxonomic category of ‘‘species’’ and to use the delicacy of judgment that it involved as evidence of the way that distinct species can be seen as emerging gradually from previous merely varietal distinctions.35 A further instance of the ‘‘tacit knowledge,’’ or wisdom, that Darwin takes to lie behind the best classificatory practices appears in the Origin’s chapter devoted to ‘‘Classification,’’ where he notes: ‘‘when Aspicarpa produced in France, during several years, only degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a number of the most important points of structure from the proper type of the order, yet M. Richard sagaciously saw, as Jussieu observes, that this genus should still be retained amongst the Malpighiaceæ. This case seems to me well to illustrate the spirit with which our classifications are sometimes necessarily founded.’’36 ‘‘L’E ́sprit syste ́matique’’ here comes to the aid of the botanist who might otherwise be misled by his materials.37 This privileging of the favored, expert naturalist over his workaday, name- less colleague is by no means uniform, however.

If they find a character nearly uniform, and common to a great number of forms, and not common to others, they use it as one of high value; if common to some lesser number, they use it as of subordinate value.’’ Support for the rightness of this taxonomic behavior is then found in the judgments of the most august authorities: ‘‘This principle has been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one; and by none more clearly than by that excellent botanist, Aug. St. Hilaire. If certain characters are always found correlated with others, though no apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them, especial value is set on them.’’ This is what even the best of naturalists generally do, and Darwin clearly affords it considerable evidential value: in emphasizing the virtues of his theory for explaining puta- tive classificatory facts that were otherwise inexplicable, he needed to establish them as facts. Thus ‘‘it has been strongly urged by those great naturalists, Milne Edwards and Agassiz, that embryonic characters are the most important of any in the classification of animals; and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true.’’38 Classificatory importance was determined by agreement among competent naturalists; competence itself flowed from an unanalyzable property of such expert practitioners.39 One final example: evidently referring, without naming him, to the great zoologist Richard Owen among others, Darwin writes toward the end of the Origin: ‘‘Naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed vertebræ: the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and pistils of flowers as metamorphosed leaves. . . .Naturalists, however, use such language only in ametaphorical sense. . . .Onmy view these termsmay be used literally.’’40 Yet again, naturalists were on the right track, but had no suspicion of that track’s true destination. 38.

His own detailed work on classification shows similar, and neces- sary, reliance on the sensibilities (one might say, the moral authority) of other naturalists. His principal taxonomic endeavor, the great work on the class Cirripedia published in the early 1850s, in the case of living barnacles contains much detailed anatomical description, for which Darwin apologizes: ‘‘Although the present volume is strictly systematic, I will, under the general description of the Lepadidæ, give a very brief abstract of some of the most interesting points in their internal anatomy, and in the metamorphoses of the whole class, which I hope hereafter to treat, with the necessary illustrations, in detail.’’41 In all this work, Darwin was particularly interested (as he told his friend Hooker) in the light that curious variations in sexual dimorphisms and hermaphroditism threw on the evolutionary origins of sex, but of course such arguments could never appear explicitly in this pre-Origin, apparently techni- cal systematic work.42 The more straightforwardly classificatory work appears more clearly in Darwin’s companion volumes on fossil cirripedes, where inter- nal anatomy was not a consideration. Nonetheless, the earlier work on living barnacles was essential to the study of fossils, especially given the limited number of specimens and the usual large variability of many features exhibited by supposed single species. Darwin, as before, was of course especially concerned with naming, and adhered scrupulously to the instituted standards proclaimed by the British Association in 1842; Darwin had himself been a member of the responsible committee. These standards had made the 1758 tenth edition of Linnaeus’s Systema naturae the starting point for naming practices, and at- tempted to establish appropriate criteria for priorities in naming.43 Darwin was 41.

Classification was necessarily a communal endeavor, and the work of other naturalists was as much of a foundation as were morphological characters themselves. In all these examples, Darwin used the alleged behavior of naturalists to reveal something about nature itself. Whether they realized it or not, in clas- sifying plants and animals, naturalists were mapping out genealogical relation- ships among organisms that could only properly be understood with the assistance of Darwin’s theory. So why did Darwin trust them; how did he think that they were capable of doing this? The question requires consideration of Darwin’s implicit anthropology; that is, of his understanding of human beings and their relationship to the natural world as a whole. OF RACE AND MEN Man, for Darwin, was not different in kind from the rest of the natural world. His treatment of human origins had from the start been thoroughly natural- istic, with the most characteristic human traits, those of moral sensibilities, aesthetic judgment, and intellect, being routinely compared, as matters of degree, with their supposed equivalents in other animals; man was the pinnacle of organic existence, not a being separately endowed with his characteristic traits by God, as he would later be for Alfred Russel Wallace.44 One of Darwin’s means of making this argument involved discussion of the compar- ative anatomy of the brain. Taking the brain as the organ of the mind, Darwin liked to emphasize the basic comparability of the human brain and those of other primates. In the Descent of Man, he confronts his old adversary Richard - Science Part A 27 (1996): 473–519; also Gordon R.

Wallace’s views changed on these matters as he became increasingly concerned with spiritual questions. </page> <page sequence="18"> 314 | D E AR Owen on precisely this point, noting that Owen, ‘‘relying chiefly on the structure of the brain,’’ divided mammals into four subclasses, one of which contained man alone. Darwin’s technique for dismissing the plausibility of Owen’s classification was simple: ‘‘This view has not been accepted, as far as I am aware, by any naturalist capable of forming an independent judgment, and therefore need not here be further considered.’’45 The lack of substantive argument is not merely a matter of scorn toward Owen; it reflected the nature of classification itself: since the enumeration of specific criteria would only have provided grounds for controversy, nothing but the judgment of compe- tent naturalists could ever settle such a question.46 Darwin’s use of the community’s taxonomic judgments comes into play especially in his discussions of human races. The theme, discussed at length in Descent of Man, relies heavily, once again, on taxonomic arguments that are rooted in the classificatory behavior, actual or presumed, of contemporary naturalists.47 After much consideration of what a representative naturalist might be expected to do about the question, taking into account the various standard sorts of arguments for separating the races of man into separate species, or else linking them together as one great species with, perhaps, various geographically distinct varieties, Darwin cuts the Gordian knot by, in effect, dismissing the whole question as insoluble insofar as the term ‘‘species’’ itself is essentially vague: ‘‘if we reflect on the weighty arguments . . . for raising the races of man to the dignity of species, and the insuperable difficulties on the other side in defining them, the term ‘sub-species’ might here be used with much propriety.’’ (He does not explain why.) But then, he admits, habit will probably leave the term ‘‘race’’ as the one that people will continue to use; and so does Darwin himself in his subsequent discussions in Descent of Man.48 What is of most concern to him is to argue for a monogenetic origin for all humanity, as against the polygenist theory of multiple origins for distinct races of man; how issues of divergence among different lines of human descent might be handled taxonomically is of less moment. James Moore and Adrian Desmond have recently argued that the involve- ment of Darwin and his family—including his grandfather Erasmus Darwin— 45. Darwin, Descent (ref. 5), vol. 1, 187, 188. 46.

He matches, for example, the ambiguities attend- ing the classification of South American Cebus monkeys with similar approaches to human types in this way: ‘‘if numerous specimens of Cebus were collected from all parts of South America, and those forms which at present appear to be specifically distinct, were found to graduate into each other by close steps, they would be ranked by most naturalists as mere varieties or races; and thus the greater number of naturalists have acted with respect to the races of man.’’50 Hence the fundamental ambiguities surrounding the issue, which were all appli- cable, in Darwin’s view, to the case of humanity. If, on the other hand, the races of man were the result of convergent evolution from two quite distinct forebears, as in the analogous case of certain pigs, ‘‘it can hardly be doubted that marked differences in the structure of certain bones would still have been discoverable in man as he now exists.’’51 What is of particular importance to Darwin is that no characteristic feature of modern man should set him apart from other animals; that nothing qual- itatively unique be found in man and man alone. So he makes a special point of making the case that human ‘‘intellectual powers’’ are themselves nothing but the highest level of a continuous distribution: ‘‘The development of these powers in animals does not offer any special difficulty; for with our domesti- cated animals, the mental faculties are certainly variable, and the variations are inherited. . . .Therefore the conditions are favourable for their development through natural selection.’’52 Or, as he put it more colorfully elsewhere, ‘‘the mental faculties of man and the lower animals do not differ in kind, although immensely in degree. A difference in degree, however great, does not justify us in placing man in a distinct kingdom, as will perhaps be best illustrated by comparing the mental powers of two insects, namely, a coccus or scale-insect 49.

The so-called ‘‘moral sense’’ receives similar treatment: ‘‘the first foundation or origin of the moral sense lies in the social instincts, includ- ing sympathy; and these instincts no doubt were primarily gained, as in the case of the lower animals, through natural selection.’’54 The image here of ‘‘nature knowing itself’’ is inescapable, but in a rather direct way, and one that goes beyond attributing special powers to human beings themselves. Darwin wanted human mental abilities to be seen as a part of nature, produced through natural selection like most things in the organic world. Only differences in degree, not differences in kind, were involved. It followed from this naturalized understanding of taxonomic abilities, which sleepwalker naturalists themselves displayed, that such judgments were not unique in the animal kingdom. And so Darwin effectively acknowledged when, in 1863, he addressed the entomologist Henry Bates’s work on protective mimicry in Amazonian but- terflies. One species of butterfly, toothsome to predatory birds, had markings very similar to another much more populous species that was noxious to those birds. Staffan Mu ̈ller-Wille has noted the remark, in Darwin’s review of Bates’s first paper on this subject, that the similarity was so great ‘‘that Mr. Bates, with his eyes sharpened by collecting during eleven years, was, ‘though always on my guard,’ continually deceived.’’55 Bates, in other words, clearly possessed taxonomic intuitions much like those of Amazonian birds, even when they were misled. This commonality of human classificatory compulsions and those of ani- mals shows why Darwin was so comfortable with seconding the aesthetic preferences of peahens. Anthropomorphism of this kind was neither naı ̈ve nor capricious; rather, certain things were simply what animals, including humans, found beautiful. But how could that kind of unity justify classificatory judg- ments of similarity and difference? How could it give force to the ‘‘compulsions’’ of the naturalist? Darwin in effect naturalized the so-called Natural System: in the end, whatever naturalists tended to do was, in the main, determined by the mysterious compulsions trained by natural selection.

CONCLUSION: DARWIN’S TAXONOMIC WORLD Darwin routinely spoke of his fellow naturalists as if they had been sleepwalk- ers, groping their way to the truth in their classificatory work all unaware of why they did as they did; he would tell them what they had really been doing. But Darwin’s way of representing the work of his colleagues, to himself as well as to others, is not necessarily the way that historians should understand it. Darwin seems to have regarded the taxonomic practices of other naturalists as the (no doubt refined) outcome of impulses that had been trained by natural selection. Only in that way could he allow their conclusions to count as evidentiary material for his own theories, as surrogate phenomena, without question-begging circularity. In reality, however, Darwin’s confidence rested on the general classificatory predilections of people who were appropriately socialized members of the European natural-history community.56 Further- more, he needed to use their work, because it was an important part of his overall argument; he therefore needed to be able to represent that usage as if it were not question-begging. After 1859, when Darwin could openly employ transformist and selectionist arguments in justifying his own classificatory judgments, he nonetheless con- tinued often to use the judgments of other naturalists (whether actual or merely conjectured), as he so often did in Descent of Man, even without any reason to suppose that such naturalists might share his theoretical understand- ing of their own practices. In that sense they remained presumed sleepwalkers, except that they were no longer being used to provide evidence for Darwin’s great theory itself and hence posed no threat to his assumptions. After the Origin, Darwin felt free to assume that his readers understood the true gene- alogical meaning of taxonomic categories and classificatory relationships. The new Darwinian Natural System had no pretentions to being God’s plan, but its actual form, as well as its genealogical gloss, was built using the judgments of 56.
