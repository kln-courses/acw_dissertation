<plain_text><page sequence="1">ESSAYS SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF: HOW THE COMMON LAW CAN SAFEGUARD NATURE AND PROMOTE AN EARTH ETHIC By James M. Olson* Although the law has felt the influences of environmental ethics , a more radical restructuring of the law's conceptualization of human responsibility is necessary. Yet , the legal principle for ac- complishing this restructuring is not radical ; it is well established in our legal tradition. A variety of legal approaches have begun to emerge- the public trust , "abnormally dangerous " activities , strict liability statutes, alternative liability, and enhanced risk of future injury. They each reflect a common principle: they shift the burden of proof to the party whose actions threaten environ- mental values rather than allowing the burden to remain with the party bringing suit to protect the environment. The author sugg- gests that, where significant environmental values are at stake, the burden should more generally be shifted to the defendants, who usually have more knowledge and control of the substances they release into the environment than the plaintiffs, who suffer the consequences of the release. [S]ociety still does not believe that either the environment or its inhabitants are really endangered. Nor will they until it is too late. * A Principal in Rosi, Olson &amp; Levine, P.C., Traverse City, Michigan.

We must replace self-gratification and the development ethic with a sense of obligation to our environment1 I. Introduction The ethical dimension of the environment has been around for centuries, floating outside the harbor of what has come to be described as environmental law. The Desert Fathers, dwelling in the solitude of arid cells, and mystics within many religious tradi- tions and philosophical beliefs developed an awareness that human understanding of nature cannot be completely reduced to mere words such as "resource." Nature has a voice of its own. It has value beyond the uses to which humans put it whether con- sumptive or simply aesthetic appreciation. Native American reli- gion and lore is rich with this insight which finds occassional re- flection in more mainstream sources.2 Such discussions quickly become philosophical, going beyond the scope of this Essay. Nonetheless, the reader is asked to keep in mind that environmental law carries with it an ethical dimen- sion. The awareness of the interconnectedness of life and the eth- ical relationships such awareness implies seem to be breaking into current legal, economic or theological thought. This is not to sug- gest that this Essay is but another faddish dicussion of so-called "deep ecology"; it is not. This is to suggest that science, with in- creasing evidence, has demonstrated that earth and its spe- cies - including humans - are interdependent and that the law must adapt to this new understanding. The problem is that the very ethical leap we need to make lies beyond human centered or anthropomorphic perceptions of reality. To even discuss ethics is anthropomorphic; that is, ethics centers on human choices, not choices within the domain of other species, entities, or systems, for it is presumed, at least by the human mind, that the nonhuman "other" is not able to choose. 1.

The assumptions underlying this Essay are more than ethi- cal; they are ontological and lead to the conclusion that the legal system and its jurisprudence has been unduly constrained given the enormity of the environmental challenge we face. Ontology comes from the Greek word "ontos", which means being. It has to do with the study of being; that is, the relationship between being and the natural order of things. Legal scholars, lawyers and judges must begin to ask a fundamental question: Are legal doc- trines, principles and rules ontologically true to the natural order of things independent of human thought? The relationship be- tween environment and ontology emerges through human thought and the human ability to manifest thought as behavior with con- sequences to the earth and its species. Human behavior should be judged in terms of its consequnces to the health of the earth and its species. Environmental degradation that threatens the sustain- able limits of earth and undermines the ability of species to live in some semblance of their true beingness can hardly be said to conform to the natural order of things. When thought manifests itself as environmental degradation, threatening the beingness of humans and nonhumans alike, it provokes questions about the very nature of thought and related actions. These questions are now at the heart of environmental law. Professor Joseph Sax infused an ethical dimension into envi- ronmental law with Defending the Environment (1971) which ar- gued for expanding the rights worthy of legal protection to in- clude the right of ordinary citizens to go to court to safeguard their environment. Christopher Stone made the case for recogniz- ing that natural objects have legal rights in his book Should Trees Have Standing? (1974). More recently in Earth and Other Ethics (1987), Stone has posited "planes" or "moral pluralisms" to guide the law in meeting ethical obligations toward the earth and its species - in a sense, an Einsteinian adaptation of the the- ory of relativity to jurisprudence. But these approaches rest on a rights-based framework which is inherently human centered. It is not premised on notions of stewardship, responsibility and trust independent of a lawsuit context. This Essay starts from the premise that to embrace the ethi-</page><page sequence="4">894 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 20:891 cal dimension, day-to-day decisions affecting the environment must evolve according to a legal principle embodying respect be- yond the human and legal rights context. To be sure, there are already signs of courts legally enforcing trust or respect-based ob- ligations toward nature and persons. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, courts began to acknowledge legal rights in and for natural objects: trees, lakes, species, indeed, whole mountains or wilder- ness areas found themselves in court as plaintiffs - that is, through the eyes, ears and voices of humans who fashioned suffi- cient standing for themselves to represent these objects or spe- cies. Today, a step beyond the recognition of citizen rights to file law suits on behalf of nature is needed. Not every assault on the planet can or should be tried in the courts and, indeed, it is un- likely that a rights-based legal framework can address these mounting effects. The way to approach this problem is to adjust the law in environmental cases so that it is respect-based and not merely rights-based, recognizing, however, that these approaches are not mutually exclusive, but mutually dependent. Under the current rights-based approach, humans can, at their own risk, pollute or degrade earth or its species until "proven wrong." Thus, one person must sue another person or entity to prove that the other's proposed conduct is degrading the environment. But the onus or burden of proving the wrong is on those bringing the suit, in effect perpetuating through the burden of proof, conduct adverse to the environment. A respect-based approach would presume an unpolluted or less polluted environment. Rather than oppose the natural order of things, this legal approach would conform to it. A rule of law under this respect-based approach would require persons seeking to change or alter the status quo to show under existing principles of causation that the proposed conduct would not impair or de- grade the regenerative capacity of earth and its species. The common law must articulate an ethical obligation to- wards the environment. More and more, in seeking to resolve con- flicts with nature, people are drawn to a deeper understanding of this relationship, one that is profoundly spiritual. As this con- sciousness unfolds, however, the physical assault on the global commons and its life sustaining ecosystems continues, causing un- certain risks that may not be recognized or appreciated before it is too late.</page><page sequence="5">1990] BURDEN OF PROOF 895 In some senses it is already too late. It is too late to restore the air and water systems in many regions of the world. It is too late, as evidence mounts, to ignore the risks associated with global pollution, such as changes in the atmospheric and stratospheric chemistry, even if the causes cannot be traced with scientific cer- tainty. But it is not too late to address these issues with a judicial sensitivity that is rooted in ethics and seeks ecological truth - an effort premised on the assumption that the natural principles of ecosystems represent a status quo that must be protected and preserved in order for life to sustain itself. The most pervasive problems of environmental law today stem from the shackles the common law has placed on proving cause and, relatedly, proving harm conducive to legal remedy. Global pollution that warms the climate and depletes the ozone lies almost beyond the scope of the courts because of the difficul- ties in proving the causal links between specific actions, environ- mental effects, and damages to particular people. Yet, a growing number of environmental illnesses seem to be caused by exposure to toxic and hazardous chemicals released to the air, water, and land. This Essay suggests that the burden of proof, properly ap- plied, could enable courts to more equitably ascertain cause and assess damages, thus to play a more meaningful role in addressing the problems of environmental contamination. It also suggests that the burden of proof, properly applied, could enable courts to more systematically protect the environment. Although courts have begun to adopt piecemeal measures to shift the burden of proof to the party causing the adverse environmental conse- quences, they should undertake a more systematic effort to envi- sion the burden of proof as a way to preserve the environmental status quo. II. Environmental Degradation and the Institutional Response In the twenty years since the first Earth Day in 1970, envi- ronmental and pollution laws have proliferated. The embryonic awareness of the 1960s quickened into the environmental move- ment in the 1970s which, in the 1980s and 1990s, matured to the reality of toxic chemicals and their impacts on human health and economic systems. Pollution is no longer local or for that matter regional. It is local, regional, and global.</page><page sequence="6">896 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 20:891 A growing environmental awareness is finding expression at the institutional level in laws like the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969s and similar state laws or so-called "mini- NEPAs" which force bureaucracies to consider environmental values before making decisions and to make public the bases of their decisions. The new awareness also brought about so-called citizen suit provisions which give private citizens a cause of ac- tion, a right to go to court, that they did not have previously. These are contained in the Michigan Environmental Protection Act,4 and numerous federal statutes.5 This institutional framework is premised upon several as- sumptions: (1) science can with a reasonable degree of certainty determine the cause and effect relationship of human conduct and ecological damage; (2) private and public decision making will change and protect the environment once there is awareness of the cause and effect of ecological damage; (3) if the public or the private sector does not make such change, citizens have the right to file lawsuits to compel a more appropriate alternative course of action. The institutional framework served well for spe- cific issues, particularly those involving procedural reform. But when the problems are large, multi-faceted, multi-jurisdictional, and involve scientific uncertainty, the framework is inadequate. Pesticides used in the southern parts of the United States become airborne and are deposited through rainfall in the Great Lakes and other waters where they render fish unfit to eat. Acid rain continues to plague fish, wildlife, and forests. Most dramatic now is the seriousness of ozone depletion in the outer atmosphere. One United States cabinet official stated that people will adjust by wearing protective clothing and staying out of direct sunlight. 3. 42 U.S.C. § 4321-70a (1982 &amp; Supp. V 1987). 4. Mich. Comp.

Is this a proper response of the courts to such critical issues? Environmental and economic issues are no longer separate and distinct. If pollutants exceed the earth's capacity to assimi- late them, the very functioning of the earth's life sustaining sys- tems could be impaired or destroyed. All life systems, including our human social and economic order, could teeter and fall. Thus far, the affluence enjoyed in North America has enabled us to be- gin cleaning up many chemical spills or toxic waste dumps as they are discovered. This is not so in the majority of countries in the world, many of which are deriving revenue from serving as repositories for the wastes of the more affluent. Aside from the questionable ethics of this situation and the likelihood that over the longer run such practices will return to haunt us, the legal system, insurance industry, and basic economic stability of the United States cannot indefinitely afford to clean up (often by sending the waste elsewhere) or compensate victims of pollution. Pollution alters life. The earth, air, and water comprise closed systems. The "greenhouse effect," resulting from the steady buildup of the C02 and other greenhouse gases through the use of fossil fuels, and the increased penetration of the sun's ultraviolet rays due the depletion of the protective ozone layer surrounding the earth by the use of chloroflourocarbons demon- strate that these systems can be stretched to the breaking point. It is possible to exceed their assimilative capacity. A difficulty with our booming technological, chemical, and synthetic era is that we do not have the precise scientific data or instruments to measure the impacts until much damage, possibly irreversible, has been done. The multiple sources, multiple injuries, synergistic effects and multi-jurisdictional implications of regional or global contam- ination, such as acid rain, are staggering, to the point of absurd- ity. Consider the parable about the fisherman, Jake, in Lake Michigan who could no longer sell his catch due to contamination by topaphene and so sued the manufacturers. The manufacturers of topaphene answered the lawsuit and claimed that the topaphene had been used improperly by farmers. The manufacturers and Jake's commercial fishing industry filed law- suits against the farmers in the states of Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin for the improper use of topaphene by not following la- belling requirements. The farmers filed a third party lawsuit</page><page sequence="8">898 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 20:891 against the farmers in Georgia, South Carolina, and North Caro- lina, claiming that it was them [sic] who improperly used topaphene, for cotton crops, and through the interaction with the sun and weather patterns, the pesticide became air borne and was transmitted to the Great Lakes .... But farmers from the South- east filed a lawsuit back against the manufacturers for not advising or warning of the risks and dangers of topaphene. The manufactur- ers then sued the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] as an- other third party defendant for allowing them to use the pesticide .... Jake, the fishing industry and farmers joined in the claim against the EPA. EPA answered that the labelling and approval was within their statutory authority, and that the real problem was with FDA [Food and Drug Administration] for not having set proper limits based upon potential harm to fish and health .... [which] in turn, counterclaimed that the manufacturers and farm- ers assumed the risk when they manufactured, distributed and used the pesticide. On hearing this, the farmers from the Southeast claimed that the fish contamination was actually due to the change in weather patterns caused by deforestation in Brazil, which had accelerated a warming trend, increased C02 levels, and affected weather patterns so much that it all synergistically worked with ozone depletion to chemically alter topaphene under direct sunlight. North American and Brazilian food producers who deforested the Amazon region for grazing land were sued as additional third party defendants. Those food producers counter-sued the EPA, and named as addi- tional third party defendants all of the utility companies with coal- fired generating plants . . . [claiming they] were responsible for al- tering the weather patterns; that it was not deforestation. The util- ities sued the auto industries . . . .6 And so it goes until, with insurance companies, experts and news media, the trial space, itself, overburdens city sewer capacity.7 Despite the complexities, there is something courts can do, something fairly simple. Courts can, when assigning the burden of proof, measure a change in the status quo from the perspective of change in the environment rather than change in human activity. Environmental law has ignored a fundamental question: has the traditional concept of burden of proof in Anglo-American juris- prudence been properly applied to pollution and environmental 6. Olson, Editor's Note, Firmament, Summer, 1988, at 13. 7. Id.</page><page sequence="9">1990] BURDEN OF PROOF 899 claims? The burden of proof rests with the party seeking to change the status quo. Unless met, it preserves the last, before- court relationship between the parties. Historically, the concept has applied to economic and related disputes between private in- dividuals. However, the expansion of standing and legal rights worthy of protection - environmental quality, aesthetics, species survival - has brought about a fundamental but unintentional misapplication of burden of proof. Preserving the status quo in a pollution case should favor the party seeking to maintain the less polluted state, the state before alteration by human activity. Nonetheless, a person who, in effect, represents the environmen- tal plaintiff (air, water, land and other, nonhuman entities) has the burden of proving in court the fact of the pollution, the source, and the resulting harm. Thus, the burden of proof, rather than protecting the environmental status quo, actually tends to preserve and protect human activity damaging to the environ- ment. Applying the burden of proof in a pollution context institu- tionalizes the polluting activity as the status quo. Legal scholars must strive to understand and refine our tradi- tional legal principles so that they are applied as originally in- tended or, if circumstances have changed making this impossible, that these principles are adapted, according to proper legal analy- sis and decision, to adjust to new demands not previously con- templated by law or science. How the burden of proof relates to pollution and environmental degradation generally is now of fun- damental importance. Never before have the by-products of mod- ern life so threatened regional, and even global, ecosystems. United States courts, lawyers and legal institutions have the re- sponsibility of seeking and refining legal tools responsive to these threats. While there is some hope for the development of interna- tional institutional frameworks, the responsibility remains with citizens, lawyers, and the courts dealing with day-to-day disputes. How might the courts address these problems in the cases that come before them? And how then does our legal system get be- yond an adversarial or competing user approach, at the same time preserving the legal process's structure and principles? Three key facets of the legal system must be recognized and safeguarded. First, the legal system remains an important device in promoting justice for those not represented or under repre- sented in political and commercial spheres - including not only the individual human victims of pollution who cannot afford the</page><page sequence="10">900 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 20:891 tens of thousands of dollars to prove a scientifically uncertain chain of events but also the lakes, trees, and wildlife. Second, the legal system is an important lever in striking a balance between competing users in order that reasonable minds will agree volun- tarily to resolutions which will minimize or prevent ecological and global degradation. Third, the legal system is an important tool of discovery and ascertainment of the truth or level of certainty of cause and effect. While legal cause and effect is not necessarily synonomous with scientific cause and effect, the legal system safe- guards access and a process for scrutinizing scientific information that would not otherwise be available. What change might better adapt the existing court process in a day-by-day practical contribution to protecting the earth from large scale ecological damage and individuals from increased risk of ecological illnesses? Burden of proof, if properly applied to pre- serve the basic sustainable limits of the earth, relies on present legal structure and at the same time helps to conform human thought and conduct to principles of ethics and ecology. Burden of proof is an existing and well-developed legal concept. Proof has to do with the observation of facts and making inferences from the facts. Burden has to do with who must come forward with the proof and who must establish by the weight or convincing nature of such proofs certain conclusions of fact. The burden of proof operates so as to preserve the status quo or prior existing relationships. Those engaged in certain kinds of polluting conduct rather than those seeking to stop it should bear the burden of proof. When conduct is proposed that would alter ecological relation- ships, those seeking to alter, or who have altered, this ecological system should have the burden of proof. The party seeking to al- ter the natural order or introduce chemicals into the environment should have to establish that such alteration would not impair or destroy the underlying, self-sustaining characteristics of nature to justify their conduct. This would put the burden upon those initi- ating change; those who have the economic incentive and infor- mation - those in control - would have the burden of proof, inter- nalizing costs in the process. The adversary process would remain the same. The only change would be that burden of proof would in some circumstances preserve the status quo of the natural and self-sustaining limits of the earth in its unpolluted or less pol- luted state. When it comes to the release of toxic or hazardous</page><page sequence="11">1990] BURDEN OF PROOF 901 substances or the destruction of unique ecosystems, this change in application of burden of proof is warranted to protect both humans and the earth. III. The Human Consequences Increasingly the exposure of humans to environmental pollu- tants manifests itself in medically diagnosed diseases, undiag- nosed physical or emotional symptoms, psychological worry in- cluding the fear of cancer or effects from exposure, and an overall loss in quality of life. Underlying all of this is much scientific un- certainty about the physical or emotional damages caused by ex- posure to such substances. The risk of possible exposure or the risk of injury or harm as a result of a known exposure is plagued with uncertainty with respect to the responsible party, the harm itself, and the existence of any relief in the courts. A. Immediate , Acute Effects and Problems of Causation A recent case involving the release of hydrogen sulfide gas (a member of the cyanide family) from an oil well illustrates these uncertainties.8 A failure in a flare re-ignition switch allowed hy- drogen sulfide to escape in a cloud into the atmosphere surround- ing an unstaffed facility. A husband, wife, and their one-year old daughter, sitting in their house trailer some 600 feet away, began to smell the familiar rotten egg odor of hydrogen sulfide, as the cloud of gas moved along the road from the well site to the house trailer. The husband ran outside and saw a car pull over on the road in front of the well facility. He hurried to it only to find a man unconscious inside. He drove the man out of the cloud and then returned to the trailer to call an ambulance and the well site operator. In the meantime, the wife noticed that their daughter was having difficulty breathing; within fifteen minutes the daughter was vomiting. Both the man found unconscious and the baby girl were taken to the hospital. When the operator arrived at the site, he shut off the well system and stopped the high pressure release of hydrogen sulfide gas through the flare. Although the incident 8. Warner v. Jennings Petroleum Corp., No. 86-3410-CE, Otsego County, Mich. Cir Ct., Feb. 10, 1989 (Mediation Order).</page><page sequence="12">902 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 20:891 itself lasted only three hours, the effects lingered longer. The daughter was released from the hospital in two days, the man five days later. She, however, suffered from a number of ailments, in- cluding bronchitis and pneumonia contracted about three months after the incident from which she recovered after another hospital stay. The man recovered, except about a year later his vision be- gan to blur. The husband became more nervous over the following year and the wife began to lose her sense of smell. All of these people finally requested a conference with a law- yer who filed a lawsuit on their behalf. The defendants denied that hydrogen sulfide was released and maintained that, even if it had been released, it would not cause any of the symptoms, dis- eases, or emotional effects experienced by the plaintiffs. All par- ties recognized that there was no certain scientific proof linking hydrogen sulfide to the symptoms. All that was certain was that the plaintiffs were exposed to something on the day in question and that they subsequently experienced the symptoms described. Plaintiffs and their attorneys tried to locate physicians, toxi- cologists or ecology internists to assess their case, run tests and testify on their behalf. They were told that it would cost them at least $1,000 per day and at least $20,000 in order for these experts to assist them. Plaintiffs' income was less than $10,000 per year, and the state of the law is such that no law firm would "bankroll" the case. Plaintiffs nevertheless went to trial on the mere theory of re- lease and exposure, hoping that the jury would conclude from the simple facts - the release of hydrogen sulfide and their exposure to it - that they were injured and should be compensated. The defendants claimed a lack of testimony or proof that the hydro- gen sulfide, even if released, was a probable cause of any of the symptoms or damage complained of. The trial judge may have granted a motion to dismiss because there was no causal evidence and the evidence offered by plaintiffs did not prove to any rea- sonable degree of scientific certainty that hydrogen sulfide would cause such injuries. The judge likely would have written in his opinion that he regretted that the principles of law required the dismissal, but that he had no choice under the circumstances. However, the case was settled for $90,000 before trial or such a dipositive dismissal motion, largely because while the mediation process recognized $250,000 in damages, it also raised the under-</page><page sequence="13">1990] BURDEN OF PROOF 903 lying problems of the lack of scientific certainty in showing cause.9 What role and responsibility do courts have to address situa- tions such as this? There is a fundamental unfairness given the disparity between plaintiffs who have little money, expertise or information, and defendants who indeed have the money, control and knowledge of the situation before any release or exposure oc- curs. Courts have relaxed the proof required both to show a causal relationship between the pollutant and the symptoms and to show damages. Courts seem more open to doing so if (1) de- fendants had knowledge and control of a harmful substance; (2) in the exercise of such control, the substance was released; (3) the plaintiff was in fact exposed to some level of the substance; and (4) the plaintiff experienced some injury or loss. B. Delayed , Chronic Effects and Problems of Causation The just described hydrogen sulfide case involved acute ef- fects immediately following a release. Another issue deals with chronic effects resulting from long-term exposure to toxic sub- stances. The courts have begun to recognize claims for damages based upon exposure even though no physical injury has mani- fested itself. The courts have characterized such claims as loss of quality of life, fear of future disease, such as cancer, cost of future medical surviellance, or increased risk of disease as actionable.10 However, defendants have attempted to narrow the kinds of ac- ceptable proof of causation in such cases to the specific question of medical causation, striking at the weaker aspects of the scien- tific paradigm. Essentially, this takes the form of a pre-trial mo- tion or motion in limine to exclude the testimony of plaintiffs medical causation witness on the basis that the profferred ex- pert's opinion is not recognized by the medical or scientific community.11 9.

As a result, in some instances the common law has abdicated the legal system to the scientific community. Thus, new distributions and allocations of costs and incentives for society to correct wrongs that are too costly to compensate are lost in a labyrinth of legalese with dras- tic implications for constitutional interpretation and justice. Whether and how uncertainties of proof of causation are resolved by the legal community in the future in toxic tort cases only demonstrate the point of this Essay: principles of causation and fairness can be preserved by recognizing that the burden of proof should be employed to preserve an unpolluted or less polluted environment. IV. Earth Consequences: Innovative Approaches to Causation, Damages, and the Burden of Proof There are obvious signs of harm or injury to the earth, its seas, rivers, lakes, forests, soils, wildlife, species and atmosphere. These injuries are to a great extent beyond the reach of law ex- cept as incident to claims of personal injury or specific claims brought to protect the environment under tradtional nuisance or myriad environmental statutes. How might burden of proof ad- dress these consequences? A. The Public Trust Many cultures or civilizations recognize the special properties of the commons: water, air, wildlife, parklands, wetlands, and similar so-called resources. In a sense and because of this special property, these commons are not "resources" at all. They each have intrinsic value that transcends their anthropomorphic function.12 In both common law and civil law countries, the special properties of certain commons is recognized in concepts of jus publicum - things common to all, or what has come to be called the public trust doctrine.13 The doctrine imposes limits on how 12. Olson, Toward A Public Lands Ethic , 56 U. Det. J. Urb. L. 739 (1939). 13. See Sax, The Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resource Law , 68 Mich</page><page sequence="15">1990] BURDEN OF PROOF 905 and to what extent people and their governments may lawfully reallocate those special properties falling within the ambit of the public trust doctrine. These limits are to protect the long term sustainability of the "resource" and the public or other species dependent on it. Traditionally, the doctrine was limited to seas, sea beds, lakes, rivers and parklands.14 Modernly, the doctrine has been ex- tended to upland properties that have a fundamental special and public quality, such as wetlands,15 or to a wide variety of recrea- tional or educational interests and values.16 The stage for apply- ing the doctrine beyond traditional boundaries was set by the United States Supreme Court in Illinois Central Railroad v. Illi- nois .17 The court defined the trust as one "over property, like navigable waters and soils under them" and as "trusts connected with public property, or with property of a special character . . . ,"18 The Court expressly did not limit the scope of the doc- trine, but rather left it open to public property or property of a "special character."19 The significance of the doctrine lies in its adaptability to pro- tect earth from the consequences of those human activities that impair or destroy the sustainable limits of the global commons. Unlike any other legal doctrine, the public trust recognizes a prin- ciple of stewardship or trust that embraces the ethical dimension of the human effects on the environment. Moreover, the doctrine carries with it an existing body of law, including a principle that shifts the burden of going forward and proof to those who seek to alter or use the property protected under the trust.

On appeal, the dredging company argued that plaintiffs had failed to prove either the substantial value or impairment of the public trust. The appellate court upheld the trial court, responding that the "[defendant offers no authority, however, to indicate that sub- stantial value must be shown in order for the public trust to be impaired."21 In effect, once it is determined that a natural resource - such as lakes, rivers, dunes, wilderness areas, rainforests or other spe- cial or unique natural advantages - are impressed with a public trust, substantial public value is presumed. Moreover, any con- duct that will likely alter such public trust resources necessarily impairs the public value of the resource. Thus, the burden of proof is on the proponent of a use, aleration, or reallocation of a public trust resource to establish that it has no public value and that it will not be impaired. A person cannot argue that the pro- posed use is trifling when compared to the public trust as a whole. The common law doctrine de minimis non curat lex does not ap- ply to public trust resources.22 Obviously, not every use of the global commons can be con- sidered an unlawful impairment. However, there are aspects of the global commons that are so critical to human need and eco- logical sustainability that, once identified, should be presumed to be impressed with a public trust for earth and its species, humans included. With the recognition that certain global commons - the rainforests, the atmosphere, rivers, lakes, seas, sea beds, ground- water, habitats, species - are critical to the sustainability of earth and are impressed with a public trust, those who seek to alter, reallocate, or dispose of such commons directly - or indirectly through pollution - have the burden of proving that their pro- posed conduct would not impair the functional or sustainable 20.

The public trust, by shifting the burden of proof, thus brings an ethical dimension within the reach of the legal system. It shifts the onus of proof to those seeking to alter the status quo forcing them to internalize the costs and consequences of their conduct. B. Abnormally Dangerous Activities Courts have developed several ways to address the burden of demonstrating causation and damages given unknown risks and scientific uncertainty associated with environmental pollution. The English case, Rylands v. Fletcher™ first established a doc- trine of strict liability based on the theory that a condition or activity that is abnormally dangerous because of its "non-natu- ral" character gives rise to a claim of damage where that activity causes damage to the property or person of another. This test re- quires a determination of whether an activity is natural, and whether it is appropriate in the context of the place by reviewing the manner and relationship of this activity to the surroundings. The Restatement (First) of Torts placed more emphasis on the "ultra-hazardous" nature of the activity to justify the imposi- tion of strict liability24. An activity is ultra-hazardous if it (1) "necessarily involves a risk of serious harm to the person, land or chattels of others which cannot be eliminated by the exercise of the utmost care" and if it (2) is not usually "a matter of common usage."25 Contributory negligence or the contributing actions of third persons, animals, and forces of nature were not usually a defense if strict liability applied because those engaging in ultra- hazardous activities introduce a risk not normally incidental to the ordinary life of the community. Therefore, persons who en- gaged in this ultra-hazardous activity assumed the risk of harm to others. The Restatement (Second) of Torts shifted the "ultra-haz- ardous activity" test back to the "abnormally dangerous" test of Rylands v. Fletcher . Thus, a person engaged in an "abnormally dangerous" activity assumed the risk of harm to the ordinary life of the community. The Restatement set out the following factors 23. Rylands v.

Id.</page><page sequence="18">908 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 20:891 to determine if an activity is "abnormally dangerous": (a) Existence of a high degree of risk and some harm to the person, land or chattels of others; (b) Likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great; (c) Inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care; (d) Extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage; (e) Inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried out; and (f) The extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attribute.26 This list, however fails to resolve a key question because of its emphasis on the location where the activity is undertaken. In many instances, whether undertaken in an appropriate place or not, there is a substantial risk with respect to the burial or release of some hazardous substances or toxic chemicals. A major report to Congress sponsored, in part, by the American Bar Association recommended that courts focus on the magnitude of risk when dealing with hazardous waste, deemphasizing considerations of lo- cale and other criteria while emphasizing the actual risk created by the activity to persons and the environment.27 C. Strict Liability Statutes Congress and state legislatures have passed laws that, in ef- fect, have changed the standard of proof required to establish causation in general pollution situations. For example, the Michi- gan Environmental Protection Act28 adopts a standard of "likely" in place of "probable" or "actual" harm when "the plaintiff in the action has made a prima facie case showing that the conduct of the defendant has, or is likely to pollute, impair or destroy the air, water or other natural resources or the public trust therein . . . ."

Under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), a person can impose liability on a defendant by showing that the defendant's acts of contribution "may present an imminent and substantial endangerment." Section 107 of the Comprehensive Environmen- tal Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)31 im- poses strict liability on "owners" or "operators" of a hazardous waste disposal facility, and has dramatically shifted responsibility to those at fault and even owners who are not at fault. Under RCRA and CERCLA, the burden of proof is not shifted so much as a statutory cause of action is created that imposes strict liability. D. Showing Causation with Multiple Defendants Some American courts have been willing to go further, shift- ing the burden of proof to address specific problems in showing causation. Damages may be apportioned among a number of de- fendants who have contributed to a single harm or injury. In a frequently cited early toxic tort case, Landers v. East Texas Salt Water Disposal Co.,32 the defendant owned a pipeline that con- veyed salt water near plaintiffs land. The pipe broke and thousands of barrels of salt water flowed over plaintiffs land into his pond and killed all of his fish. At the same time, and from a different source, brine and salt water escaped from an oil well 29. 42 U.S.C. § 6972(a)(1) (1982). 30.

Before this case, the law did not recognize any claim for damages for loss of use and enjoyment of land where there were multiple defendants and it could not be determined which one caused the harm. The Landers court refused to adopt as state common law a rule that "effectively relieves the two defendants of the consequences of their wrong, and requires the innocent plaintiff to suffer injuries without recompense."33 The court held each defendant liable for the entire amount unless they apportioned damages between them. The Restatement (Second) of Torts adopted an almost iden- tical approach: "Each of two or more persons whose tortious con- duct is a legal cause of a single and indivisible harm to the in- jured party is subject to liability to the injured party for the entire harm."34 Thus, once established that there is a single and indivisible harm, the burden shifts to the defendants to establish either that they have not contributed to the harm or that only a portion of the harm can be attributable to them35. More recently, courts have taken a broader approach in shift- ing the burden of proof, imposing strict liability or placing the proof of causation on defendants. In Sindell v. Abbott Laborato- ries ,36 the court departed from common law principles requiring proof that a specific defendant was culpable for a specific wrong, and established a "market share" theory of liability. In this case, women brought a number of class actions suits against drug com- panies for damages sustained as a result of the administration of the drug DES to their mothers during pregnancy. Because of the long time lapse between ingestion of the drug and resulting inju- ries, it was impossible for each plaintiff to identify any specific manufacturer of the drug. The court held that the evidentiary burden would be altered where (1) all of the defendants in the action had produced the drug from an identical formula; (2) the manufacturer of the drug which caused the injury, through no fault of the plaintiff, could not be identified; and (3) each manu- 33.

Similarly, in Collins v. Eli Lilly** the court adopted a "risk contribution" theory based upon principles of comparative negli- gence. Here, each drug manufacturer was required to share a damage award in proportion to its contribution to risk created by the industry and in the marketing of the drug. Again, there was no specific connection to actual culpability and the requirement of liability. And in a more recent case, Board of Education v. Cel- otex ,3e the trial court allowed the plaintiff to proceed on a theory of alternative liability on claims for damages resulting from re- moval of harmful asbestos from schools. Like the DES cases, plaintiff could not identify the exact manufacturer of asbestos in plaintiffs schools. Nonetheless, the trial court allowed the matter to proceed and shifted the burden of proof to the defendant to show that it did not manufacture the asbestos used in plaintiffs' schools. Not all courts, however, have accepted market share or alternative liability theories as a basis for imposing strict liability or shifting the burden of proof.40 E.

In these instances, courts are fashioning a rule that creates a new classification of damage called enhanced risk of future in- jury.41 Where a person is put at a greater risk of future injury due to the exposure to a hazardous substance, the historic rule has been that the court cannot award damages because the injury has not taken place. However, probably due to the latent nature of the disease arising out of such exposures, courts are becoming more sensitive to claims for compensation on the basis of en- hanced risk of future injury. Often the plaintiff must show some physical injury or effect to recover for future probability of injury or disease.42 Another response to this problem by some courts has been to allow damages for future medical monitoring and diminished quality of life. For example, in one case, despite the absence of physical manifestation of an asbestos related disease, the court allowed plaintiffs suing for damages due to exposure to asbestos to base their claim upon expert testimony discussing the need, extent, nature and frequency of medical monitoring43. V. The General Principle Although a general theory describing when and how the burden of proof should be shifted in environmental cases does not exist, various pieces have begun to emerge. In certain cases dealing with unnatural, ultrahazardous, or abnormally dangerous activities, the person in control assumes strict liability once the nature of the activity has been demonstrated. In other cases, the standard of proof itself has been relaxed from "probable" to "likely" or a cause of action has been created where none existed previously. Moreover, a number of concepts have emerged to aid plaintiffs who cannot show for certain which party caused the harm, but only that several parties are similarly responsible. Finally the 41. See, e.g., Brafford v. Susquehana Corp., 586 F. Supp. 14 (D. Colo. 1984), Davis v. Graviss, 672 S.W.2d 928 (Ky. 1984). 42. Burns v.

The public trust doctrine can be used to recognize that the global commons can be protected and sustained by a presumption of substantial value, requiring those who seek to alter it to show their conduct will not destroy or impair the sustainability of these commons. These va- rious legal tools reveal a subtle change in how the burden of proof is allocated, but they fail to enunciate a general principle applica- ble to environmental cases. A Michigan case, Attorney General v. Thomas Solvent Co.,44 however, articulated this principle and should be more widely adopted. Although it does not involve a claim for damages, the case states that the burden rests with the party seeking to pol- lute. Michigan's Attorney General filed a lawsuit to enjoin the threat of irreparable harm to public health resulting from the contaminants found in the soil at defendant's place of business. The defendant had stored a number of toxic industrial chemicals in fifty-five gallon drums and also kept cleaning solvents in a number of underground tanks maintained for that purpose. The chemicals and solvents downstream from defendant's site were found to match those in the storage tanks and soils on defend- ant's property. The plaintiff sought an immediate preliminary in- junction to stop the contamination and remove the contaminants from the groundwater to protect adjacent unpolluted property and wells. After a hearing on a preliminary injunction, the court ordered the defendants to install a well to purge groundwater with an activated carbon filtration system. On appeal, defendants argued that the preliminary injunction granted relief beyond that required to preserve the status quo. The court answered: The object of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo, which is the last, actual, peaceable, non-contested status which preceded the pending controversy, so that upon the final hearing the rights of the parties may be determined without injury to either.46 The defendant argued that the status quo should be pre- served by allowing him to continue storing solvents on his prop- erty. Plaintiffs argued that the maintenance of the status quo re- 44. 146 Mich. App. 55, 380 N.W.2d 53 (1985). 45. Id. at 63, 380 N.W.2d at 58.</page><page sequence="24">914 ENVIRONMENTAL LAW [Vol. 20:891 quired that there be no more leakage of toxic solvents into the groundwater. The court held that [t]he status quo ante is an unpolluted environment. It is clear that the status quo in this case is the maintenance of uncontaminated groundwater and soil. Defendants proposed solution would not pre- vent the contaminants defendant has already poured into the ground from flowing into neighboring properties. Therefore, to pre- serve the status quo, it was appropriate to require defendant to install groundwater purge wells and monitoring wells and to treat all purged groundwater with a granular activated carbon filtration system.48 This case shows that when dealing with hazardous and toxic substances, courts are starting to recognize the relationship be- tween preserving the status quo assigning the burden of proof. Despite the lack of a full trial and no final conclusive evidence on cause and effect, the court took the very practical step of protect- ing "an unpolluted environment," the effect of which was to shift the burden to the defendants. The traditional concept of burden of proof, if properly ap- plied, can and should be used by the courts to protect the status quo of an unpolluted or less polluted environment until scientific and legal certainty as to cause and effect can be established by those who seek to alter the ecosystem for specific economic gain, and who under principles of fairness ultimately control the infor- mation and economics on which to base any such determination of cause and effect in the first instance. This approach is con- servative in the sense that the status quo of a sustainable ecosys- tem would not be altered or subjected to risk of harm by actual release of pollutants unless there is proof that the cause and ef- fect of the proposed conduct will not cause damage beyond the ecosystem's sustainable limits.

The defendants must then show that they did not cause the harm rather than sitting back while the plaintiffs try to show that they did. Independent of specific claims for damages, the proliferation of the nature and types of chemical compounds used in products or released as waste by-products into the environment continues to degrade ecosystems - the air, water, and soil that supports life in a region. In turn, continual releases of those compounds and the by-products of burning fossil fuels threaten the global com- mons. Beyond individual plaintiffs, courts have an ethical obliga- tion to protect the sustainable relationship between life and the air, water, and soil of the earth. The public trust doctrine pro- vides a legal principle to express this ethical duty and ontological reality. By hearkening back to the traditional purpose of burden of proof, maintaining the status quo ante, courts could effectively use the legal process and exisitng, well developed and widely ac- cepted doctrine to protect the environment from polluting activi- ties. Shifting the burden of proof in the context of toxic or haz- ardous chemicals is a truer expression of the purposes underlying that burden than allowing such pollution to continue in the guise of protecting the status quo. Shifting of the burden of proof does nothing more than internalize the costs, risk and uncertainty of hazardous products or by-products to those who have the infor- mation, expertise, and control in the first instance. This small conceptual shift within the prevailing legal paradigm could have greater practical implications than more revolutionary proposals. Indeed courts have already begun to take steps in this direction. Now they need only recognize the general implications of the steps already taken. 48. 146 Mich.
