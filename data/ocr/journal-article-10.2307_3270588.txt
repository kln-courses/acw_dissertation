The cognitive study of religion is a young, growing, and promising sub- field of religious studies, with an international research institute (Belfast), a dedicated book series (Altamira Press), substantial representation in journals (e.g., Journal of Cognition and Culture, Method and Theory in the Study of Religion), and an increasing number of thematic sessions at professional @ Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden (2004) NUMEN, Vol. 51 Also available online - www.brill.nl</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 355 association meetings. The basic premise is that religion is rooted in evolved cognitive capacities common to all humans (e.g., tendencies to think about animate and inanimate objects in certain ways). Given that these capacities are not themselves specifically religious, religion is not sui generis: it is defined in terms of specific ways that these universal cognitive capacities are expressed. The basic approach is to draw on experimental work in cognitive psychology in order to explain patterns in religious representations. Current Approaches is an exceptional single-volume introduction to the current state of research, with overviews by most of the leading figures in the field. One of the key claims of cognitive approaches is that religion is charac- terized by counter-intuitive representations: "beliefs, actions and institutions [that] are simultaneously extensions and inversions of the 'lived in' physical worlds" and that "systematically reverse or violate a range of assumptions of intuitive epistemologies and ontologies" (215). Ilkka Pyysiiinen, for ex- ample, argues in his contribution for the presence of "counter-intuitive repre- sentations as a necessary but not sufficient criterion for religiousness," though "not all counter-intuitiveness can be taken to be religious" (8-9). Pascal Boyer argues that religious concepts of gods and spirits "are associated with intu- itions about agency, about social interaction, about moral understandings and about dead bodies" and that these concepts "gain minimal salience by includ- ing a particular kind of expectation-violation" (71-72). Cognitive approaches have much to say about ritual. Lawson and Mc- Cauley's paper summarize many of the main findings of Bringing Ritual to Mind: "the cognitive apparatus for the representation of action in general is the same system deployed for the representation of religious ritual form"; and representations of "culturally postulated superhuman agents" [they now pre- fer the term 'counter-intuitive agents'] determine a number of the properties of rituals (153). Harvey Whitehouse buttresses his cognitive characterization of two 'modes of religiosity,' as developed in his books, Inside the Cult (1995) and Arguments and Icons (2000). Here he introduces cognitive psychological models of memory to further support his distinction between frequently re- peated rituals, highly automatic and lacking official exegesis, and infrequently repeated rituals, vividly affective and sensual: the first draw on implicit mem- ory and the latter on explicit memory. Justin L. Barrett presents empirical evidence to support two claims: "If a god is represented as a distant psychoso- cial being ... believers are biased toward praying for the god to act through psychological intervention as opposed to mechanistic intervention"; "Since</page><page sequence="3">356 Book Reviews religious rituals get represented using the same conceptual architecture as or- dinary social causation ... the intentions of the person performing a ritual are more important than the particular action performed" (106). Jesper Sorensen draws on cognitive linguistics to suggest that magical rituals are character- ized by conceptual blending between the mental spaces of sacred and profane (with the former defined in terms of counter-intuitive representations). Two contributions address the question of the origin of religion. Stewart Guthrie recaps his argument from Faces in the Clouds (1993) that religion is based in anthropomorphism: "nonhuman animals display the common denominator of religions: seeing more organization in things and events than these things and events really have" (38). Veikko Anttonen argues that a cognitive approach to religion "alters significantly the strategy needed to valorize the issue of religious origins," highlighting not historical specificity but rather the human mind's "capacity to generate types of representations and a special vocabulary for their communication" (25, 29). Other contributions address meta-theoretical issues. Jeppe Sinding Jensen suggests, "Religion, culture and cognition are mutually reflexive and inter- connected levels of explanations" (225). Pertti Saariluoma argues that cogni- tive theories need to pay attention to the content of as well as the categories invoked by religious concepts. Matti Kamppinen places cognitive approaches to religion in the context of philosophy of science. Where Current Approaches offers a broad overview, Bringing Ritual to Mind makes a substantial contribution to one corner of the cognitive field, the cognitive basis of ritual forms. The book extends and clarifies aspects of the theory of ritual competence presented in the authors' Rethinking Religion (1990). In essence, McCauley and Lawson argue that their "ritual form hypothesis" offers a "sounder cognitive foundation for any broad theory of religious modes" than does the "frequency hypothesis" championed by Harvey Whitehouse: their model "reveals larger patterns ... that cut across cultures and historical epochs" (6-7). Both hypotheses attempt to account for why rituals tend to cluster at two 'attractors': either infrequently repeated with a high degree of sensory and emotional stimulation or the opposite. On the frequency hypothesis, "frequently performed rituals require less sensory pageantry" (119). On the ritual form hypothesis, both variables are determined by ritual form: rituals characterized by supernatural agents tend to be infrequently repeated with a high degree of sensory stimulation; rituals characterized by supernatural instruments or patients tend to the opposite</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 357 extreme. The resulting model of ritual form, developed in exhaustive detail, is theoretically robust and rich in empirical predictions. It offers an account of "how a small set of psychological variables [e.g., sensory stimulation, tedium, habituation, memorability] exert selection pressures on all religious ritual systems" (179, original emphasis). Bringing Ritual to Mind offers a paradigmatic example of attentiveness to both theoretical and empirical issues in the cognitive study of religion. McCauley and Lawson argue their case, contra Whitehouse, by drawing out conceptual problems in the frequency hypothesis and by demonstrating that their hypothesis is more fruitful and correct in its predictions as measured against empirical (ethnographic) evidence. Their argument is persuasive but not ironclad: the two hypotheses yield the same predictions for "the overwhelming majority of the known cases" (125); and there is relatively little ethnographic evidence for cases where predictions diverge. These books, like other work in the cognitive study of religion, raise crit- ical questions regarding a number of issues: relations between cognitive and cultural constraints; mechanisms of historical and cultural variability; rela- tions between evolutionary claims and questions of origins; the applicability of scientific method to historical claims (where, as in much of astrophysics, one can observe but not experiment); the epistemological status of counter- intuitiveness; and the extent to which 'religion' remains viable as the marker of a distinct sphere of human thought and action. Another critical issue is the field's scientific status. Cognitive approaches are often held to constitute a "science" of religion, because they employ naturalistic, materialistic premises and use scientific method to support empirical, falsifiable claims. However, the cognitive science of religion is an odd science in several ways. (1) To the extent the cognitivists address an audience outside their own narrow circle, they cannot take scientific literacy or a commitment to scientific method for granted. This necessitates a certain duality in idiom and publication venues: hard-core publications appear in journals ignored by most religious studies scholars; and scientific results are softened by a more traditional humanities-based style of presentation in the more accessible venues. (2) The approach must take account of the social, cultural, and historical contexts of the empirically verifiable cognitive capacities and processes that it argues to be foundational to religion: "no sharp distinction can be drawn between cognitive and cultural input" (Pyysidiinen and Anttonen, 22). (3) Relations between theory and data are</page><page sequence="5">358 Book Reviews complicated by the facts that (i) religion is a level removed from the experimentally verifiable phenomena that allegedly constitute it and (ii) these phenomena are not inherently religious: "religious concepts are parasitic upon intuitive understandings and inferences that would be there, religion or not" (Pyysiainen and Anttonen, 90, original emphasis). (4) The majority of scholars working in the field are not trained scientists. (Psychologists Justin L. Barrett, University of Michigan, and Ara Norenzayan, University of British Columbia, are among the few exceptions.) (5) For these reasons and because it is young, the field still has little in the way of religion-specific experimental research to draw on, though this is changing. Scholars in the field tend to cite not perform experiments, drawing on work by cognitive psychologists with no specific interest in religion. (Two of the eleven contributions to Current Approaches draw on experimental studies, and one on ethnographic work, done by the authors themselves.) A related characteristic of this emerging field is the great extent to which a small numbers of scholars repeatedly cite one another's work, recycling a relatively limited core of empirical findings and interpretive claims. The distinction between experimental/scientific and text-based/humanistic approaches begins to blur here: most cognitive work on religion does not gen- erate and test hypotheses; it researches texts - albeit often scientific texts - retrieving explanatory and interpretive tools and applying these to religious phenomena (e.g., what "may well be" the case with religion is "consistent with" findings from psychology [Pyysiiinen and Anttonen, 73]). Further extending this armchair scientific method, recent work (e.g., that of Jason Sloane) has begun to reinterpret historical developments in the light of cogni- tivist views of religion. As a result, the main results of cognitive approaches to religion to date are hypotheses, models, and "general, preliminary proposals" (McCauley and Lawson, 12) that remain to be tested. Yet the field is young, and its claims "are falsifiable in principle and are, for the most part, poten- tially testable in practice via replicable experiments" (Pyysiiinen and Antto- nen, 149). The near future promises exciting and valuable developments in the cognitive study of religion, and these two volumes constitute respectively an ideal introduction and a major contribution to the field.
