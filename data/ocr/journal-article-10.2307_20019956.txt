<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Journal of Politics, Culture and Society, Vol. 12, No. 1, 1998 T\vo Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science": In Defense of Veblen, Dewey et alia Rick Tilman INTRODUCTION Thorstein Veblen and John Dewey attract many critics in the twentieth century. These include religionists of various stripes, political conservatives and liberals, Marxists and other radicals of varying persuasions. Once again in the mid-nineties such critics have surfaced. Christopher Shannon and Brian Lloyd have recently attacked the two men on different but related grounds.1 Shannon's Conspicuous Criticism: Tradition, the Individual and Culture in American Social Thought, from Veblen to Mills and Lloyd's Left Out: Pragmatism, Excep tionalism, and the Poverty of American Marxism, 1890-1922 both rest on moral and political anchorage that eschews the value relativism of instrumental social science. Each asserts a position of epistemological and ontological privilege, and both castigate Veblen, Dewey and other doctrinally similar targets. Shannon's intellectual moorings lie in Ro man Catholic communitarianism, the natural law tradition, and no doubt, a teleological view of history, although he alludes to this only briefly. Nevertheless, a passing familiarity with the social and religious teaching of Roman Catholicism will enable his readers to understand his Weltanschauung as it antagonistically relates to Protestantism, most of Judaism, secularism, and instrumental social science. Lloyd's revo lutionary Marxism serves much the same purpose in his assault on the pragmatists and Marxist revisionists, whom he alleges undermined the American socialist movement between 1890 and 1922 by contaminating it with positivism, chauvinism, imperialism, militarism, and conventional electoral politics. 81 ? 1998 Human Sciences Press, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">82 Turnan What both Shannon and Lloyd share in their denunciation of "instrumental social science" is a dislike of social inquiry that possesses three objectionable traits. First, it is scientistic in that it claims to be "value neutral" or "objective." It thus separates empirical findings from norm-laden ends of inquiry and, indeed, demands consistent divorce of the two from each other as in "positivism;" thus the alleged link with "positivism." Second, it is manipulatory, that is, aimed at control for purposes of social engineering: It aims at the implementation of processes and social values that are neither Roman Catholic or revolutionary Marxist, but rooted, instead, in the evolutionary naturalism of pragmatic philosophy and institutional economics. The latter are adaptationist and survivalist in the Darwinian sense, because Dewey and Veblen, in particular, were avid supporters of evolutionary biology and were convinced of its value for philosophy and the social sciences. Third, this instrumental social science is both secular and without teleological import, for it assumes only process and flux, which consummate neither in Catholic communitarianism (Shannon) or in a classless society in which the state has withered away (Lloyd). This rebuttal of their attack is organized as follows: first is an analysis of Shannon's book with a focus on his critique of "instrumental social science" and the secularized work ethic of Veblen, Dewey, and C. Wright Mills. Second is an evaluation of the interpretation of Lloyd of the failure of American socialism due to the allegedly pernicious influence of Veblen and Dewey and thinkers like them. Third, the ar ticle concludes with an effort to show the commonalities in Shannon and Lloyd's attack on Veblen and Dewey. Roman Catholic and revo lutionary Marxist converge at times in a search for the moral and in tellectual basis of a new world order and different cultural underpinnings for the American republic. SHANNON'S ATTACK ON "CONSPICUOUS CRITICISM" Shannon's Conspicuous Criticism is an ambitious critique of important American liberal-left social scientists and philosophers. He describes their perspective as the tradition of "conspicuous criticism," a term obviously taken from Veblen's "conspicuous consumption." Shannon thus identifies a significant theme found in the work of Veblen, John Dewey, Robert and Helen Lynd, Ruth Benedict, and C. Wright Mills, the principle characters on whom he focuses.</page><page sequence="3">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 83 Shannon's case against the instrumental social science of Veblen, Dewey, and Mills runs as follows: their social scientific work as well as capitalist commodification "demand the suspension of all normative order ing principles as a prelude to the creation of value and meaning by autonomous human subjects." Indeed, he asserts that "critical, humanistic social science, so often arrayed against the market, has just as often been at the vanguard of extending the logic of commodification to the most in timate aspects of people's lives." These statements will undoubtedly leave most readers of Veblen in a state of apprehension if not shock, but let Shannon continue. He adds that "since the Revolution, however, American intellectuals have struggled with the moral anarchy latent in the social-sci entific instrumentalization of all social relations." The conspicuous critics have failed to acknowledge or articulate a normative order and thus pro ductivity has come to serve as "a single standard of instrumentality hostile to all normative ordering principles and proximate ends or values." Shan non, of course, concludes that only "tradition," particularly the Roman Catholic tradition, can provide such a framework. But "conspicuous criti cism" aims not only at the destruction of tradition, but, unfortunately, also at the "liberation" of individuals from tradition. Individual emancipation and self-actualization, which the conspicuous critics esteem, can, in Shan non's view, only be achieved at the expense of moral and social order and cultural continuity, thus his doctrinal animus toward all the "conspicuous critics." Shannon's perspective on Veblen, Dewey, and Mills is rooted in his own commitment to Roman Catholicism as a system of belief, community of religious practice, and exclusivist intellectual tradition. This is reflected in his animosity toward both Protestantism and secularism, the latter of which he perceives as an outgrowth of the former. As Shannon puts it: I offer a critique of the Reformation-Enlightenment attack on tradition from the perspective of the Roman Catholic insistence that reason, belief and even unbelief make sense only in the context of some received tradition of inquiry. From this perspective, meaningful inquiry is never free or open; it always entails personal relations of submission on the part of a community of knowers, and its end is to some degree always present in its beginning. Although Shannon does not explicitly tell us how extensive or complete his own submission is to the Church of Rome and, indeed, the Roman Pontiff, can we assume doctrinal convergence at all significant levels of engagement? Do transubstantiation, papal infallibility, the mediatory power of the saints and the Virgin, and the mystical potency of holy water all join to enhance the intellectual and cultural autonomy of the author?</page><page sequence="4">84 Tilman But, perhaps he means only that Roman Catholicism is an umbrella organization which provides covering laws for the derivation of moral order and ideal social relations? If so, the natural law and the teleological meta physics that underpin it may provide the ethical coagulation and aestheticized work ethic which give him an anvil on which to hammer Ve blen, Dewey, Mills, and their compatriots. Even so, the Pope, when speaking ex cathedra on matters of faith and morals, proscribes contracep tion, divorce, abortion and voluntary euthanasia?hardly enticing policy for those most likely to be interested in or sympathetic to instrumental social science. But it is Shannon's attitudes toward work that are the focal point of his Catholicism, not papal denunciations of what has become common social practice. INDIVIDUALISM, THE SECULAR WORK ETHIC AND FRENETIC WORK PATTERNS Shannon critically surveys the role of workmanship in each of Ve blen's four epochs, as he portrays them in The Theory of the Leisure Class: savagery, barbarism, the handicraft stage, and industrial capitalism. He ar gues that in his analysis of the handicraft stage of development, Veblen endorses individualism. Indeed, Shannon comments that "here, in a nut shell, is the classic bourgeois view of society, one that begins and ends with the individual and sees society as merely an aggregate of such individuals." Shannon quotes a long passage from The Instinct of Workmanship to authenticate his point, but all he shows is that during this era individual craftsmen naively appraise their own productive capacity "in the simple and complacent terms of his own person." Veblen does not endorse this type of individualism, he merely suggests that this is how it appears to individuals in terms of their own creative potency during the handicraft era. More in keeping with the main thrust of his thought are the social roots of all psy chic processes and the collective nature of workmanlike creativity. Indeed, Veblen is a powerful critic of the "classic bourgeois view of society," not its spokesperson, which is an important reason why many collectivists draw sustenance from his work. Shannon, however, continues the argument in his effort to demon strate that Veblen is a bourgeois liberal whose views represent both an individualist ethos and work ethic: Veblen locates the individual as craftsman in society but conceives of society in terms of relations of equivalence and exchange . . . equivalence, rather than obligation, constitutes the social bond of the era of handicraft.</page><page sequence="5">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 85 Once again, Shannon attributes prescriptive motives to Veblen when it is evident that he is only commenting on the role of equivalence and exchange as an economist, historian, or anthropologist might. The workmen may have those motives Shannon attributes to Veblen, but it is undeniable that equivalence and exchange play a more prominent role than they did in feudal society, which is Veblen's point. In any case, Veblen, as a sociologist of knowledge, is attempting to show how craftsmen have come to view so ciety, not how society "really" is. Another related misrepresentation of Ve blen on the part of Shannon is the latter's claim that The free-market conception of knowledge latent in Veblen's account of savagery?the notion of knowledge as a resource open to be developed by individual workers?becomes manifest in his account of the era of handicraft. The fruits of this savage society are never shared so much as collected, never held in common so much as redistributed. Veblen never makes clear the reasons for the obligation of the savage workers to their community, and the notion of obligation itself easily falls away in his analysis of the era of handicraft.1 Implicitly, Shannon assumes the adequacy of a religious explanation only for the genesis and fulfillment of social obligation in the community. Of course, he gets no such account from Veblen who was too familiar with the literature and data of anthropology to rely on Catholic communitarianism as a historical or prehistorical explanation of human behavior. In any case, it was Veblen's view that no human communities have existed for any length of time about which any reliable information exists that do not have at least a modicum of the "instincts" of workmanship, parenthood, and critical intelligence. Why? Because in Darwinian terms familiar to Veblen, communities lacking these traits simply cannot adapt or survive and have perished from the earth. Shannon's Catholic communitarianism is rooted in acknowledgment of the existence of God and the redeeming role of Christ the Savior?it insists that humans have souls and postulates a nonmaterial afterlife. To Veblen these delusional beliefs are merely evidence of animism and anthropomorphism. Shannon strongly criticizes an intellectual stance toward work and a work ethic that three of his targets, Veblen, Dewey, and Mills, never held. He does this without adequately describing or clarifying what he claims is the Roman Catholic communitarian alternative. Veblen's "instinct of workmanship," which is closely linked to his "generic ends of life, impersonally considered;" Dewey's ethicization of work, which is an organic part of his instrumentalist focus on self-realization; and Mills's delineation of intellectual and artisanal craftsmanship are all significant statements about the individual, social, and moral consequences of work. Of course, they are secular-humanist in their locus and outlook, but they</page><page sequence="6">86 Tilman do not ignore or neglect the communal significance of labor. Indeed, they all argue that work can be both individually fulfilling and socially consequential in part because the individual and the social are functionally and organically linked to each other. Both Shannon and some of those who endorse his book apparently believe that the frenetic work patterns now characteristic of the professions and of much of the American workplace find their doctrinal origins or at least their ideological rationale in the attitudes toward work of these "conspicuous critics." More likely, much of the "workaholism" Shannon rightly castigates emanates from corporate-imposed work pressures and the maintenance of firm profit margins as well as with the desire of worker-consumers to engage in what Veblen condemned, namely, wasteful consumption. Interestingly, Shannon has little to say regarding these catalysts in stimulating work pace and performance, although he is aware of them. Unfortunately, Shannon does not specifically state what the role of work might be in Catholic communitarian terms?is it to be under stood in neofeudal terms as a means only in terms of the end, which is simply getting a living, and is the latter to be defined in static terms? Is it merely an adjunct to moral, spiritual, and aesthetic solidarity? Or does it actually have some meaning to individuals and the community in addition to the religious significance Shannon assigns to it? Ironically, the meaning and role of work is placed more precisely in its appropriate social context by Veblen, Mills, Dewey, and company than it is by Shan non, who fails to situate it clearly even in the Catholic tradition he claims to represent. Shannon's inability to adequately come to grips with the meaning of tradition may stem in part from his failure to place it in a culture-specific context. He writes as a representative of Roman Catholicism, yet ultimately he is compelled to admit Islam, Orthodox Judaism, and Eastern Orthodoxy into the fold. Even more serious, however, is his failure to adequately de lineate what he means by "tradition" and how his definition fits into the history of that concept. To illustrate, science, itself, must by now be re garded as a "tradition," at least a second order one, with its own norms, methodological approaches, and indeed, cultural apparatus; but not in Shannon's book where only religious dogma can provide adequate moral order and cultural underpinnings. What he may exemplify is not a tradition but the failure of a tradition, namely Roman Catholicism, to provide ade quate moral or cultural guidelines for a society in which it is not able to exercise the ideological hegemony its hierarchy has long craved. Shannon attempts to offer a culture of tradition, but all he succeeds in doing is delineating a cult of tradition.</page><page sequence="7">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 87 Veblen, Mills, and Dewey belong to a tradition well established by now in American intellectual history and cultural studies. It is a tradition of revolt and dissent?and, if it negates what Shannon means by "tradition" and the "traditional," it is because he stands outside an important if not pervasive mode of our intellectual life. In any case, when the three men he attacks seek to "detraditionalize," they appeal to such traditional American values as equal ity and serviceability. In such a context, Shannon's appeals to authority, tele ology, and unbroken tradition can only grate on unreceptive ears, because he lives in a society where the traditional encapsulates dramatic change and rapid innovation, and where little from the past can flourish unless it meets the demonstrated needs of the present. The "conspicuous critics" are alleged to have distanced themselves from tradition by demanding liberation from its constraints; yet some traditional values maintain their hold on instrumental social science by taking on new institutional forms. But Shannon's perspective on "tradition," especially the tradition of dissent to which Mills, Veblen, and Dewey belong, is so narrow that it is difficult to say what institutional em bodiment tradition might take except attendance at Mass on Sunday. VEBLEN AND THE MACHINE PROCESS ACCORDING TO SHANNON Shannon believes that Veblen envisioned society as being progres sively uprooted through the machine process, cultural hybridization, and the expansion of the price system. However, much of Shannon's mockery and satire of Veblen is aimed at the latter's interpretation of the role of machine technology?what Veblen refers to as the "cultural incidence of the machine process." Once again, Shannon indicts Veblen for his radical focus on secularist emancipation from the tried and the true: Whether industrial workers actually experienced the liberation Veblen ascribes to them is a question for social history. Why every social institution in the modern world must be judged in terms of its ability to liberate the individual is a question for intellectual history. Veblen's rather sanguine view of the machine process is best explained not by his distance from the actual experience of industrial workers but by his proximity to a social-scientific structure of perception that filters all experience through the antinomies of liberation versus repression, or reason versus tradition.13 Shannon continues: Postromantic writing often presents the liberation of the individual as both a blessing and a curse. Having heroically pulled themselves out of all traditions, individuals find themselves alienated from all traditions, indeed, from social life in general. Veblen slights this side of iconoclasm in his account of the individual-as-worker, yet he addresses it directly in his account of the individual-as-intellectual. . .. What is striking is that Veblen's characterization of</page><page sequence="8">88 Tilman what it means to be a rootless, alienated cosmopolitan shares so much with his characterization of the savage workman, the early-modern handicraftsman, and the modern interchangeable worker. He concludes that: Such an understanding of the world, however, issues in alienation from the world. The outsider/intellectual "becomes a disturber of the intellectual peace, but only at the cost of becoming an intellectual wayfaring man, a wanderer in the intellectual no-man's-land, seeking another place to rest, farther along the road, somewhere over the horizon. They are neither a complaisant nor a contented lot, these aliens of the uneasy feet, but that is, after all, not the point in question." What is the point in question? Simply the constant intellectual wandering that is criticism. Criticism may liberate, or it may alienate, but it must be free to wander, and in that wandering be free to uproot any tradition it may find. Shannon thus castigates "conspicuous criticism"?whether it emanates from Veblen, Dewey, Mills, or others?because he believes that Catholic com munitarianism is a tradition that encapsulates moral stasis, eternal intel lectual verity, and aesthetic immutability. Feeling as he does, he can only disapprove of the doctrinal genesis of the Protestant Reformation, its ideo logical transformation by the Enlightenment, and ultimately, its fruition in the secular humanism that has accompanied the development of instru mental social science. Shannon attributes hubris to the intellectuals who participated in all these movements but fails to note such qualities in Catholic intellectuals?what few remain. Shannon lays great stress on community of inquiry, but it is a par ticular kind of community: This conception of knowledge as rooted in a moral community assumes a certain kind of tautology as a precondition for rational inquiry. ... As inescapably a relation between people, this tautological transformation requires not only that the mind conform "itself to the object. . .presented for its attention" but that the enquirer accept the rational teaching authority of a mentor within the moral community of the tradition as necessary for achieving this conformity of mind and object. This submission amounts to an act of faith, which in the Catholic tradition implies faith in the community and faith in the God to whom this community has submitted. In rejecting the priority of the moral community as a guarantor of rationality, the modern turn to epistemology has fostered a social ideal of an isolated individual consciousness as existing somehow prior to or apart from a community of inquiry; however, this break from tradition has not resulted in an escape from circularity but in a shift from the tautology of community to the solipsism of the individual.1 Clearly, either one belongs to this community or a community like it, or according to Shannon, one can only pursue knowledge in solipsistic fashion. More damning yet, what inquiry the rest of us pursue is mere "sol ipsism of the individual," apparently a form of private intellectual masturbation! Shannon then solidifies his argument with this sweeping statement:</page><page sequence="9">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 89 Of course, distinctions between the formal and the informal, or freedom and necessity, only make sense within specific traditions. The modern revolt against God and nature has all but incapacitated the Western world's ability to think within a tradition. The only hope for addressing the issues I have raised in this conclusion lies in the great surviving traditions of the premodern West: orthodox Judaism, Roman Catholicism, the Orthodox churches, and Islam.1 By a stroke of the pen he thus excludes most of the world's trained scholars and scientists from that community of inquiry legitimized by these tradi tions. The reader will note the exclusion of all Protestants, most Jews and, by implication, secularists. "Protestantism," of course, in Shannon's usage encompasses the whole range of Reformation and post-Reformation relig ious belief and practice from Anglo-Catholic to Pentecostal. The great di versity and variety of Protestant doctrine and ecclesiastical organization from the hierarchical, formal, liturgical, and sacramental to the individual istic, emotional, and evangelical can only render valid the claim that to Shannon, all Protestants look alike. Also, to him, only orthodox Jews are part of the Judaic tradition, leaving Conservative and Reform Jews outside the pale. Shannon also denies that secular humanism constitutes a com munity of belief and practice, although it can be traced back historically at least to the Enlightenment, if not to secularist tendencies that accom panied the Renaissance and Reformation. Ironically, Shannon concludes his book in this fashion: For those outside of these traditions, I can only offer the words of C. Wright Mills to his liberal critics: "I feel no need for, and perhaps am incapable of arranging for you, a lyric upsurge, a cheerful little pat on the moral back." The bourgeois attempt to construct a rational alternative to tradition has failed.1 Mills, who has been under attack for dozens of pages, is now used to indict the Protestant, Jewish, and secular humanist communities. Should we be papists all, or do Islam, Orthodox Judaism, and Eastern Orthodoxy beckon? Apparently, Protestants, most Jews, and all secularists are offered these four traditions from which to choose, for they do not belong to "tradition" as Shannon understands it. To Shannon's credit, he candidly sets forth his radically exclusionary thesis. But those committed to intellectual pluralism and multiculturalism using the methods of the sociology of knowledge and social epistemology to understand the role of the inquirer will find much with which to disagree. Shannon's attack on "instrumental social science" reaches its culmination in his critique of Mills, a sociologist whose thought owed much to Veblen and?negatively and less directly, perhaps?to Dewey.19 Some of the value constants that Shannon claims to have found are, indeed, embedded in Mills' muscular prose and rigorous endorsement of craftsmanship. Yet in Shannon's interpretation of Mills, he is portrayed as one of the prime examples of estrangement from tradition, exemplifying individualism and</page><page sequence="10">90 Tilman frenetic work rationalization, tendencies Shannon has devoted an entire book to castigating. Mills' famous proposal in The Sociological Imagination (1959) to empty out the contents of one's research files every so often, mix them together and then re-sort them on a systematic basis without "presuppositions" of any sort is rejected as simply another eccentric venture in search of a tradition-free, value-neutral methodology and theory. Once again, Shannon reveals his own bias in favor of the transcendental values and inspiration residing in a densely thicketed community of Catholicized tradition that many Western intellectuals find stifling. But what is it in terms of formal creed, religious practice, and organ izational structure that such "traditions" as he endorses have in common? Shannon is vague about this, but at least to this observer, convergence ap pears at these points: (1) the tradition must have its substantive beliefs stated in a formal creed and be able to impose internal sanctions on serious dissent from it; (2) the creed itself and the beliefs dictated by it are derived from the authoritative teachings of church councils, papal encyclicals and holy books; and (3) the formal organizational structure of the tradition must itself be hierarchical and its leaders insulated from criticism emanat ing from outside the tradition and thus corrosive of it. Scientific and humanistic advances outside the tradition are thus dependent for their ac ceptance inside the community on the discretion of the hierarchy and the instructions it gives to the laity. Ironically, now that he has identified them, the groups excluded from the Shannon's "traditions" by Shannon will likely be only too glad at their exclusion. In any case, the tendency of literalist and hierarchical Marxist organizations to develop the same traits as the "traditions" will not escape the notice of Brian Lloyd's readers either, in cluding the period his book surveys, 1890 to 1922. LLOYD AND THE GREAT WAR Historian Brian Lloyd unequivocally condemns all statesmen, diplomats, and willing participants on both sides in the First World War because he sees both the Central Powers and the Allies as equally guilty of militarism and im perialism. He also castigates all intellectuals who supported either side, regard less of their motives; and he views the Versailles Peace Conference as an unmitigated disaster.20 Veblen, Dewey, and revisionist socialists are targeted for criticism because Lloyd believes it was inevitable that they would support American intervention, given their earlier theoretical frailties which he outlines. In the case of Veblen, it is his "positivism," his "technological reductionism," and his uncritical admiration for British culture and polity on which Lloyd focuses, because he asserts, these precluded development of a revolutionary</page><page sequence="11">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 91 theory that could have played an instrumental role in averting the 1914-1918 disaster. As an antidote, Lloyd unequivocally endorses Lenin's theory, strategy, and tactics, which called for the proletariat to revolt against its masters and seize power on its own.21 Lenin could see no difference in the governments, social systems, political, or diplomatic aims of either side, and neither can Lloyd. Kaiser Wilhelm, Czar Nicholas, Georges Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and Woodrow Wilson were all cut from the same imperialist and militarist cloth, be they monarchs or bourgeois liberals. In this sense, they were all guilty of aiding and abetting what Lloyd claims was a logical and inevitable outcome: capitalism-cum-colomalism-cum-militarism-cum-imperialism equals war. Prob ably to most scholars of the realist and neorealist schools, as well as to political sophisticates of other more optimistic schools of thought, Lloyd's revolutionary Marxist analysis of both the origins and outcome of World War I will be un convincing?for it is rooted in absolutist moral and political categories, unre alistic epistemological and ontological assumptions, and a Utopian view of conflict between nations. But Lloyd uncompromisingly refuses to temper his impossibilist goals with considerations of prudence or realism. Although Veblen undoubtedly came to favor the Allied cause and was more sympathetic to British life, culture, and polity than to Imperial Germany, he did not actively campaign for intervention or engage in pro allied propaganda. Indeed, a close reading of his Imperial Germany (1915) will show that he found much in the English ruling class to dislike, as well as aspects of the German social order which he could admire. Lloyd's claim that Veblen was an uncritical admirer of England and a biased, completely negative critic of Imperial Germany will not stand exegesis of the relevant texts. In any case, Lloyd pays little heed to Veblen's prescience in rec ommending that a postwar Germany be occupied and its social and political system fundamentally restructured. Such restructuring would involve reno vating much of its basic institutional fabric, including the monarchy, the landholding Junker aristocracy, and the military and conservative bureau cratic elite, who in the past were the primary catalysts of imperialism and war. Veblen did not go so far as Henry Morgenthau, who?at the end of the Nazi era?endorsed deindustrialization, but he recognized the potential of an unreconstructed Hohenzollern system for future wars of aggression. Indeed, he predicted the resurgence of right-wing authoritarianism in both Germany and Japan long before it happened, if strong measures were not taken to change their basic political and social systems and cultural values. This is hardly an example of the lack of vision and structural analysis one would expect of an alleged "positivist" who should be bogged down in a thicket of brute factual immediacy and raw datum connected only by con junctions of events.</page><page sequence="12">92 Tilman Lloyd argues that "the decisions of Veblen and leading SP intellec tuals?antimilitarists and anticapitalists all?to enlist their services in an imperialist war thus followed naturally from theoretical indiscretions com mitted before 1914." These "theoretical indiscretions" might have been avoided had such thinkers recognized that revolutionary Marxism alone gives "theoretical resistance some chance of success." Lloyd thus claims that the dialectical materialism of Marx was the one way of avoiding the pathologies of compromise and the apologetics of militarism and imperi alism he alleges were engendered by Veblen's and Dewey's Darwinian positivism. Lloyd shares in the long tradition of Veblen scholarship that portrays the latter as epistemologically "devious." As he puts it, "Veblen simulta neously fulfilled the mission of the dispassionate, positivist scientist and created the conditions for comedy." It is contended that, on the one hand, qua social scientist, he eschews value judgements preferring a value-neutral path of searching out causal relationships. But on the other hand, he slips his own values in through the back door often through satire and mockery. But this hardly makes Veblen a "positivist," unless "positivist" means any separation whatever of social inquiry from valuation; if this is what it means, then any social scientist who momentarily separates his ideological predilections from the task at hand is a "positivist." Veblen knew full well, despite his tongue-in-cheek posturing, that all inquiry into social phenom ena was impacted by one's cultural perspective, and in this sense he was a sociologist of knowledge, as will now be shown by examining one of the most famous of his essays, The Place of Science in Modern Civilization. His work there is not merely an example of "the idiosyncratic fusion of modern hermeneutics and aged positivism," as Lloyd suggests. VEBLEN'S AND DEWEY'S POSITIVISM Clearly, Veblen believed "matter-of-fact" knowledge to be superior to any other. Lloyd's point, however, is that this makes him a "positivist," which precludes the formation and articulation of a theory of political lead ership and activism (revolutionary Marxism a la Lenin). But, as I shall show, Veblen was not a positivist; even if he were, it did not preclude him or Dewey from preferring constitutional democracy and political pluralism to any of the alternatives including Lloyd's vanguardist polity. Still, Lloyd's charge of "positivism" remains to be rebutted, and it should be kept in mind that he makes this claim against Veblen, Dewey, and others the linch pin of his analysis.</page><page sequence="13">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 93 Warren Samuels argues that Veblen "was hermeneutical and did not be lieve that he could escape the hermeneutic circle."27 He bases his claim upon his belief that Veblen did not think that "an absolutist system immune from preconceptions" could defensibly be erected. But let Veblen speak for himself: A discussion of the scientific point of view which avowedly proceeds from this point of view itself has necessarily the appearance of an argument in a circle; and such in great part is the character of what here follows. It is in large part an attempt to explain the scientific point of view in terms of itself, but not altogether [author's italics].28 Veblen also wrote that Rightly seen from this ultra-modern point of view, this modern science and this point of view which it affects are, of course, a feature of the current cultural situation?of the process of life as it runs along under our own eyes. . . [It] will bring under inquiry such questions of knowledge as lie within its peculiar range of interest, and will seek answers to these questions only in terms that are consonant with the habits of thought current at the time. That is to say, science and the scientific point of view will vary characteristically in response to those variations in the prevalent habits of thought which constitute the sequence of cultural development, the current science and the current scientific point of view, the knowledge sought and the manner of seeking it, are a product of the cultural growth. Perhaps it would all be better characterised as a by-product of the cultured growth.29 These are surely not the intellectual meanderings of a positivist; rather, it is the penetrating analysis of a sociologist of knowledge long before Karl Mannheim made it fashionable. Veblen also comments in this vein that the distinction between cause and effect need scarcely be observed in an itemized and specific way, but in which the run of causation unfolds itself in an unbroken sequence of cumulative change . . . Science and technology play into one another's hands.30 Finally, he says that In the modern culture, industry, industrial processes, and industrial products . . . have become the chief force in shaping men's daily life, and therefore the chief factor in shaping men's habits of thought. Hence men have learned to think in the terms in which the technological processes act. This is particularly true of those men who by virtue of a peculiarly strong susceptibility in this direction become addicted to that habit of matter-of-fact inquiry that constitutes scientific research.31 Lloyd repeatedly assigns the label of "positivist" to Veblen, Dewey, and the revisionist Marxists whom he systematically castigates for succumb ing to imperialism and militarism. It appears, however, that it is the posi tivism of Ernst Mach (1838-916), the progenitor of logical positivism, or some facsimile thereof that he uses as a point of reference?not the ideas of Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, and Alfred J. Ayer, whose philosophy flourished at a later date in Vienna and the two Cambridges.</page><page sequence="14">94 Tilman Mach's philosophy rests on "sensations" similar to the "ideas" or "sense impressions" of classical empiricism. Indeed, the material world may be said to consist of sensations, a claim that led Lenin himself in a famous polemic to accuse Mach of idealism. Mach also believed that mechanics was inductive in that it had no a priori element of any sort. He thus had a suspicion of anything "metaphysical," for he believed in the identity of the physical and psychic. If such is "positivism," it is difficult to see why Lloyd places Veblen (or Dewey) in that camp, yet he repeatedly states in unequivocal terms that their philosophy is positivistic. A reading of Veblen's "The Place of Science in Modern Civilization" would lead to other conclusions, although in fairness to Lloyd, there is some ambiguity in Veblen's view of what con stitutes "science" and how it is related to value. Positivism in its late nineteenth century form, which Lloyd accuses Ve blen of adhering to, is often linked with scientism, that is, the cult of science. But Veblen comments that "there is room for much more than a vague doubt that this cult of science is not altogether a wholesome growth," because of the "material consequences that follow from a great advance in matter-of-fact knowledge." Is the mind a passive recipient of sense data as positivists once contended? No, according to Veblen it is always an active agent channeling, organizing, and selecting data from the external environment with which it continuously interacts?it is purposive in terms of its interest and attention, indeed, intelligence has a "teleological bent." 4 When Veblen argues that "the modern civilized peoples are in a peculiar degree capable of an impersonal, dispassionate insight into the material facts with which mankind has to deal," he is telling his reader what science means, and the "material facts" include both the natural and the social world. Since Lloyd does not adequately define "positivism" and since it is the de finitional linchpin of his attack on revisionist Marxism, Veblen, and Dewey, it is important to give it a more precise meaning, both along the lines Lloyd suggests and in terms of what it meant after about 1885, but before it became transmuted into "logical positivism" in the 1920s. It rested on four related propositions: (1) the material world both natural and social has an objective existence whether observers perceive it or not; (2) sense data are the only reliable source of information about events in this material world; (3) scientific theory is formed from raw data not from theoretical preconceptions or antecedents; and (4) the social position of the scientist is irrelevant to the meaning or accuracy of their findings?what is now known as the sociology of knowledge and social epistemology can play no role in explaining or justifying scientific discovery. Of course, it may be argued that few philosophers of science, possibly including Ernst Mach, ever held to such rigid dogma in the period under survey, but this is apparently what Lloyd means when he repeatedly assigns the term "positivism" to cover Veblen and Dewey.</page><page sequence="15">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 95 Dewey often repudiated the positive-normative dichotomy that plays such an important role in positivism. This dichotomy assumes a basic di vorce between questions of "is" and questions of "ought," between the descriptive and the prescriptive, that which is empirically verifiable versus that which is evaluational and judgmental. As Deweyite Marc Tool puts it: Positivistic analysis employs an epistemology of scientific cause-effect reasoning and evidential demonstration. Normative analysis employs an epistemology of metaphysical or subjective reasoning; it is noncausally knowable. Positive and normative have no common content; they are mutually exclusive, it is argued. Dewey rejects this dichotomy on several grounds, the principle one of which perhaps concerns the logic of inquiry. Inquiry for Dewey is a search for observable regularities in a continuum of evidently knowable phenomena. By whatever caption?cause-effect connections, means-consequence connections, or means-ends connections?it is clear that causes or means are determinant of effects, consequences, or ends in the continuum of inquiry. Moreover, "effects, are also causes . .. Nothing happens which is final in the sense that it is not part of an ongoing stream of events." Thus, ends attained function as means for the attainment of further ends or ends-in-view. The designation by the inquirer of means and ends within the process of inquiry itself is a necessary condition of their serving as operational hypotheses, as instrumentalities in the inquiry process.36 How can means and ends lie along the same ontological and epistemological continuum if Dewey was a "positivist"? To argue as Lloyd does that Dewey was a positivist is not only to ignore his many written statements to the con trary, but also to pay no heed to his long and vigorous debate in later years with the logical positivists themselves. Merely to refuse to sanction the a priori revolutionary Marxist preconceived end of a classless society in which the state has withered away does not make one a positivist. The a priori assumption that social evolution will end in such a state of arrested development or social stasis, that is, a socially consummatory condition was impossible for either Ve blen37 or Dewey to accept, staunch Darwinians that they were. Indeed, for Dewey, such a state of social quiescence is merely the result of a misguided "quest for certainty,"38 a serious intellectual and political error likely to provide a recipe for social mischief. Lloyd is correct when he asserts that Veblen made repeated disclaim ers of intent to evaluate. About tastes, Veblen asserted that "there is no disputing."39 As he put it: "In making use of the term 'invidious,' it may perhaps be unnecessary to remark, that there is no intention to extol or deprecate, or to commend or deplore any of the phenomena which the word is used to characterize."40 Also, in analyzing the leisure class, Veblen says that "'right' and 'wrong' are of course here used without conveying any re flection as to what ought or ought not to be."41 It is apparent, however, that Veblen, despite his disclaimers, is more or less continuously engaged in evaluation. He distinguishes between institutions that are "imbecile" and those that are not?and "imbecile" is not a morally neutral term. He uses his own value system in distinguishing between institutions that manifest</page><page sequence="16">96 Tilman "compatibility or incompatibility with the effective evolutionary process," and, of course, much of his writing contained basic criticisms of prevailing business activities and social mores, as well as the theories advanced to ra tionalize them.43 In summation, Veblen's social inquiry is value laden, his value theory has a locus that makes it identifiable, and both these facets of his thought lie outside the parameters of "positivism." Since Lloyd does not adequately explain what "positivism" is, or what might be wrong with it, it is necessary to reconstruct his analysis and re locate his targets, since they are not Veblen and Dewey as he thinks. According to the reconstructed Lloyd, theories of knowledge assume an ontology, that is, an account of the nature of reality. In the case of posi tivism, this encompasses atomistic events and their continuous conjunctions. In addition to an ontology, a theory of knowledge also underlies any social theory, meaning some interpretation of human agency and institutions. Positivism endorses a view of human agents as passive recorders of atomis tic events and the continuous conjunctions of the events. In the revolutionary Marxist perspective, policies, plans, and strategies can be devised not with the intent merely of fixing events and states of affairs, but with the objective of the complete replacement of existing institutional configurations that are considered undesirable with structures that are considered emancipatory. Our reconstructed Lloyd thus claims that only revolutionary Marxism has the potential both to identify discrepancies between social objects and generalized beliefs about these objects and to provide an adequate explanation?that is, to identify the relevant social causes of such discrepancies. According to Lloyd, when this is achieved through the lens and levers of Marxism-Leninism, a fulcrum will exist for calculated but, nonetheless, revolutionary social transformation. But even this reconstructed Lloyd cannot explain why Veblen and Dewey are "positivists;" indeed, they have more in common with other radicals than they do with the barefoot empiricists Lloyd castigates.44 Perhaps Lloyd would not have stressed so unremittingly the "positiv ist" qualities of Veblen's and Dewey's thought had he more accurately assessed their backgrounds in philosophy. Both men were scholars of Kant who wrote their doctoral dissertations on the German philosopher. They assimilated aspects of his thought into their intellectual systems, and, al though they remained critical of his philosophy in several respects, their view of human psychology, in particular, owed much to him. Veblen and Dewey both stress the plasticity and malleability of the species, yet view the mind as active not passive, able to fix on salient events and processes, yet screen others out. Although neither views the psyche as a "Kantian machine shop," to quote William James, Kant's "categories"?that is, in</page><page sequence="17">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 97 nate tendencies of the mind?caught their attention. They thus assume that a sense of space, motion, time, and even causation is embedded in the brain of normal humans. The a priori categories in Kant are subject to environmental conditioning and institutional manipulation in Veblen and Dewey; but they are, nevertheless, present in the thought processes of the human subjects they portray in their writings. The early "positivist" em phasis on generic mental and emotional passivity and inertia that one would have to find in the work of Veblen and Dewey to justify Lloyd's indictment are conspicuous by their absence. THE MACHINE PROCESSED WORKER VERSUS THE EMULATORY PROLETARIAN Lloyd's central thesis revolves around his claim that Veblen's "positivism" and his technological reductionism both influenced and exemplify revisionist Marxism's political compromises and seduced them into the tacit, if not active, support of militarism and imperialism. An intellectual link thus exists between flaws in Veblen's thinking and leftist support for Allied policy during the First World War. Lloyd repeatedly asserts that Veblen's machine-processed proletarian is largely a figment of his imagination, because this type of technological determinism cannot adequately explain socialist values and behavior among workers. In The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904) Veblen argued that interaction with machine technology had a tendency to inculcate a collectivist mentality in workers, which he characterized as "matter-of-fact." This was a secular propensity to reason in terms of causal relations and its locus was a "metaphysics of materialism," largely?if crudely?congruent with the empirical sciences. The machine process thus induced an indifference or negativity toward the claims of religion and authority and the rights of property, or at least such attitudes might be the result of the "transfer effects" of working in proximity to machines.45 However, Lloyd fails to note that in Veblen's analysis the machine process is only part of the worker's environment. A significant part of the rest of it includes the cultural propensities and habits of thought the worker brings to his workplace when first he encounters mechanized work. These affect the ways and the degree to which his psyche becomes machine processed; indeed, he may be partly immunized to the effects of the machine by the predispositions he brings to work.46 Examples of this are the role of consumption and ostentatious display in diverting the worker from his socialist path. Indeed, Lloyd almost totally ignores this variable in Veblen's analysis. It is easy to see why, for it vitiates Lloyd's allegations regarding</page><page sequence="18">98 Tilman Veblen's theoretical frailties. Veblen's theory of status emulation is easily the best known of his contributions to social and economic theory, yet it plays little role in Lloyd's analysis of Veblen's alleged belief in the ultimate triumph of a machine-processed proletarian political movement. Had Veblen written a sequel to Werner Sombart's Why There is No Socialism in America, he surely would have included a lengthy chapter on the ways in which the working class has been coopted into nonradical politics by emulation of the living standards and values of the middle class and by promises, sometimes delivered, of higher levels of material consumption. Had Lloyd read The Theory of the Leisure Class with fewer preconceptions and had he taken note of Veblen's careful qualifications of his thesis in Theory of Business Enterprise, regarding the socializing impact of the machine and the inhibitory role of preindustrial culture, he would not have erred so severely in his appraisal of Veblen's intent. The machine-conditioned proletarian may develop collectivist propensities, but he lives in a system of cross-cutting cleavages where he is continually subject to emulatory temptations, to the blandishments of ever higher levels of material consumption, and to the siren calls of nationalism and patriotism.47 Interestingly, both Shannon and Lloyd attack Veblen's thesis on the impact of the machine process from the same causal locus, but with dif ferent interpretations of the outcome. Shannon believes this process is a powerful agent when combined with cultural hybridization and the expan sion of the price system, in that it uproots the tradition and culture that he prizes. But Lloyd thinks that while it has an impact on industrial work ers, it cannot turn them into socialists, for that is the historic task of the vanguard of intellectuals and theoreticians. MARX/LENIN AND THE SCIENCE OF POLITICAL SECTARIANISM British economist Geoff Hodgson writes that "well over a hundred years after Marx's death there still has not been a single successful socialist revolution in any advanced capitalist country. Marx's faith that class posi tions and relations themselves are sufficient to impel action has to be questioned." To Hodgson's comment, it must be added that Leninist theoretical and political activity has not produced any successful proletarian revolutions in industrial societies with a history of constitutional govern ment and political autonomy; this includes all of the nations in the North Atlantic Community and those nations in the Commonwealth whose in habitants speak English.</page><page sequence="19">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 99 Marx wrote that philosophers have sought to understand the world in different ways, but the thing is to change it. Lloyd's analysis, however, is so lacking in political realism that it will likely only succeed in reinforcing the sectarian nature of political Marxism by still further isolating the extreme left from any possibilities of grasping the levers of power. Lloyd's continuous castigation of "small property radicals," bourgeois liberals, and multiclass political coalitions; his systematic denigration of American trade unions and organized labor; and his deep-rooted distrust of electoral politics may provide him with visceral ideo logical and moral gratification. But it will not bring us more progressive politics. However novel critics may find Lloyd's study, its political message is uncom pelling to any knowledgeable student of American politics. To illustrate the political impotence of revolutionary Marxism, it is in teresting to note that the political movements to the left of the New Deal in the 1930s often voted with the New Deal from 1933 to 1938, enough at times to make a difference. A number of the Senators and Congressmen who par ticipated on the left fringe of the New Deal were familiar with Veblen's writ ings, and of course, Dewey was a key political activist in the League for Independent Political Action and the People's Lobby. Progressives, Farm-La borites, former Non-Partisan Leaguers, and radical Democrats were present in considerable numbers in the U.S. Congress in the 1930s. Moreover, the Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President Henry A. Wallace knew Veblen and was a Veblen scholar himself. Representatives Thomas Amlie, Maury Maverick, Robert Allen, and Jerry Voorhis all knew Veblen's ideas passably well and attempted to implement them in industrial expansion bills.49 It is fair to say that this is the closest the American Left has gotten to power in the twentieth century and it did not get there using Karl Marx or an unleavened proletarian politics. In fairness to Lloyd, his book does not cover this period; but if it did, what else could he conceivably do other than castigate the leftward fringe of the New Deal, given the influence on it of his two favorite targets, Veblen and Dewey? Lloyd sanctions an admirable set of moral principles and social ide als?his brave new world will be free from poverty, racism, ethnocentrism, and gender bias. Also, and in a positive vein, human community, social solidarity, and individual and collective altruism will flourish. Social tran quility, domestic harmony and international peace will become the order of the day. Indeed, it is fair to say that his ideal society will encapsulate all that Edward Bellamy postulated in Looking Backward and its sequel, Equality. Interestingly, Lloyd has little to say regarding Bellamy and the Nationalist movement, despite the great influence they had in the period his book surveys. Why? No doubt, because of the lack of influence on them wielded by Karl Marx, who with Lenin, in Lloyd's view, are the political and intellectual pivots of Western civilization.</page><page sequence="20">100 Tilman Lloyd's very partial interpretation of Marx appears to be almost en tirely derived from Lenin and, perhaps, Neo-Leninist theory. Lloyd's Marxism is vanguardist, revolutionary, and insurrectionist in that Lenin is perceived to exemplify Marx theoretically and practically. Of course, Lloyd's Lenin (and Marx) hold the key to both history and the future, since they understand both the tactics and strategy essential to the seizure of power ordained by the proletariat (actually its leaders). What other classes, including that part of the working class resistant to Lloydist Leninism, think or want simply does not matter except insofar as it constitutes an obstacle to revolutionary political change. Lloyd fails to adequately note that many pre-War left wing socialists, including some who had known Marx and Engels personally, regarded Lenin as a fanatic, an ideologue, and a vision ary long before he seized power. If Lenin, the argument goes, had lived longer and maintained himself in power, his supporters would likely have continued to be Trotsky, Bukharin, Kamenev and Zinoviev, or "moderates" like them rather than Stalin, Molotov, and their henchmen. A plausible reading of such a regime is that it would have been more flexible and mod erate than the Stalinist regime that emerged. Of course, the problem with this scenario is that it never materialized. Nevertheless, Lloyd writes that we are witnessing not the death of Marxism, but the end of the first period during which Marxists managed to seize and, for a time, wield state power. That it has fewer adherents at the end than during other phases of this period, and that as many of them can be found in universities as in factories or fields, is neither as disheartening as is imagined by some of its proponents nor as amusing as is supposed by all of its detractors. He then comments that "disputes about what it means to espouse Marxism and how a Marxist organization might lead a socialist revolution rank among the most vital subjects for historical study." He ignores these astute judgments by the late C. Wright Mills, who sometimes called himself a "plain Marxist" and took Marx seriously in the latter's own time and po litical context: Behind the labor metaphysic and the erroneous view of its supporting trends there are deficiencies in the Marxist categories of stratification; ambiguities and misjudgments about the psychological and political consequences of the development of the economic base; errors concerning the supremacy of economic causes within the history of societies and the mentality of classes; inadequacies of a rationalist psychological theory; a generally erroneous theory of power; an inadequate conception of the state. Even being as generous as possible in our application to Marx's work of his own principle of historic specificity, we find him too wrong on too many points. The political, psychological and economic expectations clearly derivable from his work seem increasingly unreal, his model as a whole increasingly inadequate. His theories bear the stamp of Victorian capitalism. It is little wonder: that is what they are about. We must accuse him of dying, his work unfinished, in 1883. l</page><page sequence="21">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 101 Lloyd's "Marxism" is heavily infected by vanguardism; thus his continuous praise and endorsement of Lenin and Leninism and his reiteration of the view that the theory and leadership of intellectuals is vitally essential to the success of any revolutionary movement. Both Lenin and Trotsky were men undoubtedly cut from a heroic mold, possessed of great courage and leadership qualities, of powerful intellect and considerable theoretical acumen, yet; Winston Churchill concluded that Lenin's birth was the worst thing that ever happened to the Russian people?but his early death the second worst occurrence, since it opened the door to a leadership vacuum and conflict in which Stalin emerged the victor. But Lloyd dismisses Lenin's dismissal of the Constituent Assembly, after the only free election ever held on Russian soil, with the claim that the victors who represented the center and the moderate left had no legitimate claim on power, since they had already sold out!52 He thus unequivocally en dorses the victory of Bolshevism in Russia, including its tactics, aims and strate gies. By drawing upon an exotic political culture and alien intellectual tradition that is essentially Russian, his analysis of U.S. political and doctrinal history appears even more irrelevant than classical Marxism to understanding the na ture of change in industrial societies like our own. Lloyd is sometimes astute in his criticisms of Allied geopolitical aims be tween 1914 and 1919 and after, but it is hardly necessary to swallow whole his apparent endorsement of Leninist and neo-Leninist views of the interwar period, the Cold War, and after. Indeed, in his closing chapter he is contemptuous even of the American New Left for its bourgeois liberal failure to adopt revolutionary Marxism as its creed during the 1960s and early 1970s. It seems not to have occurred to Lloyd that most of the New Left were indifferent toward or ignorant of Veblen and Dewey, who were more knowledgeable regarding American cul ture, social structure, and polity than most Marxists. Nor does he appreciate the fact that it was New Left obliviousness toward these two men and thinkers like them that was its chief doctrinal error and lead, ultimately, to the sectarian iso lation of the left wing of the movement and its political disintegration. CONCLUSION If I have properly understood Lloyd, "positivist" convictions make one unable to engage in praxis; by this he seems to mean that positivists cannot adequately theorize in the social sciences. Members of this intellectual tradition are theoretically incapacitated from engaging in anything but instrumental social science inquiry, which is morally and politically illicit. Also, the inquirer is in capable of formulating strategy and tactics as political means relating to revo lutionary ends, because positivist philosophical predilections make it impossible to link theory with action in any adequate fashion.</page><page sequence="22">102 Tilman Contrary to Lloyd's interpretation of them as theoretically incapaci tated "positivists," Veblen and Dewey recognized that value judgements were embedded in social inquiry in the sense that, if inquiry was pur posive?and in their view it surely was?it was also value laden. In this sense, value-premises focus and direct inquiry by defining relevance and significance. It is no accident that the New Deal and political movements to its immediate left were influenced by both men. One serious problem Lloyd faces is interpreting the impact of Veblen on the revisionist socialists he attacks. How did Robert R. Lamont, William English Walling, Walter Lippmann, John Spargo, Morris Hillquit, and Vic tor Berger interpret Veblen when they read him. Is Lloyd correct in his assertions as to how Veblen influenced these men? Although Lloyd has done a massive reading of both primary and secondary literature, he has done virtually no archival research on any of the major figures in his book. Indeed, the collections containing unpublished materials which might shed light on the revisionist socialist reading of Veblen are not even mentioned. This is an even more serious shortcoming in Shannon's Conspicuous Criti cism. Granted, Shannon's study is a recent doctoral dissertation turned into a book by Johns Hopkins Press; still, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the author should at least have researched the papers of Veblen, Dewey, and Mills, most of which were available while he was working on his doctorate. Why the reluctance of Lloyd and Shannon to do serious archival re search? The expense of doing so is obvious and the difficulty of obtaining research grants is apparent. But it may also be attributable to pressure to publish, the bete noire of young scholars looking for tenure-track jobs, ten ure, merit, and promotion. Or it may be due to their belief that major thinkers have said all they have to say in published form so that little is to be gained by archival work. However, works as novel and as critical of conventional wisdom, as these two books clearly are, should use any re search materials available to strengthen their case. Predictably, reviewers will comment on these flaws in both books; they are compounded in Shan non's case by the fact that he has not read, or at least does not cite, important secondary sources. Left Out is often marred by Lloyd's own crotchets, which he claims are mere logical extrapolations from his own revolutionary Marxist doc trinal position. These particular idiosyncratic value judgements include the castigation of Britain, especially English institutions and culture, Anglo philes and Anglophilia, liberalism, pragmatism both as politics and philosophy, empiricism both as method and philosophy, electoral politics, and ultimately all intellectual and cultural tendencies that lend credence or sanction to the above. Indeed, so often is Britain the target of his attack</page><page sequence="23">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 103 that, in the final analysis, the reader could easily conclude that his target is not merely its ruling class and the institutions they so long dominated, but English culture itself. Lloyd's assault on British institutions and their role in establishing and maintaining an imperialist and colonial order are understandable, given his Marxist proclivities. Yet, he clearly cherishes an animus against its culture and ideas, especially when they have lent weight to or influenced Anglo-American thought. Lloyd's treatment of Dewey, William James, and Veblen are evidence of this animus. He detests the long-time ideological dominance of Anglo-Saxon thought and culture in the Western world, and Left Out is a tract aimed at exposing its allegedly pernicious nature and role. However, Lloyd is so tied to conventional Marx ist labels by his theoretical preconceptions that, in the final analysis, everyone except revolutionary Marxists like himself, succumbs to Cold War riorism, corporate liberalism, bourgeois apologetics, imperialism, militarism, and so forth. Perhaps it is he who is "left out" rather than those capable of making more discerning political judgements because they are possessed of the political realism he so conspicuously lacks? Specifically, how do Shannon and Lloyd approach morality particu larly at the point where ethics converges with politics; and how do their approaches differ from those of Dewey and Veblen? However different they may be in other respects, Shannon and Lloyd have this in common: for them (1) morality is immanent, that is, embedded in the natural or social order, either by God (Shannon) or as a progressive potency rooted in the social and class structure (Lloyd); (2) the perfected form of this morality is waiting to manifest itself in the mission of Catholic communi tarianism or the proletariat and; (3) morality, be it Catholic or proletarian, is not merely a social or cultural contrivances?it is a transcultural phe nomenon that must take on a particular set of organizational and institutional forms if humankind is to become really "human," in the fullest sense of the term. What Peter Hare calls the "progressive enrichment of evolutionary naturalism," the intellectual endeavor of which Dewey and Ve blen were a part, is thus incompatible with what Shannon and Lloyd prognosticate for the evolution of the social sciences and American culture, for it rests on no such set of assumptions. Are Shannon's and Lloyd's attacks on Veblen and Dewey linked, other than as a mere case of incidental or casual convergence? Also, what do these two studies published in the same series by Johns Hopkins University Press within a year of each other portend regarding intellectual and scholarly trends in modern history and the social sciences? In answer to both questions, it appears that in an age of relativism and uncertainty, Shannon and Lloyd have found the moral anchorage and political moorings they believe are essential for proper social inquiry. In the case of Shannon, it is the natural law tradition</page><page sequence="24">104 Tilman and the authoritative moral and social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church that provide the substratum. For Lloyd, it is revolutionary Marxism and dialectical materialism of the Leninist ilk, or at least something approximating it, that provides the ground of attachment. That Veblen and Dewey, among others, are their targets is not surprising. When Veblen used the term "imbecile institutions," he undoubtedly meant it as an umbrella definition that included the Roman Catholic Church; and however sympathetic he may have been for a time toward Bolshevism, he was highly critical of classical Marxism in his writings.54 Dewey's unpublished papers include correspondence in which he expresses dislike for Roman Catholicism and skepticism regarding the motives of its apologists and converts, and of course, he never took theoretical Marxism perhaps as seriously as he should.55 It is well known that he strongly disliked and distrusted the American Communist Party and the Comintern, especially after presiding over the Trotsky Commission hearings, which exonerated Trotsky of the charges made by Stalinists against him. Both Veblen and Dewey were secular humanists from strong Protestant backgrounds, and neither viewed Roman Catholicism or Marxism as the intellectual pivot of Western, much less American, civilization. What clearly ties Shannon and Lloyd together is their belief that they have creeds from which fundamental moral sustenance and critical perspective can be derived. They are not the first, nor will they be the last, to seek such security in religious dogma, as in the case of Shannon, or, the messianic and chiliastic claims of revolutionary Marxism, as in the case of Lloyd. It is no accident that both critics attack "instrumental social science" in their quest for moral stasis, immutable social truths, and eternal cultural verities. Then, too, there is the issue of the current ideological trends?and the historical and social structural changes that may have induced them?invad ing the social sciences. Why the retreat to fortresses Marxism and Roman Catholicism? Why the endorsement of Shannon's book by political scientist Jean Bethke Elshtain and the acknowledgments by Lloyd in his preface of Dorothy Ross, Tom Bender, and David Hollinger, all luminaries in the schol arly world? Clearly, these scholars are not personally responsible or politically and doctrinally culpable for what Shannon and Lloyd have written. Still, one cannot help but ponder the question as to what their involvement in such idiosyncratic scholarly projects portends for the future. Social scientists and historians are usually eager to detect new trends in their own and related disciplines; sometimes these are methodological and conceptual, but more often, they anticipate cultural, moral, and political shifts or transformations. It is these latter three in which Lloyd and Shannon will likely excel as catalysts. In this regard, there is no denying that for many contemporary scholars, the more extreme forms of moral and political</page><page sequence="25">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 105 relativism leave much to be desired, for several reasons. One is that moral and political discourses are badly crippled without the availability of some fairly explicit methodological and normative framework in which they may be expressed. Another is that scholars and intellectuals are political and moral animals who cannot rationally engage in moral or political action without some anchorage or mooring. A third is that their audiences cannot adequately orient themselves to their messages if the moral and political component of such messages is hidden, disguised, or simply missing. In these respects, the two authors must be credited with insisting on a more explicit and systematic integration of value with social inquiry. Clearly, the two books signify the efforts of younger scholars to come to grips with the value relativism,56 social and political impermanency, and the cultural conflict and dislocation of their generation. But it seems unlikely that many will follow their suit by embracing religious communitarianism or revolutionary Marxism. Nevertheless, however eccentric the two authors may seem to defenders of the instrumentalized "positivist" social scientists they castigate, they represent an effort both to revive the old intellectual tradi tions of Catholic communitarianism and classical Marxism, as well as show ing the relevance of the value constants that form the core of these traditions. Psychological reductionism usually thrusts the burden of proof on those who resort to it; but Lloyd and Shannon may be symptomatic of marginalized elements in the contemporary scholarly world whose motives and aims are explicable in terms of an emerging social-psychological profile. They are likely to find, however, that few of their peers fit this profile.

This reconstruction of Lloyd closely follows the attack on positivism by Cambridge economist Tony Lawson in his "The Nature of Postkeynesianism and Its Links to Other Traditions," in David L. Prychitko, ed. Why Economists Disagree (Albany: SUNY Press, 1998), pp. 115-152. However, Lawson has located authentic contemporary positivists to criticize, not imaginary doctrinal opponents like Veblen and Dewey. Lawson, in turn, relies on contemporary British philosopher Roy Bhaskar's "critical realism" for his critique of positivism.</page><page sequence="27">Two Recent Critics of "Instrumental Social Science" 107 45.

To illustrate the larger point, the moral agnosticism of much of contemporary mainline economics (often referred to by heterodox economists as "neoclassical") induces grave difficulty into the interpersonal comparison of utilities on the part of consumers, because it cannot identify any hierarchy of wants or any significant role for altruism and empathie behavior. To make matters worse, few economists of this ilk are even willing to investigate wasteful consumption because of their moral agnosticism. For who can say what is wasteful, unnecessary, or degenerative (pathological) consumption without some prioritizing of human needs, and who can say what these amount to, without admitting to a hierarchy of values? To put new words but old meaning into the adage of Jeremy Bentham "dogshit is as good (or as bad) as beefsteak," since consumption is only a matter of subjective, individual preference anyway!</page></plain_text>
