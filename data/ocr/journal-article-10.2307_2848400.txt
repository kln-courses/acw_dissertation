<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WRATH OF DANTE BY G. A. BORGESE EVEN more than by the burning pinnacles of the city of Satan, the eighth canto of Dante's Inferno is dominated by the episode of Filippo Argenti. Out of the dark marsh of Styx, allotted to the wrathful, which Dante and Virgil are crossing on the Devil Phlegyas's boat, one inmate, 'full of mud,' rises before the visitor: 'Who art thou that comest before thy time?' And I to him: 'If I come, I remain not; but thou, who art thou, that hast become so foul?' He answered: 'Thou seest that I am one who weep.' And I to him: 'With weeping, and with sorrow, accursed spirit, remain thou! for I know thee, all filthy as thou art.' Then he stretched both hands to the boat, whereat the wary master thrust him off, saying: 'Away there with the other dogs!' And he put his arms around my neck, kissed my face, and said: 'Indignant soul! blessed be she that bore thee. In your world that was an arrogant personage; good there is none to ornament the memory of him: so is his shadow here in rage. How many above there now think themselves great kings, that shall lie here like swine in mire, leaving behind them horrible reproaches!' And I: 'Master, I should be glad to see him dipped in this swill, ere we quit the lake.' And he to me: 'Before the shore comes to thy view, thou shalt be satisfied; it is fitting that thou shouldst be gratified in such a wish!' A little after this, I saw the muddy people make such rending of him that even now I praise and thank God for it. All cried: 'At Filippo Argenti!' The passionate Florentine spirit turned with his teeth upon himself. Here we left him, so that of him I tell no more. Contemporary or early testimonies provide us with a consistent although sketchy picture of this antagonist, however difficult or even hopeless it may be to draw a clear-cut line between authentic information and such variations on the Dantean source as the portrait of Filippo Argenti in Decameron ix, 8. They tell us that he was an overbearing and reckless nobleman of the Neri faction, opposed to Dante's. The nickname Argenti, which superseded the well-known family names of Cavicciuli and Adimari, was suggested by the bumptious ex- travagance which made him shoe his horse with silver instead of iron. Legend and chronicle mix inextricably in the story that he, a hater of his fellow-citizens, had a horse which he called the horse of the Florentine people and which he generously offered for use to each and all who wanted it. Then, of course, he was unable to lend it save to the one who was lucky or brisk enough to appear at the stable first; the others, the late comers, were saluted by the gentleman with insulting laughter. This is, so far, not much of a criminal record, considering circumstances and times. Fits of anger and unpleasant jokes might have been seen more leniently, from the angle of the picturesque, by a judge more easy-going than Dante; and such is the treament to which the Argenti theme was to be subjected in the pas- sage of the Decameron. Dante, however, for his own good reasons, thought that eternal mud was fit retaliation for the insolent flash of those silver hoofs. Filippo, who indeed had been a man on horseback, is dismounted forever; neither does he seem to enjoy the strange privilege by which he, a rather obscure commune- baron, is picked by the poet to herald in sight of Pandemonium the parade of 183</page><page sequence="2">184 The Wrath of Dante Centaurs, monsters, and Titans, who will be overtowered by the stature of Ca- paneo and overcrowed by the blasphemy of Vanni Fucci. II The novelty of the Argenti episode is at least twofold. Structurally, Dante proves able for the first time to handle three persons at once: Argenti, Virgil, and himself. Thus far he had not surpassed the flat or Byzantine technique of straight dialogue between himself and Virgil, or between himself and a shade, or between Virgil and an official of the underworld. Even in the most elaborate episode of the preceding cantos, Virgil acted simply as stage director, introduc- ing the Dante-Francesca dialogue, during which the most pertinent reason for the famed silence of Paolo is the inability of the poet to manage a third person- age. Now, in the eighth canto, it is as if he at one stroke had achieved in his dramatic technique a transition like that from the two-actor to the three-actor performance in Greek tragedy. Together with the other enrichments in land- scape, movement, language, and rhythm, this change implies a profound allot- ropy in the poet's imagination, and points to a gap between the composition of the seventh and of the eighth canto, the extension of which in chronology might be of years or of weeks, but the depth of which bears the significance of a mental conversion, and marks the transition from Dante's youthful style to his poetic maturity, from apprenticeship to masterhood. A partial analogy might be found, e.g., in the transition in painting from golden ground to perspective and chiaroscuro, with all the spiritual values involved in the difference. The change in Dante's style belongs, in fact, to the series of individual and collective phenomena which lead from Mediaeval taste to Renaissance. Psychologically, the Argenti episode offers the first instance of an outburst of violent passion in Dante's heart. Strange as it may seem, the only prelude, so far, to such moods had been ascribed to Virgil, the gentle Sage, when he ad- dressed Pluto: 'Be silent, cursed Wolf!' Dante himself had never dared and the limited range of his emotions had been contained between fear and pity: fear, perhaps, occasionally relieved by such puerile nonchalance as the wanderer's delight at the leopard's gay skin, but usually assuaged by the pupil's no less childlike confidence in Virgil's guidance; pity so conventionalized that Dante's quavering words and flowing tears are the same before the glutton Ciacco as they had been in the presence of Francesca the heroine of love. Both feelings repeatedly stretched to the extreme expression of swooning and falling like a dead body, which however must be taken partly as a mannerism or convention of mediaeval sentimentality rather than as a statement of actual happening. Now, suddenly, a third set of emotions, as red-hot as the city of Dis, breaks the monotony of the long prelude. As the first seven cantos - and not the fifth alone - had been the cantos of pity, so the eighth is the canto of rage. To be sure, si vis me flere flendum est ipsi tibi, which also means that the poet wanting to stage a mad dog like Argenti must inject a quantum of madness into his own brain. The contagion of dramatic passion had been observed at least</page><page sequence="3">The Wrath of Dante 185 as early as Plato, and Dante himself, later in the Inferno, will exclaim with ex- ceptional flippancy, 'In church with saints, and with guzzlers in the tavern.' Yet the eighth canto gives a probably unique instance of such a sweeping as- similation or symbiosis. With a chorus of, rioting devils behind the scene, all four actors of the play build a Laokoontian group under the sign of wrath. That Phlegyas, the infernal boatman, should be as furious as the damned souls, seems rational. Far less intelligible, in the field of rational behavior, is the fact that Virgil, the sweet master, indulges three times successively in the con- demned passion: first when he, thrusting back Argenti, cries, 'Away there with the other dogs!'; second, when he enthusiastically approves Dante's violent heart and promptly grants him the pleasure of contemplating the torture of Argenti; third, when he self-complacently admits that the resistance of the devils at the entrance of the city of Dis has made him 'angry.' Dante, how- ever, tops everybody and everything, while the meekest of all is the supposedly mad dog Argenti. His approach to the passer-by is as beggarly and humble as could be: 'Who art thou? . . . I am one who mourn.' It is Dante's unprovoked insult that maddens him to a miserably impotent threat; whereupon the expia- tion is frightful, and more frightful is Dante's grinning thanksgiving to the justice of God. This savagery is only matched in the nethermost pit of Hell when Dante, a traitor among traitors, thumbs his nose, so to speak, at friar Alberigo whom he has cheated, or when, shortly before, he has actually struck at Bocca degli Abati, pulling some locks of hair from his eternally frozen head. Rightly another inmate of the penitentiary, hearing Bocca's howling and unaware of the travel- ling poet, asks him: 'Who is the devil who is tormenting thee?' III The readers' reactions to the Argenti episode have varied according to their personal tempers. Kind souls have shrunk before the horror; more hardy ones, less numerous, have cheerfully applauded Dante's scorning 'justice.' An historic and poetic interpretation would amount to more than mere favor or disfavor toward Dante's attitude. If Dante had become conscious of his change, if he had tried to justify his al- lotropy with teachings and examples drawn from classical antiquity, he hardly would have found valid support in pagan poetry or philosophy. Juvenal, whom he knew, suggested, rather theoretically, that 'indignatio facit versus'; his in- dignatio, at any rate, was moralizing diatribe, not fury opposed to fury. Greek poetry was to the Christian poet a sealed book; had he been able to open it, he would have realized how constantly for ten centuries or more it deprecated ire and urged moderation and forgiveness. Wrath was occasionally supposed in gods, with a mixture of stupor and awe; it was not allowed to men. This attitude is grounded in the very first foundation of classical culture, the Iliad. Achilles knows the sweetness of wrath, 'far sweeter than trickling honey,' as well as he knows the joy of battle. He also knows, however, that gentleness is the better part, and</page><page sequence="4">186 The Wrath of Dante wishes that strife and wrath may 'perish utterly among gods and men.' The barbaric Iliad is the poem of the Wrath of Achilles, with the poet and Achilles himself against it. The Christian Comedy is, partly at least, the poem of the Wrath of Dante, with the poet for it. The Greek attitude did not change with Virgil and all other Latin poets and moralists. Such fits of temper as occurred in Catullus as well as in Archilochus were openly autobiographical without any attempt at ethical rationalization. Seneca's De Ira, which Dante may have read, is an elaborate, nay, punctilious argument against any justification whatsoever of any kind of anger. This tide, undoubtedly, may surge within a noble soul, battering the dykes of reason. The example to follow in such predicaments is offered by Socrates, who (as though he already had intuited the discoveries of Darwin and James on emotion and ex- pression) when wrath swelled in his breast, lowered his voice and restrained his speech, thus starving the monster. Unbridled anger is barbaric; it belongs, Seneca says, to Germans and Scythians. From these and such other outcasts of culture decadent Romans learned it. If Seneca had known the Jewish God, this thunderer without the Olympian catharsis of the reigning Zeus, he probably would have considered him as the product of a barbaric imagination. This could nowise be the point of view of a mediaeval Christian. Of hypotyposes of the furious God there was no scarcity in the Pentateuch, in the Prophets, in the Psalms, in Job, in nearly all the books of the old Testament; they were to a Christian of those times anything but myths. Had the new Covenant allayed the divine wrath and modified God? Is God modifiable? Cautiously, yet dangerously, Fathers of the Church and doc- tors approached the problem. Lactantius' treatise De ira Dei, the issues of which were exemplified in the same author's De morte persecutorum, is unlikely to have been familiar to Dante. He would have cherished it. Its point is that qui non odit nec diligit; hence the unbreakable tie of love and anger in the loving Christian God, to whom three affections and none more may and must be ascribed, namely, mercy, wrath, and pity. Augustine, more deeply impressed by classical philoso- phy, tried to square the circle by describing an undescribable anger of God, which does not inflame His mind, nor disturb His unchangeable tranquillity. More safely, Aquinas, while stating that 'in willing justice God wills punishment' (Summa, i, Q.19, A.9) shuns the troubling issue of divine anger, too impure, per- haps, for his Pure Being. But cold-minded punishment, or judicial aloofness - let alone the radiant laxity of the imperturbable deity which we shall meet some centuries later in Goethe's Faust - was inadequate to Dante, the most tragic of Christians. By a logic of the heart, which the logic of the mind does not know, the horror of eternal punishment, which orthodoxy forced him to admit, in turn forced him to postulate a proportionate passion of God, whose anger was the lightning of Justice. The tide of violence, first released from the mud of Styx, not only floods the cone of Hell. It besprinkles, and more than that, the slopes of Purga- tory despite all hymns and rites to mansuetude. It mounts to Heaven, where the saints, the blessed, are flushed with unanimous wrath as if - says Dante - the</page><page sequence="5">The Wrath of Dante 187 ruddy planet Mars and the white planet Jove were birds and had changed their feathers (a dazzling absurdity at which Boccaccio and Ariosto were slyly to smile in their caricatures of the angels Gabriel and Michael as boxers and bravoes), until it reaches, invisible but unmistakably present, the throne of God, its alleged source. Not wrath alone, revengefulness is attributed to God, with its delight in fulfillment postponed. 'O my Lord, when shall I rejoice to see thy vengeance, which, hidden, maketh sweet thine anger in thy secret?' True, there is no throne of God in Dante. His God has neither beard nor hand; a Point, the Point, metaphysical and metamathematical, lie is flawlessly above any residue of anthropomorphism. Yet He is strongly anthropopathic, a hopeless contradic- tion, though it is with contradictions that poetry lives or dies, and nothing is peculiar to those of Dante save their magnitude. Whatever, for the rest, he may have thought or felt of God's wrath does not carry any validity of exoneration for Dante's own. The prophets, in behalf of God, had used violence of words rather than of deeds, and against living armed sinners, not against helpless shades of the underworld. As a rule they had been tortured, not torturers. Christ had known at times the urge of indignation, not only when scourging the money-changers. But apart from the superhuman character which any faithful should have acknowledged in His exceptional anger, all the weight of His teaching and doing reposes on meekness and leni- ency. Lactantius, indeed, had granted to men a certain amount of anger, adding the explanation, quite interesting to a modern reader, that this passion, opening a natural, or, as we would say, physiological outlet to the humors of the spleen, cannot be taken as wholly sinful. This concession, however, was made under the restriction that moral anger should never grow inexorable and irreconcilable. The most imperative authorities to whose judgment Dante might have sub- jected the particular quality of his wrath were, as usual, Aristotle in the Nico- machean Ethics, and Aquinas in the Summa. Aristotle, whose assertions in this regard were to be disputed by the radical negation of Seneca, bent somehow from the ordinary course of Greek feeling, also in this field adopting his cher- ished middle way. In respect of anger-the Aristotelian word for which is at any rate 6p'y i and not Achilles's y-vts-(II, 7): 'Here too there is excess, defect, and a mean state; but since they may be said to have really no proper names, as we call the virtuous character meek, we will call the mean state meekness' (Me- diaeval Latin translators more appropriately rendered i7rpaov and 7rpaOTrTa with mansuetus and mansuetudo), 'and of the extremes, let the man who is excessive be denominated Passionate, and the faulty state Passionateness, and him who is deficient Angerless, and the defect Angerlessness.' The passage is expanded in Book iv, 5, where 'the notion represented by the term "meek man" is that of being imperturbable, and not of being led away by passion, but of being angry in that manner, and at those things, and for that length of time, which Reason may direct.' This concept of a reasonable and managed anger, nay, of an anger unperturbed and 'maeek' or at least gentle and calm was developed and system- ized in several passages of Aquinas, especially in Prima Secunda, Q. 46-48 and Secunda Secundae Q. 158. The gist of the discussion is that 'si ... aliquis irasci-</page><page sequence="6">188 The Wrath of Dante tur secundum rationem reetam, tunc irasci est laudabile,' but anger becomes a sin 'si nimis ardenter irascatur interius, vel si nimis exterius manifestet signa irae' and a mortal sin 'in illo casu in quo ira contrariatur charitati.' Clearly enough, neither Aristotle nor Aquinas, had they travelled in Hell, would have behaved with Filippo Argenti or Bocca degli Abati as Dante did. Agreement with the decrees of justice does not imply that he who agrees should add, while visiting a penitentiary, the crack of this extra whip to the punishment of the offenders, nor that he should otherwise volunteer for jobs which pertain to executioners upon the earth and to devils below. Dante's outbursts and violences, rather than under the Thomistic heading of De Iracundia, belong to the follow- ing: De Crudelitate. Obviously enough, there is no ethical or theological level at which his wrath could meet poetic acquittal. IV Glimpses of biographical explanation appear in early commentators. We are told that there had been personal as well as political enmity between Dante and Argenti: a grudge, e.g., which had followed the fine assessed by Dante as a magistrate on the ruthless horseman, who, in his 'hybris,' had madly ridden through the city with legs apart. More surely, we know that a relative or brother of Filippo, Boccaccino degli Adimari, had taken hold of Dante's estate after the latter's exile. This is the information of which a recent interpreter, Giovanni Ferretti, takes most stock. It is at once explanatory and ennobling. By cursing Filippo, Dante wants to warn and intimidate the living brother, thus protecting as best he can his wife and children, whom he has left behind in cruel Florence. We are dealing with a horseman. We are warranted to use an old metaphor of horses and say that, according to the far-fetched hypothesis of this otherwise very stimulating interpreter, Dante is beating the saddle to beat the horse; or, as the Italians put it, he is talking to daughter-in-law in order that mother-in- law may listen. One isolated early commentator suggested that the retortion is more direct. He assumes that once in his earthly life Filippo Argenti had actually slapped Dante in the face. Of course, we shall never find documentary evidence of this commentator's truthfulness or falsehood. A story like this displeases the regular Dante scholar. Dante scholars usually are balanced, dignified, irreprehensible people. They feel as if Dante had been a Dante scholar.1 Such attitude was and is particularly striking in the endless dispute about the tenzone of insults between Dante and Forese Donati, the only stain in the pink and blue idealism of the poet's youth. When it proved impossible to throw away those evil sonnets as apocryphal stuff, Dante scholars ordinarily have clung 1 E.g., Barbi, Studi Danteschi, Ix, p. 130: 'Possibile tanta vilth in un'anima di quella tempra?' Or Zingarelli, Dante, p. 919, apropos of the Argenti episode: 'Chi crede che egli sfogasse una vendetta personale non pub onestamente conciliarlo con la lode di Virgilio, e la serietA del Poeta, che non avrebbe esposto la sua opera, facendola strumento di privati rancori, al sospetto e discredito, e dis- trutto ogni buon effetto'.</page><page sequence="7">The Wrath of Dante 189 to the opinion that they were clear fun, or mere training in the art of writing jocular verse. They were no fun, no joke, as any unbiased reader must directly realize. They staged a real fight, in which Dante was the loser. His charges against Forese sound comparatively weak and vague. Forese's against Dante disclose, indeed, not that Dante was an embezzler and barrator, but how and why it could happen that some years later Dante was sentenced in absentia for embezzlement and barratry, and perhaps also why he was to deal with barrators (Inferno, xxi and xxii) in that particular way, high-spirited, and yet half-consciously self-con- scious. Above all - and this is what is pertinent to our topic - Forese hammers and hammers on Dante's cowardice. They are fighting, but one of the two mercilessly denies the opponent's fighting qualities, should they pass from words to deeds. Not only is Dante accused of neglecting to take revenge for some obscure shame upon his father's and his family's honor; more generally and conclusively he is pilloried as a coward. 'Him who lavishly thrashes thee thou takest for brother and friend.' These are Forese's final words, and we do not know of any Dantean retort. It seems as though he had shrunk back into his private Paradise. Conciliation - of a chivalric sort - comes much later, in the second canticle of the Comedy, when the two, meeting in the light of Eternity, make to each other equally allusive but equally generous apologies. Whether in Dante's youth the propensity to endure abuse and injury was cowardice or piety is no real problem. Orphanhood, poverty, repression, and the insecurity of the rather lonesome declasse living for long years on the margins of Florentine society combined with the radically Christian doctrine of Francis- can humility, turning the other cheek. As there is no reason for trusting blindly the commentator according to whom Filippo Argenti had slapped Dante in the face, there is no sufficient reason either for discarding indignantly whatever proba- bility his statement may contain. Supposing that Dante really endured the out- rage, he may have rationalized - or even justified - his behavior not only with words of Christ, but with the words, more unequivocal, of the Franciscan tradition which crowned as the friar of perfect bliss, of perfetta letizia, him who, left out in the cold, and affronted and struck and dragged in the snow, nevertheless un- beatably beaten, exults in the thought of the cross. At any rate it would be inadequate to mark the difference between the first seven cantos of the Inferno and the Argenti scene as a change from an early attitude in the Divine Comedy to a later one. It is much more than that. An undertow of repressed ire ran before the beginning of the poem, through all the Vita Nuova; Dante, enthralled in visionary meekness, constantly triumphed, a Franciscan lamb, over its suffocated rumble. He did not mind the cruel mockery of the young ladies and of Beatrice herself at the wedding party, he candidly pictured himself as the laughing stock of the Florentine girls, and the strongly pre-Freudian interpretation of his dream in a lewd sonnet of his friend Dante da Maiano proves, together with the sonnets of the other friend Forese, how easy it was to scoff at him and get away with it. 'I say,' he wrote, 'that whenever she [Beatrice] appeared in any place, in the hope of her marvelous salutation there</page><page sequence="8">190 The Wrath of Dante no longer remained to me an enemy; nay, a flame of charity possessed me, which made me pardon every one who had done me wrong; aiid had any one at that time questioned me of anything, my only answer would have been "Love", and my face would have been clothed with humility.' She 'humbleth him till he for- gets all wrong.' 'Anger and pride away before her fly.' Now pride and anger are unmistakably present, to remain, however ably the latter may be surnamed disdain, and together with them, most probably, is revengefulness, of the most personal and passionate kind. Even if it were pos- sible, as it is not, to explain the outburst on the base of Aristotelian or Thomistic ethics, even if it were warranted to apply to the present case St Gregor's or Bishop Butler's eulogies of righteous anger and to reject the unqualified disap- proval uttered by Buddhism or Tolstoyanism, the dubiousness of the moral issue would not curtail by any means the significance of the emotional and poetic change: a real conversion involving the whole of Dante's personality. Whether or how much the conversion impinged on Dante's actual behavior and how deep or superficial is the historic foundation for the legends of Dante furens,l lies beyond the boundaries of our present purpose, and we do know that what Dante did to Argenti or Bocca degli Abati or Frate Alberigo he did not actually do but simply dream. Nevertheless his psychic attitude became thoroughly different, and the pre-Raphaelite poet of the sweet new style, whose work had extended from the early poems to the seventh canto and whose provisory masterpiece had been achieved in the Francesca scene, was superseded by the master of the grand and not seldom violent style, by the one who might be called the 'Michel- angiolesque' Dante (only so to speak, since, as is obvious, elements of this kind came to Michelangelo largely through Dantean imitation), and who was and re- mains the Dantean Dante. In no other artist, before or after Dante, did the release of anger play such a part as in him,2 and this passion appears as a decisive component in the structure of his originality. It is not surprising that, together with the inner proportion of feelings, his poetic taste and technique of expression also underwent a metamorphosis; the primitivist draftsman yielded to the Renaissance painter, with a stupendous increase of realistic color and dramatic power. V The long dispute about the dating of the Divine Comedy seems to be in a hope- less deadlock. The latest contribution, a weighty and brilliant book by Giovanni Ferretti on I due tempi della composizione della Divina Commedia (Bari, 1935),3 1 See them perspicuously collected by Hayward Keniston, The Dante Tradition in the XIF and XV Centuries, in the Report of the Dante Society (Cambridge, Mass., 1915). 2 The example of the 'harsh rhymes' in troubadouric poetry may lie behind such exertions as the Dantean Sordello's invective; but, strictly conventional and oratorical as they are, they hardly offer a significant precedent for a passional upheaval involving all the personality of a great poet. 3He had been preceded by Henri Hauvette, Etudes sur la D.C.: la composition du poe'me et son rayonnement (Paris, 19292), and Hauvette in turn by Costanza Agostini, I1 racconto del Boccaccio e i primi sette canti della Commedia (1908): a forerunner who, like so many others, had passed either un- heeded or minimized. A valuable contribution to the problem of the date is in Luigi Pietrobono, Saggi</page><page sequence="9">The Wrath of Dante 191 was saluted by the leading Dantist Michele Barbil with the most gratifying praises to its scholarship and shrewdness, and in the same breath with the curtest rejection of its conclusions, minimized, despite all toil, as sheer hypotheses. This proves again that the external evidence in this problem is weak and crippled, and as such is bound to remain unless unpredictable miracles happen in unexplored archives. Until that day, it is linguistic, metaphorical, psychological, and aesthetic analysis alone which can supply the internal evidence apt to tip the scales. One instance may be taken from the famed invective to Madonna Pietra (Rime ciii). It starts with the line: 'Cosi nel mio parlar voglio esser aspro.' The similarity of this exordium with the first line of Inferno xxxii, 'S'io avessi le rime aspre e chiocce,' striking as it is, remains unconvincing as long as it remains isolated. But if, reading further in the canzone, we meet the image of the poet violently and wellnigh sadistically catching the tresses of the woman, and reading further in Inferno xxxii we meet the same Dante tearing the locks of hair of Bocca degli Abati, the second coincidence lifts more than geometrically the meaning of the first, and the evidence that the two compositions belong to the same period becomes almost commanding. Analogous results should be yielded by careful tests of the tissue of Dante's poetry. And if the external evidence does not irreparably conflict, the aesthetic- psychological analysis should provide us with probability at a degree approach- ing certitude. VI The problem of the dating of the Divine Comedy is not indeed a trivial one; so deep-going and wide-spread are its implications concerning the biography of a great poet, the meaning of a great monument, the history of an age, and our intelligence - in general - of the poetic process. What has been said about the release of anger in Inferno viii authorizes us, in the learned confusion of a dispute which is aging without maturing, to propose for further investigation the following scheme. It is certain that between the seventh and the eighth canto there is a gap, a stylistic and moral interval, which postulates a decisive crisis of the personality with, most probably, an adequate interruption in time. It is quite possible that the first seven cantos were composed on inspirations, plans, or even sketches and drafts reaching as far back as Dante's Florentine period, or even as far back as the Vita Nuova and 'Donne che avete intelletto d'amore.' It is highly unlikely - and not on account of Ciacco's prophecy alone - that they were written, such as we have them now, in a past so remote. It might seem plausible to place them sometime during the early stage of Henry vii's expedition, when col- laboration with the papacy and a happy political outcome still appeared con- ceivable. This part of the Inferno, extant before 1313, may suffice to explain the Danteschi, (Rome, 1936) 'Sulla data di composizione della D.C.,' pp. 185-220, which essay, however, had been written several years before Ferretti's book. I Studi Danteschi, xix, 172 f.</page><page sequence="10">192 The Wrath of Dante mention of Dante's work in Francesco da Barberino, the so-called Barberinian argument in favor of an early dating of the Comedy. It is little short of absurd to suppose that when Dante wrote his epistle Amico Florentino, in 1315, he had finished the Inferno, nay the Purgatorio. 'Hoene meruit ... sudor et labor continuatus in studio? ... Absit a viro phylosophie domestico ... Nonne dulcissimas veritates potero speculari ubique sub celo?' Even if one grants what must be granted to his terminology and poetics, it is clear, notwithstanding, that in the epistle he speaks rather like a philosopher than a poet, as if the Convivio still were in his opinion his greatest asset. Had he had in hand the thirty-four cantos of the Inferno, nay, the sixty-seven of the two first canticles, the poetic vaunt would hardly have been avoided. It is not absurd to suppose that with the vanishing of the last hope, the Divine Comedy really and at last began. The epistle to the Florentine friend, which shatters all chance of conciliation and return, strikes, for that matter, the same string as the Argenti episode. 'Absit a viro phylosophie domestico temeraria tantum cordis humilitas, ... ut quasi vinctus ipse se patiatur offerri.' This seems to be the announcement of the great wrath. Now, all earthly hope and earthly love spent, with old age and death at his heels, and on the other hand sheltered in more comfortable hospitalities, he could ply his work, in the concentration and continuity without which the inten- sity of the result would be nearly unthinkable. Thirteen hundred thirteen, the year of Henry vii's failure and death, might be one of the optional dates for the end of the Middle Ages, and not the least fitting of all, since thenceforth all planning for the world unity of Church and Empire was to be mere daydream.) In the wake of that catastrophe Dante writes his book, and dies. The Divine Comedy is the swan-song of the Middle Ages. VII Thus, in irretrievable defeat and unbending poetic self-justice, the Argenti episode is the Dantean 'Fluch vor allem der Geduld.' A physician of our time would say, perhaps, that a powerful release of adrenalin has balanced a morbid personality and completed its frame. Not that pity or even morbidity disappear. The old Dante lives forth, but bridled and spurred at once by the new. The Comedy, essentially a tragedy, is made of pity and terror; but Dante, mediaevally extreme, was unable to even the two elements in the continuous harmony of classical poetry. Hence, one excess was counterpoised by the other; utmost humility and tremor by utmost anger and pride, according to the gothic technique, which does not tame the 1 As 1313 seems to be the most significant date for the end of the Middle Ages, 313, the date of the Edict of Milan, which established the world-unity of Empire and Church, might be adopted for their beginning. The Middle Ages would be contained in a span of exactly one thousand years, while the Classical Age from the Trojan War to Constantine the Great would comprise approximately fifteen hundred years, and the third age - or Revival, or Transition, or Era of the Nations - would run for exactly six hundred years, from the failure of Henry VII and the real Hegira of Dante to the eve of the World War. The symmetry of the figures would be countenanced in this case by their appropriate- ness to the decisive features of the epochs concerned.</page><page sequence="11">The Wrath of Dante 193 opposing stresses of the material in the straight line or soothe them in the round arch, but frankly avows them, baring the struggle. The eighth canto itself, half outburst against the damned, half fear of the devils forbidding the entrance to Dis, is perfectly a pointed arch. Pride soars on the wings of wrath. Almost stooping, Dante had said: 'Jo non Enea, io non Paolo sono.' Now suddenly he promotes himself to justiciar and helper of God's wrath: Godlike. His Dies Irae has dawned. Virgil's salutation, borrowed from the Ave Maria: 'blessed be she that bore thee' hints, unaware of sacrilege, at a symbolic equalization of Dante with Christ, and the canto is not closed ere a replica is more than sketched in the scene of the devils defending the gates of Hell against the intruder who, Christ-like, will vanquish them. However dangerous, the allotropy in pride and anger now has lifted Dante to the height of his power. It is no political or sacerdotal power; neither will he rebuild the Empire or reform the Church. But he has acquired the inner freedom in plenitude which we call poetic genius. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.</page></plain_text>
