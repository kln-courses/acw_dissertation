<plain_text><page sequence="1">Robert S. Ellwood NOTES ON A NEOPAGAN RELIGIOUS GROUP IN AMERICA I Within the United States there are a great number of tiny religious groups not in the central Judeo-Christian tradition or based in ethnic minorities such as the Japanese-Americans. They are the product of individual experiences of changed religious conscious- ness by persons within the main American cultural stream. For some three years I have been attempting to survey these small but significant groups. Now I would like to make some general remarks concerning the history and typology of these groups and then illustrate certain operative principles by means of the examination of one in light of Joachim Wach's three categories of religious expression. The problem of the definition of religion immediately arises in a very practical way in investigations of this type, for many of the groups under consideration like to insist they are "not a religion" but merely teachers of certain "metaphysical" truths or practitioners of "scientific" techniques for obtaining expanded mental powers. As a matter of establishing practical guidelines, I have combined Frederick Streng's definition of religion as "means of ultimate transformation" with Joachim Wach's three categories of religious expression (verbal, practical, social).l If a group seems 1 Frederick J.

The question of what constitutes a non-Judeo-Christian religion within the context of American culture must also be faced. From a purely phenomenological point of view, it is generally possible to make working decisions on the grounds of operative teaching, de- gree of historical continuity with the normative Judeo-Christian institutions, and the extent to which the group itself chooses to emphasize symbols of continuity or symbols of discontinuity with the normative tradition in its verbal expression, worship format, and institutional structure. On these grounds it seemed evident that Unitarianism, for example, should be considered in the Judeo-Christian orbit, but that Theosophy should not. The "New Thought" type of church- Christian Science, Religious Science, etc.-and Spiritualism pre- sent more difficult problems. They both offer highly atypical teaching amidst symbols and a worship format obviously intended to reinforce some continuity with American Protestantism. (Partly on grounds of limiting scope, partly on grounds of sociologi- cal and historical role, I decided to exclude the New Thought churches from my study but to include Spiritualism.) After this process of definition, the groups-cults if one wishes to use that term in a sociological sense-which remain form a rather manageable collection. They are many, but fall into certain rather definitive categories and have a large number of common features. First, the theosophical type, based ultimately on the teaching and style of Madame Blavatsky and her followers: The Theosophical societies, the Full-Moon Meditation groups, Anthro- posophy, modern Rosicrucianism, the "I Am" movement, and others. Second, there is the Spiritualist tradition, which has proliferated a number of churches, including, it would seem, the UFO cults, for one finds that most of their founders were close to the Spiritualist tradition and that "space brothers" and "spirit guides" easily become interchangeable. Third, the occult groups- "Hermetic" bodies, Gurdjieff groups, Scientology, etc.-offer initiation into expanded consciousness through a highly structured production of internal experience and impartation of knowledge. Fourth, what may be termed neopagan groups-revivals of ancient religions, witchcraft, ceremonial magic, Satanism-promote a new vision of man's relation to nature, the archetypes of the uncon- 126</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions scious, and the passions. Fifth and finally, there are the numerous Oriental-import groups, from Vedanta to Nichiren Shoshu. What these groups have in common is, basically, an experience of that style of religious communication which Max Weber called "exemplary" and identified mainly with Eastern religion, in contrast to the usual Western "emissary" style. Even more fundamental is a recurrence of the motifs of shamanism in the context of the modern world, perhaps through the type of re- ligious specialist termed the "magus" who may be regarded as a "shaman in civilization." The "exemplary" and shamanistic world views alike presuppose an essentially nonhistorical cosmos in which access to ultimate transformation is obtained through sub- jective initiation and the acquisition of techniques of ecstasy. The central raison d'etre of our cult groups is the ecstatic experience, or the possibility of it, rather than the emissary function of proclaim- ing the word of God and the function which is always the burden of the religious institutions of the majority culture in a society- sanctioning its normative values. Within the context of American society, a cult may be spoken of as a group derived from the experience of one or a few individuals able to enter (or fascinated by the possibility of entering) a superior, ecstatic state of conscious- ness in which contact and rapport with all reaches of a non- historical and transpersonal universe is possible with the help of intermediates (human or superhuman), and in which an outer circle of members experiences the presence of the sacred in these ecstatic individuals and seeks to participate in their experience. All of the groups in the above list, which virtually exhausts the roster of nonethnic, non-Judeo-Christian religious groups in America, seem basically to fit into this characterization. In other words, there seems to be no religious public in America other than those whose needs are met by Jewish synagogues and Christian churches, except those who frequent cults of this type, even though one could think of other theoretical possibilities.2 The cults have, then, more in common than a negative reaction against the Judeo-Christian tradition. They focus around a par- ticular, different experience of the sacred: it is found in the 2 One partial exception is the Krishna Consciousness movement, which func- tionally believes that its high god, Krishna, is both personal and impersonal. The Black Muslims, who show characteristics of both a cult and a sect, being cultic in- sofar as they are non-Judeo-Christian, sectarian insofar as they adopt a prophetic, "emissary," historical process instead of internal ecstasy or the peak experience as the religious goal, are another. Their extreme alienation has forced them into a stance atypical of the dynamics of group symbolism in America. 127</page><page sequence="4">A Neopagan Religious Group ecstatic experience. This experience for them is always set against the background of a nontemporal and nonhistorical cosmos. And the space intervening between the devotee and the ultimate is always peopled with semidivine helpers-Masters, spirit guides, UFO occupants, revived pagan gods, or the saints, Buddhas, and gods of the East. The Absolute is less personal than for the nor- mative Western tradition; the void between far more so. The spokesman for this new sacred cosmos is not the emissary prophet, acting as by proxy on behalf of God, but the shamanistic ecstatic, subjectively continuous with the sacred. These groups share with shamanism not only the general typology of the charismatic seer, but to a remarkable extent details of the pattern, including the spirit band, subjective initiation, learned or spontaneous ritual, antihistoricism, the bringing of wisdom from far away geographi- cal or supernatural places, healing power, and above all the teach- ing of techniques of ecstasy. A few specific characteristics of the cults are: 1. Charismatic founding based on transtemporal ecstatic ex- perience. 2. An interpretation of the experience as possession or marvelous travel. These familiar motifs of archaic shamanism are strikingly renewed in Spiritualism and UFO cults and less obviously perhaps in the symbolism of interior mystical exploration and the bringing of lore from the far-away Orient. 3. A band of supernormal helpers. Again, in Spiritualism, there is a literal re-creation of this shamanistic motif, and scarcely less so in the Theosophical "Masters" and the UFO "space brothers," in the spirits evoked by witchcraft and ceremonial magic, and the gods and goddesses of neopaganism. If the psychological meaning of this phenomenon is the subduing of uncontrolled fragments of the psyche, it bespeaks the emphasis on the understanding and control of subjectivity typical of the whole movement. Its equivalent can be found in other cultic groups which prefer not to use such mythological modes of expression. 4. Eclecticism and syncretism. 5. A monistic and impersonal ontology. 6. Emphasis on healing. 7. Use in many cases of magic techniques. 8. A simple but definite process of entry and initiation. 9. An optimistic and evolutionary view of the future. 10. Emphasis on psychic powers. 128</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions 11. Tendency to attract isolated individuals rather than family groups. These motifs are characteristic of a tradition which has pre- sented the West with an alternative to the Judeo-Christian at least since Hellenistic times. Theurgic Neoplatonism is its funda- mental ideological undergirding. Based on a monistic and initiatory cosmos, this alternative tradition can doubtless be traced back to the Orphic and Asian shamanistic experience (Pythagoras, Abaris, Aristeas) which lies behind the Platonic type of philosophy.3 Most of the "new religions" in America, with the exception of the Oriental-import type which arrives at the same thing with a different symbol-system, depend heavily upon this Neoplatonist-Kabbalis- tic-Renaissance alternative tradition. The recent history of these groups in America indicates three basic stages. During the nineteenth century and up until the First World War, the dominant groups-Spiritualism, Theosophy, New Thought, and even magical groups like the famous Order of the Golden Dawn-were oriented chiefly around verbal expression, vicarious participation in the ecstatic experience of a central charismatic figure, and affirming some symbols of continuity with Protestant or Catholic Christianity. There were many books to read, lectures to attend, classes to take; spiritual reward was de- ferred until oceans of verbal communication had been swum. As with the shaman of old, transcendent ecstasy was chiefly a "dis- play" performance by a medium, master, or magician. The liturgy was Protestant in format, or else a Liberal Catholic or "Egyptian" Mass. Even Oriental-import groups like the Vedanta Society felt constrained to adapt a type of Sunday morning service quite unknown to Hinduism in India. In the second period, the two decades between the Wars, we see a partial disintegration of the prewar groups through the formation of numerous splinters based on the fundamental premises of the older schools but actually centered around new charismatic per- sonalities, to be near whom was to have some sort of immediate participation in the mystery they represented. Theosophy felt the Krishnamurti enthusiasm. There was Alice Bailey's schism from Theosophy, the Ballards' "I Am" movement, Aleister Crowley's schism from the Golden Dawn, Swami Yogananda's Self-Realiza- tion Fellowship, and others. 3 See Eliza M. Butler, The Myth of the Magis (New York: Macmillan Co., 1948); and E. R. Dodds, Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley: University of Cali- fornia Press, 1951), for valuable (liscussion of this tradition and its origins. 129</page><page sequence="6">A Neopagan Religious Group Since the Second World War, and especially since the rise of the new youth culture of the sixties, major new trends have appeared. We have seen a reaction against deferred reward, verbal communi- cation, and symbols of continuity with the American religious past. While older groups from both previous periods still linger quite unchanged, most newer movements have emphasized the immediate availability of mystical or initiatory experience to all, the exemplary role of the leader ("guru") as catalyst able to "turn on" followers rather than verbalizing teacher, and the use of multisensory communication (sound, light, incense, participatory ritual such as dance). The newer Oriental imports, like Zen and Krishna Consciousness, have stressed, far more than adaptation, the strict observance of the "old country" manner of practicing the religion-down to details of language, dress, and diet-and their alienated adherents have seized with alacrity upon this opportunity to gain a culture as well as a faith. Now it seems that a fourth phase may be just beginning to emerge. The new religions of the sixties-Transcendental Medita- tion, Nichiren Shoshu, Scientology, etc.-were essentially directed toward attaining an inner mantram or "peak experience," an interiorized sacred power which gave the person freedom in the world or even magical energy. Prompted by the psychedelic ex- plosion, the vogue was for the exploration and conquest of "inner space." But the seventies are opening with the new inner cosmos projected outward toward the identification of it with the environ- ment of the religious person. There is a new desire to make sacred space and time in the outer world. In the world of Oriental-import religions, the trend seems to favor a growth of interest in Tibetan Buddhism with its elaborate rituals centering on evocation of the yidam or patronal deity.4 On the side of the Western tradition, ceremonial magic, so-called witchcraft, and forms of neopaganism, also centered on making a ritual cosmos and calling up a deity in the midst of it, are making headway. Perhaps, in the next decade, Vajrayana and magic will be what Zen and other kinds of meditation were in the last. The implications of this "new wave," if it really takes hold, are mani- fold and will probably be much discussed in due course. They would have to include a shift from inner- to outer-directed mentalism, a 4 For a most perceptive discussion of the growth of Tibetan religious centers in the West and their meaning and of the current enthusiasm for Eastern religion and occultism in general, see Jacob Needleman. The New Religions (New York: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1970). 130</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions new assault on the battered world view of Western science, and a new affirmation of the power of imaginative and emotional energy. They represent a growing confidence (or one might argue despera- tion) on the part of the spiritual counterculture. Not content to create a place of inward invincibility, it now strives to reach out to construct its own universe, replete with gods and demons and alternative laws, in which the man of anagogic imagination can find a wide home. The use of the term "imagination" is deliberate, for it is much used by persons in these movements. Two considerations have led to the formations of neopagan groups like the one we shall examine: a desire for a recovery of cosmic religion, oriented not to the tides of history but of nature-the four directions, the seasons, the path of the sun, and the timeless configurations of the psyche-and to the power of imagination in the sense of the power of evocation, of calling up the gods from within the self to the point of their being felt, seen, and touched. We are told that magical evocation is propelled by unleashing the forces touched by one's childhood wonder at sunsets, and fairy tales, and dreams; forces too much pent up in the modern adult. These are the powers called "anago- gic" by Herbert Silberer,5 a term later used by C. G. Jung. These neopagan groups have in common a particular emphasis on the second of the three forms of religious expression, the "practi- cal"-rite, gesture, ceremonial act. It is through corporate "work" that the magical cosmos is evoked; it is "made" by ritual actions that demarcate and celebrate it and by acts done as if it were present. These groups clearly have roots in romanticism as well as Neo- platonism. It would be possible to overemphasize their newness, for they had parallels in Great Britain during the heyday of the Golden Dawn and in Germany during the Weimar Republic period. But the cultural forces at work are not entirely comparable, and different settings create different phenomena and different possible interpretations. Neopagan groups include ceremonial magic orders, Druidic groups, the Church of All Worlds (based on Robert Heinlein's novel, Stranger in a Strange Land), and groups honoring and evoking the Egyptian and Greek pantheons. Their world is closely allied to that of vegetarianism, utopian communes, and nudism. 5 Problems of Mysticism and Its Symbolism (New York: Moffat, Yard &amp; Co., 1917). 131</page><page sequence="8">A Neopagan Religious Group II A serious, though as yet very small, movement of the neopagan type is Feraferia, now centered in Pasadena, California. It rep- resents well the role of founder; history; and the balance of verbal, practical, and social expression, with a characteristic emphasis on practical, in the sense of cultic, expression. Characteristically, the social group is small and rather unstable, except for a tiny nucleus, and the teaching is vast in extent, imitative of myth, and only now undergoing systematization. But the cultic expression is intentionally the glory of the group-more than anything else, it is a ritual experience; the experience of entering a ritually created sacred cosmos, a total milieu. The founder of Feraferia is Frederick Adams. Feraferia was in- corporated August 2, 1967 but the organization had predecessors and is the fruit of a long string of events. The founder, who is now in his forties, was raised in the Altadena area north of Los Angeles and spent a large part of his youth exploring the moun- tains in the region. He graduated from the University of Southern California and studied Celtic and Greek folklore, in particular. He was much influenced by the works of Carl Jung, Carl Kerenyi, Mircea Eliade, Robert Graves, J. J. Bachofen, and Henry Bailey Stevens.6 He states that in the spring of 1956, while he was walking across the campus of Los Angeles City College (where he had been doing graduate work in fine arts and anthropology), he was seized by an experience of the "mysterious feminine." He suddenly realized that "the feminine is a priori." The experience was not quite visual, yet it was a real confrontation, he states, with "mysterium tremendum," with a presence, almost a form, outside himself. He was dazed, and walked about in circles for about ten minutes, muttering "This is it.... She is it." All that he had been reading, and meditating upon in an inchoate, unresolved way, suddenly fell into place. From then on Adams has devoted himself wholly- apart from the necessities of life-to the service of the Feminine Sacred. Between 1957 and 1959 he lived in a multifamily commune in 6 Henry Bailey Stevens, The Recovery of Culture (New York: Harper Bros., 1953), is not as well known as the works of the other writers cited. But it has had a deep influence on Feraferia and other nature utopians. Stevens, an ardent vege- tarian, argues that man was first a tender of trees; that there was a horticultural era before the "fall" into hunting and the subsequent sacrifice-linked agricultural era. This early horticultural paradise is symbolized in myth by such names as Hesperides, Avalon, etc. 132</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions the Sierra Madre Mountains with a group interested in the same ideals. They established an open-air temple to the "Maiden God- dess of Wildness." Already the pedomorphic representation of the goddess, to become so important in Feraferia, was taking shape. The group practiced nudism, as Feraferia does today, on festal and other occasions. The major festivals were the solstices and equinoxes. A publication was issued called Hesperian Life. The ideal of the horticultural society, advocated by Stevens and sym- bolized by the orchard of the Hesperides, was a central image. On some occasions psychedelic drugs (then legal) were used and the experiences all recorded in the journal the group kept. In 1960-61 Adams withdrew to work on a manuscript, Toward an Ethnology of Hesperides. He traveled in Europe to visit the sites of pre- Christian culti, and performed private celebrations at them, also making contact with British neopagan groups. In 1967 the name Feraferia ("nature celebration") came to him in a flash, as though something remembered, as did the group's symbol, the "stang," a trident with sun and crescent moon super- imposed. At the vernal equinox of 1967, the new group's banner was unfurled for the first time at a great "love-in" in Los Angeles's Elysian Park. The basic concept of Feraferia was now virtually complete, and was presented symbolically in a collection of paint- ings and poems published by Adams the same fall, Nine Royal Passions of the Year.7 Feraferia believes that religious life is closely linked with sensi- tivity to nature and one's own erotic awareness. Man, the earth, sky, and sea are one huge biome, or living organism. One is whole only insofar as one recognizes this unity and lives to celebrate it. The pagans were aware of this fact and symbolized it in Kore, the divine maiden of the Greeks, Kore represents all aspects of the feminine, mother and daughter; she is alike Demeter and Perse- phone. She is a divine being who is reborn every year, and the Feraferia calendar, based on Robert Graves's "tree calendar," is basically a celebration of her progress through the year; her birth with the divine lord, Kouros, in early spring; her emergence from childhood; her nuptials; her retiring beneath the earth in winter. This is Kore, the "magic maiden," whose supreme archetypal form, Frederick Adams maintains, is not the "Great Mother" but the pubescent maiden, for the heart of nature is not merely nourishing and life bearing, but also erotic, flirtatious, arousing of passion. 7 Los Angeles: Elysium, Inc., 1967. 6 133</page><page sequence="10">A Neopagan Religious Group To inform the dawning Eco-Psychic Age of Aquarius, wherein celebra- tion will determine subsistence, a long repressed image of divinity is re-emerging: the Merry Maiden, Madimi, Rima, Alice in Wonderland, Princess Ozma, Julia, Lolita, Candy, Zazie of the Metro, Brigitte, Barbarella, and Windy-a grotesque and incongruous assembly at first sight-are all early harbingers of the Heavenly Nymphet. She alone may negotiate free inter-action between the other three anthropomorphic divinities of the Holy Family. These are the Great Mother, Who dominated the Old and New Stone Ages; the Great Father, Who initiated the Early Patriarchal Era; and the Son, Who crystalized the megalopolitan mentality of the Late Patriarchal Era. It is the Dainty Daughter of the Silver Crescent Who will transmute the saturate works of Father and Son to wholeness in the Mater- nal Ground of Existence, without sacrificing the valid achievements of masculine articulation. And She accomplishes this without a crippling imposition of parental or heroic authority images. How delightful to behold Her tease and tickle Father and Son into respectably natural, Life- affirming pagan Gods again. The character of the KORE SOTEIRA, or Holy Maiden Savioress, is hard to delineate precisely because it portends the pararational and permits incommensurables to interfuse without violence at last. The Antic Covenant of the Magic Maiden is radically permissive.8 Moreover the feminine is to Adams a more fundamental arche- type than the masculine, though paradoxically they are also equal. The nature of the masculine is to penetrate, separate, and analyze; that of the feminine is to unite. Therefore without impairing the essence of either, the feminine-Kore-is also the mythical symbol for the unity of all things. Much is said of the harm man has done to himself and to nature by the exaltation of the masculine arche- type, good in itself, to highest place. A visitor to Adams's home in Pasadena is made immediately aware that this is no ordinary suburban house. The front porch is full of signs and symbols from out of the misty past-wreaths, crossed sticks, painted stones. In the backyard trees have been planted and named, and there is a henge-a circle of nine forked sticks oriented to the pole star and the rising sun, like Stonehenge. In the mountains to the north, the group has a larger henge. Within, the house contains shrines to the sun and moon and a room whose floor is a large wheel with all the days of the year marked around it. Stones on it representing the planets are moved to correspond with their position each passing day and season. Here, the important news is not that which comes in the paper, but what nature is doing. Polytheism, which Paul Tillich once remarked is a matter not of quantity but of quality, is not inconsistent with the cultus of the "Magic Maiden." Its whole mood favors an open- ness to the coequal spirituality of each particular of time and 8 Frederick Adams, The Kore, ? Feraferia, Inc., 1969. 134</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions place. The now-voluminous writings of Adams in his monthly periodical, Korythalia, frequently evoke this feeling with poetic power. There is much disparagement of one-pointedness, whether of heroics or asceticism or abstract intellectualism, and much dis- cussion of the unique beauty of each season, weather, tree, moun- tain, mood; under the aegis of the imagination (the surest guide man has to what is at the heart of things without) this flavor be- comes best expressed by polytheism. This is evident in the celebration of the spring seasonal festival, Beltane.9 At the beginning, male and female participants, nude, line up in separate files facing the gates of the henge. The leader, holding a torch, faces west and chants: "Moon Door, Moon Door, Door of Alder, bound with Willow, open now, revealing night, and fiery stars, and silver moon, and demiurgic dark." Then, facing east: "Sun Door, Sun Door, Oaken Door, bedecked with holly, open now, revealing day, and azure airs, and golden sun, and archetypal light." One by one the participants enter the circle of unhewn tree- trunks, sensing it obviously as a sacred place. They make a slow circle clockwise around it within and gather at the east upright. It is made an altar; incense is lit on it; arms are raised in invoca- tion: "Antheides and the Great Fays of the East, Dawn, and Spring, join us now in the Faerie Ring between Worlds. Through the portal between Moon and Sun, return into your Earth Abodes from the far Faerieland of Stars." Other prayers and invocations are offered, such as: "Oh Holy Maiden of the kindling quick of merging mist and mazing echo: The Innocent Bounty of the trees bares 9 The Feraferian seasonal cycle is generally derived from the Celtic, although otherwise the group has been moving more and more in a Greek direction. The nine seasons represented by the nine pillars in the henge are: (1) OSTARA-EAST: The birth of the divine male/female pair, Kouros and Kore. (2) BELTANE-SOUTH- EAST: The emergence of the Divine Maiden and the Kouros from childhood; pubescence and engagement. (3) MIDSUMMER-SOUTH: The embrace of Kore and Kouros in the spirit of ripening love; marriage and coitus. (4) LUGNASAD SOUTHWEST: The congression in love of Kore and Kouros, revealing the Kore as a whole. (5) HARVEST HOME-WEST: Honeymoon; Kore blossoms in the earth landscape; reaping of the Harvest. (6) SAMHAIN NORTHWEST: The Kore becomes sleepy and prepares to retire; the end of the harvest. (7) REPOSE-THE CENTER: The Kore retreats beneath the earth, where all cosmic energy gathers, hidden from sight. The entire universe in a state of rest. (8) YULE-NORTH: All life forces are gathered beneath the earth, converging inside the body of Kore. The life forces of the universe are thus impregnated in her body. (9) OIMLEC-NORTHEAST: The end of gestation; another divine Kore/Kouros pair is ready for birth. The seeds be- neath the earth crack and begin to grope for the surface. 135</page><page sequence="12">A Neopagan Religious Group your Faerie Flesh of Wildness, Wonder, Magic, Mirth, and Love. ... Your beauty seals our bridal with all Life. The dance of your green pulse unfolds all bodies from earth's fragrant form. Evoe Kore!" Then within the ring the group structure somewhat dissolves; members sing, dance, and meditate individually. After about half an hour they circle clockwise again, the gates of the Other World are solemnly closed, they embrace mildly, and leave. Usually a communal meal follows. Another popular rite is a tree-planting ceremony, which can be performed anytime. Formal initiation into Feraferia and its vision are only now in the process of being devised, but have been performed a few times and will be more in the future. They will follow Feraferia's inter- pretation of the Eleusinian and Minoan mysteries. The structure is as follows: 1. A "whole earth evocation"-an evocation of all the biomes of earth to the periphery of the henge. These are twenty-two in number, and include the "archetypal landscapes" of earth (forest, arctic, swamps, etc.) and the principle astronomical bodies in the environment of earth. They are envisioned as anthropomorphic or feramorphic. They constitute, in polytheistic fashion, a "mesocos- mos," for Feraferia holds there is not only a macrocosmos and microcosmos, but also the mesocosmos of the terrestial gods. 2. These visitors are now invoked to the center of the henge, where they mystically form the body of the Magic Maiden, as it were becoming her physiological system. 3. The initiate then seeks to identify the parts of his own body with the respective parts of the mesocosmos and macrocosmos- his airs, fibers, blood, etc., with the respective part of the eco- system through its deity. He does this by uttering sounds, com- binations of vowels and consonants, which capture the energy of that aspect of the Magic Maiden. 4. There is then ecstatic dancing. Individuals may take a pledge to Kore. The purpose of the rite, clearly, is to identify oneself within the total life system. The individual is a sacred unique particular within a universal process having both biological and psychic constituents on all levels. This initiatory attainment of a special universal vision is evidenced by the claim Feraferians make that through this mystery one attains mnemosyne, full remembrance, 136</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions of one's present total interactions with the cosmos, most of which are invisible, and also of one's past incarnations. On attains, in other words, union with all levels of life and being. He is able to move freely, through the power of anagogic imagina- tion, through all parts of cosmic reality. Feraferians emphasize this does not mean exactly an ascensus, for polytheistic experience does not lead one to think of higher and lower, or lesser and greater. It leads one rather to identify the whole with the parts, and the parts with the whole (Kore). It finds the sacred in the particular as much as the totality, and in one level of consciousness as much as another. Feraferian art, often quite beautiful, is generally sur- realistic, reflecting the sacred places of dream and vision. The henge, their mandala, is like a "geography of Tartarus and the Elysian Fields." The membership of Feraferia, about twenty, is mostly middle- aged. But Frederick Adams himself has a smooth, sparkling face and a light, elvish manner which makes him seem much younger than he is. The serious members are typically people who have been involved in pacifist, ecological, and utopian movements. They seem in Feraferia to find a religious expression adequate to what has long been their real spiritual concern. As we have seen, Feraferia is by no means just an outgrowth of the "hippie" move- ment but predates it and has outlasted its peak. But it obviously has been deeply affected by the fact that the "hippies" made some parallel discoveries. Adams's exercise of the leadership role has illustrated the prob- lems inherent in this vocation. The vision is preeminently his, and he has himself done most of the writing, created most of the art, and devised most of the rites. In some ways he approaches re- ligious genius, and undoubtedly without his labors the movement would not exist. It is essentially a circle around a charismatic leader and has no real structure otherwise. It is not clear whether at this point it has any potential to survive him as a sociological entity. Yet there are those who feel that his personality stifles the creativity of others in the evolution of Feraferia, albeit he is a mild and winsome person whom all love and revere. Some feel his vision is so personal and intricate it does not communicate as easily as it should. Some have been through Feraferia and left to establish their own henges and forms of neopaganism, though no offshoots have yet attained real structure. The almost infinite pos- sibilities inherent in neopaganism suggest both that the role of a strong leader with a unifying vision, such as Adams, would be 137</page><page sequence="14">A Neopagan Religious Group necessary to make it viable, and also that the centrifugal forces inescapable in the nature of things may make his task very thank- less. In American society such a cause will attract highly alienated people who are naturally individualistic. The basic problem, of course, is that one is drawing upon forms and symbols charac- teristic of an integral, cosmic religion culture, and attempting to apply them in a situation where such religion can only be an in- tensely personal matter. Feraferia sees itself as a precursor of a future culture in which the feminine archetype will again be restored-in Magic Maiden form-to religious centrality, and in which mankind will recover a sense of reverence in his dealings with nature and life. Indeed, the movement is not entirely seen as nostalgic or reactionary, for it is recognized there are many aspects of archaic pagan culture it does not desire to revive, and that the concept of a primal horti- cultural paradise is something of a valuable myth. It speaks more of "transformation" than of recovery. Its intermediate goal, assuming that culture is in a state of accelerated evolution, is to provide symbols and experience which may make an impact on its movement. Feraferians believe that human society must move in something like its direction or perish. There is talk among some Feraferians of the establishment of a "Paradisal Community," a commune in which the whole manner of life envisioned by the Feraferia experience could be actualized. It would probably be horticultural, vegetarian, and in all ways-work, play, celebration -live close to nature and its shifting moods, preserving trees, wild- ness, and all things unstained through reverent ecology. Unfortunately, the past history of such communes in America, like the history of cult movements, does not suggest optimism about the long-term institutional future of either the commune or Feraferia. The latter has yet to confront the crisis of the second generation. In itself this does not negate the importance of the Feraferia experience. In a period of rapid transition in religious symbols, we cannot say definitively what is merely eccentric and what may represent, even if in grotesque foetal form, the shape of the mystic future.
