<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reluctant Ecology in Blake and Arendt: A Response to Robert Mitchell and Richard Sha Amanda Jo Goldstein Cornell University "The earth," Hannah Arendt writes in her "Pro logue" to The Human Condition, "is the very quintes sence of the human condition, and earthly nature, for all we know, may be unique in the universe in providing human beings with a habitat in which they can move and breathe without effort and without ar tifice" (2).1 The earth is the first, paradigmatic in stance of the given in the book, and repudiating the repudiation of this "free gift from nowhere," requi site to any theory and action that deserve the name, may be Arendt's first and last critical commitment in the work. Still, the status of the earth is by no means the main focus or high aim of The Human Condition, which culminates in nothing less than a theory of political freedom and the conditions under which it might be realized: the luminous sphere of the polis in which persons visibly enact their collective story in words and deeds, itself dependent upon the fabricated world through which they relate to one another with some degree of permanence. Both spheres are extricated at high cost over the course of the text from the earth, which connotes "the circu lar movement of biological life" and every undigni fied opposite of freedom (19). The fate of the earth, dubious in the Cold War, Space Age situation "against whose background this book was written" impinges on the Prologue and the final chapter of The Human Condition like a sorrowful slightly incred ulous concession, not an aspiration (6). Of Arendt's reconstructed image of ancient po litical freedom in the sphere of the polis, one could very exactly say: "they conversed together in Vision ary forms dramatic which bright / Redounded from their Tongues in thunderous majesty" (Blake, Jerusa lem 98.28-29). Like the high-impact, dramatic ex pressions of redeemed Humanity at the climax of William Blake's Jerusalem, that is, Arendt envisions "action and speech as sheer actuality," proper to humans in their plural capacity for spontaneous be ginning and incalculable consequence, effects un predictably "Redound [ing]" (Arendt 207). Agents unloose their speech-acts among and before each other under conditions of hyper-visibility - "reflect ing each in &amp; clearly seen / And seeing" - in per formances of freedom, both authors insist, that are "humanly disclosed by the word" (Arendt 179; Blake J 98.39). "[E]very word &amp; Every Character / Was Human," says Blake, productive of "exemplars of Memory and of Intellect": words and deeds by which "the best" of the species, in Arendt's terms, "attain an immortality of their own," proving themselves to be "really human" against the cycle of procreation and perishing to which they are bound by "biologi cal life" (Arendt 19, Blake J 99.3). In The Human Condition, no less than in Jerusa lem, this polis and its freedoms are carved out in sys tematic opposition "from all the Earth, from the Living Creatures of the Earth," the dominion of ne cessity, mortality, futility, cyclicity, biological survival and bodily need (Blake J98.54). Arendt's regret that among moderns "the activities connected with sheer survival are permitted to appear in public," rather than decently hidden in the private sphere of the household, is palpable (46). How is it that Arendt concedes her Prologue to a stirring defense of the terrestrial condition, allowing the matter of "earthly nature," which defines "the private sphere" for the bulk of The Human Condition, to appear in public, as it were, as "a political question of the first order"? Or that Blake's first Songs of Experience stage an analo gous struggle over whether Earth can or ought to appear when called?2 In this essay, I respond to Robert Mitchell's and Richard Sha's searching inquiries into the risks and promises of Romantic (ist) enthusiasm for "the experience of the experiment" by exploring the sur prising commitment to addressing the Earth in Ar endt and Blake, two punishing critics of experimentalism who would otherwise seem to con verge, if at all, in their undisguised (not to say unro mantic) contempt for Nature.3 In "Romanticism and the Experience of Experiment," Mitchell sum mons The Human Condition to build a compelling case for Romantic artistic experimentation as an at tempt to re-tether humans to an experience of non human given-ness that language keeps common and credible even after the given in Arendt's large sense - "the sensually given world" in its commonly ap pearing reality - had lost all credibility (15). Here I follow Mitchell's luminous lead in discerning, in Ro mantic experimentalism, the maintenance of a cer tain critical non-modernity that The Human Condition throws into striking relief.4 Mitchell out lines a form of Romantic experimentation that re sponds to the loss of the given earth and world by tethering itself to alternative grounds and aims: common language rather than common reality, sub jective reflection rather than knowledge, criteria of happiness rather than of logic. I seek to comple 143</page><page sequence="2">ment this account by sketching another experimen tal attitude that resists the premise that the given has ceased to be given and continues to solicit and regis ter its disclosure, including in the big and basic sense of the earth.5 This eventually brings me to Blake and Ar endt's marginal but insistent admissions to being earthbound, a notion that recurs, in a different mood, in Bruno Latour and Jane Bennett's attempts to formulate anthropocene agency.6 Both tethered to earth and headed toward it in attitudes of tactical, anachronistic geo-centrism, Blake and Arendt, in their earth-bound moments, resist the techno-uto pian "desire to escape from imprisonment to the earth" (which desire, by Arendtian lights, also un derwrites attempts to save the earth by what are in fact unearthly, earth-endangering means) (2-3, 262). Yet the form of reluctant terrestrial commit ment Blake and Arendt share differs from more fa miliar, ecophilic tendencies, both Romantic and scientific, to exalt the earth, decry its loss, and seek its return or restoration under the same aspect as before - indeed, as an exemplar of regularity and quotidian return - no longer recognizable in the wildly variable aspect commonly nicknamed "global weirding."7 Being admittedly earthbound in Blake and Arendt's reluctant sense, I suggest, diverges from these alternatives by considering the earth not as an extrinsic object of knowledge and desire, but as their insurmountable prerequisite and situation: affirming attachment to "the Spaces called Earth" as the ineluctable condition for knowing anything that is not self, these critics are also bound to admit to partaking bodily in, without exhausting, the reality they wish to know (Blake Milton, 29.14).8 Understanding this possibility requires revisit ing "Baconian" experimentalism, but also con fronting the real cruelties of its legacy that Richard Sha forcefully recovers in his contribution to this conversation, "Brainless and Cruel Experiment: The Otherness of Romantic Science." I address the lat ter first, turning briefly to Goethe's "tender empiri cism" because it so succinctly proves the possibility of a canny, revisionary Romantic experimental method that detects and transforms to the root the two inadvertently violent experimentalist premises Arendt also singles out: the illusion of detached ob servation and the mistrust of the world as it ap pears.9 I then take a step back, summoning Raymond Williams's semantic history of the (once synonymous) terms "experience" and "experiment" and Joanna Picciotto's brilliant recent account of reformation experimentalism to nuance the Arend tian image of the new science. Blake and the bogey man Bacon may share a critique of sensory self evidence that operates for the sake of, rather than at the expense of, earthly attachment, directing its skeptical animus onto the sensorium of the observer precisely so as not to relinquish the perceptible world for lost. But in a way that I can limn only briefly, I also hazard the improbable suggestion that Goethe and Blake stake out an awkward feminist dif ference from their experimentalist predecessors on the question of the desire to know. Attempting openly to acknowledge and to soften, rather than deny or eliminate, the dynamics of power and desire at work in experimental curiosity, they rehabilitate bodily desire not only as scientific reason's well known dialectical counterpart, but also as the ef feminized and suppressed motive of experimental curiosity that, risking affection for and by the objects of perception, attachment to and by them, secretly keeps knowledge vulnerable to the liability of know ing otherwise. For "man cannot know / What passes in his members," Blake writes of the source and sub ject of experimental-poetic visions he casts as a mode of bodily revelation: "more extensive / Than any other earthly things, are Mans earthly linea ments" (M 29.9-11). So I close by returning, through these "earthly lineaments," to Earth.] Mitchell and Sha's papers converge in self-im plicating examinations of the ethical lapses, ironic reversals, and strange bedfellows Romanticists might make and take in turning toward the sciences and the signal innovation in method, the experiment, that drove the emergence of a self-consciously New Science across the turn of the 17th century. Against ongoing, prestigious associations with artistic vanguardism and scientific innovation, Sha's essay levies the word "experiment" as the term of abuse it could sometimes be in the Romantic period: a dirty sounding word - actually and frequently modified by "dirty," not to mention "brainless," and "vulgar" and "cruel" - connoting the manual, menial knife work that at best preceded and at worst precluded higher-order knowledge in a scientific culture that valued transcendental, theoretical, and speculative thinking just as much as Romantic literature has long been known to do (Sha 6). Recalling those scholars who celebrate scientific allusions such as Wordsworth and Coleridge's lyrical "experiments," Sha contends they have "ignored this vulgar history" in an oversight that is not innocent: their broadly materialist commitment to telling histories of "prac tice" stands to lose its critical edge on contact with a Romantic science at home in transcendence, quite scornful of experimental practice, and quite ready to construe "experiment" in decidedly immaterial and impractical ways (1, 12-13). 144</page><page sequence="3">While I think materialist methods are fre quently enlivened, rather than undone, by friction with their subjects' self-understandings, casting "ex periment" as an aspersion reactivates an important, polemical thread within a multifarious semantic complex, and Sha's essay has the immense value of making audible a number of cognitive dissonances in Romantic enthusiasm for literature and science.10 To choose the one most resonant with Mitchell's contribution: "experimental" circulates as a term of artistic praise even as the "Baconian science" from which it presumably derives still circulates as a term of abuse. And if Sha challenges enthusiasts to con front the gruesome details and vulgar historical rep utation of Romantic experimentalism, Mitchell puts them to the test of the monumental critiques of Western scientific modernity that taught humanists the very meaning of critique by way of unmasking instrumental reason's covert will to mastery over na tures and cultures cast as non-human. Does Roman tic experimentalism, Mitchell asks, stand guilty by association with the Baconian, or does it offer a way out from a project ultimately devoted only to "gain ing mastery over terrestrial and cosmic forces" (4)? Together, Mitchell and Sha broach fundamental questions about whether valorizing experimental sci ence where it surfaces among the texts, themes, and methods of Romantic studies jeopardizes the multi valent critique of Enlightenment that motivates the historical appearances and critical afterlives of Romanticism. The most direct response to the specific and serious concerns Mitchell and Sha raise about the experimentalist tradition - its practical cruelty and its role in banishing the possibility of truth freely given - comes from Goethe, who elaborates, be tween 1817 and 1824, an experimental life science that recognizes this dangerous inheritance and ex pressly transforms it into an art of letting bodies ap pear intact.11 Arendt's paraphrase of the pre Cartesian conviction that "what truly is will appear of its own accord and that human capabilities are ade quate to receive it" is a near-verbatim echo of the avowed premise of Goethean morphology: "Mor phology. Rests on the conviction that everything that is must also indicate and show itself. From the first physical and chemical elements to the intellectual expression of humans, we affirm this basic principle ... it appears as that which it is to our outer and to our inner sense" (Arendt 276; Goethe "Morpho logie" 128). Like Arendt, Goethe sees the mistrust of appearances as sanctioning experimental violence through the assumption that phenomena must be cut open to be known; as Arendt puts it, "only inter ference with appearance, doing away with appear ances, can hold out a true hope for knowledge" (274). So Goethe begins his Morphology project by pointedly laying aside "this severing activity [diese Trennenden Bemühungen]'''' in favor of the living ob jects' "outer, visible, graspable parts in context" ("The Intention Introduced [Die Absicht Eingeleitet]," Zur Morphologie LI, 14). Such appearances are to be taken as credible and sufficient "indexes" of inner activity in an alternative practice of objectivity Goe the grounds in "contemplation [Anschauung]" and "observation [ Beobachtung] " - the precise epistemic postures Arendt laments as extinct ("altogether eliminated") from the 17th century forward. (Goe the, "Intention" 14; "The Undertaking Is Excused [Das Unternehmen wird entschuldigt], ZM 1.1, 11; Ar endt 290-291).12 In Goethean morphology, moreover, experi mental knowledge comes to and through the body of an observer sensible of the "immense drive to subordinate the objects" that first powers his will to know, and who therefore permits those objects to re form that drive into a capacity for "receptivity" and "accommodation" : When the person summoned to lively obser vation [ lebhaften Beobachtung] begins to struggle with Nature, he feels at first an immense drive to subordinate the objects [einen ungeheuren Trieb, die Gegenstände sich zu unterwerfen]. It is not long, however, before they press in on him so force fully, that he well feels how much cause he has to recognize their power and to honor their influence. The observer who acknowledges this recip rocal influence [wechselseitigen Einfluß] becomes aware of the possibility of an infinite training, in so far as he renders his receptivity [Emfän glichkeit], just as much as his judgment [ Urteil], adroit at constantly new forms of accommodation and reaction [Formen des aufnehmens und Gegenwirkens]." ("Undertaking," 11) As this passage makes clear, at stake is a revisionary experimental method geared toward fending off ep istemic and actual domination: a "tender empiri cism," wherein "tender" modifies both observer and observed in an ethos alive at once to the fragility of the object and to the vulnerability of the knower at the scene of experimental trial.13 But notably, the Goethean observer re-educates the will-to-power that lodges in his will-to-know into "constantly new forms" of receptive tenderness not, primarily, by unilateral self-restraint (which would attempt to shield presumptively powerless objects against his own overbearing power), but rather by conceding 145</page><page sequence="4">both power and vulnerability, both action and passiv ity, to both parties to an experiment. For Goethe in such passages, experimental knowing, when it works, subjects the scientific sub ject to objectification by his objects and sets knower and known into a recursive spiral of "influence," "ac commodation" and "reaction." Slyly re-signifying "objectivity" to mean the observer's lack of detach ment from the objects under view - "my thinking does not sunder itself from the objects" - Goethe casts distance and impassivity as defensive pretexts that guard knowers (not their objects) against the very risks which mark the advent of experimental knowledge ("Witty Word," 307). In Arendt's terms, that is, Goethe declines the modern tactic "of re moving the eyes of the mind, no less than the eyes of the body, from the phenomena, of reducing all ap pearances through the force inherent in distance" (267). Avowing instead "the most intimate identifi cation" with them, he unapologetically advocates a form of contemplation in which "the elements of the object, the intuitions, enter into my thinking and are permeated by it" ("Witty Word," 307). In striking proleptic corroboration of Donna Hara way's theory of feminist objectivity - which grasps partiality, embodiment, and situation as indispensa ble requisites, rather than disqualifications, of its knowledge - such revisionary, Romantic experimen talism, insists that sense-based knowledge is charged, inexorably, with dynamics of power, position, and desire (Haraway 580-3). Amounting always to a form of contact, rather than "untethered" and unaffected sight, experimental touch might be modified from brutal and cruel to tender, but feigns disinterest at high ethical cost. As if helpfully exemplifying, with Sha and in his terms, how one might recognize and reject the premises that make for "dirty brainless cruel experi ment," without rejecting experiment completely, Goethe even stages a poetic confrontation with the pioneering experimental physiologist who "discov ered the physiology of sensibility on the backs of nearly two-hundred dogs" (Sha 6, 1). Albrecht von Haller (1708-1777) is "the Physicist" (in the sense of physician) and the poet whom Goethe addresses in the following poem: Allerdings: Dem Physiker (1819/20) „Ins Innre der Natur" — j "Dringt kein erschaffner Geist. * Mich und Geschwister Mögt ihr an solches Wort Nur nicht erinnern! Wir denken: Ort für Ort Sind wir im Innern. uGlückselig, wem sie nur True Enough: To the Physicist "Into the core of Nature" - O Philistine - "No earthly mind can enter" The maxim is fine: But have the grace To spare the dissenter, Me and my kind. We think: in every place We're at the centre. Die äußre Schale weist!" Das hör ich sechzig Jahre wiederholen, Ich fluche drauf, aber verstohlen; Sage mir tausend tausendmale: Alles gibt sich reichlich und gern; Natur hat weder Kern Noch Schale, Alles ist sie mit einem Male. Dich prüfe du nur nur allermeist, Ob du Kern oder Schale seist. "Happy the mortal creature To whom she shows no more Than the outer rind", For sixty years I've heard your sort announce. It makes me swear, though quietly; To myself a thousand times I say: All things she grants, gladly and lavishly; Nature has neither core Nor outer rind, Being all things at once. It's yourself you should scrutinise to see Whether you're centre or periph ery (trans. Michael Hamburger) The maxim that Goethe's poem dismantles - "no created mind can penetrate Nature's interior; blessed is he to whom she shows merely the outer shell" - is Haller's, from Book 4 of his didactic poem The Alps [Die Alpen] (1734).14 While at first glance its professed contentment with given surfaces would seem to agree with Goethe's own commitment to letting objects appear intact, Sha's essay shows how such an adage would have rung with irony in the voice of Haller, a pioneer of animal vivisection for whom such maxims clearly acted as no curb on the impulse to break the skin. The poem thus teases out a crucial distinction: epistemologies that pride themselves on respecting phenomena as mere (which would include, in the sixty year interval to which the poem refers, Kant's fashionable new form of critical modesty) afford them little protection against the will to know more.15 Goethe's poem suggests that it takes a thor ough repudiation of the veridical hierarchy between outer, apparent surface and inner, concealed reality - "nature has neither core nor rind" - to counter the philistine hostility against nature's evident cul ture. Hence the counter-maxim Goethe's poem swears "a thousand thousand times" on behalf of the given as given: Alles gibt sich reichlich und gern - "Eve rything gives itself gladly and lavishly." Hence also that less appealing attitude that seems to over-com pensate Haller's false humility with anthropocentric swagger: "me and my kind / We think: in every place / We're at the centre." A more exact translation - "We think: place for place / We are inside," im In nern, internal or within - nuances the case. Like their final injunction to consider "yourself' a valid and implicated test-case in any knowledge claim lev ied about nature, the objectors in the poem seek not so much to install themselves at the "centre' of na ture (the word does not appear in the German) so much as to insist that they are, inextricably, internal to it, inside and in the midst, however and wherever they may place themselves ("place for place. . ."). 146</page><page sequence="5">Considering themselves implicated instances of a na ture for whom detached experimentation is neither possible nor ethical, they call out, as Arendt would, the illusion of observing from outside as endanger ing the nature it purports to venerate. In Mitchell's terms, "the experience of experiment" is not to be put by. "Romantic science," Sha argues, "was a science in which experience could sometimes purify experi ment" and in which "imaginative experiences could be as empirical as the experiences of sensation" (7). Indeed, multiple senses of "experience," "experi ment," and the "empirical" method reliant upon them, swirl generatively in essays and in period texts. Raymond Williams helps clarify this dense semantic nexus, not least by warning that "almost everything depends on how experience is understood" (Keywords 116).16 Up until the Romantic period, Williams ex plains, experience and experiment could operate as synonyms for a deliberate test or trial, from their common root in Latin, experiri, "to try, to put to the test" (Keywords "Experience" 126, "Empirical" 116). But experience had also assumed broader meaning, taking in not just the trial itself, the experiment, but "a consciousness of what has been tested or tried," and from there "the fact of being consciously the subject of a state or condition, or of being consciously af fected by an event" ("Empirical" 116, OED 4). It is this expansive opening toward conscious ness that Blake leverages in "The Argument" of All Religions Are One (c.1795, [comp. c. 1788]) to launch his own project as distinctly experimental: "As the true meth-/-od of knowledge / is experiment / the true faculty / of knowing must / be the faculty / which experiences, this / faculty I treat of' (3). Telescoping the history of semantic migration be tween experiment as "the true method of knowl edge" and the experiential consciousness (that "the faculty which experiences") that arises therefrom, Blake at once avows this bivalent experimental faculty as "the true faculty of knowing" and casts it as in dire need of poetic treatment ("this faculty I treat of'). Shifting at the same time from definite nouns into the continuous, verbal, present, from "knowl edge" to "knowing," "experiment" to "experiences," Blake's aphorism also mobilizes the temporal ten sion that Williams underscores as critical from the Romantic period forward: that between "experience past," in the sense of knowledge gathered, lessons lived and learned, and "experience present," as "the fullest, most open, most active kind of conscious ness," "feeling as well as thought" ("Experience," 126-127). Corroborated by a crucial Reformation sense of "subjective witness," Williams observes, "ex perience present" came to represent an unimpeach ably authentic kind of subjective truth (128-129). The most immediately and meaningfully con fusing feature of this semantic history is the way "ex perience" functions to ground both objective and subjective knowledge, to authenticate both the most intimately personal and impersonally scientific of truthful testimonies. "Because it can encompass what is being experienced as well as the subjective process of experiencing it," writes Martin Jay in the book-length intellectual history of the issue he names after Blake's Songs of Experience, "the word can sometimes function as an umbrella term to over come the epistemological split between subject and object" (12). Looking closely at Williams' history and Blake and Goethe's mischief with the term, the case might be stated even more strongly: not only can the term overcome and cover over this split, as if coming later and from the outside, but "experience" is invoked to found and ground both sides of the distinction, certifying the trials that establish both authentic subjects and authentic objects, persons and facts. Nor is it just that "experience" performs a deconstructive double-duty, exceeding and under mining the "split between subject and object" it helps to authorize. The value vested in "experience present" in both scientific and psychological contexts, the "ex perimental" and the "experiential" trial, as it were, betrays something positively shared between them, too, especially in their co-evolution with the empiri cist philosophical rejection of rationalist theories of knowledge as "based on conscious application of di recting principles or ideas, arrived at or controlled by reasoning" (Williams 117): an esteem for open endedness and not knowing in advance; a willing ness to expose the known to surprise, embarrass ment, transformation; an attempt to arrange the self or the scene such that something unfamiliar can make itself felt or known.17 And this is where humanist modernity critiques such as Arendt's might judge too suspiciously in see ing straight through experimentalism's arts of re ceptivity to a bad faith and forcible prescription of results: "through the introduction of the experi ment ... we prescribed man-thought conditions to natural processes and forced them to fall into man made patterns" (231).18 As Blake points out in There is No Natural Religion, "Reason or the ra- / tio of all we have / already known, is / not the same that / it shall be when / we know more" [b4]. Which is sim ply to acknowledge that there is something un-pre scribed and un-patterned to knowing in its historical dimension (personal, objective, or collective), some 147</page><page sequence="6">thing that exposes the "known" to qualitative change - it "is not the same that / it shall be" - even when its agents intend only to "know more" and leave the ratio intact [b4]. In the second, 1795 printing of this treatise, Blake adopts that "something" as the unac knowledged "Poetic or Prophetic" dimension of ex perimental knowledge, without which it would, indeed, be merely, ratio-nal: "If it were not for the / Poetic or Prophetic / character, the Philo- / -sophic &amp; Experimen-/ -tal would soon be / at the ratio of all / things. &amp; stand still" (blO[bl 1 ] ). But "the Phil osophic &amp; Experimental" character does not stand still. To observe in this minimal way that what passes for "known" is subject to change by no means en dorses the history of experimental knowledge as progress or denies the devastations of the will to "know more." "More! More!" cries a "mistaken soul" at the center of this printing of There is No Natural Religion, and to summon again Mitchell's generative framework, Blake's treatise in fact grasps the danger ous paradox of modern scientific "world-alienation" in terms that resonate strikingly with Arendt's cri tique. In what she might call "a twofold flight from the earth into the universe and from the world into the self," Blake here casts the modern experimental knower as insatiably driven to colonization "even / of a univer[s]e," yet doomed to "loath [e]" this vast new territory as "a mill with complicated wheels" - an empty image of his own exploitative ingenuity, in which he "sees himself only" (Arendt 6; Blake [b6, bll (blO)]).19 As Arendt comments, "the world of experiment seems always capable of becoming a man-made reality," exactly when it offers the uni verse (288). But Blake sees poetic resistance to such all-con suming "universal doubt" and desire at work within, not outside or in spite of, the history of experimen talism he compresses in the early tractates (Arendt 282).20 There is No Natural Religion advocates the re habilitation of the "Philosophic &amp; Experimental" character's disavowed and disallowed "Poetic" part, that differently desirous part that keeps putting the "known" at risk of knowing otherwise (neither "the same," and nor the "self only"). In Goethe, such ex perimental-poetic desire would court this risk through absorbed and impassioned perception of its objects, rather than detached and professional sight. Blake's treatise, meanwhile, plays on the knower's reliable disgust for possessions - "The bounded is loathed by its possessor" - to reinstate experimental desire as a bottomless loathing of appropriation, "mistaken" for an acquisitive drive: the dis-possessive impulse in the tractates that prefers to lose itself in the intensities of each and any thing, finding them "infinite," rather than finding more.21 There is, Blake suggests, a liable, poetic dimension of the "Philosophic &amp; Experimental" character that is also the portion (dangerously) uncompensated and un satisfied by new exploits and acquisitions: a disal lowed, "Poetic or Prophetic" experimental desire still pressing the knower, in Arendt's words, to "ex perience the reality of what he himself is not" (288). The very title of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience provides a clue to this valued dimension of Blake's first-wave, new scientific inheritance, and thereby to a way in which Baconian "Experimental Philosophy" may be more receptive to "the given" than The Human Condition allows. Williams flags, in passing, Blake's "problematic" employment of "ex perience" in "a troubled contrast with innocence," a pairing so famous that its oddity stands to get lost (127). Taking "innocence" as "experience's" defin ing contrary in a collection subtitled "Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul, " Blake seems to set the Songs firmly in a moral and theological register. But in that register, "corruption," "sin," "knowledge," or "guilt" would all make readier con traries for "Innocence." One discourse that emphati cally yoked "innocence" to "experience," however, was none other than that of Baconian experimentalism. As Joanna Picciotto has brilliantly proved, early-modern experimentalists construed their pro ject as nothing less than the dynamic, collective res toration of "innocence" - a state they wrested from its traditional theological place in an irretrievably lost paradise and reclaimed as an ongoing labor on perception. Far from the secularizing opposite of theology, in Picciotto's account modern scientific objectivity was born in the reformation effort to re construct paradisal perception - to purge, reform, and enhance fallen sensoria in order to reappraise this world with fresh, Adamic eyes. Their project of re-vising the given world "from the estranging per spective of innocence" sounds, to a Romanticist, like nothing so much as the experience of reading Blake's Songs (402).22 For among the many astonishing effects of Pic ciotto's argument for the question of Romantic ex perimentalism is this: in her less suspicious hands, experimentalist theology actually licenses tradition ally forbidden attachments to the world, a world pre viously conceived as so irredeemably corrupt as to merit contempt and transcendence, not intensive curiosity, which was condemned as carnal "lust of the eyes."23 Yet "once experimentalism redefined in nocence as objectivity," Picciotto argues, "the physi cal world itself could become an object of originary 148</page><page sequence="7">desire" (510). In her account, experimentalists' technologies of innocent perception, from their own re-disciplined sensoria to microscopes, telescopes, and the text of Paradise Lost, did not so much orchestrate the (illusion of) escape from earth that Arendt chronicles as "restore their read ers to the world in which they already live [d]," albeit through "an alien experience of the known" (Ar endt 265; Picciotto 510, 184). Piciotto's thesis not only makes audible a series of striking resonances between Baconian and Ro mantic experimentalism; it also nuances Arendt's more absolute notion of experimentalist "world alienation," which renders it virtually synonymous with total "worldlessness" (Picciotto 402; Arendt 253, e.g.). While both Labors of Innocence and The Human Condition diagnose experimentation as driven by a deep mistrust of sensory self-evidence, Picciotto's ac count shows how this skeptical energy could target the body of the observer and apparatuses of observa tion precisely in order to spare the observable world from disbelief and disaffection, to refuse to relin quish it for "lost." Here the Galilean blow to the credibility of appearances discredits not the reality of the non-human world so much as humans' none too-impressive record of allowing it to appear. In this view, new scientific experimental ani mus interrogates less the independent reality of things than the mental prejudices and physical limi tations - "Idols of the Tribe," the "Cave," the "Mar ketplace," and the "Theater," in Bacon's idiom - that distort and inhibit their perception: distortions that would, by the 19th century, be called ideology. Picciotto suggests that Baconian arts of experimen tal de-familiarization might be understood as proto types of modern ideology critique, were they not so frequently its targets (27). Blake's debt to this form of experimental innocence patently drives perhaps his most famous slogan: "if the doors of perception were cleansed / every thing would appear to man as it is, in -/-finite" (Marriage 14.17-19). By this logic, fallen finitude and falsity are remediable conditions of perception, not of things; and more importantly, so is the very split between being and appearing - the split between what "is" and what "appear [s] to man" - that Arendt narrates as an irreversible event. Indeed, as the irreversible historical advent of mod ern science: "Being and Appearance part company for ever . . . everything must be doubted" (275). Wielding his print-maker's "corrosives" as "instru ments of innocent perception" according to a differ ent experimentalist logic, Blake applies his cleansers to ideological residues in perception occluding a re ality that has not, in fact, ceased to be given (Picci oto 510; 14.14). What this (regrettably swift and broad) con junction between Blake and the Baconians suggests is that, under changed epistemic circumstances, the embodied arts of receiving what is given may come to include not only the classical stillness of contem plation in Arendt's sense, and the graceful literary modalities of near-weightless reception to which Anne-Lise François has brilliantly sensitized Roman tic studies, but also an excoriating, experimentalist mode and mood: attitudes and techniques, like Blake's, of furious combat against whatever pres ently narrows the odds of phenomena being per ceived and believed. What Blake, no less than Goethe, will contest as a Romantic-era obstacle to experimental knowing in its full, poetic liability to "know otherwise" - that self-implicating "experience" of otherness that at once estranges and re-attaches knower and known - is the illusion that such experimental knowledge can be had at the safe and impartial distance coming to be called, in the 19th century, "objective."24 And like Arendt, Blake casts this illusion as an unintended consequence of a favored first-wave technique of ex perimental estrangement: virtual disembodiment and "withdrawal from terrestrial proximity." Hence Blake's engagement with the reformation experi mentalist legacy called "Milton" emphatically binds it at once to earth and to a body with the ties Blake calls "earthly lineaments" (M 29.11). Trading heavily in the chastisement of bodily desire that English speakers still call Puritanical, ref ormation experimental philosophers had staked their theological and epistemic legitimacy - their very innocence and their discipline - on the differ ence between their rigorously restored techniques of rational insight and that corrupted, sensual "lust of the eyes"; indeed, the task of chastening the one into the other lay at the core of their collective en terprise (Picciotto 225-242, Marriage 14:9-10).25 In the long-18th century interval dividing Blake from the new science, however, the kind of bodily sensual ity that first-wave experimentalists had censured as a hindrance on perception became not only an object of intensive experimental curiosity in its own right, but also its freshly rediscovered and revalued sub ject. As the new experimental life sciences explored the sensibility, irritability, and excitability of mere bodily filaments, some saw these abilities as an unac knowledged source of the knowledge accrued in sensory observation and set about asking what else the observer's historically disreputable body might know.26 It is no accident that the epic Blake dedicated to Milton, the quintessential radical protestant ex 149</page><page sequence="8">perimentalist poet, is in many ways a tour through such neglected "nether / Regions of the Imagina tion." Hijacking Miltonic purgative energies to cleanse and open sensual and appetitive organs of ill repute - "the Loins &amp; Seminal Vessels . . . the Stom ach &amp; Intestines terrible, deadly unutterable" - Blake claims many of the stunning passages as prod ucts of genital and intestinal revelation: "And he whose Gates are opend in those Regions of his Body / Can from those Gates view all these wondrous Imaginations" (Milton 34.15-18).27 In an epic whose main plot is to bring Milton down from Heaven to Earth, Blake's weirdly pedes trian mode of receiving Miltonic inspiration - "Milton entering my Foot; I saw in the nether / Re gions of the imagination" - is the sly and tender takedown that makes of the poem's revisionary ex perimentalism also a form of reluctant terrestrial commitment. As an allegory of production, it casts the epic as an effect of grounding the experimental ist heritage, of obliging the keen arts of experimen tal perspicacity ("Milton") to enter a lowly and specific bodily member: to "return to the body" in a double sense of conceding to study and to have one, which is also to assume the partial perspective of someone standing somewhere. The revisionary ex perimentalist task of the speaker of these lines, meanwhile, is to own and express being both object and subject of this experiment, not agent or patient of an podiatric operation, but middle-voiced party to an estranging "experience" of seeing-fry-Foot that the poem Milton records. Here knowing otherwise can be a proximity-effect that begins with one's own body precisely in so far as it is not one's own: "man cannot know / What passes in his members" at once, Blake explains, "for more extensive / Than any other earthly things, are Mans earthly lineaments." To have a body made of parts is already to be per vaded with happenings and distances that precede and exceed conscious knowledge. Yet not, in this passage, due to psychic or organismic depths, but rather to a peculiar form of linear "extensi[on]" Blake call's "Mans earthly lineaments" - outlines or contours that seem to draw his body into the earth's extensive topography and to ensure that it will elude his grasp. One way to quickly telegraph the difference be tween Arendt and Blake's reluctant ter^estrialism and the familiar form of environmentalist conscious ness that coalesced in the decade after The Human Condition (1958) is to notice how and in what mood they predicted the (to others) inspirational photo graphs of the earth from outer-space realized in the late 1960s. For instance: the famous Apollo 17 snap shot of the earth as "The Blue Marble," suddenly en tire and preciously small, captured by astronauts on route to the moon. A galvanizing emblem for the new counter-cultural environmental consciousness, the image made the cover of Stewart Brandt's Whole Earth Catalog (1969) and John McConnell's Earth Day Flag of the same year. A decade earlier, mean while, Arendt conjured and lamented a very similar image of a planet "shr[u]nk . . . into a ball" by astro physical ingenuity. "Only now," she wrote in 1958 af ter the launch of Sputnik, "has man taken full possession of his mortal dwelling place and gathered the infinite horizons, which were temptingly and forbiddingly open to all previous ages, into a globe whose majestic outlines and detailed surface he knows as he knows the lines in the palm of his hand" (250). For Arendt, this handy earth, manipulable "from the viewpoint of the universe," (248) is the bleak and unsurprising realization of earth-escape fantasies centuries in the making. The Human Condi tion puts Galileo, or better, his telescope, at the sym bolic origin of this crisis: the instrument not only displaced the earth and its most privileged inhabi tants from the center of the cosmos but also proved that their senses had deceived them for generations; and, just as importantly, demonstrated that techni cal ingenuity might compensate the fallibility of bodily vision. "We lost reality," she writes, in the form of "the twofold assumption that what is will ap pear of its own accord and that human capabilities are adequate to receive it" (262, 276). No longer be lieving themselves recipients of truth freely given, Arendt argues, scientific moderns learned to rely ex clusively certainties they make themselves: those es tablished through constructed experimental scenarios, on the one hand (254, 265, 299), and those derived from the patterns of their own minds, on the other (280-291). Realizing the ancient wish for "a point outside the earth from which to unhinge the world" (262), Arendt argues, the new science pioneered the mode of as-yet-virtual "withdrawal from terrestrial proxim ity" that now literally exposes her Space Age world to annihilation: For whatever we do today in physics—whether we release energy processes that ordinarily go on only in the sun, or attempt to initiate in a test tube the processes of cosmic evolution. . .or at tain speeds in atomic accelerators which ap proach the speed of light, or produce elements not to be found in nature—we always handle na ture from a point in the universe outside the earth . . . still bound to the earth through the human condition, we have found a way to act on 150</page><page sequence="9">the earth and within terrestrial nature as though we dispose of it from outside, from the Archime dean point. And even at the risk of endangering the natural life process we expose the earth to universal, cosmic forces alien to nature's house hold. (262) Here Arendt's reluctant ecology presses into the foreground in a book whose aspirational vision has, up to this point, culminated in extricating a realm of political freedom from the grip of "nature's household." Such a thing as the earthly nature ought to be precisely what theory can and must take for granted. The astonishing present fact that this is not possible, then, tacitly drives searching historical interrogation of The Human Condition into what happened to "the given" and to the ability of philosophy to take it: "I do not discuss this modern world," she writes in the Prologue of the age "born with the first atomic ex plosions . . . against whose background this book was written" (6). Yet the earth keeps edging in at the margins, and when Arendt grants, in the Prologue, that "our present ability to destroy all organic life on earth" is a "political question of the first order," she does so at considerable cost to the political ideal ad vanced in bulk of the book, putting firmly into the past tense the theory by which terrestrial life exem plified a pre- and anti-political substratum, the prop erly mute and hidden contents of the "private sphere" (2-3). Permitting the earth to appear in public, as it were, Arendt puts into question the firm distinction between public and private life that has underwritten her ideal of politics; and she makes her idea of politics poignantly contemporary, still (2). The view from outer-space did not bode well in her eyes, and, as for Bruno Latour and Jane Bennett very recently, and Blake two centuries before, ge ocentrism, of all perspectives, begins to look critical and timely again.28 In "The Conquest of Space and the Stature of Man," an essay closely related to clos ing and opening passages of The Human Condition, Arendt hazards a solution she thinks possible, yet not at all probable, to "the present predicaments of science and technology" (279). Pointing out in Blakean style that even conquests of new possessions in outer space would come to seem "limited," Ar endt thinks it would be "entirely beneficial" if space exploration were to issue in a worldview "once more geocentric and anthropomorphic," albeit "not in the old sense of the earth being the center of the universe and of man being the highest being there is" (278).29 Instead, "It would be geocentric in the sense that the earth, and not the universe, is the center and the home of mortal men, and it would be anthropomorphic in the sense that man would count his own factual mortality among the elemen tary conditions under which his scientific efforts are possible at all." (279) Blake is equally eager to dis pense with the Galilean universal perspective: "As to that false appearance which appears to the rea soned, / As of a Globe rolling thro Voidness," he maintains in Milton "it is a delusion of Ulro" (fight ing words) (Milton 29.15-17). The "Spaces" properly "called Earth," Blake ar gues, are those "that a Man views around his dwell ing-place," the visible "neighborhood" at whose margins the sun, heavens and clouds "reach no fur ther but here bend and set": And every Space that a Man views around his dwelling-place: 5 Standing on his own roof, or in his garden on a mount Of twenty-five cubits in height, such space is his Universe; And on its verge the Sun rises &amp; sets, the Clouds bow To meet the flat Earth &amp; Sea in such an orderd Space: The Starry heavens reach no further but here bend and set 10 On all sides &amp; the two Poles turn on their valves of gold: And if he move his dwelling-place, his heavens also move. Wher'eer he goes all his neighborhood bewail his loss: Such are the Spaces called Earth &amp; such its dimension: As to that false appearance which appears to the reasoned, 15 As of a Globe rolling thro Voidness, it is a delusion of Ulro The Microscope knows not of this nor the Telescope. They alter The ratio of the Spectators Organs but leave Objects untouched (Milton 29.5-18) Patently, unapologetically, and technically anthro pomorphic, "the Spaces called Earth" take human shape in Blake's passage by conforming to the spe cific sensory limitations of "a Man." They "bend" to meet the "verge" of his visual field in a way that care fully delineates the partiality and puniness of a mode of perception "orderd" in "cubits" and contin gent on the place where one is "Standing." This an thropomorphic conception of "Earth," I would argue, works less as a tactic of epistemological domi nation, of human self-projection upon or forcible identification with the earth, than to attach the "spaces called Earth" to "a Man" as the name for spe cific and ineluctable limits on his sensing, for an an thropic distortion that might be called, following Arendt, an unexceptional human condition rather than privilege, entitlement, right or aspiration. "Earth" and the temporal cycles it entails moves with him, "Wher'eer he goes," as the insuperable limit and situation of his seeing and knowing. For when Blake adds, "And if he move his dwelling-place, his heavens also move," it becomes clear that the anthropomorphic figuration of the earth is also a geomorphic figuration of the man, wherein "earthly space" becomes a feature of his sensorium, attribute of his eyes, an entailment of his 151</page><page sequence="10">body borne or carried as it moves. In "the Spaces called Earth," the specific sphere of sensory exten sion usually cast as "environment" so enfolds and is enfolded into "a Man" that each implicate the other in a way that rather exactly recalls Goethe's verse: "me and my kind / we think: place for place / We're inside." Yet this is not because the Earth is his own projection, a "man-made reality," which, as Arendt teaches, he would always have to suspect as unreal. The rhetoric of neighborly hospitality by which clouds "bow" and heavens "bend" to "meet" his perceptual limits underscore instead the sense of spaces "given": collaborated, perhaps, but not unilat erally made.30 The passage, that is, affirms the par tial truth of "the Spaces called Earth" as they appear to an observer "Standing" in and among them. And by "partial" I mean biased, incomplete, limited and compromised by contact, one way to understand "figurative" as an alternative to "false."31 "False" is what Blake calls a view from nowhere and apart: "that false appearance which appears to the rea soned / As of a Globe rolling thro Voidness." In this terrestrialist experimental scene, anthropomorphic figuration marks the distortion of inexhaustive con tact; such transfigurative knowledge, Blake worries, is precisely what the "Microscope" and the "Tele scope" cannot know when they "leave Objects untouched." The affirmation of "Earth" as what "a Man" cannot but be in the middle of, even after neither person nor planet is taken for the center of anything else is the kind of reconstructed geocentrism Blake and Arendt are sometimes after. Blake soon returns, in Milton, to the limited scene of earthly space, in a famous passage on "the nature of infinity" that helps show how such mundane spaces condition the form of dis-possessive experimental desire Blake theo rized in his early tracts - even, if, as lately, the Earth does not appear in accustomed ways. In this revision of the human celestial "neighborhood," phenomena acquire familiar contours only at a distance and in the weaker limits of perception, "infolding" into a "globe" or even "a human form" when the perceiver has "passd" them by or put them past him. Nearer to hand and underfoot, things unfurl when not in fo cus, encompassing his viewpoint and sustaining, in the spaces between forms, the indistinct surround that supports his sight. And to experience this form of seeing in the midst that knows itself to be sub tended by terrestrial ground, whatever else it hopes to see - is to "kee[p] onward," Blake writes, in a "wondrous journey on the earth." Hence a small, surprise coup for terrestrial over space-travel in a poem replete with extraterrestrial and supernatural vistas: calling the earth "A vortex not yet pass'd" and the heavens "a vortex passd already," Blake suggests that human adventurers are bound for, as well as bound to, the earth's subsuming, sublunary passages. NOTES 1 This essay derives from remarks given in response to a session on "Romanticism and Experiment,'" organized by Robert Mitchell, at the North American Society far the Study of Romanticism meeting, Washington, D.C., July 9-13, 2014.1 am grateful to Mitchell, Richard Sha, and Noel Jackson for inviting me to respond to their trenchant essays in person, and to Sha and Mitchell for continuing the conversation in print. 21 allude to the "Introduction" and "EARTH'S An swer," in which a bardic voice implores the earth to re turn - "O Earth O Earth return! . . . Turn away no more an apostrophe that catches his addressee in a paradox of figure and ground (for "she" is also the ground), and requires her to appear as remembered in a way that blocks her ongoing appearing - "cruel [ties] " for which "EARTH'S Answer" severely reprimands him, in a prosopopeia that does not go as planned. I inter pret these poems in a longer version of this essay. 3Blake objects, for instance, in his annotations to Wordsworth's Poems (2. Vols, London, 1815) that "Nat ural Objects always did &amp; now do Weaken deaden &amp; obliterate Imagination in Me" [44], and fumes fa mously against "this Vegetable Glass of Nature" [69] in "A Vision of The last Judgment": "Mental Things are alone Real; what is Calld Corporeal Nobody Knows of its dwelling Place; it is in Fallacy &amp; its Existence an Im posture. . . I assert for myself that I do not behold the Outward Creation &amp; that to me it is hindrance &amp; not Action; it is as the Dirt upon my feet, No part of Me" [95]. I take license for ultimately revaluing the dirt un derfoot for Blake in this essay from the way his animus against "Nature" quite technically targets a distortion in perception and mediation of the "Real" (a "Glass," an "Imposture," a fallacious mode of "Call[ing]"), when and only when that distortion is leveraged to cast injustice as necessity. For however partially and opaquely, animal and vegetable and mineral phenom ena as they appear to the body natural frequently oper ate as attenuate indexical signs of the order called "Real" in Blake. Milton tells readers, for instance, that the dancing motions of ephemerids and of wind-blown trees ("To touch each other &amp; recede; to cross &amp; change &amp; return") compose the fragile and distal edges of the spectacular "Visions of Eternity" that the epic is otherwise narrating (Milton 26.2-12). 4And Maijorie Levinson's lead, too: compare her now two-decade-old observations on the ways that the "the changed function of nature in the present" bring 152</page><page sequence="11">certain "pre- or non-Cartesian paradigms" within Ro manticism into critical relief. "Pre- and Post-Dialectical Materialism," 116. 5Writing of disclosures of "the given" in in this way bespeaks my debt to Anne-Lise François, Romanticists' foremost theorist of such revelations: of experience that is there for the taking or leaving; of the lyric and narrative modalities of taking for granted, letting ap pear, and letting lie; and of the ecological (in)significance of doing so ( Open Secrets xvi). The mis chief, which I hope will not entirely defeat the pur pose, is to approach givenness through Blake - that is, in a register of furious, emancipatory desire at utter tonal and political odds with Wordsworthian "natural piety" (François, "O Happy Living Things" ; Mitchell 4 9). 6Latour's name for the "former humans" capable of answering the anthropocene exigency to accept earth as an agent in their "common geostory" rather than the natural background to their history, is "The Earthbound." Bennett, meanwhile, has lately affirmed her "Earthling status" as a mode of avowing "the faith that humans belong to the earth, even if the earth doesn't belong to humans" (np). Latour's notion the political statements of the "Earthbound" will elude the dichotomy between "the exact transcription of the world" (semiotics of science) and "an arbitrary sign un connected from its referent" (semiotics of literature) by activating previously suspect "morphisms" that "draw what they are bound to" in entanglement with "former 'forces of nature'" has profound affinities with the rhetoric of terrestrial implication I theorize towards the end of this essay ("Agency," 14-16). 'Christine Gerhardt has used the phrase "reluc tant ecology" to describe Emily Dickinson's poetics of place. 8Thus even the militantly supernatural, composite prophet protagonist of Blake's Milton stoops to bind "all this Vegetable World" to his foot as necessary foot wear - a "bright sandal" - for his "walk forward thro' Eternity." 9On the (to some) oxymoronic notion of "Roman tic empiricism," particularly in the context of German philosophy, compare the splendid, kindred work of Dalia Nassar. 10The derogatory senses Sha reanimates in his essay - "The empirick was thus a quack who knows nothing but skullduggery," e.g. - stem from the word empirical's roots in Greek medicine, and could connote "a positive opposition or indifference to theory," even as the neu tral sense of "reliance on observation and experiment" gained importance from the 17th Century New Science forward (Williams 115-116). 111 discuss Goethe's "tender empiricism," his life science, "morphology," and their connection to Lucre tian materialism at length in Sweet Science (under re view); and, briefly, in "Obsolescent Life." 12Goethe's rehabilitation of Anschauung, particu larly in the context of his Kant-reception, has been a topic of much critical discussion; see Eckart Förster, The Twenty-Five Years. 13The full aphorism, appearing in the 2nd (1828/ 9) edition of Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre, reads: "There is a tender empiricism, that identifies most inti mately with the object and thereby becomes actual the ory. But this heightening of the intellectual capacities belongs to a highly cultivated age [Es gibt eine zarte Em pirie, die sich mit dem Gegenstand innigst identisch macht und dadurch zur eigentlichen Theorie wird. Diese Steigerung des geistigen Vermögens aber gehört einer hochgebildeten Zeit an]." MA 20.2, 1162-1165 (commentary 20.3, 953); and 17, 532. 14Die Alpen, Kapitel 4, "Die Falschheit menschlicher Tugenden [The Falseness of Human Virtues], An den Herrn Prof. Stähelin, 1730," lines 289-90. 15See Weatherby on the Haller-Kant-Goethe tri angulation around the maxim. 16I owe to Kevis Goodman the habit of looking to Williams on "experience"; her engagement with Wil liams on this subject extends into a brilliant theory of poetry's capacity to mediate the experience of present historicity. See her Géorgie Modernity, 1-16. 17Implications of Peter Dear's notion of the "event experiment." 18Even the execrable, justly notorious new scien tific rhetoric around nature as an artful tease requiring capture, penetration, and domination may not wholly reduce to a misogynistic alibi for exploitation. Casting "Nature" as a playful, devious, more-than-match for human experimental ingenuity, and indeed, as the "mother" and genus of that ingenuity, also grants to the "other" summoned to the scene of experiment a capacity to defy its built-in expectations. Moreover, early modern experimentalist procedure was built to engage a Nature thought capable of deviating from the normal course of things (Daston and Park 255-301, 329-364). Something closer to this version of Nature - at once more powerful and more vulnerable than its later modern, Newtonian image as "law" - might be the figure that is revisiting the denizens of the anthro 153</page><page sequence="12">pocene: "Quite a Trickster, this Gaia," comments Bruno Latour, ("Waiting for Gaia" 9); compare Hara way on "Coyote or Trickster" as an alternative to the "mother/matter/mutter" quagmire. 19Not least because he has surely imported his ex ploitative mode of production with him. 20Like Blake, who fulminates against "Bacon, Locke &amp; Newton" - their "Science is Despair" because it purveys "doubt &amp; calls it knowledge" - Arendt singles out "doubt" as the hallmark of modern science and philosophy, which evinces at once "a demonstrable, ever-quickening increase in human knowledge and power . . . and the hardly less demonstrable increase in human despair" (Blake, Milton 41.5, 15; Arendt 261). 21My compressed interpretation of the tractate's re maining plates, which, having positioned desire against possessive binding, reclaim the faculty itself as the one possible in-finite (boundary-defying) possession, which is also to make the possessor capable of "see [ing] the infinite in all things" [b8-bl2]. 22Or, for that matter, Coleridge's grasp of Words worth's defamiliarizing task in Lyrical Ballads, that of awakening readers "to the wonders of the world before us; an inexhaustible treasure, but for which in conse quence of the film of familiarity and selfish solicitude we have eyes, yet see not, ears that hear not, and hearts that neither feel nor understand" (Biographia 11.14 6 7). 23Building on Hans Blumenberg's seminal thesis in The Legitimacy of the Modern Age. 24The ideal of "knowledge that bears no trace of the knower," however, may express scientific culture's response to the newly felt risk of subjective self-projec tion exemplified in Kant's epistemology - a response that, Lorrain Daston and Peter Galison argue, did not take broad hold until the middle of the 19th century (Daston and Galison, 17). This re-periodization cor roborates what Romanticists are increasingly discover ing: that Romantic scientific attitudes are full of non Kantian subject-object relations. Daston also makes a strong case for the contemporary value of pre-episte mological approaches to the matter of observation for science and technology studies (Daston, "Observa tion"). See, in this context, Mitchell's openings toward an ontological account of sensation in Experimental Life, 43-73. 25Reformation experimental theology, Picciotto shows, personified the distinction between the two cu riosities, championing an "Adam" considered exem plary of chaste and rational insight - of peering without touching into the natures of the beasts and as signing their right names - against an Eve whose appe titive curiosity led her to eat what she wished to know (225-231). 26See Crary, 73, and Goldstein, "Irritable Figures." 27Thus the artist's purgative work on the doors of perception is called "infernal," rather than paradisal, in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: it "will come to pass by an improvement of / sensual enjoyment." The ex perimental life scientific context gives a new, epistemo logical dimension to the seemingly tired theme of sex lib in Blake. 28Like Blake and Arendt, Latour is particularly in terested in a tactical revival of the the distinction be tween sub- and superlunary worlds, terrestrial and universal science ("Waiting for Gaia" 9). 29Recalling the proposition from There is No Natural Religion discussed above: "The bounded is Loathed by its possessor, The same dull round even of a univer[s]e would soon become a mill with complicated wheels," There is No Natural Religion, [b6]. 30Here the human-conformed features of an an thropomorphism do not cease to attest to the pressure of something else. See Hutchings on the "bi-valent an thropomorphism," and Lussier's exploration of "signi fying nature" in Blake's ecology, which, nearly twenty years ago, brought Blake's position into contact with the notion of nonmodernity in early Latour ("Blake's Deep Ecology" 405, 408). 31 Compare Haraway: "So, not so perversely, objec tivity turns out to be about particular and specific em bodiment and definitely not about the false vision promising transcendence of all limits and responsibili ties. The moral is simple: only partial perspective promises objective vision" (582-583). WORKS CITED Arendt, Hannah. The Human Condition. 2nd ed. University of Chicago Press, 1998; Bennett, Jane.
