SCHECHTER Keywords: Pacific Islands, archaeology, Lapita pottery, iconography, turtles Abstract The principal design motifs characteristic of Lapita ceramic iconography are conventionally described as anthropomorphic both in appearance and in symbolic intent. Based on recent systematic research by a number of archaeologists, it is now possible to offer a more nuanced interpretation of the meaning and importance of this iconography to Pacific Islanders during and after the widespread popularity of Lapita as a pottery style. We argue that the most likely interpretation is that most but not all of the faces on Lapita vessels may be variant representations of sea turtles, not human beings. Furthermore, while this distinctive ware has been used to support broad inferences about the social organization, motivations, and religious ideas of its makers and users, Lapita designs may not be 'saying' symbolically what many now evidently believe them to be saying, and their historical importance may be other than what many currently say it is. appearance and were intended to be regarded as such by their makers. More to the point, nobody to our knowledge has explained why this is so. In some instances, the faces do have a human-like form, but not always, as Green (1973: 334, 1979a: 21-22, 1979b) pointed out years ago. Furthermore, it does not take much familiarity with Oceanic material culture to realize that even the most seemingly human-like masks, carvings, and other constructions made of wood, clay, stone, bone, wickerwork, and the like in the Pacific may not be intended as representations of human beings. Spirits, demons, and the like do not have to be portrayed as anatomically strange or non-human to be considered non-human, although the well- known spirit boards of the Papuan Gulf, so often identified by art dealers as 'ancestor boards', show how difficult it can Figure 1. Tace' design on three potsherds excavated at the Talepakemalai archaeological site in the Mussau Islands, Papua New Guinea (redrawn by Jill Seagard from Kirch 1997: fig. 5.6). We are not confident we know who was the first person to suggest that the 'eyes', 'noses', and 'faces' sometimes seen drawn on Lapita pottery sherds and whole vessels are those of human beings, i.e. that they are anthropomorphic in Regenstein Pacific Research &amp; Collections Program, Department of Anthropology, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, IL 60605 USA. terrell@fieldmuseum.org be for foreign eyes to grasp local sensibilities (Welsch 2006: 6, 22). Nor is there much about the shape or appearance of most of the anatomical features drawn on Lapita vessels that is undeniably human-like (Figure 1). Yet in now-classic papers, for instance, Matthew Spriggs (1990a, 1993) described Lapita iconography as anthropomorphic, and ever since then others (e.g. Best 2002; Chiù 2005, 2007; Kirch 1997: 132-140, 2000; Sand 2007) have apparently accepted this appraisal despite 45</page><page sequence="2">Spriggs' own disclaimer on one occasion (1993: 14, n. 1) that he was using this term as a matter of convenience. In his words, they 'may have had totally different meanings to the makers and users of the Lapita pots themselves'. Nonetheless, for example, Simon Best a decade later answered the question How much of the Lapita design system represents the human face? with a confident 'a significant amount' (Best 2002: 50). Elsewhere we have offered several congruent lines of archaeological and ethnographic evidence (Terrell and Schechter 2007) leading to the alternative inference that what was probably being portrayed or referenced in at least some instances was something held to be important about sea turtles (Figure 2). After our report came out in 2007, Scarlett Chiù (2007) and Christophe Sand (2007) published additional information on the chronology, geography, and variability of Lapita iconography. We can now generalize further on our previous observations. Formerly we were unsure how common turtle symbolism is on decorated Lapita pottery. It is now possible to suggest that turtle iconography in one form or another may have been the major symbolic allusion, or 'message', being expressed in this fashion. Familiar interpretations What difference does it make how human or non-human we take the eyes and faces drawn on Lapita pots to be? There is the obvious concern for historical accuracy. In addition, these potsherds and occasional whole vessels are often used to support ideas about the peopling of the Pacific (e.g. Sand 2007: 265). In our opinion, doing so may be pushing this elusive evidence too far. We are not naïve enough to think that evidence, archaeological or otherwise, can stand on its own. How anybody interprets things or events is always to some degree dependent on the contexts viewed as making things and events worthy of note. It is not unreasonable, however, to worry that too little can be made of things and events, and too much may be made of the contexts into which people may see them as fitting. For this reason, we will distinguish here between the meaning of Lapita motifs, on one hand, and their importance, on the other. For the people who made and used these pottery containers of various shapes and sizes, meaning and importance may have been one and the same. Not so for archaeologists today who must infer both from the surviving evidence at hand (Terrell 2001). Evidence Thanks in particular to comprehensive work being done by Scarlett Chiù (2007) and Christophe Sand (2007), it is now possible to get a far surer sense of the character, chronology, and geographic distribution of Lapita design elements and motifs in all their observed variation. Drawing on what these two scholars and others have now reported, the following describes certain key dimensions of present knowledge concerning this ancient pottery. 1. The earliest evidence of pottery making in the Pacific comes from the Mussau Islands where the finds recovered by Patrick Kirch (1988) and his colleagues (Hunt 1989) suggest that to begin with it was necessary for potters to locate and experiment with different clays from different locales (Ambrose 2007: 213; Summerhayes and Allen 2007: 115). Further, finished vessels may have been sent on occasion to other communities - including communities not then engaged in pottery making. 2. With the exception of the Mussau Islands, however, most Lapita pots were made and exchanged only locally throughout the broader geographic range of their production and use in the Pacific (Chiù 2007: 241; Clark 2007; Summerhayes and Allen 2007: 98, 107-9). 3. Although Chiù (below) has argued that the iconography applied to decorated Lapita vessels served as 'signs of history' (Chiù 2005: 4-6, 14-15), when decorated pots broke, they did not necessarily have to be discarded in some special way or in some special place since decorated potsherds are found in refuse middens, as well as here and there around living ('occupation') areas (with a notable exception, see: Clark 2007; Sand et al 1998). 4. It is now possible to recognize archaeologically several variant regional - that is, geographically definable - styles Figure 2.

Reel" Islands; adapted from Spriggs 1990: fig. 2. and revised as suggested by Scarlett Chiù (pers. comm.). 46</page><page sequence="3">within the Lapita pottery tradition based on vessel shapes (Marshall 2008) as well as on specific design elements and motifs (Chiù 2007: 241-242; Sand 2007: 281-283). To a certain extent, different types of designs and motifs were applied to different kinds of vessels in these several style regions, although there are also many points of shared commonality (Chiù 2007: 243). 5. Both naturalistic and abstract face motifs were drawn on Lapita pots at the same time and in the same places (Chiù 2007: 244). 6. Chiù and Sand have shown that while design elements and motifs are variable within the Lapita repertoire, the same basic production rules governing how elements should be combined into full-fledged motifs were evidently well- known and widely followed by the potters. As Stuart Bedford (2006a: 545) among others has noted, design elements were apparently used according to particular rules governing motif production, although in practice, following these rules varied from time to time and place to place. 7. Writing specifically about the New Caledonian region, Sand (2007: 270) reports that only nine categories of dentate-stamped geometric patterns, four categories of dentate-stamped anthropomorphic patterns, and one major category of incised patterning are sufficient to classify the design variation found in the central band of decoration seen on tens of thousands of decorated sherds examined to date. 8. Sand (2007: 268) also reports, again with particular reference to the same area within Lapita's geographic range (but perhaps applicable elsewhere): 'As already identified by Siorat nearly two decades ago, the principle of decoration for the Southern Lapita Province has been systematically constructed around a two-part structure: a central motif horizontally encircling the pot and always surrounded by a series of horizontal friezes over and under the central motif . Also relevant to later discussion here are several findings that Chiù has written extensively about in recent years: 9. The faces in the design category she calls 'triangular' (Chiù 2007: fig. 3), which includes the motif that Spriggs earlier called the 'double-face' motif (Spriggs 1990a; and see here: Figure 2), always have the lower triangular face drawn in; the upper, more evidently 'anthropomorphic' face was often replaced on vessels, however, with a variety of other designs, including ones that resemble hats, horns, plumes, leaves, and so on (also: Sand 2007: 276-277; Spriggs 1993: 9). 10. Chiù (2007: 249-251) has divided Spriggs' original 'single face' design type into two sub-categories: 'The first is the Long-nose with earplugs (L) that still contains the more complex structure of a face; and secondly, the Simplified face motif (S), where earplugs disappeared from the design and geometric eye designs replaced the more naturalistic Long-nose design.' Except for the lack of triangular framing, both sorts have much in common with triangular faces (compare Chiù 2007: figs. 3-4 with Chiù 2007: fig. 6). It is possible that the two hanging sides of the so-called 'triangular face' motif should actually be seen as elements that are part of the design framing for faces, i.e., that triangular faces are variants of what Chiù has labeled as the 'Long-nose' and 'Simplified face' motifs. 11. Spriggs (1990a, 1993) and Chiù (2007: 251) have shown how instructive it can be to analyze Lapita designs not only by reference to their component design elements, but also by the structural rules apparently governing their assembly into larger motifs and completed decoration. Doing so, for example, makes it possible to argue that both x-shaped design elements and oval (and more 'eye-like') design elements, sometimes nothing more than a half-circle (Sand 2007: figs. 21-23), were probably seen by Lapita potters as alternative ways of expressing the same or at least comparable symbolic intentions (Chiù 2007: fig. 7; Sand 2007: figs. 21-23; Spriggs 1993: 7-8, 10). Finally what has been reported or surmised about how Lapita pottery was made will also be relevant here: 12. Patrick Kirch (1997: 150-153) and others have suggested that decorated Lapita pottery, which at least in some instances seems less skillfully made than plain Lapita pottery, may have been produced by men, not by women - who are usually credited with having made the latter for everyday domestic use. Matthew Spriggs (2002: 54) has raised objections to this idea, but most recently Marshall has noted how decorated Lapita pottery is quite different from plain Lapita ware: 'it is of different manufacture, it comprises different vessel forms, it is used for different tasks - serving and display rather than storage or cooking', and its context of use is also different (Marshall 2008: 71; see also: Ambrose 2007; Clark 2007; Summerhayes 2007). 13. Amongst pottery-making communities in New Guinea today (May and Tuckson 1982), not everyone male or female is a potter. If Chiu's (2005: 14-17, 20) premise is correct that Lapita iconography served as 'signs' or 'crests' of shared history variously used by ancient Pacific Islanders to differentiate descent groups within and beyond residential communities, or alternatively to unify them, then each such group would have needed someone both capable and socially licensed, so to speak, to make decorated Lapita pots (e.g. Roscoe 1995). In other words, Chiu's suspicions about the meaning of Lapita iconography would lend support to the inference that plain and decorated Lapita pots were not necessarily made by the same potters. 14. The issue of who made decorated Lapita pots is an indirect way of asking what were the social, emotional, and religious contexts within which this ceramic ware was produced and used. If making decorated pots was a communally important task - perhaps even a sacred and ritually dangerous undertaking - then there is ample ethnographic witness from the Pacific (e.g. Williams 1940) suggesting that the production of such ornate objects would probably have been done in special places, under proscribed circumstances, and with considerable attention to attendant protocols, rites, and so forth. In other words, however striking, attractive, or unusual we find these decorated 47</page><page sequence="4">potsherds and whole vessels to be today, their original manufacture may have been a serious and sacred undertaking. Meaning It is not self-evident that the persistence of certain designs and design motifs over time and space must be meaningful in some special sense not just to archaeologists, but also to those who made the pots in the first place. Archaeologists know that people around the world have commonly decorated their wares, often perhaps merely because the plastic medium used in their manufacture is so malleable and inviting of experimentation and expressive ornamentation. What makes it seem reasonable to think, nevertheless, that decorated Lapita pots were meaningful in special ways to those who made and used them is more than just that they are so skillfully decorated (Clark 2007). As Kirch (1997: 139-140, 151) and others have reported, these pots differ from most plain Lapita pots in their forms or shapes, as well as in their somewhat flamboyant visual impact. Further- more, judging by some of the contexts of their archaeological recovery (e.g. Bedford et al 2006; Sand et al 1998), it is reasonable to think that such ornate vessels may have been used for particular reasons on particular occasions, perhaps even in particular places. Therefore, as Chiù (2007: 259) asks: 'what made these motifs acceptable and meaningful to Lapita peoples?' In his pioneering collection of essays exploring the design and composition of decorated Lapita vessels, Spriggs (1990a, 1990b: 4) writes without apparent qualification about types of 'anthropomorphic face designs,' and he asks rhetorically whether it is now still possible to figure out what these designs meant to their makers. One could reel off a list of speculative identifications for these faces: deities, chiefs, clan ancestors, and so on' (1990a: 119). He then proceeds to discuss briefly what it would probably take to address these various possibilities directly, leaving the matter open but the reader hopeful. However, in a succinct précis of the same Lapita design study written shortly afterwards and published in 1993, Spriggs adds the important qualification already noted: 'terms such as "human face" or "anthropomorphic face designs" are merely labels of convenience used by the author to describe designs, which may have had totally different meanings to the makers and users of the Lapita pots themselves' (Spriggs 1993: 14, n. 1). He then imme- diately adds that while 'some seemingly more abstract designs may have "meant" the same to Lapita makers and users as the more obvious faces, this is not to suggest that we know what that meaning or those meanings were'. A decade later with greater rhetorical flourish he reiterated this same thought: 'we have attempted to divine its meaning to the people who decorated their pots with its image. But it remains enigmatic. Even if it had a dentate stamped mouth, which it usually does not, it could not speak' (Spriggs 2002: 55). 48 Others have apparently missed the cautionary endnote at the close of his 1993 paper, or they have chosen to ignore his prudence. For instance, Patrick Kirch in his influential On the Road of the Winds reports that 'a large number of the motifs on Lapita bowls, dishes, and other kinds of vessels represent human faces' (2000: 104; original emphasis). He asks: What did these human faces on bowls and dishes signify to the Lapita peoples? Possibly they were representations of ancestors, the vessels functioning within a ritual system or cult of ancestors, as well as constituting objects of reciprocal exchange among related kinship groups ... It is conceivable that the decorated vessels were actually representations of ancestors, and that the act of decorating the pots was analogous to tattooing a human body. (Kirch 2000: 104-5) In spite of his earlier words of caution, Spriggs himself eventually also endorsed the equation advanced by Kirch that Lapita' s seemingly anthropomorphic faces are indeed representations of human beings - in fact, human ancestors - real or imagined: My current view is that ... Lapita represents a new ethnic identity in the western Pacific, forged around a new prestige language (now labeled Proto-Oceanie Austronesian), which was spoken by people of originally disparate geographical and genetic origins. The new language was used to encode powerful origin myths to unite this disparate population, and Lapita pottery designs had an originally important role in the ritual performance of this group's identity ... This new iconography in the material culture, often representing an anthropomorphic face - perhaps the putative ancestor figure? - was an important mobilizing and legitimating force as the Lapita culture was spread from the Bismarcks quickly out into the Pacific ... (Spriggs 2003: 205) Note that in this declaration, Spriggs also equates the meaning of Lapita designs with their social, cultural, and even political importance, an interpretative step we will have more to say about shortly. Other scholars, too, have similarly agreed with Kirch, notably his former graduate student Scarlett Chiù, who has offered richly interpretative readings of Lapita iconography not only as anthropomorphic in character but also strongly iconic in its cultural and socio-political intent (Chiù 2005, 2007: 243). Importance While Spriggs, for one, has acknowledged that the meaning of Lapita motifs may be unknown or even unknowable, their historical importance has never been doubted. In fact, several commentators have gone to considerable length to explain why this is the case. Although the following categories are not mutually exclusive, the putative importance of decorated Lapita sherds can be described under three principal headings: political, religious, and culture-historical Socio-political importance. As Bedford has remarked, 'general consensus amongst researchers regarding the function of decorated Lapita vessels is that they were</page><page sequence="5">associated with ceremonial activities rather than domestic cooking or storage' (Bedford 2006a: 553). The apparent lavishness of Lapita decoration has been taken by some as a sign of how valuable this ware originally must have been, for example, as an exchange item and also as a way to advertise one's individual or family prestige; conversely, the decline and ultimate abandonment of such rich iconography on pots toward the end of what most archaeologists regard as the era of the 'Lapita Cultural Complex' in the South Pacific 'means the collapse not only of Lapita interaction but also of its cultural identity' (Ishimura 2002: 91; also Marshall 2008: 81). In similar fashion, Chiù sees this decorated pottery as 'a new way of presenting social identities in this region more than 3000 years ago' (Chiù 2007: 243). She argues that there are 'social forces of both differentiation and unification' at play in its design diversity (2007: 245). She maintains that adding certain Operators' ('friezes' or complex 'zone markers') to the same basic motif designs was a way of highlighting social differences; and conversely, she says 'forces of social integration can be inferred from face motifs that combine different eye forms' (2007: 256). For example, she proposes that what she calls 'headdress motifs', Spriggs had earlier called 'ear-plugs', and we have identified as stylized representations of markings on the sides of a sea turtle's head or on its body (Terrell and Schechter 2007: 77-78 and figs. 24-26) were status symbols (Chiù 2007: 245, 260). An important suggestion advanced by Chiù, Kirch (1997: 132-140, 188-191), and others is the idea that decorated Lapita pottery was somehow a sign and symbol of the hierarchical structure of Lapita Austronesian society (Chiù 2005: 6, 2007: 245, 257-260). 'The face motifs were employed to signal to outsiders the status and power a house-based group had in its local community, its inherited rights to economic resources, and its intention to manipulate and produce history as new face motifs and histories associated with certain images were being created' (2007: 258; see also: Summerhayes 2007). Additionally, one prominent feature of the interpretations offered by Kirch (1997: 142-144, 188-191) and others has been the idea that the faces on Lapita pots were not only human but were seen at the time as the faces of ancestors. They were, in Chiu's words, tangible 'signs of history.' We can infer, she says, that these pots - or at any rate, the designs put on them - must have been handed down within kin groups (she calls them 'houses') as heirlooms associated with founding ancestors to proclaim the legitimacy of the group's authority and its entitlement to its territory (Chiù 2005: 4). These pots, in other words, evidently were the Lapita equivalent of New Zealand Maori wharenui, or meeting houses (Chiù 2005: 15; Hakiwai and Terrell 1994). Chiù weighs the importance of social marking so strongly that she sees Lapita design variation in itself as having been socially charged, so much so that such variation is only to be expected 'once social systems become more complex, especially when serious social competition among individuals and societies occurs' (2005: 29). Religious importance. Several scholars have suggested that these vessels may have been part of the paraphernalia used in certain sacred or religious rites and activities (e.g. Terrell and Welsch 1997). Most notably, Simon Best (2002: 99) has written that these pots introduce 'a significant religious component' into the archaeologist's Lapita equation. They must have served their makers, he has said, as 'a surface over which to spread messages, information which reinforced the observer's place in both this world and the next' (2002: 99). Furthermore, in Best's estimation, something special happened in the Bismarck Archipelago over three thousand years ago, and these pots were invented as a style at that time to make 'a world full of visible ancestor gods.' What happened? Perhaps a charismatic individual emerged who started a movement or cult that led others on a quest - one might even call it, Best suggests, a crusade - that got people to journey as far out and eastward in the Pacific as Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa. In summary, these potsherds are the archaeological manifestation of a 'great dream' that resulted in the concentration and consolidation of social and religious power in a particular individual or group (2002: 100). Culture-historical importance. There is no need here to revisit how important this pottery has been to reconstructions of Austronesian prehistory (Pawley 2007; Terrell 1990, 1996). Yet if what Best suggests is anywhere near the truth, then it could be argued that what made this pottery what it was - indeed, what led to its inspiration in the first place - may have had little to do with the widely assumed Austronesian heritage of its inventors. After all, such is the nature of revolutions. In this regard, Spriggs has written about Best's interpretations of Lapita thusly: He sees a combination of political and religious reordering occurring in the Bismarcks and leading to the creation of ancestor-god depictions on Lapita pots and their rapid dispersal in a colonizing push out as far a[s] Tonga and Samoa in something less than ten generations. Perhaps an Akhenaten-like individual, a messianic prophet, was responsible for the creation of a new belief system, which completely altered the previous sociopolitical and religious ideologies which had led to the expansion of the Southeast Asian Neolithic from Taiwan out as far as the Bismarcks. (Spriggs 2002: 55) It is often said that anything is possible, but if Spriggs is right, then the possibility must be entertained that what came before Lapita - however Austronesian or otherwise - had no certain and possibly no compelling impact on what happened after the creation of this striking pottery style. Another way of looking at these faces To support inferences that Lapita eyes and faces were meant to be seen as representations of ancestors and that the act of decorating pottery in this fashion was analogous to tattooing the human body, Patrick Kirch has written: 'Admittedly, these hypotheses cannot be 'proved' to the satisfaction of hard-line positivists, but they are certainly reasonable and 49</page><page sequence="6">provide a consistent explanation for the role of the elaborately decorated Lapita ceramics, as well as their transformations over time' (2000: 105). We agree whole- heartedly with Kirch that invoking the principle of consistency, also sometimes referred to as congruence or consilience, can add much to the strength of any argument, whatever its substance, or lack thereof. However, in this case, other interpretations are not only possible but may be more probable for the same reason. Evidence We have several new observations to offer here about Lapita designs and motifs, but before presenting them, some of our previous findings should be summarized for the sake of clarity. Specifically, as we reported in 2007, Lapita iconography exhibits redundancy, synecdoche, and binary complementarity. Redundancy. The repetitiveness of Lapita designs is so obvious on inspection that this style characteristic needs no comment (see, for example: Bedford et al 2007: figs. 8-10). In our earlier paper, however, we noted in addition how this iconography is also redundant. Best and others have distinguished between 'main designs,' 'borders,' and 'fillers' (Best 2002: 50). 'Borders' are what Sand calls instead 'horizontal friezes'. The redundancy of Lapita designs has the effect of visually tying a vessel's main design with its border/frieze designs, and vice versa. Sometimes this redundancy is strikingly apparent: the border/frieze designs may come across visually as basically mini-versions of the main design used (e.g. Bedford et al. 2007: fig. 7). In other cases, simplifications of the main design employed may at first glance obscure the total design's visual redundancy (e.g. Terrell and Schechter 2007: fig. 17). Synecdoche. Many have remarked on the evident simplification of Lapita designs and motifs as time went by and as those making these pots moved farther eastward in the Pacific from somewhere in the Bismarck Archipelago (Best 2002: 54-55; Chiù 2007: 242; Ishimura 2002; Sand 2007: 278-279; Spriggs 1993: 13-14). We agree with Chiù (2007: 244), however, that something more than just a shift over time and space from the complex to the simple was probably going on. Chiù writes that social factors must be taken into account. We would add that so, too, must the probable meaning of this iconography, however elusive this meaning may now be. A synecdoche is a figure of speech in which part of something is used to represent the whole or vice versa, as in the familiar expressions 'be careful, there are ears everywhere' and 'Wisconsin beat Ohio State 47 to 23'. If visual redundancy is as characteristic of Lapita designs as we suspect, then it is likely that it may not have been necessary for potters to use all or even a particular subset of the design elements and motifs available to them to convey to others the intended design 'message' (e.g. Sand 2007: fig. 15). For instance, what we now suspect may be elements representing certain bodily characteristics of the sea turtle (Figure 2) were sometimes used more or less on their own 50 as the principal motif used repetitively in the main design band (e.g. Sand 2007: fig. 15). Said another way, the meaning of the designs on Lapita pots was symbolically less than the sum of its parts. What may look to us to be the evident simplification of a motif over the course of time and space (e.g. Spriggs 1993: 12, fig. 2.15) may be more apparent than real. Simple and complex were seemingly different ways of saying pretty much the same thing, and due to the redundancy of Lapita designs, a design did not need to be one or the other to be seen as meaningful (see: Chiù 2007: 259-260, fig. 7; Sand 2007: figs. 21-23 for numerous and strikingly unambiguous illustrations of the Lapita potter's love of visual synecdoche). Binary complementarity. Something may be said to be complementary to something else in several different ways. A pair of contrasting colors, for example, are said to be complementary when, if combined in suitable proportions, they together produce a neutral color. Then again, something complements something else when it completes or fills out what the other lacks, as in the observation that someone has 'the usual complement of eyes and ears'. In a more formal and restrictive sense, something is said to be a complement when it is one of two mutually completing parts (hence similar to some of the uses of the word counterpart). a:a:a:a: or b:b:b:b: = simple, singular, or exclusive, i.e. lacking a serial or inclusive complement a:b:a:b:a:b:a:b: = serial complements a(b):a(b):a(b):a(b): = inclusive or nested complements a/b I a/b I a/b I a/b = exclusive, layered or hierarchical complements Figure 3. Proposed notation and terminology for classifying the forms of binary complementarity in the structuring of Lapita designs and motifs (adapted from Terrell and Schechter 2007: fig. 18). We reported in our previous paper that the organization or structure of Lapita designs is often complementary in the sense that motifs as a rule contain two somewhat differing elements or motifs paired with one another (Terrell and Schechter 2007: 73). When these elements complement one another within the same band or zone of decoration, they are usually not set off from one another by dividing lines or zone markers (Figure 3). But when the paired elements were used one above the other in separate rows or bands, they were generally separated from one another by an incised line or an impressed band (i.e. what Best calls an 'intervening filler'; Best 2002: 44). We have suggested that these two variant forms of complementarity may be coded as a:b and a/b. A third type of complementarity frequently seen in Lapita motifs is the inclusion or nesting of one element within another, a form we code as a(b). The well-preserved burial pots recently excavated at the</page><page sequence="7">Efate site of Teouma in central Vanuatu offer striking examples of these variant forms of complementarity together with vivid illustration of both the repetitiveness and redundancy of Lapita designs: Bedford et al 2007: fig. 7 = a/b and a(b); figs. 8-9 = a(b); fig. 10 = a(b) as well as inverse a(b); fig. 11 = a(b) and a/b; figs. 12-13 = a(b). Additional observations. Since our 2007 paper, several other findings have been brought forward that are relevant here. 1. We agree with Spriggs (1993: 7-8, 13) that much of the Lapita design corpus should probably be seen as variants on face designs. Based on the recent analytical work of Chiù and Sand discussed above, it now seems probable that most of these designs are variants on the 'long-nose' face, e.g. the lower face in double-face designs (compare Figures 1 and 2). While Sand (2007: 277) acknowledges our 2007 paper, he evidently still considers these motifs to be anthropomorphic: The double face motif is defined by a stylized representation of a human body, with an oval head, a triangular body and extensions figuring the arms. The body is highlighted by a triangular anthropomorphic figure, the whole motif being enclosed in a round-shaped envelope' (Sand 2007: 276). However, given the congruence of the multiple lines of evidence we surveyed in 2007 together with the newly available reconstructions and potsherd illustrations published in particular by Sand and Chiù, Sand's interpretation of this design strikes us as even less probable than we formerly thought. While acknowledging that we, like Sand, are working in an interpretative arena where nothing can be known for certain, we think that the most probable working hypothesis is that most but not all of the faces drawn on Lapita vessels in all five of the typological categories recognized by Chiù (2007) may be variant representations of sea turtles, not human beings. 2. Spriggs (2002: 53) has reported that in the Arawe Islands in the Bismarck Archipelago, for instance, single-face (i.e. long-nose) designs occur mainly on flat-bottomed or shallow open bowls. However, he also notes that some of the potsherds in question may actually come from lids rather than bowls 'unless the faces are meant to be viewed upside down'. As we documented in some detail in 2007, the ethnographic collections at the Field Museum are rich in flat wooden feast platters and shallow bowls from communities along the northern coastline of New Guinea and on small islands immediately offshore. These objects almost invariably have striking designs and naturalistic imagery meticulously carved on their undersides. This ornamentation can be seen only when these platters and bowls are upside down. 3. The single reconstructed flat-bottomed ceramic dish or platter we used to illustrate this distinctive vessel form occasionally found at Lapita sites came from New Caledonia (Terrell and Schechter 2007: fig. 10b). We now know that this particular archaeological specimen is deeper and has more sharply flaring sides than comparable flat ceramic dishes or platters from Lapita sites in the Bismarck Archipelago (Sand 2007: fig. 27). This difference in shape is worth noting, because the known examples from the Bismarcks more closely resemble both ceramic and wooden platters and shallow open bowls in the archaeological and ethnographic collections from northern Papua New Guinea This might seem a minor point perhaps, but it adds further support for our hypothesis that the platters and shallow bowls made in this part of New Guinea are derived historically from Lapita prototypes (Terrell and Schechter 2007: 67-70). 4. While we understand why many might see the upper face in Figure 2 as anthropomorphic, this example is one of only two such two-dimensional representations currently known (Chiù 2007: 247). The only other example that closely resembles these two remarkable double-face specimens comes from the Isle of Pines (Sand 2007: fig. 16). However, this third specimen only has a plain oval shape - not an actual face of any sort - in a/b complementarity over the triangular face in the design field. Therefore, a point worth emphasizing is that there are only two known Lapita sherds with two-dimensional faces on them that seem to look anthropomorphic (which is not to say that they were necessarily meant to be seen as human faces). 5. There are now two other known ceramic specimens that resemble these two extraordinary ones. Both come from shallow flat-bottomed dishes with flaring sides (compare Bedford et al 2007: figs. 12-13 with Chiù 2007: fig. 5). However, the paired faces on both have been drawn next to one another in a:b complementarity, presumably because of the narrowness of the sides of these dishes as a design field,. The plausibly more human-like faces in the design on both dishes have also been drawn upside down, perhaps to fit them successfully into such a narrow design field. What is possibly of significance is the appearance of both types of faces portrayed. One type is of the sort that Chiù calls 'long nose,' and is thus comparable to the lower face in Figure 2. However, the faces of this type on these two dishes lack full triangular framing, again perhaps because there is no space in the design field for that. What seems revealing is that the other type of face in the design on both dishes has the same sort of long nose as the faces of the first type. Furthermore, this second face type has small in-filled triangular markings below the oval eyes that make these faces resemble even more closely the lower face in Figure 2 than the faces on these dishes of the first type. In other words, neither of the two types of faces drawn on these two dishes looks self- evidently anthropomorphic in appearance, even if both are clearly different from one another in some respects. Viewed in conjunction with the well-known specimen shown in Figure 2, the ambiguity of their visual appearance may be hinting that what was being represented graphically is not just someone human riding on the back of a turtle, but perhaps instead or as well the perceived intimacy of the spiritual nexus between turtles and humans being thus alluded to visually in this esoteric manner. 6. As we noted previously, Barry Rolett over two decades ago alerted archaeologists in the Pacific to how prominent turtles are in Oceanic lore and religion. Sea turtles, like the 51</page><page sequence="8">priests who are seen by some in the Pacific as their human counterpart, are able to transcend the boundary between the worlds of the land and the sea (Rolett 1986: 87). Recently Melinda Allen (2007) has reported that while the ethnographic literature is mostly silent on why sea turtles have traditionally been so highly prized in Oceania, the habits of breathing, bleeding, crying, and tenaciously holding on to life exhibited by these animals may have contributed to their important place in Pacific ritual life as well as the frequent restriction of their use to high-ranking individuals. In some places, she notes also, turtles evidently were not only seen as sacred but also as incarnations of deities - and at least in the Marquesas, they were reportedly acceptable as substitutes for human sacrifices. We think it worth considering, therefore, that the evident shape-shifting of the possibly more anthropomorphic faces on these two shallow Lapita dishes (described above) may have been intended as a graphic expression of the intimate parallelism of this sort of spiritual transcendence. 7. Based on our Museum's archival records, personal field work in the Pacific over the past forty years, and what is reported in the ethnographic literature on traditional feasting in such diverse places as the Sepik coast, the Admiralty Islands, Teop Island in the North Solomons, and Samoa, one of our current working hypotheses is that the feast food served in this ornate pottery may have been sago or mashed taro in coconut cream or coconut oil (see also: Clark 2007: 297-297; Torrence and Swadling 2008: 604). Starch granules and raphides identified as possibly from the arqid Colocasia esculenta (taro) have been found on the surfaces of undecorated Lapita potsherds from Anir, New Ireland (Crowther 2005). There is also reason to think that people were making use of this aroid in the southwestern Pacific well before the advent of Lapita pottery (Swadling and Hide 2005). 8. Wai Ambrose (2007) has studied carefully how potters went about decorating Lapita pots, and has now found Figure 4. Green turtle (Chelonia mydas), St. John, Virgin Islands, feeding on sea grasses (© Caroline Rogers; used by permission and not for further reproduction without consent). 52 further reason for thinking that the dentate tools they used may have been made of turtle shell, perhaps from the hawksbill turtle, Eretmochelys imbricate. Like others, Ambrose is impressed by what a laborious task it must have been to create such an extensive corpus of decorative work, often on quite large pottery vessels, using only small curved or straight stamps repetitively. He notes that the ultimate demise not only of Lapita as a design system but also the use of dentate stamping 'may be a deliberate rejection of both the message and its linked medium' (Ambrose 2007: 214). 9. Lastly, we can now offer a plausible interpretation for the rows or lineal arrays of small circular impressions sometimes seen on Lapita decorated vessels (Figure 2 and Bedford et al 2007: figs. 12-13; Chiù 2007: figs 4, 6-8; Sand 2007: figs. 7-8, 11, 16-18, 21). As illustrated here by the Green sea turtle shown in Figure 4, they may be representations of the body marking on such turtles. Meaning As discussed above, one of the unexpected developments of recent years, thanks largely to Chiù and Sand, is the recognition of how coherent and consistent Lapita was as a decorative construction even after acknowledging its genuine variability in time and space (Sand 2007: 284-285). We can now infer that vessels decorated in this fashion were everywhere made to be used in similar ways in similar social contexts for similar reasons. Note our use of the word 'similar', and not 'identical'; there is no need to assume that Lapita was monolithic, uniform, and unchanging. This said, two likely inferences follow from what Chiù and Sand have reported. First, this iconography probably conveyed a similarly coherent and consistent 'message'. Second, if so, then even the seemingly most divergent motifs (e.g. Sand's 'geometric' motifs; Sand 2007: 270-276) may have been visual allusions to the same message, whatever it was, that potters generally used 'eyes', 'noses', and 'faces' to express. This inference does not imply that all designs on Lapita pots are representations, however apparently far-fetched, of anatomical features. As seen in the Aitape sequence on the Sepik coast of Papua New Guinea, for instance, symbols can be changed in type as well as in appearance and yet still be referencing the same or similar messages or meanings (Terrell and Schechter 2007: 81, fig. 27). As noted earlier, Best has vigorously advanced the claim that Lapita designs were religious in character (Best 2002: 10, 62ff). In his own words, 'that Lapita decoration in the east had at its most complex a religious aspect associated with some kind of centralized social system, and with a cosmology that changed little since the initial start from the homeland in the west is certain' (2002: 63). Our own work lends some support for this view. The observed redundancy and complementarity of Lapita motifs may have been ways of affirming a complex of ideas focused strongly but perhaps not exclusively on the sea, sea turtles, and culturally (and probably emotionally) significant allusions to a popular</page><page sequence="9">legend, myth, or narrative about a person who rode on the if it is possible to 'comprehend the social characteristics back of a sea turtle (Terrell and Schechter 2007: 79-80). inherent in these Lapita face motifs' (Chiù 2007: 243; also: Along with Best, we suspect that the redundancy and Clark 2007). complementarity of Lapita motifs were more than artistic Λ „π Ί . , , . . , .. * η * * . _ - , . . r - . ^ Λ Λ 2. „π While Ί variable . , , in . time . and , space, it .. is not farfetched * η * * to conventions. . _ Both - characteristics , . . of r this - . art ^ were also Λ , ,. . . , . , . ., j.

To those new to it, this technology must have seemed Importance revolutionary in itself.

Like Best, Marshall sees Lapita as the sign and «pression to social roles, relationships, and actions would symbol of a period of significant social, political, and necessarily have had similarly disruptive and destructive presumably religious change in the prehistoric Pacific outcomes. heralding 'an event, a moment in which a new forum for 4. it would seem likely that once they had been introduced social action was being formulated' (Marshall 2008: 65). to the technological skills of pottery making, people in the She suggests that decorated Lapita pottery may have even Pacific saw this technology as a new and powerful way of been used by some as a kind of 'a Trojan horse' to exploit expressing what was already important to them - which social and political weaknesses of the moment, weaknesses may explain why from the archaeologist's perspective generated 'by the twin processes of migration and Lapita suddenly bursts on to the stage of Pacific prehistory colonization' that had kept the ancestors of Lapita people on unannounced (Ambrose 2007: 214; Torrence and Swadling the move for some time (Marshall 2008: 72-73, 79-81). 2OO8). As Chiù (2007: 243) writes: 'these face motifs 'From the Bismarck Archipelago to New Caledonia represent a new way of presenting social identities in this inscribed Lapita was a key agent in a social order which region more than 3000 years ago', promoted and valorized colonization.

It is fascinating to speculate on how this craft was Further: introduced. Did it come as part of the dowry, so to speak, Lapita pottery with human face motifs is thus brought by foreign wives, as one might take the molecular hypothesized to be a category of house heirlooms that genetics of Pacific Islanders to be telling us (Kayser et al. were used not only to differentiate house and social 2008)? Or did it arrive, say, with traders and their families status, but also as a symbol of unity between houses or (LiUey 1999)?

From our own just a matter of moving on beyond the previously settled perspective, the following set of propositions is more than confines of the western Pacific in search of new enough to take us to a point where Lapita not only makes opportunities (perhaps even in search of beaches with sense to us, but does so in less than revolutionary terms. abundant turtles?; see Bedford 2006b: 258; Burley 1999). 1. Material objects can have social meanings as well as 8. We think that currently popular suggestions about why social uses. We agree with Chiù that it is worthwhile to see Lapita was important, focusing our attention as they do on 53</page><page sequence="10">social life, social hierarchies, and the machinations of survival, do not give sufficient consideration to what Best has highlighted impressively: people do not just use material things to mediate human relationships; they also use things to link themselves with realms of being that are otherwise intangible, spiritual, sacred, and the like. Best (2002: 99) has phrased it well: those seizing upon this craft as a new form of expression were in all likelihood not just acting like artists in our current understandings of the term and status, but instead saw in this exciting new medium a powerful 'surface over which to spread messages, information which reinforced the observer's place in both this world and the next'. Conclusions Faces, yes. But human faces only? Not likely. A revolution? We think there are better words to use. We are now even more convinced than formerly that the two-dimensional iconography found on decorated Lapita vessels features the sea turtle, and we are again persuaded by the evidence available that this iconography was a way of alluding to ideas, social values, and sacred concepts linking sea turtles with human beings - in short, it was not just about sea turtles as creatures but as something more metaphorically charged. As Joshua Bell said recently about the Purari Delta of Papua New Guinea: in a world populated by various seen and unseen entities that have agency, nothing that one encounters may be what at first it seems to be (Bell 2008: 126). Oral accounts heard in different parts of the Pacific frequently include allusions to sea turtles, but unfortunately the written record of these accounts is discouragingly patchy. It may never be possible to discern what was being said about them in this esoteric fashion by Lapita potters 3000 and more years ago, although there are promising clues (e.g. Terrell and Schechter 2007: 82-83). Nonetheless, we think the hypothesis must be entertained that the art of pottery making - newly introduced to a community or communities in the Bismarck Archipelago sometime in the middle of the 2nd millennium BC - was eagerly seized upon by some both there and later elsewhere in the southwestern Pacific as a new (and fashionable) way to express ideas, sentiments, and the like that had not only been long held to be meaningful, but which were also seen by people then as key to sociality and the rituals of life (see: Clark 2007). We think, too, that it is time to acknowledge that the spiritual life of the ancient Pacific Islanders was far richer and impressive in its religious allusions, symbols, metaphors, and insights than colorless old phrases like 'ancestor gods' and 'ancestor cults' can lead us to see and comprehend.
