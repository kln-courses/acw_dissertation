<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-DISCUSSION. MR. F. H. BRADLEY'S ANALYSIS OF MIND. By JAMES WARD. IN the last number of MIND (pp. 354 ff.), Mr. Bradley has further expounded those views of his concerning general psychology which I had occasion to criticise incidentally in the number but one previous. The main purpose of my article was to exhibit certain imperfections of psychological terminology. For this imperfection, I conceived, the subject-matter of the science is to blame rather than its exponents, and I was fully sensible of the truth of Prof. Bain's remark, that "Iit will be long ere we attain an unimpeachable phraseology for the highest generalities of mind". Still it seems always worth while to see what is faulty in our work even if we cannot straightway correct it. I ventured accordingly to institute a comparison between the logical exactness of physical definitions and the "I varying use of terms involving incompatible implications and the surreptitious changes of standpoint that mark even the clearest psychological writing ". It was in this connexion that I came across Mr. Bradley's article on " Attention" in MIND No. 43. It was not within my purpose to discuss his views in detail: my contention as regards him was merely that his fundamental conceptions and his method were false; and in venturing now to remark further upon these as they appear in his last article, I do not purpose to touch one way or other on its main theme-the psychological genesis of Thought. Mr. Bradley's main position, as I understand it, may be stated thus:-All psychical facts are presentations, and,-symbolising presentations as a, b, c,-the laws of psychology are the laws of the interaction of such a, b, c, that is, of their differentiations, conjunctions, conflicts, fusions, associations and so forth. All that is covered by the terms Consciousness or Mind is resolvable into various combinations or relations of these psychical a, b, c: as there is no water till oxygen and hydrogen combine as H20, so there is no self or subject and no activity till the interactions of presentations "generate" the appropriate "groups ". Mr. Brad- ley does not merely say: The subject at the beginning does not know itself-a statement which perhaps no one would question. What he says is: There is nothing but feeling there. Out of an originally undifferentiated x arise in accordance with psychical laws the subject, objects and activity, which others maintain are implied in the very conception of psychical existence, and which, they hold, must be thought by the psychologist in de-</page><page sequence="2">MR. F. H. BRADLEY S ANALYSIS OF MIND. 565 scribing' the individual's development, notwithstanding,that the individual himself has no such presentations at the outset. One reason given for excluding these conceptions from psycho- logy is, that they are neither facts nor laws, but " rags of meta- physics," and " we have in science to do solely with events and their laws ". Now if this objection had been urged by some of our excellent friends the physiologists, I should probably admit it at once: they are making valuable contributions to the super- structure of psychology, and it is best not to put them out of conceit with us by raising difficulties, the force of which they would not feel. But with a, writer who has given to the world a book on the principles of knowledge it is otherwise. Accordingly I venture to request that writer to consider and to explain to us what he understands by " doing in science "; and in 'the mean- time confess that I have assumed that science deals with facts only by means of ideas. Brute facts will never make a science of themselves, and we cannot get ideas out of them till we have put ideas in. Further, when the physiologists (for whose superior ability and surpassing devotion, by the way, Mr. Bradley has extraordinary respect) talk of rags of metaphysics, we know what they mean, and take their rebukes meekly. But from a philosopher we reasonably look for more precision. It is one thing to keep science clear of ontological speculations; it is quite another to refuse to give adequate definitions of conceptions that have various implications within science itself. The first procedure is wise and sober; the second is slovenly and confusing. We may be quite sure the first is what Mr. Bradley intends; but then comes the question: How are we to ascertain the concep- tions that for psychology are simple and ultimate ? So far as I can see, Mr. Bradley does not tell us. My own view was that those conceptions, and those only, are ultimate for a particular science, whether actually so or not, which, like compound radi- cals in organic chemistry, so to say, never require analysis within the science itself. Tried by this test, Mr. Bradley's "working definitions" prove insufficient. In all other sciences the term 'phenomenon' and its equiva- lents may b1e used without more ado: in psychology they cannot. Now, Mr. Bradley talks of presentations as if they were. simply phenomena: he proposes to " take ' given' or ' presented' not as implying a donation or even a relation to an Ego, but rather for that which is simply" (p. 364,fin.). This is all very well when we are busied with the external world; for, though it is obvious that given and presented always inmply donation or relation, yet the term implied can be neglected when we are talking of sounds, or colours, or storms, or trees; they are there for anybody and everybody, for nobody in particular. When, therefore, we speak of ' chemical' phenomena or ' astronomical' phenomena, it is only to distinguish one kind of phenomena from another. But</page><page sequence="3">566 W. WARD: 'psychical' does not qualify phenomenon simply in this sense. A psychical event is not a mere a as distinct from a chemical event which is a b, or an electrical which is a c; for b and c become psychical events so soon as we regard them as part of the ex- perience of a particular M or N. This is a point that seems past all disputing, as even Mr. Bradley's own language may serve to show. Pyschology occupies what I have called the individual- istic standpoint,-not by way of excluding metaphysics, as Mr. Bradley supposes, nor by choice at all, but of necessity, in order to be psychology. And this necessity asserts itself, I say, in Mr. Bradley's definition of his events as " the facts immediately experienced within a single soul or organism". " 'Experience,"' he adds, " is not definable: it can only be indicated." Very good;- let it be indicated. To what will Mr. Bradley direct us ? Will he say: ' The sun shines, Honey is sweet: these are facts, are experience'? Is it not obvious that he will say: ' You see or feel the sunshine; That bee tastes the honey-sweet, or the like'? In other words, " imnmediate experience within a single soul or organism" is not a or b, sunlight or honey-sweet simply, but a or b as they are for some sentient, percipient or intelligent sub- ject. I have endeavoured to express this symbolically by saying that the psychical fact is Spa -or Spb or generally Spo. The difference in question is recognised in the old scholastic distinction of esse reale and esse it7entionale, and more ambiguously in the modern one of subjective and objective. Half the problems of philosophy spring from this difference, and if it could be resolved into a, difference of phenomena we should have heard the last of such problems long ago. It may be that the difficulties which have so often driven speculation from idealism to realism, and from realism back to idealism, may never be resolved; but this is lno warrant for trying to suppress a distinction which is, so to speak, in the nature of things. I have never said that psychologists should be idealists as metaphysicians; but that they do and must occupy an idealist standpoint in scientifically expounding the facts of mind, just as the physicist does and must occupy a) realist standpoint in treating scientifically of the facts of matter. It is the endeavour to transcend this dualism, not the frank recognition of it, that is really an intrusion of speculation into science. X - Within that important department of psychology occupied with the quality, duration and intensity of presentations, or with their interactions-" the machinery," as Mr. Bradley calls it-it is often convenient to regard a presentation as a, or b, or c. But before we have done with psychical facts, we have to take account of what is meant by "immediate experience". Whether or no they can settle " the amount of continuity and ideal identity required to make a single soul," Mr. Bradley, and psychologists too, have to admit, tacitly at least, -that presentation implies con- sciousness, and that consciousness implies a subject and activity.</page><page sequence="4">MR. F. H. BRADLEY S ANALYSIS OF MIND. 567 Herbart, who may be said to have suppressed the old tripartite classification into cognitions, emotions, volitions, only made the more prominent the distinction between the vorstellende Seele and its Vorstellungen. Our English Associationists again, with whom Mr. Bradley is anxious to make his peace, have allowed full weight to the old classification, though they have refrained from emphasising the implication of a subject which it contains. Mr. Bradley alone would sweep away both entirely, believing that what might be called Presentationism will suffice; and for him, it is to be noted, a presentation is supposed to imply no relation to a subject but is " that which is simply and comes as it is ". This position is so little in keeping with Mr. Bradley's general theory of method that one is almost tempted to regard it as a wilful tour de force. Thus in one place he says: " The absolute truth in the light of metaphysics, because it will not work, must not be let in ". On the other hand, to those who brand a useful assumption as falsehood he replies: " If a fiction, it deals with the facts. Let psychology mind its own business." 1 Why should not this language be used of the conscious subject, which, whether fact or fiction itself, certainly works and enables psychology to know its own business? Nothing would have seemed more natural for Mr. Bradley, with his views of working defini- tions and useful hypotheses, than to say: ' The conception of a subject, soul or self, that is aware of what is presented, receives what is given, and either seeks or avoids, according as it feels pleased or pained-this universal postulate of common-sense may be a fiction, but it deals with the facts: debar me from its use, and I must talk of psychical processes as I might of fermen- tation or electrolysis. Whether individual minds are modes of one Infinite Mind; whether their individuality is one of form and. has varying real constituents; whether the mind that I am for myself is matter for everybody beside; whether the energy of the- physicist is but another aspect of what the psychologist calls will, and the law of least resistance another side of pleasure and pain- whether propositions like these or their opposites are true in the light of absolute metaphysics, is entirely outside empirical psycho- logy. The assumption of a conscious subject as a working con- ception can be kept clear of such questions just as the conceptions of substance or cause can be kept clear of analogous speculative difficulties. "If we do not define by the organism," i.e., help ourselves out with scraps of physiology, " we must use the word soul or mind;" and if we are to avoid "rags of metaphysics," such as talking of "what is simply and comes as it is," we must define the soul as "a totality of immediate experience ". And it must be plain to all but "barbarians" that such a continuous I Soberly put, this is very nmuch my own position. I have developed it at more length in an article eintitled "A General Analysis of Mind," in' The Journal of Speculative Philosophy for 1882, pp. 368-370.</page><page sequence="5">t68 J. WARD: identical totality is not a mere sum or series of experiences, a, b, c, d; but that, contrariwise, these experiences only become a whole when regarded as the experiences of one to whom pertains whatever activity experience implies.' However, we must take Mr. Bradley as we find him, and he refuses to distinguish psychi- cal facts from others by the characteristic of subjectivity. Passing from the definition of psychology to psychology itself, Mr. Bradley maintains that the relation of subject and object is not essential. The properly psychological reasons given for this call for special consideration. It is urged, "in the first place, that in verifiable experience we occasionally have states where this relation of subject and object wholly ceases to exist ". But the main point is put in the following questions, which Mr. Brad- ley asks to have' fairly met :-" Where experience does give us a reference to self . . that self has always a content. . . . If this reference exists at the start, what is the content of the subject? Is it likely that experience, at its poor and blurred beginning, does divide itself into two parts with a relation between them; 'and if so, what fills each part, and what machinery can at once effect this distinction?" (P. 365, fin.) An answer to these ques- tions sufficient to rebut Mr. Bradley's main objection is not, I think, difficult, and shall be attempted presently; but, in fact, these questions are only formidable on account of the preposterous misconception, as it appears to me, on which they rest. In de- fining psychology, Mr. Bradley identified presentation with exist- ence simply: he now identifies existence with mere presentation. Accordingly there is no self or subject except where there is self- consciousness and so long as there is self-consciousness. ' Once upon a time there was Nobody and Nothing; but after several adventures Nobody received sundry interesting presents, and picked out several things, albeit he remained Nobody still. By and by, however, thanks to their strange collisions, there somehow supervened a mirror, and then Nobody managed to distinguish himself, and was Nobody no more.' A philosophic little romance in this style seems to be at the bottom of Mr. Bradley's assump- tions. Before answering his questions, therefore, I should have to ask him if he admitted the distinction of (1) self as existing, ,or, if he prefers it, self as knowing self, and (2) self as known by self; and'I should have to ask him again if he admitted that terms such as Presentation, Experience, &amp;c. (which we may sym- bolise by 0), are necessarily relative to something else (which we may symbolise by S). If he denied these distinctions, I should ask him, without them, to make but one of his clauses clear-viz., "Where experience does give us a reference to self ". If he allowed them, I think his first point would be sufficiently disposed of by saying that it simply meant:-We are not always self-con- scious; " a reference to self" is not an invariable portion of what is given us. Turning to his "main point," I should ask leave to call his attention to a remark I ventured to urge upon his notice</page><page sequence="6">MR. F. H. BRADLEY S ANALYSIS OF MIND. 569 before (No. 45, p. 62), viz., that a machine is not itself a motive power. Then, if he rejected the distinctions just mentioned, I should ask him to explain how he conceives the relation of ex- perience, whether poor or rich, that is no one's experience to the machinery that divides it into somebody and what somebody experiences. If he accepted these distinctions, I should propose to recast the question, which, as it stands, is ambiguous. " What is the content of the subject at the start?" I should take to refer to the psychologist's conception of the subject as esse reale, and I should reply: The subject is, at first as always, that which lives, which thinks and feels and acts, which attends to and is pleased or pained by its sensations and movements. The question: By what machinery does experience at the beginning divide itself into two related parts, subjective and objective ? would also require emendation. Experience does not divide itself, but is so divided because of the interest of the subject in certain presentations and in certain relations of presentations. If we could imagine a subject incapable of pleasure or pain, but otherwise passing through the same ex- periences as ourselves and provided with the same machinery of " regularities, redintegration, blending," &amp;c., it is difficult to see how the differentiation of subject-experience and object-experi- ence could ever begin. How it has begun and developed for a subject that feels and that acts under the prompting of feeling is a question Mr. Bradley deals with himself (pp. 368 ff.). Here in the main we agree,' except of course that Mr. Bradley thinks he has disencumbered himself of the difference between the esse reale and esse intentionale of the subject. But where this diffe- rence is itself in question, to argue that at the outset there is no subject because " for the soul" there is then no distinction of self and not-self, might be characterised as Ignoratio Elenchi, Contradictio in Adjecto, or Petitio Princ?pii, according to the reader's taste. In keeping with this rejection of a subject that acts and feels is Mr. Bradley's further doctrine that activity, as well as feeling, is a mere presentation. Wundt's theory of apperception he holds beneath contempt, and the present use of the term " activity " is, he insists, "little better than a scandal and a main obstacle in the path of English psychology ". I should have thought the chief obstacle in the way of English psychology had been its neglect of psychical activity, and the chief merit of psychology in Germany had been essentially that very doctrine of appercep- tion which, as developed by Wundt, Mr. Bradley is loath to criticise. He demands a definition of activity, and offers one of his own. For my part, I doubt if activity can be defined in terms that do not already imnply it. Mr. Bradley's definition (p. 371 fin.) is so far from clear to me that I am driven to suspect some 'Cp. Ency. Brit., art. " Psychology," pp. 84 ff. 37</page><page sequence="7">570 J. WARD: clerical error. What we mean generally when we use 'activity' is, he thinks, "an alteration of A not taken as belonging to anything outside, but as a change of soinething beyond A which realises something which in A was ideal." From this " general idea" of activity " we come to the soul and the perception of our own activity," and. naturally expect the general idea will now be rendered more definite. But not one word does Mr. Bradley tell us of the meaning of psychical activity; there is only the old aimless contention that the soul cannot be conscious of the activity implied in consciousness without some apprehension of a concrete self, &amp;c.; in other words, that psychical life cannot begin with reflection. "The minimum that must be apprehended " is " a concrete and limited self-group, and a following alteration of this as against its liinit ". It must surely be plain to everybody but Mr. Bradley that the apprehension of this mininmum is itself an action, and none the less distinct from the said minimum because the act is that of apprehending an act. But Mr. Bradley is evidently equal to the feat of moving the world without a 7rovi oCrT: to get into a basket and carry himself would be nothing to a philosopher who resolves himself into his own presentations. If Mr. Bradley had made clear to us what we are to understand by " apprehended" in the passage quoted, he would have done more to remove the scandal of which he complains. If he were now seriously to attempt this, he might find the obstacle not so much disgraceful as ultimate and insuperable. Certain differences between one kind of activity and another may be known: we may distinguish, e.g., thinking from moving, recollecting from expecting; so far, that is, as they are differences in presentations or in their inter- actions. But the common fact in all-which I have called, perhaps miscalled, Attention-cannot be known per se; for it is neither a presentation, nor a relation among presentations, nor, strictly speaking, an unanalysable element in the presentations themselves. An unanalysable element in every complete state of mind it is, I admit, but one which even in reflective consciousness is not directly presented. I see no very serious objection to saying that all that we know about it is an "intellectual construction," or an interpretation, or even an inference, provided it be allowed that every ploposition in psychology when completely explicated becomes nonsense if this " inference " is rejected. I allow further not only that it is a most difficult problem for psychology to ascertain how such " intellectual construction " as a state of mind has arisen, but also that it is entirely a question for epistemology to determine finally its validity as knotledge. But if science is to precede philosophy and to furnish its material, then empirical psychology, in order " to deal with its facts," will have to recognise, and always does recognise, that unanalysable element I mean by attention or psychical activity. It will have also to distinguish, and, in fact, always does distinguish, this attention</page><page sequence="8">MR. F. H. BRADLEY S ANALYSIS OF MIND. 571 from its objects, the presentations attended to. Other terms may be used-thought, sentience, consciousness: this unanalysable activity may be confounded with its object, as was done by the faculty-psychologists with their powers of perception, conception, and what not; but the activity is there all the same. But if it is unanalysable, why call it activity rather than any- thing else ? asks Mr. Bradley. This question implies that activity has a meaning apart -from psychical activity, and such is, as we have seen, Mr. Bradley's opinion. The contrary, I should have thought, was nearer the truth: all terms implying action as distinct from mere happening are commonly regarded as anthropomorphic. That is to say, this unanalysable psychical ele- ment is taken as the type and source of all other conceptions of activity: they involve it, it does not involve them. It is quite true, however, that the currenat conception of activity is derived from the " active process " rather than from the intellectual, and it is in every way reasonable to ask whether there really is activity in both, and a common activity. But I have already dealt with this question (No. 45, pp. 58-61). Mr. Bradley has still an objection: Suppose your analysis admitted, and that all psychical activity is fundamentally one- attention to presentations; still you have only substituted one faculty for several; "the vice of admitting faculties is there all the same ". In the first place this is a serious over-statement: it would be a very real gain to psychology if its facts could be so far simplified, a gain comparable to the simplification in physics obtained by the modern conception of energy. Mr. Bradley might as well cavil with this because it still uses the term force. But further, the vice denounced is not chargeable against the analysis I am defending. It is not proposed to explain psychical facts by assuming a faculty beyond them. All that is meant is that in every psychical fact there is a subject attending; not that beyond these acts of attending there is a potential attentioll. The subject is not regarded as merely capable of attention and as attending, when it chances to attend, by means of an appropriate faculty; but it only is an actual subject as it actually attends. Mr. Sully and Prof. Wundt can speak for themselves if they think it worth while; but for myself I entirely repudiate Mr. Bradley's account of my views. Nothing so fatuous as confounding an analysis with an explanation is fairly chargeable against me. I might as well accuse Mr. Bradley of mythology because he talks of the laws of Contiguity and Blending as working thus and thus. In my remarks (No. 45, pp. 66 ff.) on Mr. Bradley's earlier article (in No. 43), I tried to show that the account he gave of the origin of the conception of activity confirmed, in spite of him, the analysis he was seeking to overthrow. Mr. Bradley has modified this account in one important particular, but excuses himself from entering further into my criticisms, because he</page><page sequence="9">572 J. WARD: loqks to his last article (in No. 47) to clear up what he thinks I misunderstood before. That I do not understand Mr. Brad- ley's analysis I fully admit; but I do not believe I have so completely misunderstood it as to exclude my remarks from all claim to consideration. However, as the point is impor- tant, I will try, now that I have compared both articles, to restate the particular objection more clearly. Mr. Bradley is showing how the idea of activity originates. It is brought out of a certain basis by means of a certain machinery. Of this basis it is hard to get a clear account. On p. 365 it is " a whole that expands and contracts, and feels pleasure and pain ". On p. 367 it is "a whole given without relations [' given' we must remember = ' is simply'] and given therefore as one with its own pleasure and pain ". On the former page we are told that pleasure and pain are presentations, and on the latter that " presentation has two sides, sensation and pleasure and pain ". In the account of the machinery there is a like con- fusion. After describing the working of association in the " imn- proved " form, Mr. Bradley continues: " Turning now from these conditions to one not mechanical, though hardly ideal, we reach the influence of pleasure and pain. That these work seems certain, but the way . . . is still matter of controversy, and I shall pass it by ! " Now, it makes all the difference in the world whether pleasure and pain, like intensity, duration, &amp;c., are sides or aspects of every presentation, or pertain only to the whole that expands and contracts and which is said to feel. Further, if pleasure and pain work in a way not mechanical, we ought surely to have some general notion what this way is, especially if they belong to the whole that feels, rather than to the elements that struggle about company, and whose collisions are said to "ccause pain and unrest" (p. 360). However, in spite of this initial obscurity, Mr. Bradley's exposition will be more lucid as we -go on. Certain sensations, which continue to be one with pleasure and pain, become closely united into a " feeling-mass ": from this the other groups in which the feeling-aspects have been loosened by repeated collisions become dissociated and contrasted. Supposing the primitive correlated whole resolvable into I and 0 (inner and outer), we may say then that we have now I + F set over against 0 - F, the group that has kept its feeling-aspect and the rest that have lost theirs. And now the idea of activity is about to emerge. But let us, to be sure there is no conjuring, note, once more: (1) that the only materials are I + F (or some presentations it may contain) and 0 - F (with, in like manner, its latent differentiations}; (2) that these and their constituents are ever struggling towards an independent totality, this striving of every mental element being the only active principle that is even tacitly admitted; and (3) that the laws of its working (coalescence, redintegration, &amp;c.) are the machinery we are expected to under- stand. It is altogether a singular inventory for a psychologist-</page><page sequence="10">MR. F. H. BRADLEY S ANALYSIS OF MIND. 573 whose first fiat was, " Atomism must go wholly," and who feels at liberty to denounce Herbart's " audacious assumptions and com- plicated fictions". But to proceed. Since I + F and 0 - F are all the presentations there are, we naturally expect the con- stituents of activity to be found among them; and so, we are told, -they will be if we assume that I + F "is perpetually growing larger or smaller as against other elements [0 - F], and . . . that the expansion gives in general a feeling of pleasure, while contrac- tion brings pain". Having " assumed all this and passed over the difficulties which of cotirse beset it," we learn next and last that " this expansion of our area beginning from within gives a certain feeling, and it is interpreted as a putting forth of a something from out the self into the not-self-the something being [named] energy or force or will . . . in fact, of course, being nothing at all" (No. 43, p. 320). In his first article Mr. Bradley was of opinion that there must be an idea of the expansion and that " this idea, or end, must lead to the change ". But he now thinks this was perhaps going too far: all that seems really necessary is " a concrete and limited self-group, and a following alteration of this as against its limit" (No. 47, p. 372). Mr. Bradley is fond of metaphors, and sometimes warns us that his terlmls are not to be strictly taken. Unhappily he has not elucidated what he intends by the expansion of a group of presentations against its limit, or by the seemingly superfluous qualification that the expansion begins from within. The group I + F might increase in intensity; but such an expansion could not be said in general to give or " to be connected with " pleasure, especially if bodily sensations are a main constituent. This group might also increase by means of fusion and redintegration, form- ing "a whole possessed throughout of such a content that it suggests nothing out of harmony with anything else" (p. 360); and when this does happen, Mr. Bradley has already told us pain and unrest cease. But let the reader think of any such case of simplification, identification, recognition or the like, and say what there is in it-I ought not say to " give " or to " suggest " but-to be a certain feeling possibly interpretable as a putting forth of something from out of the redintegrating group into another. Nay, I would ask him to consider what possible meaning can be given to such " a putting forth " so long as we exclude everything but presentations and their interactions. For my own part I not only fail to understand Mr. Bradley's natural history of the idea of activity except by admitting elements which he most ewiphati- cally excludes, but, giving up the attempt to understand it, I can- not even imagine the state of mind to which his description applies-viz., that it is an " expansion" which in general " gives" pleasure, and at the same time " gives" a feeling interpretable as energy, force or will. Pleasurable " expansions " are frequently passive, and "expansions," interpretable as exertions of force or energy against a limit, as frequently painful. Moreover we often</page><page sequence="11">574 J. WARD: enough have a feeling so interpreted when the self-group con- tracts instead of expanding. To me Mr. Bradley's exposition in detail reads like an unintentional travesty of Herbartian psycho- logy by one who has tried to improve upon it without being at the pains to master it. But the objections I urged before are independent of its details and are not removed by the omission of all reference to final cause, to desire, or to the distinction of real and ideal. Much as Mr. Bradley strives to get all his facts into the one plane of presenta- tion, his language continually shows that he has to admit other facts outside that plane. But the consequences of this admission seem to me hidden from him by the ambiguities of the words " feeling " and " given ". Perhaps, too, that ' slippery word' rela- tion, as Professor James happily termed it, must bear a good deal of tbe blame. What is " given " is sometimes what there is for the psychologist, and sometimes what there is presented for the sub- ject whose states of' mind the psychologist describes: Mr. Bradley seems never to know which of these two standpoints he is occupy- ing. As to "feeling," a collation of passages would show that with Mr. Bradley as with the rest of mankind pleasure or pain is not anything in itself. Neither is it an attribute of presentation com- -parable with intensity, duration and quality, or else it would be as much a contradiction to talk of presentations that had lost their feeling-aspect as it would be to talk of presentations that were minus intensity, duration or quality. From the whole that feels, however, feeling cannot be separated. So far from being presenta- tions, pleasure and pain are rather the effects of presentations on this self, "brought " or " given " to it by them. This absolute and invariable subjective implication of the word feeling cannot be dis- posed of by callilng feelings presentations, so long as it is true that all other presentations have or attain objective implications, and feeling proper never does. And it is because of this subjective implication of the word that what is interpreted as energy or will Mr. Bradley, as it were instinctively, calls feeling too. This fact also is outside the plane of presentation proper. Everybody would see at once that to refer the origin of the idea of activity to an expansion that was only presented would be almost a contra- diction: when the expansion is said to "begin from within and to give a certain feeling, &amp;c.," it is not so evident that only presenta- tation is meant, and that the order of events is first the expansion and then the feeling of effort! But, as just said, the word "relation" it is, I suspect, which has served Mr. Bradley the worst. A writer who essays to settle the fundamentals of a sc-ience like psychology, and in particular to exhibit the analysis and genesis of such a conception as activity, had need be very careful with this word "relation". But it never gives Mr. Bradley a moment's pause. Psychology is concerned only with certain facts, "regarded merely as events which happen," and these facts are presentations or " relations existing between "</page><page sequence="12">MR. F. H. BRADLEY S ANALYSIS OF MIND. 575 presentations.' Now it seems to me that some reflection might have shown Mr. Bradley that relations are not generally events -that of subject and object is not-and that relations between presentations often do not " exist " (i.e., are not given) till they are made. So far from .activity being resolvable into a relation between presentations, it is not possible, I maintain, to explain the psychological relations of presentations except we start from psychical activity. I cannot do better in this connexion than quote a passage Mr. Bradley has himself cited: "In the very lowest stage of psychical existence we can still point to a central activity, and verify there a rudiment of inference. And a soul, so far as we are able to see, would be no soul at all if it had not this centre." 2 "An inference," this same writer elsewhere ex- plains, "cannot wholly come in from without or be passively received." Between inferring and relating, it need hardly be said, there is more than an etymological connexion. To sum up: In spite of his great astuteness and ability, Mr. Brad- ley has, it seems to me, involved himself in inconsistency and con- fusion, because he has not merely forsworn all speculation, but repudiated also the fundamental conceptions from which specu- lation starts: his procedure is much like bleeding yourself to death to guard against blood-poisoning. A cursory survey of knowledge discloses two limits-what is beyond our reach and what is too near to reach. The nearer limit only affects psy- chology, and Mr. Bradley, in essaying to treat psychology as a natural science, has ignored this peculiarity: because he can't see his own eyes, he seems to think he must say he hasn't any. He denies activity to mind as a whole, but allows its elements to struggle towards an independent totality. Out of this psychical machinery he tries to develop its own presuppositions, and smuggles into it what is really distinct from it and is its only motive-power. The plausibility and the hopelessness of such a task suggests a certain parallel to the old dreams of perpetual motion. ' Mr. Bradley, supposing me to have said that acti4ity contains a relation, invites me to say, further, whether the terms of the relation are presentations,; or, if not that, what else they are-as if no other possibility were conceivable. All I meant was that an act of attention may be simple and original, albeit the conception of it is composite and derivative, not possible till we have first acquired the ideas of a self and a not-self, and got to know that changes in the latter ensue upon modes of the former -a point irrelevant enough to the main question, on which Mr. Bradley keeps insisting still. 2 Principles of Logic, ? 3, p. 456.</page></plain_text>
