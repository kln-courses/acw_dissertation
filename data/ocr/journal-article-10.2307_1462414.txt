New York: Edwin Mellen Press, 1977. vii+182 pages, notes, bibliography, indices. N.P. ISBN 0- 88946-985-7. Although the Aristotelian elements in Clement's writing did not receive the same amount of attention as, e.g., his Platonic sources, they did not go un- noticed. Insofar as the present monograph carefully collects these elements and reviews the relevant scholarship, it provides a useful service, but it does not break new ground. The originality of the work consists in showing how these elements were used by Clement in refuting the Gnostics. After an introductory chapter reviewing the state of the question, four chapters investigate the main points where Aristotelian themes and (at least mediately) texts have helped Clement to refute Gnostic doctrines. Thus, chapter 2 shows how Clement used Aristotelian arguments in according to "faith" (pistis) a higher status than either Plato or the Gnostics. Chapter 3</page><page sequence="2">Book Notices 519 indicates how the Aristotelian teaching on virtue as a mean helped Clement to oppose both of the extremes associated with Gnosticism: the radical rejection of matter and the total liberation from the fetters of conventional morality. Chapter 4 investigates the Aristotelian contribution to Clement's defense of the freedom of the will against what he considered to be the Gnostic doctrine of salvation or damnation "by nature." Finally, chapter 5 examines the Aristo- telian elements in Clement's doctrines of God and the Logos, though these elements serve here more as a refutation of the anthropomorphic views of simple believers than as the teachings of the Gnostics. A brief conclusion (chapter 6) summarizes the results of the preceding investigations. Three appendices, a bibliography, and careful indices enhance the value of the volume. The image of Clement as a Christian thinker emerging from this book is (in this reviewer's judgment, rightly) closer to Irenaeus and more remote from Gnosticism than, e.g., that given by the influential monograph of S. Lilla. The author's approach could be questioned in the tendency to consider "Aristo- telian" elements as existing by themselves, rather than considering whether and to what extent they may have been (together with Stoic ones) absorbed by that broad stream of Middle Platonism to which J. Dillon's recent book (The Middle Platonists: 80 B.C. to A.D. 220, 1977) has so forcefully called our attention. David L. Balas University of Dallas</page></plain_text>
