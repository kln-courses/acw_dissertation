<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Power, Protest, and Perichoresis On Being Church in a Troubled World Mary Doak We have entered the twenty-fi  rst c entury with global systems of communication and trade binding the world’s population to- gether more thoroughly than perhaps at any other time in history. Unfor- tunately, this globalization is also presenting unpre ce dented challenges to   human survival and fl ourishing. Our increasingly global economy holds  out the hope that all might participate in the benefi ts of economic develop- ment; yet thus far this economic system is evidently more inclined to in- crease in equality, resulting in a small group of super- rich and massive  populations of deeply impoverished  people. And many of  these poor  today  fi nd that the local resources that at one time provided at least subsistence  levels of food and shelter for their families and communities have now been  appropriated for the global economy. Perhaps even more alarmingly, our  economic system is dependent on practices of production and consump- tion that are unsustainable in their current form, and that are eff ecting a  global change in climate, threatening the conditions of life on this planet.  Together, climate change and a globalized economy are increasing rates of  h uman migration, destabilizing established communities through large-  scale shifts in populations. Given  these urgent prob lems, the task of developing an appropriately  Christian theology of democracy may not seem compelling.  After all,  these  global prob lems exceed the control of the nation state and  will not be solved  by tinkering with forms of national government. Besides, democracy of- ten appears to be broadly accepted as the most legitimate form of govern- ment  today, even to the point that dictators at times feel compelled to hold  78 </page> <page sequence="2">  Power,  P rot e s t ,  a nd  P e r i chore s i s  79 elections that mimic the procedures of democracy. I sn’t providing a theol- ogy of democracy at best a case of theology showing up—y et again—a  l ittle  breathless and a l ittle late to provide a Christian defense of what everyo ne has  already accepted anyway?1 At worst, as some argue, eff orts to provide a  theological defense of po liti cal democracy risk prolonging the failed proj- ect of liberal Christ iani ty, continuing the misguided eff ort to baptize the  ethos of secular society at the cost of a distinctively Christian perspective.2  Rather than further defending what the world (especially the secular world)  has already embraced, some argue that theological energies should be fo- cused on the distinctively Christian perspectives and practices that off er  hope for a real alternative to the suff ering and oppression of this world. Before deciding too quickly that attitudes  toward democracy are irrel- evant to the grave prob lems the  human community  faces  today, it might  be worth noting that current proc esses of globalization involve a system of  power analogous to the imperialism that Christ iani ty has too often em- braced in the past: Th e world is being united in an economic system that  is directed by, and for the benefi t of, a very small group of  human beings.  Further, the ethos of our current form of globalization and the eff ects of  total global climate change are thoroughly undemoc ratic: What aff ects all  is most defi nitely not being decid ed by all! In fact, democ ratic practices of  working together for the common good are seriously undermined by the  magnitude of global systems that far exceed local control, while at the same  time electronic media foster interactions that are defi nitely atomizing (and  often narcissistic). Texti ng, Facebook, and whate ver other electronic net- work is briefl y the rage, take time and attention away from face-t o-f ace en- counters with the real, embodied, and diverse  people with whom we share  the structures and conditions of our lives. To overcome the imperialist  globalization that imposes uniformity and undermines collective agency,  humanity  today needs renewed commitment to diverse, participatory  communities and to practices of inclusive decision- making that value the  distinctness of each person. To the extent that democracy involves  people  coming together to order their common life, we need more, not less,  democracy!3 Empire, it is now clear, has not dis appeared but rather has mutated into  new yet no less virulent forms. Faithful Christian res ist ance thus requires  that we continue to reexamine critically “the shadow of Constantine” and  the often unacknowledged dream of harnessing imperial power to create a  world order that serves the interests of elite Western Christians.4 To be sure,  </page> <page sequence="3"> 80 M ary  Doak democracy is no guarantee of justice, and tyrants can be elected. Yet as  Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith have argued (conclusively,  in my judgment), the best guarantee that policies  will serve the general wel- fare is a structure that ensures that the broadest pos si ble number of  people  are involved in determining who w ill govern.5 Further, and no less signifi - cant from a theological perspective, inclusive communities that foster rec- ognition of  human dignity and a person’s right to contribute to society are  valuable ends-i n-t hemselves. Democ ratic forms of community are not only  the means through which p eople can join together to combat poverty, in- equality, and environmental destruction, then; participatory, democ ratic  communities are also in themselves a countercultural alternative to atomi- zation, uniformity, and the global disregard by the powerf ul of the value  of ordinary  people. Chris tian ity, with its concept of the person fulfi lled in community, has  the resources to contribute to movements in opposition to imperialist  globalization and social atomization. As many have argued, Christian es- chatological hope for ultimate harmony calls us to develop increasingly  demo cratic structures that foster (however imperfectly) participatory com- munities in civil and po liti cal society.6 However, as I  will further argue, this  Christian ideal of reconciled, harmonious communities must be understood  in a way that does not preclude responsible engagement with the realities  of power, confl ict, coercion, and domination. Th e same theological resources  that challenge Christians to seek more inclusive forms of community can too  easily prevent eff ective Christian opposition to injustice, especially if the  hope for ultimate reconciliation is understood as an immediate possibility  that delegitimizes Christian engagement with confl ict. In brief, we need  a theology of democracy that  will enable Christians to resist the ongoing  temptation to be “court chaplain to the pride of nations,”7 without becom- ing so afraid of power that Christians refuse the opportunities— and the  responsibilities—to oppose the destruction of h uman beings, their com- munities, and their environment.8 My discussion h ere proceeds in three steps. First, I begin with a brief  assessment of the growing theological consensus that the mission of the  Church is to witness to, and to work t oward, the goal of divine-h uman  communion. I argue that the Church’s mission as thus understood calls  Christians to oppose the antidemoc ratic forces of imperialist globalization  and societal atomization that divide and oppress rather than unite human- ity. More explicit engagement with this widespread and ecumenical under- </page> <page sequence="4">  Power,  P rot e s t ,  a nd  P e r i chore s i s  81 standing of the Church’s unifying mission would enable pol itic al and  liberationist theologies to defend inclusive, participatory po liti cal structures  with the resources of Trinitarian theology, cont emporary ecclesiology, and  the sacramental practices of the Church. I then turn to the main focus of this essay, which relates power, confl ict,  and even coercion, to the ecclesial goal of ultimate harmony. As Marcella  Maria Althaus-R eid has aptly noted, theologies that emphasize inclusion  risk reinforcing current power structures by neglecting the role of confl ict  and confrontation in the pursuit of liberation.9 While Christians cannot  and should not give up the eschatological hope that exclusion and mar- ginalization  will be overcome in God’s reign, a po liti cal or liberationist  theology that seeks a more humane and liberating society  will need to pay  par tic u lar attention to theologizing the relation of power and confl ict to  this hope for ultimate unity. A clearer articulation of how confl ict can serve  the goal of harmony might overcome the res ist ance to liberation theolo- gies of some of the privileged, though well- meaning, theologians and  church authorities who currently reject as divisive liberationist (and espe- cially feminist) theologies. Fin ally, I w ill conclude with a brief refl ection on the importance of form- ing Christians to deploy power responsibly and gracefully in this world. Communion and Democracy As a Catholic theologian committed to a strongly ecclesial, nonindividu- alistic form of Christ iani ty, my approach to pol itic al theology is based on  the mission of the Church as proclaimed by the Second Vatican Council:  Th e Church is to be the sign and instrument (that is, a sacrament) of u nion  with God and unity among humanity.10 Th is is stated early in Lumen  Gentium and provides the theological basis for that document’s account of  the nature and internal structures of the Church. More impor tant for our  purposes, this sacramental understanding of the Church is also proclaimed  in Gaudium et Spes as the basis for the Church’s mission to the world and  the princip le of Christian activity in all spheres of culture and society.11  We should note that the Church, as described in  these ecclesial documents,  is called to be both sign and instrument: Th e Church is to witness to divine-  human communion in its ecclesial life; at the same time, the Church is to  work extra- ecclesially, to serve as “an instrument” cooperating with God’s  intention of increasing harmony throughout the world. </page> <page sequence="5"> 82 M ary  Doak Th is emphasis on the Church’s mission to foster divine- human com- munion in the world is by no means unique to Catholic Christ iani ty.  Divine- human communion, or theosis, has been and continues to be central  to Orthodox theology, and indeed Orthodox thought has been identifi ed  as the source for the renewed emphasis on communion at the Second  Vatican Council.12 Further, the mission of the Church to be a sign and in- strument of the u nion of all in God has been recently affi  rmed in the  World Council of Churches’ document Th e Church: T owards a Common  Vision,13 and is presupposed (for example) in the otherw ise quite diff er ent  theologies of John Milbank and Miroslav Volf.14 Indeed, the centrality of  the goal of divine- human communion to the mission of the Church has  become the prevailing consensus in cont emporary Christian ecclesiology  in recent de cades. Orienting the mission of the Church as witness to and in serv ice of com- munion helpfully integrates a commitment to this world with a hope that  transcends history: Th e Church is called to further the unity of all in God  that can be experienced in part now but w ill only be given in full beyond  history. Th is is therefore an eschatological perspective as well as a thor- oughly sacramental (indeed, Eucharistic) approach to the mission of the  Church, acknowledging that the telos of harmony within the divine life  gives value and orientation to, but cannot be identifi ed with, historical  projects. God’s grace is at work in this world, but the fi nal perfection of  our life within the Triune God cannot be achieved in this world, as Reinhold  Niebuhr consistently— and rightly— maintained.15 Th e theological signifi cance of divine- human communion has been  further clarifi ed by the explosion of Trinitarian theology in Western Chris- tiani ty in the late twentieth c entury. Th is renewed attention to the doctrine  of the Trinity emphasizes that h umans are made in the image of a God  who is not an identity in stasis, but rather distinct persons in a perichoretic  communion of self-g iving love that is fundamentally other-d irected, bringing  new beings into existence and into the life of the Triune God. Humanity  is thus made for, and only fulfi lled in, inclusive communities of love in  which distinctness is valued and diversity enriches the w hole. As so many  have argued, a Trinitarian perspective reminds us that each  human person  contributes uniquely to the  human (and ultimately divine) community  while, at the same time, fi nding his/her fulfi llment in participating in that  common life.16 </page> <page sequence="6">  Power,  P rot e s t ,  a nd  P e r i chore s i s  83 Chris tian ity thus has obvious implications for eff orts to resist a global- ization that appropriates the benefi ts of the global economy (and wrecks  the planet) for a small percentage of the h uman population, while treating  the majority as disposable.17 Where once hierarchy was defended by invok- ing a monarchical view of the one God over the universe and one absolute  ruler over society, it is now more commonly—a nd appropriately—a rgued  that Chris tian ity calls for  human communities that seek to model the  divine community of nonhierarchical, other-d irected, loving harmony that  is the source and the goal of  human life.18 Instead of legitimizing an im- perialism (including the imperialism of global capitalism) that imposes  uniformity for the benefi t of a powerf ul elite, a consistent Trinitarian  Christ iani ty supports inclusive, diverse communities modeled on the mu- tual self-g iving of the Trinity, communities in which p eople work together  for the common good and are mutually enriched through each other’s  unique contributions. Th is recovery of an emphasis on divine- human communion provides  the basis for a pol itic al theology thoroughly rooted in the central beliefs  and practices of Christ iani ty: Belief in a Triune God, salvation through  Jesus Christ, and the eschatological goal that is proleptically experienced  in the Eucharist all inform the Christian view of the person as oriented to  communities of mutuality.19 Christians are thus equipped to engage issues  of public life— and democracy— with the substance of Chris tian ity, in- formed by essential Christian beliefs about what it means to live as  people  called to communion with God and with all e lse that God has created.  Rather than being para lyzed by, for example, the false dilemma of  either  productive engagement with a secular public life or the formation of com- munities for a distinctly Christian witness, Christians must recognize that  their mission, as Christians, is to image the Trinity in openness to  others  for the greater good of all. Although it is beyond the scope of this essay to explore the  matter in  detail, it is worth noting  here that Western Christians have much to learn  from Orthodox Chris tian ity about how to return the doctrine of theosis,  or divine- human communion, to its proper place as central to the Christian  account of creation, sin, and the redemption of humanity. It might then  become clearer, for example, that Catholic social thought is not in fact an  arbitrary list of rules derived from moral princip les several steps removed  from essential Christian doctrines. Instead, this body of thought strives  </page> <page sequence="7"> 84 M ary  Doak to articulate what it means to live in society as persons oriented t oward  community and harmony with one another and with God.20 When one  considers how seldom Western Christians (including American Catholics)  recognize the centrality of divine-h uman communion to Christian faith,  or off er a faith-i nspired res ist ance to the rampant individualism of US  culture, the importance of current theological work— including theologi- cal dialogue with Orthodox Christ iani ty—on the Trinitarian, ecclesio- logical, and sociopo liti cal implications of communion becomes especially  evident. Th e Ambiguity of Power To further the proje ct of developing a more adequate Christian pol itic al  theology based on divine-h uman communion, I would like to explore h ere  one par tic u lar challenge that should interrupt any too easy focus on har- monious community: the stubborn pers ist ence and even prevalence of   human confl ict in this world. John Milbank is right to insist that Chris- tians understand harmony, not confl ict, to be the ultimate reali ty, but this  does not absolve Christians from acknowledging the role of confl ict in   human relations this side of the eschaton.21 I fear that, without suffi  cient  attention to power dynamics and to the real ity of  human confl ict and co- ercion, a theological emphasis on harmony may undermine Christian eff orts  to achieve more justly structured and diverse communities.  After all, creat- ing a more inclusive and participatory common life is never a  simple, co- operative proc ess in this world (w hether in m atters of statecraft or even on  parish councils!). Rather, eff orts to achieve the common good usually re- quire that we strug gle with and against  those who oppose that good—or  who have a very diff er ent idea of the common good— and such strug gle  involves the deployment of power. As Robin Lovin has recently stated,  “Hope cannot overcome oppression without acquiring some countervailing  power.”22 If a commitment to harmony inclines Christians to avoid con- fl ict and eschew power, are we likely to proff er any signifi cant re sis tance  to the life- destroying oppression all around us? Perhaps the diffi  culty w ill become clearer if we briefl y return to the doc- trine of the Trinity, particularly as the source of the Christian ideal of  harmony. As argued above, the Trinity is the divine perichoretic com- munion of self-g iving love and, as the source and goal of h uman life, the  </page> <page sequence="8">  Power,  P rot e s t ,  a nd  P e r i chore s i s  85 Trinity is the model of mutual love that properly inspires our work for  harmonious and diverse communities. But a Christian praxis intent on  modeling the divine harmony would seem to leave  little room for agonis- tic engagement; a fter all, t here are no power strugg les among the persons  of the Trinity. Must Christians then affi  rm that the use of coercive power, even to pro- tect the vulnerable, is a cooperation with the logic of sin?23 Should hope in  God’s reconciling grace lead Christians to refuse all confl ictual politics, and  respond to vio lence by simply refusing to recognize its existence, by persisting  in a commitment to “act as if . . .  sin is not  there”?24 To be sure, vio lence is not the ultimate power, and a practice of break- ing the cycle of sin with a forgiveness that refuses to retaliate is indispens- able. Nevertheless, we must ask: If Christians refuse in princip le to interrupt  the vio lence and domination in  human life and social structures, whose  interests are served? Does such intentional blindness truly lead to the har- mony Christians claim to seek, or is it more likely to support the false  harmony of an oppressive status quo, which often asks only that we pretend  that this deployment of violent power is not happening? It may be that w omen are particularly attuned to the potential for ten- sion between protesting injustice and seeking reconciliation through self-  sacrifi cial love. Th e ideal of loving harmony is frequently invoked to argue  that w omen should give up “selfi sh” demands for their rights and refrain  from disruptive confl ict and opposition, even when the intent of the  confl ict is to attain a more just world. Feminist pol itic al theories have for this  reason not only emphasized relationality, but also dissensus, confl ict, and  self-a ssertion as essential to the achievement of more just communities.25  Perhaps unsurprisingly, such feminist theories have been criticized by the  Vatican for presuming that confl ictual power dynamics exist between the  sexes and even within intimate  family relation.26 I submit that this ecclesial  critique lends further support to suspicions that the ideal of communion  may be wielded to delegitimize strug gles for justice and thus to support  oppressive power structures. To be sure, the points of coherence between the Christian ideal of divine-  human communion and feminist theories of relationality (especially with  a feminist focus on affi  rming diff erence in relation) give reason to hope in  the ultimate coherence of a thoroughly feminist and communion- centered  po liti cal theology. Yet an adequate feminist po liti cal theology cannot be  </page> <page sequence="9"> 86 M ary  Doak achieved without further theological attention to the appropriate role for  dissensus and confl ict even (especially!) within a Christian praxis of model- ing and working for more harmonious communities. Some developments within communion ecclesiologies in the Catholic  tradition provide further evidence that an emphasis on divine- human com- munion can be invoked in support of unjust power structures. Gerard  Mannion has rightly described as “authoritarian” the communion ecclesi- ology that defends a hierarchical harmony in which the laity is united in  unquestioning obedience to the magisterium, as implied in the “Petrine”  and “Marian” structures advocated by communion ecclesiologies infl u- enced by Hans Urs von Balthasar.27 When the communion of the Church  is understood as comprising a harmonious u nion between the initiatory  leadership invested in the offi  cial (Petrine) hierarchy and the loving recep- tion of this leadership by an obedient Marian laity,  there is  little room for  the laity to engage in valid criticism of the hierarchy (even when the hier- archical abuse of power includes covering up the rape of c hildren). Instead,  and notwithstanding protestations that the Marian princi ple is of greater  value, this model of communion suggests that when the laity question or  challenge their leaders, they have failed to be appropriately receptive and  are damaging the communion of the Church.28 Imagine the implications  if that approach  were to be followed in public life! Th is interpretation of communion becomes even more troubling when the  Petrine-M arian division of roles is applied to the relations within the Trin- ity. Instead of presuming that Trinitarian nonsubordinationism entails a  mutual equality- in- diff erence as the Trinitarian ideal of community,  D avid Schindler, for example, builds on von Balthasar’s work to defend  a thoroughly gendered concept of initiation and reception proposed as a  description of the inner relations of the Trinity as well as a theological  rationale for the diff ere nt roles of the clergy and laity, and of men and  w omen, in church and in society.29 For Schindler, obedient reception of  hierarchical authority is not merely an ecclesiological princi ple but one that  is inscribed within the Trinity and so is both fundamental to h uman rela- tions (especially between men and  women) and the basis for all harmony  in society. As noted above, many communion theologies (rightly, in my  judgment) refute this explic itly authoritarian concept of social harmony;  nevertheless, Schindler’s position reminds us of the importance of attending  to how concepts and images of communion actually function pol itic ally  in the world. Communion no doubt requires leadership and authority, but  </page> <page sequence="10">  Power,  P rot e s t ,  a nd  P e r i chore s i s  87 if  there is no room to challenge abuses of power in the hope of a more perfect   union, we are in deep trou ble! Indeed, it would seem that we have come  full circle h ere, having returned to the previously rejected idea that pol itic al  domination refl ects the dominion of God.30 In brief, a focus on communion with and within the Trinity should  interrupt injustice and contribute to the development of diverse, participa- tory communities. Yet at times the goal of harmonious communion in the  image of, and ultimately within, the divine is invoked instead to encour- age acc ept ance of unjust structures and power in the name of harmony,   whether by explic itly enjoining obedience to authority or simply by failing  to make room for confl ict within a Christian witness to unity. Given this  very real danger of supporting an unjust status quo (from which educated  theologians and church leaders often benefi t), Christian po liti cal theolo- gies cannot prescind from the task of determining the proper role of power  and the place of confl ict in the ser vice of greater communion. In considering this question of the use of power and confl ict in an un- just, fallen world, it is import ant to avoid confl ating power, which is the  capacity to eff ect something, with vio lence (a physical attack on person or  property) or coercion (the attempt to compel). As Reinhold Niebuhr knew  well, power in itself is not evil since power can be positive or negative, de- fensive or off ensive.31 Indeed, power in feminist theories is usually a good  that w omen desire, in opposition to the evils of viol ence and domination  that have denied  women their proper power.32 Th e primary theological dif- fi culty  here is not, then, power per se, but rather the appropriate response  to the real ity of confl ict and the use of coercion in Christian witness to the  goal of harmonious community. I intend to set aside  here the more narrow (and diffi  cult) question of  the use of vio lence by Christians. Not all coercive power involves physical  attacks or threats of such attacks, and I am convinced that that we must  fi rst come to terms with confl ict and coercion in themselves, before deal- ing with the more thorny issue of the Christian use of vio lence. Even non- violent coercive power can make Christians uneasy and, in fact, can be  horrifyingly destructive (especially when it involves psychological coercion).  Nevertheless, coercive power can also be deeply inspiring, as when the  Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. famously refused vio lence and instead de- ployed not only rhetorical power and the power of suff ering witness, but  also the coercive power of boycotts and strikes that remained nonviolent in  the face of terrifi cally violent opposition.33 </page> <page sequence="11"> 88 M ary  Doak One the one hand, we must ask w hether a responsible commitment to  the goal of a just and harmonious community is poss ib le without engag- ing in pol itic al coercion and navigating what is rather redundantly called  “power” politics (since all politics is concerned with power).34 On the other  hand, coercive power to attain the goal of one party against the goals of  o thers, at least on the pol itic al level, seems antithetical to the ideal of rec- onciliation. Th e question still haunts: Are we perhaps denying our true  vocation as Christians when we participate in the confl ict due to sin, rather  than exemplifying the eschatological harmony poss ib le in part now? How- ever much the world follows its own dictates, s houldn’t the Church do  other wise?35 While I cannot fully answer  these complex questions in the space of this  essay, I would like to suggest that a sound basis for integrating the ambi- guity of power into our understanding of divine- human communion can  be found in Paul Tillich’s classic work on love, power, and justice.36 Th  ere  is much still to be gained from Tillich’s insightful account of the relation  between love and justice—a nd of the role of power in each—p articularly  as his perspective is predicated on the goal of divine- human communion.  As Tillich argues, the goal of love is u nion: Love seeks to unite what is in  fact (but should not be) separated, while justice preserves what love intends  to unite. Justice and love are thus integrally related, though not identical:  Without the preserving work of justice, the unity that love seeks cannot  be achieved. Tillich further contends that, in extending forgiveness, love  fulfi lls the demands of justice, while ultimate justice  will be found in the  reunion of all in the reign of God.37 Tillich thus provides a theological basis for explaining that a harmony  without justice is a perversion of—a nd not a witness to!—t he communion  we seek, b ecause without the preservation of what is to be united, t here is  only a false peace that obliterates, rather than reconciles with, the other. A  love without justice, as Tillich further warns, destroys the one who loves  as well as the one who accepts such love.38 Unfortunately, the destruction  of the other is one of humanity’s deepest temptations, since in fi nite exis- tence we continually face the threat that the other  will not make room for  us, and, in turn, we fear making room for that other.  Th ose who bene- fi t from the status quo— including Christians— may thus be especially  tempted by appeals to a false harmony that, without justice, destroys the  other as well as the harmony Christians claim to serve. Insofar as Chris- tian ity calls us to live (in church and in society) in hope for true unity, the  </page> <page sequence="12">  Power,  P rot e s t ,  a nd  P e r i chore s i s  89 Church’s mission requires that Christians seek a justice that permits gen- uine diversity and allows for the harmony in which all fi nd they are more  fully themselves  because of their relationships with all  others. If love thus requires justice, then love must be consistent with the exer- cise of power, insofar as justice requires that we deploy power, even coercive  power, against the destructive power of injustice. In classic Tillichian  language, power is integral to all that is b ecause power is ultimately  the power of being (particularly its ability to overcome nonbeing). It is a   mistake then, as Tillich noted, to identify love with the refusal of power,  on the one hand, and power with the denial of love, on the other hand.39 To  the contrary, he argues, love inherently acts with power to destroy what- ever is against love, which is anything that would deny justice and thus  annihilate what should instead be gathered into unity. Nevertheless, as  Tillich further insists, love extends forgiveness, seeking always to preserve  rather than to destroy the person who is acting against love.40 In Tillich’s ontological analy sis, power—as the power of being—is in- herently good and comes ultimately from God, who is the creative source  of all being and to whom power is properly attributed. Although love,  power, and justice are ambiguous, separated, and at times in confl ict in  this world, they are, as Tillich maintains, united in the divine ground of  being.41 Tillich’s analys is thus reminds us that the divine, reconciling love is pres- ent in the world not only as a force of forgiveness but also as a power that  destroys the injustice that opposes love and impedes the ultimate harmony  of all. Perhaps, then, more theological attention should be given to the cano- nical stories of divine judgment that disturb any simplistic account of  God’s love manifest directly in peace and harmony. Is not the story in  Genesis 3 of the exile from the garden, now guarded with a fl aming sword,  a description of God acting with power to prevent h uman sin from becom- ing everlasting? Certainly the Jewish canon has insisted on remembering  a history in which God repeatedly threatens destruction when injustice  becomes ensconced in the life of the p eople. And, of course, t here is no  denying the role of coercive power in the New Testament imagination  of Jesus’s return as judge to establish the full reign of God:  Th ere is much  coercion and even viol ence in the Book of Revelation. Indeed, even while  we rightly insist that the divine love suff ers—a nd Christian love must also  suff er— with all  under our current conditions of unjust separation, it should  also be remembered that Jesus is described as confronting unjust authority  </page> <page sequence="13"> 90 M ary  Doak and acting with power to restore to the community what society had ab- jected in the name of harmony.42 Had Jesus not been a real threat to the  authorities of his day, it is hard to imagine why they would have bothered  to crucify him. A Trinitarian, communion- centered po liti cal theology might do well to  remain rooted in the canonical stories of God’s power (and of  humans  called to use power) to right injustice, even while this theology focuses on  the ultimate reconciliation of all in God. As John de Gruchy has similarly  argued, a Trinitarian theology of God as a perichoretic communion of love  must be complemented by the prophetic tradition of protest against injus- tice in hopes of a more perfect harmony.43 Resisting any account of divine- human communion that stifl es the de- mands of justice or denies the exercise of power necessary to achieve this  justice w ill, I believe, be further aided by keeping in mind two key points.  First, divine- human communion must be understood as an eschatological  goal that is only partially achievable in this life, so that Christians grapple  honestly with the fact that what is ultimately integrated in the divine re- mains separated and ambiguous in the world. An adequate pol itic al theology  w ill not proceed as though ultimate harmony is irrelevant to this world,  but neither w ill such a theology presume that this harmony is completely  available h ere. Th e second point to keep in mind is that the Trinity is, and  invites us to, a unity-i n-d iversity. Focusing on the fact that the goal is not  a uniformity that obliterates otherness, but rather a unity enriched by di- versity, Christians may yet be inspired to greater consistency in their rejec- tions of false harmony and their oppositions to the injustices that are  diminishing the  human community— and thus all of us— today. A Christian Ascetics for the Use of Power In closing, I would like to mention briefl y the importance of Christian for- mation for a discipleship that seeks harmony with justice.  After all, a Chris- tian witness to reconciliation that accepts responsibility for the use of coercive  power in a fallen world requires growth in wisdom, prudence, and mature  judgment, along with a willingness to risk oneself in love. However much  p eople may yearn for a clear list of “dos” and “d on’ts” to follow, t here is no   simple prescription for an adequate public praxis. But, then, most of us  have learned that love seldom is s imple. We d on’t always know what is the  best  thing to do and, in any case, our motives are often not as selfl ess and  </page> <page sequence="14">  Power,  P rot e s t ,  a nd  P e r i chore s i s  91 loving as we believe them to be. Th e use of coercive power in the serv ice of  love is especially fraught b ecause we are all (including Christians) inclined  to hide our self- serving intentions even from ourselves, and this is true  w hether our interests are served by using or by refusing power. Consider- able spiritual wisdom is needed to negotiate the complexities of one’s own  self- deception as well as the deceptions of the world. Th e recent work of Aristotle Papanikolaou is especially helpful h ere in  pointing to the need for disciplinary practices as formation of the capacity  to love, particularly as Christians strug gle to learn to love the stranger—  and the  enemy— inevitably encountered in public life.44 Indeed, it is rather  surprising how l ittle attention has been given to the need for such lay  formation in the Catholic Church, even though the diffi  culty of resisting the  individualism of our culture and the global economic injustice from which  we in the United States often benefi t is quite apparent.45 Papanikolaou’s  insightful analys is reminds us that truth telling and forgiveness (both high- lighted in sacramental confession) are essential to communion. Indeed, as  he argues, “F ree speech as truthful expression . . . c an lead to relationships  of diff erence that involve res pect, mutuality, and friendship not previously  imaginable.”46 At the same time, without the willingness to risk the con- fl ict that so often results from telling an unpleasant truth, relationships (in  society and in personal life) become distorted. Similarly, the ongoing need  for forgiveness for ourselves, as well as for  others, is essential given  human  failures, limitations, and the reali ty of continued confl ict even in the strugg le  for deeper communion.47 Given this signifi cance of practices of truth telling and forgiveness  for the development of loving relationships, including the development  of deeper and more honest bonds in public life, Christian communities  would do well to expand  these practices beyond the confi nes of sacra- mental confession. Our churches might then better prepare us for the  continual giving and receiving of forgiveness and for publicly speaking  and hearing the truth as we seek an ever- greater harmony with God and  each other. Consideration should also be given to fostering occasions of attentive  engagement with one another in Christian communities and families. If  Christians are to grow in our commitment to inclusive, participatory com- munities, they need to have deep experiences of the unique contribution  of each to the w hole. Th is may be as s imple as returning to such enduring  church practices as potlucks and coff ee hours (with electronic devices  </page> <page sequence="15"> 92 M ary  Doak turned off !) where Christians grow in relationships and learn to appreciate  one another. Th e broader Christian community might also want to consider the  Quakers’ discipline of consensus seeking, rooted in a belief in that of God  in everyo ne. While I w ouldn’t recommend this proc ess as an effi  cient  decision-m aking practice for large groups, it deserves attention as a spiritual  practice that springs from and reinforces a deep commitment to the idea  that each person m atters and has a unique perspective to contribute to the  good of the w hole.48 Such a practice might increase awareness of the ways  this world’s pol itic al proc esses lead to the silencing or dismissal of many  voices. Th is discipline of ecclesial consensus seeking might also strengthen  res ist ance to the domineering pol itic al discourse so inconsistent with  the ideal of an inclusive divine- human communion in which all are  valued in their uniqueness. Conclusion Our highly interactive yet deeply divided— even atomized— world desper- ately needs p eople to come together to resist the increasing ine quality and  environmental abuse threatening the planet  today. Even while democracy  is widely touted, at least as a form of secular government, a very undemo- cratic economic imperialism dominates our planet and imposes conditions  of suff ering and dehumanization on many for the benefi t of a privileged  few. It is generally acknowledged (at least theologically) that  these destruc- tive conditions are contrary to Christian beliefs about the good of  human  beings and indeed of creation, yet the Church as a  whole has not yet off ered  the sustained and power ful witness of re sis tance that Christian faith calls  for. Recovering the centrality of the eschatological goal of divine- human  communion may prove to be an invaluable resource for forming Chris- tians to resist the new forces of imperialism, provided that we have the  wisdom to imagine power in the serv ice of justice and love, and the disci- pline to accept and use such power appropriately.

Surely coercion is inevitable in the raising of  children, since any limits  (or “natu ral” consequences) that parents set involve the use of power to coerce  be hav ior.

My own Catholic tradition has developed extensive formation programs  for clergy and vowed religious, but has largely neglected the formation needs  of the laity who are theoretically most responsible for the public witness of the  church. Th e recent increase in availability and popularity of lay spiritual  direction may prove especially signifi cant in fi lling this gap, particularly if this  direction provides disciplined guidance that avoids an individualistic and  therapeutic approach alone, and instead truly challenges Christians to grow in  po liti cal wisdom and humility. 46. Papanikolaou, Mystical, 194. 47. At times, forgiveness may be especially necessary for a truth telling that  is unduly harsh or, as Papanikolaou observes, demonic, in that it is wielded to  destroy rather than to restore right relationship.
