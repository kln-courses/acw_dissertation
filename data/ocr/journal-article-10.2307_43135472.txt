Éditions Recherche sur les Civilisations, Paris, 2007, 272 pp., ISBN 978-2-86538-314-6 (paperback). EUR 50.00. This volume, publication of which is warmly welcomed, represents the third and final monograph describing the results of research on Ethiopian megaliths that was un- dertaken by Joussaume and numerous collaborators dur- ing the years 1970-1998. Its prime purpose is to report on investigations at Tuto Fela, located some 30 km east of Lake Abaya in the Rift Valley of southern Ethiopia, and thus ca 260 km south of Tiya which is - following Joussaume 's earlier investigations - the best-known of Ethiopia's megalithic sites. Overviews are also included of megalithic sites elsewhere in southern Ethiopia and in the Horn of Africa more generally. Tuto Fela comprises a large tumulus (ca 50 x 30 m) of field stones, placed over a number of graves exca- vated into the subsoil and marked by upright cylindrical stelae. One of these graves had a wooden cover whose remains yielded a single radiocarbon date calibrated be- tween the mid-eleventh and the late thirteenth century AD. Within the tumulus itself were further inhuma- tions, likewise marked by stelae of which some had apparently been re-used from the earlier phase. The burials are described in detail on pp. 78-134. A total of 337 stelae (pp. 33-77) has been recorded, either entire or as fragments. The complete examples range in height from 0.6 to 2.5 m. Many are carved, some with stylised human faces, others with geomet- ric designs which may - in at least some instances - represent body tattoos or scarification. The tops of several stelae have been shaped to resemble the head of a phallus. Of these Tuto Fela stelae, seventeen are now preserved in the garden* of the Museum of World Cultures of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, where they were taken by the Frobenius Expedition of 1935. * Editor s note : the stelae were removed from the garden after the publication of this book, and are currently undergoing con- servation. The older, pre-tumulus, graves each comprised a roughly dug shaft with a chamber to one side, con- taining one or more flexed interments; the stela set in the filled shaft was generally phallic in form. Primary shaping of these stelae appeared to have been done by pecking with a stone implement, although some also bore incisions for which a metal tool was probably employed. The younger burials, within the tumulus, were crammed into hollows between the field stones and likewise marked by stelae, although these tended to be anthropomorphic in decoration with signs that metal tools had been used in their shaping. A detailed osteological account (pp. 80-147) is offered of the skeletal material recovered from the inhu- mations, and the associated artefacts are also described (pp. 148-1 72). In both cases the treatment is more quan- titative than comparative, and the utility of some of the information presented in coloured graphs (e.g., fig. 121) is not readily apparent. Although the osteology of indi- vidual interments is described, and the location of each identified stela carefully plotted (fig . 75), the other ar- tefacts are only briefly discussed by category (pottery, ground stone, glass beads, iron, etc.) without reference to the provenance or associations of individual specimens. No attempt thus appears to have been made to establish a detailed sequence or to determine patterning between the inhumations of the two groups noted above. A flaked stone industry was encountered in the vicinity of - and beneath - the tumulus, where it had apparently been dis- turbed during construction of the earlier graves; it is not wholly clear whether this industry may have continued in use during the period of the burials, nor whether other materials were exploited but only the obsidian subjected to analysis. The pottery, like the form and decoration of the stelae, was completely different from that at Tiya. Chronology receives remarkably little attention. The single radiocarbon date is noted in passing on p. 132 , DOI 1 0.32 1 3/1 6 1 2- 1 65 1 - 1 0 1 20 Published online in March 2009 © Africa Magna Verlag, Frankfurt M.

It is strange that fragments of a massive plank were selected for dating, rather than shorter-lived materials which might have yielded results that could be regarded more confidently as reflecting the feature's true age. The reviewer as- sumes, in the absence of any indication in the text, that the result has been calibrated at a 95 % probability- level. There is no mention that consideration was given to obtaining other radiocarbon determinations: bones from the burials might not have been ideal material for dating but it is not clear whether other sampling was attempted. We are left with the indication (nowhere spelled out in this book) that the pre-tumulus phase of graves at Tuto Feia may date between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. The tumulus itself, and the burials which it contained, are apparently later (p. 16 ), but the reader is given no indication of how much later. Did the two phases run directly from one to the other, or was there a gap between them? If the latter, it is strange that the pottery and other excavated artefacts are discussed as a single assemblage. The book concludes with a useful and comprehen- sively illustrated overview (pp. 1 75-266) of megalithic sites in Ethiopia and adjacent countries, with the unfor- tunate exception of the southern Sudan. It should be noted that, following the archaeologi- cal investigations, both Tiya and Tuto Feia have been preserved in a state suitable for visits by tourists and others. This, particularly at the former site, has involved extensive - perhaps over-enthusiastic - restoration and re-erection of stelae. The authenticity of the result- ant presentation is not fully explained in the publica- tions so far available, and it is greatly to be hoped that full records and justifications for these 'improvements' have been preserved. The book is not always easy to use. The numerous maps, while visually attractive, are presented at vari- ous scales and, since latitudes and longitudes are not marked, their inter-relationships - and thus the general site-locations - are sometimes difficult to determine. Drawings of stelae and other artefacts are admirably clear but, again, scales are not standardised and in some instances not indicated. Most of the photographs are reproduced in colour, and it must be questioned whether this was necessary: with exceptions {e.g., fig. 104), most are informative and the standard of reproduction is adequate, but all too many include no indication of scale. There is no index. The text is presented with admirable clarity but, unfortunately, French is a language which relatively few Ethiopians of post-Imperial generations can read- ily understand. A comprehensive Amharic or English summary, while adding to production costs, would have rendered the book much more accessible to readers in the country to which it primarily relates. The journal Annales ďĚthiopie is now bilingual, and other recent French Ethiopianist publications have included substan- tial English summaries: it was short-sighted of this vol- ume's editor and publishers not to have followed suit.
