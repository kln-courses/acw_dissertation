<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK NOTES ARNOBIUS OF SICCA. The Case against the Pagans (Adversus nationes). Translated and annotated by GEORGE E. MCCRACKEN. 2 vols. ("Ancient Christian Writers," Nos. 7 and 8.) Westminster, Md.: Newman Press, I949. 659 pages. Vol. I, $3.50; Vol. II, $3.25. Translated into English only once before ("Ante- Nicene Christian Library"; reprinted with additions in "Ante-Nicene Fathers," Vol. VI), this excellent production (Nos. 7 and 8 in the "Ancient Christian Writers" series) at times makes even Arnobius live again. His treatise raises almost innumerable and unanswerable questions: "When did he live?" "Who was he?" "What was his connection with Lactanti- us?" "What sort of Christian was the author of the case against the pagans?" The treatise, probably composed in the first dec- ade of the fourth century, defends Christianity against (i) those who accuse it of causing the pres- ent calamities of the world; (2) those who ridicule the Christians' worship of a crucified human being; and (3) those who attack the Christian Scriptures for their nonclassical style. Book ii attacks Greek philosophy and defends Christian antiquity, though Arnobius also holds to the mortality of the soul (!). Books iii-vii attack the anthropomorphism of the ancient beliefs and their symbols: the temples, images, sacrifices, and ceremonials. The chief question raised in my mind in reading Arnobius is: "How many people still believed in the ancient gods and goddesses at the beginning of the fourth century? Is Arnobius raising here a man of straw?" If we are to believe our author, these pagan beliefs were widely held and greatly influential at this time. One ought also to ask, secondarily: "What kind of Christian was Arnobius?" We are indebted to the editors of the "Ancient Christian Writers," Johannes Quasten and Joseph C. Plumpe, and to the translator, George E. McCracken, for this fresh presentation of Arnobius' seven books. An informative Introduction precedes the translation, and the work is well annotated in scholarly fashion throughout.-MERVIN M. DEEMS. BIEDER, WERNER.

Bieder's book is a part of the series of "Abhand- lungen zur Theologie des Alten und Neuen Testa- ments," edited by Eichrodt and Cullmann. It is a very thorough study of the rise and spread of the early Christian belief in Christ's descent into Hades. The author finds that in the New Testament there are references only to a transitorisch descent into Hades; the belief in Christ's purposeful descent arises in the second century because of concern for the dead, the missionary motif, the weakness of faith which finds it must add descensus to cross and resur- rection, and the influence of other religions. He points out that I Peter does not speak of a descent and argues that the "dead" of I Pet. 4:6 are the "spiritually dead." The motivation of Bieder's book seems to be the desire to eliminate the descent into Hades from the creed; he proposes to substitute the more "biblical" appearance to angels found in I Tim. 3: i6. We may question whether such a substitution would possess any value except for those persons who (a) accepted all of Bieder's argument (which is somewhat confus- ing, since at one point he seems to admit that the descensus is actually found in I Peter [p. I98]) and (b) insisted upon a literally biblical phrase for use in the creed. In his actual handling of the question his observa- tions are often acute and always thorough, although his arrangement of the material leaves something to be desired. We may ask whether he lays enough emphasis on the human values to be found in the descensus belief and expressed in other religions of the Hellenistic-Roman world. He rejects speculative theology and the universalism which grows out of it. This rejection necessarily makes his treatment some- what one-sided.-ROBERT M. GRANT. CULLMANN, OSCAR.

The only difference between this second edition of Cullmann's important treatise and the first is the price. The first edition was critically reviewed in this Journal in April, I947 (Vol. XXVII, No. 2). Suffice it to say that the author in answering four questions -(i) Why did the early Christians have need of a rule of faith? (2) What circumstances produced this necessity? (3) What was the form of the first for- mulas and how did they evolve? (4) What was the epitome of Christian faith according to these early formulas?-discovers the bases of the later creeds in significant passages of the New Testament (cf. I Cor. 8:6, 15:3; Eph. 4:4; I Tim. 6:13; Philemon 2:6; I Pet. 3: i8). The core of early belief and confes- sion is that Christ is Lord. Certain influences ac- count for the development of early creeds: baptism and the catechumenate, formal worship, exorcism, persecution, and defense against heresy.

In most cases their insights have been adopted and adapted to new conditions and new knowledge and so remain valid for us today. This judgment of course applies particularly to those reli- gions of the ancient peoples of the Mediterranean world and the Middle East-Egypt, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Palestine, Greece and Crete, Iran-whose influence is still to be seen in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Just as interesting, although not so far- reaching in their effects, are the other religions treated-Old Norse, Tibetan, Indian (North and South America), Eskimo, and Australian aborigine. It would be rash for the reviewer to attempt any criticism of those essays dealing with areas quite be- yond his sphere of comparative competence. But he would like to draw attention particularly to the ex- cellent treatments of Sumerian, Assyro-Babylonian, Hittite, and Canaanite religions by experts in their fields, i.e, Kramer, Oppenheim, Giiterbock, and Gaster. The student of the Bible will find in these four papers up-to-date and scholarly description and interpretation which he can find nowhere else so handily and so simply treated. Together they will define and trace for him the religious, social, and moral currents which flowed through the world in which the Hebrews lived. Without such a knowledge of the cultural background, no true understanding of the Bible is possible. The editor has limited his remarks to a brief preface and a biographical sketch of each of the contributors.-A. D. TUSHINGHAM. HORTON, WALTER MARSHALL. Toward a Reborn Church. New York: Harper &amp; Bros., I949. i22 pages. $I.5o. "When the future historian comes to define the unique contribution of Amsterdam, as compared with that of other great ecumenical gatherings, he may single out the fact that at Amsterdam the re- birth of the Church (and the revitalization of its rela- tion to modern society) was for the first time treated as a primary objective of the Ecumenical Move- ment, co-ordinate with and even above the unity of the Church" (p. 84). This sentence reflects the pri- mary interest of the author in his investigation of the ecumenical movement. One might suppose, with the wealth of writing on ecumenicity complemented by official reports and papers of ecumenical confer- ences, all has been said that could be said on church unity. In spite of the fact that Dr. Horton covers familiar ground and deals primarily with contempo- raneous events, his approach bears a freshness not always discoverable in ecumenical literature. The second lecturer in the newly founded annual William Henry Hoover Lectureship on Christian Unity (established by the Disciples Divinity House at the University of Chicago), Horton describes the three main paths that led to Amsterdam, beginning Students in the field of church history, New Testament, and Christian thought will find this monograph clear in the presentation of its thesis and persuasive in the arguments marshaled for its con- tention.-MERVIN M. DEEMS. EDWARDS, MALDWYN. Family Circle: A Study of the Epworth Household in Relation to John and Charles Wesley. London: Epworth Press, I949. ix+ 192 pages. 12s. 6d. Ten of the nineteen Wesley children survived in- fancy, and they and their father and mother con- stituted a most remarkable family. Maldwyn Ed- wards, the ablest contemporary British historian of Methodism, portrays them all in their best light, and such was the quality of the Wesley family that by so doing he comes close to the truth and rectifies the distortions of less sympathetic accounts. Samuel, the eldest son, was a poet, wit, High Churchman, and Jacobite, who for the sake of prin- ciple "turned his back on any prospects of fame and fortune." Hetty was headstrong, brilliant, and tragic, with a depth of character that was never fully appreciated by her father. Mary was a cripple, beautiful, serene, and loved by all. Martha, gay, generous, intelligent, well read in theology and philosophy, delighted Dr. Johnson with her com- pany. Emily, headmistress of a school, became in later years an able assistant to John at the Foundery. Sukey, Anne, and Kezzy are less well known but shared the intimate life of the closely knit family circle. Edwards rehabilitates the reputation of Samuel, the father, and shows him as a great man, perform- ing his pastoral duties, writing his books, promoting the religious societies, supporting the Society for the Reformation of Manners, condemned by his political views to a country parish, and struggling against an overwhelming burden of debt. "I hear my son, John," he wrote, "has the honour of being styled 'the Father of the Holy Club': if it be so, I must be the grandfather of it; and I need not say that I had rather any of my sons should be so dignified and dis- tinguished than to have the title of His Holiness." The most curious member of the Wesley family was "Old Jeffrey," the family ghost. Edwards con- tends that he was no hallucination but a true pol- tergeist.-WINTHROP S. HUDSON. FERM, VERGILIUS (ed.).

Professor Ferm is to be congratulated upon his imagination and the skill with which he has chosen his contributors for this excellent survey of religions which may be "forgotten" but which continue to wield an influence through our own "living" reli- gions. They are therefore by no means "dead" ex- BOOK NOTES I47</page></plain_text>
