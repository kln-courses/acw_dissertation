<plain_text><page sequence="1">Culture and the Limits of Catholicism: Davi? L Ha?? A Chinese Response To Centesimus Annus Roger T. Ames ABSTRACT. However much the Catholic Church may wish to free the peoples of the world from the excessive atheistic rationalism of the Enlightenment that has pitted science against religion, it is still in most other ways solidly on the side of modernity. Centesimus Annus endorses a form of democracy, a kind of capitalism, a sort of technological development, all of which are strongly undergirded by a resolute belief in human beings as rights-bearing individuals possessed of individual autonomy and a legitimate appetite for private property. The themes of liberal democracy, capitalist free enterprise, and the proliferation of rational technologies form the common focus of both the Enlighten ment and Anti-Enlightenment sensibilities. From a Chinese perspective, these culturally alien themes are viewed with suspicion. The Chinese are increasingly troubled by the corrosive effects upon their culture and social fabric associated with and embedded in the modern izing impulse. But, for a variety of reasons, it certainly seems that China will have little choice but to accommodate modernity in some sense, whatever the risks. The serious question is: "Will China remain Chinese under the condi tions of modernization?" Following Rome's establishment of the China Mis sion in the seventeenth and early eighteenth century, a protracted debate ensued in which Rome seriously reflected on whether it could allow the Chinese to remain culturally "Chinese" and still embrace Chris tianity. More than a century of heated deliberation was brought to closure with the Papal Bulls Ex ilia die (1715) and finally Ex quo singulari (1742), both of which formally and specifically rejected any accom modation of Chinese cultural practices. And this decision stands. Under such circumstances, con structing a plausible Chinese response to Centesimus Annus is at best an academic exercise. It can have little influence on the Church. Papal infallibility apparent in the language of "correct" and "mistaken" views precludes any serious rethinking or revising of this document by the Holy See to accommodate Chinese culture. Certainly there is a small popula tion of Catholics still active in China, and, under different circumstances, this vestige of Chinese Catholicism might enjoy Rome's attention, but the status of this community remains problematic. Not only does it lack official recognition by the Vatican, it has been demonstrably slow in responding to papal advices, as evidenced by the fact that most of the reforms of Vatican II have yet to be implemented in China.1 And what does Centesimus Annus have to offer China? One can expect no sense of engagement with the papal document on the part of the Chinese government or intelligentsia. There are simply too many factors that would inhibit their understanding and appreciation of the tone and substance of the David L.

There is a serious problem in trying to decide if, except in the most Pickwickian of senses, China can even be included in the audience which it addresses. Given China's current attitude toward economic and industrial and technological develop ment, it is questionable whether in any real sense the Chinese would wish either to claim the status of an equal economic partner among the developed nations of the world, or wish to accept the role as a second-class industrial power striving to improve its status by becoming a part of the modern world. China is a land of many walls which together have preserved its "Chinatown-of-the-world" isola tionism. When the Church first engaged the Chinese in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Jesuit Fathers had to traverse a natural wall of mountains, deserts, and oceans, only to be blocked in their mission by a far more formidable wall of alternative cultural presuppositions and values which they and the Western culture they represented were never able to breach. The more familiar man-made wall of mud and stone which can be seen from as far away as the moon has become an enduring symbol of China's physical and cultural isolation, and of its enduring goal of self-sufficiency. In spite of the best efforts of Western internationalism, both charitable and otherwise, China today remains very much a world unto itself. In contemporary language, China has not been part of those post-enlightenment developments which have defined "modernity". In fact, China's cultural stance makes the anti-Enlightenment sensi bilities of Centesimus Annus, as well as Rerum Novarum, appear timid in the extreme. For however much the Catholic Church may wish to free the peoples of the world from the excessive atheistic rationalism of the Enlightenment that has pitted science against religion, it is still in most other ways solidly on the side of modernity. Centesimus Annus endorses a form of democracy, a kind of capitalism, a sort of tech nological development, all of which are strongly undergirded by a resolute belief in human beings as rights-bearing individuals possessed of individual autonomy and a legitimate appetite for private property. The themes of liberal democracy, capitalist free enterprise, and the proliferation of rational technologies form the common focus of both the Enlightenment and Anti-Enlightenment sensibilities. Disagreements about the meanings and values of these phenomena adjudicated by this encyclical are at worst only family quarrels. From a Chinese perspective, these modern themes are viewed in a rather different manner. As a "modernizing nation" in some sense of the term, the Chinese are increasingly troubled by the corrosive effects upon their culture and social fabric associated with and embedded in the modernizing impulse. It is not an exaggeration to say that modernization of the sort assumed both by the heirs of the Western Enlightenment and by the author of Centesimus Annus carries with it such disruptive potential as to be broadly unacceptable to the Chinese. In the past, China has successfully avoided the worst effects of the westernization process by peri odically ejecting from its lands those agents which have successfully breached "the Wall" and taken up residence on their periphery. But no more. For a variety of reasons associated with the globalizing effects of present-day economics and its attendant industrial, transportation and communication tech nologies, it certainly seems that China will have little choice but to accommodate modernity in some sense, whatever the risks. For the inertia of public events is such as to suggest that only by accommo dating the institutions of capitalism, democracy and technology in some form, may China assume a role commensurate with her size and global importance. The serious question is: "Will China remain Chinese under the conditions of modernization?" This then is perhaps the most productive manner of focusing a Chinese "response" to Centesimus Annus. For both the explicit proposals contained in that document and, of equal importance, the values implicated in its arguments, are at once consistent with the ideologies and institutions of a "modern nation", and inconsistent with the continued exist ence of traditional Chinese culture and society. Centesimus Annus allows that "a human being is understood in a more complete way when situated within the sphere of culture through language, history, and the position one takes towards the fundamental events of life, such as birth, love, work and death."(34) Were we to attempt to contextualize the Chinese as so described, we would find that the papal advices would seriously undermine the secur ing features of the Chinese cultural experience. Consider the following tacit and explicit claims of the papal letter:</page><page sequence="3">Culture and the Limits of Catholicism 957 1. A human being is a rights-bearing creature. That is, a person is one "who, as the visible image of the invisible God, is... by his very nature the subject of rights which no one may violate" (64). These rights include the right of private property, the right to form associations in the workplace, the right to a just wage, and the right to discharge one's religious duties. One can state flatly that the Chinese government and, with extremely few exceptions, the Chinese people as well, do not recognize anything like inalienable rights. In the series of thirteen constitu tions promulgated by the various manifestations of China's political center during this century, citizens (read members of the progressive classes) have been deemed to possess only those rights granted by China's various governing bodies. It is assumed that rights, far from being an acultural and ahistorical condition of humanity, are earned through partici pation in and contribution to a specific cultural world. And as the programmed "constitution" of this society continues to be revised and reconfigured, it naturally requires ongoing revision of those docu ments which would seek to represent it. Even such a fundamental right as the right to free speech has not existed in China. And it is arguably the case that the absence of freedom of speech is not the consequence of a totalitarian government over riding the popular weal, but due to an assumption integral to the centuries-long Confucian tradition. The Chinese have never recognized a severe theory/ practice distinction, and have thus always considered not only "saying" but even "thinking" as a kind of "doing". The inhibition of free speech is not a modern invention of repressive Chinese commu nists, but a persistent feature of a Confucian society in which ideas have always been regarded as disposi tions to act that entail real consequences. We in the West deplore censorship and believe free and open enquiry will result in consensus upon what is true about the needs and desires of the majority of human beings, but many forms of censorship are widely accepted by the members of a Confucian society whose government has a paternalistic respon sibility to prevent disrupting influences from damag ing the social fabric. Chinese society cannot be interpreted as a com plex of distinct and autonomous individuals who hold sovereignty over their own interiority, and who corne together in a society ordered by codes of law, where their personal autonomy is seen to be pro tected by natural rights, and the laws that guarantee this autonomy are backed by power and sanctions. One confronts dramatic evidence for the absence of this concept of autonomous individual in the Chinese context when attempting to translate the rhetoric of liberal democracy into the Chinese language. The English sentence, "Liberalism rests on individualism under the supremacy of law," would read to the Chinese something like this: "The doctrine of spontaneous license (ziyu-zhuyi) rests on the doctrine of self-centeredness (geren zhuyi) under the supremacy of administrative regulation (/?z/w)."2 The Confucian assumption traditionally has been that personal, societal, political, and cosmic order are coterminous and mutually entailing, and further, from the human perspective, this order is emergent in the process of one's own self-cultivation and articulation. If we think in terms of concentric circles, there is a synchronicity between one's self realization at the center, and cosmic order at one's extremities. Reflection, I believe, would persuade us that this "focus-field" notion of order is precisely that cap tured in the fundamental Confucian concept of ritually-ordered community, where ritual (//), de fined at the center by the authority of the tradition, not only demands personalization and participation, but further, reflects the quality of its participants. Going back to the History of the Han Dynasty's "Treatise on Ritual and Music," it describes the dynamics of ritual as the center: the medium through which the cultural tradition is inherited, revised and transmitted:3 To realize the real meaning of ritual and music is to be able to create; to understand the culture which inheres in ritual and music is to be able to carry on the tradition. One who creates is called sagacious; one who carries on the tradition is called enlightened. Ritually defined place and role has some force in staking out the privileges and obligations of a person in community, and further, by knitting one into a pattern of relationships, serves to mitigate the extent to which any vested authority can proclaim its decisions and implement its will against one. There is a real sense in which "rites" in China have traditionally served the goals of personal dignity and</page><page sequence="4">958 David L. Hall and Roger T. Ames security pursued by "rights" in our modern Western world. The community constituted by ritual relations is the coming together around a central authority. This notion of centripetal center is made explicit in the language which defines community, both classical and modern. The term for "society", she-hui, taken literally conjures forth the image of "a deferential assembly gathering around the sacred pole erected in the center of mthe community", and has profound connotations of secular religiousness. Nishijima Sadao tells us:4 Such community life, based on the hamlet, had its religious center in the altar (she) where the local deity was enshrined. In the same way there was an altar for the state community (kuo-she), and each county and district also had its own altar. The religious festivals which took place at the hamlet altar (li-she), at which meat was distributed to the participants, helped to strengthen the community spirit. The "family" as the Chinese model of order is an instance of the graduated, centripetal harmony. The contemporary sociologist, Ambrose King, argues persuasively that in the Chinese world, all relation ships are familial:5 Among the five cardinal relations, three belong to the kinship realm. The remaining two, though not family relationships, are conceived in terms of the family. The relationship between the ruler and the ruled is conceived of in terms of father (chun-fu) and son (tzu-min), and the relationship between friend and friend is stated in terms of elder brother (wu-hsiung) and younger brother (wu-ti). The family as the "in-group", is determinate and focused at the center, but becomes increasingly vague as it stretches out both diachronically in the direction of one's lineage, and synchronically as a society full of "uncles" and "aunties". Conveniently, this sense of "focus-field" relatedness is embedded in a cluster of cognate characters: it is articulated in terms of "relationships" (lun), a ritual "wheel" (lun) of social relations that "ripple out" (lun) through patterns of "discourse" (lun) to define the person as a network of roles. For China to abandon its traditional model of ritually constituted person and society and embrace a liberal democratic vision of individual and society is unthinkable ? that is, it would take nothing less than a revolution in Chinese ways of thinking and living to effect it. 2. A second essential claim of Centesimus Annus is that the meaning of persons requires an appeal to transcendent truth. "If there is no transcendent truth in obedience to which a person achieves his full identity, then there is no sure principle for guaran teeing just relations between people." (ibid) The peculiar sort of transcendence required by Centesimus Annus is that evidenced by a Divine Being. "Atheism" (21, 34) is the most pernicious form taken by the denial of transcendence. For atheism, among other consequences, leads one to view human personal and social reality in mechanistic ways. (22) But China remains, even under socialism, a ritually constituted society, without grounding in the objective principles associated with Reason or Natural Law ? nor with the acceptance of anything like a transcendent Deity whose function it is to serve as providential guide and nurturer. This does not mean, however, that the Chinese are areligious. In the Chinese tradition, by and large, gods are dead people. The pervasive Confucian assumption that there is "a continuity between Heaven and humankind" (?en-jen-ho-yi) does not just mean "anthropomorphism" (gods are man shaped), it also means "theopomorphism" (exemplary persons are god-shaped):6 How great was Yao as our ruler! How majestic! Only t'ien is great, and only Yao could model it! Repeatedly, worthiness in the human world defines t'ien:7 Confucius was the sun and moon which no one can climb beyond. Even if someone wanted to cut himself off from the sun and moon, what damage could one do to them? In the canonical text, the Chung-yung, Confucius himself is described explicitly as "Heaven" (t}ien):8 So earnest, he is humanity (jen); So profound, he is an abyss (yuan); So pervasive, he is Heaven (t'ien). As the sinologist, Angus Graham, has observed: In the Chinese cosmos all things are interdependent, without transcendent principles by which to explain them ... A novelty in this position which gready im</page><page sequence="5">Culture and the Limits of Catholicism 959 presses me is that it exposes a preconception of Western interpreters that such concepts as Tian "Heaven" and Dao "Way" must have the transcendence of our own ultimate principles; it is hard for us to grasp that even the Way is interdependent with man.9 The order of contemporary Chinese society is defined by the "sagely" exemplars resident in its historical tradition. The members of the society are themselves possessed of their "humanity" neither as a gift from God nor by virtue of a common genetic inheritance, but as created by ritual enactment. Classically, it is the Sage who serves as exemplar both of tradition in its broadest sense and who expresses "the Will of Heaven", ? that is, the specific environing conditions that set up the viable norma tive and material possibilities in any particular social situation or historical epoch. This is the sense of Mencius' (c380-289 BCE) assertions that "all of the myriad things are complete here in me" and "one who applies exhaustively his heart-and-mind realizes his character, and in thus realizing his character, realizes Heaven (?en)".?0 The "myriad things" ? literally, "ten thousand things" ? is an expression denoting the natural world as a complex of particular elements. It lacks the suggestion of unity, coherence, or transcendence carried by the term "Cosmos". It is simply the welter of "beings" which together constitute the world, without any assumption of underlying "Being". These "ten thousand" things are not ordered by transcendent natural laws; their order is expressed as a shifting pattern of aesthetic harmonies construed from the ever changing perspectives constitutive of the human world. 3. The arguments of Centesimus Annus and Rerum Novarum are directed against both the blind collec tivist tendencies of a socialism which "considers the individual person simply as an element, a molecule within the social organism" (20), and the selfish individualism of a capitalism which fails to recog nize that "there are collective and qualitative needs which cannot be satisfied by market mechanisms". (57) But, though it is true that in Confucianism "man is reduced to a series of social relationships," (21) it would be difficult to claim that Chinese society, even under Marxism, is collective or socialistic in the familiar sense of denying personal realization. The problem is when we speak of the relations of an individual to society, we in the West tend to use the atomistic language of "part" and "whole". In discuss ing China, however, it is more appropriate to speak of the relation of a "focus" to the "field" it focuses. Thus, the togetherness of heaven and humanity suggests the particular human being is focus and "heaven" or "the ten thousand things" is the field focused by that person. The culture is the field, and its exemplary cultural models ? the Sage Kings, Confucius, Lao-tzu, and so forth ? are foci. The political order of any given epoch is field, and the present ruler is the principal focus. Although the family, the society, the state, and the tradition itself as the most extended context, is vague as a grouping, this vagueness is focused and made immediate through its embodiment by the particular father, the communal exemplar, the ruler, the his torical model. This is but to say that the meaning of the group is made present in "supreme personalities": one's own father, one's own teacher, one's own Confucius, and one's own Mao Tse-tung. The Chinese sense of social order assumes that personal and communal realization are coterminous and mutually entailing. Clearly it cannot be under stood in terms either of our Western forms of individualism or collectivism. None of the principal ideas undergirding either of these views in the West has had much influence in China. For example, neither the idealist conception of the human being as possessed of a unique soul which serves to individuate her from other ensouled beings, nor the materialistic, atomistic understanding which iden tifies the person with her body, only extrinsically related to other such bodies, nor, for that matter the existential interpretation which identifies the indi vidual with the creative exercise of her will, have played much of a role in the formation of Chinese cultural resources. And it is equally the case that the Platonic or Hegelian visions which would give rise to a subordination of the individual to the state have held little sway in China. The defect of individualism from the Chinese perspective is its challenge to a ritually ordered society in which the boundaries of the self may be only vaguely delineated. The Chinese "self" is a complex of roles and functions associated with one's obligations to the various groupings to which one belongs. A particular person is this son, this father,</page><page sequence="6">960 David L. Hall and Roger T. Ames this brother, this husband, this citizen, this teacher. Subtract each of these roles from him and nothing constituting a coherent personality remains: no soul, no mind, no ego, not even an "I know not what." The identification of the person with roles is not in any sense a collectivist understanding. It is not a philosophy of self-abnegation in which "selflessness" is taken as a primary virtue. There is a very real sense of personal identity and self-realization, though one distinctly at variance with Western views. The roles defining the person are ritually enacted. Ritual has broad compass in the Chinese social and political order. It involves the performance of any formalized, meaning-invested conduct, role or institution which serves to organize particular human beings in com munity. Thus, ritual spans everything from table manners to court ceremony, from living familial relations to observances for the dead. In China, social order has been construed as a harmony achieved through personal participation in a ritually-constituted community. Thus the ideal of social order could not be realized by following an objective set of laws or customs. In fact, appeal to law, far from being respected as a legitimate resource for adjudicating social conflicts, has been seen as an admission of communal failure. It is an occasion for communal shame. Reservations about the ultimate efficacy of legal resolutions has been so much a part of the Chinese character that the profession of "lawyer", thought to be a potential source of dissen sion among citizens, has been thoroughly discour aged, and magistrates were traditionally left to act as the sole arbiters of legal disputes. It is the emphasis upon social harmony achieved through personalized ritual relationships (//) that most dramatically distin guishes the Chinese ritual community from the Western society of laws. The characteristic of ritually shaped order which distinguishes it from the more legalistic rule-based order is the personal cultivation of a sense of shame, and the self-rectification of the community that ensues from it. Confucius com pared these two alternative models of communal order in the following terms: Lead the people with administrative policies and organize them with penal law, and they will avoid punishments but will be without a sense of shame. Lead them with an example of excellence and organize them with ritual practices, and they will have a sense of shame and, moreover, will order themselves harmoniously.11 This sense of the self-attuning harmony within society itself led Confucius to claim that "the various Chinese states without their rulers are better than the barbarian tribes with them".12 The phenomenon of the individuated self which, from the contemporary perspective, is often taken to be a universal condition, was in fact a rather late development even within our own tradition. In the beginnings of Greek culture, the tribal character of social organization effectively precluded a strong sense of otherness.13 This sense increased markedly with the growth of cosmopolitan cities. In fact, as the word "civilization" itself suggests, in the West "civi lization" was a process of "citification". Attendant upon the rise of cities and of the commercial relations with foreign peoples which sustained these urban centers, the Greeks enforced a strong distinction between the private and the public spheres. This separation of the intimate relations of the family from the more impersonal relations of public life further enhanced the possibility of a sense of self-identity. The family became a training ground for the public life. Things went quite differently in China. Ancient China overcame the threat of the tensions and con flicts attendant upon ethnic and cultural pluralism by the device of employing the language itself, rather than the process of urbanization, as the medium for the transmission of culture. A class of Confucian literati emerged as official counsel to the imperial throne; a canon of classical works was instituted along with a commentarial tradition to promote Confucian doctrine as a national ideology; an exami nation system based upon these texts was introduced and invigilated by the literati in the early Han; from this time on, a centralized and hierarchical bureau cracy perpetuated itself as a social and political infrastructure throughout the two thousand years of imperial rule.14 Further, the Chinese never stressed a distinction between private and public realms. Since the family was the model of all types of relationships, including the "non-familial" relations which obtained among subjects, and between ruler and subjects, there was no effective public sphere. 4. Much of the weight of the arguments of Centesimus Annus derives from a recognition of the consequences of the "the crisis of Marxism" in eastern Europe (37ff). But the consequences of such</page><page sequence="7">Culture and the Limits of Catholicism 961 a crisis in China would be dramatically different from those we are witnessing in the European world. Indeed, the recent events at Tiananmen Square were in large part defined by students and teachers demanding greater respect for intellectuals ? a demand which if met would lead the society away from both Marxist and capitalist forms of egali tarianism in the direction of a revitalized Confu cianism. The relatively slight impact of Marxism in con temporary China reveals the inertia of the Chinese tradition. When the leadership of China decided to import Marxism, counsel was solicited from the Soviet Union which had just gone through its own communist revolution. Russian advisors, appalled by the absence of a proletarian class in China, in effect told the Chinese to call upon them again when they had developed a proletariat! Undaunted by the absence of the "essential conditions" for the success of Marxism, Mao Tse-tung adopted the Marxist ideology as "a Western heresy with which to combat the West". At a theoretical level, he parochialized the universal. For example, his "site specific" variation on dialectical materialism rejected the absolute deter minism of economic principle, and instead asserted an interdependence between economic conditions and the cultural superstructure ? quite the opposite of what had been an idealistic transcendentalism. And at the more practical levels, by selectively promoting those elements of Marxism which con demned the disharmonious effects of competition and private property, he actually increased the weight of basic Confucian values. And, however much the nuclear family was effected by Marxian ideas, the family as a model of the larger society, and the paternalistic character of rule which follows from this model, remained intact. There is little evidence to suggest that contem porary China has abandoned any significant ele ments of its Confucian orthodoxy. The leadership of contemporary China maintains the same characteris tics that have dominated Chinese government since the Han dynasty ? the understanding of the nation as a "family", the filial respect for the ruler as "father", and the consequent sense of rule as a personal exercise.15 With respect to the personal character of rule, it continues to be the case in China that to object to the policies that articulate the existing order is in fact to condemn the ruler's person. Good rulers promul gate good policies. As John Fairbank observes: In Mao's China political deviance had been a treasonous crime far more serious than theft or homicide. It was not possible to separate policy from patriotism and tolerate a loyal opposition. Today the old Confucian tenets seem imbedded in the CCP system: that one rules by virtue of wisdom and rectitude; that theory and practice are a unity, policies a form of conduct manifesting one's character, and attacks on policy therefore attacks on the ruling power.16 We can add to Fairbanks insights the unabated con cern over official corruption as the most pernicious contamination of government, echoing as it does the pervasive Confucian worry over the dissembling "village worthy" as "the thief of virtue".17 The "Crisis of Marxism", if it plays itself out in China in a manner similar to the way it has in Europe, can only lead to an accentuation of those Confucian values which have in fact served to define Chinese society throughout the so-called socialist period. 6. With respect to the more concrete issues raised by Centesimus Annus, one can expect the criticisms of particular social ills to fall upon deaf ears, largely because they are illnesses largely thought by the Chinese to be Western diseases. Consumerism is condemned along with the commodification (29) and a "style of life that is directed towards 'having' rather than 'being' " (53). But China would have to be farther along the capitalist and technological highway before suffering these problems. This is true of personal alienation as well, acknowledged by Cenesimus Annus to be a problem of more indus trialized societies.18 Exploitation and marginalization are problems in China, though it is the political activists far more than the peasants or urban workers who feel themselves exploited and marginalized. The Chinese government takes great pains to make certain the Chinese people feel that, however dire their circumstances, they are suffering together as a family. Whereas iconoclasm is a familiar banner of the Western intellectual, traditionally in China most scholars and thinkers have been co-opted as "estab lishment intellectuals" through the examination system and service in the bureaucracy. When dis affected students and intellectuals do question and criticize the government too overtly, they become</page><page sequence="8">962 David L. Hall and Roger T. Ames vulnerable to government rejection and suppression as disloyal family members. Finally, the clear condemnation of abortion (56, 65, 67) and birth control (47) cannot but fall upon deaf ears in a society which suffers from such a bloated population and all of the problems which are corollary to it. The "one child" policy in China is alive and well, and at least in the urban centers, has an enormous influence on one's future prospects. Again, strictly speaking, in the Confucian tradi tion, a person is not the sort of sanctified being that is the basis of both pro-life and pro-choice concerns. First and foremost a person is a specific doing or making, and only derivatively and retrospectively, something done. What is essentially human is not one's definition as a divinely implanted soul or a legally sanctioned locus of human rights, but the existential project of becoming human. Under such conditions, our moral questions surrounding abor tion and birth control are simply irrelevant. Clearly Centesimus Annus is Eurocentric ? not only in the obvious sense of ignoring the more exotic areas of the world, but in the less obvious, but far more pernicious sense of masking ethnocentrism under the guise of universalism. Universalism is, after all, the form ethnocentrism takes in the West. The Church is forced by such universalist sensi bilities to believe that being human, and having a "correct conception of the human person" (65) means to be and to think pretty much as Anglo European Roman Catholics do. Such a universalism and the acceptance of objec tive ideas and values merely masks its ethnocentrism by the claim that its self-understanding has universal applicability. Thus, one paradoxical element of such ethnocentricity is the rejection of ethnocentrism. But provincialism cannot be avoided by simply making naive claims to objectivity and universality; it can only be held at bay by a recognition of the inescapa bility of one's own parochialism, and an openness to entertain the vital differences of alternative cultures. Seeking to compare Chinese and Western values ? whether we select the Western Enlightenment or anti-Enlightenment sensibilities as our basis ? in volves the comparison of two sets of ethnocentric beliefs. Most of us who occupy a privileged place in a Western democracy, whether or not we are reli giously inclined, consider ourselves autonomous individuals, possessing natural rights, with a faith in our ability to search out the truth of things, and with some confidence that reason and good will can solve many, if not all of our problems. We are respectful of governmental authority when it serves to nurture freedom and autonomy for its citizens, but are perfectly capable of becoming adversaries of the government if and when it threatens those same values. We identify ourselves with ideas, values and principles which we believe reasonable, and employ our religious, scientific, and political institutions as instruments for the implementation of those ideas and values. Among our intellectual elites there is doubtless a great deal less naive assent to the beliefs listed above, but the trust in objectivity lingers. The visions of natural and social scientists, our theologians and philosophers alike, still reflect the belief that there is an objective order to things.19 This faith extends for many of us into the idea that human beings have objective natures, identifiable characteristics that make us essentially the same even when moving from one society or culture to another. Western ethnocentricity has traditionally ex pressed itself in a universalist perspective ? the search for and assertions about transcendent truths undergirding human nature and society. Chinese ethnocentrism, on the other hand, has been based upon the centrality and perceived worth of the Chinese culture, where racial and linguistic and geographical factors reinforce what is first and fore most a cultural identity. Even the so-called Marxist China remains a cultural identity grounded in the model of the extended family and filial dependency. Western-style individualism is as perverse a possi bility for contemporary Chinese socialism as it would have been for historical variations on Men cius' benevolent government (jen cheng). It is as much the case in the modern era as it was in the pre Republican period that a "healthy suspicion" of governmental power is tantamount to indicting the personal character of the ruler. Moreover, technol ogy, the sometimes idol of the Western world, is a serious threat to China ? not principally as a potential cause of commodification, consumerism and alienation, but due to the dramatic effect it would have on China's ritually oriented society. For by rationalizing social and economic interactions, technology has the potential to subvert the ritual</page><page sequence="9">Culture and the Limits of Catholicism 963 grounding of interpersonal relationships. Finally, asking the Chinese to recognize that they have inalienable rights is to ask them to transmogrify into beings with essences or natures, a psychological revolution of enormous magnitude. Wishing for increased autonomy and individual freedoms for the Chinese people, along with access to the technol ogies and economic institutions which make for the Western standard of living, is to condemn the Chinese order to dissolution. Notes 1 The Rites Controversy which raged for nearly a century in which Rome had to decide whether the Chinese Chris tians could remain culturally Chinese, and the massive anti Christian propaganda campaigns and pogroms that emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, were the natural expression of this collision between whole civilizations. The ultimate failure of the accommodationist position in the Rites Controversy is fair demonstration that Rome was not ready to tolerate alternative world views.

Although it was abolished in 1905, a persuasive argument can be made that the Communist regime which came to power in 1949 has, after the obligatory interregnum, re-established the familiar imperial structure, complete with national ideology, hierar chical bureaucracy, and a sociopolitical system that provides a place for all of China's people. 15 See Fairbank, John: 1987, China Watch (Harvard Univer sity Press, Cambridge, MA), pp. 83?94. 16 China Watch p. 209. 17 Analects 17/11. 18 At the Fifth East-West Philosophers' Conference con vened in Honolulu in the summer of 1969, the ostensive theme of the conference was "alienation", and some con siderable time was consumed trying to determine whether there is any such term in the Chinese language. 19 As we mentioned in an earlier note, however, there are rapid changes in these beliefs ? especially at the level of philosophic thinking. These changes could eventually lead us to have somewhat greater sympathy with the Chinese sensibility. But we are still far from abandoning our sense of rational order. This is particularly so with respect to the belief in universal rights and a common human nature ? the very ideas the Chinese aesthetic understanding of order most directly challenge. David L.
