<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRETAN RELIGION IN RELATION TO GREEK RELIGION B. AL One of the most interesting problems of science is the question how the origin of Greek civilisation should be explained. It is gen- erally agreed that it sprang from a blending of the civilisation of the "Indo-European" tribes which since c. 2000 B.C. had been entering Greece from the North, and the civilisation which before the coming of these tribes had its centre in Crete. Although there is agreement about the actual fact of the blending, it seems more difficult to arrive at anything like agreement about the measure in which either culture contributed to this blend. Yet it is this problem that persists in drawing us, because if ever an explanation is to be found for the miracle of Greek culture it will be by our solving this problem. The most important element of a civilisation is its religion. No less than the other elements of Greek civilisation, Greek religion is the result of a blending: a blending of the "Cretan" religion with the religion of the "Indo-European" immigrants. In the following pages we intend giving a general outline of our knowledge of Cretan religion, and after that we shall try to ascertain in what way this religion contributed to the birth of the Greek religion. The Cretans are often asserted to have wOrshipped a monotheistic mother-goddess1). But the arguments alleged for this assertion are none of them conclusive2). With certain reservations, it is true, Cretan culture, as a whole, may be called matriarchal, but this does not necessarily imply that Cretan religion knew the worship of 1 ) Especially Sir Arthur Evans, The Palace of Minos, passim; Ch.

There is nowhere any evidence of monotheism, and evidence of motherhood only in the case of one of the goddesses, the goddess of the tree-cult. Moreover, this motherhood is a quality only later acquired by the goddess. On the other hand M. P. Nilsson !) goes too far, when he feels justified in distinguishing four goddesses and two gods: a goddess of the house-cult, a p?t??a ?????, a goddess of the tree-cult, a goddess of the sea, a p?t???? ?????, and a war-god2). Of the goddess of the sea there is but one, supposed, representation, viz. on the gold ring from Mochlos5); but the goddess represented on it is a goddess of the tree-cult4). A goddess of the house-cult the Cretans probably never knew, as I presently hope to demonstrate. Of the war-god there is again but one supposed representation, viz. on the sarcophagus of Milato; but the god represented is identical with the p?'t???? ?????5). On the other hand I believe that a sepa- rate and distinct goddess of the pillar-cult was indeed worshipped by the Cretans. Summing up we may consequently say: the Cretan pantheon, so far as it is known, comprises three goddesses and one god. For our knowledge of the Cretan or Minoan 6) religion we have at our disposal three kinds of archaeological data: 1. cult-places and cult-objects, 2. plastic representations of deities, 3. representa- tions of religious acts, chiefly on seal-rings, seals and seal-im- pressions. The cult-places which have been excavated, are exclusively 1 ) M. P.

The latter goddess probably came straight from the East, the origin of the former is still a matter of conjecture. When they came to Greece the immigrants perhaps worshipped a war-deity of the male sex, which sex was modified under the influence of the Cretan religion with its predominantly female pantheon. 3) Reproduced int. al. in M.

The Mycenaean religion is th-e first stage in the blending of Cretan and immigrant religion and consequently contains several Minoan elements, but also several foreign to Minoan religion.

Archaeologists have someti- mes thought to find house sanctuaries, but they are in all probabil- ity no sanctuaries, but repositories for sacred objects1). For these apartments are small-sized and their contents form a motley collec- tion of cult-objects arranged in the most arbitrary manner. Besides not a single representation is known of a sacred act performed inside the house. All ceremonies take place in the open. As for the caves and mountain-tops, we do not know what deity was worship- ped there. I quote Nilsson: "An allen diesen Pl?tzen finden sich die ?berreste eines lebhaft gepflegten Kultes; ihre Art ist aber r?tsel- haft, und noch weniger k?nnen wir ahnen, ob G?tter hier verehrt wurden, oder welcher Art diese G?tter waren. Weder die sonstige ?berlieferung aus der minoischen Zeit, noch die griechischen G?tter, die sp?ter an einigen dieser Stellen verehrt wurden (Her- mes Kranaios, Eileithyia) bieten einen sicheren Hinweis"2). Be- side sacred caves and mountain-tops there must also have been tree sanctuaries. Actually they are only seen represented on seals. Among the cult-objects that have been found, special mention should be made of the "horns of consecration" and the double axe. The manner in which these objects are represented proves that to the Cretans they were the most sacred symbols of their religion. Their further significance, however, is unknown to us and for the time being every attempt to deduce anything from these objects about the Cretan religion is doomed to failure. Thus e.g. the suppo- sition that the double axe indicates the Cretans' worship of a sky- god and mother earth3) is definitely wrong4). Further sacred requisites are the libation jug, the rhyton and the ??????, three sacred vessels, which can give us no further information about the essence of Cretan religion, anymore than the "horns of consecra- tion" and the double axe. The second group of archaeological data, the plastic repre- sentations of deities, do not carry us much further. The most an- 1) Cf. B. Schweitzer, in Gnomon 4 (1928), p. 179. 2) M. P.

They probably belong to the oldest and original populati?m of Crete, which after the Neolithic Age was absorbed by that coming from Anatolia1). For we see the neolithic sculptures gradually degenerate and finally disappear completely2). The interpreta- tion of these sculptures corresponds with that of the so-called "Veneres" of the Late Palaeolithic times from which the Cretan statuettes may directly or indirectly derive. Now I need only remind the reader of the many and varied explanations for the ?Veneres", to make it clear that the Cretan neolithic "idols" may be interpreted in widely different ways. In my opinion they should be looked upon as talismans for the furtherance of fertility in man and beast, so of animal fertility3). But this interpretation is by no means a universally accepted one4). The same holds good for the Middle- and Late-Minoan idols in Crete. To mention but one instance, the so-called snake-idols have in turn been taken as goddesses, priest- esses, snake-charmers and dancers. The interpretation of the plastic representations of the deities, therefore, is very uncertain, so uncer- tain in fact that B. Schweitzer5) even doubts, if the Cretans ever depicted their deities by means of the plastic arts. Although I am with Nilsson 6) in the belief that Schweitzer exaggerates on this point and that at any rate the bell-shaped idols should be accepted as genuine representations of gods, I cannot on the other hand agree with Nilsson when he says that the bell-shaped idols are represen- tations of a particular deity, viz. the goddess of the house-cult. A seal-impression from Zakro7) proves that the bell-shaped idol occurring on it does indeed represent a goddess, but also that she 1) Cf. H. Frankfort, Studies in early pottery of the near East II, p. 100, note 1. 2) Cf. B. S. A. Al, op. cit. pp. 87 f. 3) This explanation fits in with the explanation of the ?Veneres", now widely accepted.

Nilsson, op. cit. pi. 13. 3.</page><page sequence="5">212 CRETAN RELIGION IN RELATION TO GREEK RELIGION is a goddess of the tree-cult. Besides, the existence of a house-cult in Crete may be doubted, as the house sanctuaries, supposed to have been found, are not house sanctuaries, as I have pointed out before. So we find that the bell-shaped idols are no representations of any particular goddess, but that they do represent goddesses. This, however, does not imply their being cult-statues. With Schweitzer I am inclined to believe that the Cretans had neither cult-statues nor temples. To all intents and purposes our knowledge remaines restricted to these general conclusions. For it is uncertain why some bell-shaped idols should carry snakes and other idols should have birds on their heads. And the meaning of the curious attitude of the arms of some idols can only be guessed at. With the third group of archaeological data we are on firmer ground. It is true that they are difficult to interpret, but always easier than the other archaeological data, referring to religion, be- cause they, at least, give us a representation of an act. They tell us that the Cretans thought of the gods, generally, as dwelling in Heaven, for in several scenes we see them descend from the sky, mostly in human shape, sometimes in the shape of a bird. On their arrival on earth they are greeted by the faithful with arms raised, the women always standing, the men sometimes kneeling. Besides these epiphanies from the sky we also know epiphanies of the goddess coming from the sea. Further, the seals prove the existence of a tree- cult, a stone- and pillar-cult and of the worship of the goddess of animals. More in particular the seals of the goddess of animals, to begin with, tell us that she is now represented with an accompanying lion, now with an animal which she holds, while it stands on its hind legs before her. In scenes of later seals she stands in the heraldic scheme, either between lions, or between griffins, swans, or other birds. This goddess is generally called p?t??a ????? with a name derived from the Greek religion. Her cult was propagated far and wide in the Aegean World, for her image has been found in many places. Not everywhere, however, she will have borne the same name. We are therefore not allowed to say that we know her name, although we know at any rate one of them: Britomartis or Britamar-</page><page sequence="6">CRETAN RELIGION IN RELATION TO GREEK RELIGION 213 tis or Britomarpis. She is a virgin hunting-goddess and was later identified with Artemis. About this Britomartis the Greek myth relates that at a given moment her name was changed and that from then on she was called Dictynna. Now Dictynna means: goddess of mount Dicte. It may be deduced from this myth that Britomartis was primarily a hunting-goddess, but was also worshipped on the mountains, in other words had also become a mountain-goddess. We can also conclude this evolution from hunting-goddess to mountain-goddess from the data of Minoan glyptics. On a seal-impression from Late- Minoan IIl) the p?t??a ????? is represented on a mountain between two lions. All this disproves the opinion that the Minoan p?t??a ????? is identical with the Magna Mater of Asia Minor. For it cannot be proved that the Magna Mater developed from p?t??a ????? into mountain-goddess, whereas in the case of the Minoan goddess we see this evolution actually taking place. Besides, the Magna Mater is almost exclusively accompanied by lions, the Minoan goddess also by other animals. The accompanying animals in the case of the Minoan goddess often have their place in the heraldic scheme, a scheme that has not been found in the case of the Magna Mater, the motif of a deity standing on an animal, again, being quite un- known to Minoan art. On the above-mentioned seal-impression the Minoan goddess is holding a spear in her hand, an attribute never taken by the Magna Mater. In addition to this the Magna Mater besides being a p?t??a ????? is also a mother-goddess, which the Minoan p?t??a ????? is not. Along with the aspect of mountain- goddess the Magna Mater also possesses that of vegetation-goddess, the latter aspect being utterly foreign to the Minoan p?t??a ?????. Finally the male votary on the seal-impression in question is not to be compared to the "Galloi" of the Magna Mater, who for the sake of the goddess deprive themselves of their virility. The diffe- rences between the Magna Mater and the Minoan goddess, conse- quently, are striking and numerous. Yet a certain resemblance between the two goddesses cannot be denied; both are of the same type. But the Magna Mater represents 1) Reproduced int. al. in M. P. Nilsson, op. cit. pi. 18. 1.</page><page sequence="7">214 CRETAN RELIGION IN RELATION TO GREEK RELIGION a much further evolved stage of this type, possessing in addition the aspect of a goddess of another type, viz. a vegetation-goddess. So when H. Frankfort1) finds that the East-Cretan "Vassiliki- ware" is related to Anatolian pottery, and even ventures the opinion that Anatolians migrated from South-West Asia Minor to Crete, when, further, he traces later Cretan pottery back to the "Vassiliki- ware", it is obvious to assume that the Cretan p?t??a ????? also had her origin in Asia Minor, but developed on independent lines in Crete. In this way it may be explained how the Cretan p?t??a ????? partly resembles the Magna Mater, partly differs considerably from her. Although therefore the Cretan goddess and the Magna Mater had the same origin, the former never got as far as her Anatolian sister. This is of course in the first place due to the different character of the Cretan mind, which was less systematizing, in the second place, however, to the coming of the Northerners to the Aegean World. On entering Greece these "Indo-European" immigrants appear to have at once arrested the development of the Cretan p?t??a ????? her case, as we shall see, being quite different from that of the goddess of the tree-cult. Midway in her development from hunting- goddess to mountain-goddess the "Indo-European" tribes either identified her with one of their goddesses or admitted her as a new goddess into their pantheon. This wholly or partly new goddess is the Greek Artemis, as is proved by the fact that the oldest Greek representation of Artemis, the so-called winged or Persian Artemis of Archaic art, links up directly with the Minoan type of the p?t??a ????? 2). The speedy acceptance of the Minoan goddess in Greek relig- ion is undoubtedly owing to the fact that the character of this goddess did not appear too strange to the "Indo-European" immi- grants. The case of the goddess of the stone- and pillar-cult is different; the immigrating population rejected this goddess, for not a trace of her is to be found in Greek religion. But even in Minoan times, towards the close of the Minoan period, this goddess seems to have had no pronounced cult any longer. Already in 1 ) H. Frankfort, op. cit. pp. 85 ff. 2) See M. P. Nilsson, op. cit. pp. 286 f.</page><page sequence="8">CRETAN RELIGION IN RELATION TO GREEK RELIGION 215 Minoan times the stone- and pillar-cult showed a tendency to merge into the tree-cult; in various scenes the cult of stones and pillars is attended with tree-cult1). This phenomenon does not stand alone, for the stone also figures in the cult of the Magna Mater as vegetation-goddess, although we cannot specify in what way and to what extent. So in spite of the fact that in all probability the pillar-cult was no longer of great importance by the end of the Minoan period, we must yet distinguish a goddess of the pillar- cult. We see her represented on a gold ring from the necropolis of Phaestus2) and on a gold ring of unknown origin3). As this goddess, however, is of no importance to the development of later Greek religion, we need not consider her further. Whole-heartedly accepting the p?t??a ?????, and on the other hand definitely rejecting the goddess of the pillar-cult, the immi- grant population of Greece had to come to an express understanding with the Cretans about the two deities of the tree-cult. Since Sir Arthur Evans' well-known article "The Mycenaean Tree and Pillar Cult" 4) we know that the tree-cult represented one of the most important aspects of Minoan religion. In this cult two deities were worshipped, a male and a female deity. The female deity is repre- sented as a goddess who appears coming through the air, or from the sea, which epiphanies were brought about by dancing and by touching the sacred tree. On her appearance she was honoured with flower offerings and libations. While these facts may be gleaned directly from Minoan glyptics, it is possible to extend our knowledge of the goddess of the tree- cult by studying the myth of the Greek Ariadne. For Ariadne ac- cording to the Greek tradition was of ancient Cretan descent and the character of her cult along with several elements in her myth point to the fact that she was originally a goddess of the tree- cult5). From Ariadne's myth, then, we may deduce that the Cre- 1) B. S. ?. Al, op. cit. pp. 25 f. 2) Reproduced int al. in M. P.

A. Al, op. cit. pp. 98 ff.</page><page sequence="9">216 CRETAN RELIGION IN RELATION TO GREEK RELIGION tans pictured their goddess of the tree-cult as a virgin goddess and as the giver of the annually flourishing and passing tree-vegetation. There is as well reason to draw a parallel between her and the Magna Mater as there is between the p?t??a ????? and the Magna Mater. As said before the Magna Mater, beside having the aspect of mountain-goddess and goddess of animals, is also goddess of vegetation. We may therefore compare her in this respect with the Cretan goddess of the tree-cult, which leads us to find that also in this aspect the Magna Mater evolved much further than the Cretan goddess; the Magna Mater being the goddess of non-agrarian vege- tation in general1), the Cretan goddess only of tree-vegetation, perhaps even of the vegetation of one particular tree. Again the facts do not point to the identity of the two goddesses, although they do suggest relationship. How easily a goddess, belonging to one particular tree, may become a goddess of a group of trees and of a wooded district, and after that a goddess of non-agrarian vege- tation in general 2). We may therefore say that the Cretan goddess of the tree-cult is related in origin to the Magna Mater in her aspect of vegetation-goddess, but that she has less far evolved than the latter, let alone has become one with the p?t??a ?????, as is the case with the Magna Mater. While considering the annual tree-vegetation as a gift from a goddess, the Cretans formed themselves a concrete image of the vegetation itself in the shape of a divine child or a young god. The conception of the vegetation-god as a youth finds expression on various seals, the god being represented as descending from the sky or alternatively as a p?t???? ?????, often in the heraldic scheme. The conception of the vegetation-god as a babe is embod- ied in a seal impression from Cnossus 3) and in the myths of the eponymous heroes of numerous Cretan towns4). Besides, in Crete we also find the conception of a vegetation-god as a child and youth in such Eastern figures as Tammuz, Adonis 1) The goddess of agrarian vegetation is quite another goddess. 2) Cf. J. Przyluski, in Le Mas?on 49 (1936), p. 297. 3) Reproduced int. al. in M. P. Nilsson, Geschichte der griechischen Reli- gion, pi. 26. 6. 4) Cf. M. P. Nilsson, op. cit. pp. 294 ff.</page><page sequence="10">CRETAN RELIGION IN RELATION TO GREEK RELIGION 217 and Attis. From these figures we learn as might be expected, that the birth or appearance of the vegetation-god was thought of as an annually recurring event. Annual birth or appearance, however, implies annual death or disappearance and we find this idea ac- cordingly expressed in the myths of Tammuz, Adonis and Attis. Now the chief accent may be laid on the annual birth, but also on the annual death. The former is the case with the Attis of Asia Minor, the latter with the Syrian Adonis. In Crete we see the birth and the appearance of the vegetation-god represented more than once, his death only on the sarcophagus of Haghia Triada1). And even on this sarcophagus the epiphany of the vegetation-god is re- presented along with his death 2), so that even here the impression remains that with the Minoan god more stress is laid on his birth or appearance than on his death. This being so, we should not so much compare the Minoan god with Adonis as with Attis; so here again a comparison between a Cretan and an Anatolian deity. And we again find that both gods are of the same type; they are both gods of the reviving vegetation. Also in this case, however, the Anatolian deity has evolved further than the Cretan, for Attis is a deity of non-agrarian vegetation in general, the Cretan only of tree- vegetation. Besides, Attis has quite another aspect, because he is the mythical representative of all those who unite with the Magna Mater by the sacrifice of their virility. We may consequently state that apparently the two gods have a common origin, but have deve- loped independently. It is probably also owing to this common origin that the develop- ment of the two gods to a certain extent ran parallel. Just as the Anatolian god of vegetation and the Magna Mater in her aspect of vegetation-goddess developed a relation of son and mother, so in Crete relation of mother and child arose between the female and the male deity of the tree-cult. This is shown by the Amathusian myth of Ariadne, who dies in childbed, and by the texts Plut. Marc. 20 and Diod. IV 79 ff. The Amathusian myth reveals the vegetation- goddess Ariadne to us as the mother of a vegetation-god3), the 1) Thus, rightly, ?. Schweitzer, op. cit. pp. 191 ff. 2) B. S. A. Al, op. cit. p. 70. 3) J. Meerdink, Ariadne, Thesis, Amsterdam 1939, pp. 110 ff.</page><page sequence="11">218 CRETAN RELIGION IN RELATION TO GREEK RELIGION texts speak of the epiphany of ??t??e?, by which goddesses of the tree-cult are meant1). Both these data are instructive: from the first we learn that it is the birth of the vegetation-god to which prominence is given. So we must not compare the Cretan tree-cult to the Syrian cult of Adonis and Aphrodite, in which the stress is laid on the death of the vegetation-god2), but to the Anatolian Attis-Magna Mater cult. This again confirms our opinion that the Cretan and Anatolian religion are of the same stock. From the other of the two data we learn that Cretan religion is still far from the syncretism of Anatolian religion, in which the Magna Mater and Attis bulk so large that we may speak of monotheism or with D. G. Hogarth3) of "Dualmonotheism". This confirms, therefore, our other opinion, supplementing the first, that the religion of Crete is in a more primitive stage than the kindred Anatolian religion. We may once more attribute the fact, that Cretan religion did not develop any further in this respect, partly to the difference in character between Cretans and Anatolians, partly to the arrival of the "Indo-Europeans". It is true that the "Indo-Europeans" did not at once interfere with the gods of the tree-cult, for the evolution of these deities succeeded in reaching a more advanced stage than the evolution of the p?t??a ?????, who was immediately admit- ted to the Greek pantheon, and a more advanced stage than the evolution of the goddess of the pillar-cult, who was apparently at once rejected. But at last it became necessary for them to define their attitude towards the tree-cult too. The tree-cult was the central cult of Minoan religion. So it could hardly be rejected. On the other hand the gods of the tree-cult could not be eagerly welcomed either, for the idea of an annually dying and reviving deity was quite un- familiar to the immigrants. Fortunately it was not the vegetation- god's death on which the Cretans laid the greatest stress, for this was a notion to which even the later Greeks could never get used. Because of this notion they called the Cretans liars4). The immi- grants, however, could accept the birth, even if not the annual birth, 1 ) B. S. ?. ??., op. cit. pp. 104 ff. 2) B. S. ?.

The supreme god of the immigrants was father Zeus, the only male deity of the Cretans the vegetation-god, represented as a babe and as a youth. The compromise was effected in this way, that from then on the father-god Zeus was said to have been born in Crete, and further, that here and there Zeus was worshipped as a youth. "Zeus Cretagenes" is the formula in which the first part of the compro- mise is contained. The second part finds its formula in: "the beard- less Zeus". The birth of Zeus in Crete became part of the Greek mythology of Zeus, as a beardless youth Zeus received a statue on Mount Dicte i) and was represented on coins from Phaestus dating from c. 360-300 B.C. 2). In the latter place, as well as in some other Cretan places3), the very name became a matter of compromise; the god who appears in a tree in the shape of a bird 4) being called Zeus Velchanos, of which the first part is the name of the "Indo-European" supreme god, the second part one of the names of the Cretan god of the tree-cult. Although agreement had thus been reached about the birth, or the appearance of the vegetation-god, the annual repetition of the birth was a too foreign notion to the immigrants and we conse- quently find this notion only preserved in a practically unknown reference by Antoninus Liberalis5). There is better-known but again uncorroborated evidence of the annual appearance as a youth, viz. the famous hymn, which was found in the temple of the Dictaean Zeus near Palaikastro and which undoubtedly refers to the god whose image stood on Mount Diete. In this hymn Zeus is called upon to come to Mount Dicte every year at the head of his daemons and pour out his blessings over wine, flocks, produce of the fields, bees, towns, ships, the young citizens and the law. The "Indo-Europeans" could not accept the idea of death, let alone of the annual death of Zeus. The Cretans apparently did not insist on this idea being expressed in the official mythology of Zeus. 1 ) Etym. Magn. s.v. ???t? ? e?ta??a d? ???? ??a??a ????e??? tarato. 2) ?. ?.

However, they soon gave up the idea of an annual recurrence of this death. We no longer find any direct evidence of it. We may gather however from their belief in the annual birth of the vegetation-god and by comparison with similar gods of the East that the Cretans had believed in it. After the "Indo-European" tribes and the "Cretans" had thus come to terms about the male deity of the tree-cult, a solution had to be found for the problem of the female deity. She was as much respected by the Cretans as the male deity, or rather, they formed an inseparable pair as mother and son. As pointed out before, we must not imagine, however, that the tree-cult knew only one divine pair in the Aegean World. By the side of Ariadne we know, with certainty, a Helen, by the side of Velchanos a Hyacinthus. And it is probable that the two names ?? and ?????? found in Cyprus, names which cannot be derived either from Indo-European or Semi- tic1), are also names of "Cretan" gods of the tree-cult. These gods were merged in that Adonis who was later introduced into Cyprus. Similarly other Cretan gods of the tree-cult merged into other Greek or Semitic gods: as e.g. Hyacinthus into Apollo and, as we saw, Velchanos into Zeus. But Zeus, of course, did not only absorb Velchanos. Other gods too were absorbed by him and, unlike Velchanos, without leaving a trace. What happened, we may ask, to the divine mothers of these male deities? One of these mother-goddesses was simply interpolated in the pedigree of the Greek Zeus. According to the "Indo-European" idea Zeus was the son of Gaea, now the pedigree on his mother's part became: Gaea-Rhea-Zeus. But what about the mothers of the other gods who were merged in Zeus? Diodorus' text gives us the solution: they became the ??t??e? or nurturing nymphs of the foundling Zeus. But not only this solution was found, we may deduce quite another solution from the coins of Gortyn2). Repre- sented on them we see a dryad, successor to the Minoan goddess 1) P. Kretschmer, in Giotto 7 (1916), p. 39; F. D?mmler, s.v.

This tree-nymph unites with Zeus, who appears to her in the tree in the shape of an eagle. So here the mother of the Cretan god of the tree-cult became the consort of the Greek Zeus. Here the old-Cretan belief was adapted to the patriarchal conceptions of the Greeks. The same pattern was followed throughout. For the Cretan tree- goddess, who was called Ariadne by the "Indo-Europeans" and whose son apparently did not coincide with Zeus, but with Theseus and Dionysus, entered into a sexual relation with them. And the various elements of Ariadne's cult were brought into line with this relation. In Naxus the mournings at the death of the vegetation-god were interpreted as mournings on the occasion of the departure of their beloved Theseus; the rejoicings in Naxus at the appearance of the vegetation-god as rejoicings in honour of Dionysus, who came to make Ariadne his bride. Ariadne's epiphany in the sacred tree as a vegetation-goddess became her suicide, she hanging her- self from the tree because she had been deserted by Theseus. It is difficult to ascertain by which intermediate stages the Cretan belief reached this final result in the case of deities who were admitted to the Greek pantheon at so early a moment. It may, however, be all the better observed in the Oriental gods Aphrodite and Adonis, with whom the Greeks came into contact later on. The relation of these gods, one of mother and son in the East, was first modified into that of a vainly loving woman and an impassive youth, to end in the relation of man and wife2). That, probably, was also the way of the myth of Ariadne and that of the tree- nymph of Gortyn. I even venture to think that various other Greek romances, such as the one of Paris and Helen, Hippolytus and Phaedra, ultimately hide Cretan myths. In the myth of the two divine pairs mentioned there are traces to be found of an inter- mediate stage between the matriarchal and the patriarchal sense. We can ascertain fairly accurately the time when this modification began. For on two seal-rings, dating from Mycenaean times and found on Mycenaean soil, we see the first phase of these and simi- lar myths coming into being. They are the well-known ring from 1) L. de Brauw, Europe en de stier, Thesis, Amsterdam 1940, p. 101. 2) B. S. A.

On these rings we see the male and the female deity of the tree-cult represented in the very same scene, the only representations in which these gods appear together. This confirms the leading idea of Nilsson's book, laid down in the title: "The Mycenaean Origin of Greek Myth- ology". In the foregoing pages we discussed the way in which the Cretan religion contributed to the birth of Greek religion and mythology. In doing so we restricted ourselves to the anthropomorphism of Cretan religion. In my opinion no other way is open to us. For we are quite in the dark about the other forms of religion which the Cretans may have practised, such as fetishism, hoplolatry, dendro- latry, zoolatry, the cult of celestial bodies, ancestor cult. We do not even know if these forms of religion should be dated before, contemporaneous with or after anthropomorphism. And supposing we could collect fairly positive data on these matters, even then we should not be able to discriminate between "Indo-European" and Cretan elements, for these phenomena are so universal that the Cretan as well as the immigrating population of Greece may have known them. A different matter, maybe, is their eschatology. For the idea of Elysium is supposed to have been a Minoan idea. But the proofs of this theory are based on the interpretation of the sarcophagus of Haghia Triada and of "Nestor's ring". And the in- terpretation of both these objects is doubtful, the authenticity of the ring even being questioned. The only field in which we can arrive at anything like a positive conclusion is that of anthropo- morphism. 1) Reproduced int. al. in M. P. Nilsson, op. cit. pi. 17. 1. 2) Reproduced int. al. in M.
