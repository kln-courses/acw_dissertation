<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LINGERING DRYAD By PAUL R. HEYL U. S. Bureau of Standards THERE is an every day test which is instinctively applied when we are in doubt as to whether a certain thing is alive. We watch for it to move. This test is as old as humanity, though as now applied we introduce a logical refinement which was lacking in other days. Absence of motion, now as then, indicates absence of life, but the mere observa tion of motion does not always suggest to modern thought the presence of life. A sheet of paper may be rustled by an invisible breeze; stormy waves may arise in the ocean; the ground beneath our feet may tremble and split open; yet we of today see in such phenomena no reason for assuming life as a cause. Not so with the ancients. To them motion invariably suggested life, directly or indirectly involved. The sheet of paper, of course, was not alive, but the wind was the breath of .ZEolus. The stormy sea was the direct physical result of the wrathful strokes of Neptune's trident, and the heaving earth, by the same token, gave evidence of the displeasure of Poseidon, the earth-shaker. Though the mythology of the ancients contained much that is now regarded as childish and ridiculous, there is also to be found in it that which we must still recognize as beautiful, such as the myth of the dryad. The dryad was a tree nymph. Every tree had its protecting spirit who was born with the tree, living in or near it in intimate association, watching over its growth, and dying when the tree fell. The dryad was thus a personification of the life of the tree, and the connection between nymph and tree was far more intimate than was the case with the deities dominating sea or wind. Because of this peculiarly intimate relation the tree possessed life which the sea did not, though Neptune inhabited its depths, and which the wind did not, though set in motion by ^Eolus. The men of old, it seems, drew very much the same distinction that we do when we speak of living and nonliving substances. Water, they observed, never grew old or died, but a tree was obviously a living thing: almost one of us, growing, reproducing its kind, and eventually dying. Based upon a Presidential address given before the Philosophical Society of Washington, January, 1929, in commemoration of the hundredth anniversary of the first synthesis of an organic compound by Wohler. Originally published in the Journal of the Washing ton Academy of Sciences, Volume 19, 1929, and later reprinted in the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution.</page><page sequence="2">The Lingering Dryad 79 And as the ancients had difficulty in forming an idea of life without an animating personality there arose naturally the concept of the inseparable tree nymph. Human thinking from the first has been frankly anthropomorphic. Only in modern times has there been any notable effort to cast out anthropomorphism from our philosophy, and this struggle has not yet resulted in victory. Even today, with hereditary habits of thought heavy upon us, the concept of impersonal, physical causes is drab and unsatisfy ing, and we spell Nature with a capital N; the dryad lingers. In the chemistry of other days an interesting case is found of the persistence of this mode of thought. The old alchemists knew that wine by boiling lost its intoxicating power. Because they could see nothing escaping they said that the "spirit of wine" had found its abode too hot for it, and had taken its departure. Cassio used no figure of speech when he apostrophized the "invisible spirit of wine" by which he had been so disastrously possessed of the devil, and the name "spirit" as applied to alcohol is still in common use. With the advance of knowledge it was found that many other phe nomena besides intoxication owed their causes to inanimate, prosaic chemical compounds rather than to spirits or devils. So strong, however, is heredity that the dryad, instead of disappearing from human think ing, merely changed her form and retreated under fire to a position of advantage across a natural barrier, where she long remained in safety. It was many years before this barrier was crossed. The dividing line between organic and inorganic substances was a sharp one in the eighteenth century, and from her safe refuge in the domain of organic chemistry the dryad long watched her baffled foes. The older chemists divided the province of their science in two by a water-tight partition. All compounds with which they were acquainted could be analyzed or broken down into their elements, but not all of them could be built up again by human skill. Water might be formed from its constituents, but not sugar or starch; yet these latter substances were daily synthe sized in the laboratory of Nature, in the tissues of animal or vegetable matter; and because they were never known to occur in mineral or inorganic matter, substances of this type were called, from their origin, organic compounds. Years of experience had given rise to the belief that there existed between these two classes of substances a difference in kind rather than in degree, and that there was some reason not understood why organic compounds could not be synthesized artificially. This unknown reason was given a name; it was called the "vital force."</page><page sequence="3">80 American Scientist It often happens that when the unknown is named it appears as if it were more than half explained. The vital force once named soon came to be a familiar concept. It was held to be resident in living matter, whether animal or vegetable, much like the dryad in the tree. It was believed to differ in kind from the chemical and physical forces that governed the formation of inorganic compounds. Under the influence of this vital force it was believed that all the chemical reactions of living matter took place, and it was even supposed to govern the decomposi tions that occurred after death. The belief in a vital force of this nature was universal among eighteenth century chemists, even Berzelius being found among its adherents. The vital force seems to have been regarded with something like the awe inspired by the supernatural, and it was well into the nineteenth century before its hold on men's minds began to relax. The year 1928 marked the century of an epoch in human thought, for it was just 100 years since the doctrine of a vital force received its logical death blow. In 1828 W?hler succeeded in producing by laboratory methods the first organic compound. This was urea, which he prepared by simply heating an inorganic compound, ammonium cyanate, containing the same elements as urea, namely carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and in the same proportions. This was a body blow at the dryad, but she died hard. Her devoted adherents rallied to her support and explained away W?hler's result in various fashions. In this they were aided by the fact that for years this synthesis stood alone, suggesting that there was something excep tional about it. Some said that this proved merely that a mistake had been made; that urea was not really an organic substance, but occupied a place halfway between the organic and inorganic kingdoms. Others argued curiously that the carbon of the cyanate retained some trace or memory of the vital force which had ruled it when it had previously been a part of some organic compound. But in time other syntheses were achieved in such numbers that the accumulated evidence became overwhelming, and it was finally recognized that organic chemistry was only complicated inorganic chemistry, and that the difference between the two was one not of kind, but of degree of complexity. We have said that the dryad died hard. As a matter of fact she did not die at all; she emigrated. Dispossessed by the advancing frontier of knowledge from the domain of organic chemistry which had so long afforded her a refuge, she retreated under fire into a less understood region beyond?into the biological sciences. Here the complexity of</page><page sequence="4">The Lingering Dryad 81 phenomena was, and still is, so great that among the shadows the dryad still finds a retreat. Biologists are divided into two camps: vitalists and mechanists. Be tween them a conflict rages, and the fate of the dryad still hangs in the balance. The vitalists argue that whatever may have been the case in the past we have now, by the progress of our knowledge, reached a dividing line which really marks a difference in kind; that there have been brought to light in the realm of biology phenomena of such a nature that they are not explainable by ordinary chemical or physical principles; that it is necessary to assume a principle peculiar to living matter (in other words, a "vital force") to explain them. The mechanist, on the other hand, says that exactly the same arguments have been advanced in the past in connection with problems that seemed just as insoluble, and that these arguments have finally been disposed of by the progress of our knowledge. Differences in kind, once regarded as numerous in Nature, have slowly and steadily been resolved into dif ferences in degree. Sharp lines of demarcation have been wiped out until the line between the living and the nonliving is perhaps the only one left. Such diverse phenomena as those of electricity and light have been found to be closely akin; man himself has been shown to be one with the rest of animated Nature; and if the past is any guide to the future, it seems that even this last sharp line will some day disappear also. Perhaps the vitalist himself may not realize it, but to the student of the philosophy of history this vague "difference in kind" suggests the last lingering trace of what was once a dryad. As a cloudlet dwindles and disappears in the beams of the sun, so the dryad has shrunk to a mere wisp of vapor, which with a little more light seems destined to disappear forever. But now that we have finished pointing out the mote that is in the biologist's eye, let us examine our own clarity of vision. Are we physical scientists in any measure responsible for the lingering of the dryad? By the latter half of the nineteenth century physical theory had become a well knit, sharply crystallized, and self-sufficient body of doctrine. While it was recognized fully and generally that much was as yet unknown, it was felt quite as generally that what had been established would, with perhaps a little amendment and modification, stand forever. The physical theory of the last century was much admired by its devotees, upon whom it reacted in turn to the extent of making them at times a bit dogmatic. If there was a conflict between physics and a sister science, physics must be right.</page><page sequence="5">82 American Scientist The classical instance of this attitude is the famous controversy over the age of the earth, between the physicists on the one hand and the geologists and biologists on the other. Perhaps nothing in the annals of nineteenth century physics made such an impression upon the sister sciences. This controversy lasted for 33 years with unabated vigor, and was not finally settled until the discovery of radioactive substances. In 1862, upon the basis of the laws of the conduction of heat as laid down by Fourier, Kelvin calculated that the time that had elapsed since the earth had solidified from a molten state could not be less than 20,000,000 or more than 400,000,000 years. He admitted that rather wide limits were necessary, but was inclined to attach more weight to the lower figure than to the higher. In this he was confirmed by a similar calculation made by Helmholtz of the age of the sun. At this estimate biologists and geologists stood aghast. The prospect of having to pack into a paltry 400,000,000 years the whole progress of organic evolution from amceba to man seemed to biologists unreason able. And with the geologists the situation was still worse. It was gen erally recognized that a very long period of time must have elapsed after solidification before life of the most primitive form made its appearance, and this period, in addition to that required by evolution, must be made to fit Kelvin's Procrustean bed. Moreover, it was felt by geologists that such a view involved a return to eighteenth century ideas, from which geology was just beginning to emerge. Prior to the nineteenth century geological thought was of the catas trophic school. It was held that natural forces were more active and powerful in past geological ages than they now are; that great con vulsions of Nature had riven the crust asunder into valleys and elevated other portions into mountains. By the middle of the nineteenth century the opposite, or uniformitarian school of thought had achieved the ascendency, largely through the influence of the geologist Lyell. On this view it was held that geological processes had never differed seriously from those of the present day. As a consequence of this doctrine an immense antiquity was required for the earliest geological strata, and with this almost unlimited time at their disposal biologists felt unham pered. Then came Kelvin's bombshell. Protest and appeal were not lack ing, but Kelvin was inexorable. Physics, he said, could grant no more, and physics held the power of the purse of time. The widespread and long-continued interest in this controversy is evidenced by the many letters published on the subject in Nature from January to April, 1895. As proof of the fact that Kelvin did not</page><page sequence="6">The Lingering Dryad 83 stand alone in this matter it is of interest to note that not a single physicist failed to support him in theory, though there was a general feeling that perhaps his limits might be widened somewhat. The dis cussion was finally summed up by its initiator, Professor John Perry, who expressed the opinion that the upper limit assigned by Kelvin might perhaps be multiplied by four. But this concession brought about iio rapprochement. The two sides were not near enough to dicker. A few years later the deadlock was finally resolved by the discovery of radioactivity. This new and totally unexpected source of terrestrial heat nullified Kelvin's fundamental postulate, and allowed as much time as the most extreme views could require. Rightly or wrongly, this celebrated case had an unfortunate effect upon interscientific relations. The biologists, in particular, felt that the character of their problems and the evidence for their conclusions were not appreciated by the physicists. The impression was gained that physics was for some reason incompetent to treat of biological ques tions, and that the life sciences required for their complete discussion and development something that was not and could not be found in physical theory. It may scarcely be doubted, I think, that this impres sion of the inadequacy of physics went far toward strengthening and prolonging the life of the vitalistic hypothesis. But, to be fair, we must recognize that the vitalism of today is not that of a century ago. To use a term borrowed from mineralogy, it is but a pseudomorph of its predecessor, cast in the mold of the older form and simulating its outward shape, but inwardly of a different com position. The neovitalist of today disclaims utterly anything savoring of the occult or the supernatural; short of this, he is ready to accept any adequate explanation of life. He maintains, however, with equal firm ness that even modern physical theory lacks something necessary to explain vital phenomena; that no interplay of atoms, however com plicated, can account for the simplest manifestation of life. In brief, the vitalist looks outward for the explanation of life; the mechanist looks inward. The attitude of the mechanist is, for the present, largely one of faith and hope rather than sight. He admits that modern physical theory affords no explanation of life, and that .there is no reason to believe we are any nearer a solution now than we were a century ago. But, en couraged by precedent, he holds steadily his faith that some new and unexpected discovery may at any time clear our vision as radioactivity clarified that of our predecessors. And he is confident that when the</page><page sequence="7">84 American Scientist solution of this mystery is reached it will be found to be internal rather than external. But while we are waiting for something of this kind to happen, may we by any chance find some foreshadowing of a possible common ground in existing physical theory? Let us imagine, if we can, some one whose physical experience has been limited to solids and who is ignorant of molecules and atoms. The latter will not be so difficult when it is remembered that it has not been so very long ago that we were all ignorant of any subatomic structure. Matter, to our supposed observer, is continuous and infinitely divisible without alteration in its properties; its structure is perfectly uniform to the last conceivable degree. Suppose further that he observes for the first time the melting of a solid. In this process the thing which would probably impress him most would be its abruptness, its sharp initiation. By continual influx of heat the solid suffers a steady rise of temperature, which seems as though it might continue indefinitely so long as heat is supplied. But suddenly, without warning or apparent cause, a critical point is reached. Though the influx of heat is not halted the temperature stops rising. A new effect is seen, different in kind from any phenomenon known in solids. We say that the body is undergoing a change of state and is becoming a liquid. In this new state new laws govern its behavior; new properties are evident, differing in kind, not in degree, from those of solids. Our unsophisticated observer might well wonder at this curious behavior; but should we, from our superior knowledge, attempt to tell him that this difference in appearance and behavior is not a matter of composition or outside forces, but of internal structure, we might find him rather incredulous. "No," he might say. "Something has happened to stop the rise of temperature. There has been an introduction of a new factor into the situation. You speak of structural difference. I do not understand you. The structure of a solid, as I am familiar with it, could not be more simple than it is?continuous, infinitely divisible, uniform throughout, with no shade of difference anywhere upon which to build up an explana tion. No, we must look outside for the cause of this change. Liquid phenomena are not expressible in terms of the properties of solids. He who maintains that they are is a mechanist." This belief might be confirmed if he pushed the heating of the liquid far enough. At a second critical point, again unheralded and without apparent reason, the liquid begins to boil, and the resulting gas exhibits a new set of phenomena, differing in kind from anything to be found</page><page sequence="8">The Lingering Dryad 85 in either solids or liquids. The new phenomena in this case depart even more widely from those of the other states than was the case at the first critical point. To us, with our knowledge of molecules, the explanation of these critical points and different states is comparatively simple and inter nal. It is true that the phenomena of one state are not to be expressed in terms of the properties of another; the behavior of gases can not be deduced from the laws of elastic solids or of incompressible liquids. The solution does not lie in a line joining one state to another, but goes back from each state to the common basis of molecular structure under lying all states, something of which our observer is yet to become aware. And until a similar common ground for the phenomena of living and nonliving matter is recognized there must be a difference of opinion between the vitalist and the mechanist. What this common basis may be we can not as yet surmise. It remains for some new discovery to open our eyes. It must be some thing deeper and more fundamental than molecules or atoms. In so far the vitalist is right; and in so far as he maintains that the mere interplay of atoms contains the key to the mystery, the mechanist is wrong. But such a common basis, underlying and forming part of non living as well as living matter, would be an internal factor, and it is for such a factor that the mechanist is looking. The parallel here suggested is worth pushing farther. The past his tory of Nature has been one of change, of growth, of that develop ment which we call evolution. Her future, if hindsight is to be trusted, will carry this evolution onward to a consummation of which we can form no conception as yet. Nature, we may say, has been steadily warm ing up to her work since the beginning of things. And in this warming up process several critical stages may be distinguished, strangely sug gestive of the different states of matter. The first of these critical points was reached millions of years ago, when life first made its appearance: a totally new phenomenon super imposed upon inanimate Nature. For untold ages life was impossible on the earth, but eventually, when conditions allowed, life appeared, no one knows how. With this appearance new phenomena not to be found in inorganic Nature began to show themselves. With the advent of the organic, new motives of action are recognizable, and new combinations are possible. The vitalist explains this by bringing in a mysterious something from the outside; the mechanist is persuaded that matter in acquiring life has not ceased to be a conservative system; only in its behavior is it transformed.</page><page sequence="9">86 American Scientist Moreover, this transformation has not been complete. Living and nonliving matter exist side by side and will probably continue to do so. The physicist would call this the coexistence of two phases at one temperature, like a mixture of ice and water at the freezing point, each following its own laws and exhibiting its own characteristic properties under the same environment. We may, perhaps, by poetic license think of the first beginnings of life as feeling strange and lonely in the midst of the nonliving matter surrounding them, so different in properties, in behavior. And perhaps we may imagine that the works and ways of nonliving matter occa sionally grated on the sensibilities of the living, and called forth the protest: "Why are you so mechanical? Why not show a little flexibility occasionally?" But this protest, we may imagine, was wasted. "It is my ancient way," replied nonliving Nature. "The way I did for millions of years before you newcomers appeared upon the scene. I can not mend my case. Why not do as I do and be sociable?" But this is just what living matter will not do. Like white men in the Tropics, it maintains its standard of living among an overwhelming majority of an inferior grade of civilization. Many years have passed. Life is no longer a newcomer, a feeble colony, but has waxed mighty, and has become the outstanding feature of the earth's surface. And now a second critical point is reached. Life has attained such a degree of complexity that a new set of phenomena is beginning to make its appearance, something different in kind from any thing that has been before; as different in its turn as was life itself com pared to inanimate matter; something superimposed upon life as life of old was superimposed upon the nonliving. And it is, appropriately enough, in man, the highest type of life, the flower of creation, the peak of evolution, "the heir of all the ages in the foremost rank of time," that this new thing first makes itself manifest?a moral sense, an ethical feeling, which often finds itself as much a stranger in its environment as life must have felt among the crystals and colloids among which it began its existence. If we must find a single word to express this new quality let us call it "Soul." Within us is developing a new thing, as wonderful as life itself and no less rich in possibilities. Life in its turn has brought forth something of a higher order, transcending itself, as it once transcended nonliving matter. And that this new thing has elected to make its appearance in and through us, the highest of Nature's children, what is more reason able ? Do men gather figs of thistles ? But here the vitalist takes his last stand. "I know," says he, "that</page><page sequence="10">The Lingering Dryad 87 past history points your way; that one step after another, I have been forced to give ground. I, who once held that no one but God could make an organic compound, have lived to see it done by high-school students. You mechanists, on the other hand, have pressed steadily forward. But beware lest, flushed with success and intoxicated with power, you attempt too much and achieve your own downfall. What you tell me now goes beyond all bounds of credence. Am I to understand that all that makes a man, his ethics, his poetry, his music, his aspirations, his ideals, are from within? Are these, too, of the earth, earthy? Never! These, at last, must come from without. Can ideals rise higher than their source?" Of the earth, earthy! But why should there be anything mean or unworthy about that which comes from within rather than from with out? Is the macrocosm essentially nobler than the microcosm? True, tradition runs that way. Man at different times has set his gods in the most inaccessible places, on the summit of Mount Olympus, or across the rainbow bridge in Asgard; but the greatest idealist that our race has produced broke with this tradition when he said: "The kingdom of God is within you." And perhaps it may be true that ideals can rise higher than their apparent source. Just as every great genius had parents of less than his own ability, who yet in some mysterious way endowed him with more than they themselves possessed, so Nature has produced within us something without precedent in the life history of the earth. And as a parent watches with pride a child who gives early promise of outdistancing his elders, so Mother Nature may be watching us. What is this new thing which Nature has brought forth, and with the development of which we have been intrusted? No man can say, but it is a fair inference that it will go far. Life has gone far from a tiny speck of protoplasm; who knows to what lengths this new thing, this mind, this soul, if you will, may carry us? For it doth not yet appear what we shall be.</page></plain_text>
