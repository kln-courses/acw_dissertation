<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SEPTUAGINT AS HOLY WRIT AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE TRANSLATORS * HARRY M. ORLINSKY Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, New York A FTER thirty years in the business of Bible translation—since June 1945 as a member of the Committee responsible for the Old Testa ment part of the Revised Standard Version, and since June 1955 as a member of the Committee to translate the Hebrew Bible for the Jewish Publication Society of America—I have come to the conclusion that whoever wishes to gain a better comprehension of the textual criticism of the Bible, i.e., among other things, to make proper use of such ancient primary translations as the Septuagint, Targum, Peshitta, and Vulgate— and for that matter, any such daughter versions as the Old Latin, Armen ian, Ethiopie, Syro-Hexapla, and Arabic—would do well first to attempt seriously the role of translator. If he cannot latch on to one of the several authorized or commercial quasi-academic committees, let him translate a biblical Book on his own private authority. He will then come to understand and appreciate the many problems that beset the Septuagint translators, the translators into other tongues, and their fellow translators since.1 We are fortunate that it was individuals who translated the biblical Books into Greek; and even when a Book was translated by two men, they each worked on a different portion of the Book, the second Septuagint translator beginning where the first left off.2 So that when * This essay represents, sometimes in more elaborate form (e.g., the section on the "divine" origin of the Septuagint), parts of the first of the three Grinfield Lectures on the Septuagint that I delivered at Oxford University during April 29 May 2, 1974. The subject of the Series as a whole was "The Septuagint as a Jewish Translation of the Hebrew Bible." I take this opportunity to express my thanks to the Electors of the Grinfield Lectureship for electing me Lecturer for 1973-74, and to Prof. G. D. Kilpatrick, Chairman of the Electors and Rector of Queen's College, for sundry courtesies. 1 It is obvious that a Julius Wellhausen, Stanley Rolles Driver, or Max Leopold Margolis did not have to become a translator to demonstrate excellence as a textual critic; also, that experience as a translator of a biblical Book hardly guarantees a scholar competence as a textual critic. Nevertheless, the statement made here would appear to be justified. 2 H. St. John Thackeray is apparently the first modem scholar to treat 89</page><page sequence="2">90 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [2] the modern scholar studies the Septuagint translation of a Book of the Bible, he is studying the work and temperament of one man. This is true not only of the Septuagint; individual authorship was widely held also in connection with both the composition and the translation of biblical Books generally: Moses was the sole author of the Torah, Joshua of his Book, Solomon of the book of Proverbs, and the like; Onkelos alone was responsible for the Targum of the Torah; the grandson of Ben Sira relates how he turned his grandfather's Hebrew composition into Greek; Jonathan ben Uzziel is credited with writing another Targum of the Bible; individuals like Theodotion, Aquila, and Symmachus were associated each with a Greek version of the Bible; Origen, Lucian, this aspect of the Septuagint systematically; see his studies—under "Notes and Studies"—of "The Greek Translators of Jeremiah," .. of Ezekiel," and "... of the Prophetical Books" in JThSt, 4 (1902-03), 245-266 (see in n. 3 on pp. 245 f. the reference to several scholars who had studied Jeremiah from this point of view), 398-411, and 578-585; "The Greek Translators of the Four Books of Kings," 8 (1907), 262-278 (where inter alia the view that I Ki. 2.12-21.43 was translated by a single person is accepted by J. W. Wevers, OTS, 8 [1950], 300, n. 1); "The Bisection of Books in Primitive Septuagint MSS.," 9 (1907 08), 88-98 (reprinted on pp. 459-469 of Studies in the Septuagint: Origins, Recensions,Recensions, and Interpretations. Selected Essays with a Prolegomenon by Sidney Jellicoe (in KTAV's Library of Biblical Studies, 1974); and his review of R. R. Ottley's The Book of Isaiah according to the Septuagint (Codex Alexan drinus),drinus), 10 (1909), 299-304 (one person translated all of Isaiah); also his important Schweich Lectures for 1920, The Septuagint and Jewish Worship (1921), where much of the articles listed above was reworked. G. B. Gray, "The Greek Version of Isaiah: Is It the Work of a Single Translator?" JThSt, 12(1911), 286-293, as against Thackeray, argued for two translators for Isaiah (as did Baumgârtel; see below); but J. Ziegler, Unter suchungensuchungen zur Septuaginta des Bûches Isaias (in Alttestamentliche Abhandlun gen,gen, XII, 3 [1934]), Chap. II, "Die Einheit der Js-LXX" (pp. 31^16), found it difficult to decide between the two positions and wondered whether a single translator had before him and made use of a previous translation of at least parts of the Book. Following on a brief discussion by J. Schâfers in 1909 on Ezekiel ("1st das Buch Ezechiel in der LXX von einem oder mehreren Dol metchem iibersetzt?" in Theologie und Glaube, pp. 289-291), J. Herrmann and F. Baumgârtel worked up a detailed analysis of Ezekiel (Herrmann), Isaiah (Baumgârtel), Minor Prophets (H. and B.; contrast Ziegler's "Die Einheit der Septuaginta zum Zwôlfprophetenbuch," in Beilage zum Vorlesungsverzeichnis der der Staatl. Akademie zu Braunsberg, W.-S. 1934/35, 16 pp.), and Pentateuch (B.) in their Beitràge zur Entstehungsgeschichte der Septuaginta (BWAT, N.F. 5 [1923]). In the meantime, Karl Huber published his dissertation on UntersuchungenUntersuchungen iiber den Sprachcharakter des griechischen Leviticus (Giessen, 1916); and in 1938 Sherman E. Johnson published his dissertation on The Septuagint Septuagint Translators of Amos (Univ. of Chicago). However, the literature on the subject is now considerable, and a critical survey of the discussions and methodology of "the two-(and even three") translator" theory of a single Book is now very much in order.</page><page sequence="3">[3] SEPTUAGINT AS HOLY WRIT 91 and Hesychius3 were identified each with a recension of the Septuagint translation; and Hieronymus was the sole author of the Vulgate. This assertion holds true even for the well-known statement in the Babylonian Talmud, Baba Bathra 14b (bottom)-15a, about the author ship of the Books of the Bible: And who wrote them [the Books of the Bible] down?4 Moses wrote down his own Book, and the section of Balaam [Num. 22 24], and Job. Joshua wrote down his own Book and [the last] 3 In his article on "Proto-Septuagint Studies" (in the Seed of Wisdom : Essays Essays in Honour of T. J. Meek, ed. W. S. McGullough [Univ. of Toronto Press, 1964] 58-77; now reproduced in Studies in the Septuagint, etc., ed. S. Jellicoe, pp. 138-157), pp. 59 f. and n. 9, J. W. Wevers, in maintaining that Hesychius is a "shadowy figure" (J. H. Ropes' phrase), holds that "Orlinsky wrongly objects to this characterization of Hesychius." But this was not the nuance of my objection; for after citing Swete, Rahlfs, Montgomery, Ropes, Gehman, and Ziegler, I concluded (HUCA, 33[1962], 120 f., n. 6) : "Yet too much should not really be made of the lack of sufficient data about the life of Hesychius. Very little more is known about several such scholars, e.g., Theodo tion and Symmachus; fortunately for the last two, enough of their work has been preserved and identified for their own existence to be regarded as less than shadowy; yet Hesychius' existence is surely not more shadowy than theirs." So that while citing with approval the pithy assertion of Frederic G. Kenyon (in his study of "Hesychius and the Text of the New Testament") that "The title of 'Hesychius' rests in fact upon what is little more than a shadow of a shade," B. M. Metzger in his survey of "The Lucianic Recension of the Greek Bible" begins the second paragraph with the statement, "Little is known of the life of Lucian of Antioch..."; and he goes on: "Many are the historical and theological problems connected with the person and influence of Lucian of Antioch. The question has even been raised as to whether Lucian the excommunicated heretic was the same person as Lucian the martyr and Biblical scholar..." In fine: if Hesychius is to be described as a shadowy figure, why should not some of the others be similarly described? Why should he be singled out? Metzger's article may be found on pp. 270-291 of Studies in the Septuagint, etc., ed. S. Jellicoe. In this same volume may be found also, e.g., A. Vaccari's article on "The Hesychian Recension of the Septuagint," pp. 336-342 (reprinted from Biblica,Biblica, 46 [1965], 60-66), which constituted a response to S. Jellicoe's article on "The Hesychian Recension Reconsidered" (JBL, 82 [1963], 409-418), as well as to the negative attitudes of such scholars as Rahlfs and Ziegler. Father Vaccari's conclusion is : "... I think that we are justified in saying that there are indications of the Hesychian recension of the Septuagint in the textual tradition of the Old Testament." 4 The meaning of katab in this whole discussion has been variously under stood as "to compose, to author, write, write down, direct/authorize/order the writing down, put into writing, transcribe, copy, record, compile, edit, publish" —yes, even "canonize"! I find that "write down, put into writing"—which need not exclude authorship as well—serves well every instance of katab both here and in the pertinent discussions that precede and follow. Thus Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Jeremiah, and Ezra all composed Books which they (themselves or someone under their direction) also put into writing. On the other hand, Moses did not compose—he simply wrote down, recorded—the</page><page sequence="4">92 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [4] eight verses in the Torah [dealing with the death of Moses]. Samuel wrote down his own Book, and Judges, and Ruth. David wrote down the book of Psalms on behalf of5 ten elders: Adam [lit. the first man], Melchizedek, Abraham, Moses, Heman, Jedu thun, Asaph, and the three sons of Korah. Jeremiah wrote down his own Book, and the book of Kings, and Lamentations. Hezekiah and his associates6 wrote down Isaiah, Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes. The Men of the Great Assembly wrote down Ezekiel, the Twelve [Minor Prophets], Daniel, and the Scroll of Esther. Ezra wrote down his own Book.. .7יי Balaam Speeches, nor hardly the book of Job (even if—see the discussion of the rabbis that follows, 15ab—it was composed in time for Moses to have had it put into writing); Samuel may have merely put the books of Judges and Ruth into writing, without having composed them; David composed his own Psalms, but not those of the Ten Elders which he added to his own; Hezekiah and his associates did not compose Isaiah, Proverbs, etc., any more than the Men of the Great Assembly composed Ezekiel, the Minor Prophets, etc.—they simply had them written down. A related problem in the Letter of Aristeas is a bit more complicated because more than one term is involved. I have in mind arj/iaivm (§§30, 314), tcqo-, ôi-,ôi-, fiiOeQfirjvévco and fiera-, àvri-, àvaygâqxo. I believe that otj/iaivco can mean "translate" no more than katab can mean "canonize"; only scholars who are desperate in defending an insupportable theory can force such meanings into these words; égf1r!veva1 and its derivatives are to be associated with "translation, interpretation" (the two meanings are not necessarily synonymous!); and ygagpro and its derivatives deal with "copy, transcribe, record, put into writing, write down." But this requires a separate study; see in the meantime the discussions reproduced in Studies in the Septuagint, ed. Jellicoe, under § II (ii) : D. W. Gooding ("Aristeas and Septuagint Origins: a Review of Recent Studies"), pp. 158-180; V. Tcherikover ("The Ideology of the Letter of Aristeas"), 181-207; and G. Zuntz ("Aristeas Studies II: Aristeas on the Translation of the Torah"), 208-225. All three studies offer considerable pertinent bibliography. 5 The phrase כתב . . . על־ידי is elusive; among other renderings that have been proposed are: "for; including; with the assistance of; at/under the direction of." The usual rendering of the preposition, "by, through"—cf., e.g., the well known phrase, ועל־ידי עבדיך הנביאים כתוב לאמר "And by/through Your servants the prophets it is written"—hardly applies here. 6 Other renderings that have been—or could be—offered for סיעא are "company, group, colleagues, followers, assistants." I wonder whether there is something in the statement in the Letter (§ 302) that the result of the joint labors of the translators was then "transcribed by [so Thackerayj/reduced to writing under the direction of [so Hadas] Demetrius" (to ôè ix xrjç ov/irpwviaç yivopevovyivopevov ngenôvxatç dvayoacpfjç ovxûç £xvy%ave naqà rov Ar]pr)TQioi1) that helps explain the expression : David כתב על ידי. 7 ומי כתבן, משה כתב ספרו ופרשת בלעם ואיוב, יהושע כתב ספרו ושמונה פסוקים שבתורה, שמואל כתב ספרו ושופטים ורות, דוד כתב ספר תהלים ע"י עשרת זקנים, ע"י אדם הראשון על ידי מלכי צדק ועל ידי אברהם וע"י משה ועל ידי הימן וע"י ידותון ועל ידי אסף ועל ידי שלשה בני קרח, ירמיה כתב ספרו וספר מלכים וקינות, חזקיה וסיעתו כתבו ישעיה משלי שיר השירים וקהלת, אנשי כנסת הגדולה כתבו יחזקאל ושנים עשר דניאל ומגילת אסתר, ועזרא כתב את ספרו ...</page><page sequence="5">[5] SEPTUAGINT AS HOLY WRIT 93 In no single instance, it will be noted, are two or more persons—let alone a committee—credited with the joint authorship of a Book or of any part of a Book: none of Moses and Balaam, or Moses and Joshua, or Samuel and any of the Judges (or Ruth), or David and any of the Ten Elders, or Hezekiah and Isaiah, or the Men of the Great Assembly and Ezekiel, or Ezra and Nehemiah—none was a joint co-author of any part of the Bible. The Letter of Aristeas, on the other hand, plainly talks of joint co-authorship of the Greek translation of the Torah. No less striking in the Letter, even startling, is the assertion that a committee of seventy-two elders, six from each of the twelve tribes of Israel, cooperated in the making of the Septuagint. For everyone knew at the time—the Bible itself was a source for this—that the tribes—at least ten of them—had ceased to exist half a millennium previously! Why, when he could have credited one man—albeit ficti tiously—with translating what one man, Moses, was credited with writing, did the author of the Letter resort to rather obvious fiction in crediting the Septuagint to representatives of the long extinct tribes of Israel?8 It would seem that the answer to the above and other questions is to be found in the basic reason for composing the Letter in the first 8 These and related problems are dealt with by Tcherikover (pp. 196 f.), and I accept fully his overall explanation: "...the [Sepuagint] translation... is Aristeas' main subject in the Letter. He makes every effort to prove the sanctity of the translation." But the reader will note where Tcherikover over looked the several specific points of contact between the canonization of the Septuagint and that of the Torah, constituting Aristeas' proof that the Septuagint was as divinely revealed as the Hebrew original. In 1947 (in "Current Progress and Problems in Septuagint Research," in The The The Study of the Bible Today and Tomorrow, ed. H. R. Willoughby, p. 20, n. 23; reprinted in Studies in the Septuagint, ed. Jellicoe, p. 161), I wrote about Otto Stâhlin's detailed contribution to W. von Christ's Geschichte der griechischen Litteratur,Litteratur, ed. W. Schmid, "that in no one section of this reference monograph (pp. 535-656, ,Die hellenistisch-jiidische Litteratur') is there any indication that the vast range of the fundamentally important literature produced by the Jews in Hebrew and Aramaic in the postbiblical period has been worked ... there is also the no less grave error of 'commission,' viz., the prejudice against the idea that the Jews in the intertestamental period could and did write reliable history. It is the direct continuation of the work and spirit of Schiirer... who branded so much of the (all-important rabbinic) literature which he did not know directly as 'Jewish Propaganda under a heathen Mask' when, in reality, Schiirer himself was guilty of 'anti-Jewish propaganda under a scholarly mask'..." The malice of Schiirer was noted by Tcherikover subsequently (op. cit., p. 181; originally in 1958, in Harvard Theological Review, vol. 51, p. 59): "Schiirer classes the Letter with a special kind of literature, 'Jewish Propaganda in Pagan disguise,' whose works are 'directed to the pagan reader, in order to make propaganda for Judaism among the Gentiles."' On Aristeas in general, see the fine survey in S. Jellicoe, The Septuagint and Modern Study (1968), Chap, n (pp. 29-58).</page><page sequence="6">94 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [6] place: the strong desire to accord the Septuagint version of the Torah the same sanctity and authority long held by the Hebrew original—in a word, to certify to the "divine" origin of the Septuagint. For Whom Was the Letter of Aristeas Composed? The Septuagint as Holy Writ The author of the Letter made use of identical or similar expressions and circumstances for the making of the Septuagint that the Hebrew Bible did for the making of the Torah. Thus in the all-important matters of canonization and of the protection of the laws and regulations as pre served in the text, I noted long ago that the Hebrew phrase "to read aloud to (lit. to read in the ears/hearing of) the people" (קרא ... באזני העם), usually followed by an expression of consent by the assembly, describes the biblical procedure in designating a document as official and binding, in other words, as divinely inspired, as Sacred Scripture.9 Thus Ex. 24.3-7 relates: 3 Moses went and repeated to all the people all the commands and all the rules of the Lord; and all the people answered with one voice: "All the things that the Lord has commanded we will do!"do!" ... 7 Then he took the document [Heb. sefer, traditional "book5'] of the covenant and read it aloud to the people. And they said, "All that the Lord has spoken we will faithfully do!" Again, when the document that the priest Hilkiah said he came upon accidentally in the Temple (about 621 B.C.E.) was read by the scribe Shaphan to King Josiah (II Ki. 22-23), the king—in order to make the document officially binding upon all Israel—summoned 23. 1... all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 2 The king went up to the House of the Lord, together with all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people (וכל־העם), young and old. And he read aloud to them (ויקרא באזניהם) all the words of the document which had been discovered in the House of the Lord. 3 And the king... confirmed the covenant... and all the people entered into the covenant. 9 "The Septuagint—its Use in Textual Criticism," Bib. Arch., IX, 2 (May, 1946), 22 f. I have dealt with this subject recently in greater detail, "The Canoni zation of the Bible and the Exclusion of the Apocrypha" (1974), pp. 257 ff. (chap. 15) in my Essays; the biblical material adduced here derives from this essay.</page><page sequence="7">[7] SEPTUAGINT AS HOLY WRIT 95 Or compare Jer. 36.1-10, when Jeremiah instructed Baruch as follows: 55 .. .1 am in hiding: I cannot go to the House of the Lord. 6 So you go and read aloud from the scroll to the people in the House of the Lord on the fast day the words of the Lord that you wrote at my dictation (וקראת ...באזני העם); you shall also read them aloud to all the Judeans (באזני כל־יהודה) who have come from their towns .. .10 And Baruch read aloud to all the people (ויקרא ...באזני כל*העם) from the document (ספר) the words of Jeremiah... Small wonder that the rejection of this official, canonized document by King Jehoiakim and his government (about 600 B.C.E.) brought on terrible retribution at the hands of God (w. 23-24 and 30). And finally, for our present purpose, Neh. 8.1-6 informs us that the Torah was formally declared Sacred Scripture in the days of Ezra Nehemiah (5th cent. B.C.E.) : 1 All the people gathered as one man into the square in front of the Water Gate and asked Ezra the Scribe to bring the document of the Torah of Moses... 2 Ezra the priest brought the Torah before the assembly... 3 and read from it ... from early morning until noon in the presence of the men and women... and [in] the hearing of all the people (6 ...(ויקרא־בו ...נגד ...ואזני כל־העם Ezra then blessed the Lord... and all the people replied, "Amen, Amen!"... The biblical expression for "to canonize" is precisely the phrase employed in the Letter to indicate that the Septuagint, exactly as the Hebrew Torah, was canonized. Not only that; the biblical injunction to preserve the divine Hebrew text that contains God's laws to Israel is likewise employed by Aristeas in connection with the Greek text of the Septua gint. Deut. 4.1-2 reads: And now, O Israel, give heed to the laws and regulations which I am instructing you to observe.. .2 You shall not add anything to what I command you or take anything away from it..." Here is how the Letter puts it, both for the canonization and the preservation of the text (§§ 308-311) : When the work (of translation) was completed, Demetrius as sembled the Jewish people... and read it aloud9® to the entire 9a The Greek term for "to read aloud/out/through," naoavay qvu'xjxm, is used, in the same sense, also in §§42 (see below, n. 13), 299, and 312, as well as in II Macc. 8.23 (where such modern versions as RSV, Jerusalem Bible, NEB, and NAB render "read aloud") and III Macc. 1.12; cf., e.g., H. G. Meecham,</page><page sequence="8">96 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [8] gathering. And after the rolls had been read aloud, the priests and the elders of the translators and some of the corporate body and the leaders of the people rose up and said, "Inasmuch as the translation has been well and piously made and is in every respect accurate, it is right that it should remain in its present form and no revision of any sort take place." When all had assented to what had been said, they bade that an imprecation be pronounced, according to their custom, upon any who should revise the text by adding or transposing anything whatever in what had been written down, or by making any excision.. .10 One may well ask at this point: would any but a Jewish reader under stand that such expressions as "read aloud to the entire gathering... When the rolls had been read, the priests and the elders of the translators... and the leaders of the people... rose up and said ... When all had assented to what had been said..."—indeed the entire context—indicated not merely that "The action of representative officials is calculated to give the version public and binding authority" (Hadas)—this is a hellenistic-academic way of comprehending it all—but specifically the significant idea of canonization? I have rendered to nlrjOoç rwv ,Iovôaiœv (beginning of § 308) not by the usual, and bland, "the community of the Jews" but by "the Jewish people," following Meecham's observation (p. 305 ad loc.) that the phrase is used here (as elsewhere, e.g., in I and II Macc. and in Acts) "in an official sense." The Letter of Aristeas needs fresh study from the point of view of a Hellenistic Jew, as against that of a Jewish Hellenist. The divine origin of the Septuagint is exactly the point that Aristeas made in §§ 312-316 immediately following, in connection with two alleged previous interpretations or translations of some parts of the text of the Torah. As he tells it (§§ 312-313), after the just-completed The The The Letter of Aristeas: A Linguistic Study with Special Reference to the Greek Bible Bible (1935), p. 209, §42: "mxQavéyvœpev. Classical] word used in late sense 'to read over (in public)'. Cf " In this connection, Meecham has also noted (p. 306 top, §310) that the simpler form àvnyiyvdiiyy.m too "was regularly used in both cl. and later Gk. to denote 'reading aloud'. Cf. I Macc. x, 7; Lk. iv, 16 [Jesus reading aloud from the scroll in the synagogue on the sabbath]; I Thess. v, 27 al.; pap." In the Septuagint, the rendering for קרא ,, . באזני is regularly (and literally) àvayiyvtoaxto ... iv ihol/eîç rà (bra; this "hebraism" appears in I Macc. 10.7. 10 The translation of the Letter given here, and generally, unless indicated otherwise, is that of Hadas. The much-disputed theory that at least one earlier Greek translation of the Torah is indicated here need not detain us at this point; our immediate interest is primarily the divine origin and authority of the Septuagint. Cf. the articles of Gooding, Tcherikover, and Zuntz cited in n. 4 above.</page><page sequence="9">[9] SEPTUAGINT AS HOLY WRIT 97 Septuagint translation of the Torah was read aloud (or:out) to the king "and he was exceedingly amazed at the mind of [Moses] the lawgiver," he asked Demetrius, "How is it that when such great things have been achieved, none of the historians or poets ever thought of mentioning them?" To which Demetrius replied, "Because the Law is holy and has been given by God, and some of those who attempted to do so were smitten of God and desisted from their attempt." The account continues —the mention of "historians or poets" having prepared the reader for a reference to at least one of each (§§ 314-316) : Indeed, he said, he had heard Theopompus say that when he was on the point of introducing into his history certain matters which had previously been translated from the Law, too rashly,11 he suffered a derangement of the mind for more than thirty days; upon the abatement of the disorder he implored God that the cause of what had befallen be made plain to him, and when it was signified to him in a dream that it was his meddlesome desire to disclose divine matters to common men, he desisted, and was thereupon restored to health. "And of Theodectes also, the tragic poet, I have heard," he added, "that when he was on the point of introducing into one of his plays something recorded in the Book (or Bible), his vision was afflicted with a cataract. Con ceiving the suspicion that this was the reason for his calamity, he implored God and after many days recovered." Again, regardless of whether any such translations had ever been at tempted or made—incidentally both the Theopompus and the Theo dectes referred to here lived in the 4th century B.C.E., and the account about them is in all probability fictitious—the whole thrust of Demetrius' reply to the king, indeed, the very reason that the account of the two "translations" (or interpretations) was introduced in the first place, was that the Septuagint version was the first, and only, Greek translation (or any translation, for that matter) of His Holy Law that God had authorized. It was, simply put, no less divinely inspired than the Hebrew original of Moses.12 11 On the syntax here, see the remarks by Gooding (p. 180) and his references to Jellicoe and Zuntz. 12 In "The Septuagint: A Little Known Fact about the First Translation of the Torah" (Essays, chap. 20, pp. 383-386), I noted that the Jewish attitude toward the Septuagint—just like everything else—was determined by the social forces that obtained at any given time; the destruction of Judea's sovereignty and the growth of Christianity made for the decisive turning point after the turn of the Era. Prior to that combination of events, the Septuagint was held in the highest esteem by the Jewish community as a whole; thus both Philo and Josephus used the Septuagint as their Bible and praised its great merits, Philo</page><page sequence="10">98 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [10] When Moses received from God on Mount Sinai what Jewish tradition came to identify as the Torah, 3 Moses went and repeated to all the people all the commands and all the rules of the Lord; and all the people answered with one voice: "All the things that the Lord has commanded we will do!" 4 Moses then wrote down all the commands of the Lord. Early in the morning, he set up an altar at the foot of the Mount, with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel... 7 Then he took the document of the covenant and read it aloud to the people. And they said, "AH that the Lord has spoken we will faithfully do!"... 9 Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy elders of Israel ascended [the Mount], 10 and they saw the God of of Israel... (Ex. 24.3-10). The main reason, then, that the author of the Letter involved the twelve tribes of Israel, through their elders, in the translation of the Torah was that it was the twelve tribes, through their elders, that were involved in the Revelation of the Torah in the first place. By the same token, "When we received your letter,,י Eleazar is said to have replied to King Ptolemy, "... we assembled our entire people and read it aloud to them... we straightway offered sacrifices... and the entire multitude prayed ... And in the presence of all we selected elders good and true..." In other words, following the example at Sinai, all the Jews of Judea authorized the making of the Septuagint.13 describing the translators as "inspired prophets." And the rabbis (Megillah 9b), quoting Gen. 9.27 ("May God enlarge Japheth//And let him dwell in the tents of Shem"), i.e., recalling Japheth as the ancestor of the Greeks and Shem as the ancestor of the Israelites, cleverly interpreted the verse to mean that it was good that Israel's Torah was rendered into Greek. And when mention is made in the rabbinic literature of the language (or the alphabet) in which phylacteries, mezuzot, and the Torah may be written, Greek is parti cularly held in esteem, second only to Hebrew. After the turning point, it was possible for the rabbis to assert (Masseket Soferim ["Tractate of Scribes"], 1,7) : "The day on which the Greek translation was made was as difficult for Israel as the day on which Israel made the Golden Calf in the wilderness; for the Torah could not be translated adequately." 13 The elders are praised extremely lavishly. At the suggestion of his librarian Demetrius (§32), King Ptolemy requests Eleazar, the High Priest of the lews at Jerusalem, to "choose elders of exemplary life who possess skill in the law and ability to translate, six from each tribe..." (§39). Eleazar informs Ptolemy that "we assembled our entire people and read [the King's letter] aloud to them... And in the presence of all we selected elders good and true, six from each tribe... Their names are..." (§§ 41-51).

While Aristeas had to have all twelve tribes of Israel participate in the making of the Septuagint, he had to content himself with listing them simply as " (Their names [i.e., of the elders] are), of the first tribe/' "of the second," "of the third," etc. (§§ 47-50).. Fortunately for him, it was not necessary to extend the fiction of the twelve tribes by specifying "of the tribe of Reuben," "of the tribe of Simeon," etc. There is more. In the biblical account of the Revelation at Sinai, the elders constituted mere witnesses to the event; their roles were quite passive. In the Letter, on the other hand, after the Torah itself is lauded for containing "such great things," the qualities of the elders are praised—even by Hellenistic standards—beyond the usual literary amenities. There is good reason for this: the elders in the Letter were not mere witnesses to the event of the translation, they were the authors of the event; they personally brought the Greek Torah into being! And for that—not because of the desire or need to impress non-Jews with the greatness of the Law and its Jewish interpreters, or because current Hellenistic style demanded it—they are described as the most learned in God's Law, and (but only secondarily) in wordly (i.e., Greek) wisdom too. Divinely inspired and learned in the Law, they came as close as was possible to being facsimiles of Moses the Law giver. Divine inspiration—as understood in the post-Malachi (Ezra Nehemiah) period—was theirs in the highest possible degree. For after the priestly group acquired supremacy in postexilic Judea, the status of anyone who claimed that he received revelation, and hence authority, directly from God—in other words, one who claimed to be imparting prophecy, like the old-fashioned prophets—was drasti cally diminished. Henceforth, it was the established and growing priestly bureaucracy, deriving its authority from the received Law of Moses, that comprehended and executed the will of God. Subsequently, the Judean community entered a new stage, in the Hellenistic period, when the theocratic state was replaced by a commonwealth and when the Torah have appeared exotic to Tyndale and his comrades. The questions that the King asked the translators at his banquet in their honor and their answers—taking up a major portion of the Letter (§§ 187-292)—are climaxed by "a burst of applause, with ejaculations and jubilations, for a considerable time," exactly the reaction of the audience at the beginning of the banquet (§186), when Eleazar, the eldest of the priests, offered the opening prayer. Of course, after the translation had been achieved and the translators had returned to Jerusalem, the King informed Eleazar "that if any of the men chose to return to him... he accounted it a privilege to associate with cultured men, and would rather lavish his wealth upon such men than upon vanities" (§321); the account of the translation ends on this note.</page><page sequence="12">[12] 100 HARRY M. ORLINSKY constitution was reinterpreted by the liberalizing Pharisees in accord ance with the new conditions. Henceforth it was the halakhah as the Pharisees comprehended it, it was the Torah of Moses as the Pharisees interpreted it and applied it in their attempts to introduce changes in Judea's social structure, that prevailed; nomocracy had set in. It is this phase of Judaism that is reflected in the Letter of Aristeas.14 And, again, only a Jewish reader would have understood the point that Aristeas was making; a Gentile reader would not understand that anything was "bothering" the author of the Letter. The role not only of the elders but also of the priests in the Revelation of the Torah at Sinai is duplicated by Aristeas in the making of the Septuagint; that is to say, just as the distinction between them and their precise roles at Sinai are unclear in the biblical accounts, just so are they in Aristeas' account of the translation. This fact seems to have escaped notice hitherto. In Ex. 19 we are told that when the Israelites were encamped in front of Mount Sinai, God told Moses to tell the people: 5 "Now, if you will obey Me... you shall be My treasured possession among all the peoples. Indeed, all the earth is Mine, 6 but you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation..." The account continues: 7 Moses came and summoned the elders of the people and put before them all the words that the Lord had commanded him. 8 All the people answered as one, "All that the Lord has spoken we will do!" And Moses brought back the people's words to the Lord. Note "priests" in v. 6, but "elders" in v. 7 (and "people" in v. 8); the matter of editorial compilation-redaction need not detain us here (cf., e.g., S. R. Driver, Int. to the Lit. of the O. T., 9th ed., p. 32). 14 This paragraph derives from p. 278 of my article on "The Canonization of the Bible," etc. (chap. 15 of my Essays, 257-286). See, e.g., S. Zeitlin, The Rise Rise and Fall of the Judaean State, Vol. I (5722-1962; Jewish Publication So ciety), Prolegomena (pp. 1-33), Part One: Judaism Meets Hellenism (37-131, passim),passim), and Part Three: Social and Religious Developments, etc. (175-313, passim);passim); E. Rivkin, The Shaping of Jewish History (1971; Scribner's), chap. Ill (pp. 42-83). Note, e.g., the major role that halakhah played in the decisions of the Pharisees to exclude such works as Susannah, Tobit, Jubilees, and Judith from the canon of Holy Writ (S. Zeitlin, "An Historical Study of the Canoniza tion of the Hebrew Scriptures" [in Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, 3[1931-32], § IV, pp. 141 ff.]).</page><page sequence="13">[13] SEPTUAGINT AS HOLY WRIT 101 In the Letter (§ 184), "Eleazar,14a the eldest of the priests who had come with us [from Jerusalem],'י is called upon to offer a prayer —on which, since priests had not been mentioned previously in connection with the elders-translators, Hadas has commented, "It is probable (the alleged distribution by tribes notwithstanding) that all or most of the translators would be priests." And in § 310 we are told that "When the rolls (of the translation) had been read the priests [Hadas: Of the Alexandrian (Jewish) community] and the elders [Hadas: in point of age] of the translators and some of the corporate body [Thackeray: the priests and the oldest of the translators and some members of the (Jewish) community] stood up and said..." It is clear that there were priests among the elders-translators, though why (Eleazar/Elisha) should be designated "priest" rather than "elder" is un certain; at the same time, I wonder whether it is really possible to exclude the "priests" in § 310 from being members of the elders-transla tors committee (as Eleazar/Elisha was), and whether the ttqeoPvteqoi ought not be understood simply as "elders" rather than "oldest" (the Greek phrase reads: 01 Ieqeïç xaî rœv sgfirjvewv 01 tiqsoPvtsqoi; note the term "leaders of the people" immediately following: xal x&amp;v àno tov noliTEVfiaxogjtohTEVfiaroç 01 re r/yov/ievoi rov nXrjdovç eï710v. If the "priests" here were members of the Alexandrian Jewish community, surely they would be mentioned in connection with the "leaders of the people" rather than before the elders-translators.15 14a Hadas follows Thackeray in substituting Elisha for Eleazar, with the note (p. 172, ad loc.) that it is "The reading of Josephus (97), who is not likely in error here. The slip is probably due to confusion..."; and at § 50 (p. 120), where Eleazar is the name given to the second of the six elders chosen from the tenth tribe as translators, Hadas notes that Josippon and Jerahmeel regarded this Eleazar as the chief of the translators. But this identification has little value, since these two medieval worthies knew the story of the translation ultimately from Josephus, not from the Letter itself. Note also Meecham (§ "The Use of AristeasAristeas by Josephus"), pp. 330 f., "Wendland ... and Abrahams ... point out that it is rarely permissible to emend the text of Aristeas by the aid of Josephus ... the name 'EfaaÇaoov (codd., 184) he converts into יEhaaaïov " Isserlin (see n. 16 below) does not deal with the Elisha-Eleazar. problem, it is outside the scope of his study. 15 Note the biblical Hebrew construction in ordvreç ...el710v (ויקומו . ..ויאמרו), on which Hadas commented, "ROSE UP contributes to the solemnity"; actually, while translated literally "they stood up/standing up... and/they said," the verb קום (as so frequently in biblical Hebrew; and similarly בוא "enter," הלו "go") is used here as an auxiliary verb ("they proceeded to say; thereupon they said"; or the like). The term קום does not imply that the priests and elders and some of the corporate body and leaders had been sitting or squatting, nor was it meant to introduce solemnity—the whole occasion and section are solemn enough.

ORLINSKY [14] It is no accident that it was the high priest himself who played the central role in deciding that the Septuagint translation should be made, who picked the seventy-two elders ("six ffom each tribe") who were to make the translation, and who sent the copy of the Hebrew Torah that was to be used for the translation (§§41-46). For it was the high priest, Aaron, who was associated with Moses in the Revelation at Sinai (Ex. 19.24; 24.1 ff.). This much has long been noted, if not always sufficiently appreciated. But what has been overlooked is that this specific connection of the high priest in Jerusalem with the high priest at Sinai—more than a millennium apart—was actually carried a step farther, rather a significant step, by the author of the Letter. I have reference to the name given by the author to the high priest in Jerusalem, Eleazar. Out of all the names that Aristeas had at his dis posl for the high priest in Jerusalem, why did he choose that of Eleazar? On our overall view—that Aristeas1 primary motive in composing the Letter in the first place was to promote the Greek translation in the Jewish community as divinely inspired—the choice of name was not fortuitous. Eleazar, third son of Aaron (Ex. 6.23; Num. 3.2), after serving as "head chieftain of the Levites... in charge of those attending the duties of the sanctuary" (Num. 3.23), succeeded Aaron as high priest (Num. 20.25-28; Deut. 10.6), and he occupied that exalted office not only under Moses but also under Joshua; in fact, he participated with Joshua and the tribal heads in allotting territory to the Israelites in Canaan (Josh. 14.1). In every way he could think of, even in choosing a name for his high priest, the author of the Letter made the Septuagint nomosnomos the equivalent of the Hebrew torah}6 And the fact is that he succeeded very well indeed. The Jewish com munity outside of Judea, wherever Greek was the vernacular, adopted 16 It will be recalled that Aaron's first two sons, Nadab and Abihu, were said to have been utterly rejected by God for good cause (Lev. 10.1 ff.), and that the line of Eleazar, which included Zadok, dominated thereafter, indeed, Moses himself, at the express command of God, invested Eleazar on Mount Hor with Aaron's own garments (Num. 20.25-28). In his recent study of "The Names of the 72 Translators of the Septuagint (Aristeas, 47-50)" on pp. 191-197 of The Gaster Festschift (Journal of the Ancient Ancient Near Eastern Society of Columbia University, 5 [1973]), B.S.J. Isserlin does not deal with the name Eleazar for the high priest; his interest lay in the Judean vs. Egyptian occurrences of the names. Hadas' Comment on the name "Eleazar" misses the point (§1): "The name Eleazar (like Simon) is traditional in this literature for a hero of the spirit..." I may note here that Isserlin's conclusion that the names in question tend to indicate a Judean rather than Alexandrian source does not prove that the Septuagint translation was actually made by a group of Judean Jews; this con elusion fits well my own position that the author of the Letter did everything he could to make it appear that Jews from Judea, the Holy Land, made the translation.</page><page sequence="15">[15] SEPTUAGINT AS HOLY WRIT 103 the Greek version as thoroughly authoritative. It became the Bible of Diaspora Jewry to such an extent that when Christianity began to develop within its midst and then grew in numbers and influence outside of and in opposition to it, it was natural for Christians to regard and use the Greek Bible as Judeans and other Jews regarded and used the Hebrew original.17 Had Christianity developed such that it continued to remain within the Jewish fold, the Septuagint would have continued as the Bible for those Jewries in the Diaspora (parallel to the Targum and the Hebrew original for others) for whom Greek was the mother tongue. B The Philosophy of the Septuagint (and Some Modern) Translators One would hardly dare claim divine inspiration for a translation of the Hebrew Torah that tended to be free or paraphrastic, that was inclined to render two words by one or to combine two sentences into one, that was disposed to leave out from the Hebrew—or add to it— a word or a phrase, that perverted the plain meaning of the Hebrew, and the like. One did not deal lightly with the text of God's Holy Law. So that—apart from whatever philosophies of translation prevailed in the Hellenistic world in general and in Alexandria in particular in the third-second centuries B.C.E.18—it is the literal, word-for-word rendering that prevailed in the Septuagint version of the Torah. The modern textual critic playing the role of a translator of a biblical Book will realize what it means to render a Hebrew sentence literally, word for word, and then discover that this collection of words, the consequence of extreme fidelity to the Hebrew text, more frequently than is generally realized, actually makes up a no-sense sentence. He 17 See the discussion by A. M. Dubarle, "Note Conjointe sur l'Inspiration de la Septante," pp. 572-579 (chap. 33) in Studies in the Septuagint, ed.

ORLINSKY [16] will also realize what it is to be confronted by a Hebrew word or phrase whose meaning is no longer ascertainable, or—what can be exasperatingly worse—which has two and even three possible meanings (not to men tion nuances), and he must decide on a single translation (without benefit of footnotes for alternate renderings or for explanations in self defense!); or what it means when the Hebrew text asserts something that he can hardly accept as true, or binding, or dignified, and he must decide whether to reproduce the unacceptable forthrightly—it is, literally, the word of God!—or paraphrase it, or mistranslate, or even suppress it by benign neglect. The textual critic of our own days too often fails to put himself in the shoes of the Septuagint translator of old, and so fails to understand his translation and the text, whence it derived. Lest this assertion remain abstract or vague, a specific example or two is in order. So far as a word-for-word translation is concerned, let us take a look, e.g., at Gen. 15.2. God appeared in a vision to Abram and told him that his reward for faithfulness would be very great. But Abram replied, "O"O Lord God, what can You give me, seeing that I continue childless," and he continues: ובדמשק ביתי הוא דמשק אליעזר. This second half of the verse—whether it be the original or a corrupted form of the original —has defied translators and commentators from the very beginning.19 The Septuagint rendered it: "and the son of Mes(h)ek of my household, he is Damascus Eliezer." I regard this rendering, precisely because it is literal, a word-for-word no-sense translation. The translator did not know what the author of his Hebrew Vorlage wanted to tell him, and he had no recourse in his translation to footnotes of any kind (alternate renderings, explanatory comments, etc.). The translation conveyed to the reader the idea that "Damascus Eliezer son of Meshek is a member of my household/' an assertion that has no meaning in the context; but the translator had reproduced faithfully the Hebrew words of his divinely-revealed and inspired Hebrew text. As for what the translation really meant, that was for the learned reader of the translation to deter mine—no less than it was for the reader of the original Hebrew text. In this respect, the Septuagint translator—bound by the word-for-word philosophy of translation and unable to resort to footnotes of any kind— is in my opinion very frequently more trustworthy than the majority of modern translators who have more often than is realized (even if un wittingly) misled their readers into believing that they know exactly what the Hebrew text means. Thus the Revised Standard Version (RSV) renders our passage in Genesis, "and the heir of my house is Eliezer 19 Cf., e.g., S. R. Driver, The Book of Genesis, 3rd ed. (1904; often reprinted)—the source of most subsequent commentaries on Genesis, even if without attribution.</page><page sequence="17">[17] SEPTUAGINT AS HOLY WRIT 105 of Damascus"; the New American Bible (NAB) reads, "... if... I... have as my heir the steward of my house, Eliezer"; the New English Bible (NEB) translates "for the heir to my household is Eliezer of Damascus." None of these official versions can be justified: it is simply impossible to render דמשק אליעזר by "Eliezer of Damascus,יי and there is no way of proving that משק or בן־משק means "heir or "steward" (indeed, the usual term for "heir," יורש, is employed in the very next verse). Or to put it differently: one has but to try to turn the renderings of RSV, NAB, and NEB back into biblical Hebrew, and he will see that what he ends up with is not at all our Hebrew text. Two other modern translations are more forthright: the Jerusalem Bible (JB) has simply reproduced our phrase by three dots, with the note, "the original text is irrecoverably corrupt..."; and the New Jewish Version (NJV) has rendered, "and the one in charge of my household is Damascus Eliezer," with the note: "Hebrew obscure" (i.e., the preserved text is unintelligible and the original is beyond recovery). So that the reader is warned in these two versions (a bit drastically, I believe, in JB)—as he is not in the above-cited three—that he should not depend on their renderings and draw no conclusions from or build any theories on them. For the NJV, I might now prefer "and the inheritor/heir of my household" to "and the one in charge (or: the steward) of my house hold"hold" for ובדמשק ביתי, on the ground that the author of v. 3, who wrote והנה בן־ביתי יורש אותי ("one of my household will be my heir"), understood בן־משק ביתי to mean that "a member of my household (בן־ביתי) will inherit me/be my heir" (יורש אותי) — just as he reproduced, correctly, מה־תתן־לי ("what can/will You give me") and ואנכי הולך ערירי ("since/("since/seeing that I continue childless") in v. 2 by הן לי לא נתתה זרע ("since You have granted me no offspring"). I would have a footnote to the effect that both the text and its meaning are uncertain, and that the rendering "heir5' for בן־משק derives from יורש in the parallel clause. So that if this rendering is in error, and it may well be, it is at least an ancient error; but the average reader is warned not to accept it as certain, and the scholar will not build any theories on it. As a second example let us take Gen. 1.1-3. In the Septuagint version —as in the Tyndale-Authorized (King James) Version, e.g., nearly two millennia later20—each word and phrase, even the word order, is re produced literally (e.g., [ev àgxfj] ènoîrjaev o Oeoç for בראשית] ברא אלהים] 20 See §§ A, Bl, and C (respectively "The Four Great Ages of Bible Translation," "The Philosophy of Bible Translation," and "The New Jewish Version [NJV]," pp. 4 S.

ORLINSKY in v. 1; the absence of the understood predicate in v. 2a / [וחשך] על־פני תהום]] [xaî axôroç] êjiâva) [rov vôaroç]), and each main division in the Hebrew (הארץ at the end of v. 1; תהום ,ובהו, and המים in v. 2; אור and אור in v. 3) is observed. But unlike Tyndale and his immediate successors, on what authority have we based our belief that the Septuagint translator comprehended the Hebrew text exactly as he reproduced it? To translate the Hebrew text word for word is one thing; but it is a gratuitous assumption that the translator understood the text literally. As a matter of fact, one has but to recall the amount and the numerous kinds of hermeneutics employed by the ancient interpreters of the Bible —that it was, in our view, frequently eisegesis rather than exegesis, is beside the point here—to realize that the plain meaning of the text was not easily permitted to stand in the way of anyone's interests.21 Such generalizations as "Every translation is a commentary" and "traduttore traditore"traditore"—whatever be their merit for serious scholarly use—have no meaning when the Hebrew text of the Torah is turned into "pony" Greek (or English) 22 The literal, word-for-word rendering of the Hebrew into Greek ought not be, and has generally not been, a reason for the modern scholar to jump to the conclusion—a conclusion, as James Thurber once put it in another connection, that may well be his own—that because the Septua gint translators reproduced literally the anthropomorphisms and anthro popathisms in their Hebrew text, they therefore meant to convey to their readers the idea that they believed that God, in the maimer of 21 Thus Rashi—no less than many modern commentators and translators— understood Gen. 1.1-3 to mean that "When God began to create the heaven and the earth... 3God said..with v. 2 constituting a circumstantial clause; and he insisted, correctly, that the text did not deal with the order of creation; see pp. 49 f. of my Notes on... the Torah (and the bibliographical reference on p. 268 to my linear translation into English of Rashi's commentary on the Torah). 22 There is hardly any need to present here additional instances of literal, no-sense renderings of the Hebrew into Greek, any more than there would be for, say, the King James version. Thus in dealing with the sharp contrast between the Jewish Version of 1917, patterned after the word-for word translations of the King James, Revised, and—ultimately—Septuagint versions on the one hand, and the New Jewish Version on the other, I had such frequent occasion to comment on this phenomenon that after a while I simply had to stop drawing attention to it. Even more, on numerous occasions I noted that precisely the word-for-word rendering misled the reader into be lieving that the Hebrew text said something which was not what the text was meant to convey—a meaning that an idiomatic rendering would have brought out clearly; see Orlinsky, ed. Notes on... the Torah, pp. 10 If., 19 if., 49 If. (Gen. 1.1-3), 57 f. (1.14), 62 (2.21), 64 (3.8), 65 f.

Indeed, the Jewish statements of the intertestamental period on this precise subject are unanimous in their rejection of this—to them, blatant—non sequitur; in point of fact, it would hardly have occurred to any Jew to think of God anthro pomorphically, let alone to defend that view, had it not been for some malicious pagan intellectuals who stated that the God of the Jews possessed human attributes and who jeered at the Jews for worshiping that kind of deity.23 (I wonder whether it would be fair to ask—in view of the differences in time and place and outlook—whether modern scholars have attributed to translators from Tyndale-Luther on, the belief that God had human attributes simply because the vast majority of these attributes are reproduced literally ["in the eyes of God," etc.]; neither have these translators worried that their readers might get that notion from their literal translations.) It is now amply clear from a number of studies dealing with the Pentateuch, Joshua, Isaiah (1-35, 40-66; but contrast 36-39!), Jeremiah, the Minor Prophets, Psalms, and Job,24 that the various Septuagint translators did not avoid these "isms"; and if on occasion—rare as that occasion may be—an "ism" was not reproduced literally, it was not for any theological reason.25 23 I have in mind, e.g., the accusation levelled against the Jews that they worshiped the ass and the refutation of the charge by Josephus and Philo, among others; see, e.g., "Ass-worship" in Jewish Encyclopedia, II, 222-224 (by S.

References to the works of others on the subject will be found in several of the publications here listed. 25 Isa. 36-39 constitutes a notable exception. Hurwitz (see preceding note) has concluded that the translator of these four chapters was not the translator of the two major parts of the Book that preceded and followed. It is my belief that these four chapters (=11 Kings 18-20) were not present in the Hebrew Vorlage of the original translator of the book of Isaiah.</page><page sequence="20">108 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [20] The fact that the Septuagint was made by Jews for Jews should have warned scholars not to read into the translation problems that clearly did not occur to the translators themselves or to their Jewish readers; any problems the non-Jewish readers might have had with these "isms5' would not have concerned the Jewish community. And the fact that a Philo or a Josephus, as Christianity subsequently, had to "defend" and "explain" these "isms" in the post-Septuagint period is hardly pertinent to the Alexandrian Jewish community of the preceding third-first centuries B.C.E. The foregoing naturally leads to an overall evaluation of the Septu agint that may be surprising at first. Once it is recognized that this version was made expressly for Jews and that its philosophy of trans lation was basically that of verbal equivalency (including whenever possible the Hebrew word order), the modern textual critic, translator, or commentator ought to approach the Septuagint with the utmost respect, indeed with far greater respect and caution than in dealing with the received (so-called masoretic) Hebrew text. For the latter came into being piecemeal and over a long period of many centuries, and experienced many changes at different hands under varied cir cumstancescumstances and influences; moreover—unlike the specific biblical Books themselves, whatever the order of those Books in the second and third divisions of the Hebrew Bible, the Prophets and the Writings—the Hebrew text itself was never actually fixed.26 In contrast, the Septuagint translation of each Book was made, for the most part, from a single, complete Hebrew Book, and it did not experience the process of redaction, in its various forms, by several hands over an extended period. It had but a single source—the Hebrew text before the translator; and it had essentially but a single milieu (allowing for Judean influence)—Hellenistic Alexandria. Our preserved Hebrew text, on the other hand, had a number of sources deriving from several milieus, many of them—if not most of them—beyond recovery. Finally, it must be kept in mind that when a redactor dealt with the Hebrew documents at his disposal, they had, at best, not yet received such canonical status as only widespread knowledge and use of them could provide; they were, in short, dealing with documents that were not as yet Holy Writ. The Septuagint translators, on the other hand, were dealing with Holy Writ. Consequently, scholars should never have treated the text of the Septuagint as cavalierly as the received Hebrew text, that is, they should not have dismissed the Septuagint— apart from the usual scribal corruptions, conflations, adaptations, and 26 See my Prolegomenon, "The Masoretic Text: a Critical Evaluation," pp. XVm-XXXVI in the KTAV reissue of C.

Ginsburg, Introduction to the Masoretico-Critical Edition of the Hebrew Bible (1966).</page><page sequence="21">[21] SEPTUAGINT AS HOLY WRIT 109 the like, that such documents contain—as an unreliable witness to the Hebrew text of the biblical Book from which it derived. It remained for the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in midcentury to force scholars to turn back to the Septuagint as a reliable witness to the Hebrew text whence it derived. When parts of and then all of the text of the Scroll of Isaiah became available to scholarly scrutiny, there was a rush to get on the Scrolls "bandwagon"; scholars, many of whom had not previously dabbled in the textual criticism of the Bible, became instant experts in the field, and rather sweepingly pro claimed as original readings in the Scroll text that differed from their correspondents in the received text, especially when these readings coincided—more accurately, in most cases, appeared to coincide— with the Septuagint. Now that the Isaiah Scroll has long been out of the limelight, it is possible to look more objectively at the numerous publications on the textual criticism of Isaiah that involved the Scroll and the Septuagint; it does not seem unfair to assert that there was much less than met the eye so far as a basis for emending the received Hebrew text was concerned, and that nothing was discovered that weakened the reliability of the Septuagint as a witness to its Vorlage. Put differently, scholars made too much of the text of the Scroll at the outset because they did not take the time and effort to make the kind of study that would have shown them that the text of the Scroll coincided substantially with our received text, and that neither coincided wholly with that of the Septuagint Vorlage. The matter of the Hebrew Vorlage of the Septuagint has become especially acute since the appearance of the fragments from Jeremiah and Samuel among the Dead Sea Scrolls. Already the ancients were confronted by the fact that the Septuagint text of the books of Jeremiah and Job were respectively about one-eighth and one-sixth shorter than the Hebrew texts in their possession (apart from the chapter-and-verse order in Jeremiah). For them—e.g., for such scholars as Origen and St. Jerome—the problem and solution were simple enough: the Hebrew text was the "Truth" and the Septuagint text had to be accommodated to it, whether by way of making good the minuses in the Septuagint and noting the pluses—as Origen did—or by choosing the Hebrew text in preference to the Septuagint in making a translation of God's Sacred Scriptures, the Hebrew Scriptures—as St. Jerome did. The modern scholar, however, who—quite properly—looks upon the Hebrew text of the Bible as he would upon any ancient primary source, has, in turn, too often failed to take due critical cognizance of this ancient attitude to the Hebrew text of the Bible and its implications. What I have in mind is this: a pious Jew, knowledgeable enough in Hebrew and Greek, decides to translate the book of Joshua or Jeremiah</page><page sequence="22">110 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [22] or Job from Hebrew into Greek. It is, for him and for his contemporary readers, a sacred text; that text speaks to him and to his Jewish com munity directly and authoritatively. It is the word—or Word—of God. It seems to me inconceivable that with this attitude and motivation, the Septuagint translator would proceed to delete, whenever he was so moved, words and phrases—as in the book of Joshua—and even entire sentences and sections—as in Jeremiah and. Job—and alter extensively the order of the chapters and verses of his sacred Hebrew text—as in the book of Jeremiah. I would put it more bluntly; the modern scholar had no right to assume a priori that the Septuagint translator manipulated his Hebrew text; in point of fact, it is the opposite assump tion that would be valid, viz., that unless and until a case is made for regarding the Septuagint translation of any Book as an unreliable witness to the Hebrew text, the translator must be regarded as a serious, forth right reproducer of that text. The "minuses" in the Septuagint of Joshua—"minus" only vis-à-vis the received Hebrew text—are a very good case in point. The expression ,משה עבד יהוד occurs 17 times in the Book, but the phrase ,עבד יהוד is lacking 4 times in the Septuagint (1.1, 15; 12.66; 22.4); the word ארון, alone or with ברית and/or ,יהוד, occurring 29 times in the received Hebrew text, is absent 6 times in the Greek (4.5; 6.4, 6 [My], 7; 7.6); the phrase עבר הירדן is lacking in the Greek once (1.14; all three words משה בעבר הירדן are absent) out of the 13 times that it is present in our Hebrew text. In all these instances—as well as in those that involve such other terms as תודה ,גדול ,הזה/זה, and מצרים — Margolis, in his monumental attempt to achieve "the nearest approach to the Greek original as it left the hands of the translator(s)" (The Book of Joshua in in Greek, 1931 ff.), was content with the explanatory comment: "G omits." But this was only an assertion that had never been demonstrated, one that—even if it came from so erudite a scholar as Margolis—failed to do any justice to the Septuagint translator of his Sacred Hebrew text in the first place, and which failed to derive from an objective study of the character of the Septuagint translation of Joshua in the second place; in fine, Margolis5 characterization of the Septuagint of Joshua was justified neither a priori nor a posteriori. It was in line with the equally gratuitous statement made three decades previously by George Adam Smith in Hastings5 Dictionary of the Bible (s. "Joshua,55 vol. II [1900], p. 784), quoted approvingly by Swete (Introduction to the Greek Greek Old Testament, p. 244 top), that Joshua was "not regarded by the (LXX) translators as sharing the peculiar sanctity of the Torah." Whether the Hebrew text of the book of Joshua did or did not have the same sanctity in the eyes of the Septuagint translator as the Torah</page><page sequence="23">[23] SEPTUAGINT AS HOLY WRIT 111 did, I do not know; but there is no way of proving that it did not from the Greek text of the Book. He was no whit less faithful to his Hebrew VorlageVorlage than the translators of the Torah were to their Hebrew Vorlage. For it is now possible, nay imperative, not only from an internal study of the Greek text of Joshua in relation to the Hebrew but from the pertinent analogy of Books such as Samuel, Jeremiah, and Job, to assert that the Greek text of Joshua derived from a Hebrew text that differed from that of our preserved (so-called masoretic) Hebrew text both in the matter of minuses and of pluses.27 In the case of the Torah, on which see Swete briefly (Introduction, p. 243), the absence of a correspondent in the received text at Gen. 4.8 for Septuagint SiéAOœfiev e'iç to nediov does not indicate an adden dum in the Greek but an internal corruption in the Hebrew: לכה מצאה השדה accidentally fell out of the Hebrew text from which the Septuagint Vorlage Vorlage derived.28 There is little merit in Swete,s sweeping assertion (p. 234) on Gen. 31.46 ff., where (following S. R. Driver) he recognizes "some confusion... (and) M is loosely put together," that "In G the materials seem to have been re-arranged with the view of giving greater consistency to the narratives." It is hardly the translator who rearranged the text; he simply reproduced the text he had before him. An equally gratuitous assumption is that in Gen. 35.16 ff. "The transposition in G appears to be due to a desire to locate Eder... between Bethel and Bethlehem..Was there really that much at stake for the translator that he had to shift v. 21 to v. 16 and alter the text in the process (e.g., deleting initial "And they journeyed" in v. 16, among other changes)? It is far more likely that an accidental corruption involving "Bethel" in w. 15 and 16 and initial "And they/he journeyed" in w. 16 and 21 is involved here, whether in our received text or in the Septuagint Vorlage Vorlage (less likely in an early edition of the Septuagint). On the relative order of the two Commandments involving murder and adultery (Swete, p. 234), see my discussion of the Alexandrian vis-à-vis Judean views of the Bible (Prolegomenon, "The Masoretic Text," etc., pp. XIX ff. and the Notes, especially n. 12, on pp. XL f.).

Fortunately, Swete accepted here the arguments of such scholars as Wellhausen and Driver—though he should have made specific mention of Popper. No one would argue seriously that the reading indicated by the Septuagint at Deut. 31.1, ויכל משה לדבר (cf. 32.45) is the original of the corrupt וילך משה וידבר in our received text (cf. my Notes on... the Torah,Torah, p. 256). But that is not the main point. What is important is that scholars have not yet sufficiently recognized that the translator did not edit or emend a text that contained our preserved reading, for he was not an editor-harmonizer; he was a translator, and he translated what his Hebrew text offered him. A pity indeed that so many modern scholars have created anthropomorphic-theological-contextual-textual problems for the Septuagint translators that they never had, and have then proceeded to create "solutions" of the same ephemeral substance —usually at the "expense5' of the integrity and scholarship of the translators. As with the book of Joshua, so with Job, scholars should never have permitted themselves to go astray by mechanically "blaming" the Septuagint whenever it differed meaningfully from our received Hebrew text; if this was not clear widely enough when the methodology of the textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible was being developed in the nine teenth century, it certainly should have been when archaeology entered the picture after World War I in the twentieth.30 For in Job too it is simply incredible that with the overall philosophy of translation prac ticed by the Septuagint translators and from the internal evidence readily available in the Greek and Hebrew texts of Job to anyone who cared to to study them directly and objectively, anyone could seriously charge the translator with deleting words and phrases and sections; a translator 29 Der biblische Bericht iiber die Stiftshiitte (Leipzig, 1862); cf.

Finn, "The Tabernacle Chap ters," JThS, 16 [1915], 449-482) by D. W. Gooding, The Account of the Taber naclenacle (Cambridge, 1959). 30 I have discussed this in "Whither Biblical Research?", JBL, 90 (1971), 1-14 (reprinted as Chap. 11 in my Essays, 200-217). Interestingly, it was August Dillmann, more than any other individual scholar, who was responsible for the negative attitude to the Septuagint in both Joshua and Job (see my "The Hebrew Vorlage,"Vorlage," etc. [cited in n. 27 above], and Chap. I of my "Studies in the Septuagint of... Job," HUCA, 28 (1957), 53 ff.</page><page sequence="25">[25] SEPTUAGINT AS HOLY WRIT 113 who reproduced anthropomorphisms, anthropopathisms, charges against God, absence of belief in afterlife, and the like, and who made every effort to understand and translate difficult words and phrases instead of passing over them in silence, should have been treated with greater respect than that—unless and until the charges had been proved. The situation in Jeremiah is largely the same as in Job, except for the important fact that chapters and verses do not always follow the same order (see conveniently Swete, pp. 233 and 241 f.) and "only" one eighth in quantity of the Hebrew text—as against one-sixth in Job— is lacking in the Septuagint. I had occasion recently to work closely with a doctoral candidate on his dissertation on the Septuagint of the book of Jeremiah (see the reference in n. 24 above), and it became more than amply clear in the course of the investigation that the Septuagint translator did not curtail or manipulate the order of a text that coin cided with our received text; rather, he had a sharply different Hebrew text before him, one that he reproduced faithfully. The problem, then, is not one of Greek vs. Hebrew, but that of the Septuagint Vorlage vs. the textus receptus. The fact that a Dead Sea Scroll fragment of Jeremiah has come to light in which the verse order coincides with that of the Septuagint as against that of the received text (10.5a, 9, 5b, 11, with w. 6-8 and 10 lacking—as against 10.5-10 in the received text), merely reinforces that conclusion;31 for even if the text of the Jeremiah fragment coincided with that of the received Hebrew—as essentially in the case of Isaiah—even that would not invalidate that con elusion. Still, it is good to have the Scroll fragment for support, apart from its significance for other aspects of research in the Uberlieferungs geschichtegeschichte of the biblical text. Finally, it is now clear that the most important of the Dead Sea Scrolls for the textual criticism of the Bible are the fragments of I—II Samuel (4QSam* and 4QSamb). In working up recently the draft version of the Book for the committee responsible for the New Jewish (Publi cation Society) Version of the Bible, I had the considerable benefit of a copy of these fragments, graciously made available to me by Frank M. Cross Jr.; unable to make public use of this material until after it has appeared publicly, my comments here will necessarily be brief. Let it be stated at once that from the passages of Samuel which the fragments have preserved, it is amply clear that the numerous and meaningful differences in the Septuagint as against the received text are due to the different Hebrew Vorlage of the translator, and that that Vorlage coincides time and time again with the text in the Samuel 31 See F. M. Cross, Jr., The Ancient Library of Qumran, etc., rev. ed. (Anchor Book, 1961), p. 187 and n. 38 (= pp. 139 f. and n. 38 in the first [1958] ed.).</page><page sequence="26">114 HARRY M. ORLINSKY 126] fragments.32 (See, e.g., the "Textual Notes" on Samuel in the New American American Bible, pp. 342-351 in ed. St. Anthony Guild, 1970.) One who has studied closely (1) the raison d'être of the Septuagint in its Alexandrian Jewish setting and (2) the meticulous analyses of the text of Samuel by Wellhausen (1871) and Driver (1889; rev. ed. 1913), will not be surprised by this, though he will be gratified to have the Scroll fragments as auxiliary evidence. Scholars have every reason to look forward impatiently and hopefully to the publication of the Samuel fragments. 32 Cross is less than generous and fair when he fails to mention S. R. Driver in this connection and evaluates Wellhausen somewhat less than positively (p. 181, n. 27) : "Among the studies of the text of Samuel, for example, that which needs least revision in light of the new evidence is Wellhausen's Der Text derder Biicher Samuelis published in 1871" (though note the phrase "the master, Julius Wellhausen" on p. 176). Neither Wellhausen (a century ago!) nor Driver (a few decades later) needed the Dead Sea Scrolls to recognize the existence and value of the Septuagint Vorlage; and their methodology in the textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible needs but the kind of revision that marks the work achieved only by scholars of excellence, and of courage.</page></plain_text>
