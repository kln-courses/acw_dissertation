BURTON University of Chicago It would be highly desirable, if it were also practicable, to show the development of the meaning of the three Hebrew words named above chronologically and genetically, and to this end to exhibit in succession the usage of the several great periods of Old Testament literature. But aside from the fact that such an exhibit would demand more space than can be given to it here, the problem itself is complicated by several facts which place a solution of it worthy of the attention of scholars beyond the powers of the present writer. For example, in the oldest extant literature it is evident that we have not the beginnings of Hebrew usage, but a stage of development in which it is already difficult to distinguish primitive from derived meanings, and in the later stages there are many questions of relative antiquity of different portions of the Old Testament, and of the interpretation of obscure passages which still further obscure the solution. On the other hand, the broad facts respecting relationship of meanings seem to be fairly clear, and wholly to ignore genetic relationships is to risk a result- ing degree of misrepresentation of relations of meanings which might affect unfavorably our judgment even respecting the New Testament usage. The following analyses, accordingly, are an endeavor to represent the usage of the Old Testament as a whole, rather than by successive periods, but with the various meanings so arranged as to avoid any serious misrepresentation of genetic relations. I. t-' I. Wind.-This was apparently the earliest meaning of t~T. It occurs in all periods of the literature. I.

I8:II, 43; 83:14; Io3:I6; 104:3, 4; 147:18; Isa. 7:2; i7:I3; 27:8; 32:2; 41:I6; 57:13; 64:5; Jer. 2:24; 1o:13; 13:24; 18:I7; 51:16; Ezek. 5:2, io; Dan. 2:35; Hos. 4:19; Zech. 5:9; 6:5; Jon. I:4; 4:8. It is sometimes spoken of as proceeding from God, yet not in such way as to change the meaning of the word. Hos. 13:15: b '159'0 oiltTM ' P "T. :' An east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord coming up from the wilder- ness. See other examples in Gen. 8:I; Exod. Io:13, 19; 14:21; I5:io (?); Num. 11:31; Ps. 107:25; 135:7; Isa. 4o:7; Am. 4:I3. Sometimes the writer has in mind the destructive force of the wind, but this also involves no change of meaning. I Kings i9: ii: P" 1 P 13 nM- 1bM 1bTMt o1l rr. . T And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord. See other examples in Ps. I1:6; 55:9; 148:8; Isa. II:I5; Jer. 4:1, 12; 22:22; 51:1; Ezek. 1:4; 7:I0o; 27:26. Because of its illusiveness, M-'1, meaning "wind," perhaps sometimes breath, is the symbol of nothingness, emptiness, vanity. Isa. 41:29: *01" -1=r * b.t Ct - ."*IIxlbt. n.jw Behold all of them, their works are vanity and nought: their molten images are wind and confusion. See also Job 7:7; 15:2; 16:3; 30:15 (perhaps, however, to be taken literally); Ps. 78:39; Prov. 1:29; Isa. 26:18; Jer. 5:13; Hos. 12:2. 2. By metonymy it is used for the points of the compass, or, in general, for direction in space. Jer. 52"23: " 6'1*q *'i' P' e'%' "'' And there were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides. See also I Chron. 9:24; Jer. 49:32, 36; Ezek. 5:10o, 12; 17:21; 42:16, 20; Dan. 8:8; 11:4. II. Spirit.--One might naturally conjecture that 1I-1 denoting spirit was a later development from its use to denote the breath,</page><page sequence="3">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 6I and that its application to the spirit of God was an outgrowth of its use with reference to the spirit of man. Unless, however, the order of development of meanings was widely different from the order of appearance in extant literature, or the judgment of modern scholars as to the order of the literature is wide of the mark, the meaning "spirit" came before "breath," and the applica- tion to God earlier than to man. i. Spirit of God. From the conception of the wind as con- trolled by, or proceeding from, God and operative in nature, apparently arose the conception of the spirit of God, signifying the unseen but powerful influence or influences by which God affected or controlled men. The change of English translation from "wind" to "spirit" doubtless somewhat exaggerates the change of meaning in the mind of Hebrew writer or speaker. It was still for them the O~''y p -n, only operative in a different sphere. a) The spirit of God is spoken of as operating in ways more or less analogous to those in which the wind might operate; yet in almost all the instances it is man who is affected thereby. II Kings 2:16: "T... T -%i MITIW.  -'_ r". 7 Vs o-- - -- --6 Lest peradventure the spirit of the Lord hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. For other examples see Gen. i:2; I Kings 18:12; Ezek. 2:2; 3:12, 14, 24; 8:3; ii:i, 24; 43:5 [cf. below under b)]. In Isa. 31:3 71- is used qualitatively with special reference to its powerfulness in contrast with the flesh as weak: The Egyptians are men and not God, and their horses flesh and not spirit. While the term does not refer specifically to the spirit of God, the idea of power associated with it is probably derived from the use of Mr-1 in reference to the divine spirit. Cf. II Kings 2: I6; Judg. 14:6. This generic or qualitative use of Mt' to express the idea of power is quite isolated and at the opposite pole of develop- ment from T as the symbol of weakness or emptiness derived from the more primitive use of rT. meaning wind. In Job 26:13 also r-1 is apparently used by metonymy for power.</page><page sequence="4">62 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY b) The spirit of God (t3'15 or 'Mltr) is spoken of as operat- ing upon or within men, producing various psychical and physico- psychical effects, such as physical strength, courage, prophetic frenzy, a prophetic message. The range of usage is very wide, from those in which the effect is purely physical to those in which the spirit is represented as giving to the prophet his message. Judg. 3:10:t"nt . 14n. I And the spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel. The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound. Other examples of M_. used in similar way are found in Gen. 41:38; Exod. 31:3; 35:31; Num. 11:17, 25, 29; 24:2; 27:18(?); Judg. 6:34; 11:29; 13:25; 14:6; 14:19; 15:14; I Sam. io:6, io; 11:6; 16:14a; I9:20, 23; II Sam. 23:2; I Chron. 12:19; II Chron. 15:1; 20:14; 24:20; Job 32:8 (by implication the spirit of Jeho- vah); Ps. 106:33; Ezek. I:12, 20, 21; II:5a; 37:1 [cf. the examples from Ezek. under a), as illustrating the close relationship of the two usages]; Hos. 9:7; Mic. 2:7; 3:8. Volz' interprets the expression "evil spirit from [or of] God," in I Sam. 16:14b; 16:15, 16, 23a, b; 18:io; 19:9; and Judg. 9:23, "God sent a 'pirit of evil between Abimelech and the men of Shechem," as referring to a demon, which originally had nothing to do with Yahweh, the phrases "from God," "of God," etc., being the product of a subsequent desire to make every extraordinary phenomenon subordinate to God. The expression as it stands would not in that case exactly reflect the thought of any period, but would be the result of the blending of ideas due to different periods and not wholly assimilated. For the purposes of the present paper it is not essential to determine the accuracy of this judgment. 1 Volz, Der Geist Gottes, Ttibingen, 19o10, pp. 4 ff.</page><page sequence="5">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 63 It is probable in any case that the idea of a demonic spirit arose in the Hebrew mind within the Old Testament period (see 3 below) and that within that period the conception of the supremacy of God prevailed to such an extent that Hebrew writers did not shrink from designating the source from which evil came as a spirit of God. Whether in the latter case those who framed or those who read such passages as Judg. 9:23; I Sam. 16:I4-23 had in mind the spirit of God, and understood the epithet "evil" as describing simply the result of the divine action, or conceived that the evil spirits (demonic) were God's in the sense that they were ultimately under divine control, is not wholly clear. The decision of the question depends mainly upon the date at which the idea of the demonic spirit became current in Israel. The question also arises, though on different grounds, whether in Exod. 28:3; Deut. 34:9 the expression "spirit of wisdom" refers to the spirit of God, called a spirit of wisdom because of the effect produced, or to the spirit of man, to which God imparts wisdom, or is simply a pleonastic phrase for wisdom. See also Isa. 28:6, "spirit of judgment." These passages are in them- selves capable of either interpretation. But such passages as Gen. 41:38 (cf. vs. 39); Mic. 3:8, in which similar results are ascribed to the spirit of God, expressly so called, favor the first interpretation. This probably applies also to Num. 27:18 and Zech. 12-.io. In II Kings 2:9, 15 the conception may be that the very spirit of Elijah was to come upon Elisha, but vs. I6 again suggests a reference to the spirit of God. So in Num. II:I7, 25, 26, the spirit (with the article) that is upon Moses, though not defined as the spirit either of Moses or of God, is put upon the young men by God, and is most probably thought of as the spirit of God. But both here and in II Kings 2:9, the conception is quantitative rather than purely individual; and all the other passages are perhaps somewhat influenced in thought and expres- sion by the fact of the quantitative idea of the spirit. c) Under the influence of an increasingly ethical conception of God, the spirit of God, called also the spirit of holiness, is spoken of as operative in the life of the community of the chosen people and of individuals, guiding, instructing, redeeming, ethically purifying.</page><page sequence="6">64 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY Isa. 44:3: :4 =b1 P I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring. Ps. 51:II (I3): ,,. = -?V t l'I J: .. . - Cast me not away from thy presence; And take not thy holy spirit from me. For other examples see Neh. 9:20, 30; 39:29; Isa. 11:2; 42:I; 48:16; 59:21; 63:10, II, I4; Ps. 139:7; 143:10; Hag. 2:5; Zech. 4:6; 2:10o; Joel 3:I2 (2:28, 29). The line of demarkation between this class and that which immediately precedes manifestly cannot be sharply drawn, many cases being on the border line. d) Rarely, and probably in part under the influence of the con- ception of _ri. as the breath of life, the spirit of God is spoken of as the source of physical life. Here, also, as under b) the spirit is sometimes, at least, thought of quantitatively. Cf. II, 2, d). Job 33:4: : '"V "'- = :~ 1 ? 0 e15-- 1r-. " - "*10: _j"T - The spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life. See also Gen. 6:3; Job 27:3; 34:14; Ps. 104:30o. As against the view of Wendt, Fleisch und Geist, pp. 19-22, that the wind, which forms the basis for the idea of the Spirit, is conceived of by the Hebrews as immaterial, Gunkel, Wirkungen des Heiligen Geistes, pp. 48 f., holds that the Hebrews thought of both wind and spirit as material, but as an extremely refined air- like substance. The possibility that spirit was a substance, but immaterial, is ignored by both of them; probably with reason in view of the lack of evidence that the Hebrews ever thought of immaterial substance. As between Wendt and Gunkel, the latter seems correct. Beyond this and the fact that the Hebrews denied to spirit the ordinary attributes of matter, it is difficult to go with certainty. 2. The spirit of man. a) As the seat of, or as identical with (the latter apparently the earlier of the two ideas) strength, courage, anger, distress, or the like [cf. examples under I, b) above].</page><page sequence="7">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 65 Judg. 8:3: 1 41 .1i'. 'l il- ) 1 71-0 .

Wellhausen and Nowack suggest the possibility that t3.')' means "on peril of your lives" (BDB, s.v.); this is possible for the preposition but a difficult if not impossible meaning for the noun. Smith (Int. Crit. Com.) takes Mr1 in the sense, character, purpose, or will, which is, however, neither strictly suitable to the context, nor a well-authenticated usage of the word, the passages cited scarcely vouching for it. The more general meaning "spirit," as the seat of emotion and will, is less open to objection. The sentence in that case would mean, "Guard yourselves in [the sphere of] your spirits, i.e., against those feelings which might lead one of you to deal treacherously with the wife of his youth." d) With approximation to the sense of ~., 1711 denotes the spirit of man as the seat or cause of life, often with accompanying reference to God as its source.

Thus saith the Lord, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundations of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him. See also Num. 27:16; Job 10:12; 12:10; 17:1; Ps. 31:5; Isa. 42:5; Ezek. io:17 (?). The passages in Eccl. (3:19, 21; I2:7), which must doubtless be taken all together, are peculiar in that the term MI1T is applied to the lower animals along with man, while at the same time God is represented as its source. The conception seems to be that there proceeds from God 1r10', quantitatively not individually thought of, which is the source and cause of life for both man and beast, and that at death this Mt-. returns from both man and beast to the source from which it came. Cf. II, I, d), above, and III, i, below. There is possibly to be discerned here an influence of the idea expressed by Epicharmus: ovveKpLW r Kal &amp;5eKpL0?

The idea of a demon, a personal spirit neither human nor divine, which was undoubtedly current in the ancient world,</page><page sequence="9">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 67 and is unquestionably found in late Jewish writings, is nowhere in the Old Testament expressed with that clearness which it acquires later. It is probable, however, that it is present in such passages as II Kings, chap. ig; Zech. i3:2; Job 4:15- Job 4 IS: C,.`Mtm? "I i':- M. '1T A spirit passed before my face and the hair of my flesh stood up. It is perhaps also to be found in I Kings 22:21-23 and the parallel passage, II Chron. 18: 20-22, in which Zedekiah describes the spirit by which Zedekiah and others have spoken as a lying spirit sent forth from God. But in view of the highly dramatic character of the passage it may be doubted whether the lan- guage is not simply a dramatic way of saying that Zedekiah is lying. The answer depends in this case, as in those mentioned under 2, a), mainly on the period at which the idea of the demon can be shown to have been current in Israel. The same con- siderations apply to Num. 5:14, 30, with its reference to a spirit of jealousy; to Hos. 4:12; 5:4, spirit of whoredom; Mic. 2: 11, spirit of falsehood; Isa. 19:14, spirit of perverseness; Isa. 29:10o, spirit of deep sleep. III. Breath, which is the sign of life, and the cessation of which is death.- i. Proprie.--The breath. Instances of this meaning are found first in the exilic period, and Ezek. 37:5-14 suggests a close connection between the older meanings, "wind" and "spirit," and the apparently later meaning, "breath."

See also Gen. 6:17; 7:15, 22; Job 9:18; I5:30; 19:17; Ps. 104:29; 135:17; 146:4; Jer. 10o:4; 14:6(?); 51:17; Lam. 4:20; Hab. 2:19.</page><page sequence="10">68 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY In all of these instances, except those in Job, the breath is definitely thought of as the breath of life.

As the symbol of anger or of power; of man (Isa. 25:4; 33:I1 [?]); of the Messiah (Isa. 11:4); but usually of God (Exod. 15:8; II Sam. 22:16; Job 4:9; Ps. 18:15; 33:6; Isa. 30:28; 59:19; Ps. 33:6; Job 4:9); sometimes apparently with a blending of the idea of wind.

Whether by .t. M1 and '1 1Ml. in Isa. 4:4 the prophet means the breath of God as the expression of his anger, or the spirit of God with an idea similar to that expressed by .. fi*' in Ps. 51: II, is not easy to decide. In any case the expression might easily be taken in the latter sense in later times. II. : The order of development of meanings is difficult to determine. The idea commonly held formerly that the fundamental idea is breath is now generally given up, there being no certain or prob- able instance of the use of the word in that sense. (On Job 4x1:2x [I3], Prov. 27:9, Isa. 13:20, see BDB,' s.v. ad fin.) The following analysis, though based on repeated personal study of all the Old Testament passages, is largely influenced by BDB, especially in respect to I, and the order of arrangement. I.

The occurrence of this usage compared with the use of M . .. to denote a living creature suggests the possibility that TE- alone properly means a creature (it could hardly be person) whether alive or dead. But the whole body of facts (note, e.g., the rarity of its use of the dead, and the limited number of instances of M~r compared with the large number of cases in which t.= alone expresses the idea of life) seems best accounted for by the supposition that .M when it occurs is pleonastic and that the use of jlE in reference to a dead body is an offshoot from its use to signify person [IV, 2, a)]. Cf. the use of the English word "person" (the Latin persona origi- nally meaning a mask covering the body) to denote the body as in the phrase "exposure of the person"; or the use of the word "soul" to mean a person, as in the expression "a thousand souls perished." III. Whatever the primitive Semitic sense of this term (see Gesenius- Buhl, which on the basis of the Arabic regards "skin" as the original meaning and assigns this to Ps. 1o2:6), the meaning which, with the possible exception of Ps. 1o2:6, is basal to all others in the Old Testament is clearly "flesh." Usage is as follows: I.

SUMMARY AND COMPARISON Respecting the three terms in the Old Testament, it is to be noted that MI-T, beginning undoubtedly as a term of physical or dynamic meaning, denoting wind, was already early in the literary period a religious term in the sense that it was used in connection with the idea of God to denote the invisible power by which he operated in the world, or for God himself as operative, but not for a hypostasis distinct from God. Relatively late it became a religious term in the sense also that it signified the power of God working to produce ethical and religious effects in men. As applied to men, probably under the influence of the thought that it was the spirit of the god that produced extraordinary effects in men, such as strength, courage, anger, ecstatic frenzy, etc., it denoted the seat of all such emotions and experiences, and then advanced to denote the seat of the ethical and religious in general. Its use with refer- ence to the breath is probably relatively late and subsequent in general to the previously named uses. 1 .., on the other hand, was from the earliest period of the literature preserved in the Old Testament a psychological and vital term, denoting the soul, or life, as that in a living, corporeal being which constitutes him living as distinguished from the inani- mate, and then the being himself as living. Its use with reference to God is very rare and probably a conscious anthropomorphism. As used to denote a corporeal living being, the #.4 is, of course, hypostatized; and this is also the case in respect to some of the instances in which it denotes the soul, since this is supposed to</page><page sequence="20">78 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY depart from the body and exist apart from it. The latter usage may also be very early and certainly persists very late. But in the majority of cases, the t. (meaning life or soul) is not a hypostasis, but a quality or characteristic of a living being. As the seat of appetite, emotion, mentality, and moral and religious experience, the usage of .. is closely parallel to that of MI'T. But while .). is often used for life, 7-1 is only rarely so used and then chiefly with reference to God as the source of life. lt= is fundamentally and prevailingly a physical term. Its only departure from this physical sense is in its employment by metonymy for kindred and for a corporeal living being. At the latter point, it becomes a synonym of S)., the one extending its psychical sense to include the physical and the other its physical to include the psychical. It never acquires a mental, moral, or religious sense. Its nearest approach to such meaning--and this still very remote--is its use with the suggestion of weakness and frailty. Broadly speaking, therefore, 1f7V is physical-religious-psychical; E is psychical-vital; "'IS is physical. But an instructive parallel may also be drawn between the usage of each of the three Hebrew terms and the corresponding Greek words, viz., between -lT and irv'dpea; between t,= and I,'vx; between 'It and oa&amp;pr. The fundamental meaning of M_- and u7rvea is the same, viz., wind. The first extant instances of this meaning of lrve-ua date from the fifth century B.c. r-~0 appears in this sense in the oldest Old Testament literature, and is therefore at least as old as the eighth century B.c. But in the same period also we find _-i meaning spirit, and used of the spirit of God. The application to the demonic spirit may perhaps be the earliest, but the application to the spirit of God seems to arise out of its use meaning wind, rather than from the idea of the demon, and the use to denote the spirit of man is apparently later than with reference to the spirit of God. Both these latter ideas retain a quantitative feeling, even after the terms have come to be used personally and indi- vidually. The meaning "breath" is apparently the latest of all to appear.</page><page sequence="21">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 79 The development of the usage of rjepea is somewhat different. From the primitive meaning "wind" arises the meaning "breath," and from this in a purely physical sense come the meanings "breath of life," "life." On this basis apparently is developed the concep- tion of a soul-stuff, out of which individual souls come and to which they return. At the close of the classical period there is the suggestion of an extension of this idea by which wPvea becomes the basis of all existence. In the post-classical period we shall see this developing into the conception of divine spirit, rpe 9a OBcov, at first at least quantitatively thought of. But of the deification of the irvPfe9a there are no discoverable traces in the classical period. Alike, therefore, in the starting-point and in the general range of usage there is a large measure of parallelism between the Hebrew and Greek terms, 7M_ and wrvisea. But the order in which mean- ings are developed is not the same, and the Hebrews were far in advance of the Greeks in developing the idea of the divine spirit. b. apparently begins with the notion of a living being resident in a living animal or man--the ghost, so to speak, within an em- bodied living being. The earliest extant usage of 4#vxj is to denote the shade of a once-living being, the ghost that escapes from the body when it dies. From these kindred starting-points both the Hebrew and the Greek terms develop with no marked difference in order, the meanings "life," that quality or element of a living being which constitutes it living, and "soul" as the seat of various emo- tions, capacities, etc. The Hebrew writers ascribe a ?. only to man and the lower animals (except as it is by anthropomorphism used of God), and this is also the use of Ovxj in most of the Greek writers, but Plato believes in a jPvxj of the universe, and Aristotle ascribes 4Pvxj (in a limited sense of the term) to plants. As to the capacity of the soul for existence apart from the body and after death, both Hebrew and Greek writers differ among themselves. Some of the Psalms affirm it, some seem to deny, Ecclesiastes is skeptical. So Homer and the tragic poets presuppose a shadowy existence after death; Socrates is agnostic about the future of the soul; Xenophon is hopeful; Plato affirms; and Aristotle denies. Both ) and o&amp;pt are primarily physical terms, both pass from the meaning "flesh" in the strict sense to the more general meaning</page><page sequence="22">80 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY "body." The Hebrew term is used by metonymy to denote one's kindred, and as a general term for man and animals, or for humanity as such. Neither term has any ethical significance. Plato regards the body as a drag upon the soul, conceiving that the latter can achieve its full freedom and highest development only when freed from the former, but he apparently never uses ayip in this connection, and does not ascribe to the o-6pa a distinctly ethical significance. Of any corrupting power of either body or flesh to drag down the soul there is no trace in the Old Testament. The lt is sometimes spoken of as weak, but never as a power for evil.
