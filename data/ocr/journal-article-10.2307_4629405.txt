<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ESSAY ILLUMINATED HEBREW MANUSCRIPT FACSIMILES BY LEILA AVRIN THERE IS NO COPYRIGHT ON THE WORD "FACSIMILE," AND publishers have taken the liberty of using it to denote any reproduction of a manuscript regardless of its fidelity to the original. This broad contemporary us- age of the term, which at one time meant a collotype reproduction, especially affects the Hebrew manu- script facsimile market, which has burgeoned since the 1960s. Here I will first survey Hebrew manuscript facsimiles since their appearance in the late nine- teenth century and then concentrate on two recent landmark publications by Facsimile Editions of Lon- don: the Kennicott Bible (2 v., 1985, v. 2 Introduction) and the Rothschild Miscellany (2 v., 1989, v. 2 A Scholarly Commentary). The first Hebrew manuscript facsimile was the Sara- jevo Haggadah, published in 1898, at a time when European scholars were just becoming aware of the existence of medievalJewish manuscript art. The col- lotype facsimilewas in black and white, notunusual for its day, although a few color illustrations from this and other Hebrew manuscripts appeared in the facsimile itself and in the companion volume. This haggadah (the book read at the home ceremony on the eve of Passover), written and illustrated in Catalonia in the first half of the fourteenth century, had been acquired only four years before its publication by the Bosnian National Museum in Sarajevo from a family forced by poverty to sell it. While it is not the most splendid of manuscripts of its time and genre, it is unique because of its full cycle of biblical illustrations preceding the haggadah text, commencing with the Creation and ending with the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. Also illustrated are preparations for the Passover and synagogue scenes, which may indicate aJewish artist. No artist's colophon from Sefardi (Spanish) haggadot has come down to us to prove or disprove this theory. The companion text-volume for the Sarajevo Hagga- dah was written by David Heinrich Muller, a scholar of Semitic languages, and Julius von Schlosser, an art historian. Their chapters describe the Passover festival and its customs, the contents of the manuscript, and its relation to other known illustrated haggadot of both Sefardi and Ashkenazi (German) origin in European collections. A final chapter on the history ofJewish art was written by David Kaufmann, a scholar/collector of Hebrew manuscripts. Although the 1898 essays now seem antiquated, the authors established the tradition of the scholarly commentaryvolume for future facsim- iles. The Sarajevo Haggadah facsimile reproduced the illustrated pages only, not the text. Most of today's Hebrew facsimiles reproduce the entire text. The next facsimile, published in Leipzig in 1927-28, was the Darmstadt Haggadah (Landesbibliothek, Darmstadt, Codex Orientalis 8), an Ashkenazi hagga- dah written in the middle Rhine region in the second quarter of the fifteenth century, with illustrations by a non-Jewish artist. Itwas a fine limited-edition collotype but with its gold leaf rendered in ink. For the compan- ion volume several scholars contributed essays on scribal and artistic aspects of the manuscript, the book's history, and its binding. In 1971-72, Propylaen in Berlin and Ullstein in Frankfurt-am-Main published a new facsimile of the Darmstadt Haggadah, an eight- color printing with gold rendered by etched gold foil. A new group of scholars wrote articles for the com- mentary volume. As for the earlier volumes, the limit- ed market consisted of serious collectors and libraries with rare book collections. In 1957, the first popularly priced reproduction was published: the Kaufmann Haggadah, printed by offset lithography in Budapest. The edges of its reproduced pages were squared off and framed by white margins. An accompanying pamphlet contained an introduc- tion by Alexander Scheiber, director of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Sold at$15-25, itwas soon out of print. A second facsimile of the Sarajevo Haggadah followed in 1963, this one in color, for approximately the same price as the Kaufmann Haggadah had initial- lysold for. With its lithogaphic plates printed in France, it was issued in an unlimited edition in several coun- tries and reprinted for many years. Its introduction by historian Cecil Roth, included in the same volume, appeared in the language of each country in which it was published: the United States, England, France, Yugoslavia, Italy, Germany, and Israel. The Sarajevo Haggadah is the most-facsimiled Hebrew manuscript in existence, more because of its romantic history than its inherent beauty: in 1941, Nazis entering Sarajevo demanded that the manuscript be turned over to them. Fortunately, the secretary of the Bosnian Na- tional Museum's curator had just removed it under her shawl, hiding it with a local priest for the duration</page><page sequence="2">190 LEILA AVRIN of World War II. In 1983, a new edition appeared, a joint publication by two Yugoslav publishers. Pam- phlets in Hebrew and English (not the same articles) are boxed with the facsimile. The colors are somewhat less intense than those of the 1963 edition, which permits the outlines and more details in the original to be seen. The paper is slightly less shiny, and the blank leaves on the verso of the illustrations reproduce each of the original's blank leaves, rather than repeating the same two blank leaves seen throughout the 1963 edition. Popularly priced facsimiles-currently $100 and under-now appear at the rate of two to four per year. Generally, they have the following in common: an accompanying text by a well-known scholar who sum- marizes the researeh on the manuscript and some- times adds original analysis; a facsimile the size of the original and reproduced by offset lithography on medium-quality coated paper; squared-off pages, at times framed by neutral margins, to meet the needs of a standard binding. The best of the facsimiles of medieval manuscripts, in quality of both reproduction and scholarly commentary, have been published by Thames and Hudson in London: TheAshkenaziHagga- dah, British Library Add. Ms. 14762 (1985) and The Rylands Haggadah,John Rylands University Library of Manchester, Heb. Ms. 6 (1989). Their introductions include a few black-and-white illustrations of compar- ative material. Because both books have had copub- lishers in different countries, cover design and/or additional casing varies. Several publishers in Israel and Europe, especially in Germany, have brought out facsimiles of eighteenth-century haggadot and other Hebrew manuscripts, as well as the most important printed illustrated haggadot. Introductory texts are often minimal. But these publications, along with the moderately priced medieval manuscript reproduc- tions, have proved a boon for students ofJewish art since they permit study of the manuscript in its totality. Facsimiles on the high end of the market are essen- tial for academic rare book collections, as their repro- ductions are almost always much better than those of their moderately priced counterparts. After the 1927- 28 Darmstadt Haggadah, the next facsimile of its class was the Bird's Head Haggadah, published by Tarshish Books in Jerusalem for the Leo Ary Mayer Library (1965-67). This high-quality collotype facsimile was printed by MaxJaff6 in Vienna and sold for a modest $120. The overall effect of this charming south Ger- man manuscript of ca. 1300, now in the Israel Muse- um, was spoiled by the dark grey margins added to show the contours of the original. Publisher/scholar Moshe Spitzer edited the excellent introductory vol- ume by several authorities (whose names he often misspelled), which matched the facsimile in size and in casing. Next came the Golden Haggadah in the British Library (Add. Ms. 27210), the most sumptuous of fourteenth-century Sefardi haggadot, published by Eugrammia Press and the Trustees of the British Li- brary in 1970. Its $500 price again seems modest compared to facsimiles today, especially considering its rich gold-leaf backgrounds, reproduced with gold foil and bearing tooled diaper patterns. The publisher skimped, however, on the companion volume, whose red cloth binding clashes with the facsimile's hand- some calf binding, which reproduces the seventeenth- century tooling of the original. Its single essay, printed on shiny paper that has yellowed unevenly, is a de- tailed study of the illuminations written by Bezalel Narkiss, based on his Ph.D. dissertation. In the 1980s the Graz printer/publisher Akade- mische Druck- und Verlagsanstalt's, long famous for its collotype facsimiles, printed the Castellazo Pen- tateuch (1983, fortunately, since the original disap- peared), the Kaniel Megilla (1984), and two manu- scripts in thejewish National and University Library: a tiny Grace after Meals (1983, no introduction, printed on white paper that does not reflect the nuances of the parchment), and the giant Worms Mahzor (1985). The latter two were published by Cyelar Publishing Company, Ltd., London. A combination oflithographic printing methods was employed for the mahzor (festi- val prayer book). Nearly all of the Akademische Druck- u. Verlagsanstalt's facsimiles, long considered the tru- est to their originals, are printed on the same heavy paper, which shows the grain of the parchment and all the nuances of the original manuscript. But over the years their facsimiles have come to look more like one another than like the originals. Nevertheless, this style is frequently imitated by low-cost facsimile publishers using cheaper photographic and printing processes on thinner paper. This is what the expensive facsimiles, of both He- brew and non-Hebrew manuscripts, have in common: until recently, photographic reproduction of the orig- inal by collotype (with the negative now exposed on a gelatin-coated aluminum plate rather than on the glass plates of the past), which publishers claimed the most accurate method; a binding that attempts to duplicate that of the original or look like one contem- poraneous with it; a matching companion volume that usually includes the work of several scholars. There is no technical reason why ten thousand copies of these editions could not be printed because the aluminum plates used today can be mounted on rotary offset presses. Yet high-end editions are limited to between five hundred and six hundred copies, so that their value as collectors' items continues to rise. All fine facsimiles, Hebrew and non-Hebrew, are now priced between $2000 and $26,000. And until the entry of</page><page sequence="3">ILLUMINATED HEBREW MANUSCRIPT FACSIMILES 191 Facsimile Editions of London into the field, all fol- lowed the Akademische Druck style. To their credit, Linda and Michael Falter of Facsim- ile Editions have liberated the facsimile from the Akademische Druck look by reproducing each aspect of the original-its vellum, its ink, its colors, its gold and silver paint and leaf, and its binding. The first manuscript they chose was one of the most significant and handsome, the Kennicott Bible (Oxford, Bodle- ian Library Kennicott I), named for the Christian Hebraistwho, as librarian, acquired it for the Radcliffe College Library in 1771. The complete Bible was writ- ten in 1476 in La Coruria, northwestern Spain (Gali- cia), by the outstanding scribe Moses ibn Zabara. The artistwho illuminated and decorated 238 of the manu- script's 922 pages,Joseph ibn Hayyim, wasJewish. The Bible was commissioned by Isaac ben Solomon di Braga, who may have been a successful cloth mer- chant, according to the introduction. He may have left La Corunia well before the expulsion of the Jews in 1492, for the spectacular red morocco binding in the form of a box, tooled in Mudejar style, was made by a Jewish binder active in Lisbon in the final quarter of the fifteenth century. At least six known box bindings, apparently on Hebrew books only, come from this Lisbon workshop.' After a possible residence in Lis- bon, from which the Jews were expelled in 1496-97, Isaac di Braga undoubtedly immigrated to Germany because there a dark brownish-black calfskin case was made for the Bible, executed with a combination of molded leather and cuir ciseletechniques. The Bible in its Mudejar box binding fit into the case after its metal bosses were removed. The name Isaac is incised within a central shield. The Kennicott Bible-binding, box, and all-is per- fectly preserved (there are a few red and tan leather repairs on the cover). Perhaps only thirty people have been allowed to study it at the Bodleian over the years. Its reproduction is thus a service to scholars as well as a delight to collectors. The Falters first sought to duplicate the look and feel, thickness and opacity of parchment as closely as possible. More than a year of experimentation went into making the special paper alone, manufactured by a small Alpine mill in Italy. The final printing, by Luigi Canton (Grafiche Milani), was accomplished on this oily, vegetable-fiber paper, with the offset-lithographic printing in eleven colors ren- dered cross-grain to enhance the parchment effect. Perfect color matching was achieved by constantly checking each proof of the laser-produced color sep- arations against the original manuscript. Some proofs were remade as many as four times. Imitation gold and silver foil were afterwards applied by hand, and the fore-edges of the facsimile were gilt (the original's are gilt and gauffered). The tooling on all six sides of the morocco box binding was reproduced by dies, so the surface of the simulated blind-tooling appears to be too shallow and smooth, emphasizing its machine- made look. On the original manuscript, the upper cover, which acts as a lid for the box, no longer fits tightly due to the upward pressure of the buckling parchment. This warped condition was not repro- duced. The companion volume, bound in untooled moroc- co like the facsimile volume with the title embossed and printed on fine paper, was written by Bezalel Narkiss and Aliza Cohen-Mushlin of the Hebrew Uni- versity ofJerusalem. Here one would have liked to see a study by a textual scholar of Kennicott's text and its place in the transmission of the Bible text and its Masorah, as well as a more thorough and accurate codicological description by someone associated with the Hebrew Palaeography Project in Jerusalem. Since the field of both authors is manuscript illumination, however, the introduction suffers from omissions and misinformation in subjects outside the areas of deco- ration and illustration. Much of the misinformation can be found in the discussion of the Kennicott Bible's binding. Here are some examples: 1. "Cost of the binding negligible" (p. 23). It is doubtful that the cost of the binding, while less than the cost of illuminating, was negligible, for not only was a box binding more complicated to craft, but the design and tooling were also more intricate than tooling found on most Hebrew manuscripts of the fifteenth century and far more complex than those of the first half of the fourteenth century, the date of the contract on which the authors base this conclusion. 2. "After sewing each of the quires, the binder tied their cords together at the back into six double, knot- ted cords which were glued to the spine" (p. 85). Binders then as now sewed each quire, one by one, onto lay cords that had been strung on a sewing frame. This can be seen in a twelfth-century drawing in the Staatsbibliothek Bamberg, Msc. Patr. 5, f. lr.2 Double thongs of leather, customary for Spain, were used for the Kennicott Bible. The remaining ends of the leath- er lay cords, after being cut from the sewing frame, were laced into the boards cut for the covers. The sides of the box would have been built up from the lower cover before it was attached. 3. "These bands were raised with special tweezers to enclose the double, knotted cordswhile the skin of the spine was still damp and could be stretched" (p. 85). Bands are nipped with a band nipper either to straight- en them or, after the leather is glued to the spine, to emphasize them, not to produce them. Nor would any binder apply the leather to the boards before first sewing the quires on lay cords, or before the boards were attached, because one piece of leather covered</page><page sequence="4">192 LEILA AVRIN the whole book and because he would have to know the exact width of the spine. 4. Morocco is tanned goatskin, not red-brown tinted leather, as implied (p. 85). 5. "The next stage was to fix the wooden head and tail sides to the box, covering them with more goat- skin, glued and smoothed with an ivory spatula so that the overlappingjoinswould be distinguished onlywith difficulty" (p. 85). The entire box, sides and all, was covered with one skin. There are no overlappingjoins; that is why they cannot be seen. 6. The tools would have been made of brass, not iron, which would have ruined the damp leather. Rope tool designs are not made with actual tiny ropes ("a piece of rope," p. 85) butwith a metal tool that has a relief design resembling rope. Dots were not made by an awl, which would have broken the surface of the leather, but by a metal tool with a tiny relief circle on its head. 7. Contrary to an opinion cited by the authors (p. 87),' what is characteristic of fifteenth-century Mude- jar tooling, as opposed to fourteenth-century, is the complex interlace based on the circle, as seen on the Kennicott Bible, not the greater width of the reserve strapwork bands. 8. It is easier to believe that the binder came to Lisbon from Toledo in the last quarter of the fifteenth century, because the Mudejar patterns on the box bindings are similar to those of Toledo bindings, than to believe that the style originated in Portugal before its transmission to Toledo (p. 88) and that Isaac di Braga sent his precious manuscript to Castille to be bound. Nor is the style characteristic of Portuguese tooling, which is relatively simple.4 Complex Mudejar tooling of bindings associated with books written, printed, or decorated in Lisbon was more likely to have been done by emigrating Jewish or converso binders from Spain. 9. A "doublure" is not "two layers of vellum" (p. 50), but the term for a leather (in later periods, fabric or decorated paper) lining inside of the cover. A paste- down, found in the same place and with the same decorative purpose, is made of parchment or paper, with designs painted or cut out. Pastedowns are not tooled. Therefore comparing the Kennicott's paste- downs to blind- and gold-tooled doublures (p. 87) is like comparing apples with oranges. 10. The additional calfskin brown-black case was not at all characteristic of Spain. The example of the cuir- cisele and stippled box (not a binding) from Henry Thomas, Early Spanish Boohbindings, is so German-look- ing that it is more reasonable to believe that it was made in Germany, or by a German binder, from leather (not morocco) .5 Contrary to what the authors state, cuir ciselM was not a Spanish binding technique and Mude~jar tooling was not accomplished by a cut leather technique. Thomas himself corrects the error made by E. P. Goldschmidt.6 The leather case for the Kennicott would have been made by a binder, not a stationer (p. 89), who was essentially a provider of materials for books, exemplars for copying, or scribal services. 11. "[I]t can be deduced that at least the penulti- mate quire, if not the whole Bible, was detached from the spine.... The present stitching and gluing of the quires to the spine seems to have been done after the manuscript reached the Radcliffe Library over two hundred years ago" (pp. 30, 88). As for the inverted imprint of the cut-out pastedown of the upper cover, observed by the authors on the last page of the penul- timate quire, f. 445v (not seen in the facsimile), it can better be explained by the possibility that the binder stacked the painted cut-out parchmentwith that quire, onto which the pattern bled, before the pastedown was glued to the upper inner cover. Or he may have pressed the cut-out parchment in the already-sewn book. It is hardly likely that a later Christian owner would have taken apart such a large and superbly bound bookjust to have the decorated arcades in the wrong place upside down at the beginning of the book, and then that the Radcliffe Library would have taken the book apart again to put the quire in its correct place. The authors could easily have verified that the Kennicott's present sewing and binding are the original by consulting Christopher Clarkson, the noted authority in conservation and binding, who was then Conservation Officer at the Bodleian Library. The strength of the introduction lies in its detailed study of the decorations and illuminations by the artist Joseph ibn Hayyim, who, the authors believe, may have been the son of the artist Abraham ben Judah ibn Hayyim, author of a treatise written in Judeo-Portu- guese on manuscript illumination in Loule, Portugal, apparently in 1462. The Bible's illuminations include the arcaded pages framing Rabbi David Kimhi's gram- matical treatise, SeferMikhlol, at the beginning and end of the Bible; the carpet pages between the main sec- tions of the Bible; the decorated parasha ornaments; the embellished panels and frames at the end of individual books, Psalm numerals and the scribe's colophon, display letters, and text illustrations; the Menorah and implements of the Sanctuary, a popular Sefardi iconography; the micrography; and the artist's colophon. The generous inclusion of both black-and- white and color illustrations to demonstrate the au- thors' conclusions is exceptionally useful to students and scholars. Particularly fascinating is the discussion of how long it took to write the Bible (perhaps ten months), and how much the illuminator may have earned, even though some of the conclusions were based on the previously mentioned contract to</page><page sequence="5">ILLUMINATED HEBREW MANUSCRIPT FACSIMILES 193 illuminate and bind a Hebrew manuscriptwritten one hundred fifty years earlier in Majorca. It may very well be, as the authors assume, that the scribe lived with and was supported by the patron during the time he wrote the Bible, a known but not universal medievalJewish practice. But we do not know whetherJewish illumina- tors lived with their patrons. The stationer certainly would not have lodged with the patron (p. 94), nor would the bookbinder have, for even if Isaac di Braga already lived in Lisbon when the book was bound, it would have been a major undertaking to move the sewing frame, presses, and tools to the patron's home. Nor is it reasonable to believe that the scribe would have had to pay the illuminator and the binder out of his own fee (although he or a stationer may very well have recommended these craftspersons). The major source for the design of the layout, as well as stylistic and iconographic aspects of the Kennicott Bible, was the Cervera Bible, written and decorated in this Spanish town in 1300. Birth records of 1375 and 1439 written in La Coruuia show that the Cervera Bible was in that Galician town for at least a century before it became a model for the Kennicott Bible. The de- lightful zoo- and anthropomorphic colophon is but one of several instances ofJoseph ibn Hayyim's bor- rowings from the illuminations ofJoseph the French- man, artist of the earlier manuscript. The authors thoroughly examine other possible sources of the Kennicott Bible's style and iconography: earlier Castil- lian Bibles, Hebrew illuminated manuscripts from the Lisbon "workshop" of the final quarter of the fifteenth century, and engraved mid-fifteenth-century playing cards from Germany by "the Master of the Power of Women." The relatively few errors in the introduction do not detract from the great value of the Kennicott Bible facsimile. The only aspects of the original that the Falters have not reproduced in the two facsimiles they have published thus far are the original quire sewing for the binding and the smell of the manuscripts. To my mind, the Kennicott is surpassed only by the sec- ond facsimile published by the Falters: the Rothschild Miscellany. The Rothschild Miscellany, the most lavish of all illuminated Hebrew manuscripts with 816 of its 948 pages elegantly decorated or illustrated, was illuminat- ed in northern Italy between 1465 and 1475. At one time part of the collection of the Paris Rothschilds, it was stolen by the Nazis and after World War II was offered for sale in New York, where it was recognized and eventually given as a gift to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem byJames de Rothschild. A new paper, made by the same mill, reproduced the thin, soft vellum of the original. Because real gold would not stick to this special paper, imitation gold again had to be substituted, but it was hand applied to a built-up layer to reproduce the effect of the original's burnished gold leaf. Since flat gold and powdered gold were also used in the original, all three types were reproduced accurately. Even the original pricking, used to mark the place for ruling scribal guidelines, was imitated. The edges of the printed pages were cut out and "aged" and gilt with twenty-three-carat gold leaf. The Rothschild Miscellany, unlike the Kennicott Bible, was disbound from its modern binding in order to photograph it for the facsimile, which enabled scholars to examine all of its codicological details, as Iris Fishof, Chief Curator ofJudaica and Ethnography at the Israel Museum, points out in her brief introduc- tion. The nickname for the almost perfectly intact manu- script (only three leaves are missing)-Kol-Bo ("Every- thing-in-it")-is apt, for it contains thirty-seven dis- tinct texts, opening with Psalms, followed by two halakhic Uewish legal) treatises, then Job (with com- mentary) and Proverbs. These opening biblical quires with their commentaries were written by two different scribes after the rest of the manuscript was completed but before the illumination was begun. The bulk of the manuscript contains the prayer book for daily, sab- bath, and festival worship; the Passover haggadah; selected works by Maimonides; liturgical poetry and marriage hymns; history byYosifon (the tenth-century pseudo-Josephus); the MeshalHaKadmoni-a Hebrew fable book comparable to the Bidpai Fables (Kalilah wa-Dimnah)-composed in Spain in 1281 by Isaac ibn Sahula; other moralistic works; poetry byJudah Hale- vi; and a calendar. The pages were laid out by the scribe with a main text surrounded by marginal small- er texts, which contain Rashi's commentaries along- side the three biblical books, plus moral, halakhic, and historical treatises, and other works that were related to the main sections on the same page. For the scholarly commentary volume, the publish- ers wisely commissioned several essays: on the histori- cal background of thejews of Italy, by Shlomo Simon- sohn; on each of the Miscellany's literary units, by Israel Ta-Shema; on palaeographical and codicologi- cal aspects of the manuscript, by Malachi Beit-Arie; on the style and iconography of the illustrations, by Lu- isella Mortara-Ottolenghi. These authors independent- ly conclude that the manuscript must have been pro- duced in northern Italy for ajew of Ashkenazi origin between 1453 and 1479/80. The patron was Moshe ben Yekutiel Ha-Kohen, a banker, member of the Ashkenazi settlement in north- ern Italy, in the vicinity of Treviso. His name appears in the prayerbook section in a blessing made for the person called up to recite the benediction for the Torah reading in the synagogue, the Mi</page><page sequence="6">194 LEILA AVRIN She-berach (f. 106r). Moshe HaKohen arrived in Cre- mona in 1465 and acquired a bank which was his until 1475, the year in which he probably died. As an active moneylender, he was on good terms with the Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, and acted as arbitrator in disputes concerningJews. One of the Miscellany's artists, Bonifacio Bembo, worked for the Sforza family and was accustomed to following detailed directions for the proper execution of paintings for his patrons. So the scenes in the Miscellany that illustrate Jewish rituals and holiday customs are painted with great accuracy, although at times, as Mortara-Ottolenghi points out, iconography was drawn from Christian manuscripts. For ItalianJewish manuscripts, itwas the exceptionally close coordination of the scribe or pa- tron and the artist that produced this realism and conveys such a splendid idea of Renaissance Jewish culture. Who was the scribe? As was the common Ashkenazi practice, he did not leave a colophon, nor did he indicate his identity by dotting a name or an acrostic in the text. But his name may by found, according to Beit-Arie, at the end of a treatise on the calendar cycles, where he wrote, "Be strong and of good courage. Shabbetai [the name] selah. Amen." In his codicological study Malachi Beit-Arie, Profes- sor of Codicology and Palaeography at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and former director of the Jewish National and University Library, found that the first seven quires with biblical texts were written by perhaps two scribes separately from the rest of the manuscript, which was written entirely by a single scribe (his foliation and table of contents on f. 473r as well as different handwriting prove this). The square Ashkenazi script found in many Hebrew manuscripts from northern Italy was used for the main, inner text (with a few pages in classic Ashkenazi style), and a smaller, semi-cursive hand for the outer, marginal text. One of Beit-Arie's important discoveries about the disbound manuscript was the enumeration of the illustrations, consecutively for each separate quire, found in the inner margins close to the fold and at times in the outer margins (most of these were cut off in later trimming). These were written in Indo-Arabic numerals for the benefit of the non-Jewish artists. In one instance the scribe wrote "painting" in Hebrew as well. Beit-Arie demonstrates that the scribe laid out his text ahead of time with planned spaces for all the illustrations, the common practice for manuscript illumination. Display letters-the initial words-were written after the textwas completed (since a change of quill was necessary), and later the illuminator covered these with gold. According to the author, the system of numbering "may well prove the illustrations were copied from a model" and "artists . . . referred to parallel numbering in a model in order to copy relevant miniatures" (pp. 92, 98). It would have been interesting to know more precisely how these numbers may have been used. Mortara-Ottolenghi believes that the artists numbered the illustrations first and then inserted the numerals in the margins. Obviously, there was no one model codex, for the iconography was too varied, as we learn from Mortara-Ottolenghi's essay. Perhaps the numbers referred to a list made by scribe and patron together, which was then reviewed by the artist(s) with scribe or patron, and preliminary sketch- es were produced quire by quire. The codicological features of the manuscript are shown by Beit-Arie to be part Ashkenazi and part Italian in character. No other single dated Hebrew manuscript has all of the exact same characteristics: six-sheet quires, nearly all of very thin and refined vellum whose flesh and hair sides are at times distin- guishable, at times alike (equalized), and whose sides are not always matched at a given opening; pricking of inner and outer margins, with double prickings ob- served for the complex ruling of guidelines for the inner and outer texts' two sizes of script (typical of Ashkenazi manuscripts); ruling with thin black lead point. As in Ashkenazi practice (where letters were written between two ruled lines), in the Rothschild Miscellany one additional line was ruled below the last planned written line, even though the letters were suspended from the upper line. (This may reflect a practice carried over from Torah-scroll writing.) Oth- er codicological aspects discussed are graphic fillers and other devices used to justify margins, and catch- words drawn from the square-hand inner text at the end of the quire. In all cases, the author brings numer- ous examples from Germany and Italy, as well as exceptions to the rule, from his deep knowledge of medieval Hebrew manuscripts and from the data gath- ered by the Hebrew Palaeography Project in Jerusa- lem. Such an essay for the Kennicott Bible facsimile would have been most welcome. The essay on the illuminations and the artists by Louisella Mortara-Ottolenghi, Professor of Codicolo- gy and History of Illumination at the Universita degli Studi di Milano, emphasizes the importance of this manuscript as a masterpiece of Italian miniature art. Mortara-Ottolenghi concludes that the miniatureswere executed by two Lombard workshops between 1465 and 1475, with the work divided among numerous artists and miniaturists. The masters of these work- shops were Bonifacio Bembo and Cristoforo De Predis (the latter for the biblical books). As with other com- parable works, the artists were undoubtedly all Chris- tian. For the illustrations they relied on several mod- els, among them Ashkenazi, Sefardi, and Italian Hebrew illuminated manuscripts. Sometimes the artists drew from their own works or from those of</page><page sequence="7">ILLUMINATED HEBREW MANUSCRIPT FACSIMILES 195 other illuminators of Christian books and art. Some illuminations were invented specifically for the texts they illustrated; some may have been suggested by the patron. There was always perfect coordination ofscribe, patron, and artist. Because the binding was modern and not particular- ly distinguished, the publishers decided to commis- sion a leather binding that would resemble one con- temporaneous with the manuscript. The selected model (British Library, Ms. Henry Davis gift, M73) has a brown goatskin (morocco) binding with blind tool- ing in Mudejar style, a style known in Italy in the latter quarter of the fifteenth century. The catches and plates for the thongs were made of silver. My few criticisms of the essays in the companion volume could have been avoided by more careful editing. One concerns imprecise translations from Hebrew to English. For example, Beit Arie uses the term "parchment" for vellum. This is understandable because the Hebrew term klaf applies to both, some- times qualified by "coarse" or "delicate." Thus the leaves, which very well may be of uterine vellum, are called parchment, the term associated today with the heavier product. Similarly, "devices to produce an even left margin" (p. 108ff.) is a rather roundabout way of describing justification. There are a few errors in punctuation, inconsistent capitalization, missing words, inexplicable references to index cards in foot- notes, and a few pages out of order (192-93 for 194- 95). Lack of coordination among articles can be seen in Simonsohn's strange conclusion that "[the patron's] identity and that of the scribe and artist are yet to be determined" when Beit-Arie and Mortara-Ottolenghi had so brilliantlyidentified them.And inviewof all the research in the past century onJewish art of all ages, it seems naive for a historian to maintain: "Representa- tional art, although not a major pursuit amongJews before modern times, chiefly due to the biblical in- junction contained in the Ten Commandments, was not altogether avoided, being employed mainly for decorative or illustrative purposes." A map of Italy showing cities and regions mentioned in all of the essays would have been most useful (as a map of Spain would have been for the Kennicott Bible). Finally, I take issue with Mortara-Ottolenghi's dat- ing of Gershom Soncino's first printed edition of the Meshal HaKadmoni in Brescia to 1490-91. It should probably be dated to 1491-92 at earliest. This calcula- tion is based on recent research by Esther Bienenfeld, who demonstrated that the iconography of woodcuts is often closer to the Venice, January 1491 edition of Aesop's Fables than to the illustrations of the Roths- child Miscellany's Meshal HaKadmoni.7 It would have been interesting for the author to have compared the iconography of this section to manuscript editions of Aesop's Fables, such as the "Medici Aesop" (Florence, 1488), slightly later than the Rothschild Miscellany.8 While the layout of the illustrations and style of the Spencer Aesop and the Miscellany's Meshal HaKadmo- ni are not identical, the Miscellany's fable section is more similar stylistically and iconographically to the Greek manuscript than it is to any of the other four Hebrew manuscript copies of the Meshal HaKadmoni that were produced before the printed edition ap- peared. But all in all, the commentary volume is worthy of the magnificentfacsimile, and one can look forward to more facsimiles produced by the Falters of Facsimile Editions. (Next is the Barcelona Haggadah in the British Library.) At a recent seminar on Jewish art, academics be- moaned the fact that facsimiles are far beyond the budget of the scholars who need them most. This unfortunate situation makes it mandatory for large academic libraries where relevant courses are taught to invest in them. The price of these two magnificently produced facsimiles, each now close to $7000, looks like a bargain compared to the recent Book of Kells facsimile at $18,000. The Alba Bible, scheduled for 1992, will cost $26,000. Notes 1.
