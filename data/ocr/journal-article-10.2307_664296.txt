<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AFRICAN EXPEDITION: I, EGYPT By HENRY FIELD' DURING the latter part of August Wendell Phillips invited me to join the Egyptian Phase of the University of California African Expedition. It had long been my desire to search for Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic implements in Sinai,2 the land-bridge between Asia and Africa. For in this region, especially in the northern zone, flint tools and flakes left by the ancient intercontinental migrants should lie on the surface. Naturally, one would expect to find closer typological resemblances to the cultures of the Nile Valley on the western side of the Sinai Peninsula and correspondingly closer resemblances to Palestine, Syria and Trans-Jordan on the east. Here should be found the cultural links3 between Afrasia, Asafrica or Eurafrasia. Since Professor William F. Albright of Johns Hopkins University had just accepted the position as Archeological Adviser to the Expedition, our combined archeological interests ranged from Lower Paleolithic to historical times. In addition, anthropometric data and photographs of Beduins were to be obtained on as large a series as proved practicable during the preliminary survey. On December 15, thanks to the generous co-operation of Nukrashi Pasha, the Prime Minister, and Sanhoury Pasha, Minister of Education, we were able to leave for a five-week reconnaissance survey in Sinai. The party4 consisted of William B. Terry, Field executive and organizer, William F. Albright, S. A. 1 Appointed on October 1, 1947, as Physical Anthropologist to the Expedition by President Robert G. Sproul. 2 In order to obtain background information on the land and people of Sinai, with special reference to prehistory and anthropometry, the program was discussed with the following: Dr. T. Dale Stewart, U. S. National Museum; Dr. Wilton M. Krogman, University of Pennsylvania; Dr. William K. Gregory, American Museum of Natural History; Dr. Ralph Linton, Yale Uni- versity; Dr. E. A. Hooton and Dr. Hallam L. Movius, Peabody Museum, Harvard; Sir Arthur Keith, Professor Dorothy Garrod, Miss Gertrude Caton Thompson, and J. C. Trevor in England; Mr. Harper Kelly, Muse du Trocad6ro, Paris; and Professor Sergio Sergi, Rome. Stone implements from Sinai xyere examined in the Mus6e de Trocad6ro and from adjoining areas in the Jerusalem and Cairo Museums. Because of the cholera epidemic it was decided to delay arrival in Egypt; this gave an opportunity for scanning the literature. Dr. O. H. Little, Chief, Geological Survey of Egypt, provided many valuable references. For general references see Lorin, 1928-1929, Bib. Giog. Egypte. 3 Cf. Waechter and Seton-Williams, 1938; Cornwall, 1946, especially p. 39 where a typo- logically Acheulian handaxe 7.25 in. long has been reported from Dawadami in the heart of Arabia about 375 miles from the Persian Gulf; Field, 1929, 1932, and 1933; Caton Thompson, 1946a, and 1946b; Bachathy, 1942; and Colt, 1948. Standard references such as those of Sandford and Arkell, and Jarvis and Garrod are presumed to be known to the reader. 4 At Abu Zenima we were joined by Wendell Phillips, leader of the Expedition, Mrs. Terry, Business Manager of the Expedition, and Walter Thompson, technical assistant. We were also supported by Captain Grammar G. Edwards, USMC, chief of transportation, who assisted in planning the Sinai Phase, but remained at Kom Oshim in the Faiyum. 479</page><page sequence="2">480 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 50, 1948 Huzayyin,6 Professor of Geography at Farouk I University in Alexandria, and Ahmed Lutfi, representative of the Department of Antiquities in Cairo. Our first open-air site (SSI) was near Kilometer 115 east of Ismailia6 on the main paved road leading to Palestine. Upon a gravel-covered slope near the western end of Jebel Maghara a number of microlithic crescents' bearing delicate re- touches were found within a small area, indicating a Mesolithic workshop. It was suggested that these were tips for reed shafts serving as arrows. The entire series of implements from this station ranged apparently from Natufian to Predynastic, with the preponderance of affinities westward toward the Nile Valley. Near Kilometer 189 we collected some flint flakes deeply patinated and almost greasy with desert varnish. These appeared to me to link more closely with those from Trans-Jordan and the North Arabian Desert than those to the west. Here at these two surface sites at least were indications that we were on the land-bridge between Asia and Africa. At El-Arish, capital of Sinai, we presented ourselves to General Abd el- Hamid Bey Zeki, who assured us of every assistance, at the same time calling attention to certain geographical restrictions because of the Military Zone8 in which we were to operate. El-Arish, with a modern population of about 10,000, was founded, according to a local informant, in 1575 by Selim I. The Roman remains standing near the Citadel were imported from the neighbor- hood. Southwest of El-Arish in the foothills of the Risan Aneiza some Arab potsherds were found and at a slightly higher level some sherds of recent Turk- ish origin, the latter of a gray ware often ornamented with narrow lines. Near the summit were Roman sherds of the third or fourth century.9 Over a small crest lay a Roman pavement (lithostroton) with trimmed blocks of local stone, 5 Leading prehistorian in Egypt.

He also collected another series at R.L. 30 m. near Helwan-West boundary; catalog No. 16609. In this general area attention must be called to a few flakes from the summit of Jebel Attaqa west of Suez, collected by Mr. and Mrs. Jacques Daumas of the Suez Canal Co., Port Tewfiq. Mr. Daumas, who showed them to me privately, is preparing for publication a list of archeological sites and monuments (stone circles, nawamis, etc.) in southern Sinai.

The method of construction was similar to that of a Roman road. There appeared to be no ruined buildings nearby. Another day, after walking down the Wadi el-Arish10 for several hours near Maqdaba between El-Arish and Abu Aweiqila, I found several rolled and a few unrolled flakes-poor and dateless, but with definite evidence of human workmanship. Because the shifting sand dunes covered the greater part of the lower reaches of the Wadi el-Arish, all historical and the greater part of the proto- historical and prehistoric traces lie buried. Hence after a few days we were forced to abandon our reconnaissance survey of this area. However, before moving across Sinai to our next objectives in the Abu Zenima area on the Gulf of Suez, we were fortunate to discover at El-Rawafa', two miles east of Abu Aweiqila,"11 a Lower Paleolithic station. On the summit of a low hill were hundreds of flakes and many flint implements dark in patina and frequently with abraded edges. On the western slope in a small gully were yellowish-white coups-de-poing in profusion. Within two hours a superb series, including scrapers, was collected.12 This is one of the most important surface stations'3 in Southwestern Asia. The discovery of this site was of particular significance because the Abb6 Breuil had collected deeply patinated surface o10 H. W. Seton-Kerr collected one coup-de-poing on the surface 20 miles south of El-Arish and some rough flakes 15-20 miles south of El-Arish. These specimens are on exhibition in the Geological Museum, Cairo. '1 According to Murray, 1947, four kilometers south along the Wadi el-Arish a rectangular tomb stands on the summit of a bluff. Here every April Tarabin women deposit cruciform images during a ceremonial visit to this sanctuary. The Tarabin explain the crosses as being similar to their tribal mark (wasm). In a private communication dated January 27, 1948, Mr. Murray com- ments: "My personal theory of these queer objects is that the local Arabs had an annual ceremony in Christian times of depositing crosses on graves and that, when they became Moslem, they buried their corpses in the new Moslem cemetery but deposited the crosses (or souls) in the old Christian one. Sheikh Zeidan said that the custom was once general in Sinai." The Sulubba (Sleyb), who live in Syria, Trans-Jordan and Iraq, are called "People of the Cross" and wear a cross tattooed on an inner forearm, usually the right. See Glubb, 1943. All our informants assured us that there are no Sulubba in Sinai. However, Murray (p. 269) writes: "I saw four tents at Tor in 1933-the only time I have met them." 12 In this, Dr. Huzayyin and I were assisted by Professor Albright, Mr. Terry, Lutfi Effendi and the sharp-eyed and trained excavators, four Guftis, whose expert assistance throughout our work in Sinai must be recorded. From Quft (ancient Coptos) on the Nile Sir Flinders Petrie and later Dr. Reisner and many others have recruited workmen for their excavations. During the past fifty years this skill has been handed from father to son and the majority of expedition foremen in Egypt are Guftis, who take a special pride in their work. This material from El-Rawafa' (er-Raw- Afi) as well as all flints from northern Sinai will be published by Dr. Huzayyin. 'a Near Der'a in southern Syria, during 1928 while leader of the Field Museum North Ara- bian Desert Expedition, I found similar, almost white handaxes, and scrapers on the surface of a slope east of the Amman-Der'a road. Similar types occur in central and southwestern Palestine.</page><page sequence="4">482 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 50, 1948 flint implements'4 from E1-Fallak, Tell Umm Khuraiba, Aqlat el-Sabha and Ain Qudairat in the El-Kossaime area, some fifteen miles to the southeast, but out of bounds to the Expedition at this time. After five days we left El-Arish for Abu Zenima viA Bir Hasana, Nekhl and El-Shatt. Turning south at Kilometer 156 on the Abu Aweiqila-Ismailia paved road just west of Jebel Libni, the track lay through a broad, flat wadi between Jebel el-Halal and Jebel Yeleq. Albright found'5 on December 19, about two kilometers off the main road, a Neolithic station located on the gravelly surface of the rolling plain between areas of sand. Here were flint blades and two-edged knives as well as a fine tanged spearhead. Some heavily patinated flints were also found, all showing marks of wind and water erosion. About two kilometers beyond this point, on slightly higher ground, some deeply patinated flint flakes were obtained. We continued across deep sand to Bir Hasana. While Huzayyin and the others visited the depression beneath the southern flank of crescent-shaped Jebel el-Halal, I drove northwest to the Wadi el-Letheili, about ten miles from Bir Hasana. In this area only two flint flakes were found. However, on the return trip, south of the track on a low flint and gravel-covered hill about two miles airline from Bir Hasana were many flakes, scrapers and cores, all heavily patinated. This station resembled that found by the Abbe Breuil some twelve years before at Ain Qudairat. The area south of Jebel el-Halal yielded but a few flakes'6 of indeterminate age. Between Bir Hasana and the former capital of Sinai, Nekhl, and situated close to its geographical center, a few scattered flakes were found, some in the Wadi Jidil, others in the Wadi el-Bruq. Near the road from Nekhl to El- Shatt we found some implements linking our chain of surface stations from El-Rawafa' to the Suez Canal. At Mile 57 from Nekhl in the Wadi Bir Hisn east of Jubeil Hisn a coup-de-poing of Acheulian type was found together with some pottery fragments and a blue bead. Nearby was a well with good water in quantity. This trans-desert track across the Wilderness of Tih has been used from Old Stone Age to modern times. During the next six miles we stopped several times to collect a few implements and many flakes. 14 This collection, as yet unpublished, was examined by Wendell Phillips and myself in the Trocad~ro Museum, Paris, on November 12, 1947, through the courtesy of Mr. Harper Kelley. Many of these large, crude flakes were reminiscent of my collections from Trans-Jordan and western Iraq obtained by Field Museum North Arabian Desert Expeditions, 1927-1928 and 1934. See also Woolley and Lawrence, 1915. Nb. The Wadi el-Araba, which lies about eighty-five miles northeast of Rawaca', yielded to Doughty and more recent archeologists a fine series of handaxes. '6 These notes were supplied by Professor W. F. Albright. 16 Despite this poor result I am still of the opinion that this area must have been visited by man in a Paleolithic phase of culture; hence a further search is desirable, for Jebel el-Halal lies on a migration route and water has long been available. Furthermore, game on these slopes must have attracted the ancient hunters.</page><page sequence="5">FIELD] THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AFRICAN EXPEDITION 483 Here on December 23 we turned southward"17 to Abu Zenima on the shore of the Gulf of Suez. During the next twenty-six days the following results were obtained in southwestern Sinai. PALEOLITHIC 1. On a low chain of black mounds bordering the northern bank of the Wadi Khraiza, flint implements, including some delicately retouched side scrapers, were collected. This was our first station with typologically Paleo- lithic implements in southwestern Sinai. 2. About three miles from the entrance to the Wadi Ba'ba'a'8 on the left stands a black flint-covered low hill bisected by a narrow wadi. On both sides, especially on the southern slope, large, heavily patinated flint flakes with clear bulbs of percussion were found. Later, a fine series of scrapers, flakes and rejects was assembled.9 This collection was reminiscent of the Abb6 Breuil's series from Ain Qudairat20 in northern Sinai and those from the Rutba21 area in western Iraq. NEOLITHIC No evidence of Neolithic22 occupation was found. STONE MONUMENTS 1. On the left bank, about fifteen miles up the Wadi Solaf from Feiran Oasis, stands a group of low-walled enclosures, many of them roughly circular. At one point a single monolith (4' 6") was joined by a low wall. There appeared to be several graves, possibly Byzantine or later. Along this same wadi toward the Wadi es-Sheikh several cemeteries, some with a hundred graves, were recorded. Salah Umbarak, our Jebeli guide, led us reverently to the grave of Sheikh Rizzu Abu Ghasim, a stone enclosure with an entrance doorway and the rock-covered grave inside.

S., 50, 1948 and a sprig had been placed by some fond hand at the head and feet of the deceased. 2. About 350 paces east of Mine "M" on the same crest as Serabit el- Khadem, Terry found the upper portion of a stone shaft exposed. Since it was unrecorded by Petrie, excavations were begun by our three Guftis under Phillips and Terry with the hope that this might prove to be an air vent into an undiscovered old mine or a tomb of a distinguished Egyptian who had died there about 1500 B.C. This shaft was cleared to a depth of 14 ft., with surface dimensions 5 X4 ft. The lowest three feet of the shaft consisted of a rounded block of stone through which the ancient Egyptians had laboriously drilled their way. The floor was also solid rock. Near the top, toe-holds had been cut into the roughly squared blocks. What was its purpose? My suggestion is that it served as a storehouse for the valuable stone and copper tools, even possibly for the precious turquoise. The location of this stone vault on a narrow ridge made it easily defensible and yet close to Mines "L" and "M." On the other hand, it may have been a temporary resting place for a prominent figure who'died during an inspection trip. Thirdly, it may have been an engineering failure. CHALCOLITHIC In a rockshelter (abri sous-roche) on the northern side of the Wadi Khraiza, a tributary of the great Wadi Feiran, were found a small hoe23 (or possibly an adze), some scrapers and hammerstones, including a large basalt pounder of the type used by the ancient Egyptian miners on their way to Serabit el- Khadem or to the turquoise mines in the Wadi Muqattab. Trial trenches revealed beneath a thick stalagmitic crust a stratum of charred dbbris con- sisting of gray black vegetable ash mixed with sheep dung and seeds from a local plant, the latter still the normal fodder for sheep. Neither pottery, stone tools nor even flakes came to light. This place must have served as a shelter from the wind and cold from Chalcolithic to recent times. Fresh camel and sheep tracks were imprinted on the sandy approaches. HISTORICAL 1. Five kilometers south of Abu Zenima, just beyond the point where the hills run close to the water, stretches the Plain of Merkhah with the high hills on the left and Abu Rudeis, beside the Gulf of Suez. Here a low mound yielded pottery attributed to the period 1500 B.C. After some trial trenches and a general examination of the area, Albright determined this to be the port used by the ancient Egyptian miners. Since the lowest part of the mound lies only 2 m. above present sea level, this proves conclusively that the Red Sea has not risen24 higher during the past 3400 years. Hence it can now be stated with 23 Cf. Chalcolithic and later "hoes" from El-Obeid and Kish in Iraq. 24 Similar confirmation of the recent stability of the Red Sea level was obtained at Ezion-</page><page sequence="7">FIELD] THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AFRICAN EXPEDITION 485 certainty for the first time that the level of the Gulf of Suez has not risen since 1500 B.C. and, as a corollary, the Red Sea and Great Bitter Lake re- mained unconnected by water. This confirms the increasingly-held view that the route of the Exodus25 crossed the northern Isthmus of Suez. Apparently, Moses led the hosts of Israel eastward to the south of Lake Menzaleh across the "Sea of Reeds" (Hebrew Yam siph), which became impassable for the Pharaoh's heavy chariots. At the right moment an east wind blew (Exod. XIV: 21). The miracle was complete. Later in January we visited San el-Hagar (ancient Tanis) and drove to Tell Ertabeh (ancient Pithom), which lies south of the Ismailia Canal about three kilometers southeast of Qassasin near the modern village of Ezbet Abu Seyyid. Here on low rolling mounds, sherds indicated a Pharonic site. We con- tinued to Tell Maskhuta (ancient Succoth, later Heropolis), which lies across the Ismailia Canal from Abu Kebir and due east of Tell Ertabeh. 2. At Serabit el-Khadem,26 in a small wadi leading from the northern end of the Temple, a collection was made of rolled picks and some scrapers from late predynastic and early dynastic times. These were used by the Egyptian miners of turquoise for a period of several centuries from about 1500 B.C. 3. Near the northern end of Feiran Oasis, 76 kilometers from Abu Zenima, stand the ruins of Pharan,27 referred to during the second century and used as the residence of a bishop about the year 400 A.D. After the conquest of Egypt by Amru, the Muslims chased away the Christians and the city fell into ruins. At the present time the oasis is inhabited by relatively prosperous Beduins, now settled as cultivators in this well-watered, long narrow strip dominated by date palms (Phoenix dactylifera). We climbed on the ruins for two hours and collected a representative series of Byzantine and early Arab potsherds. Across the valley, perched high on a steep summit, was a ruined stone building which local informants considered the remains of a mill (tahuna) of the Beni Israel. INSCRIPTIONS 1. At Serabit el-Khadem28 Albright studied the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions in Mines "L" and "M" and checked the published texts in situ. The stone heaps, referred to by Petrie29 as shelters, proved upon examination to be the graves of miners. The probable reason for no bones being found therein was because turquoise beads were buried with the dead, later to be pilfered. Once Geber, Solomon's seaport, near Aqaba during 1939-1941 by Dr. Nelson Glueck, then Director, American School of Oriental Research, Jerusalem. 25 For a detailed account see Albright, 1948a. See also Shafei, 1946. 26 See Petrie, 1906. According to Ball, 1916, p. 13, the position of Serabit el-Khadem is Lat. 290 2' 14" and Long. 330 27' 28" at an altitude of 735 m. above sea level. 27 See Rabino, 1938, p. 8, from which the historical notes have been excerpted. 28 For this part of the trip we were joined by Dr. Willard Beling, Dr. William H. Brownlee, and Dr. John C. Trever from the American School of Oriental Research, Jerusalem. 9 Petrie, 1906, pp. 172-181,</page><page sequence="8">486 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 50, 1948 a grave has been robbed, an easy entrance may be effected by such animals as hyenas, jackals, foxes and wolves. Thus no bones were found by Petrie beneath these stone heaps, which led him to interpret their use as shelters30 or houses. Moreover, we observed that the majority of these piles of stones stood on exposed high points, often summits, which would never be selected by those desirous of shelter on this wind-swept mountain. On the other hand, the dead have long been buried in cairns on highest points. For these reasons we believe the remains on top of Serabit el-Khadem were the graves of dead miners, not their "shelters." This new interpretation now gave Albright a new light on the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions,31 for, if the miners were buried in these cairns, then the inscriptions were probably memorials to them and, since Merkhah Port could be dated about 1500 B.C., this was then the probable date of the mining operations. Thus, the language of the inscriptions was of a similar date and no earlier, placing it, therefore, as South Canaanite, and thereby making some of the most puzzling characters now decipherable. Hence Al- bright could now make new readings with far more logical interpretations. 2. Some of the well-known Nabatean inscriptions" were photographed in the Wadi Muqattab, Wadi Sidri and Wadi Feiran. These graffiti include a few animals, usually camels, often accompanied by human figures. In the Wadi Feiran the graffito of an ostrich was seen.33 PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY CRANIA 1. In the Wadi Solaf above Feiran Oasis two circular buildings, known as Nawamis,34 were visited. The tomb nearest to the track had an entrance facing 30 "Facing south just below the uppermost level are several rockshelters containing indica- tions of long occupation. These would have made excellent temporary dwellings for the ancient Egyptian miners, although no traces of their pottery were found on the surface nor upon the scree slopes." 31 Cf.

See also Albright, 1948a and 1948b. 32 About 2600 have been published, including these from Petra in Trans-Jordan, but mainly from handwritten copies usually less accurate than photographs unless the copyist can read the texts at sight and thus determine whether certain marks be part of the inscription or fractures in the red sandstone. These vague scratchings represent customarily the ancient form of "Kilroy was here," nothing more significant. At the request of Dr. Etienne Drioton, Directeur-G6nrral du Service des Antiquit6s, five Nabatean inscriptions were removed from isolated localities in the Wadi Feiran and brought by the Expedition to the Cairo Museum, where Hamza Bey will place them on exhibition near the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions. These were the first Nabatean inscriptions to be brought out of Sinai; one has been assigned to the University of California. See also Albright, 1948, Fig. 4. 33 According to Murray, 1935a, p. 125, Burckhardt saw two ostriches in 1816 on the Cairo- Suez road. He seems to have been the last European to see them wild in Egypt. Our Tihi inform- ant, Achmed, at Bir Hassana stated that ostrich tracks had been seen by his grandfather in Sinai.

Since our Beduin guides believed them to be relics of their most ancient ancestors, the Beni Hilal, they volunteered to re- move the capstone. Phillips handed out nineteen crania and calvaria, which were measured, photographed and replaced before resealing the tomb. They were small in capacity, dolichocephalic, often with parietal bosses and rela- tively feeble muscular attachments. Several Wormian bones were recorded as well as one case of a persistent metopic suture. The general impression was that these crania belonged to one of the basic Mediterranean types and could well be the direct ancestors of the modern dwellers in this area of southwestern Sinai. 2. At St. Catherine's Monastery there is an ossuary (45'X20') containing many hundreds of bleached skulls and long bones arranged like cordwood. Unfortunately the racial mixture of these former monks renders them value- less for anthropometric study. The bones of the archbishops are segregated in wooden boxes arranged in tiers. Two skeletons, still bound together by a heavy chain, are those of two Oriental princes, who lived and died as hermits in a nearby cave on Jebel Musa, the traditional Mount Sinai. 3. On the right side of the valley leading away from Pharan were seven small tombs (12'X8'X4')hewn into the living rock; in one were two male skulls (one with a persistent metopic suture) and one right femur-all bleached. Another tomb which had been walled up, possibly undisturbed since closing, was opened. Inside lay a young adult skeleton in a supine position. Another tomb, at a slightly higher level, contained a solitary male skull with worn teeth. The other tombs visited were empty, rifled long ago. ANTHROPOMETRIC DATA ON THE LIVING 1. In order to obtain a sample of the modern inhabitants of Sinai every effort was made to record anthropometrics data on as large a series of non- urban dwellers as possible. The main difficulty lay in the lack of large Beduin encampments and as a result the wide dispersal of the individuals. The Beduins rarely made even the mildest objection.36 SIncluding tribe; age; stature; head length and breadth; minimum frontal diameter; bizygo- matic breadth; bigonial breadth; total facial height; upper facial height; nasal height and breadth; left ear length and breadth; skin color, hair color; form, texture, quality, and quantity; eye color; iris; eyebrow concurrency; brow-ridges; nasal profile, tip and wings; lips; teeth eruption, bite, loss, wear and crowding; and ear lobe, size and protrusion; disease; tattooing; anomalies; and special observations. Frontal and profile photographs were taken. * Selman Ahmed, our guide in the southern area, explained the remarkable co-operation of the Beduins to their belief that Professor Albright, despite his obvious interest in broken pottery, was really searching for the golden hoard which every Beduin knows lies buried in the mountains of Sinai. The clue to the locality is in the possession of one Beduin who dare not reveal it even to his family, but we are "trustworthy foreigners." The head and face measurements of this man are known, hence the anthropometry. As soon as the correct person is found he will give a password</page><page sequence="10">488 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 50, 1948 In the northern region the following tribesmen37 were measured: Tarabin (23), Tiyaha (23), Laheiwat (3), Nekhlawis38 (3), Jebeliya39 (73), Qararshe (29), Sawalha (29), Muzeina (22), Awlad Said (12), Aleiqat (3) and Ferayin (2). The basic and purest element among these Beduins of Sinai is represented by a short, small-headed, dolichocephalic (GOL 200 or +) type with narrow forehead and face, a thin, aquiline nose with curving alae, and a slight, dark brown beard. The hair and eyes are always dark brown. In physique the Beduin of Sinai is small but extremely wiry and capable of great endurance on little food and water. His eyes are remarkably sharp and he possesses an intimate knowledge of all around him. Many are close to the ideal basic Mediterranean type, the true descendant of the Proto-Mediterraneans. Mr. G. W. Murray very kindly granted permission for his measurements of 63 Towara (South Sinai) males to appear as an Appendix in the final report. Thus there are now available40 data on my 223 males and Murray's 63 Towara, making a total of 286 men from the peninsula of Sinai with its esti- mated population of 5000-6000 nomads. 2. Upon arrival on November 19 at the Expedition base camp at Kom Oshim at the eastern entrance to the Faiyum, plans were made to record simi- lar anthropometric data at Tamiya,41 five miles distant. A total of 189 adult males, obtained mainly from the cotton-ginning plant, were measured, observed and photographed.42 Shortly after the work began it became obvious like "Iftah simsim" ("Open Sesame") and upon recognition this Beduin will lead us to the treas- ure. For his services the Beduin will be given handfuls of gold which will enable him "to marry four wives and live happily ever after." There was many a disappointed face when a man was handed a small coin and three cigarettes and wished Godspeed. Selman smiled knowingly when he related this modern folktale which may well become legendary. 7 The spellings follow those adopted by Murray, 1935a. See tribal map, p. 247. 38 Inhabitants of Nekhl. 39 According to Murray (pp. 265-266) the Jebeliya are descendants of Bosnian and Wallach- ian serfs given by Justinian to St. Catherine's Monastery. In-their more delicate and rounded fea- tures they differ from the Beduins of Sinai. They reminded me slightly of the Sulubba (Sleyb) of the North Arabian Desert. See footnote 11. 40 Chantre measured 18 males. For reference see footnote 43. 41 Selected because: (a) its proximity to our camp, generously made available to the Expedi- tion for five months by the Egyptian Government; (b) it contained a representative population of 9000 dwellers in the Faiyum; and (c) Dr. Saleh ed-Din, the medical officer, spoke English and offered to collaborate in any scientific research program. Permission to conduct anthropometric studies had been obtained from the Ministry of Education and the Governor (Mudir) of the Fai- yumr. 42 By William and Gladys Terry. In addition, agricultural development in the Tamiya area was recorded by Charles D. Evans, Marine Corps photographer attached to the Expedition, with the assistance of Fuad Ali, general manager of Daria Tamiya. Accompanied by Lieutenant Salah Habib, he obtained a series of photographs illustrating life in the Faiyum, especially the new de- velopments in agriculture and water purification. The latter has improved public health. For example, in the area served by El-Azab (i.e., southwestern Faiyum) no cholera was reported during the recent epidemic and the incidence of bilharzia has been reduced greatly.</page><page sequence="11">PIELD] THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AFRICAN EXPEDITION 489 that blood-grouping, a nutritional survey, and sociological data were highly desirable in order to form the key study of the Faiyum.A Through the co-opera- tion of Dr. Mohammed M. Sadr of the Biochemistry Department of the School of Medicine, Kasr el-Aini, Cairo, the request for assistance was proposed to Mezni Bey, chief of the Permanent Committee on Nutrition, which is working with the Ministry of Public Health and members of the Faculties of Medicine of Fuad I University, Cairo. Five days later a Mobile Nutritional Unit, with a staff of seven, began work in Tamiya on a program which continued for eight weeks. The results are now being tabulated for the final report, in Arabic and English, which will be completed under the direction of Dr. Sadr. 3. At Fidimin, near the center of the Faiyum and the richest village because of the dates and citrus products, 306 adult males were measured" for compari- son with the Tamiya series. The lighter hair and fairer complexions were noted during the study. 4. Albright, Phillips and I visited San el-Hagar to call on Dr. Pierre Mon- tet, long the excavator of ancient Tanis. He was employing 90 men and 160 women and girls. Although only, minor elements of submerged blondism ap- peared to be present, this sample of the population of northern Sharqiya looked different from the Tamiya and Fidimin samples, although far closer to them than to the true Beduins of Sinai. 5. A brief visit to Aswan Suq in Upper Egypt disclosed a predominance of Negroid blood over Mediterranean admixtures. The fuzzy-haired Bisharin looked remarkably non-Mediterranean. MISCELLANEA45 ASWAN 1. The Museum on Elephantine Island contains material on exhibition46 43 Cf. Ammar, 1944. Data on 1000 adults were obtained. Other recent anthropometric and demographic materials include those by Mitwally 1944, pp. 109-138; and 1946, pp. 289-312. He studied 1082 adult males, aged at least twenty-five, from the following: Siwa (228 out of 1241), Baharia (197 out of 1514), Farafra (52 out of 110), Dakhla (400 out of 3425), and Kharga (205 out of 1903). These supplement the following previous publications: Hrdliaka, 1913; Chantre, 1904; Myers, 1905, 1906, and 1908; W. H., 1909; Craig, 1911, and 1911-1912. For additional references see Ammar, 1944, pp. 415-432. See also comparative tables in Mitwally (1944, pp. 134-137). 44 Full data were recorded on 65 men; on the remainder an abbreviated form was used. Lieu- tenant Hassan el-Magid acted as recorder and organizer. Harley F. Cope, Jr., Photographer's Mate USN Medical Unit attached to the Expedition, photographed 150 men and children on another visit. * A small collection of reptilia, amphibia, insecta, arachnida and mollusca from Sinai and the Faiyum was made. Among shells was a series from Lake Abu Talib, southeastern Faiyum. Dr. F. Haas, Chicago Natural History Museum, identified them as Melanoides (Melanoides) tubercu- lata Muller, Valvata (Cincinna) nilotica Jickeli, and Corbicula (Corbicula) fluminalis consobrina Caillaud. In addition, sand samples were collected to continue my series published by E. C. Dap- ples, 1941". 4 See "Archaeological Survey of Nubia," 1908-1909. The dates and catalog numbers were copied from the labels.</page><page sequence="12">490 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 50, 1948 from as far north as Abu Simbel. Inside the entrance is shown a Ptolemaic Roman ram covered with gold leaf and dedicated to the god Khnum. Among special exhibits are: typical dark red and black Predynastic ware; mirrors, chisels for granite quarrying, fishhooks-all of copper; two ostrich eggs (No. F. 155) bearing incised animals, four quartzite scrapers, one 4" long, from Demhid (No. C-25); a New Empire chessboard of blue glazed faience; a Byzantine (A.D. 1600) large egg-cup-shaped thin pottery vessel with two eyes separated by dark brown bars painted on the upper portion; and an adult male skull (No. 113/41) with a depression on the frontal bone above glabella, the result of a blow from a mace, later healed. 2. Because of our passes from the Department of Antiquities in Cairo, we were shown Lebib Habashy's excavations immediately behind the Museum. A series of rooms has been excavated but several acres remain untouched. Lebib Habashy has found four tombs (5' X3' X3') with carved figures and inscriptions in relief; one figure is painted red with black hair. Two life-size black diorite seated figures of Serumbud and his Queen (twelfth dynasty) stand in recesses. The latter possesses a large mouth and huge protruding ears, but the modeling of the back is delicate. The left foot of the King's statue has two recent breaks. The head of a third statue peers out sadly from a pile of rubble, the next to be excavated. TRIBAL INFORMATION Notes on the number and distribution of the tribes were recorded from several informants in both the northern and southern areas of Sinai. A list of tribal marks47 (sing., wasm) for comparison with my collection from Trans- Jordan, Syria and Iraq, was obtained from many sources. In some sections the location of wells and the quantity and quality of the water were noted. ETHNOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS In Sinai a few specimens were purchased, mainly from the Jebeliya at St. Catherine's Monastery.These included: a leather bag (sufra) with a handle (merirah) and colored tassels (sherashib, sing., shershibah); a red and yellow pouch (dhakirah) with a metal horn (madkhal), buckle (bezim), buttons (be- zair), and a strap (aqisah); two pipes (sing., sibil) and a tobacco pouch (kis); some musical instruments (2 rabayba, 2 simsimiya and 1 reed flute in a metal case); and a circular fishing net called sha'a by the Muzeina, shebakha in the Nile Valley and tarraba at Suez. SUMMARY The reconnaissance survey of the University of California African Expedi- tion worked in Sinai from December 15, 1947 to January 17, 1948. A chain of 47 Cf. Rostem, 1948.</page><page sequence="13">FIELD] THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AFRICAN EXPEDITION 491 surface stations yielding Paleolithic, Neolithic, Mesolithic and historical flint implements was located. Thus our preconceived theory that man in a Paleo- lithic phase of culture migrated across northern Sinai, the Afrasiatic land- bridge, has been established. Furthermore, in southwestern Sinai Stone Age man left traces in at least two of the main wadis.48 In other reports49 further details of other phases of the Expedition have been given. Anthropometric data were obtained on 223 males in Sinai and 495 in the Faiyum. The generous co-operation of the Egyptian Government50 must be recorded; even in these difficult days our scientific researches both in the Faiyum and in Sinai were encouraged and facilitated in every possible manner. We leave Egypt for the Sudan with the fond hope that circumstances will make it possible for us to return to continue these preliminary studies. 2713 DUMBARTON AVENUE, N. W. WASHINGTON 7, D. C.
