<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beware the "Obvious" EUGENE D. WEINBERG DEAN FRASER THE HUMAN ENTERPRISE of science consists of several components, of which the initial one is usually the observation of natural phenomena. Persons who make such observations often feel the need to classify and interpret their observations. But though we like to think of science as a free and unfettered search for the truth, it is intriguing to note the extent to which each of the steps of the scientific process reflects current at- titudes and biases of scientists and their contemporaries. Comparisons may be facile but false; interpretations often reflect current fads. For science does have its fads. Those of us who have been around for awhile can easily remember that the conquest of disease, for example, which was once thought to lie in witch doctors or faith, supposedly achieved the scientific final answer first with immunizations, then antibiotics, then vitamins and minerals. At the moment, we seem determined to solve all of our problems with prostaglandins, which are claimed to cure everything from dandruff to cancer. A consequence of this dependency.on mental sets is the reward that often awaits the scientist-most fre- quently the neophyte unburdened with cant and dogma-who rejects the "obvious" and "accepted" and who notes that the facile explanation really glosses over difficulties or explains the facts inadequately. Nevertheless, it is astonishing how often facts have been bent to fit explanations instead of the reverse. D. Ivanovsky is usually credited with being the dis- coverer of viruses. He set about identifying the infec- tious agent of tobacco mosaic disease with the pre- conceived idea that it must be a bacterium. In that dec- ade, the last of the nineteenth century, the majority of the bacterial agents of disease were being discovered; since tobacco mosaic disease is "transmissible," it was "obviously" bacterial in origin. But Ivanovsky ob- served that the infectious juice contained no bacterial cells that could be detected with his microscope. More- over, his attempts to cultivate the bacteria in the usual laboratory media failed. Finally, the juice retained its infectivity even after passage through a filter that was designed to remove bacteria. In the face of these obser- vations, did Ivanovsky abandon his preconceptions? Not at all. Instead, he seemed only to feel that his ex- perimental results were curious. It is well known to scientists that nature is similar to an onion peeled away layer by layer; even the most satisfying of explanations often merely conceals a more fundamental layer of theory. Thus, when science is working at its best, each theory falls to more subtle in- terpretation. The cell as the unit of life became at least partially understandable in terms of the molecules that make up the cell. Molecules require an understanding of atoms, which in turn led to the idea of nucleus and electrons; the nucleus required protons and neutrons, and study of these particles revealed a bewildering com- plex of additional particles and interactions. Matters are now so complex that surely we are ready for another great simplification. An explanation that is "obvious" may conceal a fur- ther level of truth, but it may also lead to a blind alley. It can be a statement so wrong that discovery of the truth requires backtracking and rejection of the "ob- vious," not because the explanation was too simple but because it was 180? wrong- or at least 180? removed from different explanations advanced later. Every branch of science can provide such examples of ac- cepted "facts" and "theories" that challenge the scien- Eugene D.

No matter how straightforward and satisfactory it may be, an explanation can be completely wrong rather than merely insufficiently subtle. We would like to remark on a very few such examples and have listed them in Table 1. The first two examples are included for readers inter- ested in cosmology, the third is an illustration from chemistry, and the remaining seven are well-known examples from biomedical fields. We include below brief narratives concerning four of the seven; we have purposely omitted narratives for the last three with the hope that students might be encouraged to write these. We hope that this paper will stimulate compilation of additional examples by teachers and students alike. The Master Molecule: Protein or Nucleic Acid? The idea that the essence of life is protein and that nucleic acid is merely incidental arose from interpreta- tions considered "obvious" by scientists in the 1930's. The early work in what is now called molecular biology emphasized the importance of proteins in biochemical events of all kinds. Even the term 'protein' denotes the idea that this substance is of prime importance in living matter. Indeed, as polymers composed of some twenty amino acids in groups of 100 or more, the proteins seemed clearly to be the only molecules of sufficient potential complexity-in terms of possible permutations of structure-to account for the bewildering variety of life in all of its forms and in all of the incredible ramifi- cations of biochemistry. The nucleic acids, on the other hand, consisted of a simple sugar-phosphate backbone with only four nitro- genous bases attached; it was "obvious" that they could not be very complex. In fact an early theory held that nucleic acids are composed of monotonous repeating tetranucleotides; thus they could no more be capable of structural complexity than starch or rubber or ordinary commercial plastic. Therefore, in the 1930's biochemists began to concern themselves with the problem of how proteins reproduce-as "obviously" they must. Among various systems studied, the virus system finally provided the key to this error. Even here, how- ever, the first virus purified was initially declared by Wendell Stanley to be a protein-a mistake attributable to the scant content of ribonucleic acid in tobacco mosaic virus and the crudity of the analytic techniques then available. But when the mistake was discovered and virologists began to refer to viruses as "nucleo- proteins," few regarded the nucleic acid as of any real importance. Most considered it to be just a prosthetic group of some kind; perhaps it was necessary to the BEWARE THE "OBVIOUS" 467</page><page sequence="3">virus but only in the same way that heme is necessary for the function of hemoglobin. With the purification by Oswald Avery of the de- oxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that is the transforming principle in pneumococci and, particularly, the demon- stration by A. D. Hershey that the DNA of T2 bacterio- phage is the only part of the virus needed for its repro- duction, we were confronted with the fact that the nucleic acids must be as complex as proteins even in the face of "obvious" evidence to the contrary. George Gamow, an amateur cryptographer as well as a cosmo- gonist, perceived that we were confronted with a "code" in which triplets of nucleic acid bases each must correspond to a single amino acid in protein the same way that groups of simple dots and dashes can express the complexity of language. While seemingly highly unlikely, this idea proved to be the key to our under- standing of the facts that proteins are not self-repro- ducing, that the "obviously simple" nucleic acids are of equal complexity and are the repository of genetic information and hence responsible for all protein struc- tures of all living matter. The protein of the virus, far less than being its essence, is important only in protect- ing the nucleic acid and introducing it to the host cell. Once inside the cell, the nucleic acid directs the repro- duction of itself and the production of viral protein. Phage Attachment: Heads or Tails? Another excellent example of an interpretation that made "obvious good sense" concerns specifically bac- terial viruses. With the development of the electron microscope in the mid-1930's, it became possible to visualize viruses. The bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria) were intriguing because many consist-grossly of a "head" and a "tail." They are usually described as "tadpole shaped" or "spermlike." Under proper conditions, they attack the host bacterial cell with great speed. Early electron micrographs, some published in Life magazine, indeed showed the tadpole-like phages with their heads up against a host cell and their tails streaming away from the cell. Nothing could have been more obvious than the conclusion that the tadpole- like virus swims to the cell and then gnaws its way in. After several years of belief in the obvious, a new electron microscopic technique was developed by Thomas Anderson, then at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, that avoided certain effects of surface tension in'electron microscope specimen preparation. One of his first discoveries with this method was that the viruses attack the host cell tail first. Robley Wil- liams and one of us (Dean Fraser), seeing this as mani- fest nonsense and against all reason, used a technique that Williams was then developing that was quite dif- ferent but that also avoided the surface tension effects. To our dismay, Anderson was exactly right-the "head" of the virus was the "tail" so far as attachment to the cell is concerned. At about the same time, Frank Putnam, now at Indiana University, then of the Uni- versity of Chicago, showed by careful physical measure- ment that these viruses do not use their tails for swim- ming at all. They instead encounter the host cell just by random wandering and collision, which on a near mole- cular scale can be a quite rapid process. Thus the "tail" of the virus is not an organ of locomotion. Indeed, Williams and Fraser observed that the tail has a hole down the middle; subsequently, A.D. Hershey, of the Cold Spring Harbor Institute for Quantitative Biology, showed that the essential part of the virus is its DNA, that the head is merely a repository for this material and that the tail is a tube through which the DNA is "injected" into the cell. With these latter discoveries, scientists immediately comforted themselves with another anthropomorphic interpretation-that the virus should be placed in an- alogy not with the tadpole but with the hypodermic syringe. This belief is now firmly entrenched in scien- tific lore. Since we still do not know, really, how the injection occurs, one wonders whether we are again misleading ourselves with a facile "explanation." An Experiment of Nature: Hyper- or Hypo-Gammaglobulinemia? The history of medical discoveries abounds with in- stances in which the first clue is that of a chance obser- vation of an "experiment of nature." For example, in the eighteenth century, Edward Jenner was interviewing a peasant woman on an unrelated matter when by chance the subject of smallpox arose. She remarked "I cannot take (contract) smallpox because I have had cowpox." Thus, Jenner learned of an "experiment of nature" from a random conversation; he then pro- ceeded to develop the cowpox vaccine and so founded the discipline of clinical immunology. In the 1890's, a group of molecules was discovered that accumulate in the blood plasma of individuals who have recently had an infectious disease or who have been immunized with a vaccine. By the 1940's, these molecules (called antibodies) had been characterized as members of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood plasma proteins. Disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and toxins contain antigens that stimulate the body to pro- duce disease-resisting antibodies. That humans and other animal hosts possess a great capacity to manu- facture a diversity of gamma globulin molecules was apparent. However, the total quantity of gamma glo- bulin that could be formed by a single individual was not known. In 1951, the young son of a major-general began to have a series of severe bacterial infections. In earlier times, such a child would soon have died, but by the early 1950's a sufficient variety of antibacterial anti- (Concluded on p. 480) 468 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, NOVEMBER 1976</page><page sequence="4">Beware the "Obvious ". . . from p. 468 biotics had become available; thus the child was kept alive. The U.S. Army pediatrician, Ogden Bruton, who attended the patient, mentioned to a visiting colleague that the child was experiencing his nineteenth serious bacterial infectious episode. "Obviously," the colleague remarked, "after all this exposure to bacterial antigens the patient must now have tremendous levels of anti- body, far more antibody molecules in his plasma than do normal children." Since the Walter Reed Army Hos- pital laboratory had just acquired an instrument to mea- sure antibody quantity, why not send a sample of the child's plasma to the lab? This was done, but the instru- ment could detect no antibody. The laboratory person- nel first blamed the machine, not the "obvious" predic- tion of the visiting physician. But subsequent specimens confirmed that the instrument performed properly; indeed, the child lacked the ability to form gamma glo- bulin. The patient, an "experiment of nature," was then in- jected on a regular basis with gamma globulin and has survived into adulthood. The impetus of the correct, rather than the "obvious," explanation of the child's disease has resulted in the discovery of many kinds of defects of the immune defense system. Rational treat- ment modalities are now being devised for these dis- eases. Iron: Friend or Foe? That plants and animals require specific metallic ele- ments in their diets is a fact that has been perceived largely within the past few decades. However, one such element, iron, was known as early as the seventeenth century to be essential to human and animal life. Thus, in 1932 when A. Locke in Chicago discovered that serum iron levels decline in persons with infections, physicians assumed that the decline "obviously" was detrimental to the patient's health. Additional iron was fed to patients, but this procedure did not affect the outcome of the infections. By the 1940's, it had become apparent that assimila- tion of iron from the intestine into the blood stream is halted by infected patients. Physicians did not despair; they simply began to inject iron into the patients intra- muscularly. But again the procedure was of no help; indeed, in some instances the illness was made worse. Fortunately, antibiotics became available in the late 1940's and early 1950's so that misguided attempts to counteract the hypoferremia of infection by injecting iron were largely abandoned. Apparently, hematologists and internists failed to even consider the possibility that the invaded host might be attempting to withhold growth-essential iron from the pathogenic bacteria. In fact, even most bacteriolo- gists in the 1940's were unaware that bacteria need as much iron for growth as do cells of animals and plants. Ironically, Arthur Schade and Leona Caroline, then at Wallerstein Laboratories in New York City, discovered in 1943 powerful antibacterial iron-binding proteins in serum and in egg white, but evidence that the materials benefit hosts by withholding iron from bacterial in- vaders was neither sought nor obtained. Finally, twenty years later, the logical experiments of observing the course of bacterial infections in animals that were made either hypoferremic or hyperferremic were performed in a dozen different laboratories. The results were astounding: a small surplus of serum iron strongly aids the bacterial infection rather than the host; a small deficit of serum iron greatly aids the host rather than the bacterial pathogens. It immediately became "obvious" why persons who are hyperferremic for various reasons suffer far more bacterial infections than do normal people and why infected persons strive desperately to withhold iron from bacterial invaders. But even as late as 1975, physicians were describing in published articles their rediscovery of the fact that rou- tine injection of iron into normal persons increases the incidence of bacterial infection. Clearly, it is not easy for humans to understand that an old friend actually may, under some circumstances, be a foe. We have cited in detail only a very few examples from our own fairly direct experience and offer in suggestion a few more of well-known historical importance. Pro- gress in science comes most spectacularly from those who are dissatisfied with accepted facts and explana- tions and who are willing to question them no matter how well-established and "obviously correct" they may be. Most often the subsequent step in progress comes from facing facts and unpeeling the next layer in sub- tlety. But, as we hope to have shown, one should not be afraid to question whether even the opposite of an ac- cepted explanation may not better explain awkward facts. We hope that readers will supply other examples from their own experience and encourage students to examine critically and maintain a questioning attitude as they learn the "facts" of science. 480 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, NOVEMBER 1976 REFERENCES ANDERSON, T.
