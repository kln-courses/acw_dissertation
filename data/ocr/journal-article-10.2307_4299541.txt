<plain_text><page sequence="1">43 EXCAVATIONS AT TALL-I-NOKHODI By Clare Goff Dotted about the Pasargadae plain, between the more famous monuments of the Achaemenian city, are the remains of a number of small Chalcolithic mounds dating back to the latter half of the fourth millennium s.c. These mounds first attracted attention in 1934 when Sir Aurel Stein, in the course of an archaeological tour of Fars, undertook a two-day sounding at a site called Doh-Tulan A as well as examining another mound called Tall-i-Seh-Asiab.' As a result of his investigations it became apparent that the Pasargadae region possessed a uniform Chalcolithic sequence, characterized first by painted pottery and secondly by red burnished pottery.2 Further work on these early cultures at Pasargadae had to wait until 1951. In that year Mr. Ali-Sami, working on behalf of the Iranian Archaeological Department, began a series of soundings at two fresh sites: Tall-i-Khari, which lies immediately to the north-east of the Achaemenian Sacred Precinct, and Tall-i-Nokhodi, which lies further south, about 8oo00 m. north-west of the Tomb of Cyrus, on the edge of a small water-course that debouches into the River Pulvar.3 Describing his excavations at these last two sites Mr. Sami has written as follows:4 " We worked for a few weeks on two prehistoric tepes known as Tall-i-Nokhodi and Tall-i-Khari-i-Abu'l-Wardi which were close to the villages of Abu'l Wardi and Mobarrakabad. These tepes were not very high, nor were they extensive. Unfortunately we found neither complete nor semi-complete vessels, only broken pot sherds which were characterized by the same forms, designs and colours as the pottery of Tall-i-Bakun. These sherds were at a depth of i m. 30 cm. They had stylized and attractive designs of animals, flowers and geometric patterns in light and dark brown, dark green and black. The discovery of these sherds proves that the plain of Pasargadae was settled in prehistoric times by tribal groupings, whose artistry and craftsmanship bore a close resemblance to the work of other cultures in the same century, and progressed alongside them." Present Excavations During the course of last year's excavations at Pasargadae, conducted under the auspices of the British Institute of Persian Studies, it was felt that the opportunity should be taken to give closer definition to the architecture, pottery and stratigraphy of such sites. Accordingly it was decided that the most profitable work might be undertaken at Tall-i-Nokhodi, where the depth of both the red ware and painted pottery was known to be considerable and where ash layers promised a chance of obtaining carbon samples for dating. The work at the site was carried out between November i oth and December i6th 1961, under the joint direction of Mr. David Stronach and the writer. Miss Elisabeth Beazley joined in the work of surveying the site, while Mrs. M. E. Weaver assisted with the pottery and Miss Olive Kitson had charge of the photography. Description of the Site Tall-i-Nokhodi is a small mound, 120 m. long and 8o m. wide, its limits being roughly defined by a modern irrigation ditch. It is somewhat saucer-shaped with a slight depression in the centre, and at its highest point rises only a little over 2 m. above the level of the surrounding plain. x A. Stein, Iraq III, part 2, p. 218 f. 2 An almost identical pottery sequence was discovered a few years earlier at the mound of Tall-i-Bakun A, 2 km. south of Persepolis. The results of the Bakun excavations were published in great detail in 1942, but unfortunately the evidence failed to reveal the precise nature of the transition between the painted ware and the red ware. See D. McCown and A. Langsdorff Tall-i-Bakun A, Season of 1932, p. 32-3. (Hereafter this publication is referred to as Bakun.) 3A map showing both Tall-i-Nokhodi and Tall-i-Khari appears at Fig. 2. in Mr. David Stronach's article describing the Pasargadae excavations. 4 Ali-Sami, Archaeological Reports IV, 1960, p. 36.

Besides the obvious advantage of being able to see, in advance, the position of floor levels in section, the remains of walls and ovens within the abandoned trench led us to hope that the area was the centre of a redware building complex. Accordingly two trenches A and B, each 4 by 5 m. in size, were sunk i m. to the east of the Department's trench, close to the middle of the central depression (Fig. i). In addition, a small sounding that the Department had made to the west of the main trench was named C and extended for II m. to the north, in order to ascertain the limits of a small room containing an unusual type of oven, previously only partially excavated. Trench C was not dug below level II. The two main trenches, however, were carried down to virgin soil, which was reached about 4 m. below the highest point of the mound, giving a total depth of deposit in the trenches themselves ofjust under 3 m. Within this deposit we were able to distinguish four main building levels. The first two, together occupying about i m., produced red slipped and grey pottery related to that already known from Tall-i-Bakun A V. The remaining two levels produced buff and painted wares of the type known from Tall-i-Bakun A I-IV. Levels I and II In trenches A and B these levels appeared to consist of four successive courtyard deposits. Three of these, in level I, were marked only by a few scattered hearths, mere circular patches of pebbles, and the remains of a more elaborate plastered oven on the western edge of trench A. This oven backed on to a wall within the baulk, and directly behind this wall, a second similar oven had been left in place by the previous excavators. A child's skeleton had been sunk into the Ib floor of the B trench, either from the Ia floor above, or from some later period of occupation. In the north of trench A, a small bowl-shaped pit, 50 cm. wide and 32 cm. deep, had been sunk from the floor of Ic. It was provided with a coarse pottery lining and the interior was painted bright red. In level II, the remains of a pis6 wall protruded from the western baulk of trenches A and B. It stood on a foundation of large river pebbles. A thick layer of similar pebbles covered most of the floor of trench B. This layer produces a great deal of rather coarse red pottery, including one complete small jar as well as fragments of the conical base of a buff ware bowl (Fig. 14: 16) and a painted bowl with a ring base (Fig. 9: 3). A second complete red ware jar together with a miniature painted one (Fig. 12: 27) were found directly beside the wall in trench A. These large buff ware pottery fragments are important as an indication that the Bakun A I-IV pottery tradition continued for a short time at any rate into the later period. Better evidence as to the character of the red ware culture came from trench C. The extension to the north revealed two intermediate floors in level I, both associated with two well-preserved circular ovens. The westernmost one (Fig. 2) was i m. in diameter across the interior which was filled with a thick layer of powdery grey ash above one of very small pebbles. It was surrounded by a wall of hard clay io cm. thick, elaborately plastered on the interior and protected on the south by a block of pis6. In level II we found the western end of a small room, 4 m. 8o cm. across. The west wall stepped out to accommodate a large oven which backed against it (Fig. 3). This oven was of the same plastered type as that previously discovered in trench A, but being on a lower level was far better preserved. It consisted of a plastered platform, roughly 85 cm. square, with a plastered channel 30 cm. wide to the north. A plastered step, also 30 cm. wide, ran along the whole of the front of the oven and was continued to the north by a carefully plastered " horn ". The oven was backed by a wall from which two low arms projected to enclose its northern and southern sides. A flue ran diagonally through the wall to the passage outside. A large block of masonry, which had fallen in a solid mass from one of the walls into the centre of the room, enabled us to obtain both brick sizes and an idea of the method of bonding. The bricks were roughly 45 cm. square, although sides could vary from 48 to 43 cm. The bricks themselves were set in a form of thick mud mortar.</page><page sequence="5">EXCAVATIONS AT TALL-I-NOKHODI 47 Levels III and IV These two building levels can be further subdivided into five floor levels, IIIa and b, and IVa, b and c. Plans of levels III and IVc appear in Fig. 4. In trench A, a small house built at the beginning of level IV was subsequently rebuilt to a different plan in level III. Not only were the walls of these III and IV structures built on a different alignment to those of the two higher levels but their bricks were far softer and harder to identify. The main wall in level IV had a thick coat of painted red plaster running along the greater part of its south face, while both it, and the level III walls above it, stood on stone foundations.

The type was already known from a single example at Tall-i- Bakun A, level III.5 We found six and the corner of a possible seventh. Three of these ovens, those from levels IIIb, IVa and IVb, were built directly one above the other (Section, Fig. 5). Thus, despite the change of plan in trench A there can have been no real break between levels III and IV. A further slight change occurred in level IVc, when no less than three ovens were discovered within the two trenches, with traces of a fourth in the extreme south-west corner of trench A. Trench B had two floors in this level, both composed of small, closely packed pebbles.

Section of west face of Trench B. (Hatched areas represent mud-brick walling). Other discoveries from these two levels consisted of a complete storage jar sunk into the corner of the house in IIIb, and a complete ring-based bowl (Fig. 9: 1) from the floor in IVa. Numerous other large fragments, including most of the jar illustrated in Fig. 13: 1, came from a midden in trench A, to the north of the IVa oven. A second nearly complete jar (Fig. 13" 3) was found scattered in frag- ments all over the floor in trench A, together with human and animal figurines. The Plastered Ovens The best preserved oven was that in IVa (Fig. 6). It was oval in plan with slightly flattened sides, measuring I m. 8o cm. in width and 2 m. 20o cm. in length. It consisted of a large, flat baking plate which sloped slightly towards the front, composed of two layers of very hard, very smooth, blackish plaster, each 15 to 20 mm. thick. To the south was an unplastered ash-box, 50 cm. wide, and about 2o cm. deep. On either side of the oven were mud-brick walls which, on Tall-i-Bakun analogies, should have provided support for a domed roof. The walls were lined with a thick layer of orange plaster which curved gently down to join the plaster of the baking-plate. A carefully plastered " pot stand " was attached to the north wall. The entrance was in front of the ash pit. While the IIIb and IVb ovens were very similar, the main oven in IVc was perhaps the most carefully constructed of all. It was completely elliptical with very evenly curved sides. To the south was a beautifully plastered channel, which doubtless served as an ash box. The whole oven was surrounded by the remains of an enclosing mud-brick wall, plastered on the interior. The entrance was presumably at the eastern end of the ash box, within the baulk. Only a small area of grey plaster and part of a low supporting wall testify to the existence of a second oven in trench B. The third oven in trench A, was the largest found, being 3 m. 6o cm. long. It had traces of the same orange plaster around its edge and a possible ash pit to the north.</page><page sequence="7">ISOMETRIC RECONSTRUCTION OVEN 4A 0 1 1 , ,M Fig. 6. Reconstruction of Level IVa oven from Trench B. Fig. 7. Small objects from Tall-i-Nokhodi, including one button seal from Dehbid (No. 4).</page><page sequence="8">50 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Small Objects Of the small finds from levels I and II the most interesting are a copper pin (Fig. 7: 6), which came from the fallen masonry in C I, and a coplper knife (Fig. 7: 7), discovered in the second stratum while cleaning the north face of the Department's main sounding. Both are unusually developed forms for the Uruk period, to which the red ware seems to belong. Unriveted knives or razors with a single cutting edge are unknown elsewhere before the third millennium. Probably the nearest parallel to the knife comes from Anau III," while pins of a somewhat similar type occur in Susa Cb.7 As C II also produced a small ring of copper wire, and a well-preserved copper dagger came from just below the top stratum of Bakun A,8 it is now clear that metal objects were far from uncommon in Iran at this period. Artifacts of other materials from the upper levels were poor in quality, presumably because they came mainly from courtyard deposits rather than the interior of a house. Chert blades, common in the two lower levels, were rare above. Other objects included small sub-rectangular grinding stones, part of a circular granite mace head;9 an oblong pounder of green stone and another of coarse red ware pottery. An oblong scraper or polisher (Fig. I2: 28) cut from a piece of painted buff ware resembles similar finds from Tall-i-Bakun.x0 The only button seal found in the course of the excavations came from CII (Fig. 7: 5). It was made of unbaked clay, provided with pierced projection at the back and decorated with incised cross-hatching. Both the use of clay as opposed to stone and the use of cross-hatching as opposed to radial designs, are typical of buttons dating from Bakun A IV or later." Thus it seems likely that both traits are characteristic of the incoming red ware culture. A button seal of the more typical early Bakun A type was picked up at the mound of Dehbid, 45 km. further to the north (Fig. 7: 4). Mother of pearl shells indicate possible contact with the Persian Gulf. Neither metal objects nor button seals were found in levels III and IV. On the other hand there was a great increase in the number of worked blades. With the exception of one tiny fragment of obsidian, chert was the only stone used. Most chert blades were I-2 cm. wide and up to 6 or 7 cm. long (Fig. 7: 1). The ends were either simply broken off or more carefully rounded. One, or sometimes both sides showed subsidiary working and several had a very high silicacious polish indicating use as sickle blades. One rather broader blade had a carefully serrated edge while two others probably served as awls (Fig. 7: 2, 3). Bone instruments, rare at Bakun, were not encountered in the limited area under excavation. Two spindle whorls were discovered, one bi-conoid and the other octagonal in section with a slightly scalloped edge.12 Both were of unpainted clay. Pegs (Fig. 12: 29-32) and circular discs (Fig. I2: 33-34) cut from fragments of painted pottery may have been used as gaming counters.'3 Animal and human figurines were well represented. Two of the animals were recognizable Bakun varieties.'4 One (Fig. 7: 14) of unbaked clay, probably represented a sheep, the other, of slipped and baked clay (Fig. 7: 13) some sort of ox. Fig. 7: 12 possibly represents a mountain goat with all four legs bunched together on the summit of a rock. The amazingly naturalistic bear's head (Fig. 7: I 1) is in complete contrast to such crude stylized forms, and in fact to most animal figurines of the Chalcolithic period in Iran. The same contrast between decorative abstractions and attempts at representation occurs in the animal designs on the pottery. Human figurines, as at Bakun, were always of baked clay, slipped and painted. Both flat, stylized forms with wing-like arms (Fig. 7: 8) and more naturalistically rounded figures (Fig. 7: IO) were produced. The former resemble examples from the' Ubaid levels at Ur and Arpachiya. is 6 R. Pumpelly, Explorations in Turkestan, Expedition of 1904 I, 1908, p. 153, fig. 273. 7 L.

Not only was a very small area dug but not very many whole pots or even complete profiles were found within it. It is difficult, especially in the two lower levels, to assign many of the rim sherds to a particular base, although an attempt has been made to do this from analogies with Tall-i-Bakun. The fact that many shapes and designs common at Bakun are not represented at Tall-i-Nokhodi may be simply fortuitous. For instance, were we to rely on the sounding of I 961 alone, we would think that a very common type of Bakun design composed of anthropomorphic figures (Type XVIIIB)16 was not represented at all at Nokhodi. The Department, however, had already found a complete bowl of this type in the course of their excava- tions.17 Greater reliance can perhaps be put on our findings when they provide examples of types unknown, or practically unknown at Bakun. Finally the same laws of chance may perhaps apply to our own sounding. Within the small area dug, level IV, and particularly the midden in level IVa, provided the majority of the best sherds and complete pots. Thus again it may simply be a matter of chance that one or two varieties of shape or design, very common in the lowest levels, are rare or absent in level III. The main impression which the pottery gives is undoubtedly one of continuity within the two main cultural periods. Types of Ware from Levels I and II By far the commonest type of pottery in these levels is a hand-made " red ware ",. The paste is grit tempered, usually rather coarse and often crumbly, though better quality sherds with a hard, close-textured core, do exist in small numbers. The colour of the core varies from pink, in the better quality wares, through a dirty buff to greyish-buff or brown. Pots of this type are invariably slipped or washed. The commonest colour is brick red, but yellow ochre, pinkish and brownish shades also occur fairly frequently, particularly the first. Variations of colour often appear on the same pot owing to uneven firing. The slip is sometimes thick, but more often thin and rather streaky as if painted on with a large brush. The great majority of the sherds are unburnished, but a few have a very fine burnish indeed, the slip in such cases being a bright apricot. Red wares occur in all the main shapes listed below. A second class of pottery is yellowish to blackish-grey. The paste is usually coarse, and the tempering of black or white grits easily visible. The surface is smoothed rather than slipped. It appears to have been used only for the manufacture of some of the large jars and, surprisingly, for two miniature pots (Fig. 8: 37, 38). Certain thinner sherds of this ware have been burnished until they are almost black. They invariably come from straight-sided bowls or small hole-mouthed jars with a simple rim. In addition there is a considerable amount of coarse ware, unslipped and mottled buff, pink or black. It is confined, as might be expected, to the simplest shapes-straight-sided, bag-shaped or hole- mouthed bowls and large jars. Pottery Shapes from Levels I and II i. Straight-sided bowls. These usually have the simplest of profiles and occur in black or coarse wares (Fig. 8: I). Less common forms are illustrated in Fig. 8, Nos. 2 and 3. 2. Bowls with everted rims. These seem to be the finer red ware variants of Type I. Both almost straight-sided (Fig. 8: 4, 5), and more " S "-shaped profiles (Fig. 8: 6-9) seem to occur. 3. Hemispherical bowls. These have simple (Fig. 8: Io) or more rarely club-shaped (Fig. 8: I i) rims, and are usually burnished, whereas purely bag-shaped bowls (Fig. 8: 12) are uncommon and appear to be the coarse ware equivalent. 4. Shallow bowls with inverted rims (Fig. 8: I3). 16 Bakun, pp. 49-50. Henceforward Bakun " types " are referred 1s One or two sherds show possible tournette marks, e.g. fig. 8: to without footnotes. 4, 28. " For an illustration of the bowl see A. Sami, op. cit., p. i8i.</page><page sequence="10">52 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES 5. Bowls with " carinated rims " are uncertainly represented by one unstratified sherd (Fig. 8: 14). 6. Carinated bowls (Fig. 8: 15-23). These represent one of the commonest types on the site. The bowls vary somewhat in size and depth but are almost invariably of slipped red ware and in some cases are beautifully burnished. 7. Carinated jars (Fig. 8: 30). These are less common, but again are always red slipped and sometimes burnished. 8. Hole mouthed jars. These vary from rather coarse, heavy pots with simple rims (Fig. 8: 29) to fine globular jars with everted rims (Fig. 8: 24-28) often slipped and burnished. 9, Large jars. These occur in red, grey and coarse wares. The shapes can only be guessed at from rim fragments. Some (Fig. 8: 32) seem to be heavier versions of Type 8. Others (Fig. 8: 33) have short vertical necks. The most common examples (Fig. 8: 34) have short, slightly out- turned necks above narrow, flask-like, or more globular bodies. Miscellania: Pedestals occur in either hollow (Fig. 8: 36) or solid (Fig. 8: 35) forms. Fragments were also found of simple red ware handles, circular in section. Ribbing (Fig. 8: 25), sometimes combined with incision, occasionally occurs on the widest part of a jar. Ring bases (Fig. 8: 31) are fairly common. Fig. 8, Nos. 37 and 38 illustrate two miniature pots. Exterior Connections of the Red Wares The most obvious parallel for the red ware of Tall-i-Nokhodi is that of Bakun A V. Most of our main shapes, including types I,19 2,20 321 (with club-shaped rim), 422 and 8,23 occur further south. Pedestals and ring bases also occur at Bakun though in rather different forms. Two striking differences do however exist. One is the coarser quality of most of the Nokhodi pottery as compared with that from Bakun. The other is the absence, at Bakun, of carinated bowls and jars.24 A possible explanation of this might be that the red ware came into Fars from the North25 and that it reached the more southerly sites in a more developed form. This might account both for its improved quality and for the lapse of certain shapes, although it would make levels III and IV at Nokhodi contemporary with Bakun A I and 2 as opposed to 3 and 4. The alternative solution would be to regard the Nokhodi pottery simply as a coarser local variation. In a wider context, the pottery of both Tall-i-Nokhodi I and II and Tall-i-Bakun A V at once invites comparison with wares of the Uruk period from Mesopotamia. Not only do red, grey and a few black polished wares occur together but certain shapes also seem to be common to both areas. These include bowls of type 126 and type 227 (particularly Fig. 8: 8); hemispherical bowls with simple rims;28 bowls with carinated rims;29 and hole-mouthed jars with plain, slightly everted and flaring rims30 (these last being better represented at Bakun).31 At Nineveh III, bowls with clubbed rims occur in grey ware;32 grey ware bowls of types 4 and 5 occur at Warka; 33 and at Grai Resh carinated bowls, albeit with clubbed rather than simple rims, also occur.34 Flat bases and ring bases are found in both areas. But although the quality of the Bakun A V red wares seems in part to resemble that of the Uruk wares, the Iranian pottery is hand rather than wheel made, and the Nokhodi grey and black wares are unslipped. Pedestals, found at both Fars sites, do not seem to occur in Mesopotamia, whereas they are known in Iran from Sialk III and Hissar I and II. The solid pedestal of Fig. 8: 34 seems to 19 Bakun, pl. 20: 1, 3. 20 Ibid., pl. 20: 6, 9. x21 Ibid., pl. 20: 17. 22 Ibid., pl. 2o: io. 23 Ibid., pl. 2o: 8, I1. 24 A single carinated form is illustrated in Bakun, pl. 21: 12. 26 Slight evidence for this supposition is provided by the site of Qasr-i-Bahram, Dehbid, about 55 km. north of Pasargadae. Here it is possible to distinguish several metres of red ware deposit in contrast to the single metre at Pasargadae, and the single level at Bakun A. Cf. also A. Stein, op. cit., pp. 213-17. 26 S.

The profiles of the upper part of some of the Hissar Ic and IIa pedestal bowls and of the carinated jars from Sialk III 7 often resemble Nokhodi forms.37 Buff Wares from Levels II, III and IV The majority of at any rate the finer buff wares from these levels seem to have been made with the aid of a tournette. In addition certain sherds, for example Fig. 9: 4; Fig. i o: 4; Fig. i i: 6; Fig. I4: 14, 15, seem to have come from vessels made on a fast wheel, since they show very pronounced and closely spaced horizontal markings. Judgment may have to be reserved on this point however, since the excavators at Tall-i-Bakun observed the same wheel-like marks on small sherds but discounted them on the evidence of their more complete vessels.38 The clay is usually well mixed, fine, and fairly hard. The most usual colour for the core is pale buff or cream, but differences in firing produce variations from a red or yellowish orange to a pale green. As might be expected the red or orange wares are mostly typical of the heavier, unpainted bowls and jars, whereas the green, over-fired pottery is usually confined to the finer sherds. Most of the finer wares and some of the heavier ones have a thin slip of practically the same colour as the core on at least the outer edge of the paste. Otherwise the surface is wet smoothed. Large pots sometimes show signs of scraping. A two-colour effect is sometimes created on the heavier sherds by uneven firing, the core being reddish and the surface creamy. Some of the heavier, more lightly fired bowls have a " floury " feel to them. Other finer sherds occasionally have a slightly spongy surface. A few body sherds show faint parallel grooving and ribbing on the surface, a phenomenon also occurring at Bakun and in the 'Ubaid wares of South Mesopotamia.39 The paint is matt and basically brown in colour, but can vary, according to the intensity of firing, from crimson through reddish or purplish brown to black, and on over-fired pots it is often dirty green. On these last it has often eaten into the surface of the pot and vitrified where thick, as is also the case at Susa A and Bakun. In certain other cases it has a smudgy appearance as if it had been applied when the surface of the pot was still damp and had " run ". Where it is reddish or purplish-brown it is often flaky and impermanent. The decoration is always monochrome. Buf Ware Shapes from Levels II, III and IV The shapes of the buff ware vessels from Tall-i-Nokhodi are closely related to those of Tall-i-Bakun. Ring-based bowls40 are very common. Conical bowls,41, beakers, 42 cups43 and globular jars" with a low carination are also well attested. On the other hand, certain other Bakun shapes, notably fine hemispherical bowls,45 bowls with spiked bases,4" campaniform bowls47 and cones48 are absent. Jars as a whole are poorly represented, being known in most cases only from small fragments from the neck and shoulder. i. Ring-based bowls (Bakun types I-III). Both deep, steep-sided vessels (e.g. Figs. o10: 3-10o; 12: 1, 6) and shallower forms with widely flaring sides (Figs. 9: 2, 3; I I: 6, o10, i16) occur within a wide diameter range from about I i to over 30 cm. Particularly satisfactory are some of the intermediate forms (Figs. II: 4, 5, 7, 8 ; I2: IO, Ii). Fig. 9: I, the only complete example found, is perhaps also the most beautifully proportioned. In addition, certain vessels have slightly inverted rims (Figs. 9 : 4; I3: 2) and one example (Fig. 9: 5) has a high carina- tion. 35 E. F.

Scale i:4.</page><page sequence="18">58 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES Nearly all the bowls within this class are fine and well made and decorated with elaborate, well-executed designs. Exceptional are the vessels illustrated in Fig. 14: 2, 3 which are slightly coarser and heavier, and which have'a very simple decoration of vertical and wavy lines. This type is common in levels IVb and c but does not occur thereafter. As might be expected the larger, deeper bowls are usually decorated only on the exterior (Figs. 13: 2 and I2: 5 are exceptions) whereas interior decoration, particularly in the form of stylized boars (Fig. 9: 2) is found on the majority of smaller, shallower vessels. Decoration on both the interior and exterior of the same bowl (Fig. I I: 6, 8) is exceedingly rare. 2. Saucers. Nos. 12 and I3 in Fig. I2 illustrate shallow, probably flat-based bowls from level II and the surface. This shape is also rare at Bakun.49 3. Simple bowls with flat or rounded bases. The only two complete examples of this type are illustrated in Fig. 14: 14, 15. Other plain buff ware bowls, of which the shape of the base is less certain, appear in Fig. 14: 9-13. Such bowls are sometimes decorated by a painted stripe or stripes around the rim, and one example (Fig. 14: 9) was covered inside and out with a layer of thin reddish-brown paint or slip. Of the painted wares, Fig. I I: 12 and Fig. 12: 3-4 possibly also belong to this category, while Fig. 13: 5 shows a coarser, more conical bowl with interior decoration. Very fine hemispherical bowls (Bakun, type IV) have not occurred so far at Pasargadae. It is interesting that they also appear to be absent from the lowest level of Tall-i-Bakun A with which, as we have seen, Tall-i-Nokhodi III and IV possibly correspond. 4. Conical bowls. These correspond to Bakun, type V. They are vessels with flaring sides, slightly incurving towards the rim, and with small, conical bases. The lower sections, usually plain, are found in all levels except I (Fig. 14: i6). Fig. Io: 2 could represent the upper part of a fine painted example although there is no evidence for the shape of its base. 5. Beakers. The typical Tall-i-Nokhodi beaker has a rounded base and slightly flaring sides (Fig. I: 1-3), thus corresponding to Bakun, type IXA.5? Part of a rare variety with a ring base comes from level II (Fig. 14: 21). A very coarse, thick-sided storage jar from IVb (Fig. 14: i1) should perhaps be included within this group since it closely resembles Tall-i-Bakun type IXB in shape.51 6. Cups (Tall-i-Bakun type XII). Fragments of small carinated bowls with rounded bases and slightly flaring sides were found in levels III and IV (Fig. I I: I1i). The fabric is inclined to be slightly coarser and the designs simpler than in the other bowls. Vertical sides and inverted rims, most common at Tall-i-Bakun, are absent. 7. Jars. Although fragments of jars were found in all levels, only one or two complete shapes can be definitely attested. Both small fine jars, corresponding to Bakun type VIII and heavier storage jars, corresponding to Bakun type IX occur. Small jars are made of the same thin fabric as the finer bowls. Fig. 13 3 is only 2 mm. thick at the shoulder. This jar and Fig. I3: I both have medium to narrow necks with slightly everted rims, globular bodies, low carinations and slightly curving bases. Pots of this general shape also occur at Bakun52 but usually have a higher carination, like the smaller, squatter vessel illustrated in Fig. I2: 19. Necks can be straight (Fig. I2: 20), slightly flaring (Fig. 14: 4) or with an overhanging rim (Fig. 8: 43), this last shape being particularly typical at Bakun A.53 A unique bottle top is illustrated in Fig. 14: 7. The only complete large jar was found standing in one corner of the house in trench A, level IIIb. It had a simple rim and a large, rather elongated oval body terminating in a very small, flat base. Other jar necks from similar vessels are illustrated in Fig. 14? 5-6. They may incline slightly outwards or inwards and are usually painted solid or with a band around the rim. Whereas the smaller jars "O Ibid., pl.

Certain sherds are difficult to fit into any category. Fig. I I: 9 illustrates a very small, fine rim sherd which could belong to a small bowl or possibly a beaker. Fig. I I: 14 could be a shallow tumbler mid-way between a beaker and a cup. Fig. I I: 13 has a rim design reminiscent of that around the tops of shallow beakers in Susa A54 but could, from its size and shape, equally well come from a jar rim. Fig. I I: 16 is either a bowl or a large jar. A very large unpainted bowl is illustrated in Fig. 14: 8. Fragments of two plain handles, circular in section, came from level IVc. Ring bases are usually of medium height and painted solid, although one unstratified example (Fig. 14: 19) was ornamented with triangles in reverse. A more squat variety with projecting foot (Fig. 14: i8) occurs in level IV, while in level II a very simple shape similar to that found also in the red ware seems to predominate (Fig. 14: 17). An unusual miniature form is shown in Fig. 14 20o. Pottery Designs from Levels II, III and IV The buff ware designs at Tall-i-Nokhodi can be divided fairly easily into those identical with or related to the main Bakun tradition, and those peculiar to the site, or pointing to connections with Susa, Mesopotamia or elsewhere. Beaker designs form a good example of this. In level IV the sides of the beaker are divided into panels by wide vertical stripes of dark paint, and the panels are filled with horizontal bands of paired dashes (Fig. i i: I; 8: 39). In level III on the other hand the vertical stripes are left in reserve and the main design centres around a central zig-zag (Fig. i1: 2, 3). This arrangement is very common at Bakun55 whereas the earlier design is not found. Cross-hatched panels around a central zig-zag (Fig. I I: 14) occur in level II and cross-hatching itself occurs predominantly in level III and upwards. As at Bakun, bowls are generally decorated with a wide band of repeating elements bordered by narrow horizontal stripes and sometimes rows of triangles. Looser arrangements (Fig. I I: 7) also sometimes occur. Motifs common to both sites include panels with a diamond fill56 (Fig. 1o: 8), horizontal zig-zags with a fill of denticulated lines57 (Fig. Io0: Io) and an unusual form of reversing triangle5s (Fig. io: 9). Local variations of designs from further south include a progression of isosceles triangles between denticulated right-angled ones (Fig. o10: 3),59 the triangle rhomboid designe60 with one of its triangles reversed (Fig. I I: 5) and, in particular, diagonally divided panels with a fill of denticulated triangles, which appears to be one of the most common designs on the site61 (Fig. o10: 2, 4-7). Rhomboids also occur alone (Figs. 10: I; I I: 4). Stylized plant motifs (Figs. 9: 3; I i: 6) have Bakun prototypes,62 but not the more realistic "tree " design of Fig. 9: 4. Also difficult to parallel are columns of solid eyes arranged around a central vertical stem (Fig. 13: 12) and columns of denticulated triangles (Fig. 12: i1). Divided ovoids63 (Fig. 13: Ii) and hatched diamonds"4 (Fig. 13: 15) extend south-east as far as Mddavdn, although a progression of semi-ovoids (Fig. 13: Io) is more unusual. Other motifs common to both sites include hatched eye shapes (Fig. 13: 14) ;65 bull's eyes (Fig. 13: i3);66 thin chevrons (Fig. 8: 49);67 and horizontal zig-zags in reserve (Fig. I2: I I).68 Denticulation (passim) is almost more common at Tall-i-Nokhodi than it is at Bakun.69 A good 53 Ibid., pl. 1 2: 12.

Fragments of linear designs appear in Fig. 8: 44, 47. Vertical lines drawn between the rim and base of a bowl (Fig. 14: 2, 3) are occasionally found at Bakun70 but the sweep and simplicity of the examples illustrated recalls 'Ubaid pottery. Also ultimately stemming from the Mesopotamian repertoire are shaped motifs-" arrowheads ", " V "s, and double and multiple blobs (Figs. I I: 10, 12; 12: 10, I1I; 13: 9; 8: 46); stylized birds (Fig. 8: 41); and maltese crosses (Fig. 13: i1, 2, 4). Short wavy lines occur either in blocks (Fig. 13: 8) or alone (Fig. I I: 3, 9).71 Grids of triangles with or without hatched backgrounds (Fig. 12: 14-17)72 and horizontal zig-zags with a fill of denticulated lines represent still other patterns that probably developed from Mesopotamian motifs.73 Links with Tepe Giyan, particularly level Vc, are fairly numerous but are invariably the same as those known already from Bakun. Certain other designs equate fairly closely with Susa A. Most interesting are some that do not seem to occur further south-a line of birds' necks around the top of a beaker or smalljar (Fig. I I I3),7 and the use of pairs of suspended triangles and elongated animals to decorate the interior of bowls (Fig. I2: 4, 5).7- A row of small suspended triangles (Fig. I2: 3) is also more typical of Susa, whereas suspended fringed triangles (Fig. I2: 7) are very common at Tepe Musyan.76 Reminiscent of Musyan, too, are rows of ladders77 (Fig. 8: 48) and narrow diamonds (Fig. 8: 5o).78 Step designs79 (Fig. 8: 40) and dovetailed denticulated triangless8 (Fig. 8: 45) occur both at Susa and Bakun. Animal Designs It was in the animal designs of Tall-i-Nokhodi that the individuality of the local potters made itself felt, for although ibex forms8' (Figs. 13: 6; 12: 8), lizards,82 and miniature animals typical of Susa A and Bakun83 are fairly common they co-exist with far more realistic or even fantastic creatures that seem to be more typical of the site. The nearest attempt at portraiture occurs in the animals racing around the side of the pot in Fig. 9: i1. Although the " skid " position is adopted, the legs are attached separately to the body instead of being a continuation of it and definite attention is paid also to such details as cloven hooves, knees, and the shape of the head (which is hornless). Such stumpier forms do occasionally appear at Bakun but are static in comparison. On the other hand some of our heads strikingly resemble that of a doe with long pricked ears, found on a sherd at Tepe Musyan84 and identified as a species still living in the forests of Luristan. It is also tempting to regard the lines trailing from the necks as lassoes or snares into which the animals had incautiously blundered-though whether one can go further and deduce that some form of hunting magic was also involved is uncertain. Similar lines trail from the noses of some of the Bakun deer.85 The animals of Fig. 13: 3 are probably the same species despite their curious resemblance to donkeys. Here the fantastic element is creeping in in the curiously elaborated tails and whirling 70 Bakun, pl. 30: 8. n Cf. A. Perkins, Comparative Archaeology of Early Mesopotamia, 1948, fig.

Utterly crude and fantastic are the stylized " boars" found only, but then very frequently, on the interior of small ring-based bowls (Figs. 9: 2; I2: 3). Fragments of over twenty-two different vessels were discovered with this last motive, of which all but four came from level IV. Similar boar-motives are only represented at Bakun by one or two doubtful sherds and only a single example has so far been published from the Susa wares. Thus it seems likely that the boar had some special significance for these local potters,86 unless further examples are found from unexcavated sites in the future. Stratigraphy The results of a sherd count from our main control trench B are tabulated below. It will be seen that in levels IIIb and IVa-c buff and painted wares are found in fairly equal proportions, with straw- tempered coarse wares forming only 4-5 % of the total. As we have seen, certain beaker and animal designs are more favoured in level IV and are superseded in III by more typical Bakun motifs. But since classical Bakun designs (Fig. Io: 3) and figurines occur in the lowest levels as well, the present distinction may simply be due to the accident of excavation. Isolated red ware sherds occur as early as IVc-the undoubted result of pitting. In IIIb, however, red ware sherds occur in increased numbers and in IIIa coarse grit tempered wares, typical of levels I and II, begin to outnumber coarse straw- tempered ones.

(Note: In levels I and II red wares, and grit tempered coarse wares were counted together.) In level II the new culture almost entirely supersedes the old. Not only is there a change in the pottery, but the walls of the houses are better built of solid, well-defined bricks at a different alignment to those below. Two new types of oven appear, and the use of copper is well attested. Buff ware sherds continue in fair numbers through to level I, but they now form between only 10-13 % of the total, while painted sherds amount to only 4% in level II, i % by Ib. The presence of many of these sherds can probably be explained by pitting. On the other hand it is difficult to similarly explain the large pot fragments which came from the mixed stratum of stones in level II, for while it is possible that these were merely older vessels re-used at a later period, many of the fragments found are rather heavier than the painted wares of the earlier period and the designs on them are less imaginative (Figs. 9: 3; I I: 15). The most logical explanation would seem to be that there was a general decline in the local tradition, which hung on tenuously in level II but faded out thereafter. With regard to the general nature of the transition in Fars between the buff and red ware cultures this last evidence is particularly important. For although it is hardly proof of a true transitional 86 Wild boar still inhabit the Tang-i-Bulaghi, a short distance from the site.</page><page sequence="24">64 JOURNAL OF PERSIAN STUDIES period from one culture to the next-when the red wares immediately, and almost completely, supplant the buff ones-it does seem to rule out any possibility of a long gap between the two cultures. This in turn means that if the buff wares of Tall-i-Nokhodi and Tall-i-Bakun A can be equated with Susa A and the beginning of the Uruk sequence in Iraq, there is good evidence for supposing that the red ware culture was contemporary with the middle phase of the Uruk period.87 Also if we accept this date, it must be conceded that several points of interest, such as the red ware culture's advanced metal work and its possible relationship to the Uruk culture, make it an interesting new factor that calls for further investigation. 87 It should be added that stratified organic material from level IVc has been submitted to the British Museum Research Laboratory for Carbon 14 examination.
