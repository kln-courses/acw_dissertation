All rights reserved SUBJECT REVIEWS (* denotes that a book is specially recommended for school libraries.) Greek Literature 'Listen, you country bumpkins, you pot-bellied blockheads .. .'-no, calm down: I don't mean you. That's Hesiod's Muses, speaking through the voice of Apostolos Athanassakis, whose respected translations of HesiodI and the Homeric Hymns2 have been reissued in revised form with expanded introduction and notes. He is modest in his claims: 'I have aimed for accuracy rather than for poetic effect.' But clarity and accuracy are substantial virtues. Nor is it necessarily true that 'a freer trans- lation would be more elegant, and even more dynamic and moving', as yet another new entry into the increasingly overcrowded market of translations of the Hymns reminds us. How could anyone sensitive to Greek, to poetry, or to the numinous turn Hymn to Aphrodite 167 into 'a man, badly informed, slept with a goddess'? Sarah Ruden3 can be admirably direct and economical, but her renderings are often misleading ('I'm going to die' suggests fatal illness or injury, not mortality), out of register ('your classy parents . . . they're not trashy people'), or just odd ('Otreus is my really famous father'). Moreover, this version's competitive price does not come cheap: the sparse supporting material will leave most readers with many unanswered questions. There are alternatives (notably, Michael Crudden: G&amp;R 29 [2002], 239), but Athanassakis remains a leading contender. Hesiod's Muses speak many falsehoods that resemble truths. The psychoanalytic Muse is less choosy. She has persuaded Mark Buchan,4 but not me, that (for example) desire enters Phaeacia only with the arrival of Odysseus (17); that the Cyclops is 'introduced into the realm of language' only when he loses his eye (21); that 'the Phaeacians have a perfect language, which . . . precludes the possibility of deception' (37); that the shame which inhibits Nausicaa from speaking openly of marriage to her father is 'not shame at all' (195). The trick, of course, is redefinition. 'For psycho- analysis, there is no desire without a prohibition' (195). So if daddy is happy to indulge Nausicaa's desire, it is not 'properly human' desire. And since it is not transgressive, she cannot be ashamed. One might argue in reverse: since she is ashamed, she must be aware of prohibitions that her desire might transgress; so, even if she gets away with it this time, prohibitions and therefore 'properly human' desire must be present in Phaeacia before Odysseus' arrival. The execution of Buchan's argument is as flawed as its basic premises. Franz Albrecht's work Hesiod. Theogony, Works and Days, Shield. Translated with introduction and notes by Apostolos N.

Albrecht delights in detail, but disjointedly. He does not subject any single extended battle-narrative to sustained analysis to show that it presents a consistent, and consistently credible, picture. I doubt whether anyone could succeed in doing that; but Albrecht's willingness to cast aside whatever does not fit his model as 'poetic embellishment' reveals how limited are his resources for coping with the text's resistance to being treated as documentation of military Realien. He shows little awareness of the text as narrative, and correspondingly little sophistication in his method. Malcolm Willcock's appendix, as well as giving an update on more recent work, highlights some important flaws in his conclusions. The same stable also recently produced a trans- lation of Friedrich's Wounding and Death, received without enthusiasm by my predecessor (G&amp;R 51 (2004), 253); I cannot greet its successor any more warmly. Gregory Nagy's Homer's Text and Language6 brings together five previously published papers, developing Nagy's 'evolutionary model' and debating the composition and transmission of Homer, and Aristarchus' textual studies, with West and Janko. Nagy's habit of making unnecessary books out of previously published papers has moved me to adverse comment in the past (and the addition of four unrelated pieces as Part II suggests that he has not kicked the habit). But in this case, I concede that having these detailed discussions of such complex issues in a single collection does make it easier to see what is going on. That does not neces- sarily work in Nagy's favour. My scepticism about West's argument that it was Didymus, rather than Aristarchus, who systematically compared manuscripts has begun to erode in the face of Nagy's discussion of the relevant scholia, marred (in my view) by occasional mistranslations and by persistently arbitrary inferences. Nagy bizarrely criticises West for choosing readings because he thinks they are right (not 'for the simple reason that it stems from one manuscript tradition or another', 45), and wastes pages accumulating examples to prove that West is self-consistent (or, as Nagy puts it, 'the pervasiveness of West's attitude', 82). Perhaps overlook- ing the difference between a reconstruction of a definitive text and a definitive reconstruction, and despite quoting West's clear disclaimer (68), Nagy attributes to his opponents the futile quest for an 'elusive certainty'; yet he goes on to suggest that he can show us the way to 'another certainty' (37). How can that be? Consider an example: Alexandrian variants may only be diagnosed as conjecture if they are inconsistent with the formulaic system; but if we found such a variant, 'it could mean simply that we do not have enough data about the formulaic system' (128). Insulating your position against any possible counter-evidence is, indeed, one way of achieving certainty. But the methodological cost is high. 'The phrases "utterance of the enunciation" (knonce de l'Pnonciation) and "uttered enunciation" (enonciation knonce) designate the com- ponents of the utterance (inonce) that point to its enunciation or performance.' Got that? I hope so: for if the translator's explanatory note (4) defeats you, Claude 5 Battle and Battle Description. A Contribution to the History of War. By Franz Albracht.

Even the translator gives up on the 'isotopies' that recur throughout this collection; if you want to know what they are, Calame refers you to another book (198 n. 4). Is the effort repaid? I am not convinced that it needs a page of semio-narrative grammatical formalization to understand Sappho's 'I say [the most beautiful thing] is whatever one loves'. The analysis concludes: 'The procedures and words used by the enunciative instance, which technical prudence requires us (without disrespect to Sappho) to call the speaker-narrator, could not be more transparent: for the woman or man who takes responsibility for the enunci- ation of the poem, the most beautiful thing is that which arouses in the anthropomorphic subject, whoever it be, the feeling of love' (58). That's certainly less transparent than Sappho. And yet . . . the endnotes manifest a depth of schol- arship that makes me think there ought to be more to all this than I have managed to detect. David Wiles has translated the Hypsipyle fragments, embedding them in a performable frame as mechanical and unimaginative in its self-referentiality as Harrison's Trackers was brilliantly creative. Did this deserve its place in Lost Dramas of Classical Athens?8 Does the whole volume deserve a place on our shelves? Some collections are more than the sum of their parts; this is not one of them. It includes good contributions, which could just as well have been published separately; others needed much more work before they were published at all. To conclude that 'the motif of ghostly appearances was more common than the extant corpus of Greek tragedy (and comedy) suggests' (112), one needs to do more than mention examples in tragic fragments and art: the question is whether there are more examples than extrapolation from the extant corpus predicts. I could not detect that quantitative argument. Another contribution moves from the observation that filicidal madness is sometimes inspired by Dionysus to 'the portrayal of mothers slaying their sons in tragedy can therefore be understood as a Dionysiac theme and one which is especially suited to tragedy' (130f.). Child-killing would be perfectly suited to tragedy even if it were nothing to do with Dionysus; and while there is no doubting the connection between child-killing and madness, Dionysus has no monopoly on inspiring madness. No argument was forthcoming to show that there is anything specifically Dionysiac about child-killing. If the idea is that filicidal madness occurs in tragedy because it is a Dionysiac motif, and we know it is a Dionysiac motif because it appears in tragedy, the circularity would be too trans- parent. By now, you may be getting the impression that I have spent the last six months in a permanently grumpy mood. It would only reinforce that impression if I were to comment on the absurdly pretentious meditation on string theory with which The Soul of Tragedy opens.9 So I will focus instead on the papers that follow, collected in memory of Charles Segal and exploring some of the varied trajectories of Segal's own work. It is a worthy tribute. Even those who did not find Segal's angles of approach unfailingly persuasive will be able to recognize the intellectual 7 Masks of Authority.

David Konstan and Karen Bassi say inter- esting things about Aristotle, John Gibert about Clytaemnestra's first marriage, Martha Nussbaum about comic crowbars and erections. Mark Griffith discusses psychoanalytic criticism of tragedy, and of Antigone in particular, with exceptional lucidity and intelligence. Admittedly, he did not get me past the anticipated 'stum- bling block' (99): I still see no reason to believe that Freudian or Lacanian models make any sustained connection with reality. But I cannot deny that the psychoana- lytic Muse is on her best behaviour here. Simon Goldhill strays from the volume's advertised theme to bring a finely argued and philologically acute scepticism to bear on a restoration in Posidippus, moving with finesse between minute detail, a broad context, and larger cautionary lessons. While we're on the subject of Posidippus, and of collective volumes that do earn their keep, the The New Posidippusl0 is a weighty addition to the industry generated by P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309. It contains a translation by Frank Nisetich; papers on the book-roll itself, its readers and (ancient) editors; on the individual thematic sections of the collection; on the Ptolemaic context, poetic and political; and on the collection as a book. This is too large and too diverse a collection to be assessed in brief, and I am sure it does not need me to say that it will be core reading for anyone interested in any aspect of this find. I confess that I find the papyrus roll itself more interesting than the poems; others will judge whether that says more about Posidippus or about me. Since I began my incumbency by confessing that proliferating handbooks and guides make me especially grumpy, mention of Blackwell's Companion to Greek Tragedy"1 might be expected to presage a return to negativity. Not a bit of it! This is a substantial and well-planned collection, with few really weak contributions and many excellent ones-for example, Scott Scullion's economical, informative, and well-argued treatment of origins; Douglas Cairns' incisive chapter on values; Jocelyn Penny Small's persuasively sceptical discussion of illustrations of tragedy; and the account of Euripides by Justina Gregory, the editor, herself. The volume has a four-part structure: Contexts, Elements, Approaches, Reception. 'Elements' means largely formal components, but also myth and music. 'Aspects' or 'Topics' might have been a better title than 'Approaches', since this section avoids a parade of -isms and -ologies. This was a wise decision: the one exception, Christiane Sourvinou-Inwood's 'Tragedy and anthropology', is very disappointing. It begins by defining 'anthropological approach' in terms so broad that the concept loses all its distinctiveness, and therefore needs a crudely caricatured 'postmodernist' opponent of straw to do battle against (295); but then there is a sudden jump to the method- ology which Sourvinou-Inwood herself favours, which is far more narrowly defined and far more contentious. Cairns has some pertinent comments on her approach (305f.), but there is unfortunately no cross-reference between these two adjacent chapters. The absence of any imposed consensus is admirable, and attentive readers of the whole volume will discover that there are radical disagreements among experts; but if the contributors had been put into explicit dialogue by more systematic cross-referencing, that effect would have been strengthened. Still, most chapters are heavily referenced, and so provide a good point of entry to the scholarly 1o The New Posidippus. A Hellenistic Poetry Book. Edited by Kathryn Gutzwiller. Oxford UP, 2005.

Such a rich resource deserved a richer index, and the inexpert will find the chapter on fifth-century history hard to follow without a map. My only major complaint about this excellent volume concerns the section on Reception, which jumps directly from the Italian Renaissance to Nietzsche: at this point, something went seriously wrong with the planning, which in every other respect is remarkably systematic and comprehensive. Duckworth continues to supply readers of tragedy with its own brand of companionship. Of the three latest additions to its series, Michael Lloyd's treatment of Sophocles' Electra12 is outstanding, a model of what such books should be. He outflanks my reservations about the synopses that are a regular feature of the series by expanding this chapter into an informative mini-commentary. Here and in the thematic chapters (Stagecraft, Electra, Matricide) he consistently succeeds in conveying a sense of the state of current scholarly debate and the range of interpretative options, deftly sampling the secondary literature through summary and well-chosen quotation. This approach poses questions for the reader to consider, and comments on a variety of possible answers without foreclosing judgement. Frequent reference to other plays ensures that a strong sense of the generic context is maintained. Barbara Goward, on Agamemnon,13 is predictably strong on narrative and dramatic technique. The synoptic chapter concentrates on reconstructing the stage action; the synopsis itself is relegated to an appendix, where it is combined with analysis of formal structure. The divide between formal structure and staging is awkward, and symptomatic of a larger problem. A series format that eschews serial analysis can make it difficult to convey a sense of the text as a design that unfolds through time. The scale and complexity of Agamemnon exacerbates that difficulty. Goward's treatment left me with a sense of fragmentation: the play had been presented as a heap of disparate bits, not as an organized and functioning whole. Hanna Roisman's Philoctetes14 is predictably strong in tracing ambiguities and possible hidden motives. She, too, enlarges the synopsis with analysis (for example, 44f. usefully points out the dilemmas set up in the opening scene). She faces less of a challenge in organizing the thematic chapters, since the triangle of characters provides an obvious ordering principle. But that brings with it a risk that the characters will be read through a grid of abstract polarities, effacing the concrete particularity of their respective situations and histories. Roisman does not entirely avoid this trap, and also falls prey to the danger inherent in focusing on hidden motives: it can create too great an emotional distance from the characters. I am astonished by the failure of imagination and sympathy which can regard Philoctetes as someone who has suffered a 'personal insult', like Achilles, (106), and comment censoriously on his 'harping on the past and holding on to his sense of victimisation' (79f.). Ten years after his comrades had dumped him, alone and in agony, on a deserted shoreline, how is he supposed to react to their self-serving change of mind? ('Hi, guys-great to see you again. No hard feelings! Anything I can do to help?') As often, emotional distance in turn impairs moral judgement. 'His honour offended he feels no more 12 Sophocles. Electra. By Michael Lloyd.

What obligation could possibly remain intact after such a betrayal? In the chapter on reception Roisman concentrates on the twentieth century (her discussion of Heaney's Cure at Troy displays a shaky grasp of the recent history of Northern Ireland, apparently construing the widowing of policeman's wives as an act of 'British oppression', 121). Goward oddly chooses to focus on Seneca and English Renaissance revenge dramas, with the result that Aeschylus gets very little look-in until a parallel to Hamlet which turns on the unpersuasive premise that the chorus and Hamlet can be compared as the 'central figures' of their respective plays (129). Lloyd again does best, giving an excellent account of French classicism, as well as of Hoffmanstahl and Strauss. Susan Lape's Reproducing Athens15 tackles the apparent absence of politics from New Comedy in several ways: by using 'political' in a more extended sense; by suggesting that politics appears in coded form (braggart soldiers as 'surrogates' for kings: 62f.); and-most interestingly-by arguing for an ideological effect. Seeking an explanation for the resilience of democratic culture through the suspension of democratic institutions, Lape suggests that the matrimonial and reproductive norms which defined citizenship continued to underwrite 'democratic Athenian ideology' (8); the enactment of these norms on the comic stage served not only to express this ideology, but also (re)produced it (11). It is, to be sure, hard to imagine a public discourse that has no ideological effect whatsoever. The crucial questions are: what effect, and how large an effect? Lape is careful not to overstate her claim for comedy. But once the possibility of other, perhaps more important, ideological vectors is admitted, then it must surely also be admitted that the resilience of democratic culture in the absence of democratic political institutions might be explicable without reference to comedy. Lape's claim for comedy therefore faces an evidential challenge. There may also be a problem of circularity, since the equation between citizen status (defined by marital norms) and political rights (defined by democratic ideology) presupposes a commitment to democracy. I worry, too, about the ease with which Lape moves from 'democratic' to 'Athenian' to 'civic', from 'Athens' to 'the democratic polis' to 'the Greek polis'. How does Lape's distinctively Athenocentric starting-point square with claims about comedy's inextricable ties to 'the continuity of democratic Athenian and transnational polis culture' (10, my emphasis)? And is it true to say that comedy enacts the reproductive norms, when irregular sexual unions are consistently represented as leading to desirable outcomes? Lape is not unaware of such problems, and I was impressed to discover how persistently my incipient objec- tions were addressed. The resulting picture is complex, subtle and flexible; readers will need to judge for themselves how far that flexibility is achieved by surrendering substance. Whenever I meet the cliche of 'complex negotiation', I begin to suspect that a retreat has begun in the direction of claims whose indefiniteness and immunity to testing are mutually reinforcing. Yet Lape's ideas are sophisticated and original, and certainly deserve careful and critical attention. Is Menander a Hellenistic poet? The question is, apparently, a 'tired' one. I'm puzzled that it has ever been asked: what would the point of an answer be? But if it is asked, it needs a better answer than: 'It is clear that the play is firmly anchored in the world of 15 Reproducing Athens.

That is not a distinctive Hellenistic concern: it is recurrent in the Greek tradition from Homer and Hesiod onwards. This oversight is particularly surprising, since it goes directly against the programmatic insight that is central to the imposing collaborative study of Hellen- istic poetry by Marco Fantuzzi and Richard Hunter, first published in Italian,16 and more recently issued in a 'revised and augmented' English version, with updated references and a new chapter on 'languages of praise'.17 The preface promises (vii-viii) 'serious analysis and hard thinking about the complexity of the Hellenistic engagement with the past', the 'principal purpose' being 'to set Hellenistic poetry within its own intellectual and cultural context'. The authors stress that Hellenistic (like most ancient) poetry 'emphasises tradition and continuity, rather than modernist rupture, even when at its most innovative', but are willing to defy cliche: 'homage to their great ancestors was not (necessarily) a sign of "anxiety".' (Isn't it obvious that influence can be a source of reassurance and confidence? What does the currently pervasive preoccupation with diagnosing ancient anxieties say about contemporary classicists?) 'Hellenistic poetry has suffered from lazy (un)critical generalisations ... Generalisations have their uses ... but one must begin with the particularity of each poet and each poetic mode'. The book delivers on this promise: it is rich, detailed, and discriminating. It will not be easy going for readers who do not already know their way round the subject. Such a wide-ranging book needed a programmatic introduction to provide orientation; instead, Chapter 1 launches straight into dense discussion of the texts. But those who persist will find it extremely enlightening-and not only about Hellenistic poetry: it also throws an incidental retrospective light on earlier literature. Like Fantuzzi and Hunter, Roberto Nicolai18 is cautious about conventional periodization and resists the tendency to simplify literary history by constructing radical breaks that conceal deep continuities. His specific concern is the extent to which emergence of the (prose) book as a medium of communication at the end of the fifth century produced in prose literature an anticipation of the Hellenistic transformation of the system of poetic genres. His answer focuses on Isocrates' decisive contribution, examining the genres of Isocrates' logoi in the first (and longer) of the two parts, and his modes of composition and forms of publication in the second. This is an important contribution to the study of an author who in recent years has shown encouraging signs of emerging from undeserved neglect. Lucian: Selected Dialogues19 is oddly titled (the selection is not restricted to dialogues) and ludicrously priced: presumably it will soon metamorphose into an affordable World's Classic. Having praised the virtues of clarity and accuracy, I should not complain that Costa's rather wooden prose gives little sense of Lucian's stylistic gifts (I doubt, in any case, whether my own venture into Lucian translation qualifies me 16 Muse e modelli.

But pedantry compels me to insist that Odysseus was Homer's advocate in the case against Thersites, not his 'lawyer'; in this respect, at least, Paul Turner's partially overlapping Penguin selection is more accurate as well as livelier. (I note belatedly, but have not seen, the existence of a more recent Penguin by Keith Sidwell, which must be worth a look.) The Myths of Fiction20 examines the use of myth and literary allusion in the Greek novel, and effectively shows their diversity. But as a whole the volume (yet another assemblage of previously published material) is very uneven in quality and depth; the analyses are often pretty thin. They also seem to have little connection with the introductory sketch of the world in which the novels were written-which is a good thing, for I could not recognize in this sketch ('demoralization caused by living in a society in which the polis had lost its autonomy and no real, meaningful public debate was allowed . . . alienated from the present and dislocated from the past', 6) the energetic, clever, confident, and creative Greeks I have met in my own work on this period. Tim Rood21 provides a study of the reception of two words in Xenophon-more precisely, one word twice. Or so he teasingly claims (2). In fact, some of the appropriations of those words carry with them a sense of the larger context; others do not. That variation is one of the many interesting things which his unusual choice of subject reveals. There is enough unfamiliar, sometimes surprising, material in this wide-ranging survey to keep the reader's attention; and though parading short echoes of a short phrase inevitably tends to give a fragmented impression, that is generally kept in check by a stimulating and not too heavy-handed commentary. Yet I came away only partially satisfied. Rood certainly made me want to reread the Anabasis, and equipped me to do so more intelligently; but he did not leave me thinking 'I must read that' of anything else. But Rood is not to blame if his authors sometimes made me wish that Xenophon's companions had confined themselves to silence and a wild surmise. doi: 10.1017/S0017383506000313 MALCOLM HEATH 20 The Myths of Fiction.

Latin Literature This collection starts with three Italian contributions to Plautine studies. For the first, a series of popular editions of the comedies I described earlier1 now includes an edition of Stichus.2 As in the previous plays, the Mercator and the Persa, and contrary to what is claimed on all three title pages, there is nothing called Prefazione in any of the books. However, the first sixty pages of the Introduzione are identical to the one found in each of the previous editions and are, presumably, Cesare Questa's Prefazione. The remaining twenty-two pages of the Introduzione to Stichus are 1 G&amp;R 52 [2005] 105. 2 Tito Maccio Plauto Stico.

All three editions share an unattractive contrast between the small type of the Latin on the left page and the large type of the translation on the right page; all have substantial bibliographies. The second Italian contribution to Plautine studies is a Festschrift3 to mark the seventieth birthday of Cesare Questa whose contribution to the Italian series of Plautine texts was noted above. This is, however, an unusual Festschrift in that the contributions, six lectures, one each on the Aulularia, the Casina, the Menaechmi, the Miles Gloriosus, the Mostellaria and the Pseudolus, are all the work of the honorand, not of his friends and pupils. For an intriguing account of how this occurred the reader must go to the Premessa (pp. xv-xviii). The third Italian contribution to Plautine studies, from the same series as the Festschrift, and just as elegantly presented, is a text of the Vidularia edited by Roberto Calderan4 and published posthumously, based on a much smaller first edition published in 1982. After several pages devoted to explaining the history of the work and revealing the high esteem both personally and academically in which the editor was held by his colleagues, there follow 35 pages on the history of modern scholarship on the text, 29 pages on the reconstruction of the plot, 21 pages on the source of the play, an excursus of three pages on the dating of Diphilus' Schedia and of Plautus' Vidularia, eight pages on the text, nine pages of the text itself, 48 pages of commentary on the text and on the fragments. There follows a fourth book on Roman comedy, also published posthumously and as a tribute to its author, a trans- lation, in rhyming couplets, of the comedies of Terence by Frederick W. Clayton,5 for many years Professor of Classics at Exeter. Born in 1913, he was of the generation most deeply affected by the Second World War, not least, in his case, among the code breakers in Bletchley Park. Clayton achieved in his life far more than most of us ever will, and yet he runs the risk of being thought of as someone who did not 'do' much, in the special sense of 'do' found in academia. It is to be hoped that the discovery and publication of this translation will go some way towards correcting that impression; if it succeeds it will owe much to Matthew Leigh's sensitive and learned introduction, and even more to an epilogue by one of Clayton's children, an epilogue which recounts the extraordinary life of a brilliant young scholar, an early opponent of appeasement, a code breaker, a novelist but, above all, a humanitarian who, among other things, rescued two Jewish boys from Vienna in 1942, and an enthusiast for literature much revered by his colleagues and students at Exeter. He died in 1999. There will be widespread pleasure that Peter Green, at the age of 78 (he tells us his age himself), is still able to delight us with yet another large-scale and elegantly presented work on a major classical author. His text, translation, and commentary on the Catullan corpus,6 is accessible to the beginner and informative to the specialist.

Having found myself very much in sympathy with the whole introduction, I was a little concerned, very early in the work, to find two details in the translation which seemed to contradict the theory. In 2A, Green follows those who argue that the ambiguity of passer ('bird' or 'penis') is at least present in Catullus' mind. However, passer is the first word of the poem and is not repeated. By translating the word at the beginning of the poem as 'sparrow', and then gratuitously translating it again at line 4 (where it is not present in the Latin) as 'pecker', Green makes explicit what was at most implicit. Green is entitled to demand how else the subtle point could have been made and I acknowledge the difficulty. It may be best to deal with such issues only in the commentary. Similarly, at 4.1, Green follows Ellis in believing that the boat belongs to Catullus. The text simply does not address itself to the issue. Green, however, translates: 'That cutter that you see there, gentlemen, of mine'; not only does 'of mine' commit Green to Ellis's view, but it also creates a very awkward English word order; the natural English order would be 'That cutter of mine that you see there, gentlemen,'; but that would create an unacceptable rhythm. Its omission, however, would not seriously affect the rhythm and it would be faithful to the ambiguity of the text. In the rest of the poem, Green achieves a rhythm which admirably catches the feel of Catullus' Iambic Senarii. But it would be quite wrong to end on such minor points. This is an elegantly presented edition that will become indispensable for all readers of Catullus. Horace must be among the most appreciated of Latin poets by amateurs. There is, after all, a Horatian Society and a Virgil Society but no Plautine, Lucretian, Ovidian, or Silian society. It is also important for professionals to remember that without amateur interest and support the subject would be profoundly weaker. It is, accordingly, a great pleasure to find a new translation of Horace's Odes by no less a figure than the chairman of the Horatian Society, Colin Sydenham.7 The publisher explicitly hopes that this work will be useful both as a purchase by students of Classical Studies and as a gift by fond relatives to acquaint young readers with the delights of Horace. While the latter hope may well be fulfilled, it is difficult to imagine this translation working as a text for Classical Studies students. They need to be able to press their translation in some detail, but this translation, constrained by the self-inflicted demands of rhyme, is necessarily a mass of compromises, especially of order of ideas. See, for instance, the first four lines of Sydenham's translation of 1.6: Let Varius, that bird of epic song, tell of your valour and your glorious exploits of leadership, alike with horse and ship victorious. 7 Horace.

It would be impossible here to give a full account of this very learned but quite limpid account of humour in the satirists. The topics discussed include: what is and what is not funny according to a range of prejudices both ancient and modern? whether one can or should accept the implicit and explicit views of the satirist (Juvenal 6 is an example, but not a sole example, of the obvious difficulties here)? whether the satirist is mocking himself? where humour passes into the grotesque? These and other similar questions are addressed in great detail and with subtlety, but also with great clarity, by a thoughtful scholar who has a very sure-footed technique of analysis. Genevieve Liveley has produced a book on Ovid's love songs,9 another work in the 'Ancients in Action' series.10 It seems to me that Liveley has asked the wrong questions; she has not asked herself what do students need if they are to understand and appreciate these poems, but she has asked herself what she would like to write and, in particular, what would be arresting. It would, for instance, be indulgent to suggest that invoking the ladies of the Women's Institute charity calendar in an introduction to Ovid's Fasti was merely inappropriate; and I leave to one side the issue of whether the Fasti are sensibly described as 'Love Songs'. And where is the latinless student to go if he or she wishes to follow up allusions to Ovid's Sad Songs? With the dawn of the twenty-first century, Francento Citti and Camillo Neri11 have decided to look back at the scholarship on the younger Seneca from the twentieth century. The work is divided into four sections entitled (I translate) 'The philosophical Seneca', 'Seneca the dramatist', 'The character of Seneca', 'Seneca in the Internet', followed by a brief conclusion. Each of these four sections is subdivided into up to eight sections contributed by a variety of scholars. The major theme of the work is the importance of Seneca's contribution to the culture and thought of the twentieth century. There are copious illustrations, many, but not all, connected with the production of plays and films based either on Seneca's tragedies or on the man himself or on themes important to him. Bristol Phoenix Press, that monument to the impossibility of crushing the spirit of John Betts, has published a volume of seventeen essays by Niall Rudd on Latin and English poetry, a splendid testimony to the breadth and depth of his scholarship.12 There can be no better way of conveniently acquainting readers with this work than to list the titles of the individual essays.

Greek History Textbooks in Greek history seem to be coming thick and fast. In the latest contri- bution, the third volume to date in the new Blackwell History of the Ancient World,1 P. J. Rhodes offers us a 'straightforward account': short chapters of narrative in which analysis is embedded, and which combine 'other aspects of Greek life with political and military matters'. By comparison with some other textbooks (Morris and Powell's The Greeks, for example), those other aspects are rather hard to find. There is certainly analysis: the chapter of 'retrospect' on the Athenian empire is a highlight. But the emphasis in this volume is undoubtedly on narrative - and that is, equally undoubtedly, its main strength. Well presented as it is (with time-charts - and, in one 1 A History of the Classical Greek World. 478-323 BC. By P. J. Rhodes. Oxford, Blackwell, 2005. Hardback ?50; paperback ?19.99.</page><page sequence="13">264 SUBJECT REVIEWS of those random design decisions, an inexplicable image of an owl-at the start of every chapter), it may still prove heavy going for some students. But Rhodes' history should render traditional narrative lectures obsolete-and it is an absolute master- piece of precision and restraint, as evidenced for example by his words on the Parthenon sculptures: which 'have been particularly emphasised in arguments as to whether objects removed from their original location, legitimately by the standards of the time but illegitimately by the standards which would be applied to comparable objects found nowadays, ought to be returned'. Just as Rhodes' history is the product of forty years of teaching in the University of Durham, so Thucydides' War Narrative also has a long history.2 It has its origins in a 1975 Berkeley doctoral dissertation and more broadly, as Carolyn Dewald makes clear, in the very different intellectual and political climate of that time. A long introduction then presents the author's original thesis in the context of her intellectual development, and the formation of her unique (?) application to historical narrative of Bakhtinian dialogism ('the narrative is the vehicle through which a complex, three-pronged act of dialogic connection unfolds, linking the historian, the people whose decisions and actions originally came together to create events, and the History's past, present, and future audiences'). The original thesis itself is modest in its method (and written in a beautiful, limpid style). Dewald breaks down the action of the Archidamian war narrative into so many units of action (simple picture units, list units, developed picture units, extended narrative units, and complex, a-b-a structures), each with a fairly standard scene-setting introductory sentence, and so shows how in this section of the History Thucydides achieves an 'austere unity of tone' whilst allowing patterns to emerge from the action and the years to be seen in 'all their quiddity'. In later books, by contrast, the discrete unit of action gradually disappears in favour of a more unified structure, the reflection (it is suggested tentatively) of Thucydides' growing realization of the war being a single complex phenomenon. Dewald's treatment raises some big questions-not least as to why Thucydides' 'narrative habits' change in the way that they do. Her approach seemed to me most rewarding precisely as the original 'unit of action' becomes dissolved. But in her demonstration, for example, of the structural similarities between the account of the Sicilian expedition and Book 8, or her presentation of the years of the Peace of Nicias (in which 'political developments are presented as a long gunpowder trail that Thucydides shows being laid down', with military engagements played down), there is ample justification for this volume's eventual publi- cation. Olga Palagia and Stephen Tracy's edited collection on The Macedonians in Athens 322-229 B.C. contains the proceedings of a conference held in Athens in 2001 (if all the dates are reliable, it took substantially less time from conference to publication than for the published volume to reach my desk - an oddity).3 It takes something of a leap of the imagination to divine clear themes running through the assorted pieces of this volume (a continuing Athenian thirst for freedom? the various responses of the Attic elite to Macedonian domination?). For the most part, we are presented with so many discrete slices of good old-fashioned ancient history: (amongst others) a treatment of the chronology of the 240s (Michael Osborne), a 2 Thucydides' War Narrative.

Kroll), or another of the decrees of the post-Lamian war period, characterizing Athens - tantalizingly - as between oligarchy and democracy (Graham Oliver), as well as other contributions of narrower focus (bizarrely, for example, an indictment of Demetrius Poliorcetes' hetaira, Lamia, for her corrupting influence). The whole volume gives the impression of so many highly specialist craftsmen beavering away at their individual tasks. (There must be a common understanding underlying the division of labour, one senses, but what? - or did discussion throw up sharply variant models? If so, it would be nice to know.) One of the curious highlights for me was a short piece in which Christian Habicht disarm- ingly takes the reader through a series of points on which he has been proved wrong; you wait for the worm to turn even a little, but instead we end with a 'few remarks on another area in which I had recently to change my mind'. Another set of collected essays - again the proceedings of a conference-honours Professor Douglas MacDowell of the University of Glasgow (and the last holder of a chair of Greek that dates back to before the Act of Union).4 The three themes of the volume, Law, Rhetoric and Comedy, pick up the main aspects of the honorand's own research. Even for those of us who do not thrill at discussion of legal procedure, there are rich offerings here: a thoughtful discussion of the point at which a societal norm becomes a law (Arnaoutoglou); staunch defences of the ideas that Athenian laws were meant to be read (Gagarin - with interesting concluding remarks on the subjective, rhetorical element to all legal systems) or that fourth-century readers might have picked up Lysias for pleasure (Usher); convincing reconstructions of the role of Antiphon in the 411 coup (Edwards) or of the early career in forensic oratory of Isocrates (Whitehead); and another contribution to the debate on comic freedom of speech (Sommerstein, arguing that 'neither in theory nor in practice was comedy above the law'). Most refreshing of all, perhaps, is a brisk piece by the ever-trenchant Kenneth Dover in which he relentlessly lampoons the strange industry of allusion-spotting in Aristophanes before expressing his concern at classicists' 'widespread conversion ... to liminalitarianism' (i.e. initiation, ephebes, etc.) All in all, a high-quality volume which delivers an apt tribute to its honorand. Niall Finneran's is the latest addition to an increasingly common sub-genre - the biography of a city or archaeo- logical site, in this case Alexandria.5 He takes the story of Alexandria from its foundation to the present day (this traditional narrative scheme being designed to show how the symbolic associations of a place can evolve and shift while the physical space remains apparently unchanged), and all this in 141 well-spaced, well-illustrated, and accessibly written pages. Finneran's narrative is somewhat inevitably superficial in stretches. After a relatively leisured look at what we might call the Greek, Christian and earlier Islamic periods (though Finneran's thesis is precisely that such labels do not fit) the more modern history of the city is a mad rush that leaves scarcely any space for-what are for me the real draw-the literary evocations of the city of Cavafy or Durrell. ('The post-war period' in Egypt, we are told, 'was marked by conflict with Israel, and then, under President Sadat a move towards peace .. .'). The point of all of this, it emerges, is to show Alexandria as a model of cultural syncretism, an ' Law, Rhetoric, and Comedy in Classical Athens. Essays in Honour of Douglas M. MacDowell.

Finneran's aspirations for Alexandria were undermined for me from the start by his confusing presentation of Alexander himself as a champion of syncretism: 'he believed in syncretic values, and he could almost have been an orientalist, in the old-fashioned sense of the word (by this I mean that he took great pleasure in the aesthetic values of the "Orient").' Much more, I sense, could have been made of these themes (for example, of the symbolism of the appropriation of 'Cleopatra's needles') if only Finneran himself had had the space in which to develop them. And now from a post-modern pre-modern city (as Finneran dubs it) to the story of one (ancient) city's transposition into another (modern) one. Athens in Paris is a study of 'the intercon- nections between French classics and the wider appropriation of antiquity in modern French thought'6, focusing (amongst others) on Sartre, Lacan, Vernant, Lvi-Strauss, Foucault, and Derrida. Rather than, for example, laying out in introduction the institutional connections between her various dramatis personae (some of which would have been helpful), Leonard organizes her material instead into three long (and immensely complex) chapters on the reception of Oedipus, Antigone, and Socrates. Though some of the most interesting passages of the book to me concerned her intellectuals' direct political involvement (or their avoidance of it), the political of her title is generally with a small p, the central themes explored being of a much higher order: the 'difficulties of subjectivity and agency', the 'gaps between ethics and politics', or the 'impossibilities of the relationship between self-analysis and social commitment'. I have a sneaking sense that this book was probably sent to me by mistake - and, though I happily agree with Leonard's (mildly finger-wagging) conclusion that we classicists should all want to explore our intellectual genealogies, I should admit also that Athens in Paris for large stretches defeated me. I am not sure how a non-classicist might respond to the claim that the French debate on the role of the citizen 'took a necessarily classical turn', and I wonder just how au fair a reader would need to be with French classics, Greek tragedy, and continental philosophy to be able to navigate their way through the byways of Athens in Paris without difficulty. But even this bluff ancient historian learnt a number of useful and interesting things (notably from the discussion of Sartre's Trojan Women, and his conflation of ancient and modern colonialism) - and I will never so glibly cite Vernant in a footnote again. doi: 10.1017/S0017383506000337 T.E.

There is a subdivided 'Further Reading' section, an index, and plentiful and pertinent maps and photo- graphs. I would recommend this book to students combining Geography or Geology A-Levels with Classical Civilization, but it has something for all (why Trajan's Column has survived better than Marcus'; the meanings of tuff/tufa/tufo). My complaints are against the cosying up to footsore users that the authors attempt with their invitations to coffee or gelati, and the repetitions (once almost verbatim), in- evitable when field trips follow topographical surveys. I should welcome a handy paperback, field trips abbreviated by reference back to earlier chapters, and the inclusion, segmented, of the city map that the authors recommend. This volume teaches why one side of Rome's most famous monument has suffered so much more than the other. K. Hopkins and M. Beard, in their ebullient and learned *The Colosseum,2 take and give pleasure in guiding us round it, sad as it is that Beard had to pick up Hopkins' papers and complete the book alone. Six different probes go through the subject. The first deals with presentations in literature and guide- books-and our touristic motives; the second expounds the meanings that the building once had. Originality and freshness of thought are found throughout. 'The killing fields' unshrinkingly tackles the frequency of shows, mortality rate, the question of flooding, and how charades like 'Pasiphae' were brought off. 'Life after death' is a biography of the building to the present, including its significance as a source of botanical specimens. Readers get advice on visiting and help with further reading. Entertainingly as everything is done, and with a lightly deployed learning that makes it gripping even to the learned, the book asks a serious question about our attitudes to brutality combined with artistic greatness (questions hardly raised by twentieth-century dictatorships). It does not matter that it cannot answer them; it makes the individual try to answer for himself. A. Fraschetti's title in English is The Foundation of Rome,3 but the original Romolo il Fondatore of the 2002 edition seems to represent the contents better. Seeking his intended audience, we survey the chapters: 'The twins'; 'The foundation'; 'Romulus' government and his wars'; 'The disappearance of the founder: Romulus "cut into pieces" or his apotheosis'; 'Epilogue'. There are two appendices, on Tarpeia and the wall at the foot of the Palatine Hill associated by A. Carandini with Romulus.4 This develops into an account of nineteenth-century, mainly Italian, controversy, while the end of the fourth chapter links 'The death of Romulus and the destiny of Caesar'. This is, as the author states, not a work of ancient history, but of historical anthropology. Fraschetti seeks to follow the 'segments' of the life in a coherent and not, as often, in a 'fragmented' way, to show the individuality that later Romans projected on to a 'civilising hero'. The author is generous with endnotes, but for illustration of the mirror discussed at pp. 7-9 we have only the cover drawing, and Fraschetti's allusiveness does not make life easy for his readers.

Who then is the audience? A final sly reference to 'Liberalismus across the Seine' recalls the origin of the book: seminars delivered at the Ecole pratique des Hautes Etudes. S. Dmitriev has rock in mind, real and metaphorical, in City Government in Hellenistic and Roman Asia Minor,5 rock less volatile than that of Italian volcanoes: it is on the marble and limestone of epigraphic documents, complemented with numismatic, papyrological, and literary evidence, that he builds. Accordingly, there is an index of ancient authors and texts and one of inscriptions and papyri, the latter divided into a list of publica- tions and one of cities and important locales. This takes up thirty-five pages, and there is also an index of names and subjects, and a bibliography. All this is indis- pensable as a reference tool for readers wishing to trace the fates of individual communities in those changing times, to discover the author's interpretation of individual documents, and to assess the over-arching theses constructed on their basis. These, formulated in three sections, Hellenistic, with a chapter on Miletus, Priene, and Samos, provincial, with a chapter on the metropoleis Smyrna and Ephesus, and an overview, differ considerably from received ideas documented in the notes. In particular Dmitriev challenges the view of changes attributable to Roman inter- vention; they were influenced by traditional practice. Again, enfranchised local elites entered the Roman elite; 'interference' was a form of interaction between segments of that. These theses lead to a reassessment of Roman imperial practice overall. Other subjects are dealt with en route: the word arche and its relation to leitourgia (in contrast with Roman vocabulary), the classification of city offices, the gap between socially and politically significant posts, the roles of women and children, the survival of the role of the assembly. Turning west, we come to another place, rocky in every sense. M. Kulikowski has worked Late Roman Spain and its Cities6 and his disciplined labour has done a service in helping to open up a region that is only now receiving the attention due to it, especially in its later phase. He appreciates continuity between early and late Empires, and starts with the thesis that Roman urbanism, developed in the first and second centuries, remained stronger than scholars have supposed. Only after 460 were the ancient foundations destroyed, the last vestiges at the end of the sixth century. Kulikowski, in constructing his work, contended with failings in Spanish archaeology, now remedied, but damage has been done. There was also desperate willingness to attach material finds, sometimes ascribed ethnic identity, to unsatisfactory literary evidence, making up stories that came to seem Gospel when material evidence demanded priority. So Kulikowski's methodological theme, caution, recurs throughout. There are consequential subordinate themes, too, about the third- century 'crisis' (with interesting remarks on the decline of the epigraphic habit) and the comparative importance of Diocletian's reforms (Tingitana surprisingly signif- icant). There is useful preparatory work on the creation of Roman Spain and urban institutions before the chapters on change. The story of Christianity (long an extra-mural affair, the author claims) offers refreshment, and the last chapters deal with the Goths, and the new world.

Nearer home we have in A. R. Birley's The Roman Government of Britain7 a new incarnation, longer by 56 pages, of his standard Fasti of Roman Britain of 1981. Beginning with an appendix of additions to that list of officials, he ended with a completely new version. Birley is master of the literature and the slimmed-down Bibliography (nine new or revised works of W. Eck!), itself shows how well justified this enterprise is. Friendliness has been another aim (even the cover is jollier): translations have been added, and (one may regret) have replaced Greek except in inscriptions. There has been some condensation, and 'The senatorial career' now contains items from 'Origins and careers of governors', a section of Fasti now omitted (to the regret of prosopographers). Most importantly, imperial visits and historical developments (the Gallic Empire and the end of Roman rule) provide a major and valuable narrative feature that justifies the new title. Its predecessor was something for an enquirer to take off the shelf with hope, returning it without disap- pointment; the new version joins that class. As to the Empire as a whole, cheers greet F. Millar, Government, Society, and Culture in the Roman Empire,8 the second volume of a triple-decker. Those who have read the essays one by one will be happy to have them for reference, those who have not (university students and general readers wanting insight into later twentieth-century developments in the subject) are lucky to have them available all at once. The first eleven are on imperial government, the last nine on society and culture. Even at the reasonable price purchasers will want to know how easily these classic papers, ranging from 1963 to 2002, can be had. A dozen come from the Journal of Roman Studies: the younger a subscriber is, the more he or she needs the volume; and there are seven items from foreign publications. It is odd to call the papers 'Chapters', but the work's value is much greater than that of their sum. The hard core of Roman society was the family, and it has been getting the attention it deserves. Invidious as it is to single out names, it would be unjust not to mention Beryl Rawson, and the work edited by M. George, The Roman Family in the Empire,9 is dedicated to her. Indeed, 'this volume follows from the three Australian conferences begun by her in 1981', though itself stemming from one held in McMaster University. Its participants carried the study further afield than before, and both individual contributions and the book as a whole offer rich food for thought, because of diverse material available from different parts of the Empire. There is a temptation to accumulate 'facts', but several authors deal with methodology and the celebrated treatment of R. P. Saller and B. D. Shaw.10 The editor, though content to talk of an urban Italian middle class, has pertinent questions about what makes up 'the family', which is reviewed again in the Egyptian essay, with nice criticism of 7 The Roman Government of Britain.

As to range, the first four papers concern Rome and Italy (Cicero, family values, the child in sickness and health) and the Justinianic law code; we go then to Egypt and Judaea (for careful distinction of behaviour between classes), then wing dizzily west to Lusitania and to 'the Roman North-West' ('how things must have been'); then south to Africa and finally the Pannonian outback, well illustrated. The absence of Greece and especially Asia Minor is painfully marked, but this is a beginning and the methods of the present authors will be developed for other regions. Drinking marks either end of this review; between cappuccino and Caecuban, readers might welcome a square meal. The American Journal of Philology offers Roman Dining,11 a special issue dedicated to the memory of J. H. D'Arms and largely based on papers presented at a panel sponsored by the APA and AIA in 2002. N. Purcell's 'The way we used to eat', dealing with the history not of food but of Roman food mentalitis, healthily demands re-jigging of the brain; J. Wilkins' 'Land and Sea' widens the area of enquiry; M. Roller, on 'Horizontal Women' leisurely undoes Roman claims that women 'used to' sit to eat; J. F. Donahue applies French commensality categories to Roman dining; and K. M. D. Dunbabin assembles well-illustrated evidence on 'The waiting servant in Later Roman Art' (deviating from the dining table). But the large subject has reached a point where interdisciplinary (ix) forking at aspects of it makes unity hard to achieve, especially when the number of papers is so limited and familiar items may be explained in mediis rebus. One could hardly be further from our starting point than with R. A. Kaster's 'expedition in cultural psychology', Emotion, Restraint, and Community in Ancient Rome,12 but nothing is what it seems. First, the title envelops more than the content, softening it. The author deals with a few basic Latin social bricks: pudor, verecundia, paenitentia, invidia, fastidium; an epilogue, 'Being "wholly" Roman', handles integritas. The author would complain of this formulation: he eschews a lexical approach. He is concerned with dynamics, naturally different from those of the 'corresponding' English. For each word he sets up a branching set of 'scripts' showing how they are used on various occasions, for example pudor arising in circumstances which are/are not 'up to me'. These sets are brought into relation with each other, creating a deep and extensive system which goes some way towards justifying the title. The unravelling of integritas is particularly striking. Notwithstanding typographical slips, jokes that will grow old, and the strained use of 'face', the whole book is insightful and practical (there is a vital index of ancient authors and works and rich explanatory notes)-and is an engaging page-turner. Now to a single ancient author. S. P. Oakley approaches the end of his massive underpinning of Roman Republican history with the third volume of his Commentary on Livy Books VI-X.13 With the present volume, and its near-twin on Book 10, the author has been dealing with material on Roman institutions that is 'much more reliable, or possibly more reliable' and has elicited much modern discussion; his principle has been to help the reader with his own investigations by citing earlier treatments. Hence the weight of the volume and, in part, the gap " Roman Dining. A special issue of American Journal of Philology. Edited by Barbara K. Gold and John F. Donahue.

Flavius. Between them it takes in the resonant activities of Claudius the Censor, as well as the digression on Alexander. Oakley's introductory remarks, before the line-by-line commentary, are divided into sections: 'Livy's version', 'Parallel narratives' (for the last two-thirds he gives Diodorus Siculus in full), 'Literary analysis' and 'Historical analysis', and that is very helpful to the reader. 'Further conjectures' and 'Further interpretations' are gathered into Appendices that also deal with settlement and the origins of the annalistic portrait of the Claudii. Oakley's own photographs illustrate the text and the maps are excellent. Any student of Livy's writing or of later fourth century Rome and far beyond will need this book to hand. To end, more books for students. G. Jennison's *Animals for Show and Pleasure in Ancient Rome15 is reissued with coloured covers and the same, quaint-looking, text inside, its notes down the margins. Sadly, Jennison did not live to enjoy the success of his book, which has been on library shelves ever since. It was well reviewed when it appeared; the Journal of Roman Studies16 said that the book provided 'a wealth of curious and inter- esting information' and was suitable for 'biologist, historian, antiquarian, or intelligent general reader'. Noting Jennison's position as Superintendant of Belle Vue Zoo, B. W. Tucker stressed an admirable combination of practical experience and sound scholarship, though he jibbed at some identifications (musk ox and orang utan). In case readers have not encountered the book before, Jennison, after two chapters devoted to Greek city-states and Ptolemaic Egypt, passes to the Roman games, Republic, early and late Empire. Then three chapters on menageries provide relief, before he returns to practicalities: capture and transport, development of the arena, provincial amphitheatres, stockyards, and shows. The work is based on ancient writers, and stands up well when the sources do; chapters with an archaeological component will have been overtaken by more recent work, and the pictures have not worn well; other, more sophisticated, works are cited at the end of relevant articles in the Oxford Classical Dictionary; but we must be grateful to the publishers for making it possible to replace those tattered copies. Finally two books in series. His publishers have not served J. Malitz' Nero17 well. Their blurb announces a 'fascinating new biography', outlining 'often forgotten' aspects, Nero's early political agenda, his initial popularity, and doing no justice to existing works. This translation of a German book of 1999 is unstylish and once or twice flummoxing: in Nero's deadly ship a beam 'would fall on the unassuming Agrippina'. Worst, the biography stops at p. 114 and we have an appendix: 'Suetonius ... Nero [extracts]. ... Philadelphia. Gebbie &amp; Co. 1889', with 'Remarks on Nero' 157-62, all in the language of its time and including a lengthy passage quoted in the main text (in a different translation).

(Nero, as the author points out, threatens to retire to Rhodes, but why Rhodes, if not in emulation of the high-principled constitutionalist Tiberius? There were issues at stake.) In spite of stemma, 'timeline', map of the Empire, adequate illustrations, brief bibliography, and index, the hardback at least is over-priced. S. Burstein's equally attractive-looking *The Reign of Cleopatral8 tackles a subject both inflammatory and haphazardly documented. Following the series pattern, he takes the only possible course: treating it in short segments. Hence mixed impres- sions. We have a Chronology, a basic narrative of Ptolemaic Egypt (Burstein goes beyond the boundaries of his title), and of Cleopatra herself; then thirty pages on how the country worked, multiculturalism, and Alexandria, its culture and conflicts. There is much for the student here. The concluding chapter, 'Queen and symbol', attempts a contrast between conventional views and Burstein's own view, but it is not very clear, and the page on 'black' Cleopatras seems timorous and unfocused. Burstein then offers sketches of sixteen prominent persons, including deities (repetition was inevitable). Sixty-one pages of translated documents follow (largely Caesar, Plutarch, papyri), some from ancient Loebs ('But if thou dost not like the thing .. .'); next a helpful glossary and bibliography, with critical comments; finally a sprinkle of notes. The book serves a purpose, including helping 'student research', but it is not as tightly built, nor as well written, as it should be. Perhaps there may be a second edition.

Art and Archaeology Between the end of 2003 and early 2005, museum-goers were subjected to a shocking experience. It was a travelling exhibition hosted in Munich, Copenhagen, and the Vatican. The purpose of the show was to make clear to the general public a feature of ancient art often overlooked: namely, the fact that Greek and Roman sculpture was originally painted - moreover, it is evident, painted in extremely bright or 'loud' colours. Anyone who did not suffer the direct trauma of seeing a cast of the Prima Porta Augustus arrayed in red and blue, complete with cinnabar hair and scarlet lips, is now obliged to seek out the volume of essays now published on behalf of the Vatican Museums, entitled I colori del bianco.1 The paradox embedded in that title is eloquent enough: we generally see Classical statues as shiny white objects, and easily forget (if we were ever aware) the polychrome gaudiness these statues once possessed. J. J. Winckelmann is often reckoned as the authority who in the late eighteenth century 'canonized' the notion that the surface of ancient marble was finished to a cold, translucent white, compounding his aesthetic regard for the 'noble simplicity' achieved by Praxiteles et al.

The production of Neo-Classical statuary by the likes of Canova and Thorvaldsen only confirmed the habit. This meant that when the French antiquarian Quatremere de Quincy surmised, on the basis of ancient texts, that colour had once been used on Classical sculpture, his theory (published in Le Jupiter Olympien, 1814) seemed radically 'nouveau'. But archaeologists were at least alerted to the precaution of examining newly-excavated finds for traces of pigment prior to having them cleaned; and throughout the nineteenth century, the evidence of ancient paintwork accumulated. The Prima Porta Augustus, discovered in 1863, might be explained as some Roman elaboration of the Classical ideal. But watercolour studies of the korai recovered from the Athenian Akropolis in the mid-1880s made it undeniably clear that the precedents for bright colouring were established in the Archaic period. Even the pedimental ensembles of the Parthenon were allowed to carry traces of 'Pheidian brushstrokes' - and were originally placed, it was conceded, in an architectural structure that was itself throbbing with rich hues. Over a century later, however, the knowledge of coloured originals remains something of a distasteful secret. So it is that the various scholars contributing to this collection of essays and case-studies regarding ancient polychromy are united by a somewhat polemical zeal for setting the record straight. In a sense, it ought to be easy enough to persuade us that sculpture is improved by colour: after all, our most popular painters today - Van Gogh and the Impres- sionists-are those who were unrestrained about using colour to express form. But there is no doubt that we nevertheless find it difficult to sympathize with the aesthetic effects created by reapplying polychromy to casts of Classical sculpture. And beyond that, there remain some doubts regarding the norms of ancient practice. If a marble surface were regularly overlaid with pigment - so that even a nude Venus would be covered in a 'glaze' of white lead - why do Greek and Roman poets like to apostro- phize the purity of Parian marble as a likeness to the complexion of a desirable female? And if, as it is argued, bronze statues were also painted, then why might certain facial components - such as lips - be crafted out of different metals, such as copper? For that matter, why go to the trouble of finding glass paste for inlaid eyes? The literature of ancient appreciation for the materials of sculpture is sufficient to indicate that the substance of a statue was important in the eyes of viewers: not only gold and ivory in the case of chryselephantine statues, but marble preferred to other stones, and certain quarry-sources of marble held in particular esteem. Such esteem could only flourish if at least some sculpture were once displayed as Winckelmann would have wished - unadorned by paint. Another exhibition has left its mark on our understanding of the practicalities of Classical art. At its centre was a tattered piece of papyrus - not much, on the face of it, to excite public attention. But the impresarios of this show at Turin's Palazzo Bricherasio in the spring of 2006 ingeniously gathered around the papyrus a collection of related artifacts which made for an illuminating visit, whose didactic value is perpetuated by the accompanying catalogue, Le tre vite del Papiro di Artemidoro.2 If the papyrus looks battered and torn, it has a right to do so, for it was first used (in late Ptolemaic Alexandria) to transcribe some of the geographical treatises of Artemidorus of Ephesus - a major source for 2 Le tre vite del Papiro di Artemidoro.

This map was never finished; and so the parchment ended up not in a library, but in some artist's workshop, as potentially useful scrap material. Here the verso became a sort of sketchbook: first exploited to assemble a graphic menagerie of animals, ranging from the exotic (giraffes, flamingos) to the fabulous (a gryphon), which may have been used as a repertory for mosaic-makers and their patrons. Subsequently, remaining spaces on recto side of the papyrus were evidently used for apprentice draughtsmanship - studies of heads, hands and feet, probably made from plaster cast models. 'It was a tremendous moment in the history of art when, perhaps a little before 500 B.C., artists dared for the first time in all history to paint a foot as seen from in front.' This judgement, from E. H. Gombrich's The Story of Art, serves to invest the Artemidorus papyrus with its art-historical importance. Absolute first evidence of a foreshortened foot does indeed come from early Athenian red-figured vase-painting, in the output of the so-called 'Pioneers' - Euthymides, Euphronios et al. But here in Graeco-Roman Egypt we find confirmation of the entire Classical ideal of what artists should be trained to do. Anyone who has tried representing the human form in two dimensions knows very well that hands and feet are difficult parts of the body to 'get right', especially when foreshortened. It takes practice. 'Draw, draw, and don't waste time', as Michelangelo chided one of his pupils. One can almost hear the same advice echoing from this precious relic in Turin. If we had the 'notebooks' of Pheidias, no doubt those too would be filled with similar exercises. But about Pheidias and the methods of his art we are destitute of any direct evidence-beyond the marvellous end result. Intu- itively, we recognize that the coalition of Pheidias and Perikles in mid-fifth century Athens was a coming-together of time, place, and personality that proved extraordi- narily productive. Plutarch probably relied on more than intuition to inform his evocation of a 'dream-team' at work on the Athenian Akropolis - but as to the programmatic meaning of what these masterminds devised, we can only speculate. And inevitably, when we speculate, there is the temptation to construct some 'spirit of the age', or Zeitgeist, which might in turn provide telepathic access to the thoughts and intentions of Pheidias. Such historical method is usually associated with Hegel and the nineteenth century. But it was in 1972 that Jerome Pollitt of Yale University presented his version of it, in a book which has been steadily used by undergraduates ever since. Pollitt's Art and Experience in Classical Greece set out to explore 'some of the basic cultural experiences which the arts were used to express' in the Classical period. So Pheidias, for Pollitt, joins Sophocles in giving 'witnessable form' to the ideology of Perikles (primarily as voiced in his Funeral Oration). Now a festschrift for Pollitt, Periklean Athens and its Legacy,3 pays tribute to Pollitt's influence in refocusing scholarly attention upon the cultural history of Greek (and Hellenistic) art, and departing from the sort of analysis of formal style favoured by, for example, Rhys Carpenter (to name its most eloquent exponent). There are several stimulating contributions to this honorific volume, making appropriate links between Athenian imagery and Athenian politics, rhetoric, literature, and cult practice. But a concluding essay, composed as an appraisal of the impact and influence (for better or worse) of Pollitt's Art and Experience, inadvertently highlights the generic risks of all attempts to define the 'temper' of an 'epoch', or Hegelian 'Spirit of the Age'.

Only one of them, however, is by an English scholar; and she is not only of an older generation but has spent many years of her working life in the United States. This absence is of course in a sense fortu- itous; but may also prompt one to reflect on David Martin's question in his recent On Secularization: Towards a revised general theory (2005): with the advance of a consumer ethos mainly interested in measurable utility, are the universities in Britain ceasing to be bases for a diffuse humanism? Corinne Pache (now at Yale), who is already known for her translation of Nicole Loraux' Les mires en deuil (1998), was alerted to the potential interest as a dissertation topic of a neglected area, hero-cults of (small) children. Despite the considerable attention devoted lately to the cults of (adult) heroes, most people would indeed be hard put to name even one such cult apart from Mermeros and Pheres, the sons of Medea, at Corinth, of Melikertes-Palaimon at the Isthmus nearby, and Pelops at Olympia.1 In order to give the book some argumen- tative coherence, she has however been rather selective. One will find no reference here to the 'boy kings' of Amphissa identified with the Dioscuri, and later with the Cabiri (Paus. 10.38.7), nor to the sons of Trophonius at his oracle-site at Lebadeia (Paus. 9.39.5), nor to Patreus and his two sons at Patrae, all three represented as young boys (Paus. 8.20.7), nor even to Sosipolis at Olympia, the mysterious baby who metamorphosed into a snake and saved the Eleans from the Arcadians (Paus. 6.20.4f.). Instead, Pache concentrates on seven relatively well-known mythic cases of pre-pubertal children, usually killed by some form of transgressive violence, who received posthumous cult as heroes: the children of Medea and Heracles (victims of their own parents' violence), Linus and Demophon (failed immortalization), and the three cults associated with pan-hellenic games, Pelops, Melikertes-Palaemon, and Opheltes-Arcemorus at Nemea. These are, I think, tacitly understood by her as the three major modes of child-heroization. She rightly sees Brelich's Gli eroi greci (1958) as a decisive break with the older discourses of biothanatoi (Pfister), chthonic powers aligned with the Cabiri (Nilsson, Griechische Feste, p. 213: not cited by Pache), or cults of a mother-goddess with two children (W. R. Halliday: again not cited by her), and inclines to favour his model of initiation-rite. One of her main concerns, in the manner established by Franz Brommer and Timothy Gantz, is to combine literary 1 Baby and Child Heroes in Ancient Greece. By Corinne Ondine Pache.

Her main discussions are however solid and interesting, full of good sense and adroit use of analogy and parallel; those of Medea's children (note her criticisms of Christiane Sourvinou-Inwood, p. 41f.), and of Opheltes and Melikertes are of particular value. I would also draw attention to her remarks on the way mythic narratives ritualize child-deaths in terms of hunting, war and sacrifice (p. 65); on the motifs of picking-flowers (p. 99) and singing lullabies (p. 107f.); the establishment of games as compensation for death (p. 133); and on how death in these cases confers beauty, immortality and significance (p. 155). One or two criticisms ought to be made, however. Pache never sets out clearly the rationale behind her decision to omit a number of cases of child-heroes, or analogous cults such as the Athenian Tritopatreus (Cicero, ND 3.53), some of which I have mentioned above. Nor does she attempt a general sketch of the ideological values of childhood in Greek society and cult (she was unable to consult Jeannine Uzzi's inter- esting Children in the Visual Arts of Imperial Rome [2005]), let alone tackle the possible relation between high rates of child mortality, infant exposure (especially of girls) and maternal peri-natal death, on the one hand, and the phenomenon of child-heroization on the other. She inclines instead to psychologize and domesticate the motif of child-killing by referring to the mundane fears of ordinary parents; she actually claims that the story of Medea is 'a representation of a parent's darkest fears' (p. 9). Such suburban cliches have no place in the discussion of myth-narratives, any more than the claim that the myths are interested in drawing attention to the multifarious dangers to small children from 'community, relatives, parents' (p. 181). Although she notes the pattern whereby dead children re-appear in cult as youths, she makes no attempt to explain it (p. 154f.). She oddly views failed immortalization as the metaphorical expression of the ordeal (athletic competition) that worshippers underwent in celebrating hero-cults (p. 83). On a more trivial level, though the book is well-produced, nicely illustrated and carefully proof-read, the index is poor - one will not, for example, find the name Kothos there, though the story is discussed on p. 45f.; likewise Kaphyai (p. 22f.). Yet fleeting references to scholars, Jebb or Kirk or Kassel, are faithfully and pointlessly listed. All in all, though, a worthwhile study. It is common nowadays to claim that accounts of Greek religion in general are virtually impossible to write, especially at an introductory level, so that one must study Athens more or less in isolation. All that is meant by this, however, is that it is difficult to find sufficient evidence to write a study centred on a single polis, in keeping with the dominant model of 'polis-religion'. It is therefore extremely welcome that Joannis Mylonopoulos (now at Erfurt), already known from his work on the great Heidelberg bibliography of Roman social and religious history (J.-U. Krause et al. 1998), has tackled the subject of the cult of Poseidon in the Peloponnese.2 It is familiar that the peninsula was always one of the main centres of the cult of this 2 Peloponnesos oikiterion Poseidonos.

The sanctuary at the Isthmus, already in the eleventh century BC the most important sacral meeting-place of post-Mycenaean Corinth, is among the very earliest known religious archaeological sites of Greece; Aegae and Helice (destroyed in 373/2 BC) were already famous centres of the cult in Homeric times. Other important sites were the Amphictyonic centre on the island of Kalaureia, now Poros, which offered secure asylum (Paus. 2.33.2), the entrance to the Underworld at the tip of Cape Taenarum in Laconia (Paus. 3.25.4f.), and the shrine of Poseidon Hippios outside Mantineia, rebuilt by Hadrian close to the hippodrome (Paus. 8.10.1). This is in many ways a model study, an example of the type of painstaking work that urgently needs to be done, for cults of other deities, and for other areas of Greece and of Greek colonization. The essential requirement is an intimate knowledge of the relevant archaeology: Mylonopoulos describes each site in detail, complete with maps and ground-plans, and works over la longue dureie, from Mycenaean times to Theodosius. It thus emerges that it was the Archaic period that saw the most rapid expansion of cult-places. Later foundations, such as the temple of Hipposthenes and Poseidon at Sparta, or of Poseidon Epoptes at Megalopolis, seem to have occurred only sporadi- cally and under pressure of special circumstances. Yet almost everywhere investment in buildings was relatively low. The archaeological catalogue and analysis of the locations, intra- and extra-urban, of temples and sanctuaries, occupies more than half the book (some 260 pages); much of the remainder deals with festivals, types of sacrifice, votive-types (mainly animal figurines except at Penteskouphia), and objects and animals sacred to the god. The next three, much briefer, chapters focus upon aspects of the deity himself: cult-epithets (here almost exclusively connected with horses and earth-movements), areas of intervention (again mainly earthquakes and horse-raising; the cult of maritime Poseidon is mainly of imperial date), and links with other deities, especially Athena and Aphrodite, and in Arcadia Demeter. The final chapter discusses Poseidon as poliadic deity (probably of six cities, though only Mantineia and Troezen are confirmed by literary sources) and as the main cult-figure of loosely organized local leagues (amphictyonies). Oddly enough, in no case was a temple to poliadic Poseidon built on an acropolis. There are no exciting new theories here - and surely we have had enough of those in relation to Poseidon, earthquakes, and horses - but solid, useful work, all the more striking in that this is not a Habili- tation but a PhD thesis. Sally Humphreys has for many years brought a distinctively anthropological point of view to bear on her work on the ancient Greeks: one remembers, from her first collection, Anthropology and the Greeks (1978), the accounts of the social structure of the polis, and of the evolution of social differenti- ation, with its use of Basil Bernstein's notion of communicative codes; and from The Family, Women and Death (1983, 1993), the studies on Greek kinship, and on death and time, all at that time innovative themes. Her new collection is written in the same spirit, though the specifically anthropological perspective has largely given way to an informed discursiveness apparently absorbed unconsciously from Arnaldo Momigliano, combined with an almost oppressive familiarity with modern American intellectual trends (she worked for many years at the University of Chicago).3 Despite its title, this is not a book that can be compared with Robert Parker's two recent volumes on Athenian religion: it consists of essays on rather disparate topics, in 3 The Strangeness of Gods.

One of these (chap. 5) is evidently older, however, since it too, like nos. 1-3, is provided with an Afterword containing fresh reflections, more recent bibliography, and self-criticism. Nominally, at any rate, the book is composed of chapters devoted alternately to analysis of discourse, and analysis of data thus 'constructed'. To simplify extremely her general aim, one might say that she opposes the dominant pragmatic paradigm in the study of Greek religion (viz. that "Greek religion is centred on ritual practice, essentially blood-sacrifice") by insisting on the continuing importance of 'theological' reflection: efforts expressed in literature, especially poetry, to modify and ameliorate popular belief, and the general importance of a complex Athenian discourse about religious affairs and meanings. This in turn involves questioning conventional modern views of the differences between fundamental categories such as 'religion', 'philos- ophy', 'literature' and so on, and the revalorization of the role of allegory. This argument is both valuable and important as a corrective to the dominant Anglo-American view (which is, however, much less prevalent on the Continent), and had her book contributed directly to this theme-which emerges directly from her long-standing pre-occupation with the opposition between the immanent and the transcendent - in relation to Athens, we could have welcomed it unreservedly. Unfor- tunately too many other topics come crowding in, and the reader for long stretches loses sight of what ought to have been a sustained argument. As it is, the two longest and most detailed, and new, pieces, on the cults of the demes (ch. 4) and on the Anthesteria (ch. 6), do attempt to exemplify what she is getting at, by offering a history of the supposed long-term changes in these cults, unfortunately on the basis of evidence that is inevitably inadequate to the laudable intention. The other detailed piece republishes her old 1985 essay on what is presented as the religious 'programme' of Lycurgus, which has now been largely superseded by the work of others, who have shown, for example, that many of his views or claims relating to religion were perfectly conventional in his day and can easily be paralleled in other orators. The first chapter, on desirable reading-strategies and modern receptions of antiquity, written in Foucauldian spirit, is in some ways the freshest: it need disturb no one that it has very little to do with the main argument. Un pot-pourri, then, engaged and reflective; but it would have been better if Humphreys had been prepared to tackle her main issues directly at the middle range, neither zooming here up so high, nor focusing there so intently on minutiae. There could have been a middle way. Just such a middle path is taken by Ilias Arnaoutoglou (who has previously published a reader of Greek legal texts [1998] and formerly worked for the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names in Oxford) in his dissertation, directed by D. M. MacDowell at Glasgow, on private religious associations in Hellenistic Athens.4 Discontented with the dominant model of Athenian religion, which operates with a largely unmediated dichotomy between 'public' and 'private', between the citizen and the banqueter or symposiast, he found what seemed a promising bridge in the private association, whose potential importance has, until the recent work of N. F. Jones, The Associations of Classical Athens (1999), been largely lost sight of in the years since the pioneering publications of P. Foucart, E. Ziebarth, F. Poland and M. San Nicolo.

Ferguson's moralizing view - itself by then traditional in the field - that private associations were essentially foreign and vulgar. Arnaoutoglou argues that private cult associations may well have existed much earlier than the fourth century, particularly attached to local and rural shrines, but that nothing is known about them until the later fourth-century extension of epigraphic culture, and an increase in available funds, led to an upsurge in inscrip- tions. He also rightly argues that it is illegitimate to use material from later periods, the Roman Empire in particular, to supplement gaps in the late-Classical/Hellenistic evidence, since private associations are so heavily implicated in local interests and contexts. As a result, we may well be able to pose sophisticated questions, but in many cases they simply cannot be tackled. This is not to imply that he limits himself to mere description, though his Appendix 1 lists 175 epigraphic texts (which need to be taken with the differently-conceived lists of R. L. Garland and J. D. Mikalson) as his basic material, and his chs. 2-3 provide a clearly-presented overview of organization, showing, for example, that there are no exclusively foreign associations, and stressing how closely they model themselves on the wider politico-legal habits of the polis (the influence of 0. van Nijf will be clear). Finally, in ch. 4, he argues that the euergetic model only penetrated Hellenistic private religious associations to a limited extent, and that the concepts of patron-client relations and of marginality are of little use in understanding them; but that associations effected a form of long-term value-social- ization based upon the desire for distinction in Bourdieu's sense. This is a sober and useful piece of socio-religious history that deserves to be more widely known than it probably will be, in view of its place and form of publication. We may now turn to myth, which has arrived at a pedagogical status that would have been impossible to imagine forty years ago. Messrs Trzaskoma, Smith, and Burnett, all at the University of New Hampshire, have produced a well-structured, practical, and inexpensive reader of translated extracts for class-room use with students who need possess no prior knowledge of the ancient world.5 It consists, in the manner made popular by the classic textbook of R. J. Lenardon and M. P. O. Morford, Classical Mythology, now in its 7th edition (2003) and ever more costly, entirely of extracts from more than fifty classical authors, arranged in alphabetical order from Acusilaus to Xenophon, and freshly translated by themselves. In order to cut down the bulk, and to leave space for lesser-known names such as Palaephatus, Cleanthes, Conon or Fulgentius, they have omitted Homer, Greek tragedy, Apollonius Rhodius, and virtually all Roman material, apart from a bit of Lucretius and Vergil, Aeneid books 2 and 6, all easily available in translation elsewhere; Apollodorus is savagely cut, and the mythical sections of Diodorus Siculus hardly represented; however, the entire Theogony and an effective selection from WD and the Homeric Hymns are included. The translations are straightforward, and range widely in style, from sub-Lattimore (Hymns - in prose) to New Hampshire camp (Lucian). The book emerges from their own teaching experience, and is designed to supplement teaching of Homer or Ovid's Metamor- phoses, or even a class working with, say, Lenardon &amp; Morford. They also envisage it being used to prepare students for looking at Greek mythological vases or other archaeological materials. The index is intended to make it possible to use the book as 5 Anthology of Classical Myth. Primary sources in translation. Edited with introductions and notes by Stephen M. Trzaskoma, R.

Apart from underlining the fundamental fact of unlimited narrative variation and transformation, the aim is to suggest the variety of literary forms and modes in which Greek myth was mediated, and thus some of the generic possibilities and closures so effected. The volume is furnished with useful supplementary material, hints to students and teachers, maps, genealogies, chronol- ogies of authors and texts, one or two inscriptions including the Hymn to the Kouros, and one or two extracts from the magical papyri, all of which evidence a desire to move away from a narrow, i.e. literary, view of myth. The same desire is suggested by the inclusion of a short section devoted to gods and offerings in Linear B tablets by T. G. Palaima. Despite the absence of a supplementary reading-list, the book is a real alternative to other similar textbooks, so long as the teacher is prepared to put in some thought about how best to adapt it to his or her local requirements. As I mentioned, the role of allegory in sustaining the cognitive viability of Greek religious thinking is one of Sally Humphreys' major themes. The appearance of an English translation by Catherine Tihanyi of Luc Brisson's ten-year-old tour de force on the 'rationalization' and re-working of myth by thinkers, then philosophers, from the fifth century BC to the Late Renaissance, may therefore please her.6 Brisson, however, who is a directeur d'6tudes at the CNRS in Paris, is interested in a rather later, and highly specialized, version of Humphreys' 'internal' allegorizing. His project, as is evident from the provocative title, is to demonstrate the illusoriness in the long term of the supposed dichotomy between mythical and philosophical thinking under discussion in the later writings of Louis Gernet, and in J.-P. Vernant's essays 'Du mythe a la raison' and 'La formation de la pensee positive dans la Grace archaique' in Mythe et pens&amp;e (1965). Already in the Derveni papyrus (written c. 340-20 BC, but apparently a 'living' text) we can find an advanced and inventive set of techniques (including etymologization and probable citation of Anaximander and Diogenes of Apollonia) for re-writing, and so in a sense saving, an earlier cosmology, through the device of insisting upon a correct grasp of the author's hyponoia. Plato's elevation of logos over mythos, argument over narrative, verifiability over unverifiability, and his correlative elevation of the philosopher's role as hermeneutic policeman, are seen as mere distractions in the course of the development of an alliance, traceable in Aristotle, the Stoics, and Euhemerists alike, between philosophy and myth, increasingly seen not as 'false' but as a transcription of primitive wisdom about God. The movement becomes full-fledged in Middle- and Neo-Platonism: ch. 5 is about the emergence of the new term allegoria for this process of re-writing, and of an alternative, ainigma, evoked from forms of signification current in initiations into mysteries; this development is seen as a response to Epicurean and Academic attacks on these reading strategies; ch. 6 takes on Athenian Neo-Platonism, which involved reading Plato through Orpheus (esp. the Rhapsodies), Homer, Hesiod, Pythagoras, and the Chaldaean Oracles. The three final chapters hurry through the following millennium up to the late Renaissance, stressing the ingenuity with which a priori meanings could be imposed on, or read into, earlier texts, in particular Christian ones. To fit all this into a slim book, Brisson has to move at a great rate, and, gifted though he is at exposition, the reader is often lost in a welter of names and ideas, especially towards the end - 6 How Philosophers saved Myths.

Brisson's maitres were Jean Pepin and Felix Buffiere, the great French scholars of allegory, whom he often cites (the book is dedicated to Pepin); the work of anglophone scholars who have covered part of the same field is largely ignored, though Robert Lamberton's excellent Homer the Theologian (1986) is cited twice. The translation is careful and fluent, but, I found, somewhat dry - in keeping with the style of the original. Nor has any attempt been made to accommodate anglophone readers, though the author has made one or two changes, and corrected some details. Despite these minor problems, the publishers are to be thanked for making available in English a book on an important aspect of the history of myth commonly ignored, or depreciated because it fails to correspond to what we expect of 'Greek myth'. Finally, another translation of a book in French from an American academic press, Philippe Borgeaud's La Mire des dieux: De Cybele a la Vibrge Marie, also ten years old, permits a quick passage to Rome.7 For Borgeaud, who is Jean Rudhardt's successor at Geneva, the cult of the Anatolian Mother, so far from being deeply exotic and 'other', was itself, even in Mermnedan Lydia, heavily influenced by Greek conceptions of Mother Earth during the Archaic period. What came to be imported into Ionia, Chios, Laconia, Magna Graecia, Massilia and elsewhere in that period was a deity in a sense already familiar and easily assimilated. Once received, she functions as the domestic Other, comparable in some ways to the cases of Dionysus, and Pan. In democratic Athens, for example, her shrine, the Metroon, The House of the Mother = Gaia/Rhea/Demeter, built (he suggests) at around the same time as the rebuilding of the bouleuterion in the late fifth century BC, was the official location of the city's archives. The oddity of such a female presence in the male democracy was marked by stressing, and elaborating, specifically Phrygian features of the cult of Cybele: the Mother becomes two divinities (a large proportion of the Classical figurines are double), domestic and foreign. In Rome, something similar occurs: as 'Trojan' (the Idaean Mother), Cybele can be considered Roman; but the famous black meteorite came not from the Aeolid but from Pessinus in Galatia; hence the name of the galli, the castrated servants of divinity, whose exoticism guaranteed the (false) exoticism of the cult as a whole. Borgeaud develops at length a fairly convincing 'structuralist' account of the Attis-myths (in the introduction to the trans- lation, he maintains his view of a Graeco-Roman Attis against Maria Gracia Lancellotti's more recent Phrygian one), such that the theme of continence and chastity become a leit-motif of the second part of the book, themes that fed directly into Christian models of purity. In passing, he convincingly shows (pp. 116-19), after Rutter, the spuriousness of the famous account of the taurobolium by Prudentius, and of its pendant, the fossa sanguinis. It surely is time that this old chestnut ceased to be circulated as a 'fact'; but some errors never die. Borgeaud has thus given an old idea, the domestic Other, new vigour, and pursued its implications in many subtle explora- tions of familiar materials. It must however be said that he writes in a rather mannered, even elusive fashion, the reader being left to make what he or she can of it. On the other hand, since the material is exceedingly complex, even contradictory, it might be argued that too much direct assertion should be avoided.

There is too rather a large number of oddities, such as 'Achaemenidian', 'Pasargad', 'Dactyli', Bacchantes as the title of Euripides' play. More generally on the production side, the Johns Hopkins Press has made none of the desirable improvements to the poor-quality French original: there are still no maps or plans; the Greek is all trans- literated, even when inscriptions are cited; there is no consolidated bibliography, nowadays surely an indispensable amenity to the reader; and, worst of all, in a book full of references to archaeological materials, there is not a single illustration. M. J. Vermaseren's Cybele and Attis (1977) was certainly a less good book, but it at least provided the reader with the visual stimuli without which writing can easily become mere words. doi: 10.10.1017/S0017383506000362 RICHARD GORDON General We start with a trio of books on which to feast the eyes. Antiquity and Photographyl was published to accompany an exhibition at the Getty Villa in Malibu, the subject of which was early photographs of archaeological sites. The exhibition and the book celebrate the contribution made by photography to the study of the distant past. While this may seem at first an implausible relationship, on reflection the potential of photography was obvious - in part as a form of accurate documentation, but no less importantly as an immediate and compelling means of inspiring generations with interest in a world that was distant both in space and in time. Nothing can beat the excitement of actually 'being there' on site in the geographical setting itself, but good photography can help to bridge the miles, just as this book can act as a substitute for those of us who could not make it to Malibu for the exhibition. The photographs themselves are of variable quality, naturally enough given their extreme age, but this is no obstacle to our enjoying fascinating glimpses into a two-layered history, that of the archaeological remains themselves and that of the intrepid explorers who set out to find and record the classical past, incongruously dressed in their Sunday best in precarious and uncomfortable conditions. The other two picture books form a duo in their own right in the 'Unfolding History' series. Great Monuments of the Ancient World2 and Castles, Fortresses and Citadels.3 The former offers a wealth of detailed and high-quality photographs of ancient sites covering a huge time span and stretching from South America to India. Sites such as Stonehenge, Ur, and the pyramids of Giza lead us on to more strictly Classical territory - Mycenae, the Athenian acropolis, Petra, and Pompeii, before the tour swings off to Machu Piccu and the like. The array might seem to lack unity; indeed in historical and architectural 1 Antiquity &amp; Photography. Early Views of Ancient Mediterranean Sites. By Claire L. Lyons, John K.

It is simply a roll-call of twenty-nine famous and spectacular examples of stunning design and technological expertise. However, this in itself gives the book some coherence, together with the uniform format of a pair of photographs of each site opening up to yield a magnificent large aerial view. If nothing else it is testimony to the amazing endurance of some of the boldest building projects ever undertaken by man in the days when quality counted for something and slave-labour kept the costs down. The second of these books ranges from the Great Wall of China to Carcassonne and the Tower of London, via Masada and Aleppo, covering a particular type of monumental architecture, designed above all to protect and to inspire a sense of strength in conflict. Castles, Fortresses and Citadels is naturally unified by the common theme of defence in conflicts through history. There must surely be a certain poignancy in the fact that one of the sites featured, Dubrovnik, has had to rely so recently on its ancient fortifications for the survival of its citizens. From buildings to the building-blocks of the ancient languages. It is good to see the appearance of a new edition of *Bradley's Arnold Latin Prose Composition.4 Mountford's edition bears all the strengths of the old version, which has stood the test of time in introducing students to both the main constructions in Latin and many of the more obscure points also. However, the format has been greatly improved and this version is much more user-friendly for the language-shy. Although the direction of the work, as its title suggests, has always been towards prose composition, the clearly set out syntax and helpful practice exercises at the end of each section mean that the book will prove helpful to students engaged in the full range of language-learning activities. It is worth noting also that those who prefer to learn their Latin aurally can do so using Readings from Wheelock's Latin, 5 a 4-CD set containing readings of all the paradigms, vocabularies, and sententiae antiquae from the forty chapters, together with all the reading passages. For those learning at distance or independently, this should prove a very helpful resource. Next we should simply note the appearance of a host of foreign publications on thematic issues. For those with Italian, the wonderful Laterza press has produced a general guide to the ancient theatre. Il teatro antico6 whirls its readers from Aeschylus to Seneca with comment on all the major extant theatrical works of Greece and Rome and prefaced by some introductory comments on issues such as the chorus and the religious dimension: at ?24 it is a bargain. More clearly designed for the specialist is L'equilibrio internazionale dagli antichi ai moderni,7 an even more reasonably priced volume with a distinguished list of contributors, who tackle and explore a series of ancient and modern historical situations in which political, ideological, and cultural balances have been achieved. Each contribution deserves a review in its own right - the ancient ones cover the problem of Panhellenism, the conflict between Rome and 4 Bradley's Arnold Latin Prose Composition. Revised Edition.

The next swathe of foreign publications covers different genres of literature. Ars/Techne brings together a number of essays on a range of technical literature. Many naturally concern the art of rhetoric, on which many both well-known and more obscure treatises are extant. But other angles are also represented, such as Ptolemy of Cyrene's work on music in a piece by Eleonora Rocconi. Yet another Italian contribution is Carbone's serious and scholarly volume on a light-hearted topic, Tabliope, on the subject of games and literature in the Graeco-Roman world.8 Also in ludic vein is a Portuguese publication, Sdtira, par6dia e caricatura,9 a wide-ranging collection of essays stretching from Homer, through Simonides and Plato, to more modern authors. Different forms of continuity have underpinned the work of Geoffrey Lloyd over the last few years (see reviews of Ancient Worlds, Modern Reflections in G&amp;R 52.1 [2005] and of The Way and the Word in G&amp;R 50.2 [2003]). The latter of these two explored connec- tions between western Classical and ancient Chinese medicine, and it is this spatial span between western and eastern traditions, added to a temporal continuity from antiquity to the present day, which form the matrices for his latest production, The Delusions of Invulnerability.10 Here Lloyd brings his breadth of knowledge and capacious thinking to the problem of wisdom and how it was generated, regulated, and received in two very different cultures, with a view to illuminating underlying questions and issues which may still be of relevance to us today. Continuity between the Classical past and the present via the so-called 'western tradition' underpins the exploration of yet another theme treated by a range of authors in Same-Sex Desire and Love.11 At least, the presence of such a volume takes a certain degree of continuity for granted to provide its conceptual unity. The preface sets out the editors' aspiration to demonstrate how much the study of same-sex desire and love has advanced in the quarter of a century since Dover's Greek Homosexuality, in terms of both theoretical debates and the understanding of socio-historical contexts. On an ever potentially controversial subject, the volume was modified before publi- cation in the light of adverse media interest in one of its intended contributions, and the association, perhaps even hijacking, of the book by particular interest groups strikes one as unfortunate, since it may cloud the differences in context and perception of homosexuality between Classical antiquity and the present day. As always, observation of continuity must always carry with it the attendant alertness to the possibility of change and difference a la Lloyd. That the ancient world was indeed interested in sex and love, including both homosexual and heterosexual liaisons, as a theme for literature, art, and philosophical debate is, of course, not in doubt. Anyone who needs reassurance on this matter should pick up Bertman's new 8 Tabliope. Richerche su Gioco e Letteratura nel Mondo Greco-Romano. By Gabrielle Carbone.

It would make a handy starting point for anyone inter- ested in exploring the earlier phases of one of the most enduring genres in world literature, love poetry, but the reader would need to move swiftly through and beyond this book to find further more detailed commentary. Another generically-driven book is a neat volume from Crete and the Rethymnon Classical Studies series on Roman and Greek Imperial Epic.13 The quality of the volume is almost guaranteed by the list of contributors - including not only Paschalis himself, but also O'Gorman, Barchiesi, Hardie, and Hunter, to name but few of a distinguished cast. The focus on imperial epic is timely, given recent interest in Flaccus and Statius, and more generally in the resurrection and transformation of well-known literary forms from the Greek tradition in the new circumstances of the settled, peaceful, flourishing Roman empire. Each individual contribution is worthwhile, but the volume overall adds up to a really substantial illumination of imperial epic. Speaking of epics, Robin Lane Fox claims to have written one to cover the grand sweep of antiquity in The Classical World. An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian.14 From most authors this would be a vain boast, but Lane Fox, with his wealth of learning and unbridled passion for the subject, is a worthy claimant to the task. He implicitly reasserts the power and value of narrative history by adopting a magisterial chronological sweep from Homer onwards, but, as Lane Fox has often claimed, narrative is a medium which is no less susceptible to nuance, uncertainty, and interpretation than other, more obviously analytical forms of history. This is neatly illustrated by the subtle underpinning of the 'story' by major themes such as justice and freedom, by the careful balance between vastness of scope (both geographical and chronological), an eye for deep structures, and a sense of intricate differentiation, and above all by the choice to tell this particular history of the Classical world through the eyes of one its greatest admirers, the emperor Hadrian. This perspective is not explicit, of course, but rather embedded in the book's appreciation for where all those centuries of history had led to by the second century AD. The whole is infused with an enthu- siasm which should win over even the most entrenched proponent of the view that 'the Classical world is no longer relevant.' For Lane Fox both the Classical world and the art of story-telling on a grand scale are very much alive. One of the most important but elusive aspects of Archaic and Classical Greek history is the emergence of that most difficult to define entity, the polis. Lane Fox devotes some time to discussion of the possibilities (pp. 24-8), and, while his questions about whether the polis refers to a 'community' or a 'settlement' or a 'citizen-state' or a 'community of warriors' would remain worth asking in conceptual terms, some assistance in pinning down the essence of the polis might be offered by the appearance of An Inventory of 12 Erotic Love Poems of Greece and Rome.

The latter always takes time and effort and the results almost always reflect that. Before launching into a survey, area by area, of every polis known from our evidence, the volume sets out its stall. There is a small section of explanation as to how most profitably to use the book, setting out its methods and conventions for the reader, followed by a whole series of sections (150 pages in total) in which parameters are set (chronologically, in terms of definition and terminology, and so on), and different aspects of the polis are discussed, as well as the different types of available evidence being assessed. Over a thousand pages of inventory are followed by another 150 of appendices. With bibliog- raphy at the end of each regional section and meticulous care taken over the entries on each polis, this is a masterpiece of scholarship - clearly not a book to read cover to cover, but a magnificent and essential resource for anyone studying the Greek world. One of the most striking, though not unique, features of the best-known polis of all, Athens, was of course its foray into varying forms of democracy at a certain point in its history. The democracy that flourished in some of the Greek poleis and its resurgence and later dominance in European thought and practice is the subject of a new book by Canfora, Democracy in Europe.16 By contrast with some volumes which trace the history of a concept or a form across millennia, this one actually does so with understanding, assurance, and style. Canfora's trick is to focus attention on key stages in the evolution of democracy as an intellectual and political form, without insisting on clinging to the Greek version as paradigmatic. Indeed the great majority of the work is devoted to the post-Classical history of European democracy, as the title leads us to expect. Nevertheless, for the Classicist, to see the later history of such a key feature of the ancient political landscape (some would argue for Republican Rome as well as for Greece) always has the potential to enhance illumination of the ancient world. While we are on the subject of continuities between the Greek polis and the modern world, we should note the arrival of another excellent volume from the Institute of Classical Studies in London. Ancient Athens and Modern Ideology17 started its life as a doctoral thesis and has been successfully transformed into an interesting book. Its highly theoretical approach is dependent on modern thinkers for its underpinning rather than on ancient evidence, and it is these modern thinkers - Weber, Polanyi, and Finley - who articulate the structure of the book. It represents a bold foray into a hotly fought-over piece of intellectual territory. From Athens and the history of democracy we move to the rather different world of the Hellenistic kingdoms. It is a great pleasure to note the 15 An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis. Edited by Mogens Herman Hansen and Thomas Heine Nielsen. Oxford UP, 2004. Pp. xv + 1396.

As reviews of the hardback original observed, the volume was, and is, rare in combining such a broad scope with such detailed and scholarly insights, such comprehensive treatment with a sense of new discoveries and approaches. Companions and 'survey books' are regularly subject to the criticism that they fail to add anything to what we already knew, and simply regurgitate the fodder over and over again for more generations of as-yet unfledged young. The same could not be said of Erskine's volume which lines up an array of serious scholars and allows them to play to their strengths and interests, leaving Erskine's editorial eye to watch over overall coverage and the unity of the undertaking. The result is an important contri- bution to the field of Hellenistic scholarship, useful to both the expert and the less-experienced reader. The transformation into paperback is to be warmly welcomed for bringing this book within the financial reach of a broad readership, not least that of undergraduates. If democracy and kingship could be seen to characterize two phases of Lane Fox's sweeping history, war was a phenomenon which spanned the whole period. Soldiers and Ghosts19 takes war in the ancient world as its theme. Like Lane Fox, Lendon starts with Homer, but his chronological sweep stretches beyond even Hadrian to the late fourth century. Although the subtitle encourages us to think that Lendon is focusing on one, albeit important, aspect of warfare, namely direct engagement or battle, in fact the scope of his book is much broader than that and covers, for example, strategy, war experience, and the impact of technological advances. Lively and engaged, it should be of considerable interest both to the ancient historian and to anyone interested in the conduct of, and ideology underpinning, armed conflict in any period. Warfare has attracted scholarly attention also in a multi-author volume, The Ethics of War, edited by Sorabji and Rodin.20 This brings together contributions by academics, philosophers, ethicists, and public policy figures on the subject, looking both back at past conflicts and forwards to emerging issues. The book has clearly been stimulated by very recent events such as 9/11 and the attacks by the West on Afghanistan and Iraq, but the ethical questions raised by such conflicts concerning justification, aims, parameters, civilians, and so on, are not so very different from those which our study of the ancient world evinces. Although the book does not address the ancient world in any concerted way, the notion of the iustum bellum or the 'just war' remains as pertinent now as it was in the period of Roman imperialism when the civilizing mission was enough to 'justify' almost any exercise of force over another people. This seems to be a prime instance when past and present may offer mutual illumination. If too much talk of warfare is dispiriting, then it is worth remembering that the Classical world was not all about doom and gloom. Finally we have two books which between them represent the more positive mainstay of ancient Rome, bread and circuses. Food in the Ancient World21 is a delightful book and takes the reader way beyond mere 18 A Companion to the Hellenistic World. Edited by Andrew Erskine. Blackwell, Oxford, 2005.

The collaboration between John Wilkins, who has made ancient food into an academic specialism, and Shaun Hill, chef and former owner of the Michelin-starred Merchant House, has clearly been a fruitful and life-enhancing one. The subject matter is appealing, the style both learned and light, the range of the treatment imagi- native and varied. The authors declare themselves to be interested in both the food and the contexts in which it was eaten - thus we see food here as a means to survival and as a social phenomenon. Different angles are explored including medical approaches to food and food in literature, and the book ends with a series of ancient recipes, together with comments or tips on how to turn them into edible reality. Although there is a declared intention to 'review the diet of the millions of ancient Greeks and Romans who did not belong to the pampered Roman elite of the pages of Suetonius' (ix), in other words to focus to some degree on the 'bread' of the Roman mob, this book whets the reader's appetite for the full menu gastronomique. And finally, we draw our editorial stint to a close with something spectacular. Spectacular Power in the Greek and Roman City22 goes way beyond circuses, just as our last book extended the palate beyond bread. But the phenomenon whereby huge crowds gathered to watch spectacles of various kinds and thereby interacted both amongst themselves and with the object of their gaze, as well as being incorporated into a matrix of power relations, self-defining displays, and political self-assertion, was almost as central to life as bread itself. Each chapter is self-contained, but the whole does add up to a still more powerful evocation of spectacle and display on a grand scale - the recurring theme of elephants merely underscores this point. This book has the merit of analysing ancient societies and their dynamics from the outside, but also perhaps more significantly, drawing the reader in to a point from which he or she can imaginatively share the wonder of the ancient viewer, reminding us yet again that, in spite of spatial and temporal distance, direct engagement with the artefacts, words, and ideas of the Classical world is still what makes the subject thrive. doi: 10.1017/S0017383506000374 CHRISTOPHER BURNAND AND KATHERINE CLARKE 22 Spectacular Power in the Greek and Roman City.
