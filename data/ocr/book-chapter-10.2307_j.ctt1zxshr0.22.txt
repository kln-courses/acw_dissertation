Ivanov’s Poem “nudus salta!” and The Purpose of art 307 Ivanov’s untitled poem “Nudus salta! Tsel’ iskusstva” (“Dance  naked! The Purpose of Art”) appears in his Roman Notebook (Rimskii  dnevnik, 1944) and is dated February 18, 1944.2 Three earlier versions of  the poem date from February 15 through February 17, 1944.3 In those  few days, the poem underwent some small, but significant, changes. “Nudus salta!” consists of four stanzas of five lines each. On  the semantic plane, the poem may be divided into two parts, each  consisting of two stanzas (referred to in this discussion as parts one  and two). The first two stanzas of the poem appear in quotation marks.  At the opening of poem, an unnamed speaker, the poet’s antagonist,  issues a command, “Nudus salta!” (Dance naked!), declaring in sum  that the “purpose of art” is to disclose without inhibition the carnal  underground of human nature.4 Art in this perspective engages in  a kind of erotic danse macabre.  In part two of “Nudus salta!” that is, the third and fourth stanzas  of the poem, the poet himself steps forth, and without engaging in  any direct polemic with his unnamed antagonist on the question of  2 See Ivanov’s collection of poems entitled Rimskii dnevnik (1944) in Vyacheslav  Ivanov, Sobranie sochinenii, 4 vols. (Bruxelles: Foyer Oriental Chrétien, 1979),  3:594–595.  3 The original variants may be found in the archives of Vyacheslav I. Ivanov  in Rome.  4 Ivanov’s allusions in the first two stanzas of “Nudus salta!” are  unmistakably to the ancient Greek “Mysteries of Dionysus,” a religious cult  of suffering and sacrificial death; this cult was characterized by orgiastic  passion rites in which music and dance and drink liberated worshippers  from inhibitions and restraints, social and sexual, and plunged them into  a state of Dionysian “rapture” and “madness.” Ivanov discussed, and in  a certain sense, celebrated the Dionysian cult in his series of lectures The  Hellenic Religion of the Suffering God: An Essay in a Religious and Historical  Description (Ellinskaia religiia stradaiushchego boga: Opyt religiozno-istoricheskoi  kharakteristiki”) published in Novyi put’ in 1904, and later in his unpublished  manuscript of the same title and work in 1917. Ivanov embraced the Roman  Catholic faith in Rome in 1926, and in the 1920s and 1930s underwent a  religious-spiritual renewal. In his poem “Nudus salta!” composed during  World War II, Ivanov casts a critical eye at the darker side of the Dionysian  cult, even as he remains captivated by transcendental elements of the  Dionysian cult. Citations in this essay to Ivanov’s important study Hellenic  Religion of the Suffering God refer to a translation (in process) of this work by  Dr. Carol Anschuetz. The Russian original manuscript is in the archives of  Vyacheslav Ivanov in Rome.  </page> <page sequence="4"> 308 Critical Perspectives the purpose of art, announces his devout commitment to the Muses  and to both a classical and pastoral world where art and the artist are  characterized by their sacrificial and devotional functions. In the final  line of the poem, the poet returns to the theme of the underground  and suggests that the artist can play a role by tempering underground  passions.  Part one of the poem posits a Dionysian netherworld of “dark . . .  sensations” (temnye . . . chuvstva), a chthonic realm of passions out of  sight and off limits. The unknown speaker calls for a kind of artistic  bacchanalia in which one would dance “uncovered” (bez pokrovov)  and “unfettered” (bez okov) and would “show what you are” (pokazat’,  kto ty takov). He alludes darkly to a “hidden sanctuary” (zapovednyi  tainik),5 roiling “potholes” (omuty)6 under the ice (pod l’dom),7 and  finally, to a “dead house” (mertvyi dom), where lies hidden from light  of day “unconscious Sodom” (podsoznatel’nyi Sodom)—a reference that  would seem to encompass both the notion of a repressed subconscious  world of unbridled sexual impulse and desire and the idea of almost  anthropomorphic Sodom. Ivanov’s end rhymes in the second stanza  (l’dom, mertvyi dom, Sodom), foregrounding the sound and word “dom”  (house) lead the reader to the nethermost house of debauchery: Sodom.  In an early draft of “Nudus salta!” the “dead house” is in fact  a place where “where an unconscious Sodom is hiding from  punishment” (gde ot Bozh’ikh kar taitsia / podsoznatel’nyi Sodom). In  a second version of the poem, “a spellbound Sodom” (zakoldovannyi  Sodom) is hiding from God’s punishment. In the final version of the  5 For a discussion of Ivanov’s concept of “Zapovednyi tainik,” see footnote 12  of this essay.  6 “Omut”—pothole, whirlpool, deep hollows at the bottom of a river where  currents swirl. A well-known Russian proverb runs “V tikhom omute cherti  vodiatsia,” literally, “in a quiet hollow under the water devils are at play”;  figuratively, “a quiet, reserved person is capable of doing things that one  would never expect of them.” 7 “Pod l’dom” (under the ice): the phrase “l’dom” may be an indirect reference  to the once popular historical novel, The Ice Palace (Ledianoi dom, 1835) by  Ivan I. Lazhechnikov (1792–1869). The “ice house” or “ice palace” actually  existed. In Lazhechnikov’s novel, it is is a symbol of the despotic reign of  Empress Anna Ioannovna; it casts a shadow on all aspects of the novel’s  intrigue and passions. The veiled allusion to the “ice palace,” then, is  a fitting image for Ivanov’s dark and ominous underworld. </page> <page sequence="5"> Vyacheslav I. Ivanov’s Poem “nudus salta!” and The Purpose of art 309 poem, Ivanov replaces the words “from God’s punishment” (ot Bozh’ikh  kar) with “from the light of day” (ot bela dnia), thus veiling the notion  that “Sodom” is perhaps the devil, the great antagonist of God, and  that our violent sexual unconscious or subconscious has been confined  here in some kind of spellbound state. These suppositions are echoed  in somewhat different imagery in Ivanov’s early study, The Hellenic  Religion of the Suffering God (Ellinskaia religiia stradaiushchego boga,  1904; 1917), where he writes that “the principle of cosmos and order  in everything, having effected a profound transformation of our  inner primeval chaos yet not transformed it altogether, has outwardly  subdued it and confined it to the sphere of the subconscious, whence it  breaks out volcanically in destructive eruptions.”8  Our violent carnal instincts, Ivanov suggests in “Nudus salta!”  have been committed to a deep dungeon or “dead house.” Art’s  purpose, according to the unnamed speaker, is explore and celebrate  its interior. On the esthetic plane, his command to “unseal the dead  house” (raspechatat’ mertvyi dom) is a call to depict the human nature  in a wholly naturalistic way, that is, to show people what they are. The  corollary of this naturalism on the plane of human behavior is that  everything is permissible. Naturalism for Ivanov, as for Dostoevsky,  posits a thoroughly despiritualized view of the world; it is evidence of  moral-esthetic bankrupcy.  The image and concept of a “dead house” in Ivanov’s poem,  of course, signals Dostoevsky’s strong moral and literary presence.  The call to unseal the “dead house” and to awaken the unconscious  Sodom brings to mind Dostoevsky’s Notes from the House of the Dead  (Zapiski iz mertvogo doma, 1861–1862), where a world of violence and  moral degradation is disclosed in a variety of ways. Yet in a more  direct way, the poem echoes the lubricious and lugubrious world of  “contemporary corpses” in Dostoevsky’s fantasy-grotesque, “Bobok.  The Notes of a Certain Person”—a sketch first published in his Diary of  a Writer in 1873. It is a tale that satirizes the materialism and so-called  realism or naturalism of contemporary art and society.9  The still-living, but decaying and dying “contemporary corpses”  that the narrator of “Bobok” overhears in his visit to the cemetery  8 See “Hellenic Religion,” 226. 9 See my discussion of “Bobok” in The Art of Dostoevsky: Deliriums and  Nocturnes (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1981), 288–303. </page> <page sequence="6"> 310 Critical Perspectives and tomb stones find their most typical representative in the Sadean  figure of the engineer Baron Klinevich. He invites his expiring fellow  corpses in the time remaining to them unashamedly to engage in  a kind of literary and everyday debauch of sensuality. Like the Marquis  de Sade, Klinevich has a keen sense of the role of narrative art in the  breakdown of moral-spiritual culture. He proposes first of all that  “nobody be ashamed of anything” (“Oh, yes, yes, let’s not be ashamed  of anything!” respond the voices of many corpses). He follows with  a proposal for a symposium, a kind of Decameron of the dead, in  which nobody will lie: We’ll all tell our stories out loud to the others and not be ashamed  of anything. I’ll tell you about myself first of all. I am, you see,  an animal sensualist. Up above everything was bound by rotten  ropes. Down with ropes, and let’s live out these last two months  in the most shameless truth! Let’s become naked and bare  outselves! “Let’s bare ourselves,” cried all the voices. “I terribly,  terribly want to be naked,” squealed Avdotya Ignatievna . . .  “The main thing is that nobody can stop us.” Shamelessly telling all is the literary corollary of nakedness,  a symptom for Dostoevsky of social and cultural disintegration. (If  everybody spoke their mind, he once remarked, the world would  drown in a sea of muck). The narrator of “Bobok” himself, Ivan Ivanych  early in his narrative complains that he has lost control of his language,  his “style” is changing, it has become “hackneyed.” Of the painter who  meticulously depicts the warts on his, Ivan Ivanych’s face, he remarks,  “They have no ideas, so they go to town on phenomena. But what  a job he did on my warts in the portrait—they’re alive! They call this  realism!” “Bobok” ends in a whirling danse macabre of “contemporary  corpses.”  It is noteworthy that Ivanov foregrounded the motif of  shamelessness in an early draft of the poem: “Nudus salta! The purpose of art, Freeing oneself from all chains,  Not being ashamed of what you are . . .” [Nudus salta! Tsel’ iskusstva,  Svobodias’ ot vsekh okov, Ne stydias’, chto ty takov.]  </page> <page sequence="7"> Vyacheslav I. Ivanov’s Poem “nudus salta!” and The Purpose of art 311 Ivanov dropped the words “not being ashamed” in the final  version of his poem, yet shamelessness remains implicit in the  celebration of being uncovered, or without cover (bez pokrovov).  The word “pokrov” means “cover,” but it also suggests “Pokrov’,”  “protection,” “veil,” as in the Orthodox Feast of the Intercession,  known as “Pokrov’” or “Protective Veil of the Holy Virgin.” Thus, an  esthetic or art that takes away all “cover” is also intrinsically without  spiritual or religious patronage. In the second part of Ivanov’s poem, the action shifts from  the profane world of Sodom to the sacred world of the Muses, from  a world of darkness to the light of day. This division between night  and day echoes formally and semantically the Russian poet Fyodor  Tyutchev’s poem, “Day and Night” (“Den’ i noch’,” 1839), a poem of  great importance to Ivanov. The “glittering, smooth ice” that covers the  abyss in “Nudus salta!” recalls Tyutchev’s “Day—that brilliant cover”  (“Den’—sei blistatel’nyi pokrov”) which hides the “nameless abyss”  (bezymiannaia bezdna). Tyutchev’s “day” animates the “earth-born” and  heals the “suffering soul.” Night, however, tears away the “beneficent  fabric of cover” (tkan’ blagodatnuiu pokrova) and bares the abyss with its  “terrors and fogs.”  The theme of “baring” (obnazhenie) is common to both Tyutchev’s  and Ivanov’s poems. What night does in Tyutchev’s poem is what the  unnamed speaker calls upon art to do: tear away the “pokrov” (cover),  the sacred veil, and bare the abyss. What is ominous and terrible about  the abyss of night in the poem “Day and Night,” as Tyutchev puts it,  is that “there are no barriers between us and it” (net pregrad mezh nei i  nami).  Ivanov in “Nudus salta!” distances himself from his abyss. His  quotation marks serve to fence in or quarantine the unnamed speaker’s  literary manifesto. Part one ends with the concept of an unconscious  Sodom. In the last analysis, Sodom is not an external, visible, enemy,  a monster of the day, but an internal, intangible, nocturnal one who  inhabits the dungeon of human spirit and who attacks by stealth.  The explicit motif of “turning away” from the abyss is apparent  not only in the final line of the poem, but in the opening line of part two  where the poet decisively separates himself from the profane world  of Sodom and declares his personal allegiance to a different world  where art and spirituality are united. “Sacred to me is the enclosure  of the Muses” (Mne sviashchenna Muz ograda); the poet's habitation is  the “enclosure of the Muses.” The poet chooses the protection and  </page> <page sequence="8"> 312 Critical Perspectives patronage of the classical Muses, those who preside over poetry and  the arts, divinities of the open spirit as opposed to the demons of  confinement.  The “enclosure” (ograda) of the Muses, as Ivanov wrote in Hellenic  Religion, are the grounds where “great art” was born.10 Ivanov writes  about a specific part of the ancient Greek Acropolis: This enclosure (ograda) which housed a theater and two temples  of different antiquity . . . was the most important arena of  Dionysiac art. Here the tragic muse first revealed herself to the  human spirit in beauty’s unfading forms. [Eta ograda, vmeshchavshaia teatr i dva khrama razlichnoi  drevnosti, byla vazhneisheiu v Gretsii arenoi dionisiiskogo  iskusstva. Zdes’ tragicheskaia muza vpervye otkrylas’  chelovecheskomu dukhu v neuviadaiushchikh formakh  krasoty.]11 Dionysiac worship or ritual resulting in the art form of tragedy  is, in Ivanov’s presentation, a conflation of both Apollonian and  Dionysiac elements, of both suffering and harmony. “A fine line divided  the redemptive from the destructive effects of the terrible Dionysiac  element,” Ivanov wrote in Hellenic Religion. “They found rapture on  the edge of the abyss, in the whirlwind of orgies, in the breath of  a frenzied god.”12 A very firm line separates the “redemptive” from the  “terrible Dionysiac element” in “Nudus salta!” Few hints of this vision  of paradoxical and paroxysmal Dionysiac religious ethos are to be  found in Ivanov’s “Nudus salta!”13 Certainly, the implied esthetic of the  10 “Hellenic Religion,” 47. 11 Ibid., 43. 12 Ibid., 82.  13 One detects in “Nudus salta!” a hint of the “breath of a frenzied god.”  Ivanov’s mysterious underground “zapovednyi tainik” (translated here as  “hidden sanctuary”) seems to allude to Dionysiac “rapture at the edge of the  abyss.” “Zapovednyi tainik” does not lend itself to easy translation. “Tainik”  has the meaning of “hiding place,” “cache,” of “recess.” The adjective  “Zapovednyi” is often used in the sense of reserve, e.g. “zapovednyi  les”—“forest reserve,” “preserve” or “sanctuary”—a place where one  may be forbidden to go, or one that is reserved or preserved for other than  everyday use. “Zapovednyi” carries with it the idea of prohibition, but also  </page> <page sequence="9"> Vyacheslav I. Ivanov’s Poem “nudus salta!” and The Purpose of art 313 poet-persona of “Nudus salta!” leaves no room for creative interaction  between “day” and “night” in the esthetic process of the contemporary  writer or artist.  In an early essay, “Testaments of Symbolism” (“Zavety  simvolizma,” 1910), however, Ivanov posits a certain “dualism” in the  artist’s consciousness and creative work, in his spiritual self, precisely  a kind of “symbolic dualism of day and night.” “Do these worlds exist  in a state of enmity?” he asks. “In poetry,” he answers, “they are both  together. We now call them Apollon and Dionysus, we know their  inseparable and undivided nature.”  In that same essay, Ivanov writes that the artist “limits his thirst  to merge with the ‘limitless,’ his striving for ‘oblivion,’ ‘annihilation.’”  He turns rather to the “clear forms of daytime existence, to the patterns  of the ‘gold-cloth veil’ (zlatotkannogo pokrova) thrown by the gods onto  the mysterious world of the spirit, onto the ‘nameless abyss,’ that  is, the abyss that does not find its name in the language of daytime  consciousness and eternal experience.” “All the same,” he writes,  “the most valuable moment in experience and the most prophetic in  creation is submergence in that contemplative ecstasy where there are  ‘no barriers’ (net pregrady) between us and the ‘naked abyss’ opening  up—in Silence.”14 It is a sober and somber Ivanov that composes in 1944 the  very cautionary “Nudus salta!” In his poem, as we have seen, there  are strong barriers between the poet and this naked abyss; above all,  there is no “submergence” in contemplative ecstasy: the Apollonian  and Dionysian form stark antitheses. The silent abyss is manifestly  a “dead house.” The “dead house” and the “enclosure of the Muses”  the notion of the “sacral” or the “holy” (see, for example, “zapoved’”— precept, commandment, as in the Ten Commandments). The notion of  a “zapovednyi tainik,” then, presents a disturbing ambiguity of meaning.  In the context of the stanza, the phrase suggests something sinister: a secret  hiding place or dwelling where reprehensible things take place. In the  Dionysiac context, however, this same hiding place may be a holy place,  recess or grounds where primitive rites, rituals or sacrifices, may take  place. “Zapovednyi tainik,” in this interpretation, takes on the character of  a secret, yet sacred place of corruption, where the borders between holiness  and pollution are still undefined.  14 See “Zavety simvolizma” in Vyacheslav Ivanov, Sobranie sochinenii,  4 vols.  (Bruxelles: Foyer Oriental Chrétien, 1979), 2:590–591. </page> <page sequence="10"> 314 Critical Perspectives (ograda) stand in stark contrast each another, despite the identification  of the “ograda” with Ivanov’s beloved sacred grounds of Dionysus.  “Dionysus is more mighty in the soul of Tyutchev than Apollo,”  Ivanov had written in “Testaments of Symbolism,”15 In “Nudus salta!”  one may say that Apollo is more mighty in the soul of Ivanov than  Dionysus, although the poetic power of “Nudus salta!” nonetheless  rests on what Ivanov had called the “symbolic dualism of day and  night” in the artist's creative consciousness. Here poetry, as Ivanov had  anticipated in “Testaments of Symbolism,” remains at variance with  ideology in the broad sense of the term. The magic of the ancient classical world, its language and  imagery, however, continues to exert its power over the Ivanov. Pushkin  in his poem “Poet” (1827) speaks of Apollo as one who calls upon the  poet to participate in “sacred sacrifice” (sviashchennaia zhertva). In “The  Poet and the Crowd” (Poet i tolpa, 1828), he refers to the poet’s art as  “service, altar, sacrifice” (sluzhen’e, altar’, zhertvoprinoshenie). The fires  of Ivanov’s “pure altars” (chistykh altarei) in “Nudus salta!” appear  ready for ritual cleansing and purification. Yet these sacred fires stand  ready for another affirmative symbolic offering: Zharu chistykh altarei Dar moi—agnets luchshii stada I plody, perviny sada, Ne gnezdo netopyrei. [To the fires of purifying altars (Go) my gift—the best lamb of the herd, And the first fruits of the garden, Not a nest of bats.] The poet’s “dar,” his “gift,” the lamb, and the fruits of the garden,  contrast strikingly with the “nest of bats,” creatures of the night who  dwell beneath the sacred grounds of the Muses.16 The poet’s “gift”  (dar), of course, is also his talent (dar), the art he dedicates to the Muses. 15 Ibid., 591. 16 The negative connotations of this image are manifested in the thrice- repeated syllable “ne, ne, ne” (in Russian “not” or “no”) in the phrase: “Ne,  gnezdo netopyrei.” In literature, myth and folk saying, bats are typically  associated with darkness and the damned. Dante’s Lucifer is buried in  </page> <page sequence="11"> Vyacheslav I. Ivanov’s Poem “nudus salta!” and The Purpose of art 315 The transcendental habitation of the Muses is symbolized not  by the roiling waters of the potholes under the ice, but by a spring  that comes out of the bedrock of a mountain. The mountain spring  alludes to the Castalian Spring, sacred to the Muses and Apollo, on  the slopes of Parnassus in Greece. The mountain there has two peaks,  both frequented by the Muses: one sacred to Dionysus, and the other  to Apollo, the god of Greek prophecy and healing.  The final stanza of Ivanov’s poem opens in the mountains of the  muses. The poem then descends to the “deserts of nature” with their  spices and wild grass, a point midway between the depths of Sodom  and the heights of the Muses. The images of garden, fruits, waters,  spices, and wild grass seem to carry intimations of the Biblical Song  of Solomon or Song of Songs (Song of Songs 4:14–16) where pastoral  paradise cradle a lyric eroticism—one far removed from the frenzied  Dionysian eroticism of part one of “Nudus salta!” The poem that begins with the abrupt command, “Nudus salta!”  ends with a gentle imperative:  Pour purifying waters,  After turning away, into the underground darkness.  [Lei chistitel’nye vody, Otvratias’, v podzemnyi mrak] Here is the poet’s most direct response to the unknown narrator’s  esthetic manifesto in part one. It sums up his view of art, an old one,  as one involving ritual cleansing and purification. The emphasis on  “turning away” suggests not only moral revulsion and perhaps  a turning away from temptation, but the poet’s own need for spiritual  purification.  In this sense, Ivanov’s miniscule poem presents itself as a testi- monial, an initiation, and an act of redemption. The poem, a didactic  one, projects itself—to borrow words from Ivanov’s Hellenic Religion  ice. His wings, in Dante’s description, were “mighty ones.” “They had no  feathers, but were like a bat’s” (Non avean penne, ma di vispisrello era lor modo).  See Charles S. Singleton, Dante, Inferno. Bollngen Series 80 (Princeton, NJ:  Princeton University Press, 1970) Canto 35: 49–50.  </page> <page sequence="12"> 316 Critical Perspectives forty years earlier—as a kind of “spiritual re-education which the con- temporary psyche undoubtedly needs.”17  In Ivanov’s poem, “Palinodiia” (1927), the poet envisages  himself as one who had served as an acolyte or assistant (sluzhitel’)  in the temple of Dionysus. In the final lines of poem he describes  a moment of temptation when, drawn to the old “rebellious longing/  Of indomitable night,” he heard a “call from heaven: ‘Abandon, priest,  the temple decorated by demons.’ And I fled,”/ the poet recalls, “and  I eat [now] in the foothills of Thebaid/ the wild honey and coarse  locusts of silence.”  In “Nudus salta!” Ivanov completes a movement from Hellenic  Religion through “The Testaments of Symbolism” and “Palinodia.” Old  passions, old idols, have been cast out, old syntheses outgrown. Not  the tormented, divided, Dionysian, Bacchic underworld, but a softened  Dionysian and Apollonian realm of “service, altar, and sacrifice” is  celebrated. What emerges in the poem, too, are gestures of solidarity  with Dostoevsky’s morally and spiritually-infused realism and  Pushkin’s abandonment of classical idols for “stern,” but transcendent  “beauty” (“At the Beginning of Life I remember School” [“V nachale  zhizni shkolu pomniu ia”, 1830]). Finally, there are hints in “Nudus  saltas!” of a new synthesis of a purified classicism and Christianity. Of  Christianity, nothing is directly said in the poem, but what is indicated  is unmistakeable: “My gift is the best lamb of the herd.” 17 “Hellenic Religion,” 224–225. </page> </plain_text>
