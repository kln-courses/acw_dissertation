Solipsism, the writer defines as " the doctrine that all existence is experi- ence and that there is only one experient. The advocate of solipsism thinks he is that one." Traces of this theory have appeared in Absolute Idealism, in Subjective Idealism, in most of the historically great systems and even in New Realism. The New Realist is so engrossed in his object that he is not on guard against his own subjectivity. His Psychology is bad. He does not take into account the facts of true and false percep- tions, of the comparison of perceptions, of the selectiveness of attention, of the deceit of the world. He is too naive, too trustful. To apply these generalizations the writer considers three forms of New Realism. i. The unsophisticated belief that the mind perceives reality directly and not copies of objects is tenable only on the solipsistic ground that the experient is the only mind. 2. The second type provides for error by distinguishing be- tween knowledge and opinion. With this distinction as a basis, we must either accept agnosticism toward all real problems or else hold that my opinion constitutes the only real knowledge. 3. The third type, too, must adopt the fundamental position of solipsism in order to escape the vast mass of physical objects which it necessitates. Finally the doctrine of the organic relation of subject and object is either solipsism or nonsense, since the world of objects, on that view, could exist only so long as the experient endures as a subject. Thus it might seem that all systems are forced as a final resort to take refuge in solipsism. The Humanist, however, is undaunted. He bases his refutation of Solipsism on the postulate of other minds, a postulate proven by its results. If solipsism is only a theory without application to practice there can perhaps be no argument against it save the difficulty it would have in accounting for multiple personality; 96</page><page sequence="2">SLXMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 97 if, however, it is to be practical it must recognize other minds and there- fore be no different from other philosophies. H. E. WEAVER. Le volontarisme. PAUL SOLLIER. Rev. Ph., XXXIV, 7, pp. i-i6. The conception of the will is greatly confused, not only in metaphysical theories, but in the very definition of the word and as regards the phe- nomena to which it is applied. It is, in fact, very difficult to distinguish a voluntary from an involuntary act. Some would apply voluntarism to every function, even to automatism. Yet no 'will to live' is needed to account for the maintenance and development of life. The greater part of this struggle is in the sub-conscious realm. If we say that con- sciousness perceives itself as will, confusion arises; on the other hand a ' blind will' is no better off than a 'bound will.' It may seem easy to pass by analogy from the outer to the inner life and declare that charac- ter also depends on the will, but any distinction between voluntary and involuntary attention likewise breaks down. We may govern the expres- sion of our passions but not the passions themselves. Serious evil results from the voluntaristic conception as applied in Christian Science but still more serious under the title of ' the will to believe.' Pragmatism encour- ages a belief in the relativity of truth. When truth is subordinated to in- dividual belief it becomes vague and uncertain. Some vainly try to sepa- rate the question of will from that of free choice in behalf of morality. Since, however, morality is a fact, existing before all theories, it cannot possibly destroy morality even if the theory of free will is found to rest on an illusion. But as a matter of fact, moral considerations are not foremost for the voluntarists. Behind those are metaphysical and religious pre-con- ceptions. If I can create truth by my will, I can create God. Thus scien- tific truth is brought into suspicion and religious truth is affirmed. The concept of ' will' should be subjected to a rigorous critique and the results with all their consequences opposed to the sophisms and ingenious para- doxes of the voluntarists. HARVEY G. TOWNSEND. Professor Laurie's Natural Realism, II. J. B. BAILLIE. Mind, No. 70, pp. 184-207. The second volume of the Synthetica considers two interrelated problems, the nature and meaning of ultimate reality and the individual's place in that reality. Before treating these problems the writer discusses two questions pertaining to Professor Laurie's method, (a) What form of knowledge is to be adopted for this Absolute Synthesis ? and (b) To what extent does the sub- ject-object relation hold in that synthesis ? (a) Professor Laurie states that rational intuition, which, however, is not found in finite experience, is the condition of absolute synthesis. This intuition is the gathering up of the knowledge of parts as parts into a focus of the whole as a whole and is</page><page sequence="3">98 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. therefore the highest form of knowledge. (b) In this absolute synthesis the subject-object relation still holds good. The Absolute, although including the subject And object, is object for man in as much as the various stages of knowledge do possess objective content, and to express that content truly is to reveal the Absolute on that plane. Such a method, since it takes the finite as a basis for the infinite, must necessarily approach anthropomor- phism, but not anthropomorphism in the old sense. The Absolute for Professor Laurie is not a new object for thought but is that which has been with us all along as the basis of all experience. Therefore our knowledge of God is anthropomorphic only in the sense that all knowledge is. God, however, is not merely the objective experience of man. As the totality of man's experience, he is immanent; as the continuity with all being felt by man, he is transcendent. In the former sense alone can He be known. The independence of finite individuals, to take up the second problem, is just as ultimate as the existence of the infinite unconditioned. These indi- viduals consist of the union-of affirmation and negation, the former making them co-workers with God, the latter making them 'resist' God. In Professor Laurie's treatment of evil and of immortality we have perhaps an over-emphasis upon this negative element of the individual. Negation would lead to strife and chaos were it not for affirmation, for the controlling agency of the End, for the Absolute itself. This striving of the individual is at the same time the striving of God in him. The Absolute, as the source of negation, is the source of evil but not its direct creator. It is the failure of the Absolute, at least on this plane. The last stage of negation, however, viz., death, is the possibility of the greatest affirmation. Here Professor Laurie presents the proofs for individual immortality in perhaps their best form, but still he is forced to admit himself dissatisfied. There can be no complete proof. The only safe ground for such arguments is to regard immortality as a special case of continuity and therefore, in so far as man by striving attains unity with God, he is partaking of immortality in this present life. H. E. WEAVER. La liberti et les ihe'nomenes d'automatisme. A. WESSELS. Rev. de Ph., IX, 7, PP. 45-59. Spinoza says that a drunken or irritated man thinks himself the more free the less he is so. This illusion is probably due to ignorance of the causes of action. Richet claims that liberty is a creation of ignorance. Is it true, then, that deterministic psychology is destructive of liberty ? Even the liberty claimed by theology is conditioned. According to scholastic doctrine the will is the faculty by which we tend toward the absolute good; yet, to be free, it must also have the power to choose the bad. The per- fect good is the final end of the will, but imperfect goods are the means to this end. Reason compares and judges, and the will chooses. But the action of the mind depends upon the state of the body, particularly of the</page><page sequence="4">No. i.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 99 brain, and if the brain is injured free action is lost. It is absent also dur- ing infancy, in sleep, frenzy, anger and the hypnotic state. Hypnotic differs from ordinary sleep in that the sleeper retains the power of motion and communicates with his hypnotizer. The latter's influence lasts after the subject awakens from his sleep; and, suggestion still being effective, the will is not free. But the subject does not always believe himself to be act- ing freely, and when he does so the illusion is aided by the struggle between the suggestion and other motives, and by the fact tfiat the subject is free to carry out the action in his own way as regards details. lt would be un- scientific to deny all freedom of the will because the actions of the hypno- tized are determined. Hypnotism is an abnormal and exceptional state. The normal man can compare, appreciate, and judge, and he is therefore free. HELEN M. CLARKE. La notion de vkritk dans le fragmatisme. F. BLANCHE. Rev. de Ph., IX, 7, PP- 5-25. The claim that there are thirteen pragmatisms, or again, that there are as many as the sands of the sea, is a manifest exaggeration, and based upon a failure to distinguish pragmatism proper from pragmatic tendencies. There are variations in the statements of different writers, as is to be ex- pected in any new theory, but the general tendency is the same in all. Pragmatists agree essentially in the following points. I. Truth is dynamic, not static. Ideas are not in themselves true or false, but become so as they do or do not succeed in reestablishing harmony in a strained mental situation. 2. The truth of an idea consists of its consequences. To prove a proposition, one must apply it. Pragmatists differ, however, as to whether an idea is true because it leads to a real or useful object. 3. The meaning of an idea depends upon the purpose of the thinker. A human interest is *a vital condition of the existence of truth; that is, to " I have consequences " is to have them for some being. 4. The world is plastic and may be moulded by our desires and beliefs, while it, in turn, reacts upon them. These articles of the pragmatic creed may be collected into one statement, as follows: Truth is the phenomena which characterizes an affirmation, when the consequences corresponding to the purpose which determines the meaning of the affirmation are realized. The pragmatist is by no means the first to demand verification, but he is the first to hold that verification makes a statement true, instead of merely showing the truth which existed before. James is right in showing that mere similarity between things does not give truth. Yet one thing does not try to copy another, while this copying is precisely the function of tan idea. Without the thing that it represents and a perceived relation to it, the idea itself is merely an object. It is this definite relation to reality which the intellectualist calls the truth of an idea, and it must exist before verification and therefore cannot de- pend upon it. If ideas were changed by verification they would be in a</page><page sequence="5">100 THE PHIL OSOPHIC 4L REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. continual flux and proof would be a process without end or law. Pragma- tists could gain their cause only if they could show that verification entirely creates the object of our ideas, but this they do not claim. They recognize an existing objective element and this element, however slight, refutes their theory. The pragmatic theory of verification is valid only for synthetic judgments. Purpose may qualify the real but it does not change its nature. Truth is not a phenomenon but a relation. HELEN M. CLARKE. Kants Lehre vom Ding an sicA. ANNA TUMARKIN. Ar. f. G. d. Ph., XV, 3, Pp. 29I-3 i8. The doctrine of the thing-in-itself has been the most contested point in the Kantian philosophy. How can that which is above and beyond the reach of the categories, of causality, be the condition and ground of our sensibility ? The whole Schulze-Schopenhauerian critique centers in this objection. For Kant, the representative material is given' in sensi- bility: it becomes objective experience only when shaped into conceptual form by the understanding. Sensibility and subjectivity are synonymous for Kant. But to explain the origin and possibility of our affections and our relating understanding, would require a still different sort of under- standing and perception. Moreover, Kant himself seeks to establish the reality of our knowledge not through the metaphysical determination of transcendent things,' but through the transcendental unity of our own consciousness. The transition from the first to the second attitude marks the progress of Kant's philosophical development. Whoever seeks reality in things-in-themselves beyond experience, as the ground and starting-point of our knowledge, misapprehends the spirit of the new Kantian statement of the problem. Starting from the subject, Kant finds in the forms of con- sciousness the determinations of reality: the experiential world thus estab- lished he regards as epistemologically true, the only true world for us finite beings. His is an epistemological monism. The thing-in-itself is not the ajFizierende Reale. The author examines the views of Riehl and Cohen on this point and finds Kant's own answer to the problem in his distinc- tion between theoretical and practical knowledge, in his ' primacy of prac- tical reason.' Kant needed the notion of a Thing independent of the laws of experience, in order to save his practical ideals of Freedom, Im- mortality, and God. This is the motive which, for ethical considerations, necessitated the introduction of an incongruous, transcendent element in Kant's experiential theory of knowledge. The noumenon which, episte- mologically, has at best only a negative significance, assumes here a posi- tive meaning based upon the indubitable ' reality' of the ethical postulates. Looking from this new vantage ground retrospectively, we see the experi- ence of epistemology characterized as ' only' experience; space and time become ' only' phenomenal, and the subjectivity of theoretical knowledge,</page><page sequence="6">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. I0I 'merely' subjective. The incongruity of the two methods is obvious. The true Kantian interpretation of the present day cannot fail to recognize the transcendent Ding-an-sich as an element out of place in Kant's theory of knowledge, an element whose proper source is to be found in the ' prac- tically' grounded ethical postulates. R. A. TSANOFF. Reflective Judgment. R. A. C. MACMILLAN. Mind, No. 70, pp. 23I- 243. Kant's Critique of Judgment introduced no new conception but elabo- rated an idea which he had entertained through all his works. A Critique of Reflective Judgment is needed only when in its striving for the all-real it falls into antinomies by assuming the form of science and professing to determine objects of its own. This reflection, as immediate feeling, Kant deduces from the power of judgment in two ways: (I) Feeling and judg- ment must be intimately related because each mediates in its respective group, -feeling between knowledge and desire, judgment between con- cepts and reasoning. A concept is a judgment from which the appearance of synthesis has vanished, reason is judgment in which the original syn- thesis has been further developed. Thus concept and judgment are both modes of the faculty of judgment. Judgment, the subsumption of the par- ticular under the universal, may be of two kinds, - that in which both par- ticular and universal are present, and that in which the particular only is present. The first, a special case of the second, is determinant, the second free or reflective. Formal judgment with its free relation between subject and object may thus furnish the type for the free judgment and thereby give the critique a name. (2) Judgment and feeling must be parts of the same mental function, since both are subjective in contradistinction to the objectivity of the others. To sum up, there is something in Kant's deduc- tion of feeling from judgment. Instead of feeling being debased to formal judgment as most critics hold, judgment is elevated to feeling, since, during the proof, it becomes transformed into the Original Synthetic Activity of Mind. The bounds of understanding are not fixed but expand with the advance of science. But how far is this advance to go ? If the ' I think' is the condition of all knowledge it must have a distinct realm of its own, it must be a separate function of the mind. The understanding is advancing, it has already laid hold upon Teleology but this partial hold perhaps only serves to show that Teleology is to be a link between the realm of understanding, namely, Science, and the realm of the spon- taneity of mind, that is, Art, Morality, and Religion. H. E. WEAVER. La logique de l'infini. H. POINCAR1:. Rev. de Met., XVII, 4, pp. 46I-482. Certain logicians have been drawn into antinomies not only when they were considering finite matters but especially when they turn their thoughts</page><page sequence="7">I02 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. to the infinite. In the first case they can easily evade the pitfalls but in the second, where they often blunder unconsciously it is a very different matter. Have the rules of logic been misapplied in these classic contra- dictions or do they merely cease to be valuable beyond the boundary of finite things ? The means used to solve these difficulties are interesting but not entirely satisfactory. Zermelo would establish a set of a friori axioms but it is first necessary to make them uncontradictory. Since there is nothing in the mind upon which to base a demonstration, they are seen to be mere arbitrary constructions. But no proposition concerning infinity can be proven a firiori. It is impossible to reason about objects which cannot be defined in a finite number of words. Dealing in infinite num- bers is senseless. Russell says that the famous antinomies are due to a confusion of the words 'all' and 'any.' As a remedy he imagines a hierarchy of types.' He has defined the difficulty to be overcome but has not entirely overcome it, because his ' hierarchy of types ' presupposes the theory of ordinals. The author proposes to abide by the following rules: (I) Never consider objects definable in a finite number of words. (2) Never suppose that a proposition concerning the infinite must be the deduc- tion or conclusion from one concerning the finite. (3) Avoid all non-pred- icative classifications and definitions. Each of the above systems would teach mathematics without defining the difference between finite and in- finite; and moreover they are unable to show in what this difference con- sists. They commence by telling what they know about the infinite without concerning themselves with this distinction. Such a procedure is psychologically false. The mind does not naturally work that way and the attempt to force it, in spite of the antinomies, is entirely unjustifiable. Russell would doubtless object that he is dealing with logic and epistemol- ogy rather than psychology, to which the author replies that there is no logic and epistemology independent of psychology. HARVEY G. TOWNSEND. Kants Kritik der reinen Vernunf' und die Geschic/hte der P/iiosoj5hie. HEINRICH ROMUNDT. Ar. f. G. Ph., XV, 4, pp. 5I 1-532. Kant intended his Critique of Pure Reason as a propadeutic to the critical metaphysic, -as laying down the fundamental principles and laws under which thought operates and experience is organized. In this sense his Critiques differ from previous systems of philosophy. Kant regarded the history of philosophy as a Vorgesciichte to his own thought'and work. He wrote his Proleoonzena not for scholars, " to whom the history of philosophy is their own philosophy." This apparent relegation of the history of phi- losophy to the second rank has caused those who claim for it the first place, to disparage Kant's knowledge of the pre-critical philosophy. Yet Kant did not undervalue the achievements of his predecessors ; he was a reformer in philosophy, and his Critique marked the reorganization of all philosophical thought. Starting out from Hume's rather exaggerated limitation of the ra-</page><page sequence="8">No. i.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 103 tional faculty, Kant held to it in so far as he found it justifiable and capable of philosophical proof. Three stages in the development of metaphysical theory can be marked out. In the first place, we have the consciousness of a faculty of knowledge, reaching out to all that is possibly given in per- ception and in experience. A second stage consists in the infallible opposi- tion to the ' given ' in perception and in experience: the antithesis of the former position. A third attitude, finally, combining greater caution with boldness, corresponds to the true abiding position of man in nature. These are the three natural steps in Metaphysics as Kant recognized them in the history of philosophy no less than in the development of his own thought. " Philosophy," he writes, " is a gradual evolution of human reason - to be sure, by means of mere concepts." Romundt, following partly in the steps of Zeller, traces the development of ancient philosophy from this point of view, - from Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, and the early natural philosophers, through Protagoras, the antithesis of the former, scepticism, the sophists, to the thought of Socrates and his successors, whose synthesis of inadequately partial philosophical positions was at once the reform of old thought and the foundation of a new philosophy. In modern philosophy Hume is the Protagoras: he represents the sceptic attitude. With him (as with Protagoras, according to Zeller), philosophy had apparently come to a standstill. Kant set the ship of thought which had " run aground upon the strand of scepticism " once more afloat. The seeming " end of all philosophy," in Protagoras and in Hume, was in both cases transcended through a synthetizing, reform-working philosophical method, and the consequent establishment of a " new " philosophy. The evolution of Greek thought from Thales to Socrates, as Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis, illustrates Kant's Dreis/ufengese/z for the history of philos- ophy. Romundt critcises Zeller's attitude towards this point of view. R. A. TSANOFF. Synthetische Urteile a/s Einheit von Abhdngigen. CAY VON BROCKDORFF. V. f. w. Ph., XXXIII, ii, pp. i85-i98. The real problem in Kant's question: II How are synthetic judgments a firiori possible ?" is contained in the how. That synthetic judgments are possible follows from the very meaning of synthesis, of judgment, of possibility. Kant's own conception of synthetic judgments is famous: they are judgments that expand the thought-content of the subject, mean- ingful judgments, Erwei/erungsurteile. Naturally, every thought process involves both synthesis and analysis: the two are necessarily complement- ary. Purposiveness in nature is an epistemological postulate. But the teleological involves the mechanical, and vice versa: both having their limits, unable though we may be to assign those limits properly. Synthesis enters here as an equation of non-identicals, not as an identification of equalities. The opposition between the teleological and the antiteleo- logical can never be transcended: but we can understand its significance,</page><page sequence="9">104 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. as an opposition of phases of experience, rather than an absolute opposi- tion. y2 =fiX, signifies: y would be equal to x, If it is squared, and zf bi= -I. The identity is conditional, not absolute: it depends. Coming now to the a friori character of synthetic judgments, -it implies forms of thought which necessitate judgments and concepts admittedly non-em- pirical. Thus, causality can be an a fiosteriori concept, and material for judgments a fiosteriori, only for an infinite consciousness. For finite minds it is only a presupposition of thought, unifying and rendering intel- ligible an otherwise chaotic experience. The same is true of all a priori concepts. The sum-total of experience cannot be embraced in a judgment a fiosteriori. Our particular judgments deal with phases of experience, phases that involve differences and antitheses. A process of organization characterizes the working of thought -: it makes for unity amidst differences: this is the essential nature of all synthesis. R. A. TSANOFF. Zur Analyse der schififerischen Phantasie. RICHARD MULLER-FREIEN- FELS. V. f. w. Ph., XXXIII, 3, PP. 312-360. It is impossible to resolve the works of genius entirely into the factors of age, nationality, environment, etc., as certain positivistic writers have main- tained, and yet one can arrive at a general scientific description of the cre- ative imagination, differing, as it does, not in kind but only in degree from the ordinary productive imagination. It is difficult sharply to differentiate this from the reproductive imagination or memory. In general, it may be said that the latter is characterized by a larger complex of ideas which are recognized as arising from the past, and by a connection with the idea of self. While the creative imagination is dependent on memory for its material, still it is a memory in which the facts are not given in their original connection but have become dissociated from the given complex and then associated with a wealth of other ideas. Creation means the transformation of the elements of experience by their organization with the ideas in the mind of the artist. The laws of association of ideas utterly fail to give any actual, causal explanation such as may be of service in determining the course of thought, from a knowledge of the present mo- ments of consciousness. The subconscious plays a role in the associating of ideas which is, doubtless, especially great in the case of the artist. Association by resemblance seems to be the most important form. Feel- ings are not only an incentive to the activity of the creative imagination but also furnish it with an additional source of material. Yet, in order to be able to objectify the feeling of love or grief, the artist must already have transcended it. It is often urged that it is the ability to express an experi- ence in word, color, or tone which distinguishes the creative from the ordinary imagination. This is a false conception, since the technique, far more than any other of the characteristics, may be acquired by proper training. A natural aptitude for expression, no doubt, often accompanies</page><page sequence="10">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 105 a lively imagination, yet history presents many names of creative genius, who never became masters of technique. Creative activity presupposes not only mental concentration but also a physical condition, described as 'Rausch,' in which all vital activities are at a maximum, as is manifested especially in the rush of blood to the head and quickened pulse and breathing. This condition may arise spontaneously, be due to unusual emotional experiences or be induced artificially by means of narcotics, per- fumes or other odors. It differs only in degree from the ordinary experi- ences, in which one seems to transcend the immediate and factual, and secures that broader and deeper view of the meaning of life, which gives a a feeling of power for the achievement of greater things. This does not lead to positive results more frequently, because there is lacking, not only the training necessary for the expression of the vision, but also ideas of such a character and variety that they may be crystallized into a work of art. It is impossible to explain the process by which ideas are transformed and organized into art products, not because some mystical or supernatural power is at work, but because the factors are too numerous and too com- plex to be discovered or evaluated. All of the phenomena, which mani- fest themselves in the production of a work of art as well as in the creative imagination, are present in the mental life of the ordinary man, only that the difficulty of explanation is emphasized in the former case. At no time and in no particular are we able to explain actual experience in terms of pure psychical causality. The criterion of a work of imagination is not that it be something objectively new, which had not hitherto been known to anyone, but that it be original to the mind of the particular person. Genius is not necessarily characterized by originality, for this is, in a certain sense, one-sidedness. It is not those who accidentally maintain an advanced point of view, that most serve the cause of progress, but those who take that necessary step forward to which the historical development leads. EDWARD L. SCHAUB. Les Theories de Z'a/ention. N. VASCHIDE AND R. MEUNIER. Rev. de Ph., IX, 8, pp. 119-139. The writer tries to explain, criticise and finally reconstruct different theories of attention. M. Ribot is taken as the representative of the peri- pheral motor and affective theory. According to this theory attention is not a faculty, but an intellectual state. It depends upon the previous affective state, which respectively can be reduced to a tendency, founded on a con- scious or unconscious movement, so that attention, whether spontaneous or voluntary, in the last resort is due to motor conditions. Attention for him is mono-idea, that is, in the state of attention we cannot have two ideas at the same time. Nevertheless, it is preceded by a poly-idea of affective state, that is, in the state of affective process we cannot have just one idea. The state of attention is always accompanied by many physical manifesta-</page><page sequence="11">io6 THE PRILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIX. tions, namely, of vaso-motor phenomena, respiratory phenomena, muscular contraction, etc. These accompaniments are taken as the essence of atten- tion, not as mere accompaniments. Voluntary attention concerns rather exceptional mental facts, in which mental energy is concentrated in a certain part of the brain. There were many objections raised to this theory. M. Marillier attacks it, and believes that attention can be explained by the difference of intensity of representations. Not the motor center, but the sensorial center plays the essential part in attention. Representations in general have about equal intensity, but some of them obtain predominance through very complex conditions, such as association, sensibility, dynamogeny of cortical centers, etc. There are many cases in which motor centers show a greater im- potance than sensorial centers, but in most cases the muscular movements are in direct consequence of the other centers. What people call motor attention is the adaptation of movements to an act determined. When a motor center is stimulated more strongly than the others the above adapta- tion is easily produced. But motor centers and sensorial centers are rather independent of each other, and adaptation of this sort can be effected in the former. Attention cannot be produced by affective states, because no matter what affective process may accompany representations they can produce attention. Voluntary attention is simply an attention with the struggle of representations. This theory is called the sensorial theory of attention. Dr. Creibig takes attention for an expression of mind. In the case of voluntary attention we can introspect this fact without difficulty. The fact that we cannot introspect in the case of spontaneous attention is easily explained by the impossibility of long continuation of introspection. M. Aars takes up this problem with the same spirit. For the solution of this problem the relation between attention and volition is extremely important. Now the state of attending is just this relation between the above two. These can be called voluntary theories of attention. M. Rageot thinks that attention is characterized, not by affective proc- esses, but on the contrary by the silence of any affective state. There are three ways of reacting to the environment for an organism: simple reflex, organic tendency, either hereditary or acquired, and proper attention state. Attention is not mono-ideaism, but pre-ideaism, that is, it is a perception in its formation. As soon as an excitation is transformed into a move- ment or inhibition attention disappears. If the interior factor in a mental fact is stronger than the exterior factors it causes attention, while if the con- dition is contrary it causes sensation. M. Nayrac proposes a central theory of attention. Effort and volition are in reality one mental fact. Our brain, considered physiologically, cannot stay passive, so that in the above phenomena the central factor forms attention. The writer concludes by remarking that through these criticisms M.</page><page sequence="12">No. I.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 107 Ribot's motor peripheral theory is entirely invalidated; for it is true that attention is closely connected to affective state, that it seems to be of central origin, that it is essentially dynamic, and, last of all, it is not an excep- tional mental fact, as M. Ribot maintains, but is the most universal fact in mental phenomena. T. OKABE. Revue Critique de Morale. G. MICHELET. Rev. de Ph., IX, 6, pp. 690 -711 ; 9, pp. 289-314. After remarking that the tendency of the books and articles of recent date treating the subject of morality is to scorn philosophy as a basis, and that nevertheless they set up a philosophy of their own, M. Michelet proceeds to give a concise account of the ethical systems presented in nine different books and to criticise each. M. de Lanessan, in Morale na/urelle, presents a materialistic ethics. For him, matter and motion explain the universe; nutrition, reproduction, and activity are at the bottom of all human and animal motives ; and human and animal minds should be treated in psychology as continuous. But the comparative psychology of the book, according to Professor Miche- let, is too narrow and dogmatic. Instincts as well as functions are inherited. Moreover, the attitude adopted on moral questions is so radical as to be almost shocking. M. Bayet, in l'idke de bien, is a sincere iconoclast. He rejects scien- tific morality because it is descriptive, not normative. Yet as a moralist, he would like to influence events while remaining scientific. As adviser, for example, he would indicate the chances of success of any line of conduct. M. Bayet is illogical in wishing to aid humanity to reach its goal without investigating the legitimacy of that goal. Success implies an ideal, and he should be sure that to assist humanity on its way is a justifiable purpose. M. Aslan, in l'exie5rience et l'invention, emphasizes the need of a new rationalistic ethics to meet the decay of faith. As morality cannot be de- rived from the theoretical reason, he would unite rationalistic-idealistic with sociological ethics. Ideals and individual effort are necessary. But M. Aslan is vague, giving no content to his ideal. Following Kant, he has forfeited a metaphysic, without which no adequate ideal is possible. Esqzeisses de morale et de sociologie, by M. Eugene Leroy, is a collection of "choice bits," not always well selected, from various authors. The doctrine presented, that morality is a changing quantity varying with man's social development, the author does not deign to criticise. The Pessimisme, feminisme, moralisme, of Mme. Camille Bos, offers a study of three important, current problems. The usual pessimism is de- rived from the fact that Christianity has led us to hopes which, now dis- trusting it, we do not believe capable of fulfillment. Her pessimism arises from the belief that Christianity offers the only hope there is, and that this is being lost. The spirit of feminism, which may lead to race suicide,</page><page sequence="13">io8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XIX. appears worst when morally considered. By causing aversion to marriage and furthering irregular unions, it may destroy the family. The problems of progress and equality are obscure to Mme. Camille Bos because she no longer has the illumination of traditional spiritualism. The substitution of Maeterlinck's " I Sagesse " for the Bible does not satisfy her, for we seem to go to school to the heart and the soul. In desiring to follow the lead of Christ implicity she will be joined by many of similar temperament, while others will prefer a rational idealism. M. Fouillee, in La morale des idkes-forces, offers a system of ethics in many points unique. Morality is a subjective study by means of which we derive from the consciousness all necessary rules of conduct. We may thus obtain an objective ideal, independent of metaphysics. The first moral act is the objectification of self-consciousness, which attributes it to others. As thought has a universality in its rational aspect, so it has in its moral aspect; and as universality of thought triumphs over particularity, so altruism is a stronger idhe-force than egoism. From the law of the self-reali- zation of ideas, acts are judged by reason as reason, apart from pleasure. Here a contrast is offered to sociological ethics and Kantian dualism. But the system is weak. The thinking of other minds does not create them nor does knowing their existence define duties toward them. Ideas opposed to duty may arise and execute themselves, while finally, the "supreme per- suader" has no more power nor sanctity than a supreme doubt. La morale rationelle dans ses relations avvec la thilosothie generate, by M. Albert, has for its key-note absolute idealism and universal morality. The author is right in adopting both the psychological and metaphysical bases of -ethics. In statement he is vigorous, consistent, and admirable; in exposition, clear. Still the first part of his work, a critical examination of the various systems, is too artificial and cursory to be conclusive. More- over, in his historical study of the evolution of morals he attempts, without success, to prove that peoples generally tend toward a rationalistic moral- ity. He is right, however, in making morality the mainstay of society and not its product. But the proof of the morality of the universe from that of thought cannot be sustained. L'Ideal moderne, by M. Paul Gaultier, is a sort of apology for the ideals of Christianity. Science seems unable to furnish an ethical ideal, while metaphysics is shunned. The establishment of an ethical system must be by the harmonization of pagan hedonism and Christian idealism. The chapter on the primacy of the individual to society is good; but when M. Gaultier would have morality lead to religion and to God, the fact must be noted that it can lead to Him only if we suppose Him, for it can give us no assurance of His existence. That religion aids morality, however, is cor- rectly pointed out, and the work is, on the whole, commendable. The pamphlet, La morale est elle une science, by M. Chollet, can be spoken of only in terms of praise. It is analytic and suggestive in char- acter, summarizing and criticising ethical theories. In way of positive con-</page><page sequence="14">No. i.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 109 tribution, it indicates that the ideal principle necessary, depends upon ideas of man, God, and the world. Social conditions may change the ideal but not create or destroy it. The traditional morality,- the Christian,- may be applied to any situation for it has eternal elements. G. W. PORTER. The Ethical Szgxnfcance of the Idea Theory, L. R. M. MACIVER. Mind, No. 72, pp. 552-569. In this and a succeeding paper, Mr. MacIver announces " that he is at- tempting to show how a perception of the fundamentally ethical quality of Plato's thought explains the rise, the development, and the modification of his Idea theory." Indeed it is everywhere recognized that the teleological explanation, where possible, is the ultimate explanation. Science, never- theless, rightly rejects teleology in its experimental work, but it is far exceed- ing its province when it proceeds to deny the ultimate value of such an explanation, where, in the experience of our own activity, it is manifestly the most complete explanation. With splendid insight, Plato saw that this explanation in relation to a purpose is ultimate for knowledge. For him, the ethical is by no means secondary. He began by making the good one, and ended by making it alt. The ethical claim is primarily for the secur- ity of the good, and while it must acknowledge the present reality of evil, it denies its right existence and predicts its ultimate annihilation. Logical grounds also appear for regarding the concepts of beauty and goodness as fundamental. In the first place, other universals cover only a part of the nature of that thing to which they are applied. "An object may hold not-white attributes without any diminution of its whiteness, but can it hold not-good attributes without having its goodness thereby limited?" Sec- ondly, as complete knowledge demands comprehension under one concept, and as good appears as the all-comprehensive concept, therefore the knowl- edge of the good is the completest knowledge of reality. By a careful analysis and interpretation of Socrates's own account of his transition from the study of phenomenal science to noumenal science (Phaedo, 976 sq.) the author concludes that certainly for Socrates and Plato, the teleological explanation is the ultimate principle of all knowledge. " If we can ex- plain the abiding, or the universal, . . . we shall have shown the goodness or the reason of the permanent in its permanence, instead of in its tran- sient manifestation,- we shall have understood reality." So Plato's Idea- system as a coherent whole takes as its basis the principle that whatever we know is what it is because that is for the best, and that whatever becomes, becomes for the best, in short, that every efficient cause is for the sake of a fully rational final cause. Two problems remain,-the problem of change and the problem of evil,- and these appear insoluble on the Idea- system as so far conceived. A treatment of Plato's consideration of these problems is indicated as the theme of the succeeding article. GEORGE T. COLMAN.</page></plain_text>
