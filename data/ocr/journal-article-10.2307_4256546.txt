ANDREW MCDONALD Now that man has become like one of us in knowing good from evil, he must not be allowed to reach out his hand and pick from the tree of life too, and eat and live forever! ... (so god) banished the man, and in front of the garden of Eden he posted the great winged creatures and the fiery flashing sword, to guard the way to the tree of life. (Genesis 2:21-24) Early myths and religious beliefs that account for the origin of life and human aspirations to attain immortality are often ignored or scorned by natural historians, as they tend to contradict modem Darwinian views of natural creation and current biological understandings of the aging process. Allusions to an immortalizing 'tree of life' in the mythic traditions of Mesopotamia, the Levant, and India are therefore thought to arise from the hopeful and imaginative yearn- ings of superstitious peoples rather than histor- ical realities. Linguists and comparative mythol- ogists have long recognized, nevertheless, that references to such a plant appear recurrently in mythic, artistic, and historical records of Indo- European, Semitic and Hamitic peoples (Cam- bell 1991:9-17; Cook 1974; James 1966:129- 162; Parpola 1993). This observation convinces some commentators that ancient beliefs in an immortalizing 'plant of the gods' may have a material or logical basis in human history. Some historians have hypothesized that the concept of a tree of immortal life derives from the wide- spread practice of ingesting psychotropic plants to heighten or distort human perceptions of re- ality (Ruck 1986; Ruck, Staples, and Heinrick 2001; Schultes 1992; Smith 2000; Wasson 1986). Whether this is this is the case or not, no single plant has ever been identified that could have served the same purpose for so many dif- ferent peoples throughout Europe and Asia. SACRED TREES IN THE VISUAL ARTS Visual renderings of a symbolic 'tree of life' in the arts of the Near and Middle East from the 3rd-1st millenium BCE portray a plant whose physical attributes are generally consistent with mythical traditions of the region. They depict a pillared plant that grows from an aquatic medi- um or world-mountain toward the image of a sun (Fig. la, c-e; Danthine 1937, Fig. 139, 176, 254, 691-696). This plant is often illustrated in a narrative context, usually in association with a host of divine human figures, snakes, eagles, li- ons, bulls, or leogryphs. Early depictions of the motif on cylinder seals from the 3rd millenium BCE are usually too poorly preserved or stylized in their execution to allow for a botanical inter- pretation (Frankfort 1939, Pls. 4j, 13e, h; Par- pola 1993), but later interpretations of the plant during the late 2nd millenium BCE are increas- ingly amenable to botanical scrutiny. Renderings that date from the 1st millenium BCE allow, in fact, for a species determination. Since late por- trayals of the plant are normally regarded as re- finements on earlier interpretations (James 1966; Parpola 1993), it is reasonable to assume that a botanical assessment of later materials is rele- vant to those of older origin. Two distinctive forms of this mystical 'world- tree' are preserved on cylinder seals from the 2nd millenium BCE. One basic tree type is portrayed as a columnar plant that supports a luminescent object (Fig. la); another is depicted as a rami- fied, monopodial treelet (Fig. lb, d). The former type presents a naked trunk that is generally lacking of lateral branches, save for a pair of opposing horn-like offshoots at the apex of the plant which most art historians are inclined to interpret as a crescent moon. In like manner, a radiate structure that is cradled by the plant's horizontal crescent is normally interpreted as a solar, lunar or astral motif (Fig. la; Danthine 1937, Fig. 188, 189, 438, 497, 498, 502-504).

This image is often associated with a host of divine human figures, one prevailing form of which is rendered with a naked body, elongated face, broad nose, curly tresses, a beard, and rounded crown (Fig. la, b). This man is often accompanied by a variety of animalian spirits and fully robed anthropomorphic gods and god- desses, the latter of whom tend to congregate about the sacred plant to pay homage, often in association with aquatic environments (Fig. la; Danthine 1937, Fig. 139, 176, 254) or upon the tree's cosmic mountain (Danthine 1937, Fig. 502, 624, 625, 683, 691-695). The predominant naked figure often subjugates lions, bulls and leogryphs by hoisting the mythical creatures into the air by their hind legs or tails (Fig. lb, 5c). While the underlying meaning of this bold pos- ture is still not fully understood, it seems to re- late in some way to the gaining of access to the sacred tree (Fig. la, b, d, e, 2d, 5a, b). In like manner, the subordinate animals appear to play a dualistic role in Middle Eastern iconography, as either protectors or devotees of the divine plant. In the latter capacity they conventionally carry a short-handled pail (or purse?) in one hand and a vegetative motif in the other (Fig. la, d, e). They perform an act of consecration that historians are given to interpret as an 'anointing,' 'smearing' or 'watering' of the sa- cral tree (Black and Green 1992:16, 170; Frank- fort 1939:204, 1989:160-162; Goldsmith 1928: 101). These same mythical figures congregate around a cosmic tree that produces opposite, ti- ered offshoots (Fig. lb-e, 2a). Lateral branches of this sacred tree often bear stalked palmettes in their axils (Fig. lb, c, e, 2d, Sa, b) and styl- ized hooks, volutes, fruits or cone-like structures at their tips (Fig. lb, c, d, 2d, 4a, b; see also Black and Green 1992:80; Danthine 1937, Fig. 380, 407, 409-412, 580). This particular tree is clearly distinguished on a morphological basis from its pillared and branchless counterpart, yet historians are inclined to recognize it as a variant rendering of the branchless tree (Fig. la), as we occasionally encounter hybrid motifs that exhib- it vegetative nuances of both tree types (Parpola 1993, appendix A, pp. 200-201). Moreover, we observe the same bizarre sphinxes and personi- fied griffins performing the same unusual rites on both motifs (Fig. la, d, 2d, 5b). By the middle of the 1st millenium BCE we note that the sacral tree has undergone few changes, as the plant still exhibits a naked, co- lumnar trunk, a palmate canopy, and close con- tacts with the sun, winged humans, or various animalian spirits (Fig. le, 2a, c, Sb). Though still stylized at this late date, some of the plant's veg- etative features are now executed with increas- ing realism, as exemplified by the sacral trees of Assurnasirpal II at Nimrud and Nineveh during the 9th c. BCE (Fig. le, 2a). These large (1-2 m tall) and detailed interpretations of the archaic tree can be traced from wall paintings of the same motif at Kar Tukulti-Ninurti during the 12th century BCE (Frankfort 1989; Fig. 152, 153), and match closely to renderings of the tree on ivory fragments of contemporaneous age (Fig. lc, 2d, Sb). A general consensus has been reached that all of these vegetative motifs are symbolic of power, fertility and everlasting life, yet there is little agreement as to how the images relate specifically to religious beliefs and myths of Mesopotamia and the Near East (Parpola 1993). Archeologists and art historians often identify these motifs as stylized date palms (Fig. 2a), ow- ing primarily to the plant's palm-like aspect and to the importance of dates in the diets and local economies of Middle Eastern cultures (Danthine 1937; James 1966:98; Mazar 1961, 4:71; Par- pola 1993; Porter 1993; Tylor 1890). Other com- mentators prefer, however, to refer to these sym- bolic images as 'pillars of heaven' (Frankfort 1939:276; 1989:248, 296), 'palmetto trees' (Keel and Uehlinger 1998:199, 234), or 'Cyp- riote palmettes' (Frankfort 1989:323), so as to emphasize their magical significance. Labels of the latter type are often used, for example, in reference to sacral trees that are encountered on reliefs inside Assurnasirpal's temples during the 9th century BCE (Fig. le, 2a), since the general appearance of these executions do not suggest the image of a date palm per se. While Assur- nasirpal's trees do possess a pillared trunk and palmate canopy, we note that a series of small palmettes surround the tree in an array that is inconsistent with palm morphology. The small palmettes are linked by smooth and pliable stems that tie off directly to the plant's pillared axis, ostensibly to establish a visual relationship between the repeating palmettes and the sacral</page><page sequence="4">116 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 56 4 0*~~~~~~~~~~~~ (N7 7 Fig. 2. a-d.

BCE (British Museum).</page><page sequence="5">2002] McDONALD: DETERMINATION OF MIDDLE EASTERN TREE OF LIFE 117 tree's canopy (Fig. 2a, c). We also note that the cluster of appendages that comprise each pal- mette do not suggest the morphology of a date palm's pinnate blades (Fig. 3a), but rather a sim- ple, narrowly elliptical, foliaceous structure (Fig. Ic, e, 2a, b, 4d, f, Sb, 6a). Hence one is hesitant to identify the plant's palmate spray of 'leaves' as a palm canopy. To further question this as- sociation, we note that the ropy stems of the plant occasionally give rise to a peculiar fruit that bears no resemblance to a date (Fig. 4b, d, f; Danthine 1937: Fig. 426, 428, 431, 440, 448). On other occasions the stylized bower produces a series of stylized strobiloid structures (Fig. lb, 6a-c; Danthine 1937, Fig. 380, 407, 409-412, 482, 490, 580, 821; Loud 1939, Pls. 20, 21), which art historians are apt to identify as 'cones', 'pine-cones', or 'pineapples' (Black and Green 1992:46; Menant 1888:64, P1. VIII,X; Parpola 1993:183). These recurrent features are also discordant with physical attributes of a date- palm. Assumasirpal's trees maintain a close sym- bolic association with the sun, but at this point in time the solar orb is removed from the boughs of the plant and placed above the motif in the form of a winged disk (Fig. le, 2c). A divinity that emerges from the center of the winged orb is normally interpreted as one of various sun- gods that were worshipped by the Sumerians, Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians and Perso- Aryans, known variously as Utu, Shamash, As- sur, Marduk or Ahura Mazda (Black and Green 1992:129, 182-184, 186). It has proven difficult, however, to identify which of these gods is de- picted specifically in Assurnasirpal's palaces at Nimrud and Nineveh, since the same winged- sun motif has been employed by many and var- ious cultures throughout the fertile crescent from the 3rd-1st millenia BCE. Furthermore, all of the aforementioned divinities share close mythic and iconographic affinities with an immortaliz- ing tree of life (see below). Although we occasionally encounter the un- mistakable image of a date palm on temple re- liefs and cylinder seals that commemorate his- torical scenes [i.e., as deduced by their columnar trunks, persistent leaf bases, pinnate leaves, and spathate inflorescences (Fig. 3a; see also Dan- thine 1937, Fig. 13, 14, 18, 19, 25-27; Roaf 1998:189, 190)], images of date palms are only rarely associated with mythical scenes (Danthine 1937, Fig. 15, 16, 20, 24, 31, 34). Religious and fantastical scenes usually employ a highly styl- ized interpretation of the world-tree, which, as earlier noted, is often surrounded by an arching network of supple, succulent stolons (Fig. lb, e, 2a, c, d, 4d, f, 5b, 6c). Or more importantly, we notice that the sacral tree's palmettes are fre- quently drawn across a horizontal plane (Fig. 2b, d, 4d, f, 6c), in which arrangement they seem to suggest a floral motif rather than a branching canopy. This specific association is clearly im- plied on a stone panel that once decorated a doorway of Assurnasirpal's chambers (Fig. 2b), where horizontal alignments of repeating pal- mettes are unequivocally equated with a lotus bud-and-blossom motif. The frequent association of lotus blossoms and palmettes in the visual arts of the Middle East is of critical importance for several reasons. First, the classical lotus bud-and-blossom motif that we encounter in Egypt as early as 3000 BCE and in Mesopotamia by the second millen- ium BCE is widely recognized as a symbol of rebirth and immortal life. Hence the symbolic inference of a sequential bud-and-blossom motif agrees conceptually with the metaphorical con- cept of an immortal 'tree of life'. Secondly, we note that Mesopotamian palmettes are usually subtended by a pair of lateral volutes with a del- toid or rounded appendage fixed between them (Fig. Ic, 2a, c, 5a, b, 6c). This conventional fea- ture of a palmette suggests that we are not deal- ing with a palm canopy, but rather a tetramer- ous, polypetalous flower that displays three of its four sepals in profile (Fig. 2b, 3d, 4a, 5c, 6b). If this is the case, then we are compelled to iden- tify the 'sacral tree' of Mesopotamia as a styl- ized lotus shoot rather than a palm tree, for flow- ers of the Egyptian lotus (Nymphaea nouchalii Burm. f.; = N. caerulii Savigny pro syn.; Verd- court 1989) are large, tetramerous, and solitary (Fig. 3c, d). In contrast, flowers of a date palm are miniscule, hexamerous, and born numerous- ly on a highly ramified, spathate inflorescence (Fig. 3a). Hence it follows that the columnar axis of the sacral tree does not represent the woody trunk of a date palm (Fig. 3a), but rather an upright, naked, succulent lotus stalk (Fig. 2c, d, 3c, d, 4e). Mesopotamian artisans often placed stalked palmettes in the hands of dignitaries and en- throned kings on temple reliefs (Danthine 1937, Fig. 904-908, 914, 924, 1095; Frankfort 1989, Fig. 231, 358; Mazar 1961, 11:143, 270; Roaf</page><page sequence="6">118 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 56 .'.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. ..'

Since flowers of the Egyptian lotus are blue-pigmented, and those of a date palm cream-colored, we may be sure that the pal- mettes were intended to represent a stylized lo- tus flower.</page><page sequence="8">120 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 56 a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ _ 1.1~~~~~W 1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ E L~~~~~~~~~~~~~~J L ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i Fig. 5. a-d.

Note that the chimera</page><page sequence="9">2002] McDONALD: DETERMINATION OF MIDDLE EASTERN TREE OF LIFE 121 Numerous ivory engravings and figurines of Phoenician origin lend credence to a floral in- terpretation of the sacral tree's palmettes. An ex- emplary specimen from Assurnasirpal's palace at Nimrud portrays, for example, a winged sphinx striding across a lotus bud-and-blossom motif as he approaches a tree of life (Fig. 2d). Although this damaged fragment does not pro- vide a clear view of the plant's pillared trunk, we do observe the conventional hooked branch- es of the sacral tree. We also pay heed to alter- nating lotus buds and flowers that sprout from the tips of lateral shoots (Fig. ic, 5a, b; see also Danthine 1937 for hundreds of examples, and Mazar 1961, 11:214, 215 for examples from Sa- maria and Megiddo, Israel). We note that the griffin has placed one forepaw upon a full-blown lotus flower as he extends another protective paw toward a blue-pigmented lotus bud on the sacred tree. Hence the upwardly mounting, styl- ized buds and blossoms on the tree clearly mir- ror the image of a lotus bud-and-blossom motif that runs along the lower border of the fragment. The symbolic equivalency of the palmette and lotus blossom is further implied by placing al- ternating images of a solitary fruit between each flower (Fig. 4a, d, f; D'Alviella 1956, Fig. 63, 64, PI. IV). This fruit is consistently rendered with an ovoid pericarp and persistent, clasping sepals. While art historians and botanists are in- clined to identify the fruit as a pomegranate, Punica multiflora Hort. (Avigad 1990; Halpern 1992; Keel and Uehlinger 1998:360; Moldenke and Moldenke 1952:191-192), there is ample reason to question this determination. For one, pomegranates share no ecological relationship with date palms in the natural world, except for the fact that they are both semi-domesticated species. Secondly, pomegranate plants share few, if any, morphological characteristics with a palm tree (Fig. 3a, b). Finally, we note that fruits of the sacral tree are often incorporated into styl- ized configurations of palmettes and lotus motifs in Mesopotamia (Fig. 4d, f) and Egypt (Fig. 4a), suggesting that the fruit may share a symbolic relationship with water lilies. Indeed, an Assyr- ian dignitary that dangles a cluster of three sa- cral fruits (Fig. 4b) is preceded on the same re- lief by a king that holds three lotus flowers in hand (Frankfort 1989, Fig. 199; see also Dan- thine 1937, Fig. 119, 914). This historical scene confirms that Mesopotamian artisans recognized some sort of biological or symbolic relationship between the stylized fruit and lotus flower in re- ligious rituals. Indeed, if we consider the peculiar morphol- ogy of the distinctive fruit, we recognize that the fruiting body is more readily identified as a lotus berry than a pomegranate, since ovoid Nym- phaea berries are always bom at the apex of thick, flexible, succulent shoots, and retain ac- crescent sepals that clasp and surpass the peri- carp (Fig. 4a-f). These diagnostic characteristics accord in every way with fruiting structures of the sacred tree (Danthine 1937: Fig. 423-432, 440, 448), yet they contrast remarkably with pomegranate fruits, which normally develop as lateral shoots on thin, rigid, highly ramified, fo- liaceous stems (Fig. 3b). Hence we are bound to interpret the running palmette-and-fruit motif as a permutation on the lotus bud-and-blossom mo- tif. PHENOLOGICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTISTICS OF THE EGYPTIAN LOTUS The convention of presenting three lotus flow- ers or fruits in the hands of Mesopotamian gods and dignitaries (Fig. 4b, 5d; Danthine 1937, Fig. 488, 524, 818, 909, 913-915, 919) probably de- rives from the ancient Egyptian practice of por- traying lotus blossoms in triplicate (Emboden and sacral tree carry a similar crown that is formed by a sun and moon. A similar crown is observed on the sacral tree's guardian serpents in Fig. lc. Serpentine lotus stems issue from the feet of two personified aquatic divinities. Ft. Shalmaneser, Iraq. 8th c. BCE (Metropolitan Museum New York). c. A lotus-goddess stands upon a lotus flower as she raises a pair of flowers to the sun.

BCE (Metropolitan Museum, New York).</page><page sequence="10">122 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 56 1978, 1989). As noted by Emboden, this custom relates to the natural behavior of lotus flowers, which open and close thrice over the course of three days (Meeuse and Schneider 1979). It is also widely acknowledged that the symbolic re- lationship between the Egyptian lotus and sun is based on the natural color scheme and radial symmetry of lotus blossoms, for flowers of Nymphaea nouchalii display a golden ovarian disk inside a sky-blue corolla (Fig. Ic, 2b, 5c, d, 6b), suggesting the image of a yellow sun in an azure sky. Water lily blossoms also share a close behavioral connection with the sun by the idiosyncratic manner in which they open their petals at dawn and close them before the onset of dusk. Hence Egyptian and Middle Eastern iconographers and mythographers recognized a natural symbolic relationship between their sa- cred flower and the sun. The Egyptian lotus also shares a close sym- bolic association with various mythical serpents known variously as Edjo, Buto, Apep, or Seth. Images of these symbolic creatures appear fre- quently among reliefs of lotus groves the con- ventionally encircle Egyptian temples, or other- wise dangle from blue-winged, solar disks that decorate the hallways and portals of temple in- teriors (Fig. 6c). These standard iconographic forms are apparently based, once again, on the general morphology and natural behavior of lo- tus shoots, as the latter structures bear a distinct likeness to a snake when they emerge from the dark recesses of their aquatic habitats. Their tu- bular stalks suggest the image of a rising ser- pent's body, while their swelling buds suggest the aspect of a serpent's heads (Fig. 3c). Lotus stalks also exhibit a decidedly snake-like behav- ior following the third day of anthesis, when their peduncles recoil in a serpentine fashion to draw their pollinated flowers back into the water (Fig. 3c; Meeuse and Schneider 1979). Contin- ually rising from, and retreating into, the waters of the rivers and lakes, lotus shoots were envis- aged symbolically as the living embodiment of a recurrent sun and serpent: hence the wide- spread Egyptian and Middle Eastern icono- graphic custom of associating coiling snakes with budding and flowering lotus stalks (Fig. la, 2a, b, c, 4b, 5b; see also Danthine 1937, Fig. 152, 377, 615; Gillispie and Dewachter 1987, Vol. 4: P1. 29, 41.2, 67.18; Keel and Uehlinger 1998, Fig. 336). To further develop this sym- bolic relationship, Egyptians often placed the emblem of a sun and moon upon the serpent's head to identify the plant and animal with their sun-like flowers (Fig. Ic, Sc). This same stylistic nuance is frequently encountered in Near East- ern iconography (Fig. la, c, d, Sa, b). The plant's habit of producing a succession of lotus buds, flowers, and fruits is fittingly exem- plified, therefore, by the classic bud-and-blos- som motif or flower-and-fruit configuration (Fig. 2b, d, 4a, d, f, 5a, 6c, 7b). In fact, all of these plant parts were employed as a symbol of vital- ity or eternal life. Images of lotus fruits were often carried by kings and aristocrats in the form of ivory scepters throughout the Middle East (Fig. 4c; Avigad 1990; Halpern 1992), for ex- ample, on a specimen of which has been traced directly to Solomon's temple in Jerusalem (Avi- gad 1990; Halpern 1992). This piece gives us reason to believe that kings of his day may have employed the image of a lotus fruit to signify their close relationship with the tree of life. EGYPTIAN INFLUENCES ON THE SACRAL TREE MOTIF Art historians have long acknowledged that iconographic schools of art in the Near and Mid- dle East were influenced by the Egyptians (Black and Green 1992:84; Cline 1995; Frank- fort 1989; Jones 1986:28-29; Shaw 1992:29), and we frequently encounter the intermingling of Egyptian and Middle Eastern deities and mo- tifs on ancient ivory carvings and metalwork that originate from these regions of the world. We observe, for example, a Near Eastern ren- dering of the tree of life beside an Egyptian- styled lotus blossom on a silver Phoenician bowl (Fig. Sa). These motifs are presented in a myth- ical context by associating the lotus-born Egyp- tian sun-god known as Horus or Harpocrates with a pair of Near Eastern deities, the latter of whom pluck lotus buds and blossoms from the corniculate branches of a sacral tree (Fig. Sa). Similar cross-cultural associations of Egyptian and Near Eastern divinities are observed among a large stash of Phoenician ivories that were un- earthed from Assurnasirpal's palaces at Nimrud and Nineveh. One specimen portrays a winged caprid with recurved horns striding across a lo- tus grove towards a lotus-tree of life (Fig. Sb), his general form and natural surroundings sug- gesting those of the Egyptian capriform sun-god known as Khnum.

Mesopotamian renderings of this god (i.e., at least in form) pressed deep into the heart of Assyria by the turn of the Is' millennium BCE (Danthine 1937, Fig. 185, 237, 387, 489, 707), and continued to maintain their close associa- tions with lotus groves. Like other Middle East- ern and Egyptian deities, he bears a sun and moon upon his head (Fig. 5b); and we note that the goat's headdress mirrors the general aspect of the sacral tree's canopy, presumably to draw a symbolic connection between the mythical plant and animal. A Middle Eastern goddess that is frequently encountered among Assurnasirpal's ivory col- lections (Fig. 5c, d) similarly exhibits the dis- tinctive bodily form and hairstyle of various Egyptian lotus-goddesses (i.e., Maat, Isis, Hath- or, and Nut). In one specimen (Fig. 5c) she seems to represent the female personification of a lotus plant, as her stout body seems to take the place of a lotus stalk when she stands upon</page><page sequence="13">2002] McDONALD: DETERMINATION OF MIDDLE EASTERN TREE OF LIFE 125 a lotus podium to raise her blossoms before an Egyptian-styled sun (Fig. 5c). The goddess grasps two lionesses by the hind legs to signify her feminine prowess and suggest her general equivalency to various masculine gods of the Middle East (Fig. lb). This goddess of vegeta- tion also identifies herself with the sun (Fig. 5d), in which guise she emulates, once again, various masculine sun-gods in Mesopotamia and Persia (Fig. le, 2c; Frankfort 1989, Fig. 428; Rauf 1998:163, 219). Yet she maintains her close as- sociation with the sacred lotus by presenting a pair of buds from her radiant body. While she brings life to the proverbial scion of the sun (i.e., lotus shoots), a priest pays reverence by offering her a bouquet of three lotus buds (Fig. 5d). THE SACRAL TREE IN RELIGIOUS RITUAL As already mentioned, the tree of life is often protected by various chimeric creatures, includ- ing griffins (Fig.la, b, d), winged humans (Fig. le, Sa, 6a), scorpion-men (Frankfort 1939:201, Fig. 33b, c) or fish-men (Black and Green 1992: 83). These hybrid creatures frequently place a cone-like object upon the sacred tree's palmettes or above a king's head (Fig. le, 6a, c; Porter 1993). One current interpretation of this recur- rent visual theme identifies the cone as the sta- minate inflorescence of a palm tree, which some commentators believe was held before the tree and king to simulate the act of fertilization through pollination (Black and Green 1992:46; Porter 1993). This explanation is problematic, however, for several reasons, not least of which is the fact that the cone bears no resemblance whatsoever to a spathate, highly ramified, date palm inflorescence (Fig. 3a). Nor do we ever encounter images of date fruits or palm infruc- tescences in these scenes. That the cone appears at the apex of lateral branches also discounts the notion that the cone represents a plant's flower- ing stalk (Fig. lb; Danthine 1937, Fig. 380, 407, 409-412), since flowering shoots of a date palm invariably dangle below the tree's canopy (Fig. 3a; Danthine 1937, Fig. 409-412, 580). An alternative interpretation of the cone ritual suggests that the king is being atoned or equated with the tree of life (Frankfort 1989:160; Parpola 1995). Whether this is the case or not, we may be sure that the cone relates in some way to the lotus plant, since the structure is frequently as- sociated with lotus stems and flowers on seals and temple reliefs (Fig. 6b, c; see also Danthine 1937, Fig. 380, 407-412, 490; Frankfort 1989: 197; Jones 1986, P1. XII.1,4,14; Menant 1887, P1. VIII.3). One might hypothesize that the cone represents a stylized bud or fruiting shoot of a lotus plant, but neither of these interpretations is entirely satisfying, since imbricate petals of a water lily are never exposed outside of the four tightly clasping sepals, and Nymphaea fruits are always ovoid (Fig. 2b, d, 6b, 7b). Whatever the underlying significance of this puzzling struc- ture, the cone is often displayed as a recurring element in a metamorphosing vegetative struc- ture, and probably relates to the concept of eter- nal recurrence. The enigmatic cones and buckets that are cus- tomarily employed by winged genii in some sort of ritualistic context apparently relate to the giv- ing or taking of life from the sacral tree (Fig. ld, e, 6a). On the Nile River at Beni Hasan we observe the same distinctive bucket in the hands of Egyptian maidens, who employ the imple- ment to harvest lotus flowers and express their juices into large urns (Fig. 7a; Mazar, 1961 II: 123, 111:85, V:85). While archeologists usually suggest that this scene portrays the preparation of perfumes (Lucas 1948:106; Mazar et al. III: 85), there is now reason to believe that the plants were used for different purposes. Recent reports indicate that Nymphaea species produce opiate alkaloids (Diaz 1975) and that these psychotro- pic constituents have been employed by various peoples in ancient Egypt, India and Mexico to induce visions and euphoric states of mind (Em- boden 1978, 1979, 1981, 1989; Nunn 1996:157; Spess 2000). Emboden (1978, 1979, 1981) sug- gests that water lily extracts were employed by Egyptian healers as a shamanistic medium, per- haps in concoctions of poppy and mandrake po- tions, based on recurrent associations of lotus flowers with drinking vessels in libation scenes. Emboden (1979) references various pharmaco- logical studies that identify the narcotic proper- ties and constituents of water lilies (Delphaut and Balansarad 1941; Descourtilz 1829:266; Pobeguin 1912:49), and confirms these reports by personal experimentations with macerated preparations of Egyptian lotus buds and flowers. He reports that he experienced narcosis, altered visual perceptions, and auditory hallucinations. Diaz (1975) later confirmed that Mexican water lilies produce isoquinoline alkaloids, and hy- pothesized that these substances are responsible</page><page sequence="14">126 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 56 for the frequent occurrence of water lilies in mythic and ritualistic scenes on Mayan temples (Dobkin de Rios 1974; Diaz 1977; Emboden 1979, 1983; Rands 1953). More recently Spess (2000) has identified the western and eastern lo- tus (i.e., Nymphaea and Nelumbo, respectively) as psychotropic plants, suggesting that both plants have played a crucial role in the shaman- istic practices of ancient Egypt and Asia. Evidence for the use of lotus extractions in religious ceremonies extends far beyond the banks of the Nile, as we frequently encounter images of the Egyptian lotus in depictions of libations scenes in Mesopotamia, Israel, Leba- non, and Syria (Mazar 1961, 1:121, 11:45, 143, 270, 111.102, IV:96, 140). A famous relief on the palace walls of Assurbanipal (a 6th c. BCE) por- trays, for example, an eventual heir to Assur- nasipal's kingdom with a lotus blossom in one hand and a damaged drinking vessel in the other (Fig. 7d). The sovereign's consort is positioned at the foot of his couch with a petaloid cup in her hand (Frankfort 1989, Fig. 217), suggesting that she drinks directly from a lotus blossom. This image compares closely with a libation scene portrayed on an ivory plaque from Me- giddo, Israel, that dates from the 12th century BCE. Here we observe the presentation of a li- bation cup and lotus blossom to a Canaanite aristocrat (Fig. 7b). The peculiar chair on which this king sits is of notable importance, in that it matches with biblical descriptions of King Sol- omon's 'mercy seat', the sacred throne upon which the famous anointed kings of Yahweh's people sat when they consorted with the ark of the covenant in the holy of holies (Exodus IXX: 19-22; Samuel IV.6, VI.2; 1 Kings XXVII.25; Hebrews IX:5). Indeed, images of the original builder of Solomon's temple in Jerusalem, Hir- am of Tyre (1 Kings V), occupies the same se- raphic throne on his sarcophagus (Mazar 1961, 11:143). And drinks from the same libation cup while holding a lotus in hand, while being sur- rounded by a running lotus bud-and-blossom motif. All of the aforementioned scenes bear close relation to an older relief (13'h c. BCE) at Ras Shamra, Syria, in which a priestess stands before a lotus and libation vase as she pays rev- erence to the father of the Ugaritic pantheon, Seth of Sapon (i.e., Baal; Fig. 7c). Although this scene employs Egyptian imagery and is in- scribed in hieroglyphs, the god to whom the stele is dedicated is decidedly Levantine. THE SACRAL TREE IN MIDDLE EASTERN MYTH Although many scholars have attempted to in- terpret the symbolic meaning of the sacral tree in the visual arts, seldom are efforts made to connect these visual motifs with mythical allu- sions to an immortalizing plant (Roaf 1998:226). Parpola (1993:165) asserts that the sacral tree of Middle Eastern iconographic traditions bears no direct relation to mystical trees in cuneiform texts, but he bases this conjecture on the erro- neous assumption that the plant in question is a date palm. But if we consider that the sacral 'tree' is more accurately conceived as a stout aquatic herb with blue blossoms and a golden ovarian disk, we find ample reason to believe that pictorial representations of the world-tree reflect various mythical themes of the Middle East. Sumerian texts from the mouth of the Ti- gris River describe, for example, a primordial tree of creation that arose from the generative waters of Ur (i.e., near Eridu, Uruk and Eden) with "leaves" the color of lapis lazuli (Jacobsen 1970:1; James 1966:13; Langdon 1928). This plant is called the giz-kin in Sumerian tablets or the kiskannu in Akkadian texts (Langdon 1928). We presently know of no aquatic plants that pro- duce blue foliage, nor do these characteristics apply to riparian palms or pines (James 1966: 13). Yet the blue leaves of this primeval plant may conceivably pertain to the Egyptian lotus, if we interpret the leaves of the kiskannu as the blue, foliose petals of a water lily. The giz-kin or kisannu plant is closely asso- ciated with a riverine deity known as Enki, a Mesopotamian god of wisdom who once plied the banks of the Tigris River on a 'boat of lapis lazuli'. This god of sweet waters also shares close mythical associations with a popular sun- god (Marduk or Shamash), the latter of whom is occasionally identified as the offspring of the river god. Hence the close relation of these three mythical players-water god, sun god and pri- mordial plant-seems to bear a direct relation to the iconographic confluence of these same sym- bolic images (Fig. la, c, d, 2c, Sa, b, c). The Babylonians referred to Enki by the name of Ea, and symbolized this god of waters with the im- age of a pillared ram's head (Black and Green 1992, p. 16). This motif relates, no doubt, to the god's mythic identification with an aquatic drag- on and ibex in the 'watery deep' (abzu) of Eridu</page><page sequence="15">2002] McDONALD: DETERMINATION OF MIDDLE EASTERN TREE OF LIFE 127 (Kramer and Maier 1989:39, 43), and likely bears some relation to the aforementioned image of an aquatic ram that approaches a pillared lo- tus-tree with serpentine stems (Fig. 5b; see also Frankfort 1989, Fig. 152, 225, 287, 296, 379, 393; Keel and Uehlinger 1998, Fig. 52, 53, 219, 223). According to another ancient Sumerian myth, the primordial tree of creation, or huluppu plant, was first plucked from the waters of the Eu- phrates River by a close female associate of Enki, namely Inana, Sumeria's most famous goddess of vegetation (Wolkstein and Kramer 1983:4-9). This goddess cultivated her riverine plant in a holy garden so that it might eventually provide her with a throne and a bed. Unfortu- nately for the Inana, her precious plant was soon inhabited by a serpent in its roots and an anzu- bird in its boughs (much as other immortalizing trees of the ancient Orient). Since these sym- bolic creatures of the Earth and Sky (respective- ly) proved unwilling to share the use of their home with the gods, Inana was forced to enlist the help of her famous mythic brother, Gilga- mesh, to dispossess the serpent and bird of their home. Having accomplished this feat, Inana fashioned a diadem for her brother and a bed for herself out of the roots and trunk of the won- drous plant. The Sumerians normally recognized Inana as a goddess of the skies and a sister of the sun- god, Utu. Yet she frequently pays a visit to the underworld of her sister, Ereshkigal, in the aquatic domains of Uruk and Eridu (i.e., near Ur and Eden of Sumerian myths; Wolkstein and Kramer 1983:51-91). In this respect her physi- cal attributes and mythic activities seem to mir- ror the morphic and behavioral characteristics of her cherished plant; for Inana is intimately as- sociated with aquatic environments, a primeval tree of creation, the cyclic occurrence of vege- tative life, and ornaments of gold and lapis lazuli (i.e., the natural colors of the Egyptian lotus). She displays her adornments in the heavens and discards them from her body when she descends into the bowels of the Earth (presumably on an annual basis), much as a lotus blossom. Inana was occasionally identified as none other than Ishtar of Babylon and Assyria or as Ashtarte, Ashtoreth, Asherah or Anat of Canaan and Egypt, all of whom share close iconographic re- lations with the sacred lotus (Fig. 4 c, d; Budge 1969:278-280; Frankfort 1939:207, 278; Keel and Uehlinger 1998:54, 65, 66, 86, 87, 360; Pa- tai 1990:58-60, Fig. 12-16, 18). The huluppu plant of Inana is possibly the same immortalizing plant that eluded her famous heroic brother, Gilgamesh, whom in the mythi- cal guise of a mortal man sought a sweet-smell- ing, aquatic flowering plant (Pritchard 1969:73). Various versions of the Gilgamesh story are re- corded on tablets of the Akkadians, Sumerians, Hittites, Hurrians, and Assyrians, and all recount the manner in which a crafty serpent succeeds in reclaiming the plant of the gods from this he- roic figure before he is able to consume his prized possession (Pritchard 1969:96). As the serpent repossesses his rightful property, he slips out of his worn-out skin to reveal his immortal character to Gilgamesh, thereby signaling that humankind will be denied the gift of eternal life. It is widely acknowledged that this tale shares a common origin with the biblical account of Eden's proverbial tree of life, since both tales incorporate the mythical themes of a sacred tree, devious serpent, human aspirations to live in paradise, and the origin or perpetuation of hu- man mortality. And it is similarly hypothesized that these tales share close relations with the 'Myth of Etana', in which tale a heroic shepherd known as Etana is granted access to a 'tree of rebirth' (the sammu plant) by following the helpful advice of a sun-god (Shamash). In this case, the shepherd is able to elude a diabolical serpent at the root of the sacred tree by mount- ing the back of a divine eagle to reach the upper boughs of the plant (Black and Green 1992:78; Pritchard 1969:114-119). These and yet other related mythical tales probably relate to the iconographic practice of placing a winged solar orb, eagle, or leogryph above or beside the tree of life (Fig. la, c, d, e, 2c), and the custom of placing sacred serpents around the tree's solar orb (Fig. Ic, 5c) and pillared trunk (Danthine 1937, Fig. 152; Frankfort 1939:120-122). THE RETURN OF THE TREE OF LIFE Various mythic traditions of Europe and Asia maintain that the tree of life will reappear on Earth at some time in the distant future and be- stow eternal life upon living creation. Zoroastri- ans believe that the 'tree of all seeds' (homa) will spring from the waters of Lake Hamun of Iran during the Earth's final days of reckoning (Bundahisn xxvii.4, xxx.24-25; see West 1880, SBE 5:126; Boyce 1991:125), while Muslims</page><page sequence="16">128 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 56 await a similar plant in paradise on the last day of judgement, when it will take its predestined place at the right hand of Allah in the seventh level of heaven (Koran liii, lvi). Rabbinical lit- erature acknowledges that the tree of immortal life resides permanently in Yahweh's garden of paradise (Jalkut Shimeon, Genesis xx; James 1966:778), whereas Christians anticipate the re- appearance of the same plant in Jerusalem upon the return of Jesus Christ (Revelations ii, xxii). While these and related beliefs have long been dismissed as superstitious speculations by biol- ogists, there appears to be an underlying histor- ical significance to these mythic and prophetic scenarios. An objective consideration of the ar- cheological record suggests that the plant in question is the Egyptian lotus, and that human- kind has never lost contact with the famous 'plant of the gods'. What has apparently been lost over the ages is our understanding of the mythic significance of the plant, and the ritual- istic role it once played in the religious traditions of our distant forebears.
