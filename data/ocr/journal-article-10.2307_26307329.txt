THE POLITICS OF CLASSIC-PERIOD RITUAL INTERACTION Iconography of the ball game cult in coastal Oaxaca Judith Francis Zeitlin Center for Latin American Studies, Brown University, Providence, Rl 02912, USA Abstract The Classic period along the Oaxaca Coast was a time of population growth and increased sociopolitical complexity, as marked by the prominence of hierarchical settlement systems, large regional centers, and the proliferation of monumental artworks. An iconographic examination of standing stone sculpture from six archaeological sites between the Rio Verde and the Rio de los Perros indicates that these later Classic societies were concerned with the same religious themes that prevailed at that time throughout the Peripheral Coastal Lowlands: the Underworld death and rebirth of the celestial deities in mythical events reenacted in the ritual ballgame. With no single dominant power dictating cult orthodoxy, independent political leaders interpreted these rituals freely. As permanent public expressions of the polity's stature, the sculptures and the religious message they encoded appear to have both enhanced a leader's prestige in intergroup social competition and helped foster internal social differentiation. During the Classic period the southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec typified a trend observed all along the periphery of Monte Al bán's sphere of political and economic influence. From the eastern Oaxaca coast to the Cuicatlan Cañada, local settlement pattern disruption and divergent ceramic styles are evidence of Monte Albán's retrenchment to areas closer to its central Oaxaca valley base, probably in response to a perceived threat from Te otihuacan's growing empire (Blanton et al. 1979; Brockington 1974; Feinman 1985; Redmond 1983). Population expansion at Monte Albán itself and in the southern arm of the valley, where agricultural production intensified and regional administrative centers proliferated, supports architectural evidence that the Early Classic period was a time of vigorous internal growth within the boundaries of a more consolidated state. What significance did these developments hold for the outer fringe of Monte Albán's former allies and dependencies? Some areas like the Cuicatlan Cañada apparently were incorporated into the economic net of Monte Albán's competitor (Redmond 1983). But Teotihuacanos seem to have selected their economic and political connections in southeastern Mesoamerica with care, establishing trade relationships on the western Oaxaca coast, while skirting the arid lowlands of the southern Isthmus, where they left little mark on local ceramics (Joyce 1991, 1993; J. Zeitlin 1978a). On the nearby Chiapas coast and in the Cen tral Depression, their influence was strong at such sites as Mirador, Tonala, and Los Horcones (Agrinier 1975; Ferdon 1953; Navarrete 1973). Left out of this broad-brush picture of Classic-period polit ical rivalries are numerous other non-Maya contemporaries of Teotihuacan and Monte Albán, ignored in the expansionist plans of highland states and consigned as a consequence to the periphery of archaeological vision. For at least some of these peripheral Classic-period societies, the price of political indepen dence was neither internal economic and cultural stagnation nor external isolation. On the southern Isthmus, as a case in point, steady population expansion and new settlement growth accompanied a florescence of local arts and crafts traditions that included the region's first known monumental art. Isthmian ceramic and sculptural styles have strong affinities with those of many contemporary cultures located within the wide geo graphic belt that Lee Parsons (1969) distinguished as the Periph eral Coastal Lowlands (PCL), yet their unique blending of motifs and materials was a purely local expression. It appears that the extensive cultural and economic exchange relationships forged by Isthmus populations were common place among lowland chiefdoms and small-scale states during the Classic period. What I discern to be their underlying prin ciples of interpolity interaction may, in fact, be more typical of Mesoamerican cultural and political processes than momentous episodes of expansionists state making. For such marginal, out lying regions, however, the social choices implicit in artifact style are often obscured in published archaeological reports behind technical descriptions of local pottery types or neglected in the rare comparative synthesis. To illustrate my argument, I will reexamine what has been identified as one of the primary iconographic themes within PCL artistic traditions, that of the ritual ballgame cult. My attention was first drawn to this Classic-period phenomenon as I attempted to make sense out of a complex of stylistic repre sentations encountered in my own excavations in the vicinity of Juchitan, Oaxaca. Not just the southern Isthmus, I have found, but much of the Oaxaca Coast as far west as the Rio Verde, 121</page><page sequence="2">122 Zeitlin can be seen to have embraced the central ideas of this highly symbolic version of the Mesoamerican ballgame. Although the Oaxaca Coast data range greatly in quality (perhaps one reason the zone has been overlooked in most systematic formulations of the PCL cotradition; see Figure 1), I believe they point to important social and political features of the ballgame cult's spread during the Classic. Loosely defined by Renfrew's (1986) concept of "peer-polity interaction," these features involve prin ciples of political competition and symbolic emulation that ex tend our understanding of interregional interaction beyond more familiar models of economic utility. CLASSIC-PERIOD BALLGAME-CULT ICONOGRAPHY IN THE PERIPHERAL COASTAL LOWLANDS With the recent publication of scholarly papers proceeding from a 1985 international symposium on the Mesoamerican ballgame (Scarborough and Wilcox 1991), more than a brief summary of the history of the game would be redundant. Neither the ball game nor its sacrificial rituals were a Classic-period lowland innovation, as Leyenaar and Parsons's (1988:26-31) survey of archaeological antecedents demonstrates. Ballplayers are de picted in figurines and stone sculpture from highland Mexico and the Gulf Coast as early as 1200 B.C., and Terminal Forma tive (200 B.C.—a.d. 200) ballcourts are known for west Mexico, the Valley of Oaxaca, northern Chiapas, and northern Belize. Although formal courts are not as yet firmly documented for the PCL until the Classic period, Middle and Late Formative examples of stone yokes, hachas, and handstones have been found at several sites in Veracruz (Leyenaar and Parsons 1988:26-31). Figurines depicting similar paraphernalia on cos tumed ballplayers confirm the established association between these artifacts and the ballgame (Ekholm 1991:245), even in the absence of ballcourt architecture. Demonstrably of considerable antiquity in both highland and lowland Mesoamerica, the ballgame and its attendant sacrificial rituals assumed even greater symbolic significance during the Middle Classic when, according to Esther Pasztory (1972, 1978), it became the dominant ritual theme throughout the PCL. The principal rituals of the ballgame cult are illustrated even earlier in the Terminal Formative ballplayer sculpture of Izapa and contemporary sites in Guatemala (Leyenaar and Parsons 1988:29-30): decapitation scenes, trophy-head presentations, and the receipt of sacrifices by serpent-winged or diving gods. Many of these ballgame rituals survived their Classic-period flo rescence and continued to be represented widely in Postclassic art and myth, indeed persisting into the Colonial-period histor ical record. It is in these later representations of the ballgame, particularly in several central Mexican codices and in the Maya mythical nar rative, the Popol Vuh, that the game's broad cosmological sig nificance has been interpreted as a contest between the celestial and underworld gods. The decapitation of the losing Sun god and, in some versions, either his twin Venus or his consort the Figure 1. Classic-period Mesoamerica and the Peripheral Coastal Lowlands as demarcated by Parsons (1978).</page><page sequence="3">Politics of Classic-period ritual interaction 123 Moon ultimately leads to their rebirth and the rejuvenation of agricultural fertility as the gods reemerge from the underworld (Cohodas 1975; Knauth 1961; Krickeberg 1966; Pasztory 1972; Thompson 1970). While there are several historically known variations of the underworld ballgame myth, the variants themselves appear to have great longevity. Specific events faced by particular protag onists can often be recognized across broad spans of time and in different media. Mythic scenes recounted in the Popol Vuh, for example, have been identified on funerary vessels painted almost a thousand years earlier by Classic Maya artisans (Coe 1973, 1978; Tedlock 1985:91, 106, 154-155). Although the post Conquest body of Mesoamerican myth does not embrace all the stories depicted in pre-Columbian religious art, these continu ities underscore the centrality of the underworld ballgame theme to Mesoamerican cosmology, particularly in the lowlands. They help validate the search for iconographic correspondences re lated to ballgame myth and ritual among temporally distinct cultural traditions. Despite the ballgame's lengthy history and frequent secular associations, Pasztory (1972) has argued that it is only among Middle Classic sites (a.d. 400-700) of the PCL and Maya areas that the ritual game acquired the status of a major cult. As such, the cult was served by an officially promulgated body of ritu als and religious tenets closely identified with the polity and its leadership, a status it had lost by the Postclassic. Although she acknowledges the wide distribution of ballplayer figurines and isolated references to the game outside this area, Pasztory (1972:442) restricts the presence of major cults to those sites with publicly displayed monumental art, where ballgame icon ographic themes embody the "emblems" of officially sanctioned religious concerns embraced by the community as a whole. Her distinction between minor and major ballgame cults, in this study applied to a more expansive set of later Classic PCL sites, including the Oaxaca Coast,1 properly turns our attention to the political and social factors underlying the promotion of this particular cult by so many local leaders. Before turning to con sider the nature of the ballgame cult's political sponsorship, however, let us first examine what appears to have been its ritual and ideological content. Probably the most comprehensive graphic representation of the game's ceremonialism within the PCL is found in the six carved panels of the Late Classic "South Ball Court" at El Tajin, with their unified sequence of narrative scenes depicting pre game preparations, ballplayer sacrifice, and the victim's rebirth in the supernatural realm. Although they clearly link ritual ball game human sacrifice to cosmological events, interpretations of the events portrayed in the South Ball Court scenes have var ied somewhat. Cohodas (1975), for example, views the scenes in broad terms, finding the dominant general theme of agricul tural fertility expressed in two parallel narratives of the death and rebirth of the Sun god, each with its own set of seasonally reenacted ceremonies. In his recent, detailed iconographic reading, Wilkerson (1991:67) sees a more specific cult variant of the mythical un derworld journey theme taking place at the South Ball Court. In this interpretation the gods controlling the production of pul que are propitiated during sacrificial ceremonies coinciding with the nine-day disappearance of Venus, whose imagery figures throughout the sculptures. At El Tajin, Wilkerson argues, the 11 or more ballcourts constructed between the Early Classic and Epiclassic periods may each have been dedicated to sepa rate religious subcults. Because it was so widely recognized among contemporary Gulf Coast cultures, the sacrificial ball game and its ideological theme of supernatural death and rebirth could serve as the central rite unifying religious practice. Turning to the Pacific side of the PCL, we see that formal ballcourts of the conventional Mesoamerican /-shaped floor plan, such as those found at El Tajin, are not a necessary com ponent of the Classic-period sacrificial ballgame cult at the major Cotzumalhuapa sites in the Escuintla district of Guatemala. J. Eric Thompson (1948) located a Late Classic enclosed, sunken ballcourt at El Baúl, but Parsons found no formal court at the neighboring and at least partially contemporary site of Bilbao during his investigations there in 1962-1963. At Bilbao, how ever, excavations at the broad, terraced area Parsons has called the Monument Plaza showed this zone to be the probable source of many of the 31 major carved stone monuments taken from the site to the Berlin Museum in the late nineteenth century (Par sons 1969:44). Paramount among these are eight low-relief ballplayer ste lae that depict fully costumed human players engaged in the decapitation and dismemberment of a sacrificial victim (Mon ument 1) or the offering of some supplication to a celestial de ity, represented as a "diving god" (Monuments 2-6, 8, and probably the incomplete Monument 7). This group of stelae, carved in what Parsons distinguishes as the earlier, "narrative" style, provides the most comprehensive depiction of the Cot zumalhuapa thematic concerns, but the eclectic sculptural style is not limited to Bilbao and its neighbor, El Baúl. It is wide spread at Classic-period sites along the Guatemalan coast, from the Chiapas border at Abaj Takalik to Cara Sucia, El Salvador, with some highland penetration in the Antigua Basin and at Kaminaljuyu (Parsons 1978:30). Dominating the corpus of known works are themes and mo tifs drawn from the ritual ballgame cult: ballplayers attired with protective yokes, gloves, and sandals; depictions of human sac rifice through decapitation, limb removal, and heart extraction; stylized death's heads and skeletonized manikins; composite monster deities combining different animal and/or anthropo morphic attributes; cross-armed human figures; celestial diving gods; sun vultures; human heads in serpent jaws; flowering vines and anthropomorphic cacao pods (Parsons 1969:143). The Cotzumalhuapa artists used luxuriant plant imagery to convey the underlying fertility associations symbolized by the frequent images of human sacrifice and death. As at El Tajin, the association is unequivocal in the Cotzumalhuapa image of 'Not all the sites, buildings, or monuments considered here fall with certainty within the a.d. 400 to 700 span of the Middle Classic. Few of the Oaxaca Coast materials come from excavated contexts, and many that do are more comfortably assigned to the Late Classic. Even the dat ing of such central edifices in the lowland ballgame cult as the Tajin South Ball Court is questionable. Based upon their subsurface sampling results, Krotser and Krotser (1973) considered El Tajin to have been pri marily built during the Late Classic (a.d. 600-900). Recent excavations directed by Kohler and Brüggemann, however, emphasize a Terminal Classic-Early Postclassic site occupation and date all the Tajin ballcourts to a.d. 800-1200 (Raesfeld 1990). In this discussion 1 have followed Wilkerson (1991:50) in assuming a protracted Early to Epiclassic period of ballcourt construction at El Tajin and a Late Classic date for the South Ball Court. Hatch (1989:34), based on further studies at Bilbao and El Baúl, is emphatic that the Cotzumalhuapa ballgame sculptures are of Late Classic date as well.</page><page sequence="4">124 Zeitlin a tree of life rising from a death figure (Parsons 1978:33). Clearly the ballgame rituals of human sacrifice commemorated in the Bilbao sculptures were meant to reenact the fertility-restoring sacrifice made by the gods in their journey to the underworld. Which deities or supernatural forces served as the protago nists in the Cotzumalhuapa version of these ancient myths is suggested by the iconography of the diving-god images on the Bilbao monuments themselves. References to Sun, Venus, and Moon are among the more obvious diving-god associations, but Parsons (1969:141) finds among the entire corpus of Cotzumal huapan sculptures several Central Mexican-influenced deity rep resentations, including Xipe Totee, Tlaloc, Quetzalcoatl as both Feathered Serpent and the Wind god Ehecatl, and Huehueteotl, the Old Fire god. Following Wilkerson's view of the Tajin ball game cults, we may be seeing in the Cotzumalhuapa sculpture not one, but multiple versions of the underworld death and re birth theme, each with its own set of mythological heroes and divine agents, but identified as a group through the common alities of the ballgame ritual. To explain the appearance and distribution of the ballgame cult in the Cotzumalhuapa region and neighboring Guatemalan highlands, Parsons (1986:99, 1991) advocates Borhegyi's (1965) idea that it was spread through the agency of Teotihuacan mer chant-colonists. References to Teotihuacan are common on the Pacific Coast, frequently expressed in sculpture and architecture as geometric depictions of central Mexican deities, horizontally tenoned heads, and talud-tablero-style platforms. Cylindrical tripod vases, composite incense burners, and other styles from the Teotihuacan ceramic complex occur as well. While the strength of these foreign influences is greatest at sites like Los Horcones in Chiapas and the well-known highland Guatemalan site of Kaminaljuyu, Parsons distinguishes a brief but critical phase of direct Teotihuacan influence at Bilbao itself (but see Hatch 1989:34).2 During the first half of the early Laguneta phase, between a.d. 400-550, he suggests that much of the Chiapas and Guatemalan coastal region was influenced by Te otihuacan entrepreneurs. Despite the strong temporal correlation between Teotihua can influence and the rise of the ballgame cult in the Chiapas Guatemalan coastal regions, there seems little basis for the thesis that Teotihuacanos were responsible for bringing the ritual ball game to the Pacific Coast. Berlo's (1984) analysis of artifactual data associated specifically with the Teotihuacan colonists sug gests a vigorously maintained, ethnically distinct ceremonialism for this group centered around the central Mexican warrior cult. The colonists' collective ritual orthodoxy is at odds with their proposed role as proponents of ballgame cult practices so deeply rooted in lowland traditions. At Teotihuacan itself the unique Tepantitla compound murals and related La Ventilla ballgame marker, like the occasional finds of ballplayer figurines and Veracruz-style yokes and hachas made elsewhere at the site, reflect a reinterpreted version of the lowland ritual game, one which never acquired the status of more than a minor cult (Pasz tory 1972: 446-449) Neither ballcourt architecture nor the low land cult's highly developed iconographic associations of ritual human sacrifice have been found at Teotihuacan. The fact that Teotihuacan-influenced Middle Classic sites are found throughout the PCL and that many of them, from Matacapan and Matacanela on the Gulf Coast, to Los Horcones, Palo Gordo, and Nueva Linda on the Pacific Coast, and Kam inaljuyu in the adjoining highlands, have ballcourts need not im ply that Teotihuacanos promoted the ritual ballgame's spread. Indeed, given the abundant Formative representations of dif ferent elements of the sacrificial ballgame throughout the PCL and the precedent of the Izapa narrative style of stone sculpture on the Pacific Coast, it seems much more likely that the Teoti huacanos merely contributed the prestige of their architectural and sculptural aesthetic to an independently evolving PCL rit ual preoccupation. The ballgame cult was an ideological concern that both out lasted the relatively brief presence of these foreign colonies and, as we shall see in the section below, required no Teotihuacan merchant-warriors to spread its message among coastal popu lations to the west. Should we look instead for an alternative lowland innovation center responsible for the cult's promul gation, perhaps through the kind of direct economic and/or political intercession often associated with the highland city's influence? A case for the heavy hand of long-distance Teotihua can authority might be demonstrated archaeologically by the reproduction of formal architectural and artistic canons or by the presence of artifactually distinctive ethnic enclaves. In con trast, major PCL sites have more limited geographic spheres of influence, a point I will return to when considering the cultural affinities evident at Oaxaca Coast sites. Individual sculptures or trade vessels may point to contact between different lowland cultural zones, if not between specific sites, but the most salient characteristic of the Classic-period PCL is the very eclecticism with which common themes and motifs are represented. With no single center likely to have been the inspiration for (or the proselytizing force behind) the spread of the ritual ball game cult, I find that a more appropriate focus is on the pro cess of local cult acceptance and imitation. Religious observance that was practiced in public buildings and symbolized in cen trally displayed works of art of necessity required official sanc tion by those wielding political power at the local level. The model for the political sponsorship of Classic-period ballgame ritual that will be proposed here is one that takes into consid eration the cult's pragmatic attraction for the countless local leaders who embraced it. But before offering some further spec ulations on the social, economic, and political mechanisms be hind the florescence of the ballgame cult in the PCL, I will review the archaeological and iconographic evidence for the expansion of the ritual ballgame among less well-known Clas sic-period societies of the Oaxaca Coast. I begin with the south ern Isthmus, where several different lines of evidence point to strong cultural and economic ties with the Gulf Coast lowlands and to participation in the ballgame cult. THE CLASSIC PERIOD ON THE SOUTHERN ISTHMUS Classic-period pottery from the southern Isthmus has been discussed in published reports by Forster (1955) and Delgado (1961, 1965), but Wallrath (1967) was the first to present a preliminary ceramic chronology for the region, based on his limited excavations in the Tehuantepec region. Excavations con ducted in 1972 by Robert Zeitlin and myself in the vicinity of Juchitan filled in some major gaps in Wallrath's chronological 2Although recent ceramic analysis and field studies refute Parsons's claim for a Teotihuacan horizon at the Cotzumalhuapa centers, my in tent in examining his argument in detail is to dispel the notion that ball game rituals were carried to the Pacific Coast by Teotihuacanos.</page><page sequence="5">Politics of Classic-period ritual interaction 125 sequence and added substantially to the corpus of pottery used to define each phase (J. Zeitlin 1978a; R. Zeitlin 1979; Zeitlin and Zeitlin 1990). In addition, our intensive survey of the flood plain of the Río de los Perros served as a basis for analyzing population dynamics, resource-zone exploitation patterns, and the growth of settlement hierarchies over time (J. Zeitlin 1978b). The Xuku phase (ca. a.d. 300-600) marks the onset of the Classic period in the southern Isthmus. One of its most strik ing features in the Río de los Perros zone is the abandonment of Laguna Zope, the preeminent site of the region throughout the Formative period, in favor of a nearby location closer to the present river course. Whether or not Laguna Zope's demise can be linked directly to the contraction of the Monte Albán state, the local population seems not to have been adversely affected by external political events. The new site, Saltillo, attracted a comparably large number of inhabitants as witnessed by the many low house mounds and surface scatters of Xuku-phase sherds distributed over an area of some 68 ha, an area only slightly less than that attributed to the final phase of Laguna Zope's occupation. Moreover, the region as a whole seems to have witnessed a marked population growth, with 10 new sites besides Saltillo established in our survey area alone, and a similar increase noted for the Xuku phase in less intensively surveyed sections of the coastal plain. These rural settlements included all kinds of com munities, from larger nucleated villages to small hamlets and homesteads. Population continued to increase into the Late Classic Tixum phase (ca. a.d. 600-900), at which time the Rio de los Perros floodplain added four more small settlements and the occupied area at the Saltillo site doubled to approximately 150 ha. Classic-period pottery on the southern Isthmus shows both initial continuities with local Formative wares and the evolution of a distinctive fine-paste kaolin-ware tradition that continued into the Early Postclassic. A variety of composite vessel forms and decorative modes that often combined prefired red painted lines with incised or gouged bands characterizes this ware in the Xuku phase (Figure 2b-d). Gradually the forms were standard ized into simpler flat-bottomed hemispherical or outslanting wall bowls, the latter usually supported by bulbous hollow feet. Resist painting became the dominant decorative mode in late Xuku times (Figure 2a), and it was frequently combined with painted decoration that by the Tixum phase was usually applied after the vessel had been fired. As the technique of resist paint ing was perfected, favored designs shifted from simpler, pre dominantly zoomorphic motifs, often just faintly traced on the vessel exterior, to well-shaded complex geometric and zoomor phic designs executed on both vessel surfaces (Figure 3c-d). In the Tixum phase the single most important motif was that of a stylized feathered serpent. Although Isthmian pottery generally shows few parallels with contemporary Valley of Oaxaca wares, private collections occasionally include an obvious Monte Albán diagnostic, such as the Classic-period Oaxaca-style urns illustrated by Wallrath (1967: Figure 73a-c). During the course of a recent archaeolog ical project investigating Postclassic and Colonial-period devel opments on the southern Isthmus, for example, I was shown part of an artifact collection a homeowner had made during some construction near the Saltillo site center. Two perfect Monte Albán Illb funerary urns had been recovered from a slab-lined tomb, itself indicating completely different mortuary 7® 7I&amp; Figure 2.

This foreigner and his family may have been members of a small Zapotee enclave per manently attached to the Saltillo site in a modest provincial version of the Oaxaca barrio at Teotihuacan. No similar mate rials were collected during the course of our 1972 test excava tions and intensive survey at Saltillo. To find parallels with the dominant local pottery of the Xuku and Tixum phases, however, we must look not to the highlands but north, across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Fine paste wares, especially white-slipped and kaolin types decorated with resist painting, are also found on the Gulf Coast during the Classic, where they may be the primary pottery at sites from central Ver acruz to Campeche (Du Solier 1945; García Payón 1971; Krotser and Krotser 1973; Medellin Zenil 1960; Ruz Lhuillier 1969; Stark 1989). Tuxtlas polychrome sherds and other occasional pieces of Gulf Coast trade ware excavated at Saltillo further strengthen the supposition that this area was the most likely source of aesthetic inspiration or mutual encouragement for the Classic-period south-Isthmian potters. Surely the most spectac ular of imports, however, is a Late Classic Maya cylindrical</page><page sequence="6">126 Zeitlin Figure 3. Late Classic (Tixum phase) pottery and figurine types from the southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec: (a-b) Ixtal Undecorated; (c-d) Ixtal Re sist; (e) San Vicente Burnished; (f) Tlacotepec Triple-banded; (g-h) realis tic Jaina-style figurines; (i) slab-type moldmade figurine; (j) thin stone hacha. polychrome vase, much cherished by its Isthmian owner, if we may judge from the care with which it had been laced together again after breaking (Figure 4). Obsidian provides yet another line of evidence for cultural and economic ties to the Gulf Coast during the Classic period. In his trace-element analysis of south-Isthmian obsidian arti facts, Robert Zeitlin (1982) noted an abrupt shift in source use during the Xuku phase to Zaragoza, Puebla, and Altotonga, Veracruz, both of which are close to El Tajin and may have been controlled by Veracruz merchants. Conspicuously absent from our Classic-period sample are two sources thought to have been monopolized by Teotihuacan directly or through its surro gates—Pachuca, Hidalgo and El Chayal, Guatemala. It is in the mixed category of nonutilitarian artifacts and sculpture, especially those related to the ceremonial ballgame, that the ideological weight of this strong Gulf Coast-western Maya connection becomes clear. For example, tripod-supported naturalistic figurines with elaborate hair styles, reminiscent of the more famous Late Classic figurine tradition from the island of Jaina, were popular during the Tixum phase (Figure 3g-h). Given the weak Teotihuacan influence on south-Isthmian pot tery generally, even the dissimilar but equally popular "Teoti huacanoid" figurine style (Figure 3i) may have developed through contact with a Gulf Coast intermediary like Matacapan (George Cowgill, personal communication 1992). No complete examples of Jaina-style figurines were found in our excavations, but they are a frequent object of local pothunting. Paddock (1978:Figure 3a-b) illustrates two particularly intriguing ball player figurines of this type from the Isthmus that found their way into the Frissell Museum collections, one wearing a trophy head attached to a wide belt or possible yoke and the other con templating a decapitated head, the sacrificial knife still in his raised hand. To further document known Tehuantepec-area ballgame cult objects, we add to the trait inventory both miniature and full sized hachas similar to those associated with the Classic Ver acruz version of the game. A miniature carved stone hacha (Figure 3j) was excavated at Saltillo from a Tixum-phase con text that corroborates the suggested Late Classic date of two full-sized Isthmian thin stone anthropomorphic heads illustrated by Wallrath (1967:Figure 83) and Paddock (1978:Figure 5). Although no formal ballcourt was found at Saltillo, one ex traordinary mortuary feature from our excavations there can be linked to the kind of ceremonial decapitation elsewhere depicted in ritual ballgame iconography. It is a unique urn burial of 10 adult male skulls, medially cut and treated with red ochre. An elaborate offering of 26 late Xuku-early Tixum vessels accom panied the 90-cm-deep funerary vessel, which itself rested on the crushed skull of a young child. At the core of the Saltillo site is a partly destroyed earthen mound about 2 m high which, according to Juchitan infor mants, was the source of the carved stone stela now on display at the Museo Nacional de Antropología (Figure 5). We have no other examples of standing stone sculpture from the southern Isthmus, but the rather stiffly modeled, full-round, anthropo morphic figure, with eyes closed and arms crossed at his chest, has his Late Classic counterpart in neighboring lowland zones. Less frequently associated with Gulf Coast ballgame iconogra phy (although a related low-relief sculpture of a crossed-arm figure was found at Tuzapan, Veracruz; see Parsons 1986:Fig ure 189), both low-relief and in-the-round, crossed-arm figures are widely distributed along the Pacific Coast. As will be dis cussed in more detail below, they are especially prominent at sites located in western Oaxaca and adjoining Guerrero (Jorrin 1974; Joyce and Winter 1989; Piña Chan 1960). More recently crossed-arm sculptures have been noted in some highland Oaxaca localities as well. Feinman (1985:Fig ure 4) illustrates an incomplete low-relief sculpture moved to a housewall in the southern Valley of Oaxaca town of Ejutla. Bernal and Oliveros (1988:Photo 38) recovered a crossed-arm sculpture of uncertain age from a secondary context at Dainzu, a long-occupied Valley of Oaxaca site well known for its ball player iconography and its ballcourt, which is now dated to the Late Classic Monte Albán IV period. Winter (1991) found an other damaged in-the-round sculpture of this type at the Ñuiñe site of Cerro de las Minas, near the Mixteca Baja town of Hu ajuapan de León. The Cerro de las Minas sculpture has partic ular relevance to this discussion, for it was found during the course of excavations at the site's Classic-period ballcourt. In coastal Guatemala the symbolic importance of the crossed-arm figure is underscored by its cartouche-enclosed representation among the small corpus of Cotzumalhuapa-tradition glyphs</page><page sequence="7">Politics of Classic-period ritual interaction 127 Figure 4. Fragments of Maya polychrome vase from the Saltillo site, Tixum phase. (Parsons 1969; Thompson 1948). One probable reading of the figure's meaning as an image of death or passage into the un derworld associated specifically with the ballgame cult can be seen in the iconography of Monument 26 from El Baúl (Parsons 1969:Plate 52d). In that low-relief sculpture, a three-dimensional set of six identical, crossed-arm figures physically supports the ground surface on which one ballplayer claims victory over another. The elaborately costumed Juchitan sculpture suggests a more specific referent, however, than that conveyed at EI Baúl. While little attention was given to the lower body, with its simple wrapped skirt and waistband, the artist emphasized the protrud ing rib bones of the torso, producing a figure whose gaunt ap pearance is further exaggerated by the thinness of the sculpture itself. Although Mesoamerican artistic conventions commonly depicted aged individuals in such an emaciated fashion, I think it unlikely, given the Classic-period context of the monument and the numerous other references at Saltillo to ballgame rit ual, that the sculpture was intended simply to honor the mem ory of a departed, elderly chief. Looking more closely at the treatment of the figure's head, we see iconographic elements similar to those used by the Clas sic Maya to depict the supernatural Scroll Jaguar. Scrolls em anate from the corners of the mouth, the head is capped by a bifurcated scroll, and the small, jaguarlike ears are positioned at forehead height. As Freidel (1986:101-106) points out, among the Maya these attributes distinguish the jaguar as a supernat ural representation of the Sun during his nighttime journey to the underworld. Archaeologically and iconographically, the Scroll Jaguar was associated by the Maya with ballcourts, sac rifice, and decapitation. These associations must have been fa miliar to the Saltillo artist as well, who used the additional symbolism of crossed-arms and emaciated physique to represent the Sun god's underworld death, which, as we have seen, is the central mythical event in the ballgame cult. EVIDENCE FOR THE RITUAL BALLGAME CULT ON THE OAXACA COAST Although no Classic-period ballcourt has yet been found on the southern Isthmus, the Juchitan sculpture, with its demonstrated iconographic associations, is itself an important piece of evi dence establishing the ritual ballgame as a major cult at the Saltillo site. Physical remains of decapitation rites and figurine representations of ballplayers, some with trophy heads or other conventions of human sacrifice, further support this conclusion. Looking further west along the Oaxaca Coast, we find a pro liferation of Classic-period sites with comparable referents to the PCL ritual ballgame, manifested specifically in stone mon uments and portable stone sculptures (Figure 6).</page><page sequence="8">128 Zeitlin Figure 5. (a-b) Two views of the three-dimensional sculp ture from the Saltillo site, Juchitan, Museo Nacional de Antropología. Unfortunately, this large area has had little systematic ar chaeological investigation. Early reconnaissances by DeCicco and Brockington (1956) and a slightly later study by Piña Chan (1960) were followed by a long-term survey project initiated by Brockington in the 1960s, with limited test excavation at a small number of the 124 sites he and his field crew discovered between the Isthmus and the Guerrero border (Brockington 1966; Brock ington and Long 1974; Brockington et al., 1974). Salvage op erations have been conducted by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia personnel in the developing tourist zone around Huatulco, but the sites tested thus far are of Postclas sic date (Fernández Dávila and Gómez Serafín 1990:494-495). More recently the lower Rio Verde has become the focus of two collaborative archaeological projects conducted during the late 1980s under the direction of Grove, Gillespie, Arana, Win ter, and Joyce (see Joyce and Winter [1989] for a published summary). Neither project had as its primary objective an elu cidation of Classic-period developments, but excavations by Joyce and Winter at the site of Río Viejo have given more con textual information about the type of society that produced the previously reported stone sculptures. These results, in concert with Brockington's extensive survey of sites more provisionally assigned to prehistoric phases, are discussed here in light of their possible association with the later Classic ritual ballgame. Unlike the southern Isthmus, the western Oaxaca Coast has several later Classic sites with ballcourts; they include La Humedad in the Rio Verde Valley, Manialtepec south of No pala, and two sites in the Astatla-Huamelula area, Los Cocos and Hualampano.

Major Classic-period archaeological sites of the Oaxaca Coast. period sacrificial cult, many such sites have additional carved stonework linked to the PCL ritual ballgame. Fragments of stone yokes and a carved hacha have been found at Los Cocos and Hualampano, as well as at a third site in the Astatla area, Hualakgoce, which lacks a formal ballcourt (Brockington 1974). Stelae from these and other localities east of Pochutla seem to be without carving, but a ballcourt at Manialtepec has two carved stones of human figures facing one another across the center of the playing area. Both of these figures are partly bur ied (and unexcavated), so there is too little information about their appearance to relate them specifically to ritual ballgame iconography. A third carved stela at the site, found 8-10 m north of the ballcourt, is described as having a low-relief depic tion of a crossed-arm figure (Jorrin 1974:46). Although the existence of later Classic ballcourts and ball game equipment is a good indication that ballgame rituals were practiced on the Oaxaca Coast, the presence of the ritual game and its status as a major cult can also be supported by icono graphic representations in several complexes of monumental art. More than 50 carved-stone sculptures have been reported for the Oaxaca Coast and adjoining areas of eastern Guerrero, where either archaeological context or stylistic affinity indicates a pre dominantly Classic-period time span for this spurt of monument carving. The present discussion will focus on sculpture from five sites —Río Viejo, the two sites at Rio Grande, Cerro del Rey, and Nopala. Four were initially selected for analysis because of the presence of crossed-arm representations reminiscent of the</page><page sequence="10">130 Zeitlin Saltillo sculpture, but the group as a whole displays an unan ticipated degree of concern with ballgame ritual themes. To gether the five localities have yielded the majority of carved monuments from the Oaxaca Coast, with 32 reported sculp tures. Within the group, they include the known sites or, in the case of Nopala, suspected original sites, with the largest num ber of carved monuments. The prominence of ballgame ritual concerns in this sample then further establishes the centrality of the Classic-period cult on the Oaxaca Coast. At the same time, the stylistic heterogeneity among sites can be used to illuminate political aspects of the cult's spread. We will begin with the westernmost of the sites, Río Viejo, where survey and stratigraphic excavations by Winter and Joyce in 1986 and 1988 led to the discovery in situ of many of the site's 10 Classic-period carved stones. Seven of these are low-relief stelae originally positioned, it appears, on the large central plat form constructed during the Classic or on one of its associated building structures, although there was some Postclassic reuti lization of the earlier carved stones in later building construc tion (Joyce 1991; Winter 1986). All the low-relief carvings except the curiously sparse and perhaps unfinished Monument 1 por tray fully costumed personages, generally shown in twisted three-quarters or "Egyptian" position, with head and feet pointed to the left and the torso viewed frontally. Just three of the carvings have published illustrations (Monuments 2, 5, and 8; Joyce and Winter 1989:Figure 4). My discussion here is based on unpublished photos and reports of the entire corpus kindly lent me by the excavators. Complex iconographic imagery depicted in the Rio Viejo low-relief stelae suggests that they represent specific deities or deity impersonators. Although the condition of the carved fig ures is often too eroded to offer a particular identification, several are candidates for deities associated elsewhere in the lowlands with the underworld death and rebirth mythology. In the Popo I Vuh, the twin deities who represent Sun and Venus begin their heroic adventures by avenging affronts to Hurricane or Heart of Sky, who functions as a proxy of Quetzalcoatl. The anthropomorphic figure of Río Viejo Monument 2 wears a buc cal mask and tall, possibly conical headdress, features typically associated in central Mexico with Quetzalcoatl in his guise as the Wind god (e.g., Nuttall 1903:49). The plumed headdress, mouth ornament, cape, baton, and snake-scepter of the Monument 5 figure resemble costume attributes of the Rain god (Figure 7), particularly as he is depicted on the north-central panel of the South Ball Court at El Tajin (see Wilkerson 1991:65). Acceptance of these two admittedly tentative identifications does not alone confirm the presence of the ritual ballgame at Río Viejo, of course, since there are alternative religious cults in which either god might have played a prominent role. A more specific ballgame-cult reference is implied by the underworld death posture of the crossed-arm figures on Monuments 8-10. Of these only Monument 8 (Figure 8) has sufficiently well preserved iconographic detail to amplify the theme, but here the ballplayer motif is strong. The figure is attired like a lowland ballplayer, with a thick protective pad worn on one knee; around his waist is a belt or yoke with interlocking scroll designs on its surface and a knifelike appendage on one side. Both the jaguar image in his elaborate headdress and the prominent spot on the figure's cheek support his identification as the under world Sun god (Thompson 1970:236). He is represented in the Popol Vuh by Xbalanque, one of the divine hero twins, who, '«• UH 'V ;' Figure 7. Río Viejo Monument 5 (courtesy Arthur Joyce). like their father and uncle before them, are challenged to a ball game by the underworld deities, a game in which the loser's actual or feigned decapitation figures prominently. Less than 50 km southeast of Río Viejo is another major Classic-period site designated Rio Grande #2 by the Oaxaca Coast Project. Eleven stone monuments were recorded there by the survey team, six of them carved, only one in the round. The five known low-relief stelae were originally placed in the north east corner of a large, low mound (Jorrin 1974:40). Each por trays a single anthropomorphic figure (that of Monument 4 has an animal companion as well) rendered in a more fluid carving style than that used at Rio Viejo. Only the four stelae for which Jorrin supplies line drawings will be discussed here (Figure 9); that of Monument 5 has been modified to approximate more closely facial details seen in the published photograph. All the figures have a large day glyph inscribed on the chest, which Jorrin (1974) identifies as Caso's Glyph E from Monte Albán, connoting "turquoise" or "precious stone," but also associated ideographically with the sun (Caso 1965b:Figures 8-9; Marcus 1983c: 192). The Rio Grande glyph can also be seen to resemble a Classic-period variant of Monte Albán Glyph L, which Caso (1928:39) related to the central Mexican ollin sym bol. A common glyph throughout the PCL in mid-to-late Clas sic times (see Parsons 1978), ollin or "movement, earthquake" is associated with the sun descending into the underworld (Pasz tory 1976:179-180). At El Tajin it is so commonly featured</page><page sequence="11">Politics of Classic-period ritual interaction 131 Figure 8. Río Viejo Monument 8 (courtesy Arthur Joyce). within a stylized incense bag cartouche that Wilkerson (1991:59) considers it a candidate for the site's emblem glyph. Elaborate headdress and facial imagery indicate that several gods or impersonated supernaturals are represented on the Rio Grande stelae, including the Rain god (Monument 4), the rep tilian Earth Monster (whose image is suggested by the elongated and snoutlike shape, bumpy surface and attenuated arms of Monument 3), Venus (seen in the headdress symbols of the more human figure of Monument 6), and the supernatural jaguar rep resentation of the Underworld Sun (Monument 5).3 Whether read as "sun" or "earthquake," the glyph worn by all the gods supports their representation in an underworld death and fer tility context. The complex imagery of Monument 5, however, draws our attention even more directly to the ritual ballgame and its cult of human sacrifice. The monkey companion depicted on this monument is a common image in Cotzumalhuapa sculpture and is widely rep resented in Mesoamerican art as a symbol of the night (Pasz tory 1976:188). Here at Rio Grande the monkey accompanies a supernatural jaguar who holds a decapitated head in one hand, while wearing another trophy head attached to his belt. Continuing the theme of human sacrifice, the more human appearing figure of Monument 6 brandishes a knife in one hand and sacrificial victim in his other. Although the Río Viejo and Rio Grande #2 low-relief sculp tures share some important formal attributes (e.g., their man ner of posing central figures and their common use of deep background excision to ground the carved images), composi tional differences are strong between the two groups and could reflect more than just the idiosyncrasies of their respective sculp tors. Joyce (1991) places Monument 8 from Rio Viejo in the Late Classic Yuta Tiyoo phase (approximately a.d. 550-900) on the basis of its in situ context. Stylistic similarity with the other low-relief Rio Viejo sculptures argues for their Late Classic date as well. The ceramic associations for the Rio Grande #2 monuments are more ambiguous. Jorrin (1974:73) reasons from the depic tion of the Monte Albán-style glyph that the sculptures were carved prior to that site's demise around a.d. 600. The Rio Grande sculptor's use of broad excised areas to both distinguish background and demarcate elements within figures is not typi cal of the Classic-period monuments of Monte Albán (Stela 6 from Monte Albán is an exception), although it is similar to Postclassic lápida sculptures from the Zapotec-speaking Valley of Oaxaca (cf. Caso 1928). Stylistic ties with Monte Albán do not help pinpoint the execution of the Rio Grande carvings. The monkey-jaguar supernatural stela resembles so greatly both the thematic content and the fluid composition of Es cuintla mold-made tripod vessels as to suggest the latter may even have been a prototype for the Rio Grande #2 sculptures. Looking at the question from a Guatemalan perspective, Hellmuth (1978:84) has noted the possible role of Rio Grande art among that of other regions in inspiring particular Escuintla motifs. Contact with the better-dated Guatemalan culture, if it could be supported more fully with artifact collections from the Oaxaca site, would place the Rio Grande stelae in the Middle Classic (a.d. 400-550), slightly before the probable carving of the Río Viejo low reliefs. Even a contemporaneous date is not out of the question for the Rio Viejo and Rio Grande #2 styles. Classic-period Rio Viejo was an immense, densely settled site over 3 km2 in area that dominated the lower Rio Grande Valley from the apex of a three-level settlement hierarchy, including the ballcourt site of La Humedad (Joyce 1991:434). It may be, however, that the political reach of any one center on the Oaxaca Coast, no mat ter how impressive, did not extend much beyond its own river valley. With neither a unified political organization linking neighboring river systems nor a long sculptural tradition to draw from, individual sculptors might well have derived aesthetic inspiration from diverse sources to render politically sponsored art works. Much stronger stylistic ties are evidenced among the frontally posed low-relief sculptures of the remaining three sites, and they will be considered here as a group, although archaeological con text is well established for just one of them. The site of Cerro del Rey, located upriver from Rio Grande #2, is a small moun tainous civic-ceremonial center with several mound and plaza groups. Pottery collected at the site is attributed to the Classic and Postclassic periods (Jorrin 1974:43). One low-relief carved stela and two crossed-arm, partially three-dimensional sculp tures are known from the site. The single carved Rio Grande #1 stela has been moved to the Museo Nacional de Antropología 3 These interpretations of the Rio Grande #2 iconography differ in many respects from those offered by Jorrin (1974) in her inventory of Oaxaca Coast sculpture.</page><page sequence="12">132 Zeitlin b tea r./jjjj, is K'S-':mI ^BM^rsjs^wem *lfc^ LbS^?°s' ■ -airf - El^iTXl '^•g^ .I1* »i.--w"J V .

Although Jorrin reports that there is a low archaeological mound nearby, it is unclear if that is the monument's original provenience. Three other plain stelae on this mound have been moved around, and there is intrusive fill material brought from another site to create the airstrip. Twenty-five kilometers east of the Rio Grande floodplain, the village of Nopala hosts the largest set of carved stelae discussed here, a group of 14 low-relief mon uments relocated in recent years from a nearby site to a wall around the municipal building. Two of the frontally posed sculptures in this analysis, Cerro del Rey Stela 1 (Figure 10a) and the Rio Grande #1 monument (Figure 11), are linked by more than just the formal attributes of composition: both share a common theme of human-jaguar transmutation. The Cerro del Rey monument, with its split im age of a human on the left joined to its jaguar alter ego on the right, appears at first to be a striking example of shamanistic transformation, a theme well known in the ethnography of band-level societies in the American tropics (Furst 1968). Here, however, the sculpture conveys a more specific cosmological message than the mere notion of the animal as a communica tor with the supernatural world. This jaguar wears a star in his headdress, which in Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions has been associated with the planet Venus (see Thompson 1962:108; also Kelley and Kerr [1973] for a discussion of the full range of the glyph's astronomical associations). The jaguar-faced regent of the day marked by the Venus glyph, Lamat, was called 1 Ahau by the Maya, and in his Classic-period anthropomorphic guise can be equated with the Hunahpu divine hero twin of the Popo/ Vuh (Scheie and Freidel 1990:411). I think it likely that the Cerro del Rey artist was conveying the imagery of this particular deity rather than the shaman's powers of supernatural transformation. The jaguar symbolism of the Rio Grande #1 stela is even more explicitly related to the ballgame cult's themes of under world death and rebirth. This jaguar, depicted in the diving-god position, has the head of the apparently dead, crossed-arm an thropomorphic figure in his jaws. Studies of Postclassic- and Classic-period manuscript painting and stone carving indicate that the "monster-maw" headdress in Mesoamerican art places its supernatural wearer in the underworld (Pasztory 1976:187), a location also conveyed in PCL conventions by the crossed-arm position. Two cartouche-enclosed glyphs name both the jaguar supernatural and his anthropomorphic partner. Although the calendric name of the human figure is less obvious, scrolls spill out of the cartouche on either side of the feline head in the lower</page><page sequence="13">Politics of Classic-period ritual interaction 133 Figure 10. Cerro del Rey carved stones: (a) Stela 1; (b) Stela 2; (c) Stela 3 (after Jorrin 1974:Figure 4). glyph, suggesting a likely identification with the Scroll Jaguar or Underworld Sun god.4 Much like Monument 7 from Bilbao, another monster maw sculpture with a crossed-arm celestial deity depicted in the mouth of the crocodilian Earth Monster, there are fronds of growing vines in the lower half of the stela. The plant imag ery, otherwise not as common in coastal Oaxaca art, is usually regarded as a metaphor for agricultural fertility in the PCL, constituting the earthly benefit of the underworld contest and its human reenactment in the sacrificial ballgame. In Maya cos mology, the underworld itself could be represented by waterlily vegetation thought to symbolize the primeval lake beneath the earth (Thompson 1970:220). Both the Cerro del Rey and the Rio Grande #1 figures wear calendric name glyphs that form enormous beltlike adornments. This general positioning of calendric names also occurs on sev eral of the Nopala figures as well, although it is not possible to distinguish all 14 individually from the published photographs of the monuments, many of which are broken or badly eroded (Jorrin 1974:Figures 8-14). At least five of the stelae (5, 8, 9, 13, and 14) portray what appear to be deceased individuals, with their arms, and in one instance feet, crossed in front of them. They lack calendric glyphs or other distinctive iconography. Jor rin (1974:77) likens them to "mummy bundles," and they could be either idealized representations of death or depictions of ac tual human sacrifices. Four of the Nopala stelae have date glyphs or other icono graphic symbols at their waists or in their hands. Stela 10, a female figure, judging from the pointed tunic she wears, is in complete and her glyph is too eroded to distinguish clearly. It is not illustrated here, but the monument seems to fall into this 4Joyce Marcus (1983a:137, 1983b: 144-146) has argued persuasively against identifying Zapotee "gods" on Monte Albán effigy urns and stone carvings where calendric names appear, as the great Oaxacanist Alfonso Caso had done. She finds that sixteenth-century Spanish sources failed to distinguish between deified supernatural forces (without calen dric names) and supernaturally powerful deceased royal ancestors (with calendric names). Applying her principle to the non-Zapotec Oaxaca Coast cultures discussed here clearly would eliminate many of my sug gested deity identifications, as it would those proposed for better known Late Classic stone monuments like the Xochicalco stelae (Pasztory 1976). Many of these images, however, are so dominated by recognizable re ligious attributes that if, indeed, their glyphs identified mortal humans playing divine roles, it is those religious functions that must have been paramount and conveyed power to the human actor. An alternative ex planation might follow the example set by the Popol Vuh, in which ca lendric names were commonly given to the supernatural protagonists of mythical events. More abstract cosmological forces are embedded in these stories which, perhaps because they recounted human-scale activ ities, required humanlike participants. An essential concept of the rit ual ballgame cult is that it centered around widely shared religious myths.</page><page sequence="14">134 Zeitlin Figure 11. Río Grande #1 stela, Museo Nacional de Antropología. group. Stela 2 (Figure 12b), with two bars representing the nu meral 10 at the figure's waist and a small glyph above, has the most obvious of these calendric inscriptions. The glyph resem bles the Maya reptile eye or "eye of darkness" symbol. Thomp son associated the Maya glyph with the Old Earth god, a possible link here as well suggested by the conch shell clasped in the figure's right hand (cf. Thompson 1971:Figure 21). Some kind of monstrous reptilian creature is shown on the figure's headdress, perhaps a representation of the Earth Monster itself. The supernatural quality of the Stela 4 figure is even clearer, although Jorrin and I differ on which celestial deity is repre sented on the worn surfaces of the monument (Figure 12d). What Jorrin (1974:68) considers a Tlaloc seems to me to have Venus-like goggle eyes and a buccal mask more in keeping with attributes of Quetzalcoatl. The fierce-looking individual repre sented on Stela 1 (Figure 12a) wears the "diving-star" Venus symbol from his belt or yoke, from which hang at least nine numeral dots. His hands hold a flint knife and a triple volute representation of a heart, also calendric/iconographic symbols with sacrificial connotations. Finally, I would like to call attention to one more figure from the Nopala group, Stela 3 (Figure 12c), which occupies an in termediate position between the iconographically identified supernaturals or deity impersonators and the unnamed deceased figures. He appears without an identifying glyph or calendric name, like the Nopala crossed-arm figures, and his hands touch at his chest, though they do not actually cross. In the mode of the Rio Grande #1 jaguar-mouth figure and other PCL mon ster-maw representations, his head is shown inside the open mouth of a crocodilian monster. Stylistically the Nopala, Cerro del Rey, and Rio Grande #1 artists drew from a common corpus of aesthetic conventions that included the full-frontal stance of the figures, the midtorso position of their calendrical names, and the manner of depict ing the numeral 5 as a tied bundle, as occurs at Monte Albán, Xochicalco, and Ñuiñe tradition sites. The lack of a cartouche to circumscribe the glyph elements among the Nopala figures, even more than their less-polished execution, suggests some lo cal variability within this tradition. None of the stelae in the group have specific ballgame referents; we find no costumed players among the carvings, and what little is known about their original sites does not indicate the presence of ballcourts (al though a ballcourt is reported for nearby Manialtepec) or the yoke and hacha complex. What they do share with the Middle Classic ballgame cult, however, is its essential ceremonial theme of human sacrifice as a replication of the fertility-enabling death of the celestial gods in the underworld. As with the monumental art from Río Viejo, crossed-arm death figures are represented prominently in this group, with at least five of the Nopala stelae, the Rio Grande #1 stela, and the two partly three-dimensional carved stones from Cerro del Rey (Figure lOb-c). On the Oaxaca Coast, death was displayed pub licly as a central religious preoccupation throughout the Clas sic period. By contrast, contemporary monumental art at Monte Albán emphasized the subjugation of territory and the taking of captives for inauguration rites, in a continuation of themes depicted in the earliest stone monuments at the site (Marcus 1983a: 137). Carved-stone crossed-arm or closed-eye figures do appear at Monte Albán, but here they are in the form of small greenstone plaques or three-dimensional greenstone or traver tine penates, the latter often executed in pairs or quadruplets. Occurring as part of votive deposits dated to Monte Albán Illb or IV (Caso 1965a:905-908), the plaques include some possible Maya imports as well as local carvings. The more elaborate ex amples portray the head of the deceased in an elaborate zoomor phic headdress or monster maw. Thus, while sacrificial-death motifs analogous to (and pos sibly inspired by) lowland religious concepts are present in later Classic Monte Albán art, they are subordinate to the more overtly political message prominently displayed on building walls and standing stelae. Significantly, the main ballcourt itself, so much the focus of religious expression in Classic-period PCL art, has little adornment other than its two interior niches. First constructed during the Terminal Formative (Monte Albán II), it occupies an important place on the ceremonial plaza of Monte Albán, and seven smaller Late Classic courts were distributed in outlying residential areas. But though the ballgame may have served important mediating functions within Monte Albán so ciety (Kowalewski et al. 1991:43), the attendant rituals of human</page><page sequence="15">Politics of Classic-period ritual interaction 135 0 50cm 0 50cm Figure 12. Examples of Nopala carved stones: (a) Stela 1; (b) Stela 2; (c) Stela 3; (d) Stela 4 (after Jorrín 1974:Figures 9-10). sacrifice and cosmological associations seem to have been un derplayed in the Zapotee capital. Given the low importance of the ritual ballgame cult in the Classic-period Valley of Oaxaca, it is not surprising that the ballgame is largely neglected by post Conquest historical sources on Zapotee myth and culture (Kowalewski et al. 1991:25). SOCIAL AND POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE LATER CLASSIC RITUAL BALLGAME Although this survey of Classic-period sculpture from the Oaxaca Coast has attempted to demonstrate that the sacrificial ballgame cult, with its artifactual paraphernalia and cosmological asso ciations, was widely adopted in this appendage of the PCL, it should also be clear that no orthodox version of the cult spread throughout the region. Many different artistic conventions are represented along the Oaxaca Coast, and different selections were culled at different localities from the totality of known cult attributes. Even the building of formal ballcourts appears to have been optional. While some of these local variations in style and content might be attributable to changes through time, for the most part they appear to reflect separate instances of local Oaxaca leaders embracing and promoting ballgame related themes and rituals, leaders whose spheres of political influence might have encompassed at most one or more neighboring lower river drainages. The unstandardized nature of the cult's expression further points to the absence of a single ideologically and politically dominant center whose influence might have shaped a more consistent pattern of local emulation along the Pacific Coast. Earlier I criticized the Parsons-Borhegyi proposition that Teo tihuacan merchant-emissaries carried the ritual ballgame cult to Chiapas and Guatemala. Indeed, the Oaxaca data indicate that cult participation was independent of interaction with Teotihua can. Some regions, such as the Rio Verde, show strong evidence of Middle Classic ties to Teotihuacan through obsidian usage and pottery styles. Others, like the Río de los Perros, indicate virtually no direct contact with Teotihuacan. Nor does there seem to have been a lowland rival or heir to Teotihuacan exer cising orthodox control over ritual performance and symbolic representation of the ballgame cult among lesser imitators, de spite its importance throughout the Classic-period lowlands. Weaver (1981:249) sees trade as the primary vehicle for the spread of the ballgame cult in the PCL. She cites the close asso ciation between traders, cacao, and the ballgame in Mesoamer ica generally (or at least at highland centers like Teotihuacan) and the specific iconographic association between the ballgame and cacao vegetation during the later Classic. R. Zeitlin (1979, 1982), noting the proximity of El Tajin to obsidian sources heav ily utilized by Classic-period communities on the southern Isth mus and elsewhere in the PCL, has postulated a prominent role for that center in the region's political economy, perhaps as a beneficiary of Teotihuacan's demise. But if EI Tajin did exercise some kind of trade monopoly in the distribution of obsidian throughout the PCL, direct influ ence from the north-central Veracruz site is hard to demonstrate in other spheres of interaction. Neither sculpture nor pottery styles along the Pacific Coast, highly variable as they are from the Guerrero border to western Guatemala, are strongly imita tive of those found at El Tajin, in contrast to the far-reaching nature of Teotihuacan influence in the lowlands. At the same time, shared pottery conventions and occasional trade pieces</page><page sequence="16">136 Zeitlin at several Oaxaca Coast sites support the proposition of more extensive interaction with particular Gulf Coast areas. Tixum phase collections from Saltillo manifest direct Late Classic ties with northern Isthmus populations in southern Veracruz and Tabasco. For the adjoining area of the eastern Oaxaca Coast, Brockington and Long (1974:86-96) interpret what appear as in trusive Tabasco pottery tradition traits in Late Classic and Early Postclassic contexts at Sipolite as evidence of actual western Maya immigration. Although there seem to have been numerous dyadic links between different PCL cultures, trade in itself has limited ex planatory value as a model of why the ballgame cult was so widely distributed in the Classic-period lowlands. Such a model implies that commodity exchange among lowland partners was pervasive and sufficiently intense to have carried with it many of the religious ideas of the traders, but it is a model based on economic assumptions not well suited to coastal lowland human ecology. While highland-lowland exchange has obvious eco nomic importance to both partners in the procurement of locally unavailable goods, exchange within the lowlands may have had less to do with the value of material things than with the value of the interpolity communication they represented. With the exception of a few commodities (obsidian being a notable example), there is great redundancy within the PCL in the geographical distribution of both raw materials, like salt, bitumen, and marine products, and climatically sensitive agri cultural commodities, like cacao and cotton. It seems unlikely that direct exchange between distant lowland partners was driven primarily by economic necessity. After all, most needed goods might as easily be procured from a nearer neighbor at less trans port cost, although certain centers may have been important conduits for the distribution of obsidian or desired highland products. Stark et al. (1992) suggest that such a role may have been played by the major urban center of Cantona, located close to the Zaragoza-zone obsidian source upon which both the Veracruz Coast and highland Puebla-Tlaxcala sites depended during the Classic. In the latter situation, it might have been advantageous for an ambitious lowland polity to dominate the others politically or militarily and channel the movement of lowland commodi ties through its own monopoly on trade with highland centers. As stated earlier, however, there is little archaeological evidence within the PCL pointing to any one such lowland center as the economic, political, or cultural kingpin during the later Clas sic, and the absence may be more than coincidental. Barbara Stark (1987:249) observes that the Veracruz-Tabasco lowlands did not produce major expansionist states that were able to overcome linear distance costs and control extensive coastal ter ritories. She attributes the limited scale of most Gulf polities to the difficulties they encountered in "bounding and administer ing a large population" (Stark 1987:250) in a geographic setting without clear environmental limits and without sharp contrasts in political organization among neighboring populations. If neither type of economically driven exchange—that in spired by local needs nor that imposed by a dominant polity— seems likely to account for the spread of the Classic-period ritual ballgame, we might take a closer look at the less materi alist approach espoused by Renfrew and Cherry (1986) in their concept of peer-polity interaction. It is a concept that attempts, albeit with mixed results, to escape the vagaries of both diffu sionist and evolutionist reductionary models by focusing on the mechanisms by which innovative ideas are spread among inter acting polities to create archaeologically observed structural homologies, especially those involving increased institutional complexity. As seems to have been the case in the later Classic PCL, the concept applies to autonomous chiefdoms or small scale states within a single geographic zone, where interpolity interactions were not based on principles of dominance and sub ordination, and where the observed cultural parallels cannot be attributed to environmental constraint or shared ethnic heritage. Increased trade in commodities, as we have discussed, is one obvious means by which innovative ideas may be spread and local production intensified, but the model draws special at tention to the exchange of information itself and the mecha nisms by which particular forms of communication operate to heighten intrapolity organizational complexity. Both agonistic interactions based on competition (from warfare to potlatchlike conspicuous displays and prestations) and more positive forms of emulation dubbed "symbolic entrainment" (Renfrew 1986:8) may be motivated by the desire of political leaders to enhance their own social prestige. At the same time these intergroup re lations will have wider institutional ramifications within the polity itself, stimulating economic productivity and social dif ferentiation. In the broad appeal of the PCL ritual ballgame, both polit ical competition and symbolic emulation may have operated to enhance interpolity communication. Recent thinking about the role of the ballgame in Mesoamerica has tended to emphasize its longstanding competitive, political boundary-marking func tions (Scarborough and Wilcox 1991). Ballcourts were often placed near political boundaries, the contestants frequently rep resented rival political leaders, and the game itself may have substituted for warfare. During the later Classic period, how ever, the articulation of the game's symbolic values through a ritually encoded religious message kindled its spread through the lowlands and beyond. Local leaders in some of the most peripheral regions em braced the game's ceremonial requirements and aesthetic prin ciples. The cult, with its central symbols of death, fertility, and cyclical time, would have offered its elite participants an ideo logically appealing opportunity to demonstrate their special role in the maintenance of the supernatural order and thereby justify their prestige and standing among their constituents. Although the diversity and eclecticism of the cult's regional manifestations suggest that there was no single cult center with an officially sanctioned iconographic standard to which all par ticipants adhered, very likely the recognition factor was suffi ciently high among all the different forms taken by death figures, celestial deities, and costumed ball players to permit mutual intelligibility among the elites from different regions. Components of a similar explanatory model have been pro posed by various authors to account for the Classic Maya cotra dition. Freidel (1986) and Sabloff (1986) have each considered how a peer-polity interaction model in general might be used in their respective explanations of Maya warfare and political de velopment. Diverse iconographic studies have explored the Maya ritual ballgame's particular relationship to interpolity war fare, interethnic trade, cyclical astronomical transitions, dynas tic succession, and other personal rites of passage among the ruling elite (e.g., Coe 1973; Cohodas 1991; Gutiérrez 1990; Scheie and Freidel 1991). While I have drawn frequently on Maya myth and visual imagery to interpret Classic Oaxaca</page><page sequence="17">Politics of Classic-period ritual interaction 137 Coast art, my intent here has been to suggest analogous mean ings derived from either broadly based pan-Mesoamerican con cepts or shared understandings between interacting cultural contemporaries. Ballgame rituals were of tremendous religious and political importance in both the PCL and the Lowland Maya region during the later Classic, but they contributed to different courses of sociopolitical development. The Classic-period PCL, particularly when we redraw its boundaries to include the Oaxaca Coast, constituted a much larger and, to judge from historical patterns, linguistically di verse interacting area than did the southern Maya Lowlands. Once Teotihuacan had withdrawn from its far-flung lowland enterprises, both the Gulf and Pacific coasts entered a phase of sustained population growth and political consolidation that produced numerous small-scale states or complex chiefdoms with their own limited spheres of cultural influence. Perhaps the largest of these polities, Late Classic-Epiclassic Tajin may have depended on a support population of 10,000 in the 5-km2 area surrounding the ceremonial complex (Weaver 1981:243, based on Krotser and Krotser 1973). Architectural copies of Tajin style are found at smaller sites like Cuetzalan more than 50 km away. Although wide-ranging in.estigations by the Proyecto Tajin since 1984 indicate that the site reached its full extent in the Early Postclassic, at least some subsidiary centers were occupied as early as the Middle or Early Classic (Briiggemann and Ortega Guevara 1989; Jiménez Lara 1992). Further south along the coast to Veracruz, another independent settlement hierarchy developed in Late Preclassic times in the Mixtequilla region and continued to prosper economically and culturally through the Classic period (Stark 1991, 1992; Torres Guzmán 1972). While ballgame-cult themes appear not to have been a significant focus of the long sculptural tradition at Cerro de las Mesas, the preeminent Mixtequilla site, their modest oc currence in Late Classic public contexts coincides with a period of great elaboration of ceremonialism and fine pottery styles (Miller 1991; Stark et al. 1991). On the Pacific coast of Chiapas and Guatemala, post-Teo tihuacan developments also led to a strong cultural florescence. Many new large sites were constructed and earlier centers aban doned during the Teotihuacan horizon were reoccupied, includ ing Abaj Takalik and Sin Cabezas, where several Formative sculptures were rededicated in front of new temples. As was mentioned earlier, recent studies of the Cotzumalhuapa ceram ics indicate that El Baúl, Bilbao, and El Castillo conform to this more general coastal pattern of post-Teotihuacan occupation or reoccupation (Hatch 1989:34). Surface surveys conducted by Bové in the Tiquisate and La Gomera/Sipicate regions give a clearer picture of the internal political relationships on the Pa cific Coast, revealing several apparently autonomous Late Clas sic settlement systems, each with its own complex hierarchy of primary-, middle-, and lower-level sites. The largest of these were statelike systems only 40 km apart, based at Ixtepeque and Texas, where well over 100 mound structures were spread over site areas of 100 and 500 ha, respectively (Bové 1989:49-54). Although we know less archaeologically about sociopoliti cal developments along the Oaxaca side of the Pacific Coast, the regional surveys conducted by Joyce and myself indicate Late Classic settlement systems along the lower Rio Verde and Rio Perros that fit comfortably within the Guatemalan parameters. Joyce finds the first indications of a three-tier settlement hier archy during the Classic-period occupation of Río Viejo, which swelled to cover over 3 km2. As regional capital, it dominated at least four secondary centers of 10 to 50 ha extent, each of which also had large mound construction and carved sculpture, traits usually missing from tertiary villages and hamlets (Joyce 1991:434). Along the Río Perros floodplain, Tixum-phase Sal tillo likewise dominated its middle- and lower-level riverine sub ordinates, both demographically and architecturally. On the southern Isthmus, although the Late Classic period witnessed a new level of cultural florescence, there was both more conti nuity with local Early Classic and Formative settlement patterns and less complexity at the secondary settlement level (J. Zeit lin 1978a:Table 6.1). These data from different sectors of the PCL allow us to complete a rough sketch of the Late Classic political landscape. Both the Gulf and Pacific coastal lowlands were dotted with independent polities, ranging in scale of complexity from ad vanced chiefdoms to small states. Their spheres of political con trol typically did not extend beyond the small riverine floodplain where the polity's administrative and religious center was lo cated, but more powerful centers may have controlled hinter lands at a distance of 50 km or more. Although both the Gulf and Pacific coastal lowlands are renowned for their pockets of precocious Formative-period development, the Late Classic and Epiclassic periods seem to have witnessed the most generalized florescence of sociopolitical integration in locality after local ity, as measured by such indicators as settlement number and ranking, size and architectural complexity of primary center, and public artworks. Overall population levels may have re mained high in much of this area until the Spanish Conquest, but Late Postclassic political integration, at least along the Pa cific Coast, was imposed by Mixtee, Zapotee, and Aztec colo nial powers. That these developments should have been so widespread throughout the PCL is, I believe, no coincidence. Analysis of the Oaxaca Coast public art from this period has underscored the importance of underworld ballgame rituals long recognized as important religious concepts within the Late Classic PCL. What the heterogeneity of their artistic expression in this zone makes clear is that these concepts were neither imposed by a dominant power nor introduced in an orthodox form by a sin gle group of proselytizing traders. Rather, local leaders em braced and promoted these powerful religious ideas, ideas which at once served to reinforce their privileged status within their own political communities and to facilitate their engagement in interpolity exchanges of goods and ideas. As predicted by the peer-polity interaction model, the consequence of sustained "competitive emulation" ought to be the kind of generalized increased levels of structural complexity we find throughout the PCL. Whether or not these panregional interactions in fact played an instrumental role in promoting PCL sociopolitical change, however, is a question that can be addressed concretely only by more detailed examination of the Late Classic record than the current state of lowland archaeological research permits. The failure of this period of widespread interaction among lowland polities to persist much beyond the Classic period may have something to do with both the size of the geographic zone involved and the difficulty of maintaining its communication network without stronger economic interdependency. In the end, expansionistic highland polities were able to assert their influence and control over many of the PCL's once-autonomous</page><page sequence="18">138 Zeitlin regions. For an interlude of several centuries following Teoti huacan's retrenchment, however, lowland leaders thrived in a competitive climate of political independence. At home they consolidated administrative control over large subject popu lations, while promoting themselves as embodiments of these robust corporate communities in the larger arena of interpol ity affairs. The ritual ballgame cult could provide both the oc casion for interaction among political peers and the religious symbolism by which chiefly authority was expressed. RESUMEN Para las culturas de la costa oaxaqueña, la época clásica fue un período de crecimiento de población y aumento de complejidad sociopolítica, como se manifestó en sus sistemas jerárquicas de asientamiento, sus grandes centros regionales, y la cantidad de sus estelas y otras esculturas monumentales. Un análisis iconográfico de piedras grabadas pertene cientes a seis sitios arqueológicos entre el Río Verde y el Río de los Perros indica que esas sociedades se preocuparon con ciertos temas religiosos. Estos fueron los mismos temas que predominaron en la región de las tierras bajas costeras periféricas durante el clásico tardío: la muerte y el renacimiento de los dioses celestiales en su paso al mundo subterráneo, hechos míticos representados por los ritos del juego de pelota. Sin un culto ortodoxo impuesto por un solo poder dominante, los jefes políticos independientes interpretaban los ritos al su parecer. Como monumentos públicos a la importancia política del grupo, las obras monumentales y su mensaje religioso servían para aumentar la fama de sus líderes entre los grupos extranjeros y para promover la diferenciación social aden tro su propria comunidad.
