<plain_text><page sequence="1">KORYAK RELIGION AND SOCIETY: AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS* PAUL J. MAGNARELLA ABSTRACT The article examines the interrelationships between Koryak religion and society. Taking a Durkheimian position, it is argued that the struc- ture of Koryak religion is the symbolic equivalent of the structure of Koryak society. Koryak rites of passage are also analyzed with the use of Van Gennep 's tripartite schema and Victor Turner's concepts of dominant and instrumental symbols. It is shown that the social order and purity of the ancestral cult are maintained by preserving the sanctity of the domestic hearth. Since the publication of Waldemar Jochelson's (1905-1908) and others' (Barret-Hamilton and Jones 1898; Kennan 1870; and Krasheninnikov 1764) ad- mirable ethnographic studies of the cultural, social, and religious life of the Koryak, a number of theo- retical advances have been made in the anthro- pological approaches to the study of "primitive" religions. In this paper I employ various theories and ideas offered by Durkheim (1965), Van Gennep (1960), Gluckman (1962), Turner (1967), and Douglas (1966) in a reexamination of the Koryak data. The paper is divided into two main sections. The first is primarily concerned with the inter- relationships between Koryak religion and social structure. The main hypotheses are that the Koryak belief systems concerning the nature of spirits and the universe are a direct function of their social organization and that the Koryak 's social structure as it existed at the turn of the present century cannot be understood without reference to their religion, nor can their religion be compre- hended without reference to their social structure. The theoretical orientation of this first section is largely derived from Emile Durkheim. The paper's second section dwells on three discrete events in the lives of the Reindeer Koryak - birth, marriage, and death. The analysis utilizes Van Gennep 's tripartite schema along with the theo- retical suggestions of others in an attempt to demon- strate how the rites of passage associated with these life crises are intricately intertwined with Koryak social structure and religion, especially their ancestral cult. The study will be preceded by a brief review of some pertinent ethnographic data. As the most use- ful of the available material was supplied by Jochel- son, the ethnographic present will be 1900-1901, the time of his actual field research. THE KORYAK The Koryak occupy Siberia's Kamchatka Penin- sula and hinterland and are divided into two eco- logically distinct and endogamous moieties: the Reindeer Koryak and the Maritime Koryak. According to the 1897 census each group contained approxi- mately 3750 members (Jochelson 1905-1908:445). The Reindeer Koryak, who are hunters, gatherers, and pastoralists, travel with their grazing herds in a seasonal cycle from the coast to the hinterland and back again along established routes. On the other hand, the sedentary Maritime Koryak live and work on the coast deriving their livelihood mainly from the sea. Total ecological adaptation is based on a symbiotic relationship between these two groups. During alternate seasons the food products of one moiety are largely supplemented by the food products of the other. Deer skins and seal skins *I wish to thank Dr. Peter Woolf son for reading an earlier version of this manuscript and offering constructive suggestions and criticisms. 24 Arctic Anthropology IX-2, 1972</page><page sequence="2">Magnar ella: Koryak Religion and Society 25 are also necessary to both for clothing. This mutual trade and exchange being so important, formalized communication and partnerships have been established between members of these two ecological groups. Jochelson writes that "Without a fixed system of exchange, these two sections of people could not exist" (1905-1908:764). Because of Russian contact, many of the Mari- time Koryak had embraced Christianity and had forgotten their native religion prior to Jochelson1 s field work. In contrast, the Reindeer Koryak had, to a considerable extent, preserved their native beliefs. In view of this development, the ethnog- raphy treated here will be only that of the Reindeer Koryak, and any conclusions reached will apply solely to them. THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE ORIGIN OF BELIEFS Durkheim argued that the religious concept is basically the symbolic equivalent of society or of its structure. A people's concepts of the super- natural derive directly from the models which their own society provides. Therefore, when seeking the origin of religion one must examine those relation- ships between distinct societal units which persist over generations. In order to test Durkheim 's theory in this case, I will examine the nature of the Koryak social organization and then determine whether or not it has been projected, extended, or replicated into the various levels of their belief system. The Koryak do not conceptualize the universe into a natural and a social order. Their universe consists of the integrated and patterned relation- ships of people, deities, spirits, matter, flora, fauna, climatic elements: in short, everything. They conceive of the universe as being divided into three main vertical layers. The upper level, including the sky and the heavens, is the home of the Supreme Being and other benevolent deities. The middle level or earth is occupied by people and the various earthly beings. In the layer below the earth are found the Kalau (evil spirits) and the souls of deceased ancestors. Except for the shamans, who are capable of entering the top and bottom strata in order to communicate with their occupants, all living men are confined to the earth. The requisites of ecological adaptation have un- doubtedly played a considerable role in the evolve- ment of the Koryak social system. The smallest social grouping is the agnatically related domestic unit, which is commonly an extended- patriarchal household. Upon marriage, daughters customarily leave their domestic unit of orientation and take up residence with their husbands1 kin. Familial authority rests firmly with the father, and seniority is a prominent criterion in determining the relation- ships of all other household members and all non- familial contacts. The patriarch is succeeded by his brother or eldest son. After the domestic unit the next larger social body is the territorial group or settlement, which is composed of from three to eight nuclear families that settle and graze their herds together. These domestic units may be only partially related by consanguineal or affinal ties. Quarrels within the settlement or limitations on grazing lands occa- sionally cause some families to leave one territorial group and join another. Just as the domestic unit is headed by its patriarch, so too is the settlement. According to tradition each settlement was founded by a male leader who manifested some extraordinary quality, for example, bravery. The people of the settlement, whether kin or not, identified with the founder and recognized him as their chief elder. They also recognized the right of his descendents to succeed to this position of leadership. The next higher societal level is the total Rein- deer Koryak population, composed of all domestic units and territorial groups. This level is acephalous, and identification is based on shared elements of ecological adjustment, language, and belief in a common ancestor. As one examines the other two levels of the universe, he readily discerns a projection of the Koryak 's actual social structure onto the commun- ities of the deities and spirits. The Koryak believe that the upper stratum is composed of families and settlements similar to those on earth. The Supreme Being is the chief patriarch and father of many other deities. Among his descendants who occupy the celestial settlement are the sun, moon, stars, and clouds. The patriarch's wife is often referred to as either Rain-Woman or Dampness-Woman. Not only have the Koryak projected their social order onto the deities, they have also projected their human shapes. All deities and spirits can take on anthropomorphic form. In fact, "Everything visible in nature, and everything imaginary, - that is, all that is within and beyond the limits of our visual powers . . . are thought of as material beings of an- thropomorphic form" (Jochelson 1905-1908:115). In their myths about the supernatural the Koryak explain the reason for this replication of social structures among themselves and the spirits and justify the totality of their way of life. They nar- rate how Big Raven, on the orders of the Supreme Being, descended to earth and introduced their social order. He also taught men how to fish; he gave them the sacred drum and fire-drill; he told them to burn their dead; and he protected them from disease and evil spirits. Big Raven lived like a man. He had brothers, sisters, a wife, and children. In time he</page><page sequence="3">26 Arctic Anthropology IX-2 disappeared. While the reasons for his departure are contradictory, some believe it was because men displeased him by not heeding his advice. The universe's subterranean stratum contains two distinct and separate habitations. The first is occupied by the Kalau , a society of malevolent spirits, who reside in settlements of patriarchal families just as humans do. They are ill-disposed to man and invade the earth bringing him sickness, disease, and disorder. Generally, they are invisible to ordinary people and can be seen and dealt with only by shamans. In the mythology, Big Raven and his children wage a constant war against the coarse and stupid Kalau, whom they vanquish by means of cunning devices. The second subterranean habitation is called "the country of the shadows. " It is the home of people who have lived and died on earth. The Koryak believe that each person has two souls. Upon death one ascends to the Supreme Being, while the second soul descends to "the country of the shadows," where it joins its other deceased relatives who all reside in the same house or settlement, continuing to live as they did on earth. The Koryak have even projected their societal structure on to the animals. As Jochelson writes: According to the Koryak ideas, the whales, like all other animals, constitute one tribe, or rather family, of related individuals, who live in villages like the Koryak. They avenge the murder of one of their number, and are grateful for kindness that they may have re- ceived (1905-1908:66). As a manifestation of these beliefs, the Koryak often symbolically treat slain animals as if they were visitors to their villages, who after a mutual ex- change of goods will return to their own societies. They believe that the hospitable treatment of these animals will encourage their relatives to grace the Koryak villages with visits also. It is interesting to note that the structure of the exchange relation- ship existing between slain animals and the Koryak is a replication of the trade partnerships extant between the Reindeer and the Maritime Koryak. STRUCTURAL PARALLELISM Another feature of the Koryak social and belief systems, which becomes readily understandable in the light of Durkheim's theory, is the parallelism existing between societal levels or units and the system of protective charms and powers. Each level of Koryak society, from the individual to the total nation, is distinctively marked by its own set of protective devices. Each individual possesses a set of Kamaks or guardians called "fellow travelers." These may be small human figures made from grass, wood, beads, or a wolf's or hare's hair. They are normally at- tached to the person's belt and are believed to provide protection against evil spirits. Along with Kamaks of this kind, each family must possess a drum which plays an important role in familial cere- monies. This and the sacred fire-drill (a board used for starting fires) rank among the most important guardians of the household. In addition, the do- mestic unit is also marked by a family shaman. Family shamanism is connected with the domestic hearth, whose welfare is under its care. The family shaman has charge of the family festivals, rites, sacrificial ceremonies, of the use of their charms and amulets, and of their incantations (Jochelson 1905-1908:47). The next larger social unit, the settlement, is also marked by its own protective Kamak. This is a forked wooden post called "the guardian of the habitation" and is usually placed on a hill over- looking the settlement by its male head. The Koryak nation as a whole was originally protected by Big Raven and his children. However, since their dis- appearance the people have had to rely on profes- sional shamans who reputedly enjoy very powerful protective spirits and extremely efficacious incan- tations. These shamans travel through the land working their power for any Koryak family or settle- ment. It appears that this group of specialists, in part, provides the cohesion for a society and system of beliefs which are dichotomized and partitioned into a number of vertical and horizontal divisions. (See Table 1.) ANCESTRAL CULT An examination of the Koryak1 s ancestral beliefs yields the most direct evidence for the hypothesis under consideration. The Koryak claim that each person has two souls. Upon death one soul ascends to the Supreme Being, who later sends it back to earth placing it in the womb of a married woman re- lated to the deceased. After the woman has given birth, her husband using a divining stone discovers which of the family's deceased relatives has entered his child. The process is incessant; the souls of the dead rise to the upper world and later return to earth in new forms. It is important to note here that a domineering principle in the Koryak conception of the universe is the belief in the quantitative permanence of the spiritual essence of man. nature, and the super-</page><page sequence="4">Magnar ella: Koryak Religion and Society 27 Table 1. Some Partitioned Categories in the Koryak 's Conceptual Scheme The Structure of the Universe Upper level Benevolent deities living in patriarchal households and settlements Earth level Man and nature living in patriarchal households and settlements Lower level Malevolent spirits living in patriarchal households and settlements Ancestors living in patriarchal households and settlements Structural Parallelism Social System System of Protective Powers Individual Personal guardians, "fellow travelers" Domestic unit Family guardians, drum, fire-drill, family shaman Settlement "Protector of the habitation" Koryak nation Big Raven and his children, professional shamans Some Dualistic Categories Level Dichotomy Man's souls That which ascends That which descends All nature External visible form Internal anthropomorphic form Spirits Benevolent Malevolent Nation Reindeer Koryak Maritime Koryak natural. Everything in their universe possesses an internal spirit and an external form. New spirits do not come into existence, nor do old spirits cease to exist. Instead, they may, from time to time, alter or completely change their external forms, while still maintaining the internal char- acteristics of their previous states (Jochelson 1905-1908:116). Therefore, by continually return- ing to the living family, the ancestral souls have the effect of maintaining the family's perpetual continuity and affirming its existence as a dis- tinctively discrete unit. The deceased's other soul descends to "the country of the shadows. " This underground an- cestral society continues to interact with its living relatives. Not only do the living and dead exchange food, but the ancestors also punish wrong-doers on earth. It is said that they once sent a Kala (evil spirit) to kill the inhabitants of a settlement be- cause the young people had been disrespectful to the elderly (Jochelson 1905-1908:103). These beliefs have two important consequences. Because the first souls of the dead continually re- turn to the families of their living descendants and take up new social positions among them, the an- cestral cult and the living are permanently inter- twined in a web of social relations that has no beginning or end, but rather is an ongoing circular process of kinship over multiple generations, which incorporates all three strata of the universe. As the second souls of the dead have the power to re- ward the culturally appropriate behavior and punish transgressors, they, in effect, sanction and enforce the social order of the living and the inter- spatial, inter-temporal social arrangement of which all spiritual essence is a part. Before proceeding to the second part of this paper, I would like to tie together some of the issues which have gone before. Up to this point, I have taken the opportunity of utilizing some of Durkheim's theoretical contributions in a reexamination of the Koryak ethnography. Earlier I hypothesized, and later</page><page sequence="5">28 Arctic Anthropology IX-2 demonstrated, that systematic relationships exist between the Koryak 's social structure and system of supernatural beliefs which are absolutely central to an understanding of either. It was further argued that the structural nature of their spiritual concep- tions was the product of direct derivations from the fundamental units of their society. In spite of the approach employed above, I do not hold that religion is always and everywhere an epiphenomenon of the social order. In some so- cieties it may be less a reflection of the social structure than in others. Generally speaking, the forces are mutually interpenetrating, and one must always be careful to examine two sets of factors: the influence of religion on social structure and the influence of social structure on religion. With respect to the Koryak, the societal influences ap- pear to be so great that I believe one can conclude that for them society is god. In the following sections I will examine some important events in the lives of the Koryak to demonstrate how the rites of passage associated with them are intricately tied in with their religion and social structure. RITES OF PASSAGE Rites of passage can be defined as prescribed formal behavior having reference to beliefs in mysti- cal powers and beings which are associated with the alteration of individuals1 statuses and social relationships (cf Turner 1967:19). In his classic study Van Gennep (1960:15-25) argued that the rites associated with the life-crises of birth, puberty, marriage, and death universally follow a similar order involving three phases: separation, transition, and incorporation. The first phase is characterized by the symbolic detachment of the individual or group from either a fixed point in the social struc- ture or a set of cultural conditions. The second or transitional phase is often an ambiguous time period for the subject. He occupies no set structural posi- tion, and is anomalous in the kinship system. In many societies he must undergo abusive treatment as part of the testing and education for a new social position. In the final phase, incorporation, the passage is completed with the subject installed in his new status. While Van Gennep made an important contribu- tion to the study of ritual mechanics, he did not investigate the role that ritual and ceremony have in the ordering and reordering of social relations. This is mainly because he lacked a developed theory of society (cf. Gluckman 1962:4-14). More currently, anthropologists have been attempting to view ritual in its broad social and cultural contexts. They endeavor to see it as a symbolic process structured by and dependent for meaning on the values, norms, collectivities, and roles of society. Not only is it associated with the structural move- ments of actors through society, but its component parts are examined for their meaning in recurring contexts. Victor Turner has divided the symbols which compose ritual into two major categories: dominant and instrumental. A dominant symbol occurs over and over again in many different ritual contexts, but it possesses considerable autonomy regardless of the rituals in which it appears. It retains a fixed point and meaning in both social and cultural spheres. In contrast, an instrumental symbol is dependent for its significance on the context in which it occurs. It acquires meaning in terms of the total system of symbols which compose a given ritual. As will be demonstrated below, the domestic hearth is a dominant symbol in the Koryak rites of passage. It manifests a special autonomy of sig- nification irrespective of its ritual environment. It occupies an exclusive place in both the social and cultural structures of Koryak society and represents values axiomatic to these structures. The hearth, along with its related sacra - fire-bow, fire-drill, head piece, leather bag - is the most sacrosanct component of any household. It is so intimately and exclusively linked with the living and dead rela- tives of a single domestic unit that its exposure to non-relatives can result in spiritual defilement. BIRTH "Before a child is born, the Supreme Being sends into the mother's womb the soul of some deceased relative of the child to be born" (Jochelson 1905- 1908:100). Parturition takes place inside the woman's sleeping tent, a place segregated from the domestic hearth. As soon as the child is born his father em- ploys a divining stone to learn the name of the an- cestor whose soul has been sent to it. The father enumerates the names of both his own and his wife's deceased relatives. When the correct name has been uttered, the divining stone begins to swing and the child ceases crying. After the discovery of the identity of the ancestral spirit who has descended to the child, the father carries the child from the sleeping tent, exposes him to the domestic hearth and other relatives, and announces that a relative has arrived. Jochelson reports a case where a child was named after his mother's deceased father. The father lifted his child and said to his wife, "Here, thy father has come" (Jochelson 1905-1908:100). It is evident here that the child assumes two structural positions simultaneously. The first is in his domestic unit of orientation, and the second is</page><page sequence="6">Magnar ella: Koryak Religion and Society 29 in his bilateral ancestral cult. Utilizing Van Gennep's scheme, we can say that separation oc- curs at the time of physical birth, when the child is extracted from the womb. The transitional stage is that span of time when the child does not pos- sess a name. During this period he is unclean in that he cannot be exposed to the hearth and his structural positions are not fully known. After his name has been discovered the child is exhibited to the domestic hearth and his relatives with the proclamation: "A relative has come." This repre- sents his social birth and formal incorporation into the domestic unit's socio- spiritual organization. It is important to note here that a child born out of wedlock cannot experience a social birth. This is because such a child is the product of a violation of religiously sanctioned, social norm (premarital intercourse is strictly forbidden by the Koryak) and can find no structural position in the Koryak 's socio- spiritual order. He is not the progeny of a marriage which has allied families in the manner prescribed by society. He has no father to divine his name; in fact, he can have no name. Being in violation of socio-religious norms, the child cannot receive an ancestral soul from the Supreme Being. Lacking a proper place in the order of things, the child is impure. It is delivered in the wilderness, away from the habitation, where it is promptly killed and buried. MARRIAGE The underlying concepts involved in marriage are the same as those found in the birth ritual. When a new bride is taken, she and her living kin acquire important positions in the social sphere of the groom's family. However, in addition and more importantly, she, her living kin, and all her deceased relatives are admitted to the domestic hearth. Thus marriage is a very serious institution, which unites two sets of living and dead kin into one socio- spiritual structure and causes the Koryak to prefer to take women from known families rather than strangers. As a result, there has been a tendency towards territorial and/or kindred en- dogamy. Customarily the young man's parents go to the parents of the potential bride to negotiate the bride- service and marriage. If the girl's parents agree to the arrangement, the young man separates from his own domestic unit to live in the home of his future father-in-law where he will perform a bride-service that may last from six months to three years. During this period he is not treated as a member of the domestic unit. In reality he has no position in it; this is the groom's transitional period. He enjoys neither the rights of a married nor of a single person. He is neither a member of his parents' domestic hearth nor of his wife's. He is given a poor bed and is ill-fed. "In a word, during his term of service, his endurance, patience, and meekness, his adroitness as a hunter, and his zeal and frugality as a herdsman are tested" (Jochel- son 1905-1908:740). After the groom has passed these tests, the bride's father gives the young man permission to marry his daughter, that is, to cohabit with her. Being forwarned of this, the girl with the help of her friends puts up a show of resistance. The at- tempt by the girl's friends to ward off the bride- groom is probably a ritual expression of the group's reluctance to lose a member. Following a symbolic struggle, the girl runs into her own sleeping tent where the groom captures her and consummates the marriage. This accomplished, the new husband and wife leave together for the home of the young man's parents. The bride's physical separation from her parents' home marks her social separation from a previous social status. Now both she and her husband are in transitional states as they travel through space to her affines1 home. As they ap- proach it, the groom's parents meet the bride with firebrands taken from the domestic hearth. This reception symbolizes the incorporation of the bride into the socio- spiritual cult which the hearth repre- sents. This incorporation is further symbolized by the bride's immediately setting about to prepare a meal on the hearth. The groom's crossing of his parents' threshold with a wife can be interpreted as his reincorporation into his parents' domestic unit in a new structural position - that of a married man. Later the two allying sets of relatives exchange visits. Each group meets the other outside its home with firebrands taken from its own domestic hearth. In this way the total merger of the two socio- spiritual cults is symbolized. DEATH The Koryak do not conceive of death as a natural process. It results from evil spirits or powerful shamans who cause a victim's chief soul - the one which ascends - to desert his body. However, this soul loss does not mean immediate death. Because the soul does not leave the earth at once, the victim is in a transitory state. He may be physically dead, but socially he is still alive so long as his soul is soaring above him. It is believed that shamans can return the lost soul and thereby restore life. The victim is pronounced dead only after it has been determined that his soul has been united with the Supreme Being. His body is then cremated in order</page><page sequence="7">30 Arctic Anthropology IX-2 to release his second soul which descends to "the country of the shadows" where it is incorporated into the society of its ancestors.1 Thus just as living persons do, the dead continue to occupy two structural positions in their families1 socio- spiritual organizations. The surviving kin sacrifice several reindeer near the funeral pyre so that the deceased may have these animals in the next world. The venison provides the basic fare for a large commensal gathering of relatives and neighbors. This final act may be viewed as a social crisis rite, whereby the solidarity of the social groups which have suffered a loss is reaffirmed in a large sacrificial meal. CONCLUSION In the second half of this paper I attempted to show how the Koryak rites of passage are con- spicuous representations of socio-religious status changes. Like all "primitive" societies, the loyalties, values, and norms on which Koryak so- ciety is based are so tightly interdependent that exaggerated ritual is required to separate social statuses into manifestly discrete units. These statuses are also intimately tied into the ancestral cult, whose sanctity requires that different social positions and groups not be confused. Social order and the purity of the ancestral cult are maintained by preserving the sanctity of the do- mestic hearth, which is charged with socio- religious meaning. Defilement of the domestic hearth occurs when social statuses or groups have been unconventionally mixed - when strangers have entered the domestic unit without first ob- serving appropriate norms. Proper admittance into a social unit is communicated by the prominent and possibly exaggerated exhibition of its most sacred symbol - fire from the domestic hearth. As Turner (1967) has theorized, the abstraction of socio-cultural elements via the display of their representative sacra stimulates initiates to ponder these important elements as they never may have done before. According to Durkheim religion and ritual are manifestations of man's social self, and their peculiar character is derived from the social order in which they are found. Durkheim further argued that the prime function of religion was to preserve, instill, and enforce the values and sentiments im- portant to society. Man conceived of religion as a means of rendering his social order sacred and legitimate. In return, religion offers future genera- tions models for appropriate social interaction, bases for evaluation, and ordering principles for the entire universe, all of which are in conformity with the established social order. Granted that this is true, what happens to re- ligion when its original basis for meaning, the social system, begins to change? In reply to this query, social scientists have said that a religion, to remain a viable and useful conceptual scheme, must change in conformity with its transforming society. Elaborately institutionalized religions, like Catholicism, have accommodated themselves to social change, even though their adjustments have been slow and subject to considerable re- sistance. However, under the strain of contact with a dominant people most native religions have failed to survive. Social and cultural metamorphoses have been too overwhelming. Former norms for be- havior and interpretations of life's meaning ceased to find a logical or efficacious place in the changing order of things. Therefore, it is logical to expect that the Reindeer Koryak have not preserved their native religion. Intensified contact with Russian missionaries, soldiers, administrators, and more recently the secular Soviet State have most likely obliterated another piece of the rich mosaic that is Asia. As a final note I would like to express my appreciation for Jochelson and men like him who have endured extreme hardship in order to record ways of life and thought which would have other- wise completely escaped the attention of history. *The ritual associated with death has not been as fully described in the ethnography as the two previous sets of ritual. For example, it is not known whether the fire used for the funeral pyre is taken from the domestic hearth. BIBLIOGRAPHY Barret-Hamilton, G. E. H. and H. O.
