<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN PECK BOOK OF THE DEAD? WE HAVE NO BOOK OF THE DEAD I have done no evil... I have not caused pain... I have caused no weeping... I have not brought suffering to anyone... I have not copulated, I have not misbehaved. Not that powers themselves fade. Their grip on us lessens. The final Apollo has been caulked and polished, the last Aphrodite sanded, oiled, and catalogued. It is time. Unrolling it down the pasture like a banquet tablecloth, helpers to the balloonist spread his red means slashed with puce and white like the puffed thighs of Swiss halbardiers at the Vatican, then they holler. Igniting the latent core of actuality, torching the anthropomorphism that passes for it, he aims a tubular frame into the vast yoke. Billows undulate around its bass hissing and swell. In a mauve frock coat from his great-grandfather s day, even though he is a sifter of fissionables in the era of miasmas, he pats a grey top hat, silver buttons. Pats his waist-high son, and checks the wicker pannier. His appearance says, No I am not capable of this. No, I have nothing to do with any of it, no, not this technë. Yet he will sail jetting flame in momentary dragonings up through puffed pleats. It has begun already: they stirruped him into the basket and slackened the anchoring guy ropes. The schools of philosophy were once ardent gangs competitive about the task: how to live. Caps wave, hankies. They worked out the protocols, tensed the cords, slipped them, the separation they celebrate gives a master to freedom. Such nuptials of possibility with discipline JOHN PECK I 75</page><page sequence="2">rely on a harmonic of tricks. Usually the flame wobbles, destroying. Gilda Larocca, taken in Florence in forty- four while running the shortwave, escaped to Milan with retinas scorched by the torturer s lights. She had said, No, I diàrii know that. No. No. She could still type, and so two patents, for ink that lovers could daub on rose petals and a couch that became a coffin, passed through her machine. A weightless stationery for amor in hells hour and a seat you take with you into weightlessness: the No begins to slide onto wilting surfaces. For Old Top Hat, the basket stays basket. His frock coat is no mesmeric bon-bon of the escape artist. His drift is not away, but across the live and furry in a mirror of the dive. He wagers the dimensions, up as down, as free-fall, and pollen big as towns, a seeing particle among the particles, roar then silence. Metaphysician, and how not watch him? Craning my neck back, again I see boys drop snowballs down the face of Strasbourg s cathedral, who, if interrogated would say, No we didnt do that, while what attacked was not their toys, it was the air: a stinging tartness with molecular teeth, supplements from Trinity, the Reich, Poland, Japan, Brazil, Bikini through one lifespan. Whiteness muffled the whole cliff though one might still hear, in all the languages, Nò, we didn't, no, not us. Couples at the portal under the gallery gawked up at dots enlarging then ducked among the layered saints and queens. And here I am watching a maestro: he leans from the rim coiling in a rope, receding as slowly as Mr. Tanimoto in Hiroshimas park rowing his loads away from the flames with a bamboo pole. The fire works for him this time. They are safe. He is diving. Through his ropes the buzz of the lived plane resolves to a hum, pattern and heaviness apart for an interval. From the third outrider of an unnumbered sun, lifting as diving - this, too, the human may arrange and patent 76 CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="3">if it has sat to its task, lived its dual nature, for though sandbag conscience will lift with it, grey ballast, all has been readied by sandy Egyptian sagacity to deny complicity. For it is human to say, Noy I have never sinned, noy not, bare-faced to the powers. JOHN PECK 77</page></plain_text>
