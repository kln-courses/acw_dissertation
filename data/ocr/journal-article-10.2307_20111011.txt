<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Wata-da-ge in Ceylon: The Circular-Relic-House of Polonnaruva and Its Antecedents Dir?n K, Dohanian The Wata-d?-g? at Polonnaruva is one of the most splendid of the monuments surviving at that ancient royal city in Ceylon. It stands, along with a number of other shrines, on a high rectilinear terrace, or quadrangle, which was probably known in olden times as the Dalad? Maluv?, or "Terrace of the Tooth Relic". The Wata-da-ge is a circular structure, a pillared hall, raised upon a series of round terraces and enclosing a stupa1 (Fig. 1). It represents the survival, in Ceylon, of an ancient Indian type of thupa-ghara, or stupa house, of which no structural examples and only two or three rock-cut replicas are extant in India itself.2 The lower terrace of the shrine forms a broad circle about 120 feet in diameter. On the north, there is a T-shaped porch with a flight of stone steps by means of which one enters the shrine. The terrace and its porch are paved and faced with smooth slabs of stone. The stairway is elaborately ornamented and begins its ascent from a characteristic moonstone slab. In the center of this platform rises a second, smaller stone-faced terrace, about 80 feet in diameter and reached by four stone stairways which mark off the quadrants of the circle. This .?aTMB?. terrace supports the shrine proper whose outer limit is defined by a thick brick wall, about 15 feet tall and pierced at four places by doorways, each one aligned with a set of stairs. About two feet outside of the brick wall runs a ring of octagonal stone pillars, 3 2 in number, each about 8 feet high and with a spreading capital, pro fusely sculptured. The lower portions of these pillars are connected by a short stone wall whose outer face is richly carved in a continuous pat tern of four-petalled blossoms. Where the low wall is interrupted by doorways, it makes a right angle return to butt against the brick wall behind Fig. 1. The Wata-d?-ge at Polonnaruva. (Photograph, author). 31</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 2. The Wata-d?-ge at Polonnaruva. View of the inner shrine. (Photograph, author). it. The base of the short stone wall is formed as a double-lotus moulding which continues un broken around the bottoms of the pillars as well. Inside the encircling brick wall are ranged two concentric rings of stone stumps, the remains of an interior system of pillars which numbered 16 on the inner ring and 20 on the outer. A fallen pillar, relatively intact, has a shaft which meas ures over 14 feet, giving the pillars on the inner rings a total height greater than that of the brick wall and considerably greater than that of the outermost circle of posts. At the center of the shrine, immediately with in the double row of stone pillars, is the triple base of the st?pa itself. This is built of moulded brick. It is stepped and decreases in its diameter from 27 feet 8 inches at the level of the terrace to about 23 feet at the point where the anda of the st?pa began. The remainder of the st?pa is no longer extant. But within its rubble core is apparent the remains of a brick-lined chamber, about 3 feet square and 10 feet deep, which once housed the sacred relic. At the bottom of the relic-shaft was found a nine-chambered yantra, made of brick. And in the rubble around it were found some niched stone slabs, a stone yantra of 25 chambers, and a copper coin of Nissamka Malla. The st?pa has been thoroughly looted and we have no way of knowing exactly what the deposits were. Around the st?pa, in line with the innermost ring of stone pillars, and corresponding in place ment to the doorways and stairs of the shrine, are four stone images of the Buddha, seated in the dhy?na position on chastely carved stone thrones (Fig. 2). The remains of additional pedestals, built from brick, fill the intervals of the innermost colonnade of the shrine. The Wata-d?-ge was topped by a domed and vaulted double roof, probably constructed of wood and tile.3 The encircling brick wall was finished with a thick coating of lime plaster and its doorways fitted with lattice doors. The facing of the upper terrace and the stairways which provide access to it are richly carved with sym bolic figures, originally polychromed. The ulti mate effect of the Wata-d?-ge of Polonnaruva must have been quite splendid; and it richly deserved the epithet, "Ratnagiri", assigned to it by the king, Nissamka Malla. In an inscription of that monarch, found in cised on the stone wall of the entrance porch of the shrine, it is stated that "after he (Nissamka Malla) had been anointed king in the noble city of Pulatthinagara, he caused the tooth-relic to be exhibited and made offerings to it. Further, he sent for his general Lak Vijaya Singu Tavura navan and caused him to build on the maluva an inimitable circular relic house and named it Ratna-giri(ya)."4 This information is repeated exactly in another inscription of Nissamka Malla cut on a rock in Polonnaruva, near the Vishnu Devale on the Minneri-T?p?veva Road.5 The information given in these inscriptions, together with the find of a coin of Nissamka Malla in the rubble of the st?pa, would seem to leave no doubt that the Wata-d?-ge at Polon naruva was a construction of Nissamka Malla, who reigned from 1187-1196 A.D. But the Mah?vamsa credits the building of the Wata-d?-ge to that greatest among the Polon naruva sovereigns, Par?kramab?hu I, who reigned from 1153-1186 A.D. In the record of his mighty acts.his building activity alone takes up more than two chapters.the chronicle lists "a round temple for the Tooth Relic, built wholly of stone and adorned with 32</page><page sequence="3">beautiful pillars, staircases, walls, terraces, and such like".6 The excavator of the Wata-d?-ge, H. C. P. Bell, was inclined to believe that this shrine was indeed the Tooth Relic Temple of Par?krama b?hu I.7 On the other hand, Paranavitana, in his classic study of the st?pa in Ceylon, has given the work to Nissamka Malla. But he has ex pressed the suspicion that Nissamka Malla did not construct the Wata-d?-ge from scratch, but that he repaired and embellished an edifice al ready existing.8 Paranavitana noted a disparity in the stonework of the lower and upper terraces and the incorporation into the design of some sculptural fragments apparently taken from the ruins of earlier buildings. In more recent pub lished comments on the shrine, Paranavitana has expanded this suspicion into the opinion that the Wata-d?-ge of Polonnaruva is a cetiya-ghara of a much earlier date, repaired and embellished by Nissamka Malla; that the encircling brick wall "dates without doubt from the reign of Nissamka Malla", as does the lower circular terrace with its projecting porch and steps; but that the shrine, in its essential structural features, is the work of an era considerably earlier than what is generally understood as the Polonnaruva Period. He sup ports this contention with the observation that "Polonnaruva was the seat of Sinhalese royalty on more than one occasion during the eighth to tenth centuries" and that "the chronicles refer to religious edifices founded in that city before it became the centre of administration in the eleventh century." In addition, he invokes a comparison with other Sinhalese examples of the Wata-d?-ge type of shrine, which may be dated in the seventh or eighth centuries.9 It is my opinion that neither Bell nor Parana vitana is wholly correct nor wholly mistaken as to the date(s) and authorship of the Wata-d?-ge at Polonnaruva. To my mind, there is no doubt that this shrine was fashioned during the reign of Par?kramab?hu I and enlarged during the reign of his successor and rival, Nissamka Malla. We may assign to Nissamka Malla, and to the early years of his reign, that portion of the shrine which bears his inscription. The upper terrace and the shrine proper, including the encircling brick wall, in their essential features, belong to the time of Par?kramab?hu I, again probably to the early years of the reign. The twelve brick image-pedestals around the st?pa are later addi tions, generally attributed to the middle of the thirteenth century. Paranavitana has rightly associated the Wata d?-ge at Polonnaruva with the Th?p?r?ma at Anur?dhapura, reputedly the most ancient st?pa in Ceylon; with the Lank?r?ma D?goba at Anur?dhapura; with the Ambasthala D?goba at Mihintale, said to contain the corporeal relics of the apostle Mahendra; with the d?goba of Siri sanghabodhi at Attanagalla; and with the beau tifully preserved shrines at Tiriy?y and Medirigi riya.10 In each case, the general design is the same: a circular pillared shrine encloses a st?pa. It is comprised of a broad platform from which rise concentric rings of stone pillars of progres sively greater height, intended to support a vaulted roof. Most of these monuments are fair ly well preserved, though all but the shrines at Tiriy?y and Medirigiriya have undergone refur bishment in modern times and for none of them can we claim that the encircling shrine is as ancient as the st?pa itself. And to these exam ples we may add a substantial number of others of which only the foundations and postholes re main: at Vessagiri, Toluvila, Sigiriya, Rajangane, Manikdena, and Virandagoda.11 These monu ments are found at various sites all over Ceylon and their very number suggests that the circular th?pa-ghara was a not unusual feature of monas tery planning in ancient Ceylon. But among these examples there is a surprising variety in the design, especially with respect to its component parts. Some of this variety may be the direct function of size. Size varies from 37 feet in the Toluvila example to a colossal 165 feet in the Th?p?r?ma, and the size of the shrine generally varies in proportion to the size of the st?pa which it houses. But not all of the variations issue from considerations of a practical nature. The number of concentric rings of pillars varies from four in the Th?p?r?ma to three in the Lank?r?ma, and in the examples from Medi rigiriya, Polonnaruva and Rajangane; to two at Mihintale, Tiriy?y, Attanagalla, Manikdena and Toluvila; to one at Virandagoda and none at Sig iriya, where an encircling wall with one entrance at the north provided the sole support for the roof. The number of entrances varies from one at Sigiriya and Toluvila to two at the Th? p?r?ma; to four at the Lank?r?ma, at Mediri giriya, Tiriy?y, Rajangane, Manikdena and Pol onnaruva. The shrines at Mihintale and Attana galla have been so completely renovated in mod ern times that it is impossible to know how many entrances the terraces had in earlier times. As for 33</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 3- The Wata-d?-ge at Medirigiriya. (Photograph, Archaeological Department of Ceylon). Fig. 4. The Wata-d?-ge at Medirigiriya. The shrine proper. (Photo graph, author). the encircling brick wall just inside the outer most colonnade, it is found clearly in evidence only at Medirigiriya and Polonnaruva. But traces of such a wall had been noted earlier at the Th? p?r?ma and Lank?r?ma shrines12 whereas no traces of an encircling brick wall have been found in the other examples. At Tiriy?y, how ever, the stone retaining wall of the terrace had been continued up to form a freestanding wall, about 10 feet high, which closes in the shrine at the very circumference. While most of the st?pas in these shrines rise from triple-stepped circular bases, the st?pa at the Th?p?r?ma13 has under it an additional broad platform which is shaped like a circle with rec tangular projections at the cardinal points, this shape recalling that of the st?pa platforms at N?g?rjunikonda and other sites in the ?ndhra country. In the shrines at Toluvila and Sigiriya, the base of the st?pa sits upon a squared, rather than circular, ledge.14 At Tiriy?y, four stone "flower altars" are placed around the st?pa, marking off the major directions, but no fragments of sculpture were found there.15 The shrine at Medirigiriya, how ever, shares with that at Polonnaruva the dis tinguishing feature of four stone Buddhas, placed against the st?pa and opposite the entrances. I know of no other surviving example which has this feature. The shrine at Medirigiriya also shares with the Wata-d?-ge at Polonnaruva the element of a short stone wall linking the pillars of the outer colonnade and joining the brick wall at the doorways. This feature also is found in none of the other examples. Paranavitana's as sumption that such a rail existed in wood at the Th?p?r?ma,16 for example, is discredited by the fact that the stone pillars there have no mortices in which a wooden rail could have been fixed. The foregoing rehearsal of statistics is intended to dramatize the fact that although the circular st?pa houses of Ceylon all conformed, in a gen eral sense, to a single type, their design was con siderably varied. No example is in every respect like another. It would be comforting, of course, if we could discover in this variety a develop ment of architectural and symbolic form clearly progressing from the most ancient example to the most recent. But this is not possible, for the most ancient of these shrines have been subject to periodic refurbishment, in olden times as well as modern, and the best preserved of them dis play components which can be securely dated no earlier than the seventh century. But this group of shrines may afford a basis from which to project a reasonable and logical general development. The extant and known examples of the Wata-d?-ge fall easily into three major groups, in which we may discern the three general categories or types of the shrine. The first type is an open pillared hall.17 The second is a closed pillared hall. And the third is a closed pillared hall which is a composite of the st?pa house and the image house. If we take the first type to represent the earliest form of the th?pa ghara, then we may conjecture a development, in time, from the open type to the closed type to the composite type. And in at least one com ponent of the design, we may see a development from the projecting platform of the Th?p?r?ma st?pa to the "flower altars" at Tiriy?y to the en throned images of Medirigiriya and Polon naruva.18 The hybrid st?pa-image hall may ac tually represent the last phase in the develop 34</page><page sequence="5">ment of the circular th?pa-ghara in Ceylon. Or it may represent only a late and special type. The two examples of this type are the ones found at Medirigiriya and Polonnaruva. The Wata-d?-ge at Medirigiriya (Fig. 3) is the principal shrine of a monastic site which in ancient times was known as "Mandalagiri Vih?ra".19 It is built upon the summit of an out crop of bare rock and is entered from the north by means of twenty-seven stone steps, a high oblong platform, and a second flight of four stone steps. Its circular terrace is 91 feet in diam eter and it is sustained by a retaining wall of brick and mud mortar reinforced in places by rough-hewn blocks of granite. The shrine itself (Fig. 4) is like that of Polonnaruva, with three concentric rings of oc tagonal pillars, the remains of a brick wall en circling it just within the outer colonnade, four wide doorways, and a short stone wall connecting the outermost ring of pillars and turning at the ends of each quadrant to join the brick wall. Within is a demolished brick st?pa rising from a moulded limestone plinth. Four Buddha images (Fig. 5), carved from limestone and placed on limestone thrones, are ranged around the st?pa at points directly opposite the four doors to the shrine. It is easy to see that this Wata-d?-ge, in the ar rangement of its major components, corresponds to that at Polonnaruva. Moreover, the inner di mensions of the two shrines are the same. They have the same number of pillars in the sequence of concentric rings (16, 20, 32). The heights of the pillars in the middle and outer circles cor respond (16 feet and 8-9 feet). In addition, the base of the short stone screen takes the form of a double-lotus moulding which runs around the bottom of the pillars as well. The differences between the two shrines are primarily two. In the first place, the sculptural enrichment of the Wata-d?-ge at Medirigiriya is consistently more spare than that of its coun terpart at Polonnaruva and is of a fundamentally different order. This is a function of their rela tive chronology. Secondly, whereas the shrine at Polonnaruva has four stairways of approach to its principal terrace, that at Medirigiriya has only one. This difference is dictated by the topog raphy of the sites. It is due to the dramatically irregular terrain at Medirigiriya and, in part, to the orientation of the shrine on the rock to the rest of the monastery below. To my mind, these differences are not so com pelling as the correspondence between the two shrines and the fact that they are more like each other, both in general plan and in a number of specific details, than any two of the other th?pa gharas of Ceylon. This fact seems to suggest some kind of special connection, historical or iconographie, between the two. The th?pa-ghara of the Mandalagiri Vih?ra is traditionally regarded as a construction of the reign of Aggabodhi IV in the third quarter of the seventh century. An inscribed gold-foil sheet found deposited under one of the pillars, presumably the first to be erected, contains Sinhalese characters of seventh to eighth century date.20 In another study, I have placed the stone images of the Mandalagiri Wata-d?-ge in the sec ond half of the eighth century.21 And I consider them to be contemporary with the structure, since they are an integral and integrated compo nent of its meaning. The Wata-d?-ge at Mediri giriya, then, is considerably earlier in date than that of Polonnaruva if the latter is indeed a con struction of Par?kramab?hu I. It is probable, Fig. 5. The Wata-d?-ge at Medirigiriya. Vieiv of the inner shrine. (Photograph, author). 35</page><page sequence="6">therefore, that the later structure is in some way derivative from the earlier. This assumption be comes more attractive when it is supported by the record of certain events in the career of Par?kramab?hu I as given in the Mah?vamsa. Prince Par?krama, before his accession to kingly power and in order to seize the throne of Ceylon, waged war against the king of Polon naruva, his cousin, Gajab?hu II. After a series of decisive battles, when Gajab?hu's defeat was imminent, a company of leading bhikkhus inter vened and effected a reconciliation of the two princes. A treaty was made allowing Gajab?hu to retain the throne until his death provided he recognized Par?krama as his legitimate successor. The chronicle records that Gajab?hu then went to the Mandalagiri Vih?ra and made a solemn declaration there saying "I have given the king's country to king Par?krama".22 This treaty and its terms are also recorded in a rock-cut inscrip tion discovered at the ancient site of the Sangamu Vih?ra in the Kurunegala District.23 The proclamation of Gajab?hu II at the Man dalagiri Vih?ra was perhaps the most important single event in Par?krama's career prior to assum ing the throne as king of Lanka. The Mah?vamsa pictures Par?kramab?hu I as a man keenly aware of his own history and records that monuments and st?pas were erected during his reign at places connected with his career. It is entirely in keeping with the historical image of Par?kramab?hu I, thus presented in the Mah?vamsa, to imagine that he regarded the Mandalagiri Vih?ra with special interest and that he manifested that interest by reproducing, in his capital city, the shape and appearance of its principal shrine. What I mean to suggest is that Par?kramab?hu I may have built the Wata-d?-ge at Polonnaruva in emulation of the beautiful shrine at Medirigiriya and as a lasting memorial of that great day when he was proclaimed the future king of Lanka. On the other hand, it may have been that the bhikkhus of Mandalagiri were sufficiently power ful to exercise influence on Par?krama and that they became important members of his court. Perhaps they persuaded the king to erect on the Dalad? Maluva a Wata-d?-ge like the one at their home monastery. These are two among a number of possibilities. Whatever the specific historical situation, the general historical context, as suggested in the Mah?vamsa account and the Sangamu Vih?ra inscription, indicates a special relationship be tween the court at Polonnaruva and the vih?ra at Medirigiriya. And that special relationship is reflected in the formal and symbolic correspond ences between the Wata-d?-ge at Polonnaruva and its model at Medirigiriya. I say symbolic correspondences because I be lieve that the incorporation of the four Buddha images into the architectural symbolism of the st?pa-shrine substantially altered its iconological significance and distinguishes the shrine so en riched in meaning from others of the general type. The Buddhist st?pa, taken by itself and re gardless of its size, may be understood as an ab stract symbol of the cosmos invested throughout with spiritual power by reason of the relics and magic signs interred in its center. At the same time, it is the sign of the Buddha's Nirvana, his ultimate triumph over Life, and of the Buddha's Dharma, the liberating and sustaining principle of the Universe. When the st?pa is installed as a cult image and is used as the object of worship, it assumes, through usage, the quality and char acter of an iconic form and reflects, in a general way, the nature of the Divine as Being. When the st?pa has imposed upon it, or fused into it, the iconic and anthropomorphic shape of the Buddha, it is rendered more explicit an embodi ment of the concept of Divine Power manifest as Being. At the same time, such a composite emblem has the power to correlate, before our eyes as it were, spiritual power as Essence and its manifestation as Being. The multiplication of the Buddha image and its diagrammatic disposition around the st?pa in creases the theological specificity of the com posite emblem and enhances its symbolic mean ing. Multiple Buddhas, cosmographically ori ented, individually embody Spiritual Power as Being and collectively partake of the mysterious and mystical efficacy of a diagram, recalling the immutable order beyond phenomena. What I am talking about, of course, is the subtle and progressive transformation of the st?pa emblem from a Hinay?na sign into an ef fective Mah?y?na symbol. This transformation took place, wherever it did so, under the pressure of doctrinal need and is the direct function of theological evolution. One of the bases of Mah?y?na thought is the notion that the Buddha is eternal and transcen dent, yet immanent and manifest. This view 36</page><page sequence="7">differs in kind from the beliefs of the Thera v?dins concerning the nature of the Buddha. They held steadfastly to the concept of the Buddha as an historical personage who, through rigorous self-control and world-renunciation, at tained omniscience. Although they attributed to him superhuman powers and regarded him as superior to all beings, they did not think of him as eternal or preternatural. The Mah?y?na riddle of the Eternal-Manifest is full of contradiction since it predicates for the Buddha a multiple existence, Essential and Phe nomenal. The solution of this riddle and the resolution of its contradictions is the history of Mah?y?na Thought and Iconography. The point, here, is that the st?pa which incorporates into its symbolic fabric the anthropomorphic image of the Buddha is in fact expressive of an exclusively Mah?y?na concept. And when the Buddha image is multiplied and forged into a single symbolic entity, we have gone far beyond that elusive borderline between Hinay?na and Mah?y?na thought. The Wata-d?-ge at Polonnaruva, then, and its prototype at Medirigiriya must be understood as Mah?y?nist monuments. The st?pa at the center may be read as an emblem of the Dharma: Essen tial, Absolute, Unconceived and Unmanifest. The four Buddha images disposed cosmograph ically around it embody, together, the simultan eous, phenomenal, and manifest projections of the Absolute throughout all Space. On the face of it, the Wata-d?-ge at Mediri giriya constitutes something of an invention and marks the moment of the iconographie transfor mation of the circular relic-house in Ceylon. It comes as no surprise to find at Medirigiriya a shrine of conspicuously Mah?y?nist character. For Mandalagiri was an ancient vih?ra whose re mains witness to a substantial Mah?y?na phase lasting from the eighth century through the tenth and probably later. This phase coincides with the period of the vih?ra's greatest fame and influence. But, if I am correct in assuming that the Wata-d?-ge of Polonnaruva is a twelfth cen tury "copy" of an essentially Mah?y?nist monu ment and that Par?kramab?hu I was the patron who ordered its construction, the historical situ ation this suggests is not lacking in a certain irony. For Par?kramab?hu I, in the historical mythology of Lanka, is regarded as the Sinhalese ecumenicist par excellence whose greatest kingly act was the reconciliation of Ceylon's Buddhist sectaries and the restoration to ecclesiastical su premacy of the followers of the Therav?da. Still, the Mah?y?nist character of the Wata d?-ge at Polonnaruva, and of its model, does not reflect a cultural abnormality. The role of the Mah?y?na in the cultural development of Ceylon has been grossly underrated, both in the tradi tional histories and in modern commentary. (It may be said also that the special character of ecclesiastical reform in ancient Ceylon has not been understood.) The archaeological remains alone suggest a widespread Mah?y?na cult flour ishing from the seventh century until the devas tation of Anur?dhapura in the tenth. And there is considerable evidence for the survival of Ma h?y?na institutions well into the fifteenth 24 century. Moreover, other Sinhalese shrines, roughly con temporary with the Polonnaruva relic-house, carry the same Mah?y?nist meaning. One of these is found among the other structures on the Dalad? Maluva at Polonnaruva and is situated almost opposite the Wata-d?-ge. It is the so called Sat-mahal-p?s?da (Fig. 6). This is a unique example in Ceylon of a stepped shrine, solid, brick, square in plan and rising in seven stories of gradually diminishing size. Each story, on each face, is articulated by a shallow niche, fronted with a broad flat arch and containing a standing image of a Bodhisattva.25 This shrine is a construction of Nissamka Malla and is a special kind of st?pa which represents the Cosmic Mountain, bared of its celestial canopy and revealing, on its multiple stages, the projected phantoms of the divine Reality irradi ating from its center. Similar st?pas are known in Siam and there is in the collection of the Se attle Museum a small P?la ivory st?pa which shows a squared terraced pyramid crowded with the manifest forms of the Divine (Fig. 7). Buried within the core of the Sat-mahal p?s?da are the remains of an earlier brick shrine which was built upon a square basement and around a solid octagonal core of at least two stories.26 The lower story of the core was en closed by a massive square structure which al lowed for an eight-sided ambulatory within. Each face of the surrounding structure was pierced, at its center, by deep archways which gave access to the ambulatory. And each face of the eight-sided core, at both extant levels, con tained a niche for a stucco-formed image. 37</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 6. The Sat-mahal-p?s?da, Polonnaruva. (Photograph, author). It is easy to see how the symbolic character of this shrine is identical to that of the st?pa which encloses and replaces it. Also the incorporation of an ambulatory passage and four entranceways likens it to the Wata-d?-ge across the quadrangle and suggests a corresponding integration of the image-hall and st?pa-hall into a new and special type of shrine. The remains of yet another solid brick shrine, similar to the Sat-mahal-p?s?da, have been found at Anur?dhapura. Dubbed the Nak? Vih?ra,27 this shrine was square in plan with broad projec tions, or bays, on each face. Five niches, three on the bay and the others on the flanking re cesses of the wall, were fashioned across each face of the only surviving story. We do not know whether this was a multi-storied or stepped shrine. However, there is on the top of the sur viving ground story the remnant of a square celia surrounded by four stone disks, marking out at least a second major level. The shrine stood on its own square platform which was en tered from the south by means of a flight of stone stairs and a small portico. Inside the shrine, buried in its solid core, was unearthed a series of small clay st?pas; the niches on the outside must have been prepared to hold images of Buddhas, perhaps flanked by Bodhisattvas. If the st?pas enshrined within are taken for emblems of the Dharma-k?ya and the images without for its manifestations as "Being", then we have in the Nak? Vih?ra another expres sion of the most sophisticated of Mah?y?na concepts. The Nak? Vih?ra is thought to have been built sometime in the tenth century, before Anur?dha pura was abandoned and ravished by the armies of Chola Rajaraja I. It represents therefore a moment in time between the circular-relic-houses of Medirigiriya and Polonnaruva and suggests the continuity of the ideal expressed in all. An earlier shrine, probably earlier than the Medirigiriya example, is also found at Anur?dha pura. It has been scarcely noticed because its remains are so scanty. I shall call it the Shrine of the Buddha of the Outer Circular Road.28 This shrine is situated in the Abhayagiri area of the ancient city and originally consisted of a square sanctum, defined by eight squared stone pillars and thick walls of brick which had been moulded at the base. On the four faces of the sanctum, rectangular brick projections supported four stone Buddhas seated in the dhy?na position, of which one has been preserved intact. Frag ments of two others survive and of the fourth, only traces of the brick ?sana remain. 38</page><page sequence="9">A second row of twenty stone pillars, arranged in a square around the sanctum and images, marked out an open corridor around the shrine and probably supported a tile and timber roof. No evidence for the entrances to this corridor have been found. But it is clear that the design of the shrine allowed no access to the sanctum, which must have been vaulted over in brick.29 Superficially, at least, this shrine resembles cer tain square st?pas common in northwestern India and Afghanistan, where, in niches on each face, Buddhas seated in the dhy?na position were in stalled. But the Shrine of the Buddha of the Outer Circular Road is not a st?pa; its sanctum was not filled in, but was an enclosed space.30 We have no knowledge of what, if anything, was enshrined there. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is tempting to imagine that the sanctum con tained no relic but that its very emptiness sym bolized the unmanifest or void nature of the Dharma-k?ya. In relation to this, the Buddha shapes may be read as the manifest or phenomenal projections of the Dharma-k?ya throughout all the quarters of Space. At any rate, it is clear that the Shrine of the Buddha of the Outer Circular Road was an icon ographie machine intended to function like the Mandalagiri Wata-d?-ge with which it is roughly contemporary. And it affords additional evi dence that, in the eighth century, the idea which transformed the th?pa-ghara symbolism was en tertained by at least a faction of the Sangha in Ceylon. The monuments discussed above?the Wata d?-ge at Polonnaruva, its model at Medirigiriya, the Shrine of the Buddha of the Outer Circular Road, the Sat-mahal-p?s?da, the shrine buried within its core, and the Nak? Vih?ra?are, in fact, iconographie variations on a single icono logical theme. Taken individually, each appears unique?if not strange?in the artistic produc tion of Ceylon. But taken as a group (and it is natural to identify them, each with all, on the levels of meaning and usage), they form an im portant strand in the fabric of the art-history of ancient Ceylon. As for the Wata-d?-ge of Polon naruva, it must be understood to represent not only the late survival of a most ancient form of th?pa-ghara, but also a special mutation of that type, shaped in response to the needs and pres sures of cultural change.

I have also seen one or two examples among the caves at Kanheri. Of course, other circular temples are known in India, but it is not possible to identify them, with certainty, as th?pa-gharas. 3. The question of whether and how the circular th?pa ghara was roofed has bothered archaeologists from the moment of the re-discovery of these shrines in modern times. In fact, discussion of these monuments has centered primarily around the problem of the function of the stone pillars. The varying points of view are reviewed in S. Parana vitana, The St?pa in Ceylon {Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon, V, Colombo 1946), pp. 83-86. The evi dence suggests that the pillars supported some kind of roof. But the precise character of the roof is not clear. Presumably the smaller examples conformed to the type represented in the rock-cut examples in India, where a system of arched wooden ribs covered over with tiles or thatch closed in the top of the shrine. But the largest examples may not have been com pletely roofed over; in these, the central space would have been left open with a continuous roof covering the aisles around it. 4. E. M?ller, Ancient Inscriptions in Ceylon (London 1883), pp. 94-95, 117. 5. ASC, AR, 1903, p. 26 and ASC, AR, 1892, p. 1. 6. Mah?vamsa 78:41. Ordinarily, epigraphical evidence out weighs that of a literary account since it represents, ideally, contemporary opinion in a form not subject to subsequent editing and interpretation. But the chronicle ought to be valid here, if at all, for this portion of it was written down shortly after the death of Par?kramab?hu I and the accom plishments of his reign should have been clear in the memory of the chroniclers. And we must also take into account Nissamka Mallas campaign to build up his own prestige at the expense of his illustrious predecessor's reputation. 7. ASC, AR, 1903, p. 25. 8.

See ASC, AR, I960, pp. 77, 80; ASC, AR, 1961-62, pp. 64, 66 and plans I and II; ASC, AR, 1962-63, p. 66 and plate XVIII. 12. Paranavitana, St?pa, p. 93. 13. Ibid., p. 75, fig. 10. 14. At Rajangane, the terrace of the shrine itself is square. 15. A similar arrangement of stone "altars" appears among the remains at Manikdena. 16. Paranavitana, St?pa, p. 82. 17. This type would not be unlike the ?sana-ghara, recently identi fied as a special type of shrine. See ASC, AR, 1962-63, pp. 52, 53, 56-58 and plan III. 18. It may be worth mentioning that there is an ancient tradition in Ceylon which suggests that before the time when worship of the Buddha image was practised, homage was paid to the ?sana, a replica of the throne of enlightenment. The so-called "flower altars" of Tiriy?y and Manikdena may actually repre sent the adamantine seat and, by extension, the Enlightened One himself. In this way, they clearly demonstrate an inter mediate stage in the iconographie and historical evolution of the Wata-d?-ge. 19. See ASC, AR, 1907, pp. 31-32; ASC, AR, 1940-45, pp. 31-39. 20.

An early description of this shrine is given in ASC, AR, 1903, pp. 14-16. 26. ASC, AR, 1903, p. 15. 27. For the account of the excavation of this structure, see ASC, AR, 1911, PP. 40-41. 28. The name is adapted from the label given by an earlier gen eration of archaeologists to the famous stone Buddha of Anur?dhapura. In recent years, this sculpture has been re ferred to, sometimes, as the Sam?dhi statue. The shrine, of which the celebrated image was originally one component, was first noticed in ASC, AR, 1931-32, p. 8. Recent attempts to protect the surviving image through the construction of a shelter, have brought to light additional evidence. See ASC, AR, I960, pp. 66-69. The brickwork that remains and the style of the surviving image suggest a date early in the eighth century. 29. I do not agree with the opinion, recently expressed (see ASC, AR, I960, p. 67) that this shrine was originally a hodhi ghara and was therefore not roofed over its center. It is an interesting idea; but since the new excavations at the site failed to unearth even traces of an irrigation channel, it seems unlikely that the structure should have been meant to "house" a bodhi-tree. The issue, of course, may never be resolved, since the construction of a modern shelter has effec tively obscured the original remains of the shrine. 30. The inner faces of the enclosing wall were finished with painted plaster, traces of which have been found, and with a refined moulding along the base. 40</page></plain_text>
