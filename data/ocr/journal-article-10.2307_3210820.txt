The 2000 exca- vations continued to expose the monoapsidal basilican church, the chapel and other structures, all of which are components of a Byzantine (fifth-seventh centuries CE) monastic center and pilgrimage site dedicated to St. Aaron (preliminary reports on the excavations include Fr6sen etal. 1999; 2000). Excavations The excavations exposed the west-central area of the church. Originally a part of the nave in the early phase of use, it was subsequently transformed into an open, paved court. The southern half of the church's apse and the entire room flanking the apse on its southern side (south pastophorion2) were also excavated. Work in the apse revealed two well-preserved rows of the synthronon3 installation but the marble floor of the apse's interior was poorly preserved. Inside the pastophorion, a large, stone-built, tomb-like installation was poorly preserved. The use of this installation for storage seems plausible, at least during its later use. The excavations in the western area of the chapel exposed a well-preserved interior, including benches and the pilasters that supported arch springers. The substantial stone tumble inside^ i the structure contained many fragments of painted wall plaster j with geometric and floral designs ' ? . ... as well as some Greek letters and words. The sounding against the . western bench revealed the well- ' preserved remains of a masonry- constructed baptismal font of cruciform type, which probably t belongs to the earliest phase of ' - * occupation there. Probably, / * following the first destruction of ' . the church and the chapel, the 1 t '4 font was abandoned and K backfilled. The font resembles that discovered in the Petra church in 1996, and is the second baptismal installation known from southern Jordan. The excavations on the western side of the complex exposed well-preserved remains of a monumental structure forming a large, solid podium or high base supporting an unknown superstructure. The masonry type and construction material of this structure are unique at the site. This structure, probably Nabataean/Roman in date, was originally a component of either a large tower or a sacral building, but its function during the Byzantine phase of occupation at the site remains elusive. Farther east, a series of flagstone pavements were exposed as well as the remains of an arch. A large, multi-roomed structure located nearby NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 64/1-2 (2001) 65 I - - - -  '1%.

Survey and Mapping An intensive archaeological survey was conducted in the area southwest ofJabal Har'un, and on the northern and northeastern sides of the mountain, covering an area of about 1 km2. Thirty major sites were recorded in the southwestern quadrant, including more than two hundred barrages and terrace walls (in clusters of several struc- tures per site). These water management installations differ with regard to their location and function (slowing down runoff water or supporting fertile surface soil in small terrace fields). Six Middle and Late Palaeolithic sites, including quarries, ridge sites and microlithic sites, were recorded. Also, remains of an ancient road from Wadi 'Araba through Abu Khusheiba to Petra were documented together with several small building sites alongside the road. On the north- ern and northeastern side ofJabal Harun, six sites were recorded, including a dwelling site dating from the Nabataean through the Islamic periods. Water management is crucial to life in the Jabal HarOn area. The project survey discovered a number of barrages set across the main wadi, west of the site, that are features related to this activity.

The Project's cartographers continued activities to produce a three- dimensional computerized model of the entire Jabal Harun mountain and its environs, including the gathering of topographical and loca- tional information, digital photography and photogrammetry, and actual computer-generated modeling of the excavation site and the survey areas. The conservators continued consolidation and repair of walls, wall plaster, marble pavements and stone installations at the excavation site. Mosaic Further studies and conservation tests were conducted on the mosaic floor discovered during the 1999 campaign and located in the church's narthex. Originally, the mosaic featured an almost symmetrical arrange- ment of zoo- and anthropomorphic designs on both sides of the central door to the basilica, a colorful band of three intertwined bundles or chevrons, and some separate intricate geometric designs. The band, The northern part of the mosaic floor exposed in the narthex of the church. Photo by M. Mustonen. geometric designs and occasional fragments of human or animal bod- ies are the only figural motifs preserved since the mosaic was heavily altered by iconoclastic activities. The iconoclasts removed not only almost all faces but also main parts of human and animal bodies, and replaced them with plain large-size tesserae. However, while the replacement was generally well done, the removal was often incom- plete, thus the preserved details allow for an overall reconstruction. This kind of deliberate yet careful damage is generally dated to the eighth century (late Umayyad-earlyAbbasid period), and is known from other churches in Jordan and Palestine. The FJHP 2000 fieldwork season has provided a substantial amount of information concerning the site and its environs. The general phasing scheme, i.e., three major occupational phases of the basilica, as developed after the 1999 campaign, has largely been confirmed by the 2000 season's results. Also, it is increasingly apparent that the occupation at the monastic-pilgrimage site extended into the early eighth century, and probably later. Jaakko Frosen and ZbigniewT. Fiema University of Helsinki Notes IThe FJHP is directed byJaako Frosen and, during the third field season in the summer of 2000, included nearly thirty archaeologists, cartographers and students from Finland, Sweden, Italy, Jordan and the United States. The next fieldwork season is scheduled for late summer 2001. 2A room located on either side of the central apse in Byzantine monoapsidal churches. It usually functioned as a sacristy or a place for the storage of liturgical vestments, and for the preparation for ceremonies. 3A semicircular installation in the form of two to five steps built against the central apse in Byzantine churches. It served as a means to ascend the centrally situated bishop's throne, rather than to accommodate the clergy during the church services. References Frosen, J., Fiema, Z.
