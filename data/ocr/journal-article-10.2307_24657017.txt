<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal for the Study of Judaism, Vol. X, No. 2 THE VISIONS OF GOD IN APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE *) BY CHRISTOPHER ROWLAND University University of Newcastle upon Tyne In recent years apocalyptic has once again assumed a much more important position in the study of the origins of Christianity, and so much more attention is being devoted to the apocalyptic literature of Judaism. Nevertheless all too frequently the use of apocalyptic mate rial both from Jewish and Christian sources, especially in recent New Testament study, has tended to concentrate more on the eschatological elements of apocalyptic than to appreciate the apocalyptic phenome non in its entirety. Indeed, it is common to find apocalyptic being used as a reference to a particular brand of eschatology, which in eludes characteristic elements like the distinction between the two ages and the cataclysmic intervention of God in history 1). As a result we have reached the stage where the significance of apocalyptic is at times almost totally dominated by its eschatological element. But it hardly needs to be pointed out that the eschatological features form only one part of the literature which we refer to generally by the term apocalyptic. Indeed, if we examine the best known of the non-canoni cal apocalypses, 1 Enoch, we find that only a relatively small section of this extremely diverse work is concerned with specifically eschatolo gical themes. Much of what is contained in it can, however, with some considerable justification, be categorised as apocalyptic, for Enoch is frequently shown glimpses of things which are normally hidden from human perception, like the secrets of astronomy, the glories of the *)*) A paper delivered at the annual meeting of the British Association of Jewish Studies in Durham, July 19-20, 1976. x) E.g. E. Kasemann who defines apocalyptic in the following way: "... I speak of primitive Christian apocalyptic to denote the expectation of an imminent Parousia (On the Subject of Christian Apocalyptic'), ET, in New Testament Questions Questions of Today, London 1969, p. 109, η. 1. See also the criticisms of Kasemann by W. G. Rollins in 'The New Testament and Apocalyptic', NTS 17, pp. 458 ff. Recently W. Schmithals in his book The Apocalyptic Movement, ET, New York 1975, tends to concentrate on the historical element in apocalyptic at the expense of other features. See e.g. p. 31. 9*</page><page sequence="2">CHRISTOPHER ROWLAND 138 heavenly world, as well, of course, as the unveiling of the secrets of future history.Unfortunately concentration on this last mentioned sub ject has given a very one-sided view of the character of apocalyptic and its place within Jewish religion. Also it has blurred the extent of its relationship with movements like gnosticism with which it has been frequently contrasted 2). It seems to be the case that we are so used to thinking of apocalyptic in terms of the imminent winding up of the present world-order and the establishment of a new age that we miss the repeated emphasis in much apocalyptic literature on the revelation of things as they actually are in the heavenly world. Hence in certain parts of apocalyptic it is not so much the description of the last stages of the historical process which is to the fore but a mystical insight into another world and the perception of its secrets. Such elements point to apocalyptic being not merely a movement which was con cerned primarily with the future of the world but with the world above, its secrets and its glory. Appreciation of this particular feature of much apocalyptic will enable us to discern an essentially non eschatological character to parts of the apocalyptic corpus 3). The material examined in this article falls into this category. One question it poses is whether a rigid distinction can be main tained any longer between apocalyptic and the early rabbinic esoteric tradition 4). The possibility of some kind of connexion between cer 2) There is evidence that some sort of relationship exists between some gnostic texts and the early Jewish merkabah traditions. This is apparent in the ExcerptaExcerpta ex ex Theodoto (ed. R. P. Casey, London 1934) section 38, a link noted by G. Scho lem, Jewish Gnosticism, Alerkabah Mysticism and Talmudic Tradition"1■ (= Jewish Gnosticism),Gnosticism), New York 1965, p. 34. A link between gnosticism and merkabah mysticism has been suggested by others who have worked on the Nag Hammadi documents. See A. Bohlig "Der jiidische Hintergrund in gnostischen Texten von Nag Hammadi", in Mysterion und Wahrheit, Leiden 1968, p. 81 f.; R. A. Bullard, The The Hypostasis 0J the Archons, Berlin 1970, p. Ill; J. Doresse, The Secret Books 0J the the Egyptian Gnostics, ET, London 1960, pp. 285 ft.; G. Macrae, Elements 0J Judaism Judaism and Gnosticism, Diss. Cambridge 1966; and O. Hofius, Der Vorhang vor demdem Thron Gottes, Tubingen 1972. 3) This particular dimension of apocalyptic and later Jewish mystical writings has been especially relevant for the study of the Epistle to the Hebrews. See O. Hofius, op. cit., and earlier C. K. Barrett, "The Eschatology of the Epistle to the Hebrews" in ed. D. Daube and W. D. Davies, The Background 0J the New Testament Testament and its Eschatology, Cambridge 1956, especially pp. 374 ff. 4) On this link see especially G.

The material from rab binic sources concerning the macaseh merkabah, for example, is beset with problems because of the small amount of evidence available, and any contribution which could be made by study of the apocalyptic material would be important. The passages on the earliest rabbinic speculation on the merkabah by R. Johanan b. Zakkai and his circle are tantalisingly brief, and the information about R. Akiba and his contemporaries is even more difficult to evaluate. We cannot ascertain, for example, whether there was a fixed exposition of the biblical text of Ezekiel or whether a degree of freedom was permitted, to allow full rein to the speculation of the mystic 5). Any hope of shedding light on questions like these lies at present, at least for the earliest period, in the detailed study of parts of Jewish apocalyptic which deal with the subjects of special interest to the mystic, like the first chapters of Genesis and Ezekiel. That is not to suggest that we are in a position at the present time to say with any confidence anything about the kind of situation in which the visions of God, now preserved in the various apocalypses, were first formulated and handed down. At least we are able to compare the various visions of God and his heavenly court both with each other as well as with biblical examples and note if any changes and developments were taking place and thereby ascertain whether interest of a speculative kind goes back to an early period. Already in the first half of the second century BC Ezekiel's vision of God gave him a place in the list of Israel's heroes in Ecclesiasticus 49, 8. The Greek version simply records the fact that Ezekiel saw a vision of glory "which God showed to him on a chariot of cherubim". In the Hebrew, however, we read that "Ezekiel saw a vision and spoke about the various qualities of the chariot" (wjgd %ny mrkbh) e). Of much greater importance, however, is the earliest description of God's heavenly court outside the Bible which is also to be dated in 5) For a detailed analysis of the early rabbinic material see Ε.

In 1 Enoch 14, 8 ff. we have an extended account of Enoch's ascent into heaven and the revelation of the mysteries of the heavenly world. It occurs in the context of Enoch's mediation on behalf of the Watchers, who are seeking God's forgiveness for their many sins committed after their descent into the world. In the process of his mediatorial activity Enoch is taken up to heaven, and, besides receiving God's answer to the Watchers' plea for mercy, he is shown in some detail the glories of God's heavenly abode. There are clear indications that the description owes some of its ingredients to Ez. 1 and Is. 6. The reference to the wheel (14, 18) is perhaps the clearest evidence of the influence of Ezekiel, and the reference to the throne (ibid.) is almost identical to the LXX of Is. 6, 1. In the description of God there is continuation of the suggestive, if veiled, anthropomorphism of Ez. 1, 27 (14, 20), and the reference to God's garment is most probably derived from Is. 6, 1 8). Yet des pite the links with these biblical passages there are clear differences emerging in the vision of 1 Enoch 14. Unlike Ez. 1 there is no mention whatsoever of the living creatures which play such a prominent part in that chapter, (though cherubim are referred to briefly in vv. 11 and 18), and the concern of Ez. 1 with the movement of the chariot has vanished completely. Much attention is now devoted to the heavenly abode which Enoch enters, its walls, its roof as well as its inhabitants. It is a place which is divided into two parts (vv. 10 and 15), a division which has suggested to some that a strong priestly influence has been at work on this particular vision, because of the division of the main part of the Temple into two sections 9). But apart from the fact that God's dwelling consists of two parts, there is hardly enough simi י) So Scholem, Major Trends, p. 44 and K. Schubert, Die Religion des nach biblischenbiblischenbiblischen Judentums, Freiburg 1955, p. 89. L. Rost, Einleitung in alttestamentlischen ApokryphenApokryphen und Psendepigraphen, Heidelberg 1971, p. 104, thinks it dates from the first half of the second century BC. Precise dating of this passage depends to a large extent on its relationship with Dan. 7, with which it shares several elements in common, see Η. H. Rowley, The Relevance of Apocalyptic1■, London 1947, pp. 77 ff., and J. Emerton, "The Origin of the Son of Man Imagery", JTS 9, pp. 225 ff. and now Glasson in NTS 23. 8) The garment of God played a part in later Jewish mystical speculation, see Scholem,Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, pp. 56 ff. and R. Loewe, "The Divine Garment and the Shicur Qomah', HTR 58. 9) See especially Maier, Kultus, p. 127 and id., Gefahrdungsmotiv, pp. 18 ff. There are several differences between 1 Enoch 14 and the arrangement of the Temple. For example, the cherubim seem to be in a different part of the heavenly palace from God. Enoch sees them early on in his vision (14, 11).</page><page sequence="5">THE VISIONS OF GOD IN APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE 141 larity in detail to justify any but the assumption that the basic outline of the Temple would have been taken by many apocalypticists as a reflection of the court of God in heaven. Returning briefly to the question of the relationship with Ez. 1, perhaps the major difference which we notice when comparing 1 Enoch 14 and Ez. 1, (and one which is a feature of two of the other texts which we shall be exam ining), is the fact that now Enoch has to undertake an ascent into heaven before he can gaze upon the glories surrounding God. Moving on to a consideration of some aspects of the vision itself, we need to consider the following points. First of all we should note the brief description which is given of the way in which the heavenly world affected Enoch 10). In v. 13 he speaks of entering that house "which was as hot as fire and as cold as snow". This is a strangely superfluous remark, especially when we consider that the vision itself is apparently merely part of a much larger story dealing with Enoch's mediatorial activity. A similar comment relating to the experience of the visionary as he enters heaven appears in the Apocalypse of Abra ham 17, where the patriarch describes his loss of balance as he ap proached God. The second point to note is the contrast between the description of God himself (the Great Glory) in 14, 20 with the restrained description of the figure on the throne in Ez. 1, 27. The qualifying nouns ?nr'"h and dmwt of Ez. 1, 26 are dropped, and, despite the fact that Enoch is said to be prostrate at the time, he manages to give a brief description of God, which, like similar passages in Dan. 7, 9 and 1 Enoch 71, 10, includes mention of his clothing. In addition, 14, 21 clearly indicates that God resembled human form despite the fact that the angels were unable to look upon him. In the later Slavonic Enoch the description of God is much more explicit than 1 Enoch 14, 20, and we see a movement here towards the extravagance of the later shiiurshiiur qomah speculations. In this work we find that when Enoch re turns to his sons he speaks in the following way about the glory of God: 10) In later Christian mysticism the mystic sometimes comments on a sensation of heat, e.g. St. Philip Neri according to M. Trevor, Apostle of Rome, London 1966, p. 40 f.: "When Philip was intensely absorbed in prayer, he was subject to a trembling or shaking so powerful that it shook the bed he was sitting or lying on" ... "he could not control another effect of prayer, which was a sensation of heat, often excessive, in the chest and associated with the heart". Cf. Catherine of Genoa's experience mentioned in F. von Hugel, The Mystical Element in Re ligion2, London 1923, vol. i, p. 178.</page><page sequence="6">CHRISTOPHER rowland 142 Vous, mes enfants, vous voyez mon visage a moi, homme cree semblable a vous, moi j'ai vu le visage du Seigneur comme un fer chauffe au feu, jetant des etincelles. Car vous, vous regardez les yeux d'un homme cree egal a vous, moi j'ai regarde les yeux du Seigneur comme les rayons du soleil qui luit, terrifiant les yeux de !'homme. Vous, mes enfants, vous voyez qui vous fait signe ma droite a moi, homme fait pareil a vous, moi j'ai vu qui me faisait signe la droite du Seigneur, emplissant le ciel. Vous, vous voyez l'etendue de mon corps semblable au votre, moi j'ai vu l'etendue du Seigneur sans mesure et sans comparaison, qui n'a pas de fin 11). This catalogue of details about God's person is clearly an advance on any of the early material and contrasts markedly with tendencies which we shall have reason to note later in other apocalyptic visions of God. Another development as compared with Ez. 1, and one which be comes a distinctive feature of several of the apocalyptic visions of God is the inclusion of the rivers of fire (14, 19) which flow from under God's throne 12). The origin of this imagery is by no means clear, but probably passages like Ez. 1, 13, Ez. 47, 1, Ex. 19, 16 and Zee. 14, 18 have contributed to the origin of this particular element, which is to be found also in the theophany in Dan. 7, 10 ("The throne was fiery flames, its wheels were burning fire. A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him"). So it is apparent that in one of the earliest pieces of extra-canonical evidence of the vision of God there is no mere repetition of the scriptural exemplars, but there is definite development of interest in certain subjects which were only mentioned briefly in the biblical visions as well as the inclusion of elements which did not feature at all in them. In this it is probably justifiable to consider the possibility very carefully of the beginnings of a speculative interest in passages like Ez. 1, even at this early stage. Among the texts discovered in Cave 4 at Qumran there is a brief and fragmentary description of the divine throne-chariot and its angel ic attendants, dated by J. Strugnell, who first published it, in the first half of the first century BC 13). In it there is even clearer evidence ״) From A. Vaillant's Le Livre des Secrets d'Henoch, Paris 1952, chapter 13, p. 37, noted now by Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism-, p. 130. On the shi'ur qomah speculation see Scholem, Alajor Trends, pp. 63 ff. 12) On this feature of Jewish uranology see further H. Bietenhard, Die himm lischelische Welt im Urchristentum imd Spatjudentum, Tubingen 1951, p. 75. 13) "The Angelic Liturgy at Qumran", Supplements to X'etus Testamentum vii, p. 335 if. References to the merkabah fragment follow the lines of the Hebrew text.</page><page sequence="7">THE VISIONS OF GOD IN apocalyptic literature 143 than there was in 1 Enoch 14 of the influence of Ez. 1. The reference to the chariot, its wheels, the firmament, the comparison of the rivers of fire to hsml and the frequent use of the noun mr^h all indicate indebtedness to Ez. 1 14). Indeed, some of the dominant interests of that chapter reappear, one example being the movement of the chariot and its wheels (line 3, cf. Ez. 1, 17). The cultic influence which made only a superficial impression on 1 Enoch 14 is much more prominent in this brief passage. If we accept Strugnell's reconstruction of the first line of the text, (and one has to admit that some of the readings are very conjectural), it would appear that the events described take place in the heavenly tabernacle. The cherubim feature more pro minently here than in 1 Enoch 14, where they are mentioned in passing but not linked at all closely with God's immediate presence. According to line 2 of the Qumran fragment, however, the cherubim are in close proximity to God's throne (cf. 1 Kings 6.23), as, unlike Ez. 1, 22 and 10, 1, where the firmament is above their heads, the cherubim are placed near the throne-chariot above the firmament 15). Also the reference to the throne-chariot itself in line 2 is probably influenced by the description of the cherubim-chariot in the Temple mentioned in 1 Chron. 28,18. We may compare 1 Chron. tbnyt hmrkbh hknvbjmhknvbjm with the Qumran fragment's tbnyt ksג mrkbh. Nevertheless, while there is clear influence from Ez. 1 this passage too too shows traces of independent ideas. For example, we find that once again the rivers of fire feature in the theophany (line 4), and, as we have already noted, the description of them uses the word hsml. This is suggested either by Ez. 1, 27, where it is used to describe the glory of the human figure seated upon the throne, or, more likely, by Ez. 1, 4 where it portrays the brightness of the fire flashing from the cloud. What is most noticeable about the fragments of this work which are now extant is that there is no trace whatsoever of the veiled anthro pomorphism of Ez. 1 and the fractionally more explicit descriptions of God's form in 1 Enoch 14 and Dan. 7, 9. Even though we are not 14) The use of rqmh (line 5), though derived from Judges 5, 30, may betray the influence of Ez. 1, 27. It may well have been inspired by the reference there to the rainbow which is not mentioned in the extant fragments of our text. 15) Strugnell, op. cit.y p. 337 rightly translates "the structure of the chariot throne do the cherubim bless from above the firmament", cf. G Vermes, The Dead Dead Sea Scrolls in English, Harmondsworth 1962: "the cherubim bless the image of the throne-chariot above the firmament" ... In a passage like Slavonic Enoch 8 (Vaillant's ed.) we find that the cherubim are situated in the sixth heaven, whereas God is in the seventh.</page><page sequence="8">christopher rowland 144 in a position to be certain about the significance of this omission, it is worthy of note that the reference to the throne is not immediately followed by the description of the figure upon it, unlike the parallel passages in 1 Enoch 14 and Rev. 4, both of which follow Ez. 1, 26 in mentioning a figure on the throne. In later descriptions of God's heavenly court we find that the va rious parts of the throne-chariot have achieved the status of angelic beings. This is most obvious in Hebrew or 3 Enoch where the ophan nimnim have become an angelic band but is also apparent in the earlier vision of God contained in 1 Enoch 71, 7 ("And round about were cherubin, seraphin, and ophannin and these are they who sleep not and guard the throne of his glory"). In line 3 it is quite clear that there is a definite parallelism between the movement of the wheels and that of the angels 16). The fact that this can already be found in Ez. 1, 19 and 10, 16, where there is parallelism between the movement of the creatures and the wheels, might indicate nothing more than a borrow ing from that source. The possibility that the ophannim have become more than merely part of the chariot becomes more likely when we compare the wording of line 3 ("And as the wheels move the most holy angels return") with Ez. 1, 19 ("And when the living creatures move, the wheels move beside them"). In comparison with the pas sage from Ez. the ophannim in the Qumran fragment have taken the place of the living creatures in the first part of the sentence, and it is not, therefore, impossible that in the mind of the author of this text they cease to be merely parts of the chariot and now participate as a class of heavenly beings in their own right in the drama of the heavenly worship. Two other features which appear in later mystical material and which are to be found also in this text should be noted. The first is the use of words like dgl and mhnh to describe the groups of angels around God in lines 7 and 8. In a work like 3 Enoch we read that "506,000 myriads of camps (mhnwt) has the Holy One" (35,1) and "all the angels and divisions (dglym) tremble with pain as they prepare to sing the qedushah" (19, 6). Secondly we should note that of the two occurrences of the word mrkbh one of these is to be found in a plural form (line 5). In Strugnell's opinion this expression is certainly 1β) Strugnell, op. cit., p. 339 f. is less enthusiastic about the possibility that the wheels of the chariot mentioned in this passage have become an angelic band' but he does concede that they "may be on their way to be coming more than merely parts of the chariot".</page><page sequence="9">THE VISIONS OF GOD IN APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE 145 singular in meaning as it "is nothing more than an elative expression, the plural of majesty" 17). Admittedly we do have the singular form used in the first reference in line 2, but it is not absolutely necessary to suppose that this is a reference to the same chariot already men tioned, especially as the multiplicity of divine throne-chariots is a theme which is dwelt upon in some later texts. In 3 Enoch 24, for example, we find a series of scriptural passages intended to show that God had many chariots, and in the Visions of Ezekiel we read that "R. Meir said that the Holy One created seven heavens, and there are seven chariots in them" 18). This is almost exactly the same kind of cosmology as the Jewish-Christian Ascension of Isaiah which speaks of a series of seven heavens, in the lowest five of which thrones are placed. If we accept Strugnell's view with regard to the significance of this plural form, it will not be possible to read anything more de veloped into the text, but it is a point which does deserve consider ation especially as far as the later mystical material is concerned 19). This brief consideration of an important text suggests yet again but an increase in detail about the nature of God and his throne without any slavish dependence on the scriptural exemplars. The source of the imagery is never in doubt, but the use made of it indicates a clear willingness to develop views about the heavenly world in a highly idiosyncratic fashion. In the New Testament the best־ example of a vision of God and his heavenly court is to be found in Rev. 4. This chapter itself shows no evidence whatsoever of Christian influence, and, treated in isolation, it is quite clear that it is entirely Jewish in its inspiration. Indeed, the author obviously intends a deliberate contrast between the description of the divine court in Rev. 4 and the transformation which takes place as the result of the exaltation of the slaughtered lamb. This creature is then permitted to open the heavenly scroll, an act which ushers in the eschaton. In Rev. 4 there are obvious omissions as compared with Ez. 1. Thus, for example, there is no mention made of the wheels of the chariot, but the links with that chapter are never in doubt with the inclusion of the rainbow as well as a detailed description of the living creatures 17) Op. cit., p. 328, n. 4; cf. Maier, Kultus, p. 135 and Gefahrdimgsmotiv, pp. 23 ff. 18) From S. Wertheimer, bty mdrswt, Jerusalem 1955, vol. ii, p. 130. 19) Cf. Wisdom of Solomon 9, 4: "Give me wisdom who sits beside your thrones" (δός μοι την των σων θρόνων πάρεδρον σοφίαν) and a Hekaloth text (MS Oxford 1531) 56a (bottom): wH hmrkbwt c%k tthdr.</page><page sequence="10">CHRISTOPHER ROWLAND 146 which owes much to Ez. 1 but contains some differences 20).Firstly it will be noticed that each living creature has been identified with one of the four faces of the creatures of Ez. (4, 7). The description, therefore, is considerably simplified by having four different creatures in Rev. each with one face as compared with Ez. where, of course, there are four creatures each having four different faces. Secondly, in Ez. 1,18 it is the rims of the wheels of the chariot which are full of eyes, but this particular feature is now transferred to the creatures themselves, a transference which can also be seen in the description of the angel KerubielKerubiel in 3 Enoch 22, 8 (cf. Rev. 5, 6). Thirdly, the order in which the creatures are mentioned in Rev. differs from Ez. 1, (Rev.: lion, ox, man and eagle; Ez.: man, lion, ox and eagle). Having noted the indebtedness of Rev. 4 to Ez. 1 (and, it should be noted, to Is. 6 in 4, 8) let us move on to consider some of the details of the vision itself. As with Enoch, John of Patmos finds himself taken up to heaven 21), and the first thing which he notices there is a throne, mentioned without any attempt to describe it further 22). As in the Qumran fragment there is no explicit description of the figure on the throne, but the one seated upon it is said to resemble "jasper and carnelian", words which occur in successive lines in Ez. 28, 13 in the description of the Urmensch. The fact that this verse seems to have influenced the imprecise description of the one sitting on the throne suggest that the lack of anthropomorphic terminology is only super ficial, and the use of these two words betrays the author's acceptance of the anthropomorphism of Ez. 1, 26 f., even though it is subtly disguised by the imagery borrowed from Ez. 28, 13. Mention of a rainbow (4,3) is obviously influenced by Ez. 1,28 though its resemblance to an emerald may once again indicate the influence 20) For a detailed study of the creatures in Revelation see J. Michl, Die Engel vorstellungenvorstellungen in der Apokalypse des hi. Johannes, Miinchen 1937, pp. 5 ff. 21) NEB is probably right to paraphrase έγενόμην έν πνεύματι as "At once I was caught up by the Spirit', see R. H. Charles, Revelation, Edinburgh 1926, vol. i, p. Ill and cf. the fragment of the Apocalypse of Zephaniah preserved in Clement of Alexandria Stromateis v, 21 (A. M. Denis, Fragmenta Pseudepigraphorum quae quae supersunt Graece, Leiden 1970, p. 129): και άνέλαβέν με πνεϋμα και άνήνεγκέν με εις ούρανύν πέμπτον . On the door in heaven cf. T. Levi 5, 1 (and the material cited by Charles, op. tit., vol. i, p. 107) and note the significant parallel in ed. A. Dietrich, Eine Mithrasliturgie, Leipzig 1903: είτα άνοιξον οφθαλμούς καί οψει άνεωγυίας τάς θύρας και τον κόσμον των θεών. 22) This is typical of most of the early texts, e.g. Ez. 1, 26 dmwt ksDan. 7, 9 krswivnkrswivn rmyiv; 4Q SI tbnyt ksנ־ mrkbh\ the Apocalypse of Abraham 18: "over the wheels was a throne . . . this was covered with fire". The only possible exception is 1 Enoch 14: θρόνον ύψηλον και το είδος αύτοϋ ώσει κρυστάλλινον,</page><page sequence="11">THE VISIONS OF GOD IN APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE 147 of of Ez. 28,13. This possibility, together with the fact that the rainbowis here very closely linked with the throne itself, is probably an indication that, as far as John was concerned, the concluding words of Ez. 1 ("Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about") applied not to the chapter as a whole, but specifically to the description of the throne and the figure on it with which it finishes. In God's immediate pres ence there are other thrones (4,4), as in the Ascension of Isaiah 9,9, where, in the seventh heaven, the righteous are clad in garments of glory and have thrones and crowns. The origin of the number of the elders, a peculiar feature of Rev., is not clear, but many have suggested with some plausibility, that it is derived from the twenty-four priestly orders of 1 Chron.. 24, 7-18. In the light of the cultic influence which we have noted in other visions this explanation seems to be the most likely 23). Of course, the surrounding of God with his heavenly retinue is a familiar one from the Bible, e.g. Job 1-2 and Ps. 82, 1. From God's throne proceed lightnings, voices and thunderings, but there is no mention of the stream of fire which we noticed in the first two texts which we examined. Nevertheless Rev. probably does reflect this particular feature of the tradition, because we find that in Rev. 22, 1 "a river of living water as clear as crystal" comes out of God's throne. Despite the pastoral setting in Paradise there is little doubt that, whatever the influence from Ez. 47, 1 and Zee. 14, 8, the river is to be connected with the fiery sream because of the very close links with the throne of God. The seven lamps (4, 5) go back to Ez. 1, 13 (cf. Ex. 26, 35) where the burning fires in the middle of the living creatures are compared to torches (cf. 2 Chron. 4, 7), though influence from Zee. 4, 2 is cer tain also, not least because the interpretation of the seven lamps as the seven spirits of God resembles the pattern of Zee. 4, 2 and 10, where the seven lamps too are interpreted in this case as being sym bolic of the seven eyes of the Lord. It is worth noting also that in 3 Enoch 15, 2 the angel Metatron is said to have on his right hand "divisions of fiery flames" and on his left hand "fire-brands were burning". Perhaps the most distinctive feature about the vision of God in Rev. 4 is the reference to the sea of glass (4, 6). Unlike the Testament of Levi 2, 7 ("And I entered from the first heaven and saw a huge sea 23) See the discussion in Charles, op. tit., i, pp. 128 ff. and Bietenhard, op. tit., p. 57 f.</page><page sequence="12">CHRISTOPHER ROWLAND 148 hanging there"), 2 Enoch 3, 3 ("They placed me on the first heaven and showed me a very great sea, greater than the earthly sea") and the Testament of Abraham Recension Β 8 ("And Michael went out and took Abraham in the body on a cloud and lifted him up to the river Ocean"), in all of which water is said to be in heaven, Rev. merely indicates that in the immediate vicinity of God's presence there was something which appeared to resemble a sea. The influence of cultic ideas is not to be ruled out, for we know that in Solomon's temple a molten sea was to be found (1 Kings 7, 23 cf. Josephus Antiquities viii, 79). The more likely origin, however, is probably Ez. 1, 22 where the firmament which separates the creatures from God is likened to crystal, as is the sea in Rev. 4, 6. In addition we should not omit to mention Gen. 1, 7 which speaks of the upper and lower waters in heaven which are separated by a firmament. Indeed the link between the water and the firmament here could explain the resemblance of the sea in Rev. 4 to crystal, for the juxtaposition of water and the firma ment in Gen. could easily have led to the comparison of the firmament to crystal found in Ez. 1, 22. We know that Gen. 1, 7 played its part in the early rabbinic medita tion on creation (ma^aseh bereshith), for we read of Simeon b. Zoma gazing upon the space between the upper and lower waters (Tosefta Hagigah 2, 5 and parallels in b. Hagigah 15a, j. Hagigah 77b and Bereshith R. 2, 4) 24). Some traces of this kind of interest can still probably be found in Rev. and may be another indication of the im portance of apocalyptic literature for the study of the beginnings of Jewish mysticism. The reference to something which appeared to be a sea of glass appears again in Rev. 15,2. This time it is said to bemin gled with fire, and from the context it is clear that it is compared to the Red Sea over which Israel crossed in triumph and was delivered from the hand of Pharaoh. Its fiery appearance presents a threatening 24) It is striking that the conclusion of Ben Zoma's speculation about the extent of the gap between the waters is similar to the width of the molten sea in Solo mon's temple. Cf. 1 Kings 7, 26: "Its thickness was a handbreadth", and b. Hagigah 15a: "there is only a bare three fingers" (breadth) between them (sis ־'sb'-wt־'sb'-wt blbd). The influence of Gen. 1, 7 is also discernible in Cenez's vision in Pseudo-Philo's lather Antiquitatum Biblicarum 28 (ed. G. Kisch, Notre Dame, Indiana 1949, p. 149): "Et dum factum esset fundamentum, vidi de vena ilia excitabatur quasi spuma ebulliens, et ecce demutavit se quasi in aliud fundamen turn. Inter medium autem fundamentum superioris et inferioris, de lumine in visibili advenerunt quasi imagines hominum, et perambulabant". See also J. M. Ford, Revelation, New York 1975, p. 73 f.</page><page sequence="13">THE VISIONS OF GOD IN APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE 149 aspect to the enemies of God who would wish to cross over it 25).Those who have remained faithful to God, however, are permitted to cross over the sea and gain access to God's presence. After crossing they sing a song of deliverance just as the Israel of old had done (Rev. 15, 3; cf. Ex. 15, 1). The significance of this particular reference to the sea, which offers a threatening aspect to those who would draw near God, can be illustrated by a famous passage which occurs in later rabbinic mystical texts. In it problems confront the mystic in his ascent to heaven when he may be confronted with something which may appear to be water in heaven but is in fact something quite different. In the longest version of the story of the four who entered pardes, in b. Hagigah 14b, Akiba warns his companions about a particular haz ard when they come to the place of the pure marble plates, at which point they may be tempted to cry "Water, water". He tells them not to be deceived by such an experience, because such a case of mistaken identity will not be tolerated in heaven 26). The inclusion of the sea of glass with its threatening aspect in Rev. 15 may well be an earlier recollection of a danger facing visionaries as they seek to identify the different contents of the heavenly world. The threat in this case does not manifest itself against those who have a mistaken view of heaven so much as against those who lack faithfulness at times of persecution Ο52־)· Compared with the first two texts which we examined the extent to which the description of God and his court in Rev. 4 moves away from the two most important biblical exemplars is nothing like as great. Yet here again we do not find mere repetition of biblical phrase 25) Charles, op. tit., ii, p. 33 and H. Kraft, Die Offenbarung des Johannes, Tubingen 1974, p. 201. 26) Shorter versions of this story without any reference to this particular inci dent are to be found in Tos. Hagigah 2, 3, j. Hagigah 77b and Shir ha-Shirim R. 1, 4, see further Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, pp. 14 ff.; Maier, Gefahrdungsmotiv, pp. 28 ff.; and Strack-Billerbeck, Kommentar %ur NT ans Talmttd und Midrasch, vol. iii, p. 798 f. A similar case of mistaken identity to that in the story in BT is to be found in the story of the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon in the Quran, Sura 27, 44 (noted also by W. Bousset, Die Offenbarung Johannis6, Got tingen 1906, pp. 248 f.): "Her false gods have led her astray because she comes from an unbelieving nation. She was bidden to enter the palace, and when she saw it, she thought it was a pool of water and bared her legs. But Solomon said, "It is a palace paved with glass". "Lord", she said, "I have sinned against my own soul. Now I submit with Solomon to Allah, Lord of all creation". The queen is here deceived by the appearance of Solomon's palace into thinking that some of it consists of water. This looks like a garbled version of a story which originally referred to the Temple where there was an object which was called a sea but which was in fact made of metal.</page><page sequence="14">CHRISTOPHER ROWLAND 150 ology but the introduction of new ideas together with the omission of features which were more prominent in the originals. What is especially noteworthy about Rev. 4, certainly as compared with the Qumran fragment, is that Is. 6 has a much more prominent role to play and is freely combined with Ez. 1 (4, 8). Once again it is worth pointing out that this very brief passage with its distinctive features is incidental to the overriding purpose of the work as a whole, which is a message of hope and a warning to the churches in Asia Minor. When the communication of details about God and his heavenly court is not the purpose of the wider context in which the vision of God is placed, the differences and developments have greater significance than would have been the case if the overall purpose of the work was the revelation of heavenly secrets. The last example of a vision of God from apocalyptic literature is taken from the Apocalypse of Abraham 17-19, a work which is diffi cult to date with certainty but probably comes from the end of the first century AD 27). What small traces there are of Christian influence in this work (chapter 29) are not to be found in the section which directly concerns us. After preparing his sacrifice Abraham is taken up to the seventh heaven by means of the birds which are part of his offering 28). After his arrival in heaven Abraham sings the celestial song and is shown the throne of God, its environs and is given a glimpse into the future. The description of God's throne stands even closer to Ez. 1 than the three passages considered so far, with several parallels, e.g. the sound of many waters (17, 1; cf. Ez. 1, 24) 29), the living creatures (18, 3) and the chariot and its wheels (18, 11). As in Ez. 1 each of the four creatures is said to have four heads (faces in Ez.), and like that chapter the wheels are said to be full of eyes (18, 11 cf. Ez. 1, 18). This is a detail which is often omitted from descriptions of the throne-chariot, or, as in Rev. 4, transferred to the living creatures. The influence of Is. 6 which we noticed in both 1 Enoch 14 and Rev. 4 is clearly discernible in 18, 6 where Is. 6 is once again combined with Ez. 1 in 27) See Denis, Introduction aux pseudepigraphes grecs d'AT, Leiden 1970, p. 37; G. H. Box, The Apocalypse of Abraham, London 1918. 28) From other sources we know that it was thought that God had given Abraham a vision of the future on this particular occasion, see Fragment Targum on Gen, 15, 17 and Targum Jonathan on Is. 43, 12. 29) Verse references are according to the the translation in P. Riessler, Alt judisches Schriftum aitsserhalb der Bibel2, Heidelberg 1966.</page><page sequence="15">151 THE VISIONS OF GOD IN APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE the description of the wings of the creatures 30), but the passage is not without its distinctive features. One of the most unusual of these is the way in which the creatures threaten each other and the necessity for the angel who accompanies Abraham to go and prevent an attack of the creatures on each other (18, 8 f.). The threatening appearance of the creatures appears in 3 Enoch 1: "As soon as the princes of the merkabab and the flaming seraphim perceived me, they fixed their eyes upon me ... I fell down and was benumbed by the radiant image of their eyes and the splendid ap pearance of their faces." In this passage the creatures show their hostility against any intruder into God's dwelling. Also in 3 Enoch 20 we find a reference to an angel (Hayjiel) who is set over the living creatures, and, like Jaoel, has the responsibility of directing their praise towards God. In the Apocalypse of Abraham Jaoel turns the heads of the creatures away from each other (18, 9) and teaches them the song of peace. In 3 Enoch the angel smites the creatures with lashes of fire but glorifies them when they give praise to God. As far as the character of God himself is concerned, the trend which we noted in the Qumran fragment and Rev. is taken even further here, for, unlike Ez. 1, no mention is made whatsoever of any human form sitting on the throne of glory. The omission must be considered a point of some significance 31), not least in the light of the extensive dependence on Ez. 1 which is found throughout this section. All that the patriarch speaks of above the throne is "the power of invisible glory" (19, 5). Abraham stresses that he saw no other being there apart from the angels 32). There is no doubt that God's presence is 30) The problems of the relationship between Is. 6 and Ez. 1 are discussed in b. Hag. 13a: "One verse says, Each one had six wings and another verse says, And everyone of them had four faces and everyone of them had four wings. There is no contradiction; the one refers to the time when the Temple was no longer standing, as it were the wings of the living creatures were diminished . . . Raba said, All that Ezekiel saw, Isaiah saw. What does Ezekiel resemble? A villager who saw a king. And what does Isaiah resemble? A townsman who saw a king". (Translation from the Soncino version). 31) One wonders if the stress on the emptiness of heaven is polemic against those whose view of God was too anthropomorphic, cf. A. Marmorstein, The Old Rabbinic Rabbinic Doctrine of God, Oxford 1927, vol. ii, pp. 48 ff. The invisibility of God is stressed in passages like Ex. 33, 20, Jn. 1, 18 and Col. 1, 15, cf. the Apocalypse of Zephaniah (see n. 21), where the angels praise the θεόν άρρητον. 32) Another sign of the tendency towards spiritualisation in the Apocalypse of Abraham is that the angels in the sixth firmament are said to be "without bodies and of a pure spirit".</page><page sequence="16">CHRISTOPHER ROWLAND 152 located within the most holy part of heaven above the throne-chariot itself, but every trace of anthropomorphism has been removed. There is not even the hint of it which we found in Rev. 4. This characteristic may have been the result of cultic influence, for in the Holy of Holies there was, of course, no physical representation of the deity 33), but one should not exclude the possibility that a deliberate attempt was made to exclude the anthropomorphism which plays a significant part in Ez. 1, 26 f. and other later reworkings of that chapter. After his ascent to heaven Abraham is taught to sing the celestial hymn of praise to God (17, 7 if.). It is a hymn which Scholem con siders to be a text "that more closely resembles a tnerkabah text than any other in Jewish apocalyptic" 34). As he points out, hymns like this one played an important part in the preparation of the mystic to behold the glories of the merkabah, as well as being part of the songs which were sung in honour of God by the heavenly host 35). A cur sory glance at some of the hekaloth texts shows how frequent these hymnic passages are. Like the hymn in the Apocalypse of Abraham and the short hymnic passages which occur throughout the book of Revelation (e.g. 4, 8 and 11) they include an extensive recital of the attributes of God and his merkabah 36). Although in the Apocalypse of Abraham the recital of the hymn does not seem to be a necessary prelude to acceptance into the divine presence, it may be no coinci dence that we are told that Abraham learnt to recite it before he came into the presence of God 37). After this survey of some visions of God in the apocalyptic literature what points can be made in conclusion? (i) The diversity in the usage of the first chapter of Ezekiel suggests that within the apocalyptic tradition there was an interest in this chapter for its own sake, and, despite the present context of the visions 33) Cf. Josephus' description of the Holy of Holies in BJ v, 219: "The inner most recess . . . was screened in like manner from the outer portion by a veil. In this stood nothing whatever; unapproachable, inviolable, invisible to all, it was called the Holy of Holies". 34) Jeivish Gnosticism, p. 23. There seem to be indications that Job's daughters may have been uttering such heavenly hymns at the departure of their father according to the Testament of Job 48 (ed. S. P. Brock, Leiden 1967). 35) See the examples of this material in Hekaloth Zutarti (MS Oxford 1531) and HekalothHekaloth Rabbati 24 in A. Jellinek, Beth ba-Midrasch, Jerusalem 1967, vol. iii p. 100. 36) On the hymnic passages in Rev. see R. Deichgraber, Gotteshymnus und ChristushymnusChristushymnus in der friihen Christenbeit, Gottingen 1967, pp. 44 if. 37) Participation in the heavenly worship precedes Isaiah's description of the descent of the Redeemer in Ascension of Isaiah 9, 27 ff.</page><page sequence="17">THE VISIONS OF GOD IN APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE 153 the very variety is an indication that the vision was more than merely a a back-drop to the more important revelation of eschatological mys teries. The differences which emerge between the various texts them selves as well as compared with the biblical exemplars point to a continuing speculative interest rather than a strictly ordered and well defined exposition 38). The way in which other biblical imagery mer ges into the production of the various visions may all point to a setting in which a free meditation took place on the chariot-chapter, so that, as in Rev., the visionary's own experience could make an important contribution to the "seeing again" of Ezekiel's vision. (ii) We cannot assume that, because cultic influence can be so fre quently detected, the visions must have arisen within priestly circles. The degree of influence of cultic language varies between the different works, and some influence from this particular area is inevitable because the Temple was the place where, above all others, God's presence dwelt, and the characteristics of that building would inevi tably colour the descriptions of heaven. (iii) In the first three works which we have considered there was little trace of the developed cosmology of, for example, b. Hagigah 12b and the Ascension of Isaiah. This type of cosmology is apparent, however, in the Apocalypse of Abraham, almost certainly the latest work which we have examined. Nevertheless there were already clear traces in 1 Enoch of a tendency to separate heaven into different parts through which Enoch has to journey before he can finally reach God's presence. It is hardly surprising, therefore, to find, as cosmological speculation developed, that there was the need of a heavenly ascent before the visionary could gaze upon God's throne. (iv) We have noted a tendency in our examination of the various passages to move away from anthropomorphic conceptions to the position in the Apocalypse of Abraham (and in all likelihood the Qumran fragment) where there is no suggestion whatsoever that a figure was seated upon the throne of glory. Alongside this develop ment there is an interesting phenomenon emerging in the last two works examined. The reluctance to use anthropomorphic terminology is matched by the development of an interest in an exalted angelic figure with divine attributes, who is, of course, given the form of a man. In the Apocalypse of Abraham we find that the angel Jaoel is 38) A set pattern of exposition of the merkabah-chapter seems to be presupposed by b. Hagigah 13 a (and by the words snh ly prq 'hd bmcsh mrkbh in Hag. 14b), where exposition seems to be divided up into fixed sections following the order of the biblical text.</page><page sequence="18">CHRISTOPHER ROWLAND 154 said to have God's name dwelling in him, and in Rev. 1, 13 ff. the description of the glorified Christ derives in part from the description of the angel who appears to Daniel in Dan. 10, 6, but he is also given attributes of God himself derived from Dan. 7, 9. Thus it would appear that the interest in God's form on the throne of glory which plays a small, but significant, role in Ez. 1 and 1 Enoch 14 is now fulfilled, to some extent at least, by the reference to a glorious angelic being endowed with divine attributes. (v) The appearance of certain merkabah traditions in the recently published gnostic texts from Nag Hammadi suggests that parts, at least, of the apocalyptic tradition may have had a role in the formation of gnostic religion 39). The tendency to separate apocalyptic and gnosticism as different kinds of spirituality must be questioned. (vi) Apocalyptic must be recognised as an important, indeed in valuable, source for the reconstruction of the origins of Jewish mys ticism, even if at present we are not in a position to ascertain whether it is the parent of the kind of meditation which was practised among the rabbis and, for that matter, the predecessors of the rabbis who flourished before the fall of Jerusalem 40). Whatever its precise back ground this material from the apocalyptic literature offers us a much needed means of ascertaining the character of the earliest meditation on Ezekiel and the important role it played in the Jewish religion of the period. 41) 39) See note 2. In. addition to the works already mentioned perhaps the clearest evidence of influence from the merkabah traditions of Jewish apocalyptic occurs in the so-called Titleless Work from Nag Hammadi (A. Bohlig and P. Labib, Die Die koptisch-gnostische Schrift ohne Titel aus Codex III von Nag Hammadi im Kop tischentischen Museum z״ Alt-Kairo, Berlin 1962). 40) For the suggestion that apocalyptic is merely the esoteric tradition of the scribal schools see J. Jeremias ,Jerusalem in the Time of Jesus, ET, London 1969, p. 239. Doubt must be cast upon the arbitrary division between the apocalyptic and early rabbinic experiences suggested by J. Maier, Kultus, p. 17 and Gefahr dungsmotiv,dungsmotiv, p. 28, cf. also M. Smith, "Observations on Hekaloth Rabbati" in Biblical Biblical and Other Essays, ed. A. Altmann, Cambridge Mass.1963, p. 155. It cannot be doubted that human initiative did play just as important a role in the apocalyp ticist's experience as it did in rabbinic tradition. The problem of being found acceptable was just as important in apocalyptic, see, for example, Ascension of Isaiah 9, 1-3 and Dan. 10, 1 ff. 41) On this see particularly I. Gruenwald 'Knowledge and Vision', Israel Oriental Oriental Studies 3 (1973) pp. 63 ff. and id. Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism (forthcoming). On the essence of apocalyptic see e.g. Μ. E. Stone 'Lists of Revealed Things in Apocalyptic Literature', in ed. F. M. Cross et al. Magnalia Dei Dei New York 1976, pp. 414 ff. and the essays in ed. J.
