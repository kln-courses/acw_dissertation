<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GENETIC METHOD IN PSYCHOLOGY T HE reporter of the last meeting of the Western Philosophical Association remarks, in this JOURNAL of May 12, among the tendencies of opinion displayed at the meeting, 'a reaction against the analytical psychology in favor of the functional and genetic.' Without raising the topic of 'functional psychology,' or the question as to how any psychology can be other than analytical, one may, not unprofitably, meditate a little upon the exact meaning of genetic psychology. 'The study of mental development,' an easy defini- tion, is, after all, not too definite; it covers not only a variety of particular problems, but certain fundamental differences in point of view which demand radical differences of method. The distinc- tion between ontogenetic and phylogenetic development is one of these; but not the most thoroughgoing. Another division of the problem is even more significant: are we to study the process of mental development in cross-section, or to trace its actual progress from one stage to the next? If we consider these alternative possibilities with reference to the other distinction, that between race and individual development,</page><page sequence="2">492 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY certain points about the methodology of genetic psychology, not new to themselves, may, perhaps, be put into clearer relation with each other. To begin with, taking race development in the broad sense which includes the whole process of the evolution of animal life, we have in the ordinary investigations of comparative or animal psy- chology on adult animals an instance of the cross-section method. What is the content of the mind of this particular animal, at this particular stage of biological and mental evolution? The parallel to this in ordinary, non-genetic psychology is the analytic study of the adult human mind. The problem presented by the psychology of the English sparrow is in itself no more of a genetic problem than that of the psychology of the adult American. Hence, whatever differences in method are involved in the two cases, they are not differences between a genetic method, on the one hand, and an an- alytical or any other non-genetic method, on the other. Various writers have amply discussed the problem presented by the 'inter- pretation of the animal mind'; we are familiar with the fact that, while in interpreting the human mind we have at our disposal the reports in language of our. subject's introspection, in dealing with the animal mind we must rely upon watching the inarticulate be- havior of a subject incapable of introspection; and we have learned to carry out 'Lloyd Morgan's canon' with a rigidity unthought of by its propounder. But whatever the precautions necessary in studying the mental processes of a given animal, such precautions do not constitute a genetic method, any more than do the special precautions necessary in interpreting the results of some laboratory problem of adult human psychology. If we could get a correct idea of the mental processes normal to every species of animal, we should have merely the raw material from which, by comparison, to extract a genetic psychology. An immense difficulty characterizes such a task. On the other hand, precisely this method-of first getting a series of cross-sections at different stages and then, by comparison of these among them- selves, arriving at an idea of the processes of development involved -is the one lying directly at hand in the study of individual devel- opment. The reason for this difference is, of course, that in the latter case all the stages are readily accessible to us. We have the individual at hand; we can take our cross-sections as often as we please, observing the precautions that make for accuracy; and, al- though the interpretation of a baby's mind, or the mind of a kitten, at a given moment, is no more a matter of genetic method than the interpretation of an adult mind, yet here one may collect the raw material so rapidly and pass so directly to comparison, that the dis- tinction between the cross-section method and the historical method,</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 493 if one may so term the tracing of actual progress from one stage to another, is of much less importance. Despite the fact that the collection of material by the cross-section plan is so much simpler for the ontogeny than for the phylogeny of mind, we do not find that the psychology of individual development is so far advanced, nor the case of phylogenetic psychology so hope- less, as we might expect. Especially when we read works on the development of the individual mind, our impression is that of having the series of cross-sections presented to us without the genetic psy- chology; there is no tracing of an evolutionary process whose laws are made out. On the other hand, despite the scanty and hard-won material, we are beginning to get glimpses of the bearing and ra- tionale of the whole process of mental development in the world of animal life. The reason for this is not remote. It is harder to get a posteriori material, but easier to apply a priori principles in the study of mental phylogenesis, than in that of mental ontogenesis. While the actual course of mental development may be more readily traced in the individual than in the animal world at large, it is less difficult to explain mental development in the latter case than in the former. The evolution of the individual mind is a problem whose answer is to a large extent hidden in the structure of the individual brain. We may know that process B regularly makes its appearance after process A, but when we ask why, there is nothing to be said except that a certain brain connection is perfected at this point. It may be because of some prehistoric condition of species development, or it may be a mere accidental resultant of forces far too complex and hidden ever to be traced out. But, while in mental ontogenesis the development of nervous structures in a certain predestined order is the sole basis for the appearance of mental functions in a given sequence, while, therefore, the causal relation is from nervous struc- ture to mental function, the case is in a sense reversed when we deal with the evolution of mind in the animal kingdom. The main reason for the preservation of any complex nervous structure in phylo- genesis must be the value to the organism of the accompanying mental process. Here, then, we can with some safety argue from mental process to nervous process, from the usefulness or. harmful- ness of a given psychosis to the development or non-development of the corresponding neurosis. We have thus not only a principle for the explanation of the facts obtained by investigation, but a basis for supplementing these facts by a priori predictions. If we can say with a fair degree of confidence that a certain course of develop- ment would have been contrary to an organism's needs, then we may maintain that it probably did not occur. If certain phases of</page><page sequence="4">494 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY mental growth can have been of survival-value only when certain other phases were already present, then we may make assumptions about the sequence of these phases without waiting for the accumula- tion of material by the cross-section method. Merely finding out what happens in the mind of an animal or of a child, at a certain given stage of development, calls for no method differing fundamentally from those used in ordinary psychology; only for certain special precautions. The task of genetic psychol- ogy proper is twofold: to trace the course of the changes that take place from stage to stage, and to understand, so far as possible, the reasons for these changes. Animal psychology, in the first part of its task, is greatly helped by the application of some form of the principle of natural selection; in the second, it must rely almost entirely upon this principle. Natural selection does not account for the origin of variations; it may be that they occur per saltum. But, even if it does not completely rationalize the process of mental evolution, it is the only universally accepted rationalizing principle we have at our service. Genetic psychology, in this sense, has scarcely begun its career. The preparatory cross-section work, even, is but just perfecting its methods; after the rash anthropomorphism of the early Darwinians there has grown up in natural reaction the tendency to accumulate facts without interpretation. But the in- terpretation is, nevertheless, an essential part of the science of genetic psychology. In child psychology, however, there is little hope of getting be- hind the mere facts. For the present, our only glimpses of inter- pretation come when we can apply the laws of species development to the individual; and the difficulty and uncertainty of this attempt are sufficiently evident in the labors of the Clark University School. The individual mind may in its evolution be an epitome of the his- tory of the species, but it is an epitome written in almost unde- cipherable shorthand. MARGARET FLOY WASHBURN.
