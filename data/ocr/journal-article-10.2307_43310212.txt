<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHETYPAL CRITICISM The article that follows, "The Femivore: An Unnamed Archetype," by Roger Schlobin was presented first at the 1988 Conference on the Fantastic. It generated so much interest and so much comment that many of us felt that JFA ought to take a special interest in archetypal criticism. To that end, we are ac- tively seeking such criticism. It should be mailed to Roger. He is interested both in tracing the "femivore" archetype through other mediums and through other works, as well as ar- chetypal criticism on any other piece of art or literature. Such pieces may be of any length, from a mere note to a full-length article. Carl B.

Schlobin ...Nothing is surer than that we [men] will no longer desire them [women], for one does not desire what one possesses. Giovanni Giacomo Casanova de Seingalt (1725-98) Playboy, buck, stud, Don Juan, rake, wolf, rogue, Lothario, Bluebeard, roue, incubus, satyr, hunk, "the Fonz," romeo, babe, lady killer, Casanova - all are names and terms that have been used to describe the sexually active, multiple-partnered male. Curiously, even though such figures have received specific scholarly attention and social admiration throughout the ages, the single entity they mirror has never been specifically identi- fied or labeled. This is particularly odd since, despite the exten- sive contemporary feminist preoccupation with the modern de- structive male, the figure is actually an ancient, primordial entity and a pervasive archetype. Sherri S. Tepper in her contemporary horror novel, The Bones , provides an apt and universal label for this archetype, the "femi- vore" (222). For Tepper's protagonist, Marie, he "'...was simply too good-looking by far, improbably good-looking. He broadcast a kind of fatal fascination. Like Count Dracula. The kind of man who eats women for breakfast - and lunch and dinner7" (221- 222). The femivore's essential nature is that he infatuates and seduc- es women and leaves them bereft of spiritual and often physical life. He sucks them dry, dooming them to perpetual states of waiting. He has ever been the Dionysian swashbuckler, beguil- ing and faithless. Most often, in literature and mythology, he es- capes consequences and responsibilities and is allowed to re- main a memorable and ephemeral treasure whose supernatural prowess defies mere mortals. His characteristic departure is of- ten shrouded in mystery (or the story just ends). Sometimes his real appearance is concealed by simple disguises, such as the masked lover. In more supernatural moments, he is a shape- shifter (metamorph) as is Zeus with Leda and DanaÃ«. In all cas- The Femivore Page 89</page><page sequence="4">es, he is unbearably independent (Jung, 25) and does not linger to concern himself with the futures of the ravished females he leaves behind. Such a creature, of course, makes any sense of love and eros in- consequential. The femivore's concerns are immediate and lust- ful. He doesn't nurture. Thus, he debilitates any sense of past or future. He makes the most incredible things believable, even Sleeping Beauty's kiss. As such, he violates women's traditional fantasies of security, social and financial acceptance and stabili- ty, and marriage to the Father Reborn. He summons to full, pas- sionate life the clay that, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, should be somnolent to insure salvation. Bram Dijkstra, even though he is speaking from the decidedly masculine milieu of the Fin-de- Siecle in Idols of Perversity, nonetheless captures the diabolical content here: The phallus, the snake, "...with its uncontrollable capacity to spring forward, was indeed the satanic companion to the woman whose presence caused it to uncoil" (305). Within the more modern, elevated concept of self- actualization, the femivore is the male who dooms the female to a secondary, dormant life in which she exists simply as the wait- ing explosive for blazes of inconsequential romance, the state Madonna Kolbenschlag identifies so well through her descrip- tions of the "formula female" and the "other-oriented female" in Kiss Sleeping-Beauty Good-Bye: Breaking the Spell of Feminine Myths and Models. Within the carnal present the femivore creates, his pagan lure is irresistible, and he is a creature of fantasy at its most extreme, both immature and foolish. From this definition, it would be easy enough to label the fem- ivore as misogynist and wastrel: indifferent to humanity in women, insensitive and irresponsible to all but himself. He might slide smoothly into the concept of intercourse as a punish- ing tool to which men subject women, as Andrea Dworkin indi- cates in her novel Fire and Ice and nonfiction work Intercourse. At worst, literary types like the vampire, the demon lover (incubus), and Svengali figures come to mind, destructive in their posses- siveness, diabolically and seminally evil. As such, the purposeful femivore is the ugly inversion of the father (Frye's false father [199]) who must discard his daughters and who remains ever out of reach, poisoning all future encounters. This is, of course, the curse of Terisa's father in Stephen R. Donaldson's The Mirror of Her Dreams and A Man Rides Through, Mordant's Need. In Page 90 Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts</page><page sequence="5">Western European culture, the penultimate illustration of this oc- curs in Eden. It is sadly indicative of masculine-dominated per- ceptions that, for centuries, no one seems to have cared that Eve is seduced first by a masculine numen, Lucifer/Satan; only then does Adam fall victim to her "feminine wiles/7 One of history's cruelest stupidities is that the blatant scapegoating of the first step has been ignored. Other examples of the rampaging male echo throughout literature, popular culture, and folklore: the cal- lousness of the seducers in Samuel Richardson's Pamela and Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter , the destructiveness in The Thousand Nights and One Night and of Bluebeard, and the in- difference in Geoffrey Chaucer's "Clerk's Tale" and the films Gone with the Wind, Looking for Mr. Goodbar, and American Gigolo. However, unlike his female counterparts, the nixie (Jung, 25) and the Maenad, and the obvious male villains (i.e., the vam- pire), the femivore is rarely presented or perceived as evil, espe- cially by those he victimizes and those who chronicle and relish his conquests. As such, he is deceptive. In fact, he is a prime ex- ample of incarnate social fantasy and its duality. Objectively, he is a fleeting parasite who should be anathema to all women. Yet, even among the intelligent and enlightened, he is the shaman of swoons and utter devotion, much like Michael Valentine Smith in Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land. He is miscon- ceived as mischievous, even nonthreateningly boyish. His charm is, in part, like the fauns', those playful demigods who flip skirts and pinch bottoms. Deeply insidious, if not fully disguised by the cloak of socialized fantasy, the femivore is not relevant to the battles between the sexes upon which Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar focus ("Sex Wars" passim; No Man's passim). No, between the ever-adolescent femivore and his welcoming fe- male, there is no struggle, only submission, in their willing bond- ings. This is no game of Ombre, mock or otherwise. Indeed, the femivore as archetype and social role model has lead numerous adolescent males through the rite of passage of casual sex (sport fucking) - the "find 'em, feel 'em, fuck 'em, forget 'em" pattern. He is what C.G. Jung calls the "original Man," the one-sided sexual being (Jung, 71) who is all animus and no anima. More expansively, the dreams, behaviors, and rites of passage of misguided and excessively socialized women ("Wendys") and ever-adolescent males ("Peter Pans") are mirrors of the frequent- ly romanticized femivore when he serves as admirable male par- The Femivore Page 91</page><page sequence="6">agon and vision of transformation (e.g., Cinderella) and she as desirable female companion. This archetypal pattern is obvious in the contemporary "bodice rippers" known as Harlequin or gothic romances. Amid the mundane, the femivore festers as an accepted and falsely innocuous part of life's furniture and auto- matically assumed fantasies. He need not be obvious or even de- liberate. Like Isaac Asimov's Mule in Foundation and Empire, the femivore and his rapturous female victims only acquire con- sciences and guilt if they ever become aware of the true nature of their desires and couplings. Social acceptance prevents this from happening, either in the minds of artistic creators or characters. The femivore and victim celebrate an unconscious subjugation to the rite of sexual ruination. He is seduction without fruition. It is his nature to leave - fidelity is beyond his abilities - and while the female may empirically know this, she refuses emotionally to acknowledge it, choosing instead to consecrate and consummate herself to oblivion. The cause of the femivore' s vitality is clear. He is bound irrev- ocable to many materializations of the hero, even when he is the "lovable bastard." Normal people are always helpless before he- roes, and women are expected to fawn into sexual surrender be- fore these conquerors as they continually move form feat to trial, leaving broken hearts (and devastated psyches and self- concepts) scattered behind them. Thus, one necessary task in the recognition of the femivore is to reassess definitions of the heroic with and eye on its exploitative nature. In this, the hero may be a subtle, likable, socially enviable, and glamorous rapist, for whom beguilement replaces force. Bram Dijkstra offers a striking, carnal description of the rela- tionship between the femivore and the pliable woman: The virgin and the whore, the saint and the vampire - two designations for a single dualistic opposition: that of woman as man's exclusive and forever pliable private property, on the one hand, and her transformation, upon her denial of man's ownership rights to her, into a poly- androus predator indiscriminately lusting after man's social essence, on the other (334). Nina Auerbach's justification for the inevitable conquest of the femivore, in Woman and the Devil: The Life of a Victorian Myth , is Page 92 Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts</page><page sequence="7">more psychological and civilized: femivores "are endowed with a magic beyond their own; they possess the secret tradition of the culture," within which "the women they captivate seem not just enfeebled but culturally naked" (16). As compelling and engaging as Dijkastra's and Auerbach's de- scriptions are, they fail because they do not plumb the depths that an archetype involves. Both the femivore and his willing vic- tims are, indeed, fonts for the astonishing mythological histories of the virgin birth and the birth of the hero. The "secret tradi- tion" to which Auerbach mysteriously alludes is really not ar- cane; rather, it is the mythic legacy of humanity's long primor- dial traditions surrounding human women - experiencing supernatural impregnation, being the vehicles for virgin births, and bearing heroes and gods. These events are made of the very essences of magic and functional fantasy. By definition, the am- orous visitations of frolicking, anthropomorphic deities are a "psychic genesis"; everything about them must be non-empirical and of the "highest good" (Jung, 166). The lusty visitations of these "Invisible Unknowns" (Campbell, Hero, 297) and "Expected Ones" (Kolbenschlag, 108) embody all the "other- centered" female fantasies of the perfect child, the hero-son, and ulitmate fulfillment of fruition. Consider the following wonder children, selected for their chronological and geographic indica- tiveness, that fill human history and bear testament to the bÃ©nÃ©fi- cient visitations of benevolent femivores: the Babylonian Sargon I; the Hindu Krishna; the Summerian Tammuz; the Toltec Quetzalcoatl (Campbell, Primitive, 457); the Black Feet Little Star; the Roman Romulus and Remus; the Greek Perseus, Hercules, and Telephus; the Aztec Coatliuce; the Tongaese Fatai-going- underneath-sandlewood (Campbell, Hero, 312); the Persian Zoroaster; and the Christian Christ. In light of these divine gifts, is it too surprising that women, throughout history, have yearn- ingly awaited the carnal embraces of the Egyptian Ra/Re (Campbell, Oriental, 98-100), the Christian Holy Ghost, the Irish Lovetalker (Duffy, 47), the Greek Zeus, the German Odin and Loki, the Toltec All-Father, the Eskimo Bird-Phantom who se- duces SÃ©dna, the Black Feet Morning Star, and even the pedestri- n knight-errant? If these circumstances seem too provincial or rchaic to modern audiences, recently, the growing Elvis Presley ult has given rise to reports of virgin births and spiritual inter- ourse, demonstrating the continuing vitality of this mythology. fhe Femivore Page 93</page><page sequence="8">In addition, the activities and supplicatory oblations of female rock and athletic "groupies" have often been chronicled. Such ce- lebrity rites of sexual surrender prove only too well that each age worships its own gods. This willingness to wait for transformation by an external, magic force has plagued women throughout time (Dijkstra, 318). It illustrates the religious phenomenon of awe, the state of blind belief in and obedience to appearances and fixed ideas that have been distilled by religious and social dogma. This continuing, rit- ual participation is what Joseph Campbell identifies as surrender by general humanity to a system of "historically conditioned sentiments activities, and beliefs..." ( Primitive , 462). Women are particularly susceptible to such submissions because of the tradi- tional social and spiritual oppression and exploitation that they have suffered for ages and continue to suffer. As Kolbenschlag observes: If Don Juan is the archetypal male aesthete [from Kierkegaard in Either/Or as the life characterized by im- mersion in the immediate; the "accidental person" ], his victims are archetypal female aesthetes. 'To seduce all girls is the masculine expression of the feminine yearn- ing to let herself be seduced once and with all her heart and soul." Thus, the absence of commitment to the self, the compulsion to "live for another," to be psychically annihilated and controlled by someone beyond the self - common symptoms of female psychology - are the characteristics of the minimal level of spiritual existence. This level of existence is marked by illusion, since power over oneself has been given over to someone outside oneself (24). The femivore's false promises are the expectations of power and the acquisition of magic. Contemporary manifestations of women's frustrated need for power are, of course, the "shopping syndrome" (Kolbenschlag, 17-18) and, from the realm of the cin- ema, the recent films that demonstrate the power of older wom- en over younger, Dionysian men, such as A Night in Heaven, In Praise of Older Women, and In the Mood, the last supposedly the true story of the teen-age Woo Woo Kid, who married older women with the best of intentions. Thus, the silver screen con- Page 94 Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts</page><page sequence="9">tends that there is now even hope for middle-aged women, who have lived beyond the socially acceptable standard of beauty, to redeem their "barren" lives. Tania Modleski, in Loving with a Vengeance: Mass-Producei Fantasies for Women, provides a model2 that yields further and more penetrating insight into this "pow- er" that women seek in their bondings with femivores in her ex- amination of the Harlequin romance and its link to the nine- teenth century traditions of Samuel Richardson, Charlotte BrontÃ« (Jane Eyre), and Jane Austen ( Pride and Prejudice). Modleski de- scribes the male-female interaction as follows: the male, older protaganist is "...mocking, cynical, contemptuous, often hostile, and even somewhat brutal. By the end, however, all misunder- standings are cleared away, and the hero reveals his love for the heroine, who reciprocates" (36). What Modleski's description of an enormously popular female myth shows is that women are not only awaiting transformation but are also seeking the god- like power to transform. This is common enough, and it is the rare individual that has not seen women enter into relationships with debilitating men with clear visions of "fixing" them and "mending their ways" once single males become husbands (a de- sire that frustration will often transfer to male children). Thus, women do seek the roles of priestess and shaper, not just generatrix. Yet, historically, women's power to transform and their com- pulsions to be transformed are rarely realized in their interac- tions with "significant" males. The femivore, divine child, and the virgin birth demonstrate women's secondary priorities to vis- itations from male deities and to greater wonders and magic. In the literature, art, theology, folklore, and mythology of the femi- vore, women are rarely more than vessels that gain little except passing interest from Â¿heir creators to their lovers. Women fade away or into the background before the grandeurs of great good- ness and omnipotent causes. An obvious illustration of this is Mary, who is but a pale and emasculated version of her historic antecedent, the Earth Mother/Mother Goddess (Kolbenschlag, 186). Why the femivore himself behaves as he does could be easily dismissed with superficial psychology. For example, he suffers from satyriasis, the socially approved form of nymphomania. He is insecure or lonely. He fears imprisonment, the feminine pow- er of engulfment, the loss of power. Certainly, there is something The Femivore Page 95</page><page sequence="10">to all of this (if only from the viewpoint of active and functional rationalizations), and femivorism does lead so many males to spiritually and emotionally destructive and barren existences. From the social and psychological perspectives, however, to leave the causes of the vitality of the femivore to either sex is gravely erroneous. His existence requires a conspiracy and a mu- tual acquiescence from both sexes. The couplings of femivores and victims repeat archtypal patterns in which they both seek in- dividually and mutually destructive power. Most curiously, there is false pride and hope that derives from participating, that somehow this ageless conspiracy brings the divine into the mor- tal. Such repetitive sacrifices of the flesh and the psyche through- out all human history and art point to the great danger of ignor- ance and insensitivity. Those who do not understand can only mirror and repeat. Life happens to them, and femivore and vic- tim both denigrate what it means to be human. From the more positive perspective of literary criticism, the ex- ploration of the femivore and other archtypes demonstrate how critical the interdisciplinary and international "fantastic sensibili- ty" can be to revisioning art and thought. By deviating sharply from traditional intellectual restrictions of time and field, it un- covers not only the subtle, but the obvious, thereby creating new epistemologies. Indeed, by their very natures, archtypal images are stunningly obvious once articulated. What remains for the femivore and other such "new" discoveries is to view and test them on the broadest possible stage of history and knowledge. If they are legitimate and essential parts of the past and future of the human conditions, they should appear over and over again across the full spectrum of both the mundane and the lofty activ- ities of people and artists as they play out their lives.

I am indebted to the nu- merous and generous observations and suggestions that its presentation in- spired, especially to those of Kathryn Hume, Carl B. Yoke, and Veronica Hollinger. z While this male-female mythology may be potent modern force, its antiquity is unquestioned. Beside all appropriate material surrounding heroic art, Chaucer's "Clerk's Tale" is almost perfect match for the "modern" Harlequin romance. REFERENCES Auerbach, Nina.
