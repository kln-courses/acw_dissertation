Skyway to Tomorrowland In the early days of Disneyland, one Tomorrowland attraction was the Autopia, where youngsters could drive actual, though miniature, automobiles. Disney intended these young citizens-to-be to thus learn traffic safety at an early age and hence to be prepared to enter the L.A. freeway system. Unfortunately, the children took "demented delight" in crashing the cars, and the ride had to be put on tracks.' One can hardly blame the kids for resisting the park's immaculately conceived system of guidance, but the Disney ethos could not tolerate these signs of technological breakdown. Disneyland began as a park where Walt could extend his miniature train set within a framework of realistic landscape effects. A fascination with Amer- icana further informed the project, and dioramas depicting historical periods and events (much like the tableaux of early film history) were placed along the train's route in a "coherent sequence." Finally, its design worked to construct a safe and clean environment, thoroughly distinct from the chaos and boorishness of the traditional amusement park. The result was an America reduced, frozen, 1. Randy Bright, Disneyland: Inside Story (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1987), p. 88.</page><page sequence="2">Walt Disney, Vice-President Richard Nixon, Pat, Julie, and Tricia Nixon at Disneyland. 1959. and sanitized-a fortress against the dis-ease of '50s society. Walt announced that "Disneyland is going to be a place where you can't get lost."2 At Walt Disney World, whose Florida acreage is twice that of Manhattan, these tendencies are exaggerated. The Magic Kingdom and EPCOT Center are now supplemented by Typhoon Lagoon (a water theme park), Pleasure Island (discos and other "entertainment"), Fort Wilderness Campground, the Disney/ MGM Studio Theme Park,3 numerous hotels, and a convention center. It is no longer possible to "do" the entire facility in a week-long vacation, although many families frantically try. In the terminology of Arthur Kroker, Disney World has become a "panic vacation."4 Tomorrowland grows more wonderful with the passage of every year, as its parabolic, populuxe stylings give full and nostalgic voice to the aspirations of the New Frontiers exhibit of the 1964 New York World's Fair (although its concrete expanses also suggest a down-at-the-heels airport). Its boomerang- inflected balustrades stand in extroverted contrast to the imploded and anon- ymous mall-structures of EPCOT's Future World. EPCOT Center was Walt's dream of an Experimental Prototype Community Of Tomorrow: real futures, brought to you by real corporations. This latter-day ode to tomorrow could be any corporate plaza on the outskirts of any urban area. Its immaculate commons, 2. Ibid., p. 56. 3.

It unintentionally becomes the most charming of retro-futures. Tomorrowland-the very name carries a casual colloquialism. Tomorrow is, after all, not so far away, while land suggests the whimsicality of the fairy tale (it is an all-important suffix in conveying a childlike innocence or nostalgia). Its extension at EPCOT, however, is something more than an exercise in self- similarity: Future World is a state of mind rather than a spatial location; a corporate symbol of monadic inclusiveness.5 The future is indefinite and per- manent; the world is inescapable and boundless. Tomorrowland holds promise; Future World sounds like a threat. The expansiveness of the missions to Mars and exploration among the stars is replaced by the imploded concern with the cybernetic spaces of information management. These Disney worlds bear an interesting relation to works of contemporary science-fiction literature and cinema in which ontologies of space and narrative combine and often contradict one another. Science fiction can be said to provide the referential dimension that is absent from the disembodied spaces of the electronic realm: the function of the genre, then, is to compensate for the loss of the human in the labyrinths of blip culture by transforming it into an arena susceptible to human control. Recent science fiction frequently posits a recon- ception of the human and the ability to interface with the new terminal para- 5.

Referring to the 1939 World's Fair, H. Bruce Franklin has correctly noted that "A fair billing itself as the World of Tomorrow may be considered just as much a work of science fiction as a short story or a novel, a comic book or a movie."6 This is surely also true of Tomorrowland or Future World-exhibi- tions that carry the visitor into an ambivalently defined future.' The Disney futures are simultaneously reactionary and progressive, nostalgic and challeng- ing. They are also richly imbricated with the shifting experiences and metaphors of postmodern urbanism, electronic culture, and pervasive redefinitions of space 6. Bruce H.

Please keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times. 2. Retro-Futures The pervasive fear in the decade just past was a consequence of recogniz- ing that we already inhabit the future. No longer was "The Future" a harmless fiction, a utopian era that, by its very definition, will never arrive; it was, instead, upon us, and with a vengeance. Our presence in the future has thus initiated an obsessive recycling of the past, a seemingly inexhaustible period of mega- nostalgia-a return to a period of (imaginary) mastery and an attempt to answer the question "How did I get here?" for cause and effect have vanished within the random intricacies of quantum reality. Even futures past are now exhumed and aired, their quaint fantasies simultaneously mocked and desired.

The comic book character Zot lives in one of the wonderfully bulbous cities designed by Frank R. Paul for the cover of any issue of Amazing Stories. These are reveries of progress based upon visibility. William Gibson's science-fiction short story "The Gernsback Continuum" is about the end of the future. A photographer engaged to capture images of the utopian architectures of Frank Lloyd Wright and other 1930s and '40s futurists enters one of those zones endemic in postmodern fiction ("Ever so gently, I went over the Edge"). In a giant ontological shift, he finds himself within this imaged, imagined, but never created retro-future. Gibson's descrip- tion perfectly evokes the aspirations of another age, but it also sounds like a trip to Disneyland: They were white, blond, and they probably had blue eyes. They were American. Dialta had said that the Future had come to America first, but had finally passed it by. But not here, in the heart of the Dream. Here, we'd gone on and on, in a dream logic that knew nothing of pollution, the finite bounds of fossil fuel, of foreign wars it was possible to lose. They were smug, happy, and utterly content with themselves and their world. And in the Dream, it was their world. Behind me, the illuminated city: Searchlights swept the sky for the sheer joy of it. I imagined them thronging the plazas of white marble, orderly and alert, their bright eyes shining with enthusiasm for their floodlit avenues and silver cars.8 To exorcise these "semiotic ghosts," the narrator watches television until they go away. If the retro-futures are structured through externalization and visibility, the architecture of Future World bespeaks the very erosion of the visible and dataist implosion behind the mirrors of anonymous techno-cultural interfaces. The rides behind these facades, however, are relentlessly, reassuringly, human, thanks to the simulation technologies of Audio-AnimatronicsTM. The Horizons pavilion at EPCOT Center (presented by General Electric), for example, con- tains an exemplary retro-future exhibit entitled "Looking Back at Tomorrow." "People had some pretty mixed up ideas about the future," the narrator says (smugly) as "guests" are treated to the sweetly simulated futures of Jules Verne, Georges M61ies, Fritz Lang, Buck Rogers, Hugo Gernsback, and the Jetsons. The return to the retro-futures of the 1920s through the '50s speaks to a perceived loss of subjective comprehension of, or control over, the invisible cyber-histories and cyber-spaces of the present. This is the dataist era; the 8.

Narrative Strategies "Disneyland," notes Thomas Hine in Populuxe, "was the first place ever conceived simultaneously with a TV series," and the park is assuredly notable for its overall narrative character. The Magic Kingdom was designed, not by architects, but by filmmakers, Hine continues-not as a group of buildings, but as an experience. It was "a movie that could be walked into."9 One is led along Main Street, U.S.A., toward the pinnacles of Fantasyland's castles. At the central square, towering Starjets lead to Tomorrowland, while other monuments lead to further adventures. Philip Johnson has stated that the park's architecture was dedicated not to the design of space but to "the organization of proces- sion."'1 A general telos operates whether one concentrates on the overall struc- ture of the entire park, the features of the various lands, or the details on each of the buildings-an experience described by Hine as a sequence of establishing shots, medium shots, and close-ups. Several writers have observed the manner in which the rides mimic the proairetic and hermeneutic structures of narrative: "Each car is wired for stereophonic sound and turns electronically so that the occupant sees only what the designer has intended . . .exactly the way the movie camera sees."" The topics of these rides are intensely narrative as well-Peter Pan's Flight recapitulates the entire narrative of the film, encounters with giant plastic sea creatures in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea are narrated by an ersatz James Mason, and the famed Jungle Cruise provides a human guide pretending to steer the vessel while interacting with the real flora and pseudo-fauna. Even the roller coaster, whose raison d'etre is purely kinetic sensation, is narrativized in the Magic Kingdom. Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain are geographi- cally specific simulated experiences (a space flight, a runaway train) which arguably add little to the basic pleasures of gravity. Narrative provides a comforting paradigm for the physical experience. It is not a startling innovation, this commingling of kinesis and narrative-as Raymond Fielding pointed out in 1957, Disney's Trip to the Moon is only an updating of the Hale's Tours exhibits that were popular between 1904 and 1906. Audiences for Hale's Tours boarded a mock train carriage, and while a film of exotic locales played up ahead, the coach would be rocked, and a breeze might even play over them.

Ibid., p. 120.</page><page sequence="8">62 OCTOBER features a preflight area, seats that move in a simulacrum of gravitational effects, a film view of the exotic Martian landscape through upper and lower "windows," and even a fictitious crisis for dramatic effect. This combination of simulation and transportation was, as noted, a basic principle of the park's conception. The WEDway (as in Walter E. Disney) People Mover has the distinction of being a ride with no purpose beyond demonstrating its own technology (it remains one of the most relaxing attractions at the park). As I shall show, the implications of the rides of Tomorrowland bear upon the ontological status of the subject in an era defined by an implosive and disembodying proliferation of electronic technologies. 4. Futurama Seemingly opposed to the banality of the Disney narrative experience is the tough posturing of cyberpunk science fiction, a popular subgenre in the 1980s. John Clute, a science-fiction editor and critic, has described a crisis in science-fiction representation that is grounded in the passage from the thrusting promise of the space age to the invisible circulations and movements of the electronic age: No longer has information any tangible, kinetic analogue in the world of the senses, or in the imaginations of writers of fiction. Gone are the great arrays of vacuum tubes, the thousands of toggles that heroes of space fiction would flick almost faster than the eye could see as they dodged space "torpedoes," outflanked alien "battle lines," steered through asteroid "storms"; gone, more importantly, is any sustained sense of the autonomy, in space and time, of gross visible individual human actions. And if "actions" are now invisible, then our fates are likewise beyond our grasp. We no longer feel that we penetrate the future; futures penetrate us.'2 Technological change has moved into the terminal spaces of the computer, the video screen, and the fiber-optic cable. Through its surreal yet plausible spa- tialization of electronic culture, cyberpunk science fiction achieved real impor- tance. The invisible spaces of the computer are metaphorically "entered" by the physiologically enhanced "cyberspace cowboys" of William Gibson's Neuromancer (1984), for example, reinstating the possibility of "visible individual human actions." Cyberpunk stages a rejection of the white towers of technocracy in favor of a street-level science fiction exemplified in cinema by the retrofitted urbanism 12.

Cyberpunk polemicist Bruce Sterling writes: Science fiction . .. has always been about the impact of technology. But times have changed since the comfortable era of Hugo Gerns- back, when Science was safely enshrined-and confined-in an ivory tower. The careless technophilia of those days belongs to a vanished, sluggish era, when authority still had a comfortable margin of con- trol.13 The measured forms of instrumental reason no longer dominate the techno- sphere which has now slipped, as Baudrillard continually notes, into a self- regulating and implosive state. Cyberpunk is notorious for its repudiation of this ivory-towered confi- dence, this faith in a future that works: this is not quite true of Disney's Horizons. Following its reactionary retrospective of retro-futures, Horizons presents its own set of prognostications based upon the now-dubious premise of technolog- ical progress devoid of social implications. Improved urbanism, undersea farm- ing (a Disney mania), colonies in outer space-nothing disturbs the stability of the white, heterosexual, middle-class, extended nuclear family. (Speaking of the nuclear, how is all this powered?) Indeed, tranquillity is improved, as holo- graphic videophones permit instantaneous communication. The simple but unavoidable irony of this Audio-Animated diorama is that it involves not even the gesture toward a social reality to be found in Lang's Metropolis or the poetry of his Frau du Mond or Mlies's Voyage dans la lune. The outmoded futures retain a special vibrancy: the Disney version is at once more utopian, more banal, and more ignorant. Only the citizens, in their homogenized glory, are revealed and encountered, their lives conveniently (and convention- ally) narrativized. The central planning apparatus (corporate? governmental?) remains invisible, functioning as the omniscient narrator of this future world and its successes. Franklin has described Futurama as "the corporation that plans and builds, while the people are purely passive, comfortably watching the creation in motion as mere spectators."'4 5.

City planner James Rouse declared Disneyland "the greatest piece of urban design in the U.S. today. . . . Think of its performance in relation to its purpose."'6 Margaret King argues that Disneyland/World humanizes its tech- nology through architecture: The Disney town is a kind of stage based on architectural symbols for romanticized, stylized human interaction. ... The example of the parks may provide an alternative vision of what people seek in urban environments: everyday life as an art form, with entertain- ment, fantasy, play-acting, role-playing and the reinstatement of some of the values which have been lost in the megalopolis.'7 Guy Debord's projection of the ideal Situationist city anticipates the divi- sion of the theme parks into separate monadic "lands" or "worlds": 15.

Each quarter will tend toward a specific harmony, divided off from neighboring harmonies; or else will play on a max- imum breaking up of internal harmony.'8 The Situationist's division of the city also echoes the psychologist's topology of the brain. "The districts . . . could correspond to the whole spectrum of diverse feelings that one encounters by chance in everyday life," Ivan Chtcheglov pro- poses, listing the Bizarre and Happy Quarters as examples.'9 Souvenir maps of Disneyland in fact suggest such a model: the different-colored lands echo the diagrams of cerebral lobes, while Main Street mimics the stalk of the central nervous system leading into the central hub (the corpus calossum) that links these different regions. One might take this idea further-it's surely interesting that the rough-and-ready macho pragmatism represented by Frontierland and Ad- ventureland are located in the left brain, while the whimsy of Fantasyland and 18.

Situations were designed to provoke a recognition of alienation and permit the perception of the reifications of spectacle. The division of urban space would produce maximal harmonies and disharmonies, a notion exploited in science fiction (Samuel Delany's Triton features an anarchic, libidinal, "unlicensed zone." Theater groups roam the zone, abruptly staging performances for "micro- audiences" of one). Can one perceive, in these Situationist texts of 1953-58 (Disneyland opened in 1955), an impulse towards a politicized Disneyland-the theme park as Situation and unitary urban field? "That which changes our way of seeing the streets is more important than what changes our way of seeing painting. . .. It is necessary to throw new forces into the battle of leisure."21 6. Imploded Fields The "guests" circulate through the "lands" of the Magic Kingdom or the "worlds" of EPCOT Center. When Disneyland first opened, there was no ana- logue for this aimless travel, this dirive, but now the shopping mall endows these environments with phenomenological and sociological familiarity. Malls aspire to the same monadism as the Disney worlds,22 and their designs echo that of the parks with varying explicitness. Parking is relegated to vast outside areas, leaving the "real world" invisible beyond the boundaries of the commercial kingdoms (and one must note Baudrillard's wonderful caveat that the real world only seems real against the background of Disneyland's explicit simulations). Perhaps, as in the hypermall in Edmonton, Alberta, there is even an amusement park. The spectacle has even come full circle: the national shopping pavilions and restaurants. of EPCOT's World Showcase (opened in 1982) recall the kiosks and "food courts" of countless suburban malls, while the malls incorporate the rides and themes of the Disney parks. The World Showcase represents a peculiar implosion of American tourism: foreign lands are further reduced and domes- ticated, rendered safe while remaining absurdly picturesque (with actual na- tives).23 Welcome-with apologies to Professor McLuhan-to the global mall. 20.

This monadism is presented and simultaneously critiqued in George Romero's witty Dawn of the Dead (1978), a film which plays like a pulp version of Adorno and Horkheimer's Dialectic of Enlightenment. 23. Citizens, usually teenagers, of the various countries represented at EPCOT work at the park for year-long periods.</page><page sequence="13">There's Always Tomorrowland 67 William Kowinski proposes that strolling through a mall is analogous to walking around inside a giant TV. One chooses from among an abundance of selections (stores equal channels), solicited by an array of colorful enticements and standardized slickness, overwhelmed by the overall electronic buzz. Arthur Kroker makes the same comparison, but in post-cyberpunk language: "Shop- ping malls are liquid TVs for the end of the twentieth century .... Shopping malls have this big advantage over TV, they play every sense. . . . A whole image-repertoire which, when successful, splays the body into a multiplicity of organs, all demanding to be filled." The body implodes within the cyberspace of the shopping mall. Here history demands the recognition of Disney's achievement in the 1950s as the first film producer to exploit the medium of television. "Disneyland" was a gigantic promotional piece for this new park: the behind-the-scenes footage, old films, and new productions ("Davy Crockett," for example) were all geared toward selling the new attraction (Richard Schickel even argues that Disneyland represented a uniquely new medium). ABC financed the new park by buying over one third of the shares of Disneyland, Inc.24 If William Thomp- son, calling the park a "technological cathedral," noted in 1971 that "Disneyland itself is a kind of television set,"25 then it is worth stressing that the mutually reinforcing symbiosis of the Disneyland/world/mall and the implosive reality of television is not coincidental, but designed. 6A.

Terminal Tactics From Michel de Certeau's The Practice of Everyday Life: I call a strategy the calculation (or manipulation) of power relation- ships that becomes possible as soon as a subject with will and power (a business, an army, a city, a scientific institution) can be isolated. It postulates a place that can be delimited as its own and serve as the 24. Schickel, The Disney Version, p. 313. 25.

Reagan presided over a Disneyfied version of America--the Audio-Animatronic president.</page><page sequence="14">68 OCTOBER base from which relations with an exteriority composed of targets or threats . .. can be managed.27 De Certeau's researches are pertinent to the strategic spaces of Disney World and Disneyland ("a business, an army, a city, a scientific institution").28 As Robert Venturi has noted of all utopias, the Disney spaces exist in relation to the hostile environments lying beyond their gates. These are protected environments, sustained only by a massive infusion of capital on a daily basis. Citizenship in the Magic Kingdom costs about thirty dollars per day, per park. The populist, apolitical, futuristic perfection is thus an illusion dependent upon the commod- ity's denial of its exchange-value and its pretense to a pure use-value (EPCOT becomes an educational experience, rather than a gimmicky amusement park). The thirty-dollar "passport" purchased at the gates permits the visitor to cir- culate "freely" through this delimited, manageable world. For de Certeau, "tactics" refers to the set of practices performed by subjects upon and within these controlled fields: I call a "tactic," on the other hand, a calculus which cannot count on a "proper" (a spatial or institutional localization), nor thus on a bor- derline distinguishing the other as a visible totality. The place of a tactic belongs to the other. A tactic insinuates itself into the other's place, fragmentarily, without taking it over in its entirety, without being able to keep it at a distance.29 A tactic is equivalent to a speech act, which "is at the same time a use of language and an operation performed on it."3O It is temporal, a trajectory across the spaces of strategic control. If the Disney empire is a strategic space, then it is one that seems particularly susceptible to the trickster tactics of its visitors. When Disneyland opened, its designers waited to see where people actually walked before the layout of paths and park areas was finalized. The parks actually assimilate the tactical trajectories of its visitors, returning them in the form of strategies. Walking across the grass loses its subversive appeal-it's easier and more efficient to keep to the walkways. Subversion is rendered pointless or even, as in the case of the infamous Autopia, impossible. Thus, what one finds at Disneyland, or Disney World, are simulations of tactics: simulations of the derive, that aimless traversal of the complexities of urban space so cherished by the Situationists; and simulations of walking, in the specific sense of inscribing oneself upon the territories of strategic power.

This space is unique in that it impedes the tactical enunciations characteristic of everyday life while remaining an unfail- ingly popular vacation destination. 8. Radiant Cities The World of Motion ride at EPCOT Center (presented by General Mo- tors) concludes with a large model of a future city replete with gleaming white spires, pneumatic transport, hovercars, and an overall expansiveness that never, ever sprawls. The resemblance of this metropolis to GM's Futurama, that de- lightful city of the future (1960!) from the 1939 World's Fair, is obvious. A vision of the future still survives at EPCOT Center, then, based on central management, urban planning, and continuing technological progress. Disney World becomes a final haven for a purely technocratic projection of the future-the last bastion of instrumental reason (a "Futurama-induced admin- istrative competence," as novelist Richard Powers put it).31 Perhaps Disneyland/World is Radiant City. Le Corbusier's urban dream- scape represented the apotheosis of his concern with centralized management. The corporation was unfit to organize the public realm on its own. Neither was government. The "hierarchy of administration has replaced the state.""32 The zones of Radiant City constitute a geometry of instrumental reason-the ra- tionality of design transcending the competing economic ideologies of capitalism and communism. Like Disneyland, the Radiant City enshrined a "value-neutral" dedication to the technologies of rationalism. Robert Fishman uses terms that strongly suggest the now-mythic role of Walt Disney himself: Le Corbusier's concept of the planner combines two distinct images. One is the planner as scientist, surgeon, "technician"-the man of reason, a disinterested lover of humanity who studies the problems of the city, formulates clear solutions, and carries them out with an unswerving will. The second is the planner as artist, the isolated man of vision whose insights are the most profound record of his nation's spiritual life.33 In the comic book Mr. X, the designer of Somnopolis, a/k/a Radiant City, returns to destroy his corrupted creation. The city had been designed through psychetecture (an appropriation of the Situationists' psycho-geography?), but his 31. Richard Powers, Prisoner's Dilemma (New York: Collier Books, 1988), p. 83. 32.

The flat, dark artwork illustrates an urbanism of competing anachronisms where no two clocks agree, figures fling themselves to the ground below, and humans and robots coexist in a perpetual ennui. The architect, Walter Eichmann, is devastated, but others criticize his obsession: "You became one of those robots that you hated. You became a machine ... You became the city, Walter!"34 Central planning is advanced as an outmoded vehicle of megalomaniacal control, a misguided attempt to impose order on a chaotic, surreal existence. Radiant City is the dream, but Somnopolis represents the worst nightmares of Le Corbusier and Disney. Postmodernism usually rejects these master-narratives of centralized power. 34. Further, the character's name, Walter Eichmann, may be an allusion to Walter E. Disney. See Jaime Hernandez, et al., The Return of Mr. X (Fullerton, CA: Graphitti Designs, 1986), p. 61.

Cyberpunks and Hippie-Hackers Cyberpunk's resistance to the authoritarian mythos of Radiant City has been noted. Bodies in cyberpunk fiction and performance are invested in tech- nology at street/skin level. "For the cyberpunks," author/editor Bruce Sterling writes, "technology is visceral. . . . it is pervasive, utterly intimate . . . under our skin; often, inside our minds."35 In gentler language, cyberpunk is "about how our increasingly intimate feedback relationship with the technosphere we are creating has been, is, and will be altering our definition of what it means to be human itself."36 The body is inscribed and defined as it is paradoxically extended and delimited by these pervasive, invasive technologies. It is a matter of interface. Drawing from the work of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, Steven Jobs and the engineers at Apple Computer designed their Macintosh for maximum user-friendliness. Alienating keyboard commands were replaced by an intui- tively based system: point, click, access.37 The goal was to empower the individ- ual against the forces of central control.

Personal computing with a friendly interface was "why 1984 won't be like 1984." Toffler: "Instead of merely receiving our mental model of reality, we are now compelled to invent it and continually reinvent it. This places an enormous burden on us. But it also leads toward greater individuality, a demassification of personality as well as culture."" Telematic power would be anticorporate, decentralized, personal: such was the mythos.39 Thus, in the 1980s, two techno-myths arise: cyberpunk and hippie-hacker.40 Both are opposed to technocratic mythologies of centralized control, but while hippie-hacker substitutes an ethos of personal control and individual empow- erment, cyberpunk enacts the end of controls in its depiction of a world where technology circulates more or less freely and even has its own agenda, as in Neuromancer. Baudrillard, whose prose aspires to the condition of science fiction, is quintessential cyberpunk, while the Media Lab at MIT preserves the hippie- hacker ambition. Both acknowledge our inevitable imbrication in the new state of things, what Toffler has called "blip culture." The comforts of Disneyland and Disney World reveal a paradox of control by presenting the highest degree of user-friendliness in a human-technology interface while situating it within a massively centralized apparatus. 10. Terminal Theme Park Scientific American describes the cutting edge of new interface technologies in terms familiar to students of cinema-as a quest for realism. Brainstorm notwithstanding, however, cinema has nothing to rival the virtual reality systems of contemporary electronics. One NASA system, designed by VPL Laboratories, features a head-mounted apparatus using two color monitors (Eyephones) to create an analogue of depth perception through a simulated parallax. Sensors respond to head (and even eye) movement: "the user can enjoy the illusion of scanning an artificial panorama as he turns his head."4' With the addition of the Dataglove, which translates hand movements into electric signals, the user can grasp and manipulate the objects in the virtual environment.42 Voice rec- ognition completes the interface, and the user can thus handle "objects" in the 38.

For Timothy Leary, this virtual realm is the ultimate way to "tune in": according to one of the developers, "the computer literally knows where your head's at."43 To be installed into such an apparatus would be to exist on two planes simultaneously: while one's objective body would remain in the real world, one's phenomenal body would be projected into the terminal reality. Sterling observes: "Eighties tech sticks to the skin."44 To the skin and under the skin-Marvin Minsky, cofounder of MIT's Artificial Intelli- gence Laboratory, muses about wires inserted into the nerves that will allow Dataglove users the sensation of touch. The narrative strategies of the Disney worlds constitute another kind of virtual reality system, one which is largely conditioned by the narrative strategies that move guests through a technologically informed yet fundamentally con- servative and historically bound vision of "the future."45 At the same time, however, the theme parks are remarkably effective, albeit less explicit, visible projections of terminal space. Disneyland/World is a retro-future, a narrative, a Radiant City, but it is also a gigantic piece of installation art that spatializes the structures of a computer system. Each of the rides and attractions-files- are gathered into the subdivi- sions of the different Lands-folders. "Utilities" punctuate the array in the form of food and service kiosks. The pervasive transportation systems (mono- rail, horse-carriage, railroad, paddleboat, double-decker bus, WEDway People Mover) that shuttle the "guests"/users from function to function form an ex- tremely efficient operating system. All the technology remains hidden behind the tropical plants and architectural facades of the attractions, just as the ubiq- uitous beige shell of the personal computer disguises the micro-circuitry within. Finally, the blips being processed and circulated within this cybernetic paraspace-are us. The computer becomes a site of bodily habitation and experience in the theme parks-a technological interface so effective that most users are unaware of the interface at all. In its structure and geography, EPCOT easily suggests a spatialization of its own computerized functions, while cyberpunk's defining trope has been its own representation of the nonphysical, electronic spaces of the terminal realm, as prefigured by the 1982 film TRON (Steven Lisberger, a Disney production). TRON used vector and raster graphic programs to dramatize its cybernetic arenas, as designed by Syd (Blade Runner) Mead and the comic book artist Moebius (Jean Giraud). In this saga of an evil corporate takeover of a small individualistic computer company, a battle fought largely in terminal space, one 43.

Telotte for this concise restatement of my position.</page><page sequence="20">74 OCTOBER sees a collision of cyberpunk and hippie-hacker formations.46 The film also extends the historical relation between cinema and emergent technology. The motion picture camera has been invariably attached to subjective vision, but equally pervasive has been the linking of cinematic vision to new technologies.47 In Rend Clair's Paris Qui Dort, the camera, mounted on the elevator of the Eiffel Tower, demonstrates the intricacy of that monument to modernity as nothing else could, while Eisenstein's appropriation of a factory conveyor in Strike (1925) creates a space at once phenomenal and polemical.48 The cinema has thus produced coincident analogues of subjective interiority and technological exteriority. Cinema is a cyborg apparatus-part human, part machine. When Christian Metz declares that the fundamental identification that the spectator has is "with the camera," the historical significance of this ought to be understood: the "double movement" of projection and introjection, presented by Metz in primarily phenomenological terms,49 can clearly be seen in terms of the projection of a purposive human consciousness, but the introjection is of a particularly technologized space-a space that the camera mediates and assimilates to the terms of human vision. The crisis of the subject in postmodern electronic space, then, is a crisis frequently represented in terms of an ambig- uous and shifting vision, which may or may not be subjective.50 TRON oscillates between the familiar, character-oriented subjectivity of "classical" Hollywood cinema and the terminal identity generated by the hyper- bolic trajectories of a computer-simulated camera position. Here there are no literal point-of-view structures. "Camera" movement, simulated by the comput- er's graphics capability, is partly tied to vehicular movement, but is also some- what autonomous, swinging from high angles to low in a giddy display of its own cybernetic power. TRON not only constitutes an early narrative about virtual reality, it also provides a taste of the VR experience in which the camera finally serves to give the viewer a place in this computerized world, a place defined almost solely in terms of spatial penetration and kinetic achievement. 46. The film, released at a time of well-publicized transition at Disney Studios, is also unmistakably reflexive, down to the benign programmer/founder named Walter whose spirit finally "animates" the computer world with warm colors. 47. See films by Mlies, Keaton, Clair, Vertov, Kubrick, and Cronenberg for examples of this tendency. 48. On Clair's entirely reflexive treatment of technology, see Annette Michelson's excellent "Dr. Crase and Mr. Clair," October 11 (Winter 1979), pp. 31-53.

Docile Bodies Margaret King has argued that Disneyland presents "traditional values in a futuristic form." She may, however, have missed a more interesting aspect: the strategic narratives of the park prepare its "guests" for the future, and for the technologies to come, by grounding them in heavily traditional forms. The sophistication of the Audio-Animatrons is used to present singing bears and presidential simulacra; anthropomorphism is as prevalent as in any Disney film, and the narrative telos of the architecture and rides further serves to acclimate the subjects to the technologies around them. The entrance to the park is a crucial part of this process: "Main Street is not an end in itself but the entryway into other less familiar realms.""5 Recalling the above discussion of Disney World as Disney mall, Anne Friedberg has noted that "the mall creates a nostalgic image of town center as a clean, legible, safe place," and this is an image fostered even more hyperbolically by Main Street, U.S.A.52 The narrative process of technological accommodation is heightened in Future World, where the rides narrate the histories of the technologies of communication, transportation, electricity, and energy. The "pre-shows" include tricked-up industrial films for such companies as United Technologies, Exxon, and General Electric (connec- tions to the defense industry remain unstressed), while the shows feature the more traditionally entertaining Audio-Animatrons to illustrate the technological histories. But the rides do more than narrate. The combination of simulation and transportation seems an urgent part of the agenda. The body is put in motion in Disneyland-real movement of the subject's actual body occurs. Inevitably, however, this is supplemented by a further, simulated kinesis. The wraparound movie screens inevitably feature helicopter drops into the Grand Canyon (hand- rails are provided for queasy participants). The Carousel of Progress (GE) rotates its audience around a series of Audio-Animated historical tableaux, a variation upon the nineteenth-century form of the diorama. The Disney version, here and elsewhere, transforms the real spatial movement of the spectator into a simulated temporal trajectory. Further kinetic play is encountered in the nar- ratively conservative Horizons, as the four-person vehicle moves laterally across an enormous IMAX screen. As a whirling molecular shape rotates outward to apparently engulf the visitors, the car tilts against the direction of the vortex. The kinesthesia is intense and effective, enhanced (as in Hale's Tours) by the "horizon" of the vehicle. The World of Motion propels its cars through a tunnel of frantically surging, projected images which includes the vertiginous passage into cyberspace originally used in TRON. In the meantime, artificial breezes, sounds, and even smells extend the sensory address (the Universe of Energy's 51. Richard V.

Paul Virilio, confronted with the hypercinematic experience of Omnimax, notes that "we can no longer separate film from auditorium."53 How much more true at Disney World, as the "audi- torium" of George Lucas's Star Tours bucks and tilts to augment the onscreen action (the audience is seated in a flight simulator)!54 Tom Gunning has asserted that such prototypical technological attractions as Hale's tours gave "a reassuring context to this experience .... The desire to provide a place for the spectator related to the movement within the spectacle reveals the enjoyable anxiety the audience felt before the illusion of motion."55 Lynne Kirby notes that this anxiety is hardly innocent, and she has convincingly argued that Hale's Tours was a symptomatic response to an urban-induced "hysteria," and that the simulated transport served to equip its audience with an illusion of mastery over, or at least accommodation to, the mighty techno- logical forces which were being increasingly deployed. Kirby refers to Walter Benjamin on the role of cinema in a dramatically technologized world: The film is the art form that is in keeping with the increased threat to his life which modern man has to face. Man's need to expose himself to shock effects is his adjustment to the dangers threatening him. The film corresponds to profound changes in the apperceptive apparatus.56 The same is true for the hypercinematic simulations of Tomorrowland and Future World.57 A catharsis of technological breakdown is humorously, kineti- cally present in Star Tours, the most popular ride these days, in which your robot pilot malfunctions and sends you careening through space. Kinesis is thus fundamentally bound to narrative, from Hale's Tours to Star Tours. The conjunction of space and story is similarly, although less evi- dently, played through in science fiction. Cyberpunk acknowledges the su- percession of individual bodily experience in its hyperbolic, overdetermined prose, but ultimately the traditional operations of narrative firmly assert them- 53.

The decentering of the human subject performed by cyberpunk in its presentation of these other spaces existing beyond human intervention is under- mined by the transformation of these spaces into arenas of dramatic action. Cyberspace is entered by the cyberspace cowboys, and thus human will and determination are brought to bear upon this terminal realm. At its best, a symbiosis is proposed, but in practice the final recentering of the human subject within the cybernetic cosmology is beyond dispute. 12. Terminal Flesh While Disney produces a simulation of tactical resistance, cyberpunk still engages in tactical warfare. Both theme park and cyberpunk are concerned with what de Certeau calls "the status of the individual in technical systems," as "the involvement of the subject diminishes in proportion to the technocratic expansion of these systems." The subject, increasingly unable to control these proliferating structures, "can henceforth only try to outwit them, to pull tricks on them, to rediscover, within an electonicized and computerized megalopolis, the 'art' of the hunters and rural folk of earlier days.""58 These are uncanny statements when juxtaposed with Neuromancer, a work quite evidently concerned with "the status of the individual in technical systems." Cyberpunk is a narrative of tactics--corporations and military control the space of cyberspace, while outlaw c-space cowboys revel in their outsider status, becoming kinetic infiltrators, deceptors, and tricksters. At EPCOT Center the visitors are also kineticized outsiders, but this time only as tourists who are, literally, just along for the ride. What finally occurs through all of the intensification of sensory experience on the rides of Tomorrowland and Future World is nothing less than an in- scription of the body, on the body. These journeys into technologically complex zones ultimately serve to guarantee the continuing presence and relevance of the subject. You have a body, the rides announce, you exist. The body, and thus the subject, penetrates these impossible spaces, finally to merge with them in a state of kinetic, sensory pleasure. The visitor is thus projected into the datascape, and is incorporated by the technology quite as fully as the cyberspace cowboys of Neuromancer. The inscription on the body announces the human-machine in- terface, and technology thereby creates the conditions for its own acceptance. Merleau-Ponty has written of the complex interface between world and subject, and of the fundamental physiognomic process whereby the "subject" is created at all: The normal subject penetrates into the object by perception, assimi- lating its structure into his substance, and through this body the object 58. Certeau, Practice of Everyday Life, p. xxiii.</page><page sequence="24">78 OCTOBER directly regulates his movements. This subject-object dialogue, this drawing together, by the subject, of the meaning diffused through the object, and, by the object, of the subject's intentions-a process which is physiognomic perception-arranges round the subject a world which speaks to him of himself, and gives his own thoughts their place in the world.59 What Disney and the cyberpunks permit, then, is nothing less than the process of "physiognomic perception" amidst the previously inconceivable spaces of the telematic era. This engagement with a new world produces a new subjectivity, a new "terminal identity." Despite its conservative narration of a benign, centralized technocracy, then, the Disney version is finally not so different from cyberpunk fiction in its presentation of a technological and overwhelming spatiality which is physically penetrated by the body of the subject. Future World dazzles its guests with dislocating other spaces in the manner of science-fiction text. And within such a narrativization, now augmented by a bodily address, these rides locate and center the human, further reifying the perceived power of the subject. The popularity of these theme parks bespeaks the massive need for reassurance and resituation which many continue to feel in the face of the invisible and hence unknowable spaces of terminal culture. The parks present technology with a Mouse's face. All this occurs within the most protected, centralized, and technocratic of environments: complex spaces that raise pertinent questions for the understand- ing of techno-cultural formations; spaces that present both a traditionally grounded humanization of technology and the disembodying postmodern ex- perience of a technological sublime; an installation which is the most extensive and explicit of strategic spaces, but which assimilates visitor tactics in the process of building a technological interface. Here Baudrillard's most euphoric and despairing pronouncements both find continual figuration. Safely cocooned by the implosive architecture of the parks, the subject is itself assimilated and finally reconstituted by the extensive narrational telos, the evocation of a total- izing and benevolent urban experience, the hypercinematic engagement with a technologized phenomenology, the commodification of Being, and by the stra- tegic usurpation of the everyday tactics of individual survival. In Future World, technology indeed seems to possess its own agenda and engages in an endless process of writing itself on the bodies of its "guests" while permitting them illusions of assimilation and mastery--illusions that are, at the same time, real bodily experiences. The enormous paraspatial and cybernetic realm of Walt Disney World constitutes a massive and self-regulating interface in which ter- minal space is rendered visible, malleable, and perhaps even adorable. 59.
