<plain_text><page sequence="1">attributed to the linguistic and nonlinguistic behavior of persons (his smile is an expression of contentment), refers to an intentional state of the person-an attitude, belief, feeling or expectation. Only intentional states are subject to expression. These states are characterized by their 'aboutness', which is indicated by the use of prepositional locutions. The intentional state of a person is partially constituted by the varieties of behavior, linguistic and nonlinguistic, in terms of which it is appropriately ex- pressed; and, likewise in the case of works of art, the global expressiveness that is ascribed to them is a resultant, constituted by such nonexpressive properties as pitch, color, shape, balance and contrast, which they also possess. The expressive properties of a work of art are 'revealed' through the 'presentation' of nonexpressive properties. Tormey's analysis of expression-expressiveness identifies him squarely in the tradition of Anglo-American Ordinary Language philosophy, a school whose forte is largely critical, rather than constructive. The butt of Tormey's criticism is the classical 'expression theory' of art, whose defenders, ranging from Collingwood to Ducasse to Dewey, agree, with some variations, that a work of art is an 'embodiment' of a feeling or experience undergone by an artist and 'put there' by him. As Arthur Danto says in the introduction to the book, expression theorists hold that works of art are the 'exudates' of souls. Tormey rejects this view both as a theory of art and as an adequate explanation of what expression is. His book makes a small contribution to the replacement of tradi- tional expression theory. He offers a model: Expression Expressiveness Person as Work of art and he makes some moves in the direction of exploring the systemic implications of that model. The logic of expressiveness must have some analogues with the logic of expression. But there are also differences, and above all, they are causally independent of one another. But Tormey does not plumb the depths of his own model-a pity, for it is an interesting one. What further insights into art or, for that matter, into persons, might be derived from this analogy ? Both the products of an act of creation, they leave the hand of their maker, existentially unique, to be shaped and completed by their own interaction with the world to whose shaping they also contribute. Both persons and works of art lead a life of their own, inde- pendent of the predestination of the shaping author. Both have the capacity to elicit love, to be companions and to impose obligations, to reward cherishing and to submit to exploitation. To explore such parallels would surely go beyond the rigid restrictions to which Tormey has confined his study but it might render the book a richer source of insight to artists, teachers and nonphilosophers to whom the logic of expression is less challenging than is the practice of it. To critics Tormey offers the encouragement that, while the expressive properties of a work of art are revealed by way of the nonexpressive ones, the mediation is a non- mechanical one. The inherent ambiguity of works of art is, in fact, so rich that no single expressive constellation is exclusively warranted by a given set of nonexpressive features and hence a wide latitude of critical disagreement is permissable and welcome. Beyond this, Tormey proposes no practical counsel to artists and teachers, no guide to art historians and appre- ciators, no general theory of art. Those who will be most delighted by Tormey's book are the philosophers and logicians whose experience of the arts, as well as that of persons, tends to be predominantly indirect. By contrast, Sircello's study is much more generous in scope, both in the range of modalities of expression that the author explores and in the expanse of the philosophical and cultural tradition from which he draws. As a con- sequence, the book is less restrictively an analysis of a neatly delineated aesthetic 'problem' but is rather an alternative route to the study of fundamental philosophy. As Sircello announces in the preface, the study of the concepts of expression moved him centripetally from the aesthetic periphery of philosophy to its core. In modern terms that core has been designated the 'philosophy of mind' but the book may be understood more traditionally as a work in such categories as metaphysics, epistemology or ethics. And those passages that are most speculative- e.g., those exploring the nature of formal causality or of the self-are among the most provocative. Like Tormey, but less categorically, Sircello rejects the classic expression theory of art (Dewey, Ducasse, Langer et al.). But he is also critical of the modern detractors of that theory, among whose number Tormey must also be counted. Sircello groups these critics together as holding the 'Canonical Position', canonized by John Hospers, with Beardsley and Bowsma as its spokesmen. According to these philosophers, expression is present in art only inasmuch as certain anthropomorphic qualities-sadness, gaiety, delicacy and the like-are attributed to it by the application of a peculiar logic. Sircello finds this view simpleminded and inadequate. The bulk of his book is concerned with elaborating and displaying the varieties of things that may be expressed by way of a rich assortment of modes of expression. Art is surely one of the most effective and rewarding of these modes but scientific treatises, style of dress and deportment, as well as work and play, are also ways of expressing ideas, global emotive qualities and objective properties of the world, and even means to the expression of self, a notion that Sircello discusses briefly and rather crudely in the final chapter. Despite the breadth of his purview, Sircello is analytic- ally precise. He examines with painstaking care the niceties of resemblance and discrimination between expression and showing, revealing and making manifest, being a sign or a symptom, being an expression of F, or of someone's F, and a host of other detailed points of comparison. These examinations are relieved of their potential tedium and pedantry by their delightfully original illustrations. One can imagine the author chortling with friends and colleagues over the complex fantasies that his labyrinthine mind has invented. The book as a whole is a pleasure to read. More than a compendium of analytical insights, it is a sustained argument in defense of a single thesis, which is stated, reiterated and qualified with loving attention to clarity, distinctness and completeness. Sircello identifies his position as 'romantic', even as 'outrageous', but it is reservedly so, for he repudiates any form of mystery- mongering or sentimentalizing of private, inaccessible states of interiority. Sircello's romanticism lies in the belief that the mind is creative, not merely reflective. In so far as anything is expressible, he says-a person's attitude, feeling, mood, belief or whatever-it shows as a characteristic pattern of the behavior (including artistic acts) of that person and it is causally efficacious in pro- ducing that behavior which is its expression. Because the book itself is the expression of a full-bodied and humane intelligence, it should reward the study not only of philosophers, to whom, like Tormey's book, it is chiefly addressed but also of critics, teachers and practising artists. Literature as Art: A Reader. R. Britsch, T. Britsch, G. W. Bell, eds. Brigham Young Univ. Press, Provo, Utah, 1972. 743 pp., illus. $8.95. Reviewed by Annette Gadney* Literature as Art is an odd title: in the broadest sense, who would think to question that literature is art? Or is it a matter of literature that in some way masquerades as art ? Calligrams, collages, conceptual art etc.? But no, this weighty anthology has both more modest and more grandiose aims. The compilers claim that it is intended mainly as a companion volume to student texts in 'humanities courses' and specifically for those in which *Glebe House, Wendy, Royston, Herts., England. 170 Books</page><page sequence="2">Preface: 'Here, then, are examples of the art of literature from Homer to Yevtushenko'. Leonardo: A Study in Chronology and Style. By Carlo Pedretti. Univ. California Press, Berkeley, Calif., 1973. 192 pp., illus. $10.95. Reviewed by Raymond S. Stites* In this beautifully designed and abundantly illustrated book, Pedretti reveals his own inner motives which, in former years, led him to a number of significant dis- coveries concerning the life and works of Leonardo da Vinci. His aim, as he proclaims it in his first paragraph, is to provide 'a lighthearted journey through the delightful complexity of Leonardo's life and thought . . .'. Then, copying the words of his friend and mentor Lord Clark, he avers that 'I am not writing a concluding statement, but simply my views, personal as ever, on a number of problems . . .'. Despite the fact that Pedretti seems thus to be warning that he is not to be taken too seriously, the book is too stimulating and too full of arguable material to be dismissed with a superficial review. At the same time it is too erroneous in some of its conclusions to be recommended to the beginner in Leonardo studies without a warning. For example, in his first chapter, entitled 'The River' Pedretti suggests that he has discovered the mainspring of Leonardo's creativity in a fear complex brought about by a cyclonic disturbance in the Arno river valley in his fourth year. In the artist's declining years, this led to the creation of at least nineteen drawings showing the cata- clysm whose traumatic image still haunted Leonardo. The suggestion is 'too simplistic'. What Pedretti overlooks is that the Bible, with its Flood story, was well known to Leonardo da Vinci and, as a child, he must have heard the village priest hold forth on the subject. Also there was the prophecy of impending doom not only in Revelations but also in the pages of Dante. This greatly affected the life work of his friend Botticelli. Further, some of Leonardo's notes on the subject almost exactly repeat passages in a Latin poem by Statius, which Leonardo may have intended to illustrate, as Botticelli was then illustrating Dante's Inferno. Even more obvious, is the fact that Pedretti does not consider the effect on Leonardo of the fact that Cosimo de' Medici, years before Leonardo's birth, had formed a company to harness the Arno's floods, thus providing a viable canal to Pisa. As the son of an alert corporation lawyer anxious to see the youth engage in financial productive labor, the young Leonardo could have been forced into a career as a flood-control engineer by his demanding parent. Throughout the book, the author's oversight of such commercial motives seems most remarkable because he was the first to open the way to a refutation of the super- ficial judgment, used by the orthodox followers of Freud, who maintain that most of Leonardo's work as a mechanic and engineer was 'witless and unproductive'. Several years ago, Pedretti was able to demonstrate that the Rucellai family paid Leonardo for a water pump. This discovery marked a most significant new step in the Leonardo story! Through the rest of the chapters dealing with 'The Fiction, Hercules, Leda and Bacchus' the author attempts to add to the legend of Leonardo his own insights by finding new motives for the creation of each work of art. In Chapter IV he deals with the figure of Leda. Earlier he had set forth this hypothesis: 'Leonardo's sense of form was to find a majestic expression in the female nude. Classically built up in space along a spiral line, like the figura serpentina of the coming generation of Mannerists, Leda was shaping in Leonardo's mind around 1505, at the time of his extensive studies of the flight of birds. He had come to identify every action in nature as occurring along spiral lines: the birds ascending in the sky or Leda rising 'emphasis is placed on the artistic or aesthetic aspects of experience'. So it is an anthology of literature that treats in some way the process of creating, a modest enough claim, but it also implicitly claims to illuminate this process and this puts a strange didactic straitjacket on the range of literature represented. In the end one feels that literature is being examined as a curious human deviation by some well-meaning and utterly interested alien creature, the better to be categorized, labelled and tucked away. There are seven categories, from Classicism to The Twentieth Century, and the text is interpolated with black and white illustrations of works of art from a bust of Homer to Rauschenberg's 'Monogram'. It may be the Mormon connections of the University that have made the selection of extracts very conservative or it may even be that one eye has had to be kept on American syllabus requirements. Thus, Willa Cather but no Proust, an astonishing omission for a tone including the whole of Ibsen's The Master Builder and purporting to deal with the 'aesthetic aspects of experience'. Nothing from that most painterly poet, Apollinaire, and nothing in the 'Realist' section from Zola. It is disappointing to see vigorous contemporary American prose writers such as Nabokov, Mailer, Bellow and Malamud ignored in favour of the safe Irving Stone and Robert Lowell. But what of the didactic purpose, the scanning of the nature of artistic experience? The picture that emerges is vaguely depressing, stressing as it does the problematic side: the difficulties of the artist's relationship to life, the humiliation of the artistic vocation. There is a grotesque and one-sided tale by Thomas Mann about a fawning lawyer's public humiliation by his superficial wife and lover, which does less than justice to Mann's subtle lifelong preoccupation with the yearnings and conflicts between artist and 'bourgeois'. The snowstorm scene in The Magic Mountain, and its aftermath, would have been far more telling. St. Augustine is represented by a passage deploring his youth, misspent studying The Aeneid and similar, now decreed as 'poetic fiction' leading minds from the straight religious path. Oscar Wilde's contribution is the preface to Dorian Grey, ending: 'All art is quite useless.' The last four works in the book reflect either a legitimate question- ing of the role of art or the prevailing mood of slightly melancholy cynicism, depending on one's viewpoint. There is a poem by Ferlinghetti, picturing the artist as a 'little charleychaplin man/who may or not catch/(Beauty's) fair eternal form',/then Yevtuskenko's well-known but weak 'Babii Yar' (I seem to be/Anne Frank/transparent/as a branch in April). In Voznesensky's 'Parabolic Ballad' the artist wishes to describe a parabola in spite of jibes but then comes political oppression and: 'Galoshes sink in the Siberian spring . .. Perhaps the straight line is shorter after all?' The final image one is left with is Rauschenberg's tongue in cheek model of a ram stuck through a tyre. The whole concept of such a book is questionable. It does not point to sources or further reading, indeed the bibliographical references are scant, no dates are given for the extracts and so no follow-up in libraries, a key to independent thinking, is expected. Everything that is not in standard mid-Atlantic English is translated-even Chaucer and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. All the work-and there must have been a lot of it-has been done to make the package uniform and easily digestible for the student. The compilers might object that this is meant as a 'companion' only, for 'numerous experiences in the visual arts . and in music should be provided for the student in the basic text and through the use of slides, films, recordings and so forth.' This sentence does not bear too close an examination; but it is indeed odd to recommend only second-hand 'experience' of art and even then these diluted 'experiences' to be 'provided' for the student. Most artists will want to discover literature and its links with their art in a library rather than in a nutshell. But for those who do not, in the memorable words of the from her kneeling position.
