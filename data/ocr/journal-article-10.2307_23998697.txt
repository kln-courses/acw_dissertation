<plain_text><page sequence="1">S. B. BARNES and R. G. A. DOLBY The Scientific Ethos . A deviant viewpoint The study of science and scientists has attracted sociologists, to any significant extent, only in the last quarter of a century. The earliest papers of any importance in the field are probably those of Robert Merton, written in the late 1930's and early 1940's; Merton's ideas have been extremely influential with all subsequent contributors and it is probably no exaggeration to state that the literature of the subject has been overwhelmingly concerned with the development and extension of Merton's original insights. Certainly in America the work of Barber, Storer, Marcson, Hagstrom, Kornhauser and Shils would seem to justify this contention. In Britain, the sociology of science is not studied as much, but the work of Cotgrove, although by no means 'following' Merton, freely acknowledges his influence. Those influenced by Merton may be approximately characterised as a school of thought in sociology. Their basic sociological orien tation is well known, involving functional analyses of societies and social institutions, and the treatment of social or institutional values as given determinants of behaviour. This approach is controversial, leading to philosophical difficulties at least as assessed by rival schools. With the belief that criticism from outside can be far more stimulating than self-preserving comments from within, we shall attempt to reveal the inadequacies of this approach in the context of the sociol ogy of science. The substance of the approach is that science is treated as a social institution with an ethos of norms and values. The ethos of science is that effectively toned complex of values and norms which is held to be binding on the man of science. The norms are expressed in the forms of prescriptions, proscriptions, preferences and permissions. They are legitimatized in terms of institutional values. These imperatives, transmitted by precept and example and reinforced by sanctions are in varying degrees internalised by the scien tist, thus fashioning his scientific conscience or, if one prefers the latter day phrase, his superego. Although the ethos of science has not been codified, it can be inferred Archiv, turop. sociol., XI (1970), 3-35.</page><page sequence="2">S. B. BARNES and R.G.A. DOLBY from the moral consensus of scientists as expressed in use and wont, in countless writings on the scientific spirit and in moral indignation directed toward contra ventions of the ethos (i). Merton then defines four institutional imperatives or values which compromise the ethos of modern science. Universalistn. Universalism finds immediate expression in the canon that truth claims, whatever their source, are to be subjected to pre-established impersonal criteria, consonant with observation and with previously confirmed knowledge (2). Communism. The substantive findings of science are a product of social collaboration and are assigned to the community. They constitute a common heritage in which the equity of the individual producer is severely limited. An eponymous law or theory does not enter into the exclusive possession of the discoverer and his heirs, nor do the mores bestow on them special rights of use and disposition (3). Disinterestedness. [...] a distinctive pattern of institutional control of a wide range of motives which characterise the behaviour of scientists [...] once the institution enjoins disinterested activity, it is to the interest of scientists to conform on pain of sanctions and, in so far as the norm has been internalised, on pain of psychological conflict (4). Unfortunately, Merton gives little further explanation of disinte restedness. Presumably he means that the scientist is expected to perform his work without having any reward in view, whether finan cial, emotional or social. Such rewards may be received, but work should not be specifically directed towards obtaining them. Storer (5), in developing Merton's typology, takes disinterestedness to refer mainly to financial rewards, and introduces the imperative of "emotional neutrality" enjoining the scientist to remain detached from his work emotionally so as to be able to evaluate it dispassionately; in this he follows Barber (6). Organised Scepticism. The suspension of judgement until "the facts are at hand" and the detached scru tiny of beliefs in terms of empirical and logical criteria have periodically involved science in conflict with other institutions. The scientific investigator does not preserve the cleavage between the sacred and the profane, between that which requires uncritical respect and that which can be objectively analysed (7). (1) R. K.

(7) Merton, op. cit. p. 560.</page><page sequence="3">THE SCIENTIFIC ETHOS A further characteristic of the ethos of science in Merton's account is its autonomy. Loss of autonomy threatens the institutional values of science and will be resisted by scientists. Merton presumably does not treat this as an independent imperative because he sees it merely as a means of defence for the other values, which characterise science as a social institution. Also to be distinguished from the institutional values are those imperatives identified by Merton as empiricism and rationality; these are to be regarded as methodological imperatives and for Merton the methodology of science is distinct from its institutional structure. Following Merton, Barber (8) treats the norm of rationality on a par with the other four imperatives. The way Merton characterises the imperatives of science is the result of a particular conception of the social mechanism of science. As an autonomous social activity, science depends on its practitioners exchanging information freely and without ulterior motive. As a method of producing knowledge, it is essential that all those involved should strive to share the same standards of judgement, and that individuals should refrain from committing themselves to belief until universally shared criteria can be shown to apply. Science is an autonomous activity efficiently generating indisputable knowledge shared by the whole scientific community. This image Merton codifies by his four imperatives, and studies by his functionalist methods. As an example of the evaluation of Merton's discussion of norms in the literature based on his work, we quote Storer: It is to the enduring credit of Robert K. Merton that he was able to conceptualise the norms of science, working presumably in part through intuition and testing his ideas against what scientists have said since the seventeenth century about their work and how scientists should behave. Certainly a large part of the work in sociol ogy of science today is based on Merton's description of these norms and the fact that his statement of them has continued to be used suggests that he cannot have been far wrong in identifying them as he did (9). This account of scientific activity is both pervasive and rich in empirical correlates. Here, very briefly are some of the areas in which the approach has been applied. i. The scientific revolution is seen as being related to new value attitudes, namely those implicit in ascetic Protestantism. "[...] the religious ethic which stemmed from Calvin promoted a state of mind and a value orientation which invited the pursuit of natural science" (10). (8) Barber, op. cit. pp. 32 sqq.

DOLBY The explanation is a development of the Weber thesis. Certain beliefs arose at a particular time, or at least became overwhelmingly more important during a particular period. These beliefs, embodying certain values, had, directly or indirectly, consequences in terms of human action; in this case an increase in empirical and rational activity. 2. The present institutionalised state of science is seen as func tional to the advancement of knowledge, and this is particularly so in the case of the autonomous academic community. It is the academic community which internalises the norms of science most strongly and plays the key role in maintaining them through the institution of science as a whole. 3. The patterns of recognition and reward in the academic world are interpreted in terms of the norms of communality and disinterest. 4. The industrial scientist is seen as occupying a position of potential conflict due to the incompatibility of the norms of science with those of industrial organisations. Empirical confirmation of this has been claimed by Marcson (11), Kornhauser (12) and others. 5. It is suggested that science will flourish most successfully in those societies whose dominant cultural values resemble its institu tional imperatives, i.e. in liberal-democratic rather than totalitarian societies (13). All these suggestions have been challenged: apart from the con tinuing controversy over the origins of the scientific revolution and the claim that the science of totalitarian countries must be necessarily inferior (to all intents abandoned after 1957), criticisms have followed two main lines. Those concerned with scientific change have doubted whether Merton's diagnosis, in terms of a constant normative structure substantially the same now as it was in the seventeenth century, merits even the status of an approximate working model; they doubt whether the manifest changes that have occurred within science can be dealt with in a functionalist framework (14). Others have felt that science is nothing like the homogenous institution that Merton implied. With regard to the latter criticism much supporting evidence is already to be found within the literature. Krohn (15) has pointed (11) S. Marcson, The Scientist in Ameri can Industry (New York, Harper, i960). (12) W. Kornhauser, Scientists in Indus try (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1963).

Transactions on Engineering Management EM-8 (1961), pp. 133-138.</page><page sequence="5">THE SCIENTIFIC ETHOS out how in modern society scientific work occurs in a wide variety of institutional settings and has presented evidence supporting the view that the relevant normative structures vary widely among these settings. Recent studies in Britain by Box and Cotgrove (16) support this general position by providing strong evidence that, of scientists entering industry from university, the great majority regard their work instrumentally and readily adapt to the values of business. Meanwhile the tendency of the 'Mertonian school' has been increasing ly to concentrate upon 'pure' science in its diagnoses and to stress, in varying degrees, the great importance of this area to science as a whole; viz. Storer: The traditional norms will continue to be supported not only within the basic research 'suburbs' of the scientific metropolis but also throughout the entire metro polis because the prestige of these groups will make the norms important to it. However, the conditions under which the majority of scientists, those in applied research, must work will make the implementation of these norms more and more difficult for them, and the major conflict over norms will be felt by them rather than by the basic scientists. As a result, I would expect that a means will be developed by which a different set of norms more appropriate to the situations in which they are working may be legitimated for these scientists. The new normative structure, perhaps subsidiary to but still capable of existing side by side with the traditional one, will probably be similar to the professional ethics now characteristic of the legal and medical professions; it will focus more upon the attitudes appropriate to the application of specialised knowledge and less upon the ultimate value of the knowledge itself (17). It is our view that the practice of treating science as an homogenous institution typified by the pure research of the university will rapidly decline. What is more interesting is the adequacy of the Mertonian approach with respect to 'pure' science itself, and it is on this that we shall concentrate, our aim being to show that Merton has failed to identify a constant, specific, overriding normative structure within which this activity occurs. First it is necessary to note the three grounds upon which the existence of the normative structure is justified. Firstly, it is claimed, the norms can be discerned in "writings on the scientific spirit" and other utterances of scientists; secondly they are embedded in the behaviour of scientists and can be discerned as a pattern of positively sanctioned activities; thirdly they are theoretically necessary by virtue of their functional relationship to the institutional goal of science. We shall not consider the third claim, as it rests upon the theory of functionalism which has achieved no consensus within sociology. (i6) S. Box and S. Cotgrove, Scientific Identity, Occupational Selection and Role Strain, British Journal of Sociology, XVII (1966), pp. 20-28. (17) Stoker, op. cit. p. 165.</page><page sequence="6">S. B. BARNES and R.G.A. DOLBY And we shall make a distinction between 'professed' norms enjoined or celebrated in tract or speech, and 'statistical' norms observable as a pattern of positively sanctioned activity. Whereas it is statistical norms that are crucial to an understanding of ongoing scientific activity, the material Merton presents serves, at best, only to draw attention to professed norms. Professed norms may indeed be strong guides to action and as such correspond closely to statistical norms, on the other hand they may be directed mainly to out-groups in situations of justification or conflict and be of little practical use to the scientist in discriminating between alternative courses of action. In the light of this we shall frame our criticisms into three sections: 1. We shall argue that scepticism, rationality and universalism cannot represent statistical norms specific to science. 2. In the light of a brief historical account we shall argue that professed and statistical norms within science vary over time. 3. We shall critically consider Merton's description of scientific ambivalence, and here will stress the importance of the way in which the sociologist describes norms; different abstract descriptions of the same rule-governed behaviour can lead to strongly varying conclu sions. It is our view that the general orientation which starts by identi fying 'given' governing norms within science has resulted in neglect of processes by which normative structures have changed as the financial support, technological framework and esoteric content of scientific activity has itself changed. Scientific reception systems, communication patterns and property rights have varied both tempo rally and between different scientific sub-groups — and so accordingly have corresponding normative patterns. Moreover, to neglect these changes is no minor error; heterogeneity in normative structure and in esoteric belief systems is a crucially important factor in accounting for the rapid changes central to scientific progress. i. Universalism, Rationality, Scepticism, norms based upon a particular view of scientific activity. These norms represent attempts to describe institutional con straints upon the way the scientist thinks and acts with respect to the published results of his peers. They are based on the view that a specifically "scientific approach" exists common to the evaluative procedures of all scientists, and specific to them. They suggest that distinctive elements exist in all types of scientific investigation, that can be identified independently of the content of particular 8</page><page sequence="7">THE SCIENTIFIC ETHOS investigations. The test of this claim must be whether these norms provide distinctive general rules which discriminate between alterna tive courses of action for scientists ; we suggest that this is not so. Consider the norm of rationality : in our culture we tend to use the term 'rational' rather as we use the term 'correct', to recommend a particular course of action. "Be rational!" enjoins reference to a set of rules, rather than embodying a rule in itself. The sociologist must ask whether exhortations to rationality make reference to a known set of rules, and further, whether the scientist uses these exhortations in the sense common to his culture (in which case ratio nality cannot be a specific norm of science), or whether he possesses an esoteric, specifically scientific, conception of rationality expressible in an esoteric set of rules. Bernard Barber (18) in attempting to specify the rules of the scientist's rationality cites the rules of logic, but conformity to these is surely just a generally accepted standard within our society. Indeed we would argue that such rules must be normative in any culture as without common standards for nega tion, contradiction and discrimination, the use of language is impossi ble (19). We suggest that the notion of 'rationality' as a specific scientific norm be abandoned. One looks in vain for training or less formal socialisation processes designed to teach the scientist to "be rational"; rather it is assumed that he will operate 'rationally' with what he is taught, and his well intentioned errors are attributed to mistakes or lack of understanding, never to 'irrationality'. Universalism presents a similar difficulty to rationality. What society does not possess prior impersonal criteria for truth ? Anything distinctively 'scientific' must lie within the specific nature of the "impersonal criteria" used by scientists. Merton attempts to distin guish specifically scientific criteria for truth claims; he contrasts the requirement of scientists that truth claims be "consonant with observation" with criteria found in other parts of society or even within whole societies; criteria such as dogma or attributes of the person making the claims. This treatment is mistaken and rests upon a failure to distinguish between criteria of truth and indicators of truth. We would argue that when, for instance, a Nazi stated that non Aryan science was bad (20) he was making an empirical claim, not (i8) Barber, op. cit. pp. 32 sqq. (ig) S. Lukes, Some Problems about Rationality, European Journal of Sociology, VIII (1967), pp. 247 sqq. (20) Merton, Science and Democratic Social Structure, op. cit. p. 555.</page><page sequence="8">S. B. BARNES and R.G.A. DOLBY uttering a tautology. That is to say, he was using race as an indicator of bad science, which latter he defined in terms of the same criteria of truth as anyone else. He was making a mistake, not using a set of separate standards. The form of this behaviour is analogous to that of the scientist who scans the journals reading articles by 'big names' only, or who learns to avoid the work of certain known incompe tents. Scientists have indicators of truth like any other social group ; they will use the repute of other scientists and the numbers of them advocating a particular claim. And these indicators, unreliable though they occasionally are, may be preferred to such alternatives as race or nationality. But where scientists use "consonance with observation" as a criterion for the truth of those of their statements to which it can meaningfully refer, they apply a criterion common to the whole of their culture. This is precisely why the claims of organised science have produced such significant reactions within other social institutions. Finally, when we consider organised scepticism we must admit that a universal injunction to "reserve judgement until the facts are at hand" combines oddly with the fact that all scientific theories go beyond the knowledge on which they are based. Further, examina tions of scientific controversies show that typically scientists take sides between particular theories, often developing emotional attach ment to them, and arguing their merits with great vehemence and polemic skill. Illustrative of this are the debates in geology over 'Neptunism' versus 'Plutonism', the later 'catastrophism' versus 'uniformitarianism' and the disputes over evolution. In modern times one can cite the valence bond—molecular orbital controversy in chemistry, the debates surrounding the nature of light and the quantum theory, and the current debate in cosmology between steady-state and big-bang theorists. All of these are cases where insufficient evidence was available during much of the dispute and some ended with the creation of theories involving elements from both contending posi tions. Nor are these examples of 'deviant' behaviour; tenacious advocacy of theories by individual scientists generally brings reward within a scientific sub-group sufficient to outweigh sanctions from outside it. The scientist generally has a specific viewpoint which makes him sceptical of some results whilst uncritically accepting others; this is the norm. (In any event on logistic grounds alone universal scepticism would be out of the question even if it was desired). But this, unfortunately, is a description very widely appli cable: the fundamentalist Christian may accept the statements of 10</page><page sequence="9">THE SCIENTIFIC ETHOS his bible but he is likely to be extremely sceptical of anything contra dicting it. At best we can claim that scientists possess a distinctive pattern of scepticism. But what is this pattern? Again, whatever may be distinctive of science has slipped through the mesh of descrip tion. It seems clear that the preceding terms fail because they lack content. The scientist is seen as the possessor of data, techniques and theories with which he operates in a specifically scientific manner— one which can be abstracted and described independently of any specific activity. Merton's position resembles that of those philoso phers of science who attempt to describe a specific "scientific method". Such abstractions would certainly make science an easier subject of study from the outside—if they would work; in fact they invariably miss the distinctive features of scientific activity. If we contrast Merton's position with one taking full account of the content of scientific theories and procedures, its weaknesses can be further clarified. Such a position is found in the well known writings of Thomas Kuhn. Here scientists are described as working, for the most part, in consensus groups, basing their work on a shared paradigm. A paradigm is a fundamental scientific achievement, and one which includes both a theory and some exemplary applications to the results of experiment and observation. More important it is an open ended achievement, one which leaves all sorts of research still to be done. And finally it is an accepted achievement in the sense that it is received by a group whose members no longer try to rival it or to create alternatives to it (21). Kuhn, who bases his diagnosis on a series of case studies is able to show how the possessor of a paradigm discriminates between different courses of action or evaluation on the basis of it (22); here are specific, impersonal criteria of truth. Within scientific sociali sation processes one can discern readily enough processes of paradigm transmission where one looks in vain for the transmission of 'ration ality'. With the paradigm notion, too, one is able to delineate a pattern of scepticism— where scepticism increases as material conforms less to the expectations provided by a paradigm. Whatever one's final assessment of Kuhn's views may be, it is clear that his diagnosis succeeds in a way that Merton's does not, because it embraces the specific activities, theories and concepts of the scientist.

Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago, Univ. of Chicago Press, 1962), chaps Il-v. II</page><page sequence="10">S. B. BARNES and R.G.A. DOLBY It is noteworthy and scarcely surprising that the three norms discuss ed here have been the basis of very little further original work. Warren Hagstrom appears to have appreciated the need to demonstrate the existence of these norms in science but his choice of evidence is quite remarkable. He writes: The content of the texts, lectures and laboratory work presented in the course of higher education in the sciences integrates the general norms and values of science with a specific set of beliefs and techniques. Thomas S. Kuhn has aptly described this kind of education: [This quotation from Kuhn follows:] "Typically, the under graduate and graduate student of chemistry, physics, astronomy, geology, or biology acquires the substances of his field from books written especially for students. Until he is ready, or very nearly ready, to commence work on his own dissertation, he is neither asked to attempt trial research projects nor exposed to the immediate products of research done by others—to, that is, the professional communications that scientists write for each other. There are no collections of 'Readings' in the natural sciences. Nor is the science student encouraged to read the historical classics of his field—works in which he might discover other ways of regarding the problems discussed in his text, but in which he would also meet problems, concepts and standards of solution that his future profession has long since discarded and replaced. In contrast, the various texts that the student does encounter display different subject matters, rather than, as in many of the social sciences, exemplifying different approaches to a single problem field. Even books that compete for adoption in a single course differ mainly in level and in pedagogic detail, not in substance or concep tual structure. Last, but most important of all, is the characteristic technique of textbook presentation. Except in their occasional introductions, science textbooks do not describe the sorts of problems that the professional may be asked to solve and the variety of techniques available for their solution. Rather these books exhibit concrete problem-solutions that the profession has come to accept as paradigms, and they then ask the student, either with a pencil and paper or in the laboratory, to solve for himself problems very closely related both in method and substance to those which the text or accompanying lecture has led him through. Nothing could be better calculated to produce 'mental sets' or 'Einstellungen'. Only in their most elementary courses do other academic fields offer even a partial parallel" (23). One looks in vain in this lengthy passage for any faint suggestion of the presence of norms of universalism, scepticism or rationality— let alone for signs of their being 'integrated' with specific beliefs. Indeed, by itself, the passage represents scientific training as au thoritarian and dogmatic. But, if evidence for the existence of these norms is so difficult to produce, how did their existence come to be postulated ? The answer would appear to be that these norms have from time to time been professed by scientists. The sociologist must distinguish professed norms from the patterns of positively sanctioned behaviour; these professed norms are in themselves incapable of providing real guidance for action. Merton can point to examples of his norms in what (23) W. O. Hagstrom, The Scientific Community (New York, Basic Books, 1965), p. 10. 12</page><page sequence="11">THE SCIENTIFIC ETHOS scientists say, but does not produce any evidence of behaviour modi fied by these norms. Scientists typically stress such terms as ratio nality and scepticism in situations of celebration, justification or conflict; they are addressed to outsiders as well as to other scientists, and in the latter case, as we have shown, are too nebulous to influence behaviour. They are the terms of an ideology not readily convertible into behavioural recommendations; an ideology that has not always featured strongly in the scientific world as we shall show presently. But although professed ideals cannot, a priori, be treated as identical with statistical norms, neither can it be assumed that they have no impact on action as we have done so far. Certain professed norms linked by the Mertonians with the notion of universalism, do have implications for action within modern science. We have already expressed dissatisfaction with Merton's description of the way universalism finds expression in science via the relevance of impersonal truth criteria. The term 'universalism' finds varied definition within the Mertonian school; Merton himself (24) further sees it as implying that the "career open to talent" should be normative in science; Storer (25) defines it as referring "both to the assumption that physical laws are everywhere the same and to the principle that the truth and value of a scientific statement is independent of the characteristics of its author". Merton apparently uses universalism in the way made explicit by Talcott Parsons (26); in our view this leads to confusion within the context of the sociology of science in that it includes normative elements that have varied indepen dently of each other. A strongly articulated belief in the imperson ality of natural order and a consequent stress upon division between the observer and the observed has characterised much of science; currently (far more for instance than earlier this century) ritual rein forcement of this belief can be seen in the insistence of many scien tific journals on a presentation dominated by the passive tense and other formal features (27). The belief is usually given greater stress in science than it is in society at large and statistical norms, such as those described above or technical norms (28) concerning the treatment and interpretation of results, can result from this. But it would be nonsense to claim that scientific thought is characteristic (24) Merton, Science and Democratic Social Structure, op. cit. p. 554. (25) Storer, op. cit. p. 78. (26) T. Parsons, The Social System (New York, Free Press, 1951). (27) See for example D. Edge (ed.), Experiment (London, B.B.C., 1964). (28) Merton, Science and Democratic Social Structure, op. cit. p. 552. i3</page><page sequence="12">S. B. BARNES and R.G.A. DOLBY by virtue of its assumption of the impersonality of nature (29). Perhaps it is possible to see the role of doctor as compounded of moral norms and technical esoteric norms, and to identify the two independently: knowing how to administer a drug and when it is ethical to do so are independent. Knowledge of moral norms adds discriminant rules to a situation, specific to the role. The norms we have discussed however in two cases provide no further discriminant rules to the esoteric practices of science, and as abstractions are non specific to science. The third, scepticism, proves empirically incor rect precisely because it was formulated independently of esoteric scientific practice. Once it is seen as being patterned by this, it, too, becomes non specific. It is no accident that material demonstrating the existence of statistical norms defined by these terms is not to be found within the sociology of science. 2. Temporal Changes in Scientific Norms. In its brief history science has changed rapidly, and shows no signs of having achieved stability; its internal organisation and its relationship to external society have changed enormously since the seventeenth century. A brief review of the changes in the character of scientific activity shows that Merton, by failing to recognise the distinction between what scientists say and what they actually do, confuses aspects of science characteristic of quite different periods, putting them in a single scheme, adequate nowhere. In order to make this clear, we will contrast three main periods ; 1) The predominantly amateur science of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, persisting in England through much of the nineteenth century. 2) Professional autonomous academic science, first on a small scale in France, then on a larger scale in Germany, where it reached a peak from the mid-nineteenth century until the First World War. 3) Twentieth-century large-scale science, highly dependent on society for support, justifying itself through its applications, and carried out in a wide variety of institutional settings. i. Until the nineteenth century science was largely an activity of those with independent means, or who could obtain patronage; (29) A comparative treatment of the incidence of anthropomorphic and imper sonal cosmologies has been given by Dr. Mary Douglas, Natural Symbols (Lon don, Crosset Press, 1970). H</page><page sequence="13">THE SCIENTIFIC ETHOS scientists lacked any systematised source of support (30). Norms present within this predominantly amateur activity were in many ways quite different from those of later science. 'Science' in the modern English sense links what were separate activities at this period, activities performed by individuals who had passed through no formal socialisation processes and whose contacts with their fellows were often infrequent; the notion of an overall scientific community must be applied with caution at this period. We must ask how far a norm of communism operated in a context where men like Black and Cavendish failed to see any real need to publish their knowledge. Certainly science was a social activity and credit for discovery operated as a reward of communism at this time, but the norm does not seem to have existed as an internalised moral imperative to the extent that it did later. It was common at this period for the scientist to establish his priority, whilst keeping vital knowledge secret; this could be done by the deposition of sealed notes, or publication in code, or as an anagram. One example is the deposition by Lavoisier of a sealed note with the secretary of the French Academy in 1772. His early thoughts on the nature of combustion could thus gain priority without any advantage being yielded to the rival English (31). (Cf. the current practice of writing letters or short reports to rapid-publishing journals, making claims to topics still being worked on and yet often concealing essential details of the techniques used). A systematic basis for communism via determination of priority and allocation of recognition had not been fully developed. Disinterest was not a norm of this period. There was little scope, in general, for the practical application of science although there were prophets of its future utility (notably Francis Bacon). When the possibility of profit did occur, external values influenced what was to be done: only the more aristocratic of the amateurs could afford to ignore such things. Patronised scientists in particular were quick to pass on any practical results: better astrology with revised astronomical tables, an improved telescope, a chronometer that might work at sea. Likewise scepticism as a professed norm was little apparent (different attitudes to speculation existed within (3o) For recent discussions of this, see D. S. L. Cardwell, The Organisation of Science in England (London, Heinemann, 1957); E. Mendelsohn, The Emergence of Science as a Profession in Nineteenth Century Europe, in Karl B. Hill (ed.), The Management of Scientists (Boston, Beacon Press, 1964). (31) See for example Lavoisier's comment on his action, quoted by W. Whewfll, History of the Inductive Sciences (London 1837), vol. III, p. 131.</page><page sequence="14">S. B. BARNES and R.G.A. DOLBY different groups of scientists, but that is another matter). Professed universalism however, in the shape of strong assertions that knowledge was objective and impersonal, was fully evident and continued to be so. Amateur science moreover involved specific normative elements opposed to the standards of the 'professional' science which superseded it. The amateur was accustomed to follow his interests across the entire face of knowledge taking no account of academic boundaries nor worrying greatly about his own expertise. Faced with 'professional' emphasis on training, specialisation and demarcation of competence, assertions of the importance of total freedom of enquiry became common in amateur science; they are particularly conspicuous in the writings of English amateurs of the nineteenth century (32). If we characterise science as an institution by virtue of the existence within it of a system of recognition and reward promoting information exchange, then we can see amateur science as the institution "in embryo". The central processes promoting open information exchange were being created, to reach their greatest efficiency later in the professional stage; other normative patterns were located among sub-groups of scientists, fluctuating in importance, invariably of less importance for the cohesion of these sub-groups than their consensus with regard to a scientific paradigm. 2. It is the norms of professional academic science that especially concern Merton. With the much-copied German University system, an autonomous community of professional scientists dedicated to disinterested research became most characteristic of science. Commu nism and disinterest existed as statistical and professed norms; their importance is substantiated and partially accounted for in Ben David and Zloczower's account of the period (33). As the institu tional structure interacted with individual motivation to produce very high conformity to these norms the degree to which they were internalised is not readily determined. Doubtless they were strongly internalised in many cases, but academically trained German scientists (32) For example, some of those reacting to C. Babbage's Observations on the Decline of Science in England (1830) pointed out that English science was much freer than the French.

Buckle could argue in his History of Civilization in England (1857-1861) that the decline of French science in the late seventeenth century was largely due to the evils of the patronage of Louis XIV.

The great success of Germany's science-based indus tries can be attributed primarily to the availability and efficiency of academically trained scientists. There is no shortage of 'deviant' views among the scientists of the time ; W. H. Perkin who had moved from an academic laboratory to found the synthetic dye industry suggested in retrospect that chemists seeking new and profitable dyes had advanced chemistry rather than detracted from it; the added zeal of the extra motivation had, he claimed, been for the benefit of science (34). This statement is the negation of the norm of disin terest. Professions of disinterest, scepticism and emotional neutrality are common in the writings of this period, particularly in the polemic context of the science-religion debates, and the definition of a scientific community via training and formal qualification became tightly drawn. Thus Merton's analysis forms a viable starting point for the study of the science of this period and has led to valuable studies of the allocation of recognition and reward in academic science. One incongruity does, however, need to be pointed out. Merton bases his analysis on a conception of scientists admitting "truth claims" to a body of "certified knowledge". At this period we find less stress in the professions of scientists on the truth of their immediate work; the "working hypothesis", "provisional theory" and "guiding princi ple" increasingly form the basis of scientific practice. Although scientists never cease to stress their concern for the truth they become increasingly called upon, in their work, to deal with provisional and even speculative material presented as such. Evaluation of such material tended to be strongly dependent on differences in the para digms of scientific sub-groups. For example, the physical chemistry of solutions was given a powerful theoretical treatment in the 1880's by J. H. van't Hoff and S. Arrhenius. Although accurate only in extremely dilute solutions, the new approach provided an effective method of investigation. Within a decade physical chemists brought up with this approach attributed to it an unassailable orthodoxy, even when scientists with a different heritage were sceptical of its fundamental assumptions. The final resolution of the resulting debates was evaluated differently by each group. 3. The increase of economically attractive applications of scien tific research has allowed the continued exponental growth of science. (34) W. H. Perkin, Hofmann Memorial Lecture, Journal of the Chemical Society, LXIX (1896), 596-637. i7</page><page sequence="16">S. B. BARNES and R.G.A. DOLBY But the academic form has declined in relative importance as other institutional forms appeared. During this growth, moreover, academic science has lost some of its autonomy and increasingly the knowledge produced even by pure scientists is allowed general circulation only if national or national-military interests allow. Professions of disin terest may be expected to be less universal, even in the academic world. Changes in the technological basis of science are having their effect too. Academic "big science" is not well suited to a system of individual scientific priority rights nor do its financial demands give the same possibility of autonomy as existed in string and sealing-wax days. It is our view that the changes we have adumbrated cannot be dealt with in the ahistorical context of Merton's functionalism. This starting point produces a tendency to see changing situations as being equilibrated or at least as an analytic combination of more than one ideal equilibrium structure. This characteristic can also be discerned in Merton's work on scientific ambivalence. 3. Ambivalence and the Scientific Ethos. R. K. Merton and Elinor Barber define sociological ambivalence as incompatible normative expectations of attitudes, beliefs and behav iour assigned to a status or a set of statuses in a society (35). The most restricted sense is with the incompatible normative expectations associated with a single role. Since these norms cannot be simulta neously expressed in behaviour, they come to be expressed in an oscillation of behaviours. Such ambivalence can come from the structural context of a particular status, or from the multiple types of functions assigned to a status. How does this apply to science ? In his paper on the ambivalence of scientists, Merton tells us, "[...] one characteristic of social institutions is that they tend to be patterned in terms of potentially conflicting pairs of norms. This sets a task for those governed by the institution to blend those inconsistencies into reasonably consistent action" (36). Merton reviews several institutionally defined pairs of norms between which potential incon sistency can be found before discussing his main example of ambiva (35) R. K. Merton and E. Barber, Sociological Ambivalence, in E. A. Tirya kian (ed.), Sociological Theory, Values and Socio-Cultural Change (London, Collier Macmillan, 1963). (36) R. K. Merton, The Ambivalence of Scientists, in N. Kaplan (ed.), Science and Society (Chicago, Rand McNally, 1965), p. 112. i8</page><page sequence="17">THE SCIENTIFIC ETHOS lence towards priority in scientific discovery. We will comment on two of these pairs; our criticisms can readily be extended to the other norms listed. The objection must be made throughout that the conflict depends on the way Merton states the norms. They may reflect the difficulties and ambivalences of particular scientists, but since there is no fully established statement of most of these norms, any particular expression of them must be considered care fully. It may even be that some of them cannot be expressed in the form of a simple unqualified universal statement. Let us take the first pair of norms cited by Merton: "The scientist must be ready to make his new found knowledge available to his peers as soon as possible, but he must avoid an undue tendency to rush into print" (37). The second of these norms is too value loaded to be in any way descriptive; what does the term 'undue' signify ? The only interpretation we can suggest is that where there is a strong likelihood that a firm belief is incorrect, i.e. not knowledge at all, then to rush into print with it is undue haste. But on this interpretation the norms formulated above are not contradictory. In another paper (38), Merton seems to agree that pairs of norms producing ambivalence are not in fact contradictory but he suggests that scientists internalising both could easily be enjoined to opposed actions. One must very seriously doubt, however, whether any large number of scientists internalise such highly general aphorisms as those paired together by Merton at the beginning of this study of ambivalence. Most scientists find complex technical norms avail able with respect to publication and these doubtless, in many cases, describe an ideal path of action between the sorts of extremes implied by Merton's aphorisms. But in these cases the ideal path is the norm and tension is apparent merely because of Merton's formulations, not because of anything present in the situation. In some cases conflicting technical norms could produce psychological ambivalence (dependent of course on the personality of the individual scientist) but sociological ambivalence can only be present when social demands upon an individual are incompatible and that is not the case here. It will be worthwhile to consider Merton's second stated pair of norms to illustrate another point. "The scientist should not allow himself to be victimised by intellectual fads, those modish ideas that rise for a time and are doomed to disappear, but he must remain flexible, receptive to the promising new ideas and avoid becoming (37) Ibid. p. 113. (38) R. K. Merton, Priorities in Seien tific Discovery, American Sociological Review, XXII (1957)1 P- 635. 19</page><page sequence="18">S. B. BARNES and R.G.A DOLBY ossified under the guise of responsibly maintaining intellectual traditions" (39). It sometimes occurs within science that a sub-group of investigators develops a new idea, theory or technique. Negative evaluation of this as "an intellectual fad" (unfavourable evaluation) frequently occurs without the group who, themselves, are wont to see it as "a promising new idea" (favourable evaluation). The presence within science of the two evaluations does not necessarily lead to ambivalence as they are not always perceived and given significance simultaneously by an individual; scientists do not typi cally treat all other scientists as a significant reference group. Other norms in the list can be criticised similarly. They use persuasive forms of language where appropriately formulated des criptions would resolve conflict. They state extremes when a happy mean is required. They put norms in too general a form. They sometimes oppose the norms of separate and incompatible sub-groups. If the norms are held to be enjoined on all scientists then this is clearly incorrect. After giving these pairs as examples of conflicting norms in science, Merton goes on to consider ambivalence towards priorities in scien tific discovery. This is attributed to the role of scientist incorporating two potentially incompatible values, the value of originality leading one to want one's priority to be recognised, and the value of humility— which leads one to insist how little one has been able to accomplish. Unlike most of his list this conflict can be a genuine source of stress in science, although not because of the two norms stated. There is some doubt whether humility should be accepted as a scientific norm. The actual stress stems from science having become based upon a system analogous to that of private ownership; one that has had many difficulties and will face greater ones still in the future. The scientific system has come to be organized around a recognition of discovery as the possession of the discoverer. It is towards discoveries that homage is given, and it is discoveries for which scien tists claim property rights. This system took some time to get itself established. It required institutionalization of the process of giving credit to all prior work on which a contribution is based. It also required the recognition that the dating of discoveries should be based on the date of publication rather than when the work was done. This turned out to be necessary to avoid wrangles over unprovable claims that work had been done long before anybody else had been told. It was not until the nineteenth century that the system gained universal (39) Merton, The Ambivalence of Scientists, op. cit. p. 113. 20</page><page sequence="19">THE SCIENTIFIC ETHOS acceptance, and grew in significance as discovery rights became the primary method of evaluating a man's work with the professionalisa tion of science. Property rights for discovery seem then to have become an essential part of science. But there have always been complications. One particular source of difficulty has been the problem of simultaneous discovery. This was not at first recognised as being very common; and when it occurred, the principals often became involved in disputes about plagiarism (40). As methods of staking claims became better institutionalised, this became less and less likely and simultaneous discovery was recognised as one of the difficulties of doing science, especially in a field where many people were working. Those who were worried by it sought topics that were not being worked on by other people. This is what Faraday did in his later years, when worried by his memory failure and the attendant possibility of uncon scious plagiarism (41). But in general, scientists just repressed the difficulties that simultaneous discovery could give, and went on as before. Science has grown, and with this growth has come an increase in the rate of discovery, in the number of people working on particular topics, and in the difficulty of learning what everybody else in the field is doing. All these have increased the chance of simultaneous discovery. Less and less can the individual claim that the nature of his contribution has shaped a whole field. If he hadn't done the work, someone else would. And besides this, it has become increasingly clear that discovery is not a thing easily attributable to one man. Where tradition had seen a scientist as making a discovery that was impossible for his contemporaries, and even as being "ahead of his time" (a highly doubtful phrase) recent historical scholarship tends to show that the work done before that of the great man in question led very naturally to the discovery, and later work was frequently necessary to put it in the form that is remembered. Discovery as a property right is not as clear and natural as has been thought. For example, Kuhn (42) discusses how the discovery of oxygen was not a simple act unequivocally attributable to an individual and to a moment (4o) See for example Merton, Priorities in Scientific Discovery, op. cit. and Single tons and Multiples in Scientific Discovery, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, CV (1961), 470-486; also Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, op. cit. and Energy Conservation as an example of Simultaneous Discovery, in M.

Air enriched by the gas must have been prepared by several chemists in the early 1770's without their realising it. C. W. Scheele prepared a relatively pure sample, but did not publish his results promptly. J. Priestley prepared the gas in 1774 and identified it first as nitrous oxide, then, in 1775, as air with less than normal phlogiston. Lavoisier started his work after Priestley, characterising the gas early in 1775 as purer more respirable air, then in 1777 as a distinct species, one of the two main constituents of the atmosphere. The discovery of oxygen then was a gradual and successive process, and the contribution of an individual at any stage could as well have been made by someone else. This example appears to be typical. Traditional practice is far from having died out, but today it counts for much less than it did a century ago: new patterns are in the process of emerging which make the concept of possession of discovery even less coherent. The tendency for research to be done by whole teams, no one member of which can be called the discoverer of anything produced, has not caused the tension that might have been expected. Now a scientist can earn a reputation by being known by those who matter in the subspecialty as one who does good work, not as a discoverer. The practice of half-baked ideas being circu larised, and criticised so that when they finally appear in print they must be credited to many people, is also leading away from the tradi tional pattern. The remnants of the old practice can be seen in the difficulty of deciding whether a paper by several authors should be credited mainly to the first author listed or to all equally. Some sciences still follow the old practice, in others some people go through elaborate procedures to equalise credit (like putting names in a cycle in successive papers, so that each person has a turn at being first, or more commonly, sticking to alphabetical order, or perhaps refusing to list any names at all). So we have in the possessability of discoveries a changing institu tional form, which took some time to develop, never operated ideally (as Merton has comprehensively illustrated) (43) and is now declining in importance. Within this system manifest ambivalence, whether institutional or psychological, was and to a lesser degree still is appar ent; statistical norms are fully evident in this case. But these norms are undergoing change: Merton quotes evidence indicating that the proportion of disputes in cases of simultaneous discovery is declin (43) Merton, Priorities in Scientific Discovery, op. cit. Id. Resistance to the Systematic Study of Multiple Discoveries in Science, European Journal of Sociology, IV (1963), p. 237, 22</page><page sequence="21">THE SCIENTIFIC ETHOS ing (44) and that the extent of multiple authorship in many subjects is increasing (45). He suggests that: "For our purposes, the import of these changes is that the degree of concern with priority is probably not historically constant; second that it varies with the changing organisation of scientific work; and third that these changes may eventually and indirectly lessen the ambivalence of scientists towards obtaining recognition of the originality of their contributions" (46). We would go further than this and suggest that changes are not only occurring within the recognition system but also to the recognition system. Functionalist starting points have found difficulty in hand ling such changes and where the functionalism rests upon a normative structure entirely separate from the esoteric content of science the difficulty is exacerbated; for example, the rise of "invisible col leges" (47) can only be theoretically accounted for in the light of the logistic problems attending the dissemination of ever increasing amounts of information and the increasing division of scientific labour. Sociological studies of science can no longer afford to ignore its eso teric content nor its dynamic features. 4. Concluding remarks. Within the highly differentiated societies of today social order can be maintained by specialised agencies independently of a total normative consensus; real communication and meaningful interaction can occur between groups with widely differing practices and values. Such groups always seem to have existed in science: to put it briefly, nor mative consensus and cohesion within them have made for the efficient information exchange and cooperation invaluable in the development of science, whereas differences between them help to explain conceptual innovation and the development of new theories or disciplines. Those groups of scientists showing the greatest degree of consensus are Kuhn's paradigm-sharing communities. The cohesion, solidar ity and commitment within these stem from the technical norms of paradigms (48) not from an overall scientific 'ethos'. Technical norms can be espoused without the adoption of a "scientific identity" ; (44) Merton, The Ambivalence of Scien tists, op. cit. p. 125. (45) H. A. Zuckerman, The Nobel Lau reates in the United States. A Sociological Study of Scientific Collaboration.

J. de Solla Price, Little Science, Big Science (New York, Columbia Univer sity Press, 1963).

BARNES and R.G.A. DOLBY they are compatible with a wide range of religious, political or philo sophical orientations; they can be sanctioned in a recognition system or by financial rewards; and a variety of legitimations is available for their associated activities. Paradigm-sharing communities deal effi ciently with problems that their methods enable them to solve, but these same qualities of solidarity and cohesion limit the degree to which methods and techniques are varied in tackling the unexpected. Frequently an unexpected problem of one community is solved by members of another. Within science, with its diverse subject matter and methods of investigation, many paradigm-sharing communities exist; sometimes two or more work within a single field. Where this is the case, or where other communities are attracted to some problem formerly only relevant to one group, there are invariably differences in their success, as perceived at the time. This leads to a much greater change in the significance of the competing groups than can be accounted for by individual changes of mind. The 'successful' groups invariably obtain the lion's share of new recruits in the field, and with the continuing exponential growth of science come to form the "majority viewpoint". This is not to deny the importance of indi vidual changes of mind of course, or of such dialogues as are set up between different consensus groups, which sometimes result in a new paradigm giving overall consensus. Where two consensus groups have shared common problems relations have varied between friendly competition and bitter animos ity, both orientations, on occasions, having been 'functional'. Discussion between two such groups, although often full of initial misunderstandings, is possible using language and concepts shared outside the particular paradigms. This process of arriving at under standing is an important feature of scientific changes. In such contexts professions of scientific norms are especially common, particularly in criticism of opponents in debate. Such statements may vary from the most specific differences of method between the two groups, to general appeals for reasonableness. Appeals to rationality, scientific scepticism or disinterest tend to have little effect, and have more to do with the misunderstandings between the communities than the actual behaviour of scientists; such statements should not be abstract ed from their polemical context. Normative dissent clearly plays a vital role in science ; confrontation between technical norms implicit in paradigms is mediated and made productive by virtue of common language and culture among scientists, not by overriding specifically 'scientific' norms. Similarly the inten 24</page><page sequence="23">THE SCIENTIFIC ETHOS sity of normative conflict is cushioned by the order and rule structure of surrounding society; no scientist is totally in the power of others, sanctions are in fact very limited, particularly at certain stages of the scientific career, and few scientists are solely responsible to their specialist colleagues. We would suggest that in addition to function alist premises another element in Merton's theoretical position has contributed to an inordinate stress on overriding scientific norms: this is a tendency, in analysis, to treat every institution as a micro society with problems of integration identical to those of a total society. The nature of our disagreement with this view should by now be clear. 25</page></plain_text>
