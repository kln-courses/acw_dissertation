<plain_text><page sequence="1">German Biophysics, Objective Knowledge, and Romanticism BY CHARLES A. CULOTTA* In 1798 Friedrich Schelling said that life is the tendency toward individua tion.1 Over two generations later in 1897 Ernst Mach described death as the release from individuality.2 The similar thought and phraseology in two works a century apart are not fortuitous; they express a cultural ideal common to one of Germany's greatest romantics and to one of Germany's most renowned champions of the critical method in science. The histo riography of science has reached a stage in which it is no longer heretical to say the name of a romantic philosopher in the same breath with that of a physicist and critical philosopher.3 To suggest that affinities exist be tween early nineteenth century romantics and rigorous scientists and philosophers of science later in the century should not be considered a semantic exercise in pairing similar phraseology.4 In the main, historians of science have looked at change in science as discontinuity, revolution, watershed, and generational chasm.

Strict definition often serves only the academic purpose of dividing to conquer; the mean ings of "romanticism," "Naturphilosophie," and "Wissenschaftslehre" are not so far apart at a general level of analysis. Each reveals the German concern for epistemolog ical problems and for attitudes toward the subject matter of science. For a discussion of the problems of defining "romanticism," see John B. Halsted, ed., Romanticism. Definition, Explanation, and Evaluation (Lexington, Mass., 1965). 4Phillip Ritterbush, The Art of Organic Forms (Washington, D.C., 1968), p. 32: "Because the mechanist and vitalist positions are ultimately reducible to attitudes toward what has not yet been discovered, they are unsatisfactory as classifiers of scientific accomplishment. The label tells us not what a scientist actually discovered or stated but only where he was looking when he did it and what he made of it." 3</page><page sequence="2">4 GERMAN BIOPHYSICS, OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE, AND ROMANTICISM sensed the excitement and sometimes revolutionary mood accompanying scientific innovation. Yet they have also been troubled by their preoccu pation with precipitous change; accordingly they have searched for pre cursors of the innovative scientist or for scientific anomalies antecedent to the innovation. They have not, however, devoted sufficient attention to the influence of cultural continuities on the scientist and to the continuity of problems he faces as a practitioner of his discipline. In this study I will try to provide a cultural matrix for a scientific event that traditionally has been treated as a revolution: the rise of biophysics in opposition to the scientifically sterile romanticism of an earlier era. The preoccupation of historians with the materialist spokesmen for biophysics has obscured the influence of cultural and scientific continuity in the practice of biophysical science. Biophysics loses none of its scientific significance if we examine more fully its goals and limitations in relation to German cultural traditions of the 1830's and 1840's. The traditions that influenced biophysics include romantic views on nature and concern for unity of knowledge, national unity, the status of natural law, human freedom and consciousness, and epistemology. I will demonstrate first that German biophysicists saw and practiced their science as a limited rather than as a universal program for the physical understanding of the animate world; second, that the limited program bears a stronger resemblance to romantic than to materialist philosophies; and third, that romantic concerns, having become deeply entrenched in Germany's political ethos, were the probable origin of the psychological views of the biophysicists. By studying science within the rising German nation of the nineteenth century, the historian has a good opportunity to measure the interaction of general with scientific thought within a newly patterned social setting. The nationalistic drive of Germans for political unity, their politically planned industrial revolution,5 their educational reforms and political intervention in academic science, and their eventual dominance of the scientific world all belong to the first three quarters of the nineteenth century. Before Germans were concerned with political unity, they were con cerned with unity of thought; since the time of Leibniz, German thinkers 5See William O.

Germans felt compelled to affirm that unity and to demonstrate it whenever and wherever possible. Their concern with the unity of knowledge?with the unity of the humanities, arts, and sciences?found an institutional home in the German universities of the nineteenth century.6 The word "unity" appears so frequently in all genres of German writing that its importance cannot be doubted; the desire for unity was expressed by political reformers, by philosophical idealists, and by the rank and file of the romantic movement.7 The German romantics' introspective search 6Throughout this paper the broad cultural basis of many of the ideas discussed are indicated by a series of references in a single footnote, preventing unnecessary repeti tion of names in the test.

Subsequent influen tial philosophers also stressed the unity of all forms of knowledge; e.g., after receiving his theological degree and after his conversion to Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach studied science at Erlangen in order to grasp the whole of man, Arthur Schopenhauer struggled with unity in his The World as Will and Idea, trans.

Like the idealists, they sought a unity of man and cosmos, but not from the idealist premise of ontological universals. For them, man was to be the measure of all things. From man's individual existence and his participation in and intuitive grasp of the cosmos, unity could be achieved rather than abstractly mandated. The romantics were not lost in whimsical speculation, but were deeply concerned that their introspection related to the world about them. Although their world was sensual and anthropomorphic, it included, besides science, human freedom and moral choice.8 They sought universal order not in eighteenth century natural law, but in individual consciousness and, eventually, in the historical reality of the nation's collective consciousness.9 Romantics did not regard science as an unacceptable route to knowl edge. They did, however, reject the godless, mechanistic science of the late eighteenth century in favor of a science in which man could feel secure.10 I will examine the underlying role of romantic epistemology, regarded as a cultural influence, surviving in the work of scientists who had been exposed to romanticism in their youth. Although there are precedents for my approach,11 there is a tendency among historians to dismiss romantic notions as having had no bearing on the experimental sciences.

Historians and philosophers have tended to associate epistemology exclusively with the scientific method. This association has not only forced epistemology to bear a greater scientific burden than is historically justified, but it has also obscured the powerful influence of romantic epistemology on science. Since there is little within romanticism from which one can build a respectable scientific method, historians have slighted its influence on modern science.12 Whereas even the most conservative historians of the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution take seriously mystical and alchemical worldviews as sources of scientific attitudes toward nature, historians of modern science have failed to explore fully the relations of romanticism and the dynamics of scientific change. Too great a reliance on the generalization that Kant and Hegel were opposite philosophical poles toward which all subsequent German thinkers were attracted, or from which they were repelled, also has hampered a cultural approach to the history of nineteenth century German science. Although this generalization is certainly more true than false, the full im plication of the magnetic pole analogy must be taken into account: lines of magnetic force imply that meaningful orientations lie between the polar extremes, and hence, following the analogy, the historian should look at more than just the poles to grasp the intellectual patterns of nineteenth century Germany.13 Many of the generation of romantics and idealists succeeding Kant?such as J. G. Fichte (1762-1814), A. 12See, for example, Emile Meyerson, Identity and Reality, trans, from the 3rd French ed. in 1926 by Kate Loewenberg (London, 1930), pp. 288-289. While not exacting on scientific methodology, Schelling, for example, did make statements that profoundly affected one's outlook toward science; see Schelling, op. cit. (note 7), p. 94: "Propositions which are unconditioned, that is valid once [and] for all, are antagonistic to the nature of true science, which consists in progress." The confusion between epistemology and scientific method is pointed out in L. Laudan, "Theories of Scientific Method from Plato to Mach," Hisf. Sci., 7 (1968), 56, 79. 13J.H. Randall has shown that after 1806 German romantics followed Schelling in becoming more interested than their predecessors in empirical studies, yet he has felt it necessary to say that romanticism was harmful to science, even though science did not exist according to our modern understanding. See Randall, op. cit. (note 11), pp. 249, 250, 256; in contrast Richard Shryock, The Development of Modern Medi cine (New York, 1947), p. 200, noted that: "To understand the whole sweep of Ger man thought that was involved with particular reference to medicine and biology, one should begin by reading Schelling and end with Ernst Haeckel." It should not be forgotten that Schelling received special attention and royal favor at the Bavarian Academy; see Aloys Wenzel, "Die Vertreter der Philosophic in der bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften vom deutschen Idealismus bis zum kritischen Real</page><page sequence="6">8 GERMAN BIOPHYSICS, OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE, AND ROMANTICISM Schopenhauer (1788-1860), F. W. Schelling (1775-1854), and H. Lotze (1817-1881)?were indirect but potent influences on the formation of scientific concepts; although they used Kant's terminology and definition of causality, their philosophies were far from rigid copies of Kantian idealism.14 In addition, Kant's writings influenced several currents of thought in the nineteenth century that admitted no indebtedness, an eclectic plagiarism described by T. M. Greene.15 It was only after a group of neo-Kantians had assessed Kant's legacy as Erkenntnisstheorie that his full impact could be seen. If Kant's ideas had an ambivalent and diverse influence on the nineteenth century, so had Hegel's; the endless stream of histories dealing with the Hegelian origins of socialism, communism, the political left, orthodox German historiography, and nationalism are well known. Although historians have acknowledged that romanticism had an impact on Hegel as well as on Kant, they have little appreciated that Hegel sought to preserve a major goal of Naturphilosophie. That goal was a unified science of nature, attained through greater rigor and massive reliance upon empirical investigation.16 If the historian were forced, as he is not, to chose between the polar extremes of Kant and Hegel in locating epistemological mainstreams in Germany, Hegel would appear to him the more important of the two; however, the historian would do more justice to the rich complexity of nineteenth century German thought by recognizing that the mainstream was Kant as understood and disseminated by the Hegelians who dominated university posts in philosophy.17 An important aspect of the myriad philosophical reactions to the ismus," in Geist und Gestalt.

CULOTTA 9 Enlightenment in Germany was a reorientation toward non-Lockean theories of epistemology.18 Foreshadowed by Hume, they were cultivated by idealists, romantics, and biologists.19 The quest for a learning theory and psychology that was simultaneously anthropocentric, pragmatically mechanistic, and proximate to classical idealism provided the common ground for humanistic and scientific scholarship in the period.20 It is therefore the sympathies and concerns of the romantic movement rather than its content that guide the historian in seeking an understand ing of early biophysical science in Germany. The romantic concerns that survived in the culture of Germany in the 1830's and 1840's are man's uniqueness and freedom of moral choice, consciousness, epistemology, and the representation of the physical universe by the laws of matter and of motion. The presence of these concerns in the writings of biophysicists is evidence of their scientific relevancy or, at least, of their failure to prevent the growth of science. In either case the romantic concerns of German biophysicists place them within the cultural environment of their time. In order to lay the groundwork for evaluating the role of romantic con 18The common analogy in political thought between the growth of a plant and the growth of the state is just as indicative of an organismic outlook as vitalism in biology; and organicism goes hand in hand with descriptions of mental processes as more than the summation of sensations. See Peckham, op. cit. (note 7), p. 97: "Organicism, an Enlightenment idea in its origin, became a dominating mode of nineteenth century thinking." Eduard von Hartmann complained about Hegel's legacy of an unending stream of epistemological publications, yet admitting that "the theory of knowledge is the true philosophia prima" (Philosophy of the Unconscious; Speculative Results according to the Inductive Method of the Physical Sciences, trans, of the 9th Ger man ed. of 1884 by William Coupland [New York, 1931], p. xxxiii). 19For the general significance of epistemology, see Merz, op. cit. (note 6), 3, 197; on Hegel's epistemology, see Miller, op. cit. (note 16), p. 8; on Schelling, see op. cit. (note 7), pp. 90-91, and Walzel, op. cit. (note 7), p. 63. Schopenhauer, op. cit. (note 7), 2, 383, 387, held the same opinion as Schelling. Lotze introduced this epistemo logical position as basic to physiology in his famous article "Seele" in Rudolf Wagner's Handworterbuch der Physiologie, 4 vols. (Braunschweig, 1846), i, 143. Conscious ness-based epistemology was already integrated into the work of physiologists a gen eration earlier; see Georg Prochaska, Physiologie oder Lehre von der Natur des Menschen (Wien, 1820), p. iii. 20This is not a case study of Karl Popper's thesis on the role of epistemology and falsification in the philosophy of science. All I wish to suggest is that at this point in time in Germany epistemology was a significant component of culture, and that therefore the epistemology of Hegel, Schelling, and the Humboldts did not have to disappear to permit the rise of science. For Popper's position, see his introduction to Conjectures and Refutations; The Growth of Scientific Knowledge (New York, 1962).</page><page sequence="8">10 GERMAN BIOPHYSICS, OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE, AND ROMANTICISM cerns in biophysics, it is necessary to clear away common misconceptions about the ''revolutionary" program of the "biophysicists." They are usually pictured as the avant garde of the 1848 revolution, as if it were only natural that there be a direct link between two such contempora neous, dramatic, and secular events. The link is made by identifying the revolutionaries as crass political materialists and by regarding the bio physicists as their militant counterparts in science. The political side of the stereotype has been shown to be woefully inadequate;21 moderate political reformers were greater in number than the militants, and they experienced the greatest success, however shortlived.22 So, too, were the moderate biophysicists more successful in their careers and more numerous than their extremist scientific counterparts. Historians of science have generally regarded the biophysicists as ex tremists advocating the complete reduction of living phenomena to matter and motion,23 as champions of the revolution and total enemies of Naturphilosophie.24 The image of the biophysicists thus takes on an artificial clarity. Although biophysicists frequently made statements on behalf of their empirical science and against the speculative science of the Naturphilosophen, we may not conclude from this that the latter's philosophy was all speculation and that the biophysicists wholly rejected the previous generation's ideals.25 There is a similarity between scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes in German society, but their simi larity lies on the middle ground of thought and not on its extreme 21 The theme of moderate liberalism runs through the works of several historians; see R.

Although great tensions were created in German society by the reluctance of the classic estates to recognize the existence of, let alone relinquish political power to, the middle class,26 German science (espe cially medicine), politics, and industry were forging their common links during the biophysics period and finding an ally in the upper middle class.27 Historians of art and literature use the term "bourgeois" realism to describe the second half of the nineteenth century;28 I propose ex tending the term to include a "bourgeois55 biophysics as well.29 The worldview of the scientist warrants more detailed study than it has received in the past, and until this subject can be explored more fully, the present essay is but a prolegomenon to the task. The biophysicists best known to historians are five men all of whom worked for a time in Berlin before their careers separated them. Carl Ludwig (1816-1895), who later moved to Leipzig, Ernst Briicke (1818 1896), who later moved to Vienna, Hermann Helmholtz (1821-1895), Emil DuBois-Reymond (1818-1896), and Gustav Magnus (1802-1870) are usually referred to as the Berlin group. It is unfortunate that these men have received more attention than other biophysicists; none of the five can be classified as a typical, pioneer practitioner of biophysics or spokes man for the biophysical cause. Aside from his early years, Ludwig's role in the biophysics movement was closest to that of the typical practitioner. Helmholtz is a poor choice as an example of the typical biophysicist. His strong Kantian and Fichtean views were not shared by the others, and the physiological topics and methods he selected were not the specific organ and systemic approaches of the others who were in closer touch with the role of physiology in its typical medical school setting. Briicke was most famous for his researches in biochemistry, not biophysics, and he was a staunch opponent of the materialist theory of cell formation.30 He used physical and chemical methods, which usually set biophysicists apart from 26 Anderson, op. cit.

DuBois-Reymond was both a spokesman for and a practitioner of biophysics. His influence was more generally intellectual than scientific; in particular, he never completed his programmatic electrophysiological researches.32 Magnus was highly in fluential as a source of biophysical methods for the Berlin group. How ever, his use of these methods, acquired in Paris and in Berzelius' labora tory, was not wholly successful, and physiology was not his life's work. I have found it useful to examine a broader sample of biophysical spokesmen and practitioners than the traditional five. Equally involved in the biophysical movement were Hermann Lotze (1817-1881), Jacob Moleschott (1822-1893), Carl Vogt (1817-1895), Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795-1878), Karl Vierordt (1818-1884), and Gabriel Gustav Valentin (1810-1883). Their work first appeared in the 1830's and 1840's, before the Revolution of 1848. Although the enlarged group of eleven is not exhaustive, it is more representative than the traditional five usually dis cussed in secondary works. The members of the group differ in conceptu alization, research interest, and degree of scientific success, but their common concerns characterize the early state of biophysics. In defining the common attitudes of the biophysicists, it is essential to distinguish between the practitioners of and the spokesmen for biophysics, even in cases where both hats were worn by the same individual. The spokesmen were concerned with destroying vitalism and Naturphilosophie, the practitioners with applying physical methods to biological problems. Attacking vitalism and elucidating biophysical mechanisms may appear to have had the same purpose, but they were different activities when viewed from the standpoint of individual psychology, ability, and motiva tion. The former was destructive and polemical; the latter was construc tive and required imaginative experimental skill and rigorous standards of proof. Spokesmen were also distinguished from practitioners by their attitudes toward politics, biochemistry, and the nature of thought. I will discuss each of these attitudes in turn, beginning with the political. In general, the practitioners were blandly liberal and quiescent in political outlook, 31 Karl Rothschuh, Geschichte der Physiologie (Berlin, 1953), p. 140. 32Cranefield, op. cit. (note 23), pp. 417-418.</page><page sequence="11">CHARLES A. CULOTTA 13 occasionally having had radical leanings in their youth. The ardent spokes men were more radical and often more political. Weber33 and Ludwig34 were practitioners who had given up their youthful political activities. DuBois-Reymond on the right and Moleschott,35 Vogt,36 and Biichner on the left maintained both their political militancy and a good part of their scientific militancy throughout their lives; they are best described as the spokesmen for biophysics. For the most part their political positions were similar to those of radical reformers in other walks of life; they sought a rational basis for government outside the natural law arguments for authority of the conservative politicians.37 The spokesmen's outlook toward science had similar antiauthoritarian and anti-natural law over tones. To the spokesmen, a science of descriptive laws such as those of polarity or vital force was nothing more than speculation from principles. They sought instead to explain all animate phenomena by the rules and facts known about matter and motion, relying on experimentation, not on authority. It is this antiauthoritarian position that has led historians to associate the extremist spokesmen with the spirit of 1848. However, there were other justifications for doing biophysics, ones typical of the practi tioners rather than of the politically motivated spokesmen. The political ideas of the biophysical spokesmen were not those that were a major force in German society at midcentury; neither were their scientific ideologies and achievements a major force in biophysical research. Moleschott was popular with university science students, perhaps more because of his politics than his biology. He believed that under the political conditions of Germany, the fruits of scientific labor were being consumed by priests, nobles, and businessmen?by the nonproductive elements in society.38 For him knowledge was the key to power, and since knowledge was gained by scientific means the political prescription 33P.

Traditional authority survived the revolution, as it survived unification in 1870;41 scientists were poorly represented in the Frankfurt Parliament of 184? and in the Reichstag membership throughout the century.42 Nor does Moleschott's vision correspond to the subsequent self-image of the pro fessorial Geheimrath;43 German scientists did not seek political power but complacently subsisted on government support after 1848.44 Vogt alone of the biophysicists sought and won a seat in the Frankfurt Parliament; he did so as Berlin's representative from the radical party. Berlin was one of the more radical German cities because of a higher percentage of enfranchised lower classes, not because the professors at Prussia's largest university were radical.45 The biophysical extremists such as Vogt regarded their interest in materialism as allied to the larger, more 39Ibid., p. 500. 40Eyck, op. cit.

Moleschott did not profit from government support of science, spending his mature years on the periphery of German science in virtual exile, first in Switzerland and later in Italy; he preached to a nonexistent political movement. Biichner was.to quit university teaching and to enter private practice. Ludwig lost his Marburg post and worked for a time in Vienna before returning to Leipzig shorn of his youthful radicalism. Vogt was able to continue teaching only by leaving Germany for Switzerland. It seems to be a rule that the greater the political ex tremism of the biophysicists the greater their distance from Berlin. The spokesmen Moleschott and Vogt, devoid of the hierarchical evalua tion of man of Enlightenment natural law systems, appeared willing to accept the view that strict determinism meant the loss of human free dom.49 Yet in Vogt's speeches before parliament, he advocated the right of man to be free as though he were still in the natural law tradition.50 Later in his treatise on anthropology, Vogt argued that man was not a beast-machine; rather, man was the high point and end product of evolution.51 The anti-Enlightenment approaches to the problem of human freedom can also be seen in an apparent exception to my case of anti natural law political extremists: Rudolf Virchow.

He vigorously fought to bring about medical reforms in 1848, while at the same time holding to natural law conceptions of nature and society.52 He was a typical nineteenth century German in his pre occupation with cultural nationalism and in his hope for political unifica tion on this basis. He was typical, too, in deriving from his understanding of human consciousness the cultural uniqueness of the German people as the basis for unifying political action. He believed that consciousness was a cumulative memory passed from generation to generation, surfacing as the culture of a nation.53 For him natural law was not an obstacle to the political goals that he and his countrymen held for Germany. Political action was a response to an innate natural force; and natural authority was not violated in reform or revolution leading to national unity, since that authority belonged to the collective memory. Consequently, the freedom of the individual in harmony with his authoritarian cultural destiny was also preserved. The biophysical spokesmen such as Moleschott and Vogt?and Virchow, too?shared certain distinguishing characteristics: First, they were com mitted to antigovernment or antitheological subplots, a commitment un common among the biophysicists.54 The extremist position was similar to the earlier political idealism and scientific mechanism of Johann Gottlieb Fichte.55 The second distinguishing characteristic of the spokesmen, setting them apart from the practitioner, was their preoccupation with what today might be called biochemistry.56 Their sensitivity to bio chemical arguments may be attributed in part to the wide influence of Justus von Liebig and Johannes M?ller, both of whom placed physiological chemistry on the side of vitalism. The spokesmen Moleschott, B?chner, and Vogt were forced by their antivitalist goals to discuss the subject of nutrition and to investigate it by the techniques of organic chemistry; 52R.

CULOTTA 17 since the formation of flesh from bread was one of the major arguments for vitalism in Germany, nutritional research entered into their polemics.57 The practicing biophysicists tended to shy away from chemical arguments, not because of any theoretical objections; they usually did not need such arguments, since their researches and methods depended on electrical and pressure-related physical apparatus. Although the practicing biophysicists would accept chemical arguments when they were to their advantage, they turned to physical chemistry, not to organic chemistry. The third dis tinguishing characteristic of the spokesmen was their concern with the source of human thought. They desired to give thought a wholly physical explanation. Moleschott equated thinking with the decomposition of phosphates and Vogt, following Cabanis, suggested that thought may be secreted by the brain just as bile is secreted by the liver; few people took either of these positions seriously. By contrast with the spokesmen, the practitioners did not try to explain thought; they preferred instead to analyze the process of sensation. Keeping these distinctions in mind, I want now to discuss the work of the practitioners of biophysics. The historical view that biophysicists ad vocated the complete reduction of all phenomena to matter and motion needs correcting; rather they claimed that biophysics was able to explain all biological phenomena that were capable of definition by matter and motion. The biophysics movement was less original and countercultural than has generally been assumed. This reinterpretation is supported by three characteristics of the practitioners. First, in their actual scientific work the practitioners were seldom dogmatic. Second, their stated goals did not include that of unlimited or complete knowledge of life; this sense of limit occurs on practical, epistemological, and methodological levels. Third, DuBois-Reymond, who is usually cited as the programmatic spokes man for a biophysics that would encompass all of biology, assumed that role only in defensive, not in offensive, argument. The major thrust of biophysics followed two lines of research: first, elec trical experiments on muscle and nerve tissue, and second, pressure related problems such as diffusion, osmosis, absorption, and liquid flow proper ties. The connection between electricity and life is the older of these two themes and has important links to attitudes of the romantics and Natur philosophen at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The pressure and 57Misteli, op. cit. (note 40), pp. 37-38; Biichner, op. cit. (note 48), pp. xlii, 135 136; Moleschott, op. cit.

Graham; Graham's work, appearing in the 1830's, was especially impor tant for German scientists. Biophysics implies the existence of an appli cable physics, and electricity and fluid dynamics provided biological scien tists what rational mechanics could not; namely, a direct way to compare, measure, or produce dynamical models of contraction, blood flow, secre tion, assimilation, cell formation by crystallization, and energy transfer. The use of such physical techniques and concepts did not require any dras tic revision of prior experimental trends in the biomedical disciplines. Al brecht von Haller had focused attention on muscle and nerve tissue in the eighteenth century with his concepts of irritability and sensibility; and eighteenth and early nineteenth century medical systems commonly relied upon the circulatory system to explain inflammation, irritation, and gen eral pathology. Thus the new physical principles and apparatus in the mid dle of the nineteenth century were easily adapted to questions that had long been of concern to biomedical scientists. In their application of physical principles to biology, the biophysicists were seldom able to reconstruct what might be called a totally physical liv ing system, let alone define all life functions physically. In 1837, for ex ample, Magnus claimed that oxygen and carbon dioxide were absorbed and released from the blood stream according to Dalton's laws of gaseous ab sorption;58 in other words, oxygen, the fundamental element in the steam engine analogy of the body, was transferred by wholly physical means. By 1845, however, Magnus had admitted the inadequacy of a wholly physical interpretation of blood gas exchange; chemical analyses had shown in the meantime that blood contains far more oxygen and carbon dioxide than could be explained by the absorption laws.59 Nonetheless, he regarded himself as no less a biophysicist in 1845 than in 1837; his methodology was adequate for all of biological reality. In the 1840's Valentin and Vierordt attempted to explain pulmonary gas exchange on the basis of Graham's law of diffusion, which predicted that if oxygen and carbon dioxide were placed on either side of a membrane, less carbon dioxide would cross over the membrane than would oxygen; the law had a precise mathematical formulation based on molecular 58G.

Since animals give up a smaller volume of carbon dioxide than the volume of oxygen they breathe (respiratory quotient less than one), Valen tin and Vierordt thought they had found an important, precise physical mechanism.60 In 1852 Valentin admitted that the similarity between the results of diffusion law experiments and the respiratory quotient was merely mathematical, not physiological.61 Vierordt, too, admitted that his own efforts had not confirmed the strict operation of physical laws in liv ing systems, and although he believed that confirmation would come one day,62 he coined the term "parenchymatic diffusion" to characterize the diffusion process in living animals and to distinguish it from the simpler form of diffusion known to physicists.63 Retaining a strong faith in the fu ture of his physical methodology, Vierordt recognized that there are no simple, direct analogies between the organic and the inorganic. Valentin, Vierordt, and Ludwig were militant defenders of biophysics, yet their defense did not rely upon any expectation of attaining ultimate knowledge of life through physics or through a materialist philosophy. They believed that physical laws were the best approximations to knowl edge of physiological processes that themselves could never be exactly known.64 Ludwig was even responsible for discrediting the early mechanis tic pronouncements of Valentin and Vierordt, carefully pointing out the differences between Graham's stucco plugs and the multilayered living tis sue of the lung whose properties were not understood.

Physical principles alone could not save the phenomena;67 if biophysics were to be the new biology, the "bio" was as important as the "physics." Other major biophysicists showed similar caution in their expectations for a physical understanding of life. Helmholtz, a master of both the physi cal and the biological sciences, expected no more of a derivative science such as biology than he expected of pure physics. For example, he stated that one can never know the Kantian thing-in-itself;68 knowledge was lim ited by the fact that the senses could not grasp reality in a "real way." Sensate knowledge was only a symbol, an inexact copy, of the reality out side man; the symbol in fact need not even be similar to that outer reality. All that causality in scientific explanation required was that man perceive the same symbol in response to the same set of conditions; whatever laws man placed upon the world outside himself were symbolic of reality, not an absolute, ideal, transcendental, or universal abstraction drawn in Aristo telian or Platonic fashion from that outer reality.

There was no emphasis upon mathe matizing biological knowledge, as one would expect in an ideal Kantian science; indeed, antimathematical sentiments were expressed by Mole schott, DuBois-Reymond, and Ludwig as well as by the larger group of German humanists.72 Instead of a bold Kantian demand to mentally im pose causality and unity on nature from necessary empirical relationships, one finds constant doubt and caution among many biophysicists, some *9lbid? pp. 175, 179, 201. 70On humanists, see Iggers, op. cit.

Idealism was in disrepute after the 1820's, and the biophysicist practitioners favored an empiricism that stressed experiment in place of mere observation. German biophysical empiricism had, in addition to its native roots in ro manticism and idealism, foreign roots as well. French science was emulated by at least some of the trained scientists in Germany; lines of intellectual communication between France and Germany have been noted often by historians.73 It is well known that Carl Rudolphi brought back to Ger many an empirical bent through his Parisian training and that he passed it on to Johannes M?ller.74 Such linkage of German to French educational circles dated from the Humboldt and Stein era of reform,75 and it ex tended to the German medical school curricula in the first quarter of the nineteenth century.76 Laplace's astronomy represented the high point of French scientific rigor for many German biophysicists such as Br?cke, DuBois-Reymond, Moleschott, Ludwig, and Vogt and for influential philosophers such as Lotze and Schopenhauer who acted, in part, as spokesmen for the biophysical cause.77 Laplace's appeal lay in his claim that the entire future and past of the world was within the grasp of a 73Shryock, op. cit.

Inherent in this claim lay the method by which all natural phenomena could be reduced to matter and motion.78 Yet Laplace's claim also pointed to the limits of scientific ex planation that German biophysicists felt so strongly; there was no super brain nor even means of knowing the initial conditions of a fraction of the cosmos. The areas of physiology that most interested biophysicists?sensation, comparative anatomy and physiology, electrical phenomena (muscle and nerve tissue), and pressure phenomena (diffusion, osmosis, hemodynamics) ?also had French as well as native roots. Magnus went to France to study physical chemistry, and Vogt improved his techniques under the super vision of French chemists. Weber, who was the pioneer of biophysics in the eyes of Ludwig and Helmholtz, took an interest in pressure related phenomena through the French physiologist Jean Poiseuille; Ludwig worked on circulatory problems as a student under Weber. Liebig, who be came the vitalist enemy of his students Vogt and Moleschott, also worked in Parisian chemical laboratories. Electrical phenomena and sensory theory have well known roots in the work of German romantic scientists. Cuvier, a German transplant in France, raised comparative anatomy to a high level of precision, one that was admired for its ability to reveal unity in the animate world. Comparative anatomy was immensely popular in Germany where it served to draw together waning speculative tendencies and the new demands for empiricism. Goethe and Schelling, in addition to Hegel, played an important role in bringing about a transition from Kantian and Fichtean idealism to an empirical approach in biology. In addition to establishing the general in fluence of Naturphilosophie on physiologists,79 K. Rothschuh has traced Lotze, op. cit. (note 19), 1, xiv. In his "Ueber Neo-Vitalismus," DuBois-Reymond writes as if there were no physiologists between the Frenchman Magendie and the German J. M?ller (Reden [note 72], 2, 495). 78Moleschott, op. cit. (note 38), p. vi, never claimed that he knew how to account for or to circumvent consciousness; yet, he asserted that if he could not account for all higher animate functions with a materialist model of the brain, there could be no physiology. 79Rothschuh, op. cit.

To understand the German biophysicists' sense of limits of knowledge, it is useful to examine their treatment of consciousness, a phenomenon which they saw as the final, ultimate problem of biology. No biophysicist defined consciousness by physical or chemical means. The popularizing spokesmen?Vogt, B?chner, and Moleschott?came closest to doing so, but fell short;82 thought for them might well be physico-chemical, but the interpretation of consciousness (Bewusstein) as awareness of thought or free will remained for them unresolved.83 The biophysicists in fact tended to avoid treating the problem of con sciousness; given the political ethos in Germany, it would be strange in deed for a German scientist to propose to explain it away. The most influential early statement of biophysics?Lotze's article on "Lebenskraft" in 1842 in R. Wagner's Handw?rterbuch der Physiologie?claimed that a causal chain might be rigorously determined, but that the last element in the chain could be the divine creator.84 Since the final link in the chain lay outside the jurisdiction of science, its mention might seem superfluous. But it was not superfluous for Lotze, who believed that man had free will. 80Rothschuh, op. cit. (note 7), pp. 398-400; and "Urspriinge und Wandlungen der physiologischen Denkweisen im 19.

CULOTTA 25 In stripping nature of its final causes, vital principles, essences, and souls, the scientist must still endow the human organism with the freedom that man perceives in himself. For Lotze, who was influenced by Schelling's Naturphilosophie, preserving freedom of the will was as important as removing purpose from biological models.85 Lotze regarded consciousness as something more than the summation of sensations.86 For biophysicists, to cease defining the soul was not the same as eliminating the soul's "known" functions; they accepted the soul as part of man, even if they called it the mind or consciousness and did not recognize it as part of physiology. Cranefield has suggested that DuBois-Reymond set consciousness apart from biophysics only after trying and failing to incorporate it.87 But from the beginning DuBois-Reymond readily admitted the limitations of bio physics; he did not say that all phenomena, including consciousness, are subject to definition by matter and motion, but only that all phenomena 85Lotze, "Lebenskraft," in Wagner, op. cit.

With biophysics unable to provide an an swer to the ultimate problem of consciousness, DuBois-Reymond?here acting as spokesman more than as practitioner?anticipated that physics, the science from which biophysics was derived, might eventually yield an answer. In his "Seven Riddles of the World," written in 1882, he spoke of the possibility that when the next subdivision of matter was achieved thought and the freedom of the will would be explained: "If matter thus exhibits different modes of action according to the degrees of its division, why may it not even think when under still a finer division?"89 Only if this came about would the epistemological problem be resolved; for only then would consciousness be translated from the mind into measurable, empirical reality, only then would determinism become an acceptable philosophy. German romantics, philosophers, and biophysicists held similar views on consciousness. The romantics and their successors came under the influ ence of French ideas, but they Germanized them so that the ideas had little contact any more with French epistemology or psychology. French ideas, however important to German science, did not alter the strong pi etist, nationalist, and essentially romantic-idealist tradition in Germany. That tradition underlay the separation of consciousness from the subject matter of science. Schelling believed consciousness was the prerequisite for observation, not an observable itself; consciousness was action, not sub stance. He said that "I would be nothing if I were not I."90 The ego {das Ich) existed only in so far as it was conscious of itself, a nineteenth cen tury version of Descartes' cogito ergo sum. Consciousness was a hallowed cultural concept; it was a source of self-definition, awareness, freedom, and, for idealists like Kant, of law, causality, and unity in the physical world. Biophysicists, having accepted their cultural heritage, mirrored ro mantic ideology while disavowing its method, i.e., its formal metaphysics. The later romantics greatly abetted the movement away from formal meta physics by their insistence upon empirical study and methods.

CULOTTA 27 fered only slightly in their positions on consciousness, even though they differed greatly in their scientific methods. T. Ribot, who, like James, pio neered the study of consciousness, complained of the lack of published material on his topic: he attributed the lack to the self-imposed limits of German biophysicists and psychologists.91 Biophysicists could have pro vided some kind of explanation of consciousness, but they did not choose to, and for good reasons. They, like romantics, drew a line beyond which they seldom if ever ventured, and consciousness was beyond that line.92 If biophysics was not absolutist, it was also not relativist, not at least if one respects Helmholtz' theoretical symbol as standing for correspondence with reality. The biophysicists believed that the fit between theory and data was possible, but that the fit lay in the realm of probable cause, not in that of strict, absolute causality. Ludwig, the most typical of the practi tioners, stated that completely deterministic answers to biological ques tions were possible only when the positions and forces of atoms compris ing an organism were known in their original condition of coming together.93 He certainly never claimed to possess the Lap lacean super brain; the "never will be known" phrase of Ludwig and other biophysicists was not merely the result of their awareness of an incomplete state of knowledge that could be completely overcome at some future date, but of their awareness of what to expect from the pursuit of knowledge. Helm holtz' recognition that there can be no proof or disproof of a vitalist argu ment was but another reflection of that same awareness. Viewing their science as a causally probable enterprise, biophysicists were, as we should expect, especially concerned with certain problems. One was the role of analogy; that role had to be constantly probed when one science, physics, was applied to another, biology. Another was the problem of sensation; since sensate knowledge was only a symbol of na ture, studies of sensation took on a heightened significance, just as they had in the romantic era (see Appendix). A third was the problem of meth odology; the preoccupation with sensation and analogy in biophysics was 91T. Ribot, German Psychology of Today, trans, from 2nd rev. ed. by J.

The fallacy lies merely in the application of this view to cases in which the premises for it are lacking or are not sufficient."95 Mach added that "physics therefore still has much that is new to learn from a study of the organic before it is in a position to control the organic."96 Biophysics, even according to physicists like Mach, was not synonymous with physics.97 In raising his voice in the interest of the unity of knowledge, Mach was not responding to a sense of failure either on his own part or on that of his predecessors in biophysics; rather, like DuBois-Reymond, he thought that physics in its present state was inadequate to the task of developing a completely physi cal biology. Mach and DuBois-Reymond hoped that the incompleteness of biophys ics was only temporary, owing to the inadequacy of contemporary phys ics; the practitioner of biophysics, however, was apt to see the incomplete ness through the eyes of biological experience. Helmholtz showed the same openminded and cautious questioning as Mach, but with the attitude of the biologist, even of the biophysicist, rather than the physicist: "The animal body . . . does not differ from the steam engine as regards the man ner in which it obtains heat and force, but does differ from it in the man ner in which the force gained is to be made use of."98 Helmholtz was aware of the pitfalls of analogy; like Lotze, he knew that only by the care ful choice of a methodology could one obtain good results from analogy.99 Kant, Schelling, Hegel, and Schopenhauer had voiced similar concerns with method.100 Ludwig's famous dictum, "die Methode ist alies," was not the 94Johannes M?ller's inaugural lecture at Bonn University on 19 October 1824, "On the Requirements of Physiology according to a Philosophical Understanding of Nature"; see Wolfgang Jacob, Medizinische Anthropologie im 19.

Biology and physiology were to be understood with the aid of physics, not reduced in all particulars to physical laws. The biophysicist practitioners were not so much intent upon a materialist philosophy or biology as on a mechanistic, physical biology that would build a unity of the sciences. If they left biology intact with physically irreducible, biologi cal elements, there were cultural as well as methodological and scientific reasons for doing so. Reviewing the development of medicine in his life time, Helmholtz observed that: "Our generation has had to suffer under the tyranny of spiritualistic metaphysics; the newer generation will prob ably have to guard against that of the materialistic hypothesis."101 For the biophysicists, the unity of knowledge was the real issue and ra tionale for the reductionist program. Mach said that "I only seek to adopt in physics a point of view that need not be changed the moment our glance is carried over into the domain of another science; for ultimately, all must form one whole."102 He believed that physics would change through its relation to physiology: "The result of this investigation will not be a dualism, but rather a science which, embracing both the organic and the inorganic, shall interpret the facts that are common to the two departments."103 Mach did not imply a complete understanding in either physics or physiology. For if they wish to comprehend all in one, they can admit only an absolute thesis, but they must forgo science. Thus it is indeed clear that in true science each proposition has only a definite and, so to speak, local significance, and that, taken away from its definite locus and posited as an absolute (dogmatic) one, the proposition either loses sense and mean ing or entangles us in contradictions. In so far then as method means the way of progression, it is evident that here method is inseparable from the essence, and aside from the method even the subject matter is lost. Whoever then believes that he may take the last [essence] for the first [method], and vice versa, or that he can recoin the proposition which should be valid only in a definite locus, into a uni versal or unlimited one, may indeed stir up sufficient confusion and contradictions for the ignorant in this way, but he has really not touched the matter itself, much less harmed it. Schopenhauer stated his view on method more succinctly, op. cit. (note 7), 3, 310: "Rule and application, method and achievement, must, like matter and form, be inseparable." 101Helmholtz, On Thought in Medicine (1877), trans. E.

The biophysicists were not as successful in their program for biology as they had hoped, but they did not completely fail. They worked towards a biology that would be as rigorous as the phys ical sciences which, as Lotze, Helmholtz, and DuBois-Reymond had shown, possessed limits of their own.105 In their search for a unified Wissen schaft, they sought to banish from science the spiritual metaphysics of their predecessors and to eliminate teleological arguments from biology.106 Their failure was certainly no greater than that of German biochemists, Darwinists, or socialists, just as their preoccupation with unity, limits of knowledge, sensation, individual freedom, matter and motion, methodo logical emphasis, and use of analogy were the concerns of the culture that shaped the politics, history, and science of Germany. The methods of bio physics emerging in this era cannot have avoided being touched by these concerns. Although the Berlin group of biophysicists has received the greatest historical attention, the Leipzig group?Weber, Ludwig, and Vierordt?is more typical of the successful practitioners than the Berlin group. In evaluating the success or failure of biophysics, it must be kept in mind that not all of biology came under its influence. The biophysicists were a small minority of physiologists, whereas the majority of biological scien tists were trained in traditional chemical techniques.107 Organic chemistry in Germany reached its zenith during the lifetimes of the biophysicists and did not relinquish its leadership in chemistry until World War I. Cranefield has provided a convincing analysis of the social reasons for a lack of "take off" in biophysics.108 Training and research in physiology were largely a medical school phenomenon, and few medical students had the necessary training in the physical sciences to work in an increasingly difficult field like biophysics.

Evolution, the cell, bacteriology, and clini cal work provided biological scientists with opportunity for achievement with far less preparation than that required for achievement within biophysics. The application of physics to biology could not alter the fact that con sciousness was inexplicable for cultural as well as methodological rea sons.109 Even on the basis of the use of analogy for achieving unity of knowledge, consciousness remained untouched by physics and biology. The early nineteenth century's explicit concern for consciousness was not continued by practicing biophysicists in their attempt to establish physiol ogy as a rigorous science. Consciousness, however, lost none of its deep sig nificance for the practitioners by their pretension that it did not apply to their science. The spokesmen for biophysics pointed to the overall cultural importance of consciousness by arguing for its inclusion in the biophysical outlook. If there is any marked failure of the biophysics movement, it must be attributed to the spokesmen and their extremist goals, not to the biophysical practitioners. The spokesmen could not escape the unwanted Cartesian dualism. If the unity of the sciences, the unity of all knowledge, were imposed upon nature by the mind, as the biophysicists believed, then consciousness could not be eliminated from the scientists' concern, although it could be ignored in laboratory practice and in the language of science. The domi nant issues of consciousness and unity of knowledge lead us once again to Kant and Hegel, whose philosophies supposedly ruled the century in Ger many. The separation of consciousness from physiology, the use of con sciousness as a mirror of knowledge, and the critical concern for method point to the fact that, deliberately or not, the biophysicists came down heavily on the side of Hegel;110 method, process, and the significance of the observer in romantic biology slowly evolved into the dialectic of biophysics. Given the cultural roots laid down by German romantics and idealists, any change in the sense of self, or the unity of knowledge, or the unity of the sciences, or consciousness-based epistemology would lead to changes in 109George Mead, Movements of Thought in the Nineteenth Century (Chicago, 1936), pp. 85, 109; Haym, op. cit.

By the turn of the century, consciousness, in its full context of meaning, had resurfaced in the frequently discussed topics of the new sciences, psychiatry and soci ology. Under the pressure of industrialization, the individual felt a height ened sense of alienation; his freedom, uniqueness, and unity with the outer world, which consciousness had conveyed previously to man, were threatened. In an age of crisis, consciousness was a subject for the social and psychological pathologist.111 In this context the scientism of the turn of the century should not be thought of as the end of the unity of knowl edge and value, but as the last of a long series of attempts to assure that unity. In psychiatry Freud dissected consciousness, and in naming its com ponents the id, ego, and superego he sought to preserve consciousness by giving it once more a secure ontological status; its century-long epistemo logical foothold in German culture was no longer assured. It was far more common, however, to transfer allegiance from the values of the individual to the values of society. Value, unity, dynamical change, limits, freedom, and free will were transferred to the group by the sociologist, the nation by the statesman, and the whole organism by the biologist. Organicism once again became widespread and acceptable among biologists. Although organicism had never entirely disappeared from biology, it became a fash ionable subject at the turn of the century.112 By recognizing that the biophysicists were not the dogmatic reduction ists they have been said to be, we see that they fit much better into their intellectual period. The transition from romantic to biophysicist, e.g., from Johannes M?ller to his pupils, becomes less episodic and more under standable. Further, by this recognition we see that late nineteenth century organicism was not such a drastic change. As Alfred North Whitehead pointed out in Process and Reality, the separation of consciousness from sensation is fundamentally an organismic approach to animate phenom ena.113 With the advantage of hindsight, one can see that the midcentury biophysicists were mildly organismic because of their German cultural background, and their successors, therefore, had not so far to go to acquire their stronger, more explicit organismic outlook.

Temkin has pointed out.114 The spokesmen for biophysics succeeded in conveying the impression that science was radical, antitheological, and materialistic to certain peo ple. So too the practitioners succeeded in establishing a securer place for the physical sciences in biology. Since few biologists, whatever their philo sophical stance, ever completely denied the physical sciences a place in their own science, the accomplishment of the practitioners was not their program but their specific, exact, and successful explanation of certain limited biological phenomena with the aid of physical principles and meth ods. Insofar as the practitioners were also spokesmen, they shared the spokesmen's failure to reduce biology to physics and chemistry. Nineteenth century science is beginning to come into historical perspec tive. I would like to see historians explore the cultural values of scientists, their motivations, and their expectations as well as the scientific problems internal to specific disciplines. In this paper I have studied only one area of biological research. I have made no attempt to distinguish those philoso phers and scientists who saw consciousness as prior to sensation from those who saw it as the result of sensation; the significance of the wide spread belief in innate ideas for conceptions of scientific method is still to be determined. I have not dealt with the other biological disciplines*, i.e., embryology, biochemistry, bacteriology, histology, and general zoology. Nor have I dealt with the second generation of biophysicists; knowing to what extent their immediate cultural, intellectual, and social contexts re semble or differ from patterns I have discussed in this paper could greatly aid in understanding the motivations and expectations of scientists and hence the overall course of science.115 114Temkin, op. cit, (note 36), pp. 322-327. 115 For an example of a similar pattern of cultural relationships of a scientific discipline, see Pierce C. Mullen, The Preconditions and Reception of Darwinian Biology in Germany, 1800-1870, unpublished Universify of California dissertation (Berkeley, 1964).</page><page sequence="32">APPENDIX The purpose of this appendix is to further support my distinction be tween the practitioners and spokesmen of biophysics. I have used an inde pendent source of statistics on the discoveries of the biophysicists I have discussed in this paper, Karl Rothschuh's Entwicklungsgeschichte physio logischer Probleme in Tabellenform (M?nchen, 1952) breaks down the subject matter of physiology according to anatomical parts and systems and lists major discoveries together with source and author references. I have constructed Table I from Rothschuh's index of the total number of discoveries listed for individual biophysicists. It should be noted that pe ripheral nerves and sensory organs were the subject of considerable bio physical research, but that the brain and spinal cord, representing the higher nervous and mental functions, were not. If biophysicists had con ceived of thought as wholly materialist, they ought to have shown interest in the brain and spinal cord. That they preferred to study the organs of sensation reflects their attitudes on method, epistemology, and consciousness. I have used data from Table I to construct Table II, which gives areas of research reflecting broad methodological approaches rather than Roth schuh's anatomical areas. Table II agrees by and large with the biophysical approaches and interests as defined in this paper. The third column in Table II is a relative measure of the significance of biophysical discovery for biological research as a whole. The fourth col umn is a relative measure of the significance of any one specialty or method within the biophysical discoveries of the group as a whole. A com parison of the two columns indicates that subjects most frequently ap pearing in historical discussions of biophysics, namely, animal heat and metabolism, were not the major concerns of nineteenth century biophysi cists. Undoubtedly the historical imbalance is the result of paying greater attention to the spokesmen of biophysics than to its practitioners. The dominant concerns of the practitioners were phenomena measurable by pressure related methodologies, sensory organs and sensation, and electri cal and electrically testable phenomena. Table III is a graphic representation of the schema in Table II, but here broken down into the contributions of each biophysicist according to the method or specialty. Table III clearly indicates that the biophysical work of the militant spokesmen was limited in scope by comparison with that of the other bio 34</page><page sequence="33">TABLE I Discoveries Made by the Biophysics Group According to Rothschuh's Categories Helmholtz Ludwig Vogt Weber DuBois-Reymond Br?cke Valentin Vierordt Moleschott Blood Respiration Heart Circulation and Circulatory Regulation Energy and Heat Metabolism Secretion Kidney Muscle Peripheral Nerves Spinal Nerves Brain Physiological Optics Hearing Other Senses Total No. of Discoveries 6 2 2 1 15 9 40 26 5 13 1 19 1 9 19 15 3 1 12</page><page sequence="34">36 GERMAN BIOPHYSICS, OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE, AND ROMANTICISM TABLE II Relative Significance of Research within the Biophysical Group Areas of Discovery Grouped by Method or Specialty Number of Discoveries Percentage Representation of All Discoveries in Rothschuh's Categories Percentage of Total Discoveries in Bio physical Group Metabolism 16 Energy and Heat 8 Pressure 52 Secretion Respiration Circulation Heart Kidney Electricity 27 Muscle Peripheral Nerve Spinal Nerve Brain Sensation and Sensory Organs 43 Physiological Optics Hearing Other Blood 2 11 8 17 13 3 16 8 2 19 11 13 8.0 8.8 7.0 6.0 11.7 1.5 10.8 5.4 35.1 18.2 29.1 1.4 physicists. The frequency with which any one method or specialty is repre sented in Table III is, of course, not a clear indication of the ingenuity or success with which the method was applied or the specialty pursued; it is only a measure of the degree of diversity of research of each biophysicist. Table IV provides two additional ranking systems which can be used for comparative analyses. By correlating the data in the ranking scales in Tables III and IV certain facts become clear. The militant spokesmen were attracted to metabolism problems, and the practitioners were not. On all three scales, Biichner and Moleschott were less typical, less successful, and less diverse in their inter</page><page sequence="35">Table III Rank of Biophysicists by Methodology and Specialty (Each bar represents 100% of research according to Rothschuh) Brucke Vierordt Helmholtz Weber Du Bois-Reymond Blood Sensory Pressure Electrical Metabolism Energy</page><page sequence="36">38 GERMAN BIOPHYSICS, OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE, AND ROMANTICISM TABLE IV Rank of Individual Biophysicists by Success in Discovery Rank by Number of Discoveries (from Table I) Rank by Number of Specialties Represented by Individual Discoveries (from Table I) Helmholtz 40 Ludwig 26 Vogt 19 Weber 19 DuBois-Reymond 15 Br?cke 12 Valentin 8 Vierordt 7 Moleschott 1 B?chner 1 Helmholtz 8 Br?cke 7 Weber 7 Ludwig 6 Vierordt 5 Valentin 4 DuBois-Reymond 4 Vogt 3 Moleschott 1 B?chner 1 ests than the others. The second column of Table IV merits special atten tion. It measures the degree of success that each man had in applying bio physics to a variety of animal functions; in it, Vogt is ranked with the other militant materialists. As a scientist Vogt was more diverse and ca pable than Moleschott or B?chner, yet his discoveries were restricted to specific areas of biology, as were DuBois-Reymond's. Column two of Ta ble IV correlates rather well with my qualitative discussion: the militancy of a biophysicist is inversely proportional to his success in applying physics to biology. A breakoff point of less than four to five specialty areas of no table discovery separates spokesmen from practitioners. The breakoff point is marked by those men such as Ludwig and Vierordt who were willing to modify their youthful exuberance and mold physics to biological parameters. The second column of Table IV places interme diate level spokesmen in the middle range of achievement and nonpro grammatic biophysicists in the highest range of achievement. Weber, Helm holtz, and Br?cke reveal a rich talent for biological and biophysical methodology; Ludwig achieved nearly as much by ingenious application of a more limited range of methodologies. In sum, the spokesmen and the successful practitioners can be distinguished by performance as well as by style and objective.</page></plain_text>
