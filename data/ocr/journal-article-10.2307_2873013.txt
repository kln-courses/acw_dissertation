<plain_text><page sequence="1">"AGAINST HIS BETTER KNOWLEDGE": A CASE FOR ADAM BY JOHN REICHERT When Eve, "1with liberal hand," offers the forbidden fruit to Adam, "he scrupl'd not to eat / Against his better knowledge, not deceiv'd, / But fondly overcome with Female charm" (IX, 997-99).1 However much of the complexity of the events leading to Adam's fall this concise analysis may omit, the contrast it states is clear enough. Adam disobeys God in order to be with Eve. He is not deceived. On the assumption that Milton took his scriptural source seriously ("And Adam was not deceived," I Timothy 2:14) it behooves us to examine Adam's intellectual conduct before the fall with some care, especially in the light of the tendency of many readers to judge him guilty of almost every failure of reason imagin- able. In this essay I want to take seriously the possibility that Adam's knowledge did not fail him until he fell; until, that is, he ate the proffered fruit. This was, I think, Milton's intent, and it is consistent with his saying, in Christian Doctrine, that "the whole law of na- ture" was "implanted and innate" in Man at his creation.2 sihe sin-the eating of the fruit-brought about as one of its effects "the loss or at least the extensive darkening of that right reason, whose function it was to discern the chief good, and which was, as it were, the life of the understanding." And this punishment took place "at the same moment as the fall of man, not merely on the same day."3 It is after the fall, after the advent of "Passions, Anger, Hate, / Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord," that Milton tells us in the poem that "Understanding ruled not" (IX, 1123-27). Yet the doctrine is a hard one, for a poet if not for a philosopher, and like so much of what transpires in Book IX it takes on an air of paradox. Eve, certainly, was deceived, her reason misled "by some fair appearing good" (IX, 354). It is difficult not to think that Adam, too, was deceived, by Eve or by himself, when he chose her (a "fair appearing good") over God. But the poet tells us he was not de- ceived. We are to believe, that is, that Adam "discerned the chief good" even as he-rejected it. How did Milton the poet grapple with 83 ELH Vol. 48 Pp. 83-109 0013-8304/81/0481-083 $01.00 ? 1981 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">the paradox? That is the subject of this essay, and we will approach it by reviewing briefly the sort of knowledge Adam was possessed of, and then by considering Milton's artful handling of the two crucial scenes: that in which Adam permits Eve to work apart on the morning of the fatal day, and that in which he responds-first inwardly, and then aloud-to Eve's offer. Adam's remarkable intuitive knowledge is dramatized exten- sively throughout the early parts of the poem. His explanation of Eve's dream (V, 95-121), for example, shows that he understands Thomistic psychology and its distinction between knowing and doing evil. Dr. Johnson wrote that "Adam's discourse of dreams seems not to be the speculation of a new-created man,"'4 and that of course is the point. Adam has readily in mind before the fall the knowledge that the regenerate will later attain only with labor. It is not full or total knowledge, but God has compensated for its defi- ciencies by giving Adam an ability to ask good questions and to grow in understanding. At his birth he is filled with curiosity about God's ways, as his questions testify. In sharp contrast to Satan, he senses intuitively that he owes his existence not to himself but to some great Maker" pre-eminent in goodness: Thou Sun, said I, fair Light, And thou enlight'n'd Earth, so fresh and gay, Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plains, And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, Tell if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? Not of myself; by some great Maker then, In goodness and in power preeminent; Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, From whom I have that thus I move and live, And feel that I am happier than I know. (VIII, 273-82) This ability to ask good questions is based on an intuitive under- standing- of God's plan, and it even shows itself at times in ques- tions about the wisdom of that plan. Indeed his first conversation consists of his decorous but firm argument with his Creator about his need for a mate to provide him with the "rational delight" of "fellowship." The Almighty is pleased with Adam's exercise of his rational faculties, and he answers him delightedly ("I, ere thou spak'st, / Knew it not good for Man to be alone") in a spirit not unlike that of the Father's earlier answer to the Son's request that mercy be shown to Man ["All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all / As my Eternal purpose hath decreed" (III, 171-72)]. 84 A Case For Adam</page><page sequence="3">This ability to "judge of fit and meet" Adam reveals also in his response to Eve's question about the purpose of the stars: "But wherefore all night long shine these, for whom / This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?" (IV, 657-58). Adam's answer con- tains surprising astronomical knowledge and, more important, a recognition that the creation exists not for Man alone: These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, That Heav'n would want spectators, God want praise; Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep: All these with ceaseless praise his works behold Both day and night. (IV, 674-80) But Adam, like Eve, sometimes needs guidance. When he con- siders those same stars "that seem to roll / Spaces incomprehens- ible ... merely to officiate light / Round this opacous Earth," he wonders "How Nature wise and frugal could commit/ Such dis- proportions" (VIII, 19-23, 26-27). Would it not be "better,"" he asks, to have the earth move instead? It is not a bad question. Copernicus would have sympathized with Adam's parsimonious reasoning. And Raphael does not blame him for asking it, "for Heav'n / Is as the Book of God before thee set, / Wherein to read his wond'rous Works" (VIII, 67-68). But he offers Adam several possible explana- tions of what he sees so as to suggest that the right answer is, from an earthly perspective, unattainable, and the question, therefore, fruitless: "Be lowly wise: / Think only what concerns thee and thy being" (VIII, 173-4). Closer to home, Adam questions God's plan once again, on a matter that does concern his being, when he describes to Raphael the "change" that Eve works on his mind, and tells him how he feels "here only weak / Against the charm of Beauty's powerful glance": Or Nature fail'd in mee, and left some part Not proof enough such Object to sustain, Or from my side subducting, took perhaps More than enough; at least on her bestow'd Too much of Ornament, in outward show Elaborate, of inward less exact. (VIII, 534-39) The exchange between Adam and Raphael has been variously interpreted, sometimes with an emphasis on its revelation of the John Reichert 85</page><page sequence="4">nature and strength of Eve's power over Adam, sometimes with an emphasis on its revelation of Adam's knowledge of his weakness, and hence of his preparedness for whatever might ensue. It is im- portant, I think, to see the interpretations as complementary, and to give each its full weight. Arnold Stein and Stanley Fish lay great stress on Adam's use of the word "seems" in the following passage: When I approach Her loveliness, so absolute she seems And in herself complete, so well to know Her own, that what she wills to do or say, Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best; (VIII, 546-550) According to Stein, Adam "presents his whole extravagant praise of Eve deliberately as an illusion, one that he presumes to control by his formal daylight knowledge of reality," but "the illusion that is enjoyed in spite of formal disapproval corrupts the control of reality."5 For Stein it is as if Adam uses seems to give full play to his imaginings, acting out his fall before it occurs. For Fish, "Higher knowledge has not fallen degraded in Eve's presence, and, because the possibility has been noted, it is less likely to fall in the future. The delicacy (not frailty) of Adam's understanding is mirrored in the word 'seems', a verbal extension of his will through which he controls the illusion of Eve's superiority by insisting on its status as illusion."6 But in fact it is only the syntax of five lines of the passage that is governed by "seems," after which Adam uses a forceful, unquali- fied declarative: All higher knowledge in her presence falls Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her Loses discount'nanc't, and like folly shows; Authority and Reason on her wait, As one intended first, not after made Occasionally; and to consummate all, Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat Build in her loveliest, and create an awe About her, as a guard Angelic plac't. (VIII, 551-59) Adam, in his allegorizing of knowledge, wisdom, authority, and reason, speaks not of what has happened, or of what might happen or seems to happen, but of what does happen. He "well under- stands" that "in the prime end / Of Nature" Eve is "th' inferior" 86 A Case For Adam</page><page sequence="5">(540-41), and he knows that she was not "intended first." But he also knows, nevertheless, that "Wisdom in discourse with her/ Loses discount'nanc't." It is this forceful presentation of what does happen to him "against his better knowledge" that justifies Raphael's stern warning: Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part; Do thou but thine, and be not diffident Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou Dismiss not her, when most thou need'st her nigh, By attributing overmuch to things Less excellent, as thou thyself perceiv'st. (VIII, 561-66) To say that Adam's higher knowledge has fallen, and does fall, degraded in Eve's presence is not to say that Adam has fallen, or that he is likely to. To fall is to disobey God's sole command. But Adam has demonstrated for us that he is capable of falling, and that he knows it. As Fish rightly insists, Adam and Eve's "ability to fall" is "the necessary complement of their ability not to fall"7-the necessary complement, one might add, of their freedom. In his answer to Raphael Adam correctly describes his own present moral state in terms that echo his earlier explanation of Eve's dream. To Raphael he says: I to thee disclose What inward thence I feel, not therefore foil'd, Who meet with various objects, from the sense Variously representing; yet still free Approve the best, and follow what I approve. (VIII, 607-61 1) Whatever "external things" the "watchful senses represent" to us, he had said to Eve, "Evil into the mind of God or Man / May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave / No spot or blame behind" (V, 103-104, 117-19). The tense simultaneity, at this point, of Adam's knowledge of his actual response to Eve and his knowledge of the response he ought to have could not be greater. It is a sign of the fullness of his knowledge. He has not known (experienced) evil, but he has known and understood feelings within himself which, if "approved" and acted upon, could, and later do, lead him to dis- obey God's command. As we approach the Fall yet more closely, it becomes more diffli- cult to assess the state of Adam's knowledge-or at least so the John Reichert 87</page><page sequence="6">history of Milton criticism would suggest. This is so, in part, be- cause both Adam and Eve enunciate ideas that seem to echo Mil- ton's, or God's, or those of scripture itself, yet many readers wish to find, in their prelapsarian words and actions, causes for the fall- what Fish calls "an intelligible sequence of events" that will re- move its mystery, its "incomprehensibility."8 A prime case in point is the intricate and subtly dramatic conversation in which Eve sug- gests that they divide their labors and spend the morning work- ing apart. During the course of the conversation Eve's motive for separation changes from a desire to get more work done to a desire, in the words of the Argument to Book IX, "to make trial of her strength." Once Adam has permitted Eve to work alone, Stein tells us, "the eating of the apple is as good as done," and Adam is "as good as fallen."9 I hope to show, on the contrary, that during the scene both Eve and Adam grow in knowledge and hence in virtue 10 The conversation is dramatic because its course is dictated not entirely by logic, but also by feeling. Prior to the two concluding speeches each speech expresses incomplete thought and feeling. Adam and Eve say both more and less than they intend, and their ways of "taking" each other's remarks are slightly, and very realisti- cally, askew. Thus, for example, Adam, in his response to Eve's initial suggestion, introduces an issue that nothing in Eve's remarks could have prompted: But if much converse perhaps Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield. For solitude sometimes is best society, And short retirement urges sweet return. (IX, 247-250) It is a touching moment of diffidence that is perfectly in keeping with his earlier and charmingly expressed fear that his own "con- verse" may not entertain Raphael sufficiently to keep him from departing. At the worst one might say that it is a sign of a failure in Adam's proper self-esteem. At least it is a sign of feelings at work below the surface of the discussion. But this particular doubt, like the initial question of how best to fulfill their assigned task in the garden, is dropped and does not reappear. Adam proceeds to ex- press 'other doubt": "lest harm / Befall thee sever'd from me." This doubt Adam expresses in loving, courteous, protective terms: Leave not the faithful side That gave thee being, still shades thee and protects. 88 A Case For Adam</page><page sequence="7">The Wife, where danger or dishonor lurks, Safest and seemliest by her Husband stays, Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. (IX, 265-69) What goes on in Eve's mind here we cannot know, and cannot guess at without imposing greater certainty on the dialogue than Milton wishes us to possess. What we know is simply that Eve construes Adam's remarks as an "unkindness, choosing not to hear the affection in his tone but to hear instead what is also, implicitly, there: the negative but logical corollary of his protectiveness: His fraud is then thy fear, which plain infers Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; (IX, 285-87) And in presenting that inference she also expresses her sense of having been offended. Adam has, without meaning to, put her in a bind, and she puts him in another: But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt To God or thee, because we have a foe May tempt it, I expected not to hear. (IX, 279-81) Thoughts, which how found they harbor in thy breast, Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear? (IX, 288-89) Adam, instead of acknowledging (as he had earlier) that either of them could be shaken or seduced, chooses to respond by trying to calm her anxiety about his doubt of her firmness. In doing so, he raises what seems to be a new and not altogether relevant issue: Not diffident of thee do I dissuade Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid Th' attempt itself, intended by our Foe. For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses The tempted with dishonor foul, suppos'd Not incorruptible of Faith, not proof Against temptation. (IX, 293-99) Now it is possible to construe Adam's prior speech as meaning just this; he is not necessarily contradicting himself. But because the earlier speech does not specify the nature of the "harm" or "danger" feared, the effect of the new formulation is to diminish John Reichert 89</page><page sequence="8">the threat, turning it into a question of "dishonor" coming from without rather than one of failure from within. At this point Adam shifts the grounds of his argument (though Eve will return to the question of "aspersion"), urging Eve not to underestimate the "malice and false guile" of that very Enemy "who could seduce / Angels." He acknowledges the strength he feels and would manifest in her presence, but concludes with a question which, though reasonable and just, may at the same time reveal some trepidation about the reciprocity of their love: Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel When I am present, and thy trial choose With me, best witness of thy Virtue tri'd. (IX, 315-17) Eve does not quite answer Adam's question. Instead she seems to distill her entire sense of Adam's variously expressed reasons for their remaining together into a series of powerful questions of her own, each of which has won wholehearted approval from some readers, and condemnation from others. Whether her questions are legitimate or not (and I will argue that they are), they elevate the discussion by directing it toward the central issue of the ultimate nature of their "condition" and the grounds on which their "happy State" depends: If this be our condition, thus to dwell In narrow circuit strait'n'd by a Foe, Subtle or violent, we not endu'd Single with like defense, wherever met, How are we happy, still in fear of harm? But harm precedes not sin: only our Foe Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem Of our integrity: his foul esteem Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns Foul on himself; then wherefore shunn'd or fear'd By us? who rather double honor gain From his surmise prov'd false, find peace within, Favor from Heav'n, our witness from th' event. And what is Faith, Love, Virtue unassay'd Alone, without exterior help sustain'd? Let us not then suspect our happy State Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, As not secure to single or combin'd. Frail is our happiness, if this be so, And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd. (IX, 322-41) 90 A Case For Adam</page><page sequence="9">Dennis Burden claims that Eve's first question ("How are we happy, still in fear of harm?") "indicts God's providence."" As I see it, however, she would be indicting God's providence only if she agreed to the hypothetical description of their condition. But she does not. She is attributing the description to Adam, sum- marizing her sense (whether accurate or not) of his presentation of their condition. Her question is very much in the spirit of Au- gustine's when he argues that Adam and Eve could not have felt such emotions as fear in the happy state of paradise: "For if they did feel any such, how were they happy in that never-to-be-forgot- ten place of happiness called paradise? Who indeed can be called completely happy if he suffers fear or grief?"'"2 As her subsequent lines indicate, Eve disputes what she considers to be an erroneous view of their Edenic situation. What she is asking, as I read her lines, is simply whether each of them, alone, is not "endu'd" with sufficient "defense" against the Foe. If they are not-if, that is, they can only defend against the Foe when together-then she would consider their condition unhappy. But she has clearly expressed her conviction that her own "Faith and Love" are firm enough to withstand shaking or seduction. It is possible, if one reads the word "like" in line 325 as meaning "equal" or "identical," to attribute to her a demand that there be no distinction whatsoever between their defenses. But such a wish has not surfaced before in the dialogue, and nothing in the poem suggests that her defenses are not suffi- ciently similar to Adam's to render her "sufficient to have stood." She is, God says to Adam, "Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self' (VIII, 450). The narrator calls her "Virtue-proof' (V, 384) when, naked, she greets the angel Raphael. She, like Adam, is "free to fall," and like Adam she does fall. It is not that she cannot resist the temptation, but that she does not. That she is free-free to obey or disobey God or Adam, and free to regard or disregard her warnings-seems to me a fact on which the ensuing action, and indeed Milton's full justification of God's plan, clearly rests.13 Eve proceeds-correctly, I think-to remind Adam, in response to his claim that the Foe's attempt itself would asperse her "with dishonor foul," that "harm precedes not sin." She need not fear harm provided she not sin. Her next question, as many readers have recognized, sounds very like Milton's own opinion as he expressed it in Areopagitica: And what is Faith, Love, Virtue unassay'd Alone, without exterior help sustain'd? John Reichert 91</page><page sequence="10">As therefore the state of man now is, what wisdom can there be to choose, what continence to forbear without the knowledge of evil? He that can apprehend and consider vice with all her baits and seeming pleasures, and yet abstain, and yet distinguish, and yet prefer that which is truly better, he is the true warfaring Christian. I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and unbreathed, that never sallies out and sees her adversary, but slinks out of the race where that immortal garland is to be run for, not without dust and heat.14 Scholars have been at pains to dissociate Eve's thinking from Milton's, pointing out correctly that in Areopagitica Milton was speaking of fallen man ("As therefore the state of man now jS').15 But this difference is not sufficient to repudiate Eve's question. Adam and Eve have already received the kind of knowledge of evil that Milton is referring to: the knowledge of what evil is and of how it can "appear" to be good. Both have experienced an inclination to sin. Both have been tempted, in their dreams, to eat of the fruit,'6 but, as Adam says, "Evil [whether in Paradise or in our present state] May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave / No spot or blame behind." In Eve's words, ""Harm precedes not sin." If Milton can- not praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, so God asks-and his words apply to pre- as well as to post-lapsarian Man: Not free, what proof could they have giv'n sincere Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love, Where only what they needs must do, appear'd, Not what they would? what praise could they receive? (III, 103-106) Eve is asking for a chance to give proof of her "constant Faith or Love," her "firm Faith and Love," as she echoes God in line 286. God sees their freedom as necessary if they are to receive His "praise" for withstanding temptation. Eve, too, knows that their actions can obtain "Favor from Heav'n, our witness from th' event," only if they are performed "without exterior help"-that is, freely. And it should be added that in the last five lines of her speech, while she can conceive of the possibility of God's making an "imperfect" state for them (as Adam had done earlier), she does not think he has done so. The most skeptical interpretation one could put on her lines would be to suspect that by "secure" she means "absolutely invulnerable," and that she may not see that their hap- piness is frail, even though she is sufficient in herself to stand. Adam, in his grand answer to her, does not refute anything that Eve has said. Instead he clarifies the terms (like "secure") that she 92 A Case For Adam</page><page sequence="11">has already used, and emphasizes, in perfect balance, both the na- ture of the danger and the nature of Reason as their defence. In doing so he corrects his own earlier stress on danger from without. He does not for a minute, by the way, suggest that Eve has not been given Reason, a "like defense" to his, wherewith to distinguish between real and apparent good. His entire speech, as Fish has said, is "essentially an expansion of God's 'sufficient to have stood, though free to fall'."'`7 I want to underline the word entire because Adam's last six lines are usually read as a crucial failure on his part: But if thou think, trial unsought may find Us both securer than thus warn'd thou seem'st, Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; Go in thy native innocence, rely On what thou hast of virtue, summon all, For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. (IX, 370-75) Here, Stein writes, Adam "approves her will though against his reason.'8 According to Burden, he is "overcome" by Eve's argu- ment, and fails "to see through it." "For all his intelligence and shrewdness, he does let her go."19 According to Summers, Adam: suddenly dismisses reason, ignores his "better knowledge," abdicates his responsibility ... He sees the question of their separation ... as if it merely concerned whether she is "with him" at this moment ... Now he cares more for her immediate approval of him than he does for her ultimate safety; he prefers the risk of her destruction to the risk of her momentary resent- ment.20 But I answer that the similarity of Adam's last words ("God to- wards thee hath done his part, do thine") to Raphael's words to him ("Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part, / Do thou but thine") should put us on guard against too hasty a dismissal of our grand- parent's wisdom. Rather, he is properly accepting and fulfilling his appointed place in the hierarchy. As God (and Raphael) are to him, so is he to Eve. After warning her fully (as God had warned them both) he rightly insists upon her freedom. He is not "merely con- cerned" with whether she is with him, but with the terms on which her action rests. He does not "prefer the risk of her destruction to the risk of her momentary resentment." He prefers risking a chal- lenge to her strength to forcing her to remain. As her superior, his phrase "Thy stay, not free, absents thee more" strikes me as a per- John Reichert 93</page><page sequence="12">fectly human, domestic version of God's "What praise could they receive? / What pleasure I from such obedience paid, / When Will and Reason ... had serv'd necessity, / Not me" (III, 106-111). Adam, in his concluding words, finds "better knowledge," and does what we ought to, but apparently do not, want him to do. The entire scene, like Adam and Raphael's discussion of the ef- fects of Eve's physical and spiritual beauty, dramatizes, illustrates, and describes the presence of thoughts and feelings which, if "ap- proved," might result in disobedience. And, like the earlier scene, it simultaneously dramatizes their achievement of understanding and control. Adam and Eve together, as they explore the implica- tions of Eve's initial suggestion, grow toward knowledge. That Adam is right to let Eve go, and that she falls, are facts that we must accept in conjunction if we are to do justice to the tragic nature of their fall and not reduce it to a simple exemplum (a warn- ing to husbands to look well to their wives). Likewise we must recognize that Eve is right, even in her most fallen state, to reject Adam's locating the blame for their transgression in her "desire of wand'ring" (IX, 1136), though wrong when she immediately con- tradicts herself and blames him for permitting her to wander. And Adam is right when he answers: And am I now upbraided, as the cause Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold The danger, and the lurking Enemy That lay in wait; beyond this had been force, And force upon free Will hath here no place. (IX, 1168-74) What is wrong in their analyses here is that they reduce the complexity of the event, ignoring their own separate acts of dis- obedience to God ("neither self-condemning") and searching for earlier, easier explanations. When God later rebukes them, he re- fers not to their separating at all but to their eating of "the Tree / Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat" (X, 122-23), and to Adam's "Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eat" (X, 143). We arrive, finally, at the point where Adam is confronted by an already fallen Eve, and if ever Adam needed help it is here. Milton has designed his response with extraordinary delicacy and care. Adam is not "persuaded" to join Eve in sin, nor does he persuade himself Eve's arguments do not enter his thinking until after his 94 A Case For Adam</page><page sequence="13">decision has been firmly made. He simply wills, resolves, chooses, to join her. Given the fullness of that "better knowledge" we have seen him to possess, his willful choice is structurally similar to Macbeth's, in that scene (I, vii) where, after a twenty-eight line soliloquy in which he reveals his better knowledge, and with only the vaguest clues as to the psychological process involved, he flies in the face of that knowledge: "I am settled, and bend up / Each corporal agent to this terrible feat." Adam's resolution is, if any- thing, more mysterious than Macbeth's because he remains more acutely aware of the nature and consequences of his act even as he determines upon it. And, from the reader's point of view, it is more complex because it is, to a degree we should not underestimate, an act of love-tragically misdirected love, but love nonetheless. Mac- beth, as distinct from Adam, never describes the "good" he seeks in positive terms.2' Adam's single, crucial failure appears immediately in the very first words he utters to himself as he stands "speechless ... and pale" before his fallen spouse: 0 fairest of Creation, last and best Of all God's Works, Creature in whom excell'd Whatever can to sight or thought be form'd, Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! (IX, 896-99) These lines contradict, explicitly and directly, the knowledge he had earlier expressed to Raphael: "For well I understand in the prime end / Of Nature her th' inferior" (VIII, 540-41). The warning of Raphael's that he fails to heed is precisely this: Weigh with her thyself; Then value: Oft-times nothing profits more Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right. (VIII, 570-72) In God's words he forgets that his own "perfection far excell'd / Hers in all real dignity" (X, 150-51). He esteems Eve above himself, and that fact, while it defines his sin, has for countless readers colored his act with a decidedly romantic appeal.22 He has not been, as Eve was, deceived by specious arguments. He knowingly chooses Eve "against his better knowledge." He makes the choice unhesitatingly and in full knowledge that its consequence will be his ruin: John Reichert 95</page><page sequence="14">How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, Defac't, deflow'r'd, and now to Death devote? Rather how hast thou yielded to transgress The strict forbiddance, how to violate The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! some cursed fraud Of Enemy hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, And mee with thee hath ruin'd, for with thee Certain my resolution is to Die. (IX, 900-907) Fish sees Adam in these lines as engaged in a subtle process of self-deception: At first his participles ('Defac't, deflow'r'd') make Eve the victim of an evil external to her; but Adam, who knows very well what must have happened, immediately corrects the distortion in his language with the word 'rather', and returns the responsibility to her: 'how hast thou yielded'. Yet within three lines, Eve is again the object of the action ('beguil'd'), which ruins her and with her Adam, who enters into a conspiracy with himself by pretending to believe in his own linguistic sleight of hand. To protect him- self from pain he has conferred on the act of disobedience a meaning he will feel comfortable with: Eve does not sin, she is undone by 'some cursed fraud.'23 But this hardly seems fair to Adam or true to the sense of amaze- ment and astonishment that his lines convey and that makes elabo- rate pretense unlikely. His participles describe the appearance of Eve's face ("But in her Cheek distemper flushing glow'd") and do not in fact designate an agent, either external or internal. Further- more, Eve has yielded and she has been beguiled by "some cursed fraud/ Of enemy." Both attributions are true, and either alone would be incomplete. When God asks Eve what she has done, she answers, quoting scripture, "The serpent me beguil'd and I did eat" (X, 162), and God does not say her nay. He Himself had said "Man falls deceiv'd / By th' other first" (III, 130-31). Adam, like Eve, needs two clauses to designate the two participating agents, and there is no indication that he suppresses either truth. Adam proceeds to explain his decision to himself in a deeply moving restatement of his reasons for asking God for a companion "fit and meet" to end his solitude and partake with him of all the good which God's "hands so liberal" had provided. Here are the two passages: I now see Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self 96 A Case For Adam</page><page sequence="15">Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man Extracted; for this cause he shall forgo Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soul. How can I live without thee, how forgo (VIII, 494-99) Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly join'd, To live again in these wild Woods forlorn? Should God create another Eve, and I Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee Would never from my heart; no no, I feel The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. (IX, 909-916) Both passages follow Genesis ii, 23, 24 closely, though each ex- pands upon it in a direction that is consistent with the spiritual interpretation Milton gives to the words "bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh" in Tetrachordon (see below). In the Argument to Book IX Milton wrote that Adam acted "through vehemence of love," and that seems right enough. "Sweet converse and love so dearly join'd," and the refusal to live again forlorn, catch nicely Milton's often reiterated conception of the "prime and principle scope of marriage: And what his chief end was of creating woman to be joined with man, his own instituting words declare, and are infallible to in- form us what is marriage, unless we can think them set there to no purpose: "It is not good," saith he, "that man should be alone. I will make him a helpmeet for him." From which words so plain, less cannot be concluded, nor is by any learned interpreter, than that in God's intention a meet and happy conversation is the chiefest and the noblest end of marriage, for we find here no expression so necessarily implying carnal knowledge as this prevention of loneliness to the mind and spirit of man.24 Dennis Burden has argued that Adam's desire for Eve's "sweet Converse and Love" is "absurd." His resolve to join Eve, he says, "does not lead to love and amity for its outcome is death and de- spair. There can be no true society in sinfulness. The upshot of the Fall, Adam and Eve's quarrel and mutual recriminations, provides a logical and ironical end to what Adam is here calling their 'sweet Converse and Love'."25 But this is surely a narrow view of the "upshot" of the Fall. Adam's assessment of Eve in this regard re- ceives full justification when, in Book X, it is she whose sweet John Reichert 97</page><page sequence="16">converse and love recover him from the depths of despair, anger, pride, and resentment into which he has fallen (X, 909-946), and when he hears her words, "well pleas'd," as they join hands to leave Eden, solitary and together. Fish simply finds Adam's "appropriation" of Genesis "irrelevant, an instance of the devil, or someone about to enter his service, quoting scripture."26 Of course it may be so, but it may not. Adam's love is selfish-a version of his initial "selfish" request for companionship, but intensified by his knowledge ofjust how sweet that companionship is. He does it clearly for himself, not for Eve. But it is selfless, too, in the sense that he is willing, knowing what he knows, to be ruined rather than to live without her. I see no way to do justice to the complexity of Adam's act, and of its conse- quences, other than with the aid of paradox: Adam does the wrong thing for good reasons.27 The reasons do not make the act right,. nor does the act make the reasons base. The result of the act will be the experiential knowledge of evil and death. It will also be the pros- pect of a paradise "happier far" and the promise, for the faithful, that they will be received "into bliss, / Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth / Shall all be Paradise, far happier place / Than this of Eden, and far happier days" (XII, 462-65). Some of the difficulties of Adam's interior monologue, and of the speech which follows, in which Adam is "as one from sad dismay / Recomforted," arise from the very concept of deceit itself. To acquiesce in Milton's assertion that Adam fell "not deceived" we must take it in its narrow sense. He knows that he is doing wrong, and no one deceives him. At the same time, his description of Eve as "fairest of Creation, last and best / Of all God's works" is, in the poem's terms, inaccurate. His appraisal of her is at odds with Raphael's, with God's, and with his own better knowledge. But the balance is delicate. He appraises her according to his sense, based on experience, of her value to him. It is a misappraisal he has described to us, and one that we have almost heard him make be- fore, though in tones so utterly winning that we pass over them without suspicion: "Best Image of myself and dearer half' (V, 95); "Sole Eve, Associate sole; to me beyond / Compare above all living Creatures dear" (IX, 227-28). Indeed the very first words we hear him utter to Eve seem, in retrospect, to sway on the balance: "Sole partner and sole part of all these joys, / Dearer thyself than all" (IV, 411-12). The difference is simple. In Book IX the appraisal is transmuted into action. 98 A Case For Adam</page><page sequence="17">But Adam is not mistaken on this one count alone. He does not know, or does not think of, everything he might. The narrator de- scribes him as "submitting to what seem'd remediless." He does not consider alternative courses of action. In the words of the mar- ginal gloss on Genesis iii, 7 in the Geneva Bible, "they soght not to God for remedie." And when, "in calm mood," he turns to Eve, he apparently accepts her description of the effect of the fruit on the serpent as accurate. Here, after having resolved to die, Adam yields, indirectly, to Satan's deception: Yet so Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact Is not so heinous now, foretasted Fruit, Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first Made common and unhallow'd ere our taste; Nor yet on him found deadly, he yet lives, Lives, as thou said'st, and gains to live as Man Higher degree of Life, inducement strong To us, as likely tasting to attain Proportional ascent, which cannot be But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. (IX, 927-37) Yet even here, I think, we must be careful not to oversimplify the state of Adam's knowledge by ignoring the sense in which his lines express truth. We can stress, if we wish, the sense in which they are only ironically true: he is not aware of their full implications. But we should also and equally stress their congruence with the divine plan according to which this is a fortunate fall. Anne Ferry sees ambition in the lines quoted above28, and she may be right, though naming something as an inducement suggests an objectivity, a speculativeness, that "&lt;ambition" doesn't quite catch. Adam is at- tempting to place the happiest construction possible on the act he is about to commit. In doing so his hope reveals an intuitive "better knowledge" than he can yet understand. He and Eve do, of course, become as Gods ["O Sons, like one of us Man is become / To know both Good and Evil, since his taste / Of that defended Fruit" (XI, 84-86)], though in a sense, and for a reason, that Adam cannot know. Nor can he understand when he tells Eve "Perhaps thou shalt not die," that they will and will not die. That is the hard, hard lesson he will learn under Michael's tutelage. He does not know the full "remedy" God has in store: so Death becomes His final remedy, and after Life John Reichert 99</page><page sequence="18">Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd By Faith and Faithful works, to second Life, Wak't in the renovation of the just, Resigns him up with Heav'n and Earth renew'd. (XI, 61-66) But true to his intelligence he will catch a glimmer of the promise even before Michael arrives to tell him that his Lord may "Redeem [him] quite from Death's rapacious claim" (XI, 258). Aided by grace and prayer he begins to suspect that "the bitterness of death / Is past, and we shall live" (XI, 157-58). Beneath Adam's thinking, in other words, even as he persists in his determination to disobey God's command, there can be seen a continuing though twisted thread of faith in God's benevolence: Nor can I think that God, Creator wise Though threat'ning, will in earnest so destroy Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high, Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, For us created, needs with us must fail, Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, Be frustrate, do, undo, and labor lose, Not well conceiv'd of God, who though his Power Creation could repeat, yet would be loath Us to abolish, lest the Adversary Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God Most Favors, who can please him long? Mee first He ruin'd, now Mankind; whom will he next? Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe. (IX, 938-51) Here, all critics agree, Adam falls thoroughly apart. Anne Ferry finds him guilty of blasphemy and "the absurd pride to think as Satan does that the fame of the Creator should depend upon the fate of the creature."29 Stein agrees: "It is a full expression of Satan's mind, presuming to understand by reasoning from self."30 But there are two problems with this analysis, if we keep the argument of the whole poem in view. The first is that Adam is, in large measure, right. The second is that his reasoning resembles very closely not Satan's but the Son's, when he urges the Father to be gracious to Man: For should Man finally be lost, should Man Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd With his own folly? that be from thee far, That far be from thee, Father, who art Judge 100 A Case For Adam</page><page sequence="19">Of all things made, and judgest only right. Or shall the Adversary thus obtain His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfil His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, Or proud return though to his heavier doom, Yet with revenge accomplish't and to Hell Draw after him the whole Race of mankind, By him corrupted? or wilt thou thyself Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, For him, what for thy glory thou hast made? So should thy goodness and thy greatness both Be question'd and blasphem'd without defense. (III, 150-66) The fame of the creator, it would seem, does depend upon the fate of the creature. Adam is reasoning from self, and reasoning strangely well, just as he had done when he asked God for a mate and later when he permitted Eve to work alone. Neither Adam nor the Son can believe that the Father in his wisdom would let the "Adversary" triumph. Both recognize the importance of this creation-Man-in God's plan. Both point to the criticism that would follow upon God's "uncreating" or "unmaking" his creation, as does Moses in the passage that has been cited as a likely source for the Son's speech-the passage where Moses argues with God to show mercy to his people: And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.... Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilder- ness. And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy....31 There is, of course, the greatest possible difference between the situations of the two speakers. The Son, the "second Adam," is about to offer himself as a sacrifice for Man, and Adam is about to commit the very sin that calls forth that sacrifice. On the basis of this fact, one might be tempted to speak of Adam's speech as a parody of the Son's. But the matter is not that simple. It is, rather, an imperfect version of it. We can fault Adam's reasoning by pointing out that he calls himself and Eve God's prime Creatures (which they are not), and yet even this mistake has another side to it. Adam John Reichert 101</page><page sequence="20">testifies to his sense of the great "dignity" God has bestowed upon them, and of how much their welfare must mean to Him. Adam recognizes before he falls what Satan, with deep regret, remembers only after he falls: "My remembrance from what state / I fell, how glorious once above thy [the sun's] sphere" (IV, 38-39). As Adam cannot know the sense in which he and Eve both will and will not die, so he does not know that God will first "destroy" them and then through his grace give them the opportunity to recreate them- selves. He will say to Eve before he falls, "If Death / Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life." He is willing to embrace Death's bride as the only source of life to him. And he will come to know that she is the source of life, not for him alone but for Man: Whence Hail to thee, Eve rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind, Mother of all things living, since by thee Man is to live, and all things live for Man. (XI, 158-161) For all the differences between the Son's speech and Adam's, then, Adam has within himself a knowledge of God's intentions beyond anything he has been told. He has not yet fallen, though he is fully resolved to fall. The knowledge he lacks-of death and second life, of destruction and renewal-is precisely the knowl- edge his subsequent experience, and Michael's teaching, will sup- ply. What he now sees through a glass darkly will not be set in its true light until Michael has "from Adam's eyes the Film remov'd / Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight / Had bred" (XI, 412-14), an image which suggests not only how the false Fruit blinds him but also how capable he was of seeing before he tasted it. What he lacks, which only Grace can supply, is foresight; that is, Providence. Nor does he, in his last words to Eve before he sins, let his speculations delude him into thinking they are immune from death: However I with thee have fixt my Lot, Certain to undergo like doom; if Death Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; So forcible within my heart I feel The Bond of Nature draw me to my own, My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; Our State cannot be sever'd, we are one, One Flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself. (IX, 952-59) 102 A Case For Adam</page><page sequence="21">These lines reiterate the resolution, and the motive, expressed in his "inward" monologue, and similarly recall his very first response to the sight of Eve. It seems to me that there can be little doubt that Adam is marrying Eve again: marrying her into fallen life, and into death, forgoing his Father for "bliss or woe,"? or, in the words of the marriage ceremony, "in prosperity and adversity," "for better, for worse." For me it is simply nonsense to think, with Burden, that Milton, for all his arguments on behalf of liberalized divorce laws, would have thought that Adam's proper "remedy is divorce": "What he should do is to leave her. He would have good grounds for divorce."32 As I pointed out earlier, Eve will right their marriage and prove a fit help and comfort: "While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps ['til death us depart'], Between us two let there be peace, both joining, / As joined in injuries" (X, 923-25). Critics who wish to see Adam as thoroughly fallen (and confused) before he falls argue that he is marrying for what Milton would have regarded as the wrong reason, as if the fact that Adam does not repeat in his last lines the idea of "sweet converse and love" indi- cates that his attraction is now degraded. Stein, for example, calls Adam's choice a "choice of flesh": "When the crisis comes Adam's reactions are in terms of the 'Link of Nature'-the flesh of flesh and bone of bone. Individuality and love are reduced to the limits of the flesh and bone."33 But such critics must twist Milton's unequivocal interpretation of Adam's words "bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh" as they occur in Genesis. In Tetrachordon Milton says that Adam spoke these words: in reference to those words which God pronounc't before; as if he had said, this is she by whose meet help and society I shall be no more alone; this is she who was made my image, ev'n as I the Image of God; not so much in body, as in unity of mind and heart. And he might as easily know what were the words of God, as he knew so readily what had bin don with his rib, while he slept so soundly.... Adam spake like Adam the words of flesh and bones, the shell and rinde of matrimony; but God spake like God, of love and solace and meet help, the soul both of Adam's words and of matrimony.34 That is, in Milton's view Adam's words, though on the surface they describe "the shell and rinde of matrimony," in fact mean what God meant, and refer to "the sweet and mild familiarity of love and solace and mutual fitness." Paul, in the passage from Ephesians which was read in the marriage ceremony, likewise John Reichert 103</page><page sequence="22">dwells on flesh and bones, and on the body, and gives them a spiritual meaning: So men are bound to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife, loveth himself. For never did any man hate his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the congregation: for we are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This mystery is great, but I speak of Christ and of the congregation. Nevertheless, let every one of you so love his own wife, even as himself.35 What the passages from Genesis and Ephesians demonstrate is that Adam's concluding expression-"We are one, / One Flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself'-need not be taken as a sign that he is joining Eve for the wrong reason, and in the absence of other evidence it probably should not be so taken. Adam uses, of course, two tantalizing phrases that occur neither in Genesis nor in Tet- rachordon. They are "the Link of Nature" and "The Bond of Na- ture." I am not aware of any helpful gloss on these phrases, though they have been read as meaning something like sexual attraction. Burden, for reasons he does not explain, says that they indicate Adam's "making the lesser part of marriage, the link of nature, take precedence over the greater one of solace and mutual comfort."36 That the couple is about to be "linked" in sin is clear enough. The irony of Eve's reply to Adam's speech underlines that fact. Adam, she says, is "link't in Love so dear / To undergo with mee one Guilt, one Crime" (970-71). But Eve is no more speaking of sexual attrac- tion than Adam is. She hears Adam as speaking of a "Union" of "One Heart, one Soul in both" (966-67). And to that extent she is right. It is a union of two souls who will sin as one. "Carnal desire" and "lust" are a result of Man's first disobedience, not its cause. "Bond" and "link" are not, of course, unusual terms to use in speaking of marriage. Milton himself speaks of "the sacred bond of marriage, "37 and in Christian Doctrine he says that "When human nature was perfect, before the fall, God, in paradise, established marriage as an indissoluble bond [indissolubile coniugium]."38 Hooker speaks of the "bond of wedlock" as necessary in the light of the length of time human beings require to raise their offspring to perfection. "Man and woman being therefore to join themselves for such a purpose, they were of necessity to be linked with some strait and insoluble knot."39 But these phrases fall short of the mark. In 104 A Case For Adam</page><page sequence="23">the absence of other evidence I would like to suggest the possible relevance of Augustine's "copula naturalis -relevant because it applies specifically to Adam and Eve. It comes from the opening paragraph of Augustine's treatise De Bono Conjugali: Forasmuch as each man is a part of the human race, and human nature is something social, and hath for a great and natural good, the power also of friendship; on this account God willed to create all men out of one, in order that they might be held in their society not only by likeness of kind, but also by bond of kindred [cognationis vinculo]. Therefore the first natural bond [copula naturalis] of human society is man and wife. Nor did God Create these each by himself, and join them together as alien by birth: but He created the one out of the other, setting a sign also of power of the union in the side, whence she was drawn, was formed. For they are joined one to another side by side, who walk together, and look together whither they walk.40 The passage strikes me as particularly apt because Milton would have approved of Augustine's emphasis here on society and friendship as the prime end of marriage. The idea expressed in the passage-that the first marriage was instituted between a man and a woman who were literally of one flesh as a sign of the strength of the social union of man and wife-recurs in similar contexts in The City of God. There Augustine writes, for example, that God's pur- pose in creating Eve from Adam's rib was to "bind them, through a bond of kinship, into a united concord based on the link of peace [pacis vinculo]."41 Or again, his purpose was "to ensure that unity of fellowship itself and ties of harmony [vinculum concordiae] might be more strongly [vehementius] impressed on him, if men were bound to one another not only by their similar nature but also by their feeling of kinship."42 Of course we cannot know whether Milton had these ideas in mind, but they do establish the possibility of a different way of reading Adam's lines, a way that is consistent with Milton's at- tributing his decision to "vehemence of love" and with Adam's own reference to Eve's "sweet Converse and Love so dearly join'd," his desire not to be "forlorn." The link of nature that draws him to Eve draws him not to any woman (who might, after all, satisfy the needs of his flesh)-and not, indeed, to another woman made from his own side, could he "another Rib afford"-but to this one woman.43 To stress the sense in which Adam's reasons for choosing to die with Eve have a kind of validity, and to note the degree to which even his rationalizations of his decision contain a degree of pro- John Reichert 105</page><page sequence="24">phetic truth of which he is unaware, is by no means to exonerate him or to suggest that he is not tragically and deeply mistaken in choosing to disobey God's command. What the extent of Adam's better knowledge does suggest, I think, is the great care with which Milton approached an extraordinarily knotty problem, a problem theological in its origins but requiring a literary solution. Man, using the term generically, is half-fallen when Eve comes to Adam with fruit in hand. Adam has not fallen, but is about to fall. And Milton must somehow dramatize both his sinful will and his as yet unfallen knowledge. It is, one might say, easier said than done, easier named than shown. I think that Milton shared Augustine's view of Adam's fall, and his desire to follow scripture in seeing him as undeceived. Augustine's view is worth quoting at some length, both for the sympathetic tenderness of its tone, and for the ease with which the theologian, unburdened by the necessities of drama, can describe it: When we consider the situation of that first man and his woman, two fellow human beings all alone and married to each other, we must suppose that he was not led astray to transgress the law of God because he believed that she spoke the truth, but because he was brought to obey her by the close bond of their alliance [sociali necessitudine]. For the Apostle was not speaking idly when he said: "And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived." He must have meant that Eve had accepted what the serpent said to her as though it were true, while Adam refused to be separated from his sole companion even in a partnership of sin. Yet he was no less guilty if he sinned with knowledge and forethought ... The apostle meant us to understand the deceived as being those who do not think that what they do is sin. Adam, however, knew; otherwise, how can it be true to say: "Adam was not deceived?" But since he was not yet acquainted with the strict justice of God, he might have been mistaken in believing that his offence was pardonable.44 Even Augustine, as this passage makes clear, must struggle to distinguish between being deceived and being mistaken. Milton goes Augustine one better by casting Adam's ignorance of the se- verity of God's justice (Augustine calls him inexpertus divinae severitatis), his "mistake" about the verdict, in a hypothetical mode: "Perhaps thou shalt not die ... Nor can I think.. ." He has Adam act independent of those speculations: "However I with thee have fixt my Lot.. ." The resolution, the choice made by the sinful will, is presented at the beginning of his response-unreasoned 106 A Case For Adam</page><page sequence="25">and hence, strictly speaking, undeceived-and reaffirmed at its conclusion. And the speculations that intervene contain hauntingly accurate premonitions, not unlike the Son's, of God's ultimately gracious plan. It is hard to conceive of a better literary solution to the problem posed by scripture, or of a poetic tact that could do fuller justice to the tragic opposition and struggle inherent in the preposition: Against his better knowledge, not deceived.

But the phrase "pluck and eat" recalls the "he pluck't, he tasted" of Eve's dream, and anticipates the serpent's "to pluck and eat my fill / I spar'd not," and the narrator's description of Eve's act: "she pluck'd, she eat." God awakens Adam from his dream, and Adam comments: "Here had new begun / My wand'ring, had not hee John Reichert 107</page><page sequence="26">who was my Guide / Up hither, from among the Trees appear'd, / Presence Divine" (my italics). We are apparently invited to think of Adam's dream as embodying an instructive temptation to sinful indulgence, instigated by God, analogous to Eve's. Both dreamers awake to be set straight by a guide: Adam, in Eve's case; in Adam's, God, who immediately informs him about the presence, among the trees of Paradise, of the one tree whose fruit he is not to taste. 17Surprised by Sin, p. 238.

Lady Macbeth tries to confuse Macbeth's sense of "what may be- come a man" by telling him that he was a man when he dared to do the deed, and that "to be more than what you were, you would / Be so much more the man." Eve thinks of the serpent as having attained a sort of manhood, and of herself as "growing up to Godhead." Both, that is, pervert the hierarchical order which is portrayed as natural in the worlds they inhabit. What is masterful in Shakespeare's and Milton's handling of these scenes is their refusal to dramatize either husband's decision as the meditated outcome of his wife's arguments. The space between the woman's intentions and the man's decision is logically and causally empty (in sharp contrast, say, with Satan's and Iago's elaborate, step-by-step deceptions of Eve and Othello), even though the men enact their wives' intentions. 22 See, for example, Anne Davidson Ferry, Milton's Epic Voice: The Narrator in Paradise Lost (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1967), p. 60: "His speech is mov- ing, passionate, romantic, but it is never deceived.... His choice is to die with Eve, notfor her, and already his passion is a kind of beautiful self-concern." 23Surprised by Sin, p. 262. 24 The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce, Ch. 2, Complete Poems and Major Prose, pp. 706-707. 25 The Logical Epic, p. 165. 28 surprised by Sin, p. 263. 27 Helen Gardner puts the matter well inA Reading of Paradise Lost (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1965), p. 91: "Having insisted that the mutual love of man and woman is the highest earthly good, that to be 'imparadis'd in one another's arms' is the 'happier Eden', and that in our fallen world the source of 'Relations dear and all the Charities' is to be found in wedded love, Milton gives to Adam a motive it is impossible not to sympathize with, and that sets in the clearest possible light the meaning of the ancient story." 28 Milton's Epic Voice, p. 62. 29Milton's Epic Voice, p. 62. 30Answerable Style, p. 110.
