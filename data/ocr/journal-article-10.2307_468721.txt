<plain_text><page sequence="1">Max Ernst: The Displacement of the Visual and the Verbal Renee Riese Hubert N 1970 appeared a volume of Max Ernst's collected writings.1 As the title might indicate, Ecritures emphasizes the process rather than a finished literary work; writing, moreover, pertains to inventive craftsmanship as opposed to functional typography. The term ecritures epitomizes the manifestation of the self in artistic cre- ation.2 Most texts included in Ecritures first appeared in such publi- cations as La Revolution surrealiste, Le Surrealisme au service de la Revo- lution, Litterature, Le Minotaure, or View, illustrated journals, intro- ducing both verbal and visual material for the sake of interaction and also to provide a dual documentation. In other words, in their orig- inal form of publication, Ernst's texts or drawings, exemplifying or extending other contributions, addressed themselves simultaneously to reader and viewer. His major critical work, Au-dela de la Peinture, a spiritual autobiography, a treatise on collage and frottage, also pro- vides a catalogue of Ernst's major works while juxtaposing text and image in such a way that it becomes impossible to define either a graphic or a textual origin.3 The volume Ecritures, assembling printed texts of considerable variety-poetry, treatises, verbal comments of collage novels, interviews-is covered by mysterious ciphers invented by Ernst himself, a visible language hiding its meaning or relegating it to another world.4 From the Dada period on, Ernst introduced words into his paint- ings or graphic works in more than one way. In his title he often created surprising and mysterious verbal combinations such as "The graminous bicycle" or "Les eclairs au-dessous de quatorze ans" ("Light- nings under fourteen years"). Moreover, he introduced "descriptive" texts into paintings or mixed media which defied any form of com- mentary. The 1923 "Tableau-poeme" suggests by its mere title that it represents as fully as possible the hybrid nature of Max Ernst's art (fig. 1). The poetic text is entirely inscribed on the pictorial surface, apparently turning the canvas into a page.5 Yet, reversely, words occupying squares, dividing them into color zones, create themselves minicanvases. Written on parallel lines, words, however, do not follow for long the apparently rigorous order, for they are mysteriously</page><page sequence="2">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Fig. 1 diverted into the three-dimensional space belonging to painting; let- ters themselves here and there assume volume. Writing and painting, borrowing each other's spatial characteristics, are subject to both con- ventions and at the same time violate them. The written text fosters the creation of spatiality and institutes points of view. The painting, transgressing not only two but three dimensions, can be termed mul- tiplaned; in addition to the flat surface, the receding street endows it with depth; two trumpets produce a forward thrust. Of course the painting is not merely the container of the writing. The viewer recognizes both a landscape and a still life. The receding street is surrounded on both sides by houses whose solid walls curi- 576</page><page sequence="3">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT ously resemble the schemata of another page. In place of a sky, the writing shapes roofs. The alphabet, metamorphosed into block let- ters, assembles and constructs both text and image. In the center two nightingales form a mysterious interlaced sign, the germinal point of all writing. By their surprising visibility the birds have eclipsed the night from which, according to poets and even ornithologists, they cannot be dissociated. In more than one way the landscape abolishes its referentiality to nature and fragments its spatial surfaces. The still life with its bulbs, trumpets, and pears, even if it includes conven- tional components, parodies the very genre it represents. The objects do not by their arrangements shape or solidify space but disperse it. The pears, instead of displaying beauty and harmony, instead of in- ducing the viewer to discover their harmonious structure, appear to shrivel and disintegrate. A white, wavy, rectangular surface, which we can regard as the lowest common denominator of a tablecloth and a page, fails to provide a background or a setting for the object, as though it had been deprived of any function. In spite or perhaps because of the deconstructions and dispersions at work, the "Tableau- poeme" generates an extraordinary dynamism. The text which functions pictorially in a highly creative manner can semantically be defined as descriptive. Paradoxically, it mimics its own creation in the realm of the pictorial. The poem, simulta- neously verbal and visual, engages the reader-viewer into an interplay between the almost indistinguishable original and its representation. Mention of still life, landscape, nightingale, streets alludes to the painting without exhausting it, as though to reveal the inadequacy of verbal representation. This text, with its emphasis on intimacy, pro- tection, mystery, enclosure, parodies to a certain extent Baudelaire's prose poems, especially "L'Invitation au voyage." It paradoxically at- tributes the most "active" role to the still life. Thus the meaning of the text deviates from its own initial premise as well as from the tableau it inscribes and describes. We propose to examine further the interference (almost in the acoustical sense) of visual and verbal elements in Ernst's work by commenting on his illustration of books, an activity far more widely practiced by the painter than the creation of tableaux-poemes. In the three books selected, Ernst's contribution goes beyond purely graphic elements. In Les Malheurs des Immortels, twenty poems accompanying twenty collages, Ernst participated with Eluard in the creation of the texts.6 In an analysis of "Les Ciseaux et leur pere" ("The scissors and their father"), Jean-Charles Gateau shows that from the beginning to the end of the poem, fragments of sentences written by Ernst alternate 577</page><page sequence="4">NEW LITERARY HISTORY with similar verbal contributions by Eluard.7 The collaborators did not concoct their text by sitting around a table, but by correspon- dence. Since the collages were completed before the poems, Eluard, each time he added to the unfinished text, had to respond to words as well as to an image. The poems are themselves collages of small groups of words, composed by each of the two authors, who hardly bothered to correct, let alone censure, one another.8 The collages are composed of fragmented representations, usually borrowed from scientific or technological treatises. The artist stressed the arbitrary quality of his juxtapositions: for instance, the diminutive pine tree, though not rooted in the ground, asserts its upright pos- ture; a man with a bird's head proclaims his bourgeois identity. By giving the same spatial importance to a thimble, a bucket, and a con- stellation, the artist suppresses all hierarchy and thereby eliminates normal relationships. Ernst and Eluard reveal even more clearly the falsity of such relationships by introducing diagrams, maps, anatom- ical charts. These networks of lines appear far more lively than the humans, often represented by a mannequin wearing stiff, ceremonial attire. The spectator dutifully tries to decipher the curbs and, with even less success, endeavors to set into motion the functionless but magic machines that Ernst and Eluard have concocted. The prose poems make their point in a matter-of-fact, journalistic style. By pretending to narrate, to explain, the two poets leave no room for lyricism, or at least the cliches that identify a text as poetic. Moreover, the writers often provide a rapid inventory of fragmentary incidents which have little or no bearing on issues they were supposed to settle. By playing at verbal substitutions, they create a process which closely resembles the collage. The reader is subjected to verbal games consisting mainly of expressions which take on unexpected literal meanings: L'application des serins 'a 1'tude n'a pas de mesures. ("Reveil officiel du serin") [The application of canaries to study knows no bounds. ("The official awakening of the canary")] Mais on ne peut pas etre ivre toute sa vie ("Le Fagot harmonieux") [But you cannot be drunk all your life. ("The harmonious fagot")] The poets constantly introduce paradox and deliberately misdirect our attention. In the collages parts are cut out, thus making us aware of what is fragmented or absent. In the poems similar processes occur 578</page><page sequence="5">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT through repeated references to what has disappeared or what has been forgotten. Moreover, in the collages as in the poems, the natural and the mechanical, the organic and inorganic enter into many sur- prising relations; all barriers seem to disappear. Les Malheurs des Immortels (The Misfortunes of the Immortals) promises paradoxical adventures involving divinities, normally protected against such ups and downs. The first difficulty that the reader- viewer encounters is to recognize these "Immortels," for their day- to-day misfortunes have quite obscured their identities. In the-collage entitled "A la Recherche de l'innocence," Venus emerges, legs first, from a glass bowl, a minimal artificial sea, serving as a womb. In the collage entitled "Mon Petit Mont Blanc," Saturn, recognizable by his ring, is no more than the buttocks of a woman of whom we can see only the breasts and thighs. The Twins, or Gemini, look like prosti- tutes putting on their makeup, right next to Capricorn reduced to an object floating in a bucket. By diminishing these long-established immortals in stature and transforming their spirituality and symbolic prestige into physical needs or mere exhibitionism, the poets replace, subvert, and invert the exemplary values usually associated with clas- sical mythology. The statue, so often the embodiment of the super- human and the universal, becomes a mannequin or an empty piece of clothing in "Le Fugitif," "Les Ciseaux et leur pere," or "Conseils d'ami." In the poems "the divinities" experience similar devaluations, often expressed by reference to change or substitutions: voyez les femmes, a quarante ans, elles laissent leur coeur dans le tronc des pauvres et remplacent les legumes par des attitudes classiques. ("Conseils d'ami") [look at the women, at 40, they leave their heart in the poor-box and replace vegetables with classical poses. ("Friend's advice")] In a single sentence Ernst parodies both classical tradition and ro- mantic love. The Immortal is placed either in an unsuitable situation or is replaced, within recognizable circumstances, by a less exemplary protagonist, such as an object. Such paradoxes are sustained by both text and image. In the poetic texts a certain type of repetition surfaces immediately: the first and last sentences of certain poems are identical ("Des Ev- entails brises" ["The broken fans"]), or several paragraphs begin with 579</page><page sequence="6">NEW LITERARY HISTORY the same sentence pattern ("Les Ciseaux et leur pere"). This minimal concession to standard versification and refrains in the context of this prosaic use of language, in several instances imitating the style of short news items, undermines traditional poetic practice and calls into question the act of repetition. "Des Eventails brises" includes two types of repetition: "les crocodiles d'a present ne sont plus ..." and "il n'y a plus .. .": Les crocodiles d'a present ne sont plus des crocodiles. Ou sont les bons vieux aventuriers qui vous accrochaient dans les narines de minuscules bicyclettes et de jolies pendeloques de glace? Suivant la vitesse du doigt, les coureurs aux quatre points cardinaux se faisaient des compliments. Quel plaisir c'etait alors de s'appuyer avec une gracieuse desinvolture sur ces agreables fleuves saupoudres de pigeons et de poivre! II n'y a plus de vrais oiseaux. Les cordes tendues le soir dans les chemins du retour ne faisaient trebucher personne, mais, a chaque faux obstacle, des sourires cernaient un peu plus les yeux des equilibristes. La poussiere avait l'odeur de la foudre. Autrefois, les bons vieux poissons portaient aux nageoires de beaux souliers rouges. Il n'y a plus de vraies hydrocyclettes, ni microscopie, ni bacteriologie. Ma parole, les crocodiles d'a present ne sont plus des crocodiles. [The crocodiles of today are no longer crocodiles. Where are the good old adventurers who hooked tiny bicycles and beautiful pendants made of ice to your nostrils? According to the speed of the finger, the runners at the four cardinal points paid each other compliments. What a pleasure it was to lean with free and easy grace on these pleasant rivers sprinkled with pigeons and pepper. There are no longer any real birds. The ropes stretching across the way back did not trip anybody up, but at every false obstacle smiles deepened the rings under the eyes of the rope-walkers. Dust smelt like lightning. Formerly, good old fish wore on their fins beautiful red shoes. There aren't any more real hydrobikes, nor microscopy, nor bacteriology. My word, today's crocodiles are no longer crocodiles.] (See fig. 2) Suggesting the void of the present compared to better times, they function as parodies of romantic poems of regret as well as of cliches expressing dissatisfaction. Taken literally they depreciate the past to- gether with the present taken as rhetorical mode of presentation. Words and tropes suggest mechanical reiteration far removed from 580</page><page sequence="7">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT the muscial repetitions characteristic of poetic language: "I1 n'y a plus de vraies hydrocyclettes, ni / microscopie, ni bacteriologie." This state- ment suggests a semantic levelling. The poet may include words po- etic or scientific, imaginary or banal, without producing different meanings and effects. Eliane Formentelli, in an article entitled "Max Ernst-Paul Eluard ou l'impatience du desir," discusses in great detail the relation of text and collages of "La Rencontre de deux sourires" ("The meeting of two smiles") and "Les Ciseaux et leur pere." The following two quo- tations briefly summarize her findings, and have, to a certain degree, guided us in our study of "Des Eventails brises": Entre "la representation de choses" et "la representation de mots" s'est in- staure un trafic qui n'est pas traduction, ni transposition, mais travail, in- scription, jeu ou se joue, dans l'un et l'autre domaine, la trace.... La tech- nique du collage fait taire le rationalisme bavard par un froissement, une egratignure ou une violence des apparences muettes; la r6alisation qu'est le collage devient un champ d'exercice pour la parole ludique de la poesie.9 [Between "representation of things" and "representation of words" a process has arisen which is neither translation nor transposition, but work, inscrip- tion, where in one domain or the other the trace plays its game.... The collage technique silences the chattering of rationalism by means of bruising, scratching, or a violent display of mute appearances; in its manifestations the collage becomes a proving ground for the language game of poetry.] In "Des Eventails brises" repetition binds, to a certain extent, text and collage, since the following words are plastically represented by their respective images: "crocodiles," "bicyclette," "coureurs," "equi- libristes," "cordes tendues," "les quatre points cardinaux." We have 581</page><page sequence="8">NEW LITERARY HISTORY considered "les crocodiles d'a present ne sont plus des crocodiles" a parody of nostalgia. In the context of the collages another set of meanings surfaces, at least partially. The crocodile in its stretched- out position, perhaps far away from water, upside down, with a bi- cycle-like contraption in lieu of its stomach, seems to have relin- quished some of its animal characteristics. Text and collage jointly contribute to the destruction of identity. The crocodile merely repeats the shape and texture of a crocodile; it is nothing but a reproduction. Even if the curved line dividing the space into a lighter and darker zone were to outline waves, the "crocodile" is out of its "element." Known for its threatening power but separated from any meaningful existence and reduced to inaction, it joins the Immortals. The verbal and the visual repeat each other, extend each other. In a sense, each one becomes the impossible replica of the other. Contrasting with the immobilized, "etherized" crocodile, demoted to the rank of a defunctionalized object, the upright cyclist actively pedals away. Contrast or difference soon merges into sameness: the front of the cyclist treacherously resembles a crocodile's scales. How- ever strenuously he pedals, he is no more mobile than the crocodile and just as powerless in displaying energy as the crocodile in dis- playing none. In addition to the cyclist and the crocodile, the collage includes geometrical, abstract, or schematized components. This geo- metrical contraption conveys the image of a machine endowed with a mobility that the cyclist glued to his seat or the stretched-out croc- odile do not possess. Not a single but several positions are conveyed, outlining the direction to and from which the "flying" machine will swing. The painter outlines different positions of the cyclist's hand, both "present" and "absent," establishing relations between the mo- bile bars and the cyclist's hands without indicating whether the hands generate or "repeat" movement. The viewer may have to accept the interference of the arbitrary and irrational, even if their status and nature remain undefined. The title provides additional clues to the interrelations between the parts of the collage. The term eventail refers to an object depending on the unfolding of its parts, according to a given pattern: the cyclist's movable hand, the crocodile's stretched-out legs, the geometrical con- traption are all fan shaped. Consequently one could consider that the collage presents a visual translation (according to more than one method) of the "image" of the fan. Used for cooling, constantly agi- tated back and forth, the fan is subjected to the very movements we have detected in the collage, the pedalling within a spatial confine- ment. "Des Eventails brises" provides a surprising title, as everything represented within it seems remarkably intact. The mutilation, the paralyzing and immobilizing effect comes from the way in which the 582</page><page sequence="9">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT parts of this "machine celibataire" ("machine with sexual analogies") are joined, how they affect each other. In the text as in the collage, we enter into the structure of a gad- getlike contraption, the functioning of which ultimately escapes us: "Autrefois, les bons vieux poissons portaient / aux nageoires de beaux souliers rouges." Fish and men, just as the crocodile and cyclist, be- come interchangeable. They possess no natural affinity, and the above expression does not seem to relate them artificially. The sur- prising juxtaposition merely precludes their eventual separation. Each statement calls upon the reader to grasp a precarious operation vulnerable to its own lack of reality, to follow a path soon to become traceless, to recognize almost totally disguised protagonists. It would seem that Ernst and Eluard have willfully transformed their readers into cyclists (or aviators) pedalling frantically in order to get nowhere, for the more they try to circumscribe them, the more familiar objects will elude them. Just as the collage represents a series of fans and their thwarted movements, so the text reveals a constant attempt at unfolding which inevitably will result in collapse, as lines or words always fall short of providing the expected results. Collage and text, so our chosen ex- ample would indicate, held together only by the title, far from lending themselves to metaphorical parallels, form a single contraption; they cannot be decoded separately but, as already suggested, in terms of their mutual interference. The collage extends the first sentence and even acts as a modifier. The last sentence, except for the introductory "ma parole," merely repeats the first. The whole poem could there- fore serve to prove the veracity of the initial statement, which belies our perceptions and defies all scientific categories. In the context of the collage, it stresses both lack of change and lack of reality. We have to fall back on the same old reproductions or simulacra. Certain words denoting movement surface in these poems which directly refer to visual elements in the collage, thus providing tem- porarily the illusion of a close correspondence by means of brief statements matching aspects of the collage. Verbs such as "accrocher," "appuyer" (to cling to, to support) pertain both to objects that appear in the collage and our tentative effort to decipher the text. As we juxtapose words with certain figures, we contrive collages even more haphazard than those of Max Ernst and Paul Eluard. In 1949 the Copley Gallery in Beverly Hills included in its publi- cation Max Ernst, Ten Years of His Work, Paramyths, a suite of eight collages and eight poems. This illustrated work provides the best examples of Ernst's combined talent as verbal and graphic artist. In 1955 he translated this text, the only one he wrote in English, into his native German, and in 1967 he assisted Robert Valencay with the 583</page><page sequence="10">NEW LITERARY HISTORY French translations, which he later revised for their inclusion in Ecri- tures.'0 The painter's repeated effort to translate and revise his own text would indicate a commitment as a writer most unusual for him. Whereas he made no changes in the collages, he displayed complete freedom in transforming his text from English into other languages. The title itself, the conjunction of two verbal entities, a prefix and a noun, constitutes a verbal collage serving to coin a new word. In this book dealing with myths, Ernst refers to Venus, Pallas Athene, Castor and Pollux, Hercules and others who eventually, in more or less disguised form, also become recognizable in the collages. Since paramyth is unavailable in the dictionary, various word combinations with the same prefix can provide analogies, if not models. On one hand, terms denoting objects, such as parachute, parasol, and paratroop; on the other hand, linguistic or literary terms, such as parable, para- digm, paragraph, paragon, paraphrase, and so forth. If we review the collages, we discover the presence of a parasol used by Hercules (Col- lage 6), a screen shielding a divinity (Collage 5), a parachute barely sustaining a recognizable creature in midair.ll Linguistic and literary terms will also have their relevance: the English poems in their con- cision can be defined as parables with a discrete, somewhat hidden moral. The painter who, as we shall see, borrowed freely from various books to create his collages, and who introduced ready-made expres- sions into his texts, has indeed skillfully mastered the art of para- phrase. Paradox governs Max Ernst's collages, where juxtaposition brings out the incongruous: in the first plate of Paramyths, a youthful divinity and a decayed bird skull together form a statue. If we con- sider the prefix para by itself, it can mean either "near" or "alongside" (spatial location), "similar to" (comparison), "beyond," or "wrongly." We shall discover that Ernst's verbal and visual juxtapositions ex- emplify all these possibilities. The painter, whether he practices "closeness," "similarity," "trespassing," or "opposition," never lets his combinations completely fit together so as to form an organic unit. The reader-viewer soon realizes that for Ernst the game of substi- tution matters more than its possible result. Werner Spies in his Max Ernst Collagen includes book illustrations which the painter borrowed.12 His Venus (Collage 3), his Hercules (Collage 6), his Three Graces (Collage 8) gloss plastically and verbally titles and representations included in Stories of Gods and Heroes.13 By additions and modifications, the painter twists the chronological ref- erences and cultural information provided by the textbook. He creates new verbal and visual adventures at the expense of the divin- ities' timeless past. Hercules' majestic body and frightful club are overshadowed by a huge umbrella burdened with pleats and deco- rations (fig. 3). The "parasol" affords an ironic protection to a hero 584</page><page sequence="11">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT r Fig. 3 whose face has been replaced by the back view of a woman's hair. The muscular and fleshy hero grows not only hair in unexpected places, but friezelike decorations unfit to serve as a shield. Is he still capable of accomplishing his mythical promises now that the distinc- tion between hero and statue has become as shaky as that between body and garment? In addition to the book on gods and heroes, Ernst used a natural history treatise, borrowing bats, wings spread and closed, as well as miscellaneous snails.'4 These "designs in nature," reproduced in Par- amyths in various perspectives and contexts, provide a thread that mysteriously winds and unwinds itself "beside" and "beyond" the im- ages of gods and heroes. Recurrent motifs, having lost their relation 585</page><page sequence="12">586 NEW LITERARY HISTORY __J N1i R, :::':'' : X;:::fi: ' Fig. 4 with nature, belong to a world of dreams and hallucinations. Ernst, in his liberal borrowings, appears to tinker rather than invent, but the transformative process which these borrowings have to undergo reduces them to mere ingredients. In the first collage, images, seemingly fitted into each other, display a series of misfits and disproportions (fig. 4).

Three layers, one be- hind another, or more appropriately on top of one another, compose the plate. The top layer shows the graceful statue of a sun god, holding a sun wheel in one hand, a zigzagging whip in the other. Due to the bulging muscles in both his knees and abdomen, the statue also assumes the characteristics of a live body. The god's nudity emerges as his meandering tunic is barely wider than the whip and</page><page sequence="13">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT the fig leaf merely outlines and frames his penis. In the background, or on the bottom layer, safely hidden from the god's nudity, emerge the eyes, toes, and hands of a stretched-out woman. In between the female figure and the god, pieces of clothing are stacked up, pro- longing one another without forming a unit. The scarcely visible fe- male figure is overwhelmed by clothing as she in turn dwarfs the sun god, who, paradoxically, is strong enough to step on her feet. By their style the clothes belie the Greek "paradigms": a petticoat, a piece of belting, a night jacket, laces, pleats, frill, and collars, suitable to the Victorian age, include nevertheless classical decorative patterns if carefully scrutinized. This night attire stacked up layer by layer offers a protective wall (paravent); although rich in frills and drawn curtains, it suggests indiscretion. A bird's skull crowns and partially replaces the barely visible wom- an's head. This ostentatious yet incomplete substitution provides an ironic example of para as "nearby." A burning candle, modestly echoing the sun, holds the skull in position, a contraption which also serves as lightning rod (paratonnerre). A heavily twisted ram's horn, echoing the meanders of whip and male tunic, replaces the roots or pedestal of the treelike statue. The statue of an identifiable Venus (Collage 3) prolongs the para- phrase of the divinities (fig. 5). The celestial body has shrunk to a candle and her hair assumes the shape of a butterfly. Obliterating her facial features, a diagram, variation of a parabola, shows lines of a magnetic field. We quote Margot Norris's pertinent comment on this Venus: "The lines crudely trace a pattern resembling the orbital shape of eyes and an intersecting nose or proboscis-a pattern sug- gesting the exaggerated and grotesque features of an insect. Ernst might also be using the magnetic field as a scientific analogue of Venus' aesthetic and emotional power to attract and to control."15 This "paragraph," with its oppositions between the scientific and the sensuous, between light and blindness, replaces the myth of love, harmony, and beauty which made Venus immortal. Two hovering, winged mammals have reached different heights and their wings different extensions. What really distinguishes the two mammals is not a matter of degrees but of species (fig. 6). Ernst suggests an ironic parallel between bat and beaver. Whereas Venus is reduced to a candle, bat and beaver occupy regions of the sky, now synonymous with the poles of a magnetic field, paradoxically exerting their power in the same instead of opposite directions. Throughout the series, the paramyths subtly invert similarity and opposition. In the original English version Ernst gave no titles to poems or collages. He refused to provide overt links, at least at that stage. In creating paradoxes without warning, in relating incompatible codes, 587</page><page sequence="14">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Fig. 5 he refrains from using parallel misfits in text and image. In the first English poem, by juxtaposing "Phallas Athene," goddess, and Sade, "the divine marquis," Ernst enhances his phallic divinity. The Greek goddess, chaste according to century-old myths, is made to exchange characteristics with the most famous of all authors of erotic texts. Sexuality, which spells the goddess's downfall, serves as a basis for modern immortality. Rather than imposing wisdom, the goddess be- comes a willing or knowing victim, while the cold calculation of the marquis assumes an air of innocence. The contradictory attributes of the marquis and "marquees," which add up to an accumulation as defunctionalized as the stack of clothes in the plate, deny identity. They imply transgression, yet they never attain any form of fusion. 588</page><page sequence="15">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT Fig. 6 The principle of the collage has been transferred to the text. By including multiple invocations and exclamations, Ernst manipulates the reader for whose benefit he seems to record the reactions of a puzzled or misguided observer. The introductory words of the first English text-"strange hallucinations"-promise distorted realities, matching those of the collage, and justify the discontinuity and frag- mentation of the literary discourse. The poetic text, which neither explains nor imitates, reflects on and magnifies the enigmas of the collages. Ernst adds and suppresses as he transposes from one me- dium to another; as he "cuts out" and "glues on," his verbal trans- position and deconstruction simultaneously decode and cipher visual images. 589</page><page sequence="16">NEW LITERARY HISTORY The third text presents a fairytale opening, proposing as hero a mouse, a creature usually found in fables, about whom we will learn nothing: "Once upon a time there was a mouse / in Milo." In replacing by a purely verbal expression Venus and her best-known statue, which is present in the collage, as well as the prince or princess of fairylore, Ernst deconstructs two acceptable forms of Western cul- ture. His short text leaves the telling of the tale, which might describe how the rodent forced the goddess to take refuge on a pedestal, up to the reader, cast as a perplexed accomplice in the creation of Par- amyths. In the poem facing, the bat and the beaver, the two night creatures, are named Castor and Pollux, demigods known for their resemblance and inseparability, and also as the Gemini, a constellation. Ernst paid special attention to the ambiguity of their names: Castor refers to a beaver; Pollux is linked to pollution, for language, especially poetic language, encourages substitutions in accordance with sound and morphology. But while the collage humorously represents this con- stellation of identical stars, the text dissolves the bond between them by insisting on their eclipse and invisibility. Castor merely leaves foot- prints; Pollux, a by-product of pollution, happily leaves no trace at all. The initial rapport between text and image also disintegrates as the syntax undergoes the same process of dissolution detected in the two protagonists. After all, a collage cannot be recast in the words of a closed poem without denying its paradoxical nature. In the English version, Ernst, by avoiding integration of word and image, pro- claimed above all the integrity of the collage. Since only minor differences appear in Robert Valen?ay's otherwise accurate French translations from the German, the two versions can be examined together. The absence of capital letters and punctuation emphasizes the spatial appearance of the texts. Several poems are divided into stanzas, others include refrains. Words generate each other by sounds parodying conventional patterns of versification: bodenloser los ("die obskuren") [bottomless fate ("the obscure ones")] viezucht und unzucht ("die obskuren") [neither animal nor disculture] singulierement le cor de la vie corne ("une vie de heros") [strangely life's horn blares ("A hero's life")] Ernst attracts the reader's attention to the auditive quality of his po- etry, not only phonetically but semantically: 590</page><page sequence="17">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT preter l'oreille a la cueillette ("equinoxe") [lend your ear to the fruitpicking ("equinox")] horch aufs apfelsinenpflucken ("tag und nachtgleich") [listen to the orangepicking ("day like night")] puis-je en croire mon tympan? [can I believe my eardrum?] tauscht mich das trommelfell? [does my eardrum deceive me?] In "les obscurs" carefully synchronized substitutions of bat and beaver interact with a group of words referring either auditively or seman- tically to "souris" (this is pertinent only to the French texts). un sourire dans l'arbre a feu ("puis-je en croire mon tympan?") [a smile in the fire-tree] la fable de la souris de milo [the fable of the mouse of Milo] toutes deux se tiennent coites souriceaux pollux en chauve-souris ("les obscurs") [they both keep still, little mice, Pollux disguised as bat] l'homme chauve-souris chevauche ("la nuit du jugement dernier") [the bat-man rides by night ("the night of the last judgment")] The recurrence of terms has a function quite similar to that of the snails in the collages and provides mysterious signals. Other poetic devices, such as personification and animation, are also introduced into Ernst's poetry: unermiidlich platschert der lebensweg durch festland und murmelt quatsch ("ein heldenleben") [indefatigably dabbles the way of life across the solid ground stammering nonsense ("a hero's life")] sans relache le chemin de la vie murmure a travers la terre ferme chemin bafouilleur ("une vie de heros") [without interruption life's way murmurs across the solid, stammering path] This poem does not allude to a recognizable celebrity, be it by name or by action. The hero is a passive model amidst change and flux, 591</page><page sequence="18">NEW LITERARY HISTORY which emanate from the course of life itself. Ernst, in introducing repeatedly comparisons or hypotheses by terms such as "comme" or "comme si" and, in German, "als waren," uses a poetic device to imply falsity, disguise, and to arouse the reader-viewer's mistrust. Cultural associations can create bonds, as though to extend the possibilities of language. Like the title Paramyths, "la souris de milo" can be considered a verbal collage, for the mouse and Milo have no true connection. Milo is known for the statue of Venus, which we freely associate, because of their domineering presence in the Louvre, with the smile ("souris") of the Mona Lisa. Ernst's newly coined verbal collage, which depends on displacement of a single word, assaults our threadbare cultural heritage. Ernst repeatedly informs his reader, especially his French reader, that he constructs his poems strictly according to logic and seemingly in keeping with his adherence to classical models: ainsi donc la raison fr6le son aride tunique ("puis-je en croire mon tympan?") [thus reason brushes its arid tunic] on peut en deduire leur insondable destin ("les obscurs") [from this we can deduct their fathomless destiny] or man kann mit sicherheit daraus schliessen ("die obskuren") [one can infer their unfathomable destiny] Logic, reason, or more appropriately, the Surrealist para-reason man- ifests itself on the surface by "ainsi donc," echoing a terminology pertinent to Descartes, Boileau, and mathematical reasoning. Also, the French text contains ramifications specific to that language (for instance, the polyvalence of "tympan"-eardrum and frieze-or the homonym "souris"-smile and mouse). If the French poems permit expansion of the text-image relation by means of verbal ambiguity, the German text more directly reflects the nature of the collage. Ernst untiringly juxtaposes or couples words without prior connections, using and misusing linguistic models: pestfahnen ("tauscht mich das trommelfeld?") [pest-flags ("does my eardrum deceive me?")] mythenschirm [myth-hat] 592</page><page sequence="19">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT fledermensch ("die jungste nacht") [batman ("the last night")] oberdrachentoter ("ein heldenleben") [the superior of the dragon killers ("a hero's life")] Urgrosswald, urgrossmutterschaft ("die jiingste nacht") [great-grandforest, great-grandmothership ("the last night")] "Fledermensch," for instance, is composed of two parts, instead of three as in French, "l'homme chauve-souris." The German conveys just as clearly the meaning and the surprise elements, but it also creates in the reader the awareness that scissors have been active, that something has been excised as a new object was created. Repetitious elements, as mentioned earlier, provide parodies of versifications, refrains, assonances attributable to the synthetic nature of the German language. "Ein heldenleben" includes recurring units. The repetition of un-"unerbittlich," "ungewohnlich," "unermiidlich"-is semantically relevant to heroic life, which is further reinforced by "lebensweg," "lebenshorn," "lebensbild." This terminology seems to frame, if irregularly, the poem and confirms its title. However, dis- turbances occur as terms, casual in tone and meaning, emerge be- tween the outlines of the frame: "unermiidlich platschert der leben- sweg / durchs festland und murmelt quatsch." Heroism becomes de- valuated as it loses its appropriate context, as the expected noble words and deeds give way to "quatsch." The recurrent prefix un ("unmensche," "unvogel," and "unzucht") also proclaims the impos- sibility and unsuitability of "our gods and heroes." Nonetheless, the collage shows an apparently reassuring family portrait of the hero, his wife, and his child. The male hero originates in anatomical plates; he even wears a medieval helmet, while his spouse descends once more from Olympus (fig. 7). In the text we find direct references to the "model" child and a statement that the hero "turned out well himself." As Ernst refers to "urgrossmutterschaft" and "urgros- swald," two words he coined in order to extend human heredity to the vegetable world and childbearing to old age, he has, by adding and shuffling prefixes around, subverted all possibilities of a heroic career. By his deft lexical as well as syntactical manipulations, Ernst shows that he has attained a mastery in his native tongue comparable to his achievement in graphic assemblage. A comparison between the final collage and the French and German texts shows even more clearly just how Ernst makes literary and graphic assemblage both complement one another and collide (fig. 8). Beside three nude women, forming a tight and tender group 593</page><page sequence="20">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Fig. 7 by their embrace, four naked heroes (or are they anatomical models?) join in battle. They display bulging, skinless muscles contrasting with the smooth skin of the three Graces. Above them hovers a hybrid creature combining human, animal, and vegetable traits, whose arms and wings resemble clothing. The warriors present another stage and a multiplication of the preceding warrior ("une vie de heros"), rec- ognizable by the same muscular representation and snail shapes. The hybrid creature, hovering above, presents in its pattern and shapes a modification of the bat and the beaver as well as of the Venus head i 594 I i" P, I</page><page sequence="21">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT Fig. 8 and the streetlight moth (Collage 2). In view of its spatial location, it also stands for a heavenly body, god, angel, moon, sun, or star. Max Ernst has concocted a collage consisting of incongruous jux- tapositions which simultaneously construct and deconstruct a make- believe world in search of a storyteller. The viewer sees beyond the warrior's skin, even into the snaillike convolutions of the brains. Ernst has not relied on a single anatomical chart but borrowed from a variety of plates muscles, bones, and perhaps nerves, all the while cutting, deforming, castrating. The numerous "fibers and threads" 595</page><page sequence="22">NEW LITERARY HISTORY of the human anatomy are interwoven, braided, or wound as though to expose and parody myths of structure, cohesion, and organicism. The poems are based on repetitive patterns of ready-made expres- sions such as "deci dela," "hin und her," "de temps en temps," "dann und wann": les jeunes filles dechainees se dandinent clopin-clopant [the wild girls sway with rolling gait] hin und her am langsamen ort schaukeln die ausgelassenen madchen [back and forth at the slow pace swing the unleashed girls] Allusions to male and female, time and space, repeated or rather rotated, never carry with them the same associations. Ernst suggests different movements, rhythms, intentions which logically annul one another while increasing their strength, as in the collage, by grinding against each other. Text and collage are held together by a title borrowed from the New Testament, "la nuit du jugement dernier" ("die jiingste nacht"). But what about the three Graces that derive from a Greek model? And if the origins of the protagonists hardly call for a Christian in- terpretation, perhaps the location will prove to be more helpful. The hovering, hybrid creature substitutes for Christ as represented in paintings of the Last Judgment and the Ascension. This dragon- shaped miniature may even turn out to be the devil, thus adding one more inversion to a long list. The world of muscles and bones intro- duces a nocturnal landscape. These "ecorches," even if they do not perform like martyrs, pertain to Christian mythology. In the poem, the recurrent expressions "hin und her," "deci dela," "bergauf bergab," "clopin-clopant," "nach rechts nach links," "a droite a gauche" suggest a casual routine hardly appropriate to the Last Judg- ment but helping to explain the protagonists' lack of concern. The poem ends in silence and eternity without direct mention of the final judgment. Yet allusions to steps of horses suggest that Ernst scatters echoes from the Apocalypse. Now the hybrid creature in the collage assumes an additional identity: if we fully assume the double role that Ernst has foisted upon us, we contribute to the paramythical repre- sentation of the beast of the Apocalypse. In 1964 appeared Maximiliana ou l'exercice illegal de l'astronomie: "Pour commenter et illustrer les donnees de Ernest Guillaume Tempel mises en lumiere par Iliazd."16 This joint homage by Max 596</page><page sequence="23">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT Ernst and Iliazd differs from the preceding examples on which we have commented, for the painter does not create or contribute to a literary text but responds to the trials, tribulations, and discoveries of a late nineteenth-century German astronomer who would not or could not conform to the scientific establishment of his day. Ernst limits his own endeavor to a commentary and an illustration of the astronomer's verbal "donnees," which provided the basis for both "gravures" and "ecritures." The painter mediates for an obscure as- tronomer whose "raw data" he expands and transforms into an illus- trated book. From Tempel's words and charts will be wrought the livre de peintre's indissociable texts and images. As the name Maxi- miliana, bequeathed by its discoverer, was quickly replaced by its of- ficial name Cybele, Tempel fell into an almost brutal oblivion. In 1878 he had himself compared "la perte de la memoire" ("the loss of memory") to "la perte de l'art de voir" ("the loss of the art of seeing").17 Ernst's and Iliazd's contributions, termed "illustrer" and "mises en lumi/re," are destined to end the eclipse, both physical and spiritual, of an astronomer and a planet by the creation of the book. Ernst and Tempel are intricately linked. Peter Schamoni includes in his Maximiliana a photomontage composed of two portraits rep- resenting Ernst surrounding one of Tempel, both men wearing the same clothes, thus suggesting that one was the other's alter ego.18 Maximiliana begins with "Max," Tempel's first name is Ernest. In- deed, the painter makes use of word games in Maximiliana as he had in illustrating Paramyths. Nothing appears more basic in a linguistic game than the act of naming. Tempel himself was preoccupied with a system of designation. Thus the substitution of Cybele for his own Maximiliana stripped him of his identity and reduced the significance of his name. Ernst had already introduced Maximiliana into the skies and vision as early as 1931 in a collage.19 His fascination with the planet and the astronomer goes beyond the coincidence created by the identity of names. The fact that Tempel practiced astronomy illegally and entered into conflict with the authorities appealed to the author of Une Semaine de bonte.20 From Ernst's perspective, Tempel, misunderstood and threatened, becomes the revolutionary artist will- fully deprived of appropriate channels of communication: "L'art de voir est en train de se perdre par suite de l'invention de toutes sortes d'instruments optiques" ["The art of seeing is becoming lost because of the invention of all sorts of optical instruments"] (1878); "Je crois qu'un peintre paysagiste se rangerait a mon opinion" ["I believe that a landscape painter would be on my side"] (1882).21 Tempel implicitly advocates artistic as opposed to technological tendencies in his search for vision, particularly inner vision. In this respect Ernst would naturally recognize in him an ally who, 597</page><page sequence="24">NEW LITERARY HISTORY some eighty years earlier, had faced the same problems. Indeed, the painter had on numerous occasions sought new ways to represent domains inaccessible to normal perception. He had painted, etched, or drawn the sky, its constellations, their myths and mystery. In many of his paintings and engravings, Ernst, far from revealing the infinite distance to stars and planets, gives the impression of bringing the sky within close proximity to the viewer.22 By dividing his paintings hor- izontally into two parallel sections, by reducing the landscape to its essentials, by making land and water interchangeable and the sky polyvalent, Ernst abolishes the spatial dimension linked to perspec- tive. The reader does not immediately encounter Tempel's data as transmitted by Iliazd and translated by Ernst. From the vellum cover through layers of empty sheets of paper, varying in texture, grain, and shade, he journeys through space before he even sees writing and etching. Text and design present ever-changing rearrangements, never repeated patterns in which verticality gradually prevails over horizontality. Ernst and Iliazd have studiously avoided the usual black lines of ordinary letterpress on white paper, for they have trans- formed each page. Iliazd rearranged fragments of Tempel's official statements and his letters into a confession both personal and scien- tific which includes passages in French, German, and Italian. Pages of poetry, of sensitive observations, of declarations on human exis- tence alternate. These various types of discourse are printed in always renewed spatial arrangements and typographical characters. Most pages are broken up into several juxtaposed sections, typography and etching, typography and collage, or two differing kinds of typog- raphy, including printed characters, mysterious figures, and "hand- drawn" letters. The pages propose graphic images even if they are primarily composed of a printed text. One of the simplest designs consists of a few words scattered on the page (fig. 9). Each word, read in a diagonal, zigzagging but clearly descending movement without ever forming a straight or repetitive line, suggests a constellation where individual letters mirror the pas- sage of shooting stars. The meaning of the text, always concerned with distance, clearly relates to the etching. The eye moves across the picture of Maximiliana in a pigmented sky, perhaps the Milky Way. Ernst's visual sky views, which include heavenly bodies bearing sim- ilarities with spirals and clockworks, combine the natural with the mechanical, the mechanical with the invisible (fig. 10). The clockwork wheel and the unwinding spiral situate Maximiliana in a paradoxical time span. Immobility and rotation are suggested simultaneously. As on the very title page appear the dark outlines, enlarged in dimmer 598</page><page sequence="25">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT Fig. 9 shades, of an anthropomorphic figure, the paradox of double vision is introduced at the very beginning. A mysterious writing covers various pages in conjunction with or- dinary typography, collage, or etching. The invented characters and the conventional typography confront each other on most pages. Werner Spies calls the ciphers "Geheimschrift": "Max Ernst entwick- elte fur dieses Buch eine Geheimschrift, die keinen einzigen erkenn- baren buchstaben enthielt und ebenso zu lesen war wie die Zeichen des Sternehimmels. ... Diese Schriftblocke dienen nicht nur als for- males Material, Max Ernst confrontiert in diesem Buch die Milch- strassen mit den zahllosen unlesbaren Schriftzeichen iibersaten Bot- schaften." ["Max Ernst developed for this book a secret writing, which did not include a single recognizable character and which was to be 599</page><page sequence="26">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Fig. 10 read like the signs of the sky.. . . These blocks do not only serve as the formal material, Max Ernst confronts in this book the Milky Way with the scattered messages of innumerable signs."]23 Max Ernst has invented an "alphabet" which is infinitely expandable as well as adapt- able to varying spatial conditions. His system imposes no limits as to the sign that can be made available. The secret writing bridges the gap between a familiar and an unfamiliar world, between the visible and the invisible, composed as it is of ciphers which simultaneously belong to visual and verbal codes. The writing, which functions throughout as a visual sign, creates only momentary illusion that it is decipherable, that the letters or shapes may somehow yield a meaning. On densely covered pages this visible language seems to withhold with even greater stubbornness its message. The secret language by no means assumes a single format, a single 600</page><page sequence="27">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT consistency. At times it forms a solid wall whose impenetrability we strive to challenge. At others it is reduced to marginal strips of varying sizes where verticality tends to dominate, as though to with- draw part of its visibility from the reader. Each of its signs suggests a vitality or dynamic shape, capable of expansion and above all of metamorphosis, defying the very notion of finality. Repeatedly, the secret wall multiplies circular or hectagonal shapes, pieces broken loose or made autonomous. Larger figures, resembling, momentarily at least, birds and other creatures, promise to become shapes in a continuous process. On sparsely covered pages, the signs tend to show greater fluidity and more closely approximate ideograms. On several pages the secret writing produces a frame surrounding a central sec- tion neatly delineated and teeming with drawings of figures, varia- tions of writings. This simultaneous projection on each page of close and distant visions reflects Tempel's attempt to make stars visible by magnifying them. Because the secret writing can provide both the center and the frame of the page as spatial entities, it not only bridges the gap between verbal and graphic but becomes ecriture in the strong sense. Void and plenitude, presence and absence, legibility and ille- gibility are no longer contradictions. These figures in the center, by evoking the viewer surrounded by the view, create, as it were, a se- miotic portrait of Tempel, stressing his upward-turned glance, his aspirations. Such processes disturb customary reading habits. As alternatively we read, decode, decipher, we deviate from the accustomed manner of reading, abandon all parallelism and change our course. We read as we journey through space. Within the space of the page appear not only variations and expansions of the mysterious code, but draw- ings and etchings. Repeatedly, pronounced rectangular and spiral shapes, even "diagrams," emerge in the etchings. These reduced and stylized forms speak of the swiftness characteristic of celestial move- ments and inscribe the evanescent traces of planets. These "in-text" etchings introduce still another perspective of the skyscape. In rela- tion to both the secret writing and the larger, almost full-sized plates, they present different degrees of immediacy, different forms of re- duction, different ways of conveying the distant world. They provide references to Tempel's observations, to his theories, which Ernst transmits, all the while establishing interchange and even reversibility between comment and illustration. The book, a prophecy, composed of collected data, embraces a wide range of "written" or "scribal" artforms which invite the viewer to create other combinations and constellations. In the lithographs, subdued blue- and red-shaded clouds emerge. Solar and stellar bodies combine recognizable signs from maps and 601</page><page sequence="28">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Fig. 11 otherworldy vision. Amid these dispersions and condensations the planet "unfolds" like a cell, spelling out the promise of the future, of new birth. These maps visualizing Tempel's sayings, sometimes in- spired by the astronomer's own lithographs, offer surprising varia- tions on Ernst's own work. The painter also repeatedly includes fig- ures representing a distorted, overgrown net or grid where merge organic and geometrical forms. A black-colored tree pressing against a leaf-colored net creates a new set of signs. The gigantic flower, a reduction of the sun with its multiple lines and loops, resembles non- linear handwriting. As we mentioned earlier, the legible text of Maximiliana varies con- siderably, not only by its spatial arrangement and typography, but also textually. In addition to an account of Tempel's discovery and 602</page><page sequence="29">MAX ERNST: VISUAL AND VERBAL DISPLACEMENT subsequent persecution, Iliazd includes a poem providing a contin- uous narration spread over four pages. It confronts and crowns the mysterious writing arranged in variously shaped blocks as well as more or less recognizably outlined figures suggesting mobility and fluctuation. The secret writing, with its emancipated, autonomous figures, functions as an illustration for the regularly printed text, which is suspended in the upper regions of the page and which "sings" the epic existence of Tempel: Mochte wieder Glockner werden, auf die Hohe wollt ich gehn Wo ich unter mir die Erden voll der Menschen konnte sehn Ja ein Glockner m6cht ich werden, Glockenton sei mein Gesang [I would like to become a bell ringer again, would like to attain heights where I can see below me the earth full of people I would like to become a bell ringer, my song will be the sound of the bells.] "Ce ne sont pas les grandes lunettes qui font les grands astronomes" ["Great telescopes do not great astronomers make"]: this proverb refers to Tempel's fundamental opposition to mechanization and as- sertion of inner vision. We hear at the end of the book that the astronomer's method will not stand the test of time, for those who follow Tempel will make their discoveries by instruments without benefit of poetic vision (fig. 11). Thus the proverb becomes paradox- ical. Strangely enough, Ernst seems to parody his own notorious text: "Ce n'est pas la colle qui fait le collage." ["It is not paste that makes the collage."]24 On the two pages which include the above statements, the painter introduces "cutout" sections, collages alluding to his ear- lier works. These borrowed images are by no means mere repetitions, for they are swiftly transformed under the viewer's eyes: a shell into a skirt, a medal into a star, a bodice into a book. By adding zigzag lines to a plain seashell, he evokes a dancing figure-the rim of the shell becomes the pleats of the skirt, suggesting the impact of move- ment undercutting the solid, material aspects of the shell, so that hypothetically it can be projected into space. As we leaf through the book, we also notice repeatedly that letters, as soon as they are en- larged, tend to free themselves from the two-dimensional surface of the page and emerge as figures. We have maintained that on most pages, we are drawn into the "orbit" of writing as a visual and plastic entity. The orbit as a space, 603</page><page sequence="30">NEW LITERARY HISTORY as a traceless path described by a body, refers to both visibility and invisibility. The ambiguous role of "Ce ne sont pas les grandes lu- nettes qui font les grands astronomes" stresses once again the im- portance of semantics, which will soon be challenged on pages where the encroachment of the purely visual manifests itself strongly. The representation of a distant stellar landscape is juxtaposed with the sentence "Telescope a vendre." In L'Art de voir we find that statement, supposedly made by Tempel for purely economic reasons, but its ideological overtones are rampant. The accompanying vision of the landscape is "far," not "close," "distinct," not "blurred"; thus the verbal statement multiplies meanings and levels of interrelationships. Ernst's contribution to the book never parallels in a simplistic manner Tempel's sayings or Iliazd's arrangements. Tensions, remarkable changes in distance, occur throughout. Three men-scientist, editor, and painter-were involved in the creation and fabrication of the book. The editor contributes to the visibility of Maximiliana by writing a preface, a eulogy of Tempel, the scientist alienated from his times, who opposed the commonly accepted ideas of progress. Tempel himself becomes an artist whose observations led to vision, who drew maps and made lithographs. Ernst, the creator of many a "machine celibataire," has emulated and parodied, graphically and poetically, certain scientific pursuits. By his ecriture and eau-forte he became the accomplice of Tempel, whose ventures, in collaboration with Iliazd, he made visible and therefore known. Maximiliana constitutes a manifesto, engaging the reader- viewer in Ernst's and Tempel's fight against the loss of inner vision. The painter strove to make visible the full range of language as visual and conceptual entities. When images reflect each other, when words illustrate representations which are mirrored in both text and image, the illustrated book abolishes the distinction between verbal and vi- sual. An undeniable verbal trace informs Ernst's artistic production throughout his career, thus leading to a paradox. Compared to Dali or Magritte, he can hardly be considered a literary painter. The verbal and the graphic elements displace each other, without either of them preempting the territory conventionally belonging to the other. The verbal and the visual function as active agents of reciprocal subversion.
