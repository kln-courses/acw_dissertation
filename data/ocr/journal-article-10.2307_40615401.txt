<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Poems Of Derek Walcott VARIOUS critics of West Indian poetry have declared it unoriginal. They suggest naively that the West Indian poet, having no tradition oí his own, is simply content to produce 'jackdaw collections' from a long line of English poets. To such critics Derek Walcott must indeed be a frustrating figure. For what his work clearly reveals is that a poet's merit lies, not in creating a medium denoted by a cliquish label, but in his power to grasp the elements of his own experience, and to show, by placing them within a universal tradition, that they are a meaningful part of the world's experience. In Walcott's poetry as well as his plays, West Indian reality painfully conflicts with that of the outside world, emphasizing each man's moral obligation to life Itself. Such work draws selectively on important historical lines, yet has its own originality, shaped by the poet's native experience, and made more striking by its universally significant context. The Prelude at the beginning of In A Green Night provides a suitable basis for discussing the various aspects of Walcott's poetry. In it he admirably suggests the isolation of his island home from the rest of the world, the stagnant nature of the life there into which one is drawn, and finally the awakened sense of purpose, and the revela- tion gained in the attempt to pierce life's veil. The first three lines are excellent, giving in atmosphere and tone the essence of the poem. I, with legs crossed along the daylight, watch The variegated fists of clouds that gather over The uncouth features of this, my prone island. The poet sits "with legs crossed along the daylight," and the unusual metaphor suggests purposeless relaxation in an oblivion warmed by sunlight. The clouds are given "variegated fists," an apt description of the way clouds bunch; and the personification of "uncouth features" and "prone" not only economically conveys the rugged aspect of the land in "uncouth," but also completes in "prone" the idea of a bullying Nature which, battering the island's features into uncouthness, has floored and has it at its mercy. Movement and compactness of expression are excellent, and the language serves very well the dual purpose of vivid natural description and helpless isolation. The island is lost, a mere tourist attraction, as proved by the steamers which "divide horizons," and in the "blue reflection of eyes," "behind ardent binoculars," that "have known cities and think us here happy." Again, the ideas are conveyed with an efficacy which indicates perfectly the isolation by filling in the visual scene begun with the first three lines. To bunched clouds over the rugged features of an island sprawled in the sun is added the sight of steamers crossing between dimly perceived horizons with tourists on deck, so intent on watching that the binoculars 3 3</page><page sequence="2">glued to their eyes seem to have generated an ardour of their own. The "blue" reflection of eyes suggests also the blue of the sky in between the white clouds. In this stagnant existence, as is implicit in his tone of voice, Walcott is not content, simply patient; but "time creeps over the patient who are too long patient," and so his choice made, he dis- covers that his boyhood has already "gone over." The very movement of the lines with the vividly suggestive word "creeps" makes us think of Time in physical terms crawling cyclically over him, and carrying in a material sense each phase of age, - that of boyhood having already "gone over". The next section hints ironically at what are the later stages of life in the island. The "profound" cigarette, "the turned doorhandle", "the knife turning in the bowels of the hours". These lines abound in suggestion, as does the greater part of Walcott's poetry. They conjure up to me an age of retiring ease with profound drags on cigarettes which are a mere pose to hide the mental stagna- tion beneath the surface, and which gyrates continually around the act of sex, - if we place emphasis on "turned doorhandle" and "knife turning in the bowels" which convey in their movement the appropriate motion. Indeed, there is so much association hidden in the lines that it is easy to see them as evoking sex images. "Profound" suggests depth, hence subconscious depth, the idea of "turned doorhandle" that of entry through, from a door of consciousness to one of subconscious- ness, and at this level, the "knife" becomes a Freudian male sex symbol turning deep in the bowels. On another level the knife is a symbol of the murderous, self-destructive abuse of unbridled sensual living. A stagnant existence, summed up, as in the Eliot phrase, - "birth, copulation and death." At his stage of development within this life, the poet goes through all the acts peculiar to it. I go of course through all the isolated acts, Make a holiday of situations, Straighten my tie and fix important jaws, And note the living images Of flesh that saunter through the eye. Such felicitous expression with a definite visual image at its core recalls clearly the perpetual holiday conditions prevailing in the experience. It is quite typical of the smaller islands in the Eastern Caribbean, the procession of acts which have no inherently important meaning, and the tendency to approach every work situation in a casual, holiday spirit. The third line is excellent. The picture leaps clear to the mind, of the poet standing before "a mirror straightening his tie and fixing important jaws," and we get the idea of an endless daily ritual of tie- straightening in which an empty self-importance is acted out in "fixing important jaws." Finally in the middle of the journey through life, O how I came upon you, my Reluctant leopard of the slow eyes. These are two oí the most powerful lines in the Prelude. The leopard image brings to mind an old saying, - "Can the leopard change his spots? - Character persists," and in the present context implies that 3 4</page><page sequence="3">what you truly are will eventually emerge, once the quest for self- development is launched. This, at last, is what has happened for the poet, and the last line with its image of a leopard rolling its eyes slowly in that calm calculating way which suggests a tremendous strength and agility ready to be unleashed, very effectively connotes to the strength and calm produced by inner development and under- standing. The process of development we shall not of course be acquainted with till we have examined his lesson of suffering in "accurate iambics," but this introductory poem places us at the beginning of the journey, accompanied by the relevant passengers with whom we must travel in examination, - Walcott, his island, a breeding ground of stagnant apathy, and the outside world from which the West Indies seem significantly isolated. The poem, The Harbour seems to strike initially the keynote of intention and aspiration. The picture created is of fishermen rowing home in the silent dusk. They do not question the stilness through which they move, he says, so on the eve of a new sunrise he should no.t dwell either on the calm shelter which the harbour has provided, since its emotional associations are powerful and feeling drowns the intellect. And so there shall be "no secret faring forth" of what is within; Time alone knows that "bitter and sly sea, and love raises walls." Ostensibly then, we are given the idea of a physical journey, the real implication behind which is the poet's outward journey on the sea of life. Two preceding lines with their powerful visual impulse establish a link with "love raises walls." The night urger of old lies Winked at by stars that sentry the humped hills. . . A vivid picture of night with its stars and hunched hills, made vivid by the activity of the verb "winked" and the sense of these active stars appearing to be guards of the "humped" hills, is induced by simply including the phrase, "urger of old lies," to suggest other nights in similar settings and on which some woman inspired by the atmosphere has perhaps uttered romantic untruths. Love and the perception which it gives into motive thus raises the walls of internal conflict. But as one writer says, "ambition is the only power which combats love," and so this sea, the ocean flow of life on which he is now travelling, takes priority; it is a more cruel one than any dilemma of love, - one capable of shipwrecking the individual. The unthinking, those content with simply existing, may "climb safe to liners," to cling in blind acceptance to the world's enigma; with calm determination he will venture forth on his own, a seafarer in his small craft on the waters of destiny, though he may never reach, though they may hear rumours of his shipwreck incurred by the boundless nature of his aspirations. The language of this poem has a compactness and pre- cision here reminiscent of the seventeenth century, - and one thinks of Donne and Marvell, but the tone is very suggestive of Tennyson's 'Ulysses9 and helps to create by association the mood of discovery and exploration which Walcott would convey. The total meaning is in this way greatly enriched. Walcott may have learnt the principle from 3 5</page><page sequence="4">Eliot whose influence in this direction seems to have been considerable, extending even as far as the Italian poet, Eugenio Montale. This desire to pierce life's meaning has been stimulated by the harsh impact of reality, forcing its shock in on the inner self, a reality aggravated by conditions in the external environment, of poverty, isolation and ignorance on various levels. Its impact on the inner life is dealt with in Orient and Immortal Wheat, as shown to the experience of a little boy of thirteen tormented by fever and made to feel the monstrous, oppressive atmosphere of Nature in his affliction. To grasp the full meaning of the poem it must be read in the context of the author, Traherne, quoted initially. Traherne was a mystic of the seventeenth century who believed in the spiritual vision of child- hood. Heaven for him was there eternally in the present on earth, completely discernible in the innocent child's vision, but also visible to the adult, if only he would use his eyes to the purpose for which God gave him them. Our blessedness to see Is even to the Deity A beatific vision! He attains His ends while we enjoy. He in us reigns. Walcott, on the other hand, shows how the belief in the original sin of Adam with its acceptance of sickness and misery as the inevitable lot of man plunges innocent youth, "absolved in limacól and evening prayer," into misery and confused oppression, and cancels all possibility of vision. This for the poet is what really gives birth to sin, the sin of ignorance in which the ritual of superstitiously directed prayer impresses on the receptive mind of a fever-stricken small boy the heritage of "original sin," and makes his bright world a suddenly horrid place. The point is emphasized by the dazzling visions of sun-struck galvanize seen through the youngster's window. This, the poet says ironically, in answer to Traherne, is the heaven revealed to young eyes. So many subtle allusions unite in the poem that the total meaning is greatly strengthened. The youngster "sweats inherent sin"; then in the excellent portrait drawn, we see him in feverish detachment, "dusk / - / - - / - rougeing his peaked face," studying "the swallows stitch the opposing eaves/in repetitions of the fall from grace." First, the imagery brings a clear picture, - we see the flushed pink face made more so by the reflection of red sunset in dusk; then the movement of the next line which is run-on, with trochaic and frequent pyrrhic modulation on the base, vividly suggests the sudden and continued downward flitting of the birds. This image is made to point to the "fall from grace" and we immediately think of Milton's Paradise Lost and the Fall of Man. The language is really effective and succeeds in showing how the physical surroundings of the boy take on to him an appearance coincident with his own flushed physical condition. So he weeps, as a youngster in such misery would weep, without quite knowing why, at "dazzling visions of reflected tin." The circumstance is reminiscent of 6</page><page sequence="5">Wordsworth in The Prelude where the sudden monstrous shape of a crag round a curve in the bay filled his heart with dread. In this way for the boy, Heaven is revealed to fevered eyes, So is sin born, and innocence made wise, In intimations of hot galvanize. Allusions here to Traherne and to Wordsworth coincide, - to the former in the first line, and to the latter in "intimations" of the last line. All these parallels emphasize the contrast which Walcott is making. The conclusive point made is that the endowing of Ood with human characteristics throws the very shadows of hell on living instead of leading to heaven, and lays ironically a charge against Christ who Himself had such great pity for cripples and for little children. Once more allusion is effective, recalling the gospel synopses of the New Testament, while the little boy becomes identified with this past through "the lamplighter" as represented by his parent. The final picture is of a youngster weak and helpless, listening to the dread footfalls on the stair which might well be those of Chaos in the onset of blackest night, rather than of his Maman approaching with his soup. In Choc Bay we get, on a more personally handled scale, the painful knowledge and disillusionment which can later follow experiences like that recounted in Orient and Immortal Wheat. In a daybreak scene which is quite West Indian with the sound of the fisherman's conch shell announcing the catch, Walcott brings every- thing to life with living description. The sea wakes with birds; the hawk, a speck on the horizon, is brought strikingly to action as it climbs over the town then falls upon the sea. As it climbs, the town appears, very realistically, to fall away, giving the impression of shuddering yet swift flight upwards. The line itself starts with airy pyrrhic stress, changes to the disturbing trochee which establishes a sense of the vastness of the heavens still towering while the bird rises, but towering less so as the movement switches to regular iambic to suggest regular upward flight. As the hawk falls, the predominance of heavy spondaic and trochaic stress creates a clear image of nerveless descent. - - / - / / - / In the heaven's eye climbs the hawk Over the falling town, / / / - / Then down, dropping down Over the water The fish move and sparkle with the use of such descriptive terms as "driven," "bright," and the picture of the fishermen throwing the sein leaps to the imagination with the exquisite "row by rote to spread their webbed wishes." In the third section the note changes to one of grief in the prey of creature on creature, the mute mullet, black porpoises, spearfishing birds, pelicans, heron-necks, and we can hear the 7</page><page sequence="6">incoherent noise of gulls in a powerfully onomatopoeic line which appropriately reminds one of the Expressionist Wilfred Owen and his staccato lines in Anthem for Doomed Youth. Gulls building babble over the wrecks. The sudden intrusion of a diver from the bluff into the water intro- duces "Mary, the sea-lost," and "Venus, the sea-born." From there we go on to what seems to be the heart of the poem symbolically and through allusion. Both Mary and Venus are deaf to the rout of waves representing the internal turmoil of the individual on his sea of life, and to the wailing horn representative in the fishermen of his people's cry. Venus it must be remembered was the goddess of Love and Beauty, but was also associated with Ares or Mars, the god of War, for whom she forsook at one time her ugly husband Hephaestus. In this way Walcott's mention of her arouses associations of war and conflict, while the diver at the beginning becomes representative of the human agency behind this. The transition to the next few lines thus comes naturally: And I, with a black Heart, and my back Healing from history. . . Here is what accounts for some considerable part of the poet's inner conflict and turmoil, - the slave-scourge of history applied to the black man's, his brother's back. It fuses with his other harsh experiences, and forces him to challenge life's values, the religious not excluded. "Black heart" is particularly effective; it seems so incon- gruous and far-fetched, and thus exposes the fact that whether men's skin be black or white, their hearts are all the same colour. The "Blackhanded, hate-bridled fishermen" have no myth like Venus to support them, only that of a prayer, of belief in the Virgin, for Venus lives with the aristocrat, the man who uses his power to suppress the underdog on the self-assumed basis of superiority, and who to remain aristocratic must continually exert violence. Yet it is not for the beauty of the conch-blown day so vividly and purposely introduced earlier that the poet's mind "rides anchor there"; not for the "shell of the wailing dawn," - and the juxtaposing of 'shell' and 'wailing' brings back the idea of conflict and war, - nor is it for stricken love; but it is for the "rare Width of blue air, For the hawk's heel straying Over blue fields, I still am praying, For the wheeling spokes Of gulls from the crusted wreck, I kneel to the shell's mass - And at the bells of leaves I pay respect. There is an almost mystical note struck in these lines. "The rare width of blue air" reminds one that the element air is taken as a symbol of released consciousness, as for example, in Burnt Norton of the 3 8</page><page sequence="7">Four Quarters where Eliot deals with a moment of expanded con- sciousness. It appears to be the sort of moment which Walcott is seek- ing here, a moment as free as the hawk soaring on light wings over blue fields, a moment which can arise through finding a still point in the centre of the wheel of consciousness suggested by the gulls moving in wheeled spokes from the crusted wreck, just as he himself would for that moment fly in quest of wisdom and insight far from the wreck which man has made of humanity. And so in the church of Nature's surroundings he kneels "at the shell's mass," paying respect to the bells of leaves around him. His mind flies as high as the birds, but the note of expectancy soon changes to one of sad disappointment as heralded in "the salt washing his heel," - salt suggesting the .salt of tears and the bogged aspect of his heel contrasting with the hawk's heel high and free in the air to suggest that he never gets off the ground himself; in the "grey sea's tears," and in the blue and green colours of Mary's gown which forgive his boyhood that it should have grown out of "a wise hoax," by symbolically offering something deeper and higher as yet unattained. Thus, hero temporarily, "hallooed by the Caves" and "haloed by the Sun," for him there comes the return to sober reality. 0 Time what if I gave the wrong things praise, The wildest sorrows about. This is the revaluation of the man who has shed his boyhood; and in grief for which he has words enough for utterance and tears enough for shedding, he wheels, trapped like the holy birds, in a dark circle whose still centre has not been found, and makes a final barefooted flight from what to him as boy would have been paradise. The poem Steerman, My Brother records yet another cause of Walcott's inner questioning and search for true value. It is written in memory of a friend's death, and throughout we can feel his faith bending to breaking point under the weight of emotion and thought produced by the death of this friend, Julian John, who was himself a firm believer in Christ. In the first section the idea is suggested, through "several rooted visionaries," that even if "flesh is mortal," "love is infinite," and that though the proud endeavours of "ribbed" man may sink in "dirt or swirling sea," his soul "forever yearns for the shores of light." Such simple sermons, however, since the shock of his friend's death in a strange land, have become meaningless. On that note the poem moves on from there to examine the grounds of faith. But it is not for John's bones that Walcott writes the elegy, nor for his spirit which his friend believed was yielded up to Christ, but for people like himself left behind, "twilight intellects on the edge of light," people who are always seeking, always on the verge, but never entering into full discovery. . . . where a wailing autumn strips the year And drives the rootless, ageing leaves for miles, 1 weep for hearts like mine, continually driven As these lost leaves across earth's barren ground. 3 9</page><page sequence="8">The picture of "rootless, ageing leaves being driven for miles" is a very sympathetic and evocative expression of the restless unsatisfied plight of people like him, who are themselves "lost leaves driven" on a barren soil. He wishes to believe that the path which his friend took will indeed be trod by Christ's "pierced halcyon feet." That classical description of Christ's feet with its reference to Halcyon and Ceyx excellently portrays the lightness of the feet that walked the waves, as well as their ability to calm the sea's rage. Walcott wishes to believe that all will move in exultation to God's shore; but at the moment he can only perceive one truth, that life is a mere endless sphere of motion, of change, of decay and ebb, its only halcyon days those of the forever changing seasons. Where in all this ash of energy, he asks, is his friend's, the lost helmsman's soul, - and where in this vast waste can man's home be found? It is grief, however, which forces us, as it has forced him, to search urgently in apparently mapless lives, for some sort of pattern and control, - which induces in us the need to simplify and forgive. Then do we turn for guidance to minds set ablaze by powerful heat which burns the trash of thought, leaving behind pure, inextinguishable elements with which in the clamour and restless noise of change they are able to weld lives of unshakeable calm and. peace. His friend, he says, would have been one of them. There is thus a contrast established between his friend and himself. Yet he once had such faith himself, but the waves of bitterness rolled over him and his cargo of faith shipwrecked. Faith seemed to perish utterly with the death of his friend, for the event brought much closer to him the harshness of life, - and dispelled his earlier trust in eventual safe harbours which vision, blinded by Time's dust, could not yet see. Questions follow in rapid succession. Why we are here on earth, defies human thought. Why is it that God is a God of war and death and equally of a beautiful Nature as epitomized in the exquisite- ly wrought jewelry of a raindrop? How can the very Maker who stimulates us to immortal unsatisfied questionings in face of life's facts produce nevertheless a "simple truth like love"? The poet is here in the very narrow straits between the "rocks of heaven and this world." He appeals for the restoration of his faith even in the lesson of a dear one's death, for the enigma of life wearies his struggling soul as his "reason seeks a mastery of argument with God." Yet at the end the note changes to one of quiet, but defiant hope. Usurp that monarchy, O temporal death, Fallen, fallen, greater than my friend Have fallen. . . It does not matter if death, possessed of only temporal power, usurps life's monarchy. The implication appears to be that greater than the steersman have fallen, namely Christ whose death has a redeeming significance. All Death's hosts of reason who would convince one of its invincibility therefore disperse like "stars drifting across the sands and bitter pastures" bordering on his sea of life. And so, hands arked in a gesture of prayer he wishes that the Holy Spirit may enter his heart. The armoured hosts of all those who reason for Death's finality merely revolt against themselves, for they are already fallen and await 10</page><page sequence="9">the final harvest, their pages at the world's end flung away, and their thoughts destructively warring with each other as they descend in night. Vain energies, with life so long to spend, When simple plants turn to light. Although the poem ends on this note, we get the feeling that in the continual recurrence of question and doubt shadows still lurk in the poet's mind, but he has certainly purged himself of some bitterness and stimulated his faith. Its sincerity and aim derive increased impact from a classical precision and form within which the argument steadily progresses, and from its tone and situation which seem deliberately reminiscent of a great elegy in English literature, Milton's Lyddas. This latter aspect comes home sharply where Walcott claims the real purpose of his elegy not to be on behalf of his friend who departed in the arms of faith, but for people like him, "twilight intellects on the edge of light." It reminds us of Milton, at the centre of whose elegy was the dread and apprehension that he could suffer the same fate of death as Edward King, before he accomplished his great purpose. There is in both the same turning to a creed of faith, to Christ's power, and in Walcott's poem the note, "Usurp that monarchy," heralding the change in tone recalls the "Return Alphaeus" of Milton, which ushered in the triumphal conclusion of his elegy. There are other points of allusion, too, as in the Walcott line, "That He whose pierced feet stilled the whistling seas," which faintly calls to mind another line in Lyddas,- "Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves." But the grounds for questioning in Walcott's poem are different, the context that of our own age; while the exploration, conducted in a greater spirit of community, derives power and force from being placed within a significant classical tradition. In Return to D'Ennery contemplation of the poverty in his environment leads to further conflict, but reveals a growth in maturity. Caught in the rain, Walcott surveys the squalour of the village. The opening line has a visual image which reproduces the scene of falling rain effectively. Imprisoned in these wires of rain, I watch This village stricken with a single street. The rain is falling in clearly discernible lines of torrent which look like wires strung between heaven and earth. The use of the adjective "stricken" to describe the village sets the tone of what is to come; the presence of the street is an affliction in its own poverty-stricken aspect. And the remaining description follows in admirable support. Each shack worn by the weather is a complacent cripple leaning for support on its crutch of wooden foundation. Five years ago, in a less recrudescent stage of his life, even poverty had seemed sweet in the "azure indifference of the air" and the "murmurous oblivion of the sea." The place had "seemed born for being buried" there, and his own feelings merged with the general native acceptance of fate. &lt;••</page><page sequence="10">So personal grief melts in the general wish. The whole scene is painted with artistic perception. Hospital quiet in the rain, naked boy driving his pigs into the bush; "the coast shudders with every surge," and its vibration comes to life in the evocative "shudders" and "surge"; a heron appears on the scene to add another specific detail to our imaginative picturing, and all around, - filth and / - foam. A sail moves realistically, as in the poet's description it "plunges and lifts", - trochee followed by iamb to give the downward plunge and upward movement; hills smoke with fog in the thin light, "the rain seeps slowly to the core of grief." But the purpose of all this description is not to burst into a bitter tirade at life's inequality. "The place could not change its sorrows and be home." It is Walcott's way of accepting the fact that it won't change, though compassion within him becomes more outward going and demonstrative. He has reached that point of maturity where he can detach his bitterness from these very wounds which have led to pained inquiry. Where is that passionate hatred that would help The black, the despairing, the poor, by speech alone? The fury shakes like wet leaves in the wind, The rain beats on a brain hardened to stone. There comes a time when man arrives at the limit of suffering, - its anchor, - a grave or a bed, and in despair seeks from God the know- ledge of his home, his place of rest. And thus the poet's grasping of reality through personal experience ascends in steps to contemplation of and sympathy with his environment and the people in it, and finally to the larger environment of the world and all its people who thus become fellow-sufferers. for no one will save The world from itself, though he walk among men. Yet the core of his concern is with his people. The passionate ones abroad believe, as Julian did, in the ultimate salvation of things, but for him his heart is too sorrowful, it is crucified in the midst of its devotion by the general horror of life. All else seems "romantic nonsense," which "ends at the bowsprit, shearing but never arriving beyond the reef -shore foam";- once more we get the picture of the individual on the sea-journey of life, seeking the shore, but never reaching. The picture is vivid: that of a boat shearing cutting into shore, but never passing the reef-shore's foam to arrive in harbour, and with a subsidiary scene within this larger one, of those who believe what is to Walcott romantic nonsense running along the spar protruding from the bow, but still unable by this extension to reach the shore. Yet he is sufficiently perceptive and unembittered to see that his failure to grasp faith fully is no proof that it is defunct. In this res- pect his people, in some ways worse off than he is, have a valuable lesson to teach him. For them, despite all life's afflictions, "Heaven remains where it is, in their hearts, in the very womb of their church, 12</page><page sequence="11">though the rain of obscurity may blur the shape of its outer lineaments." In a very honest and severe self-criticism, he sees himself to be less than they are, for his general passion of feeling springs from personal need, from individual desire to quiet the aching pangs within his own soul. And so in his judgment, he is "the most accursed of God's self- pitying creatures." This is harsh criticism, perhaps too harsh, but there is a valuable lesson in the parallel drawn for contrast between the villagers and himself. Their faith is simple, they are the "simple plants turning to light"; and perhaps what they have to teach is that happy absorbtion in the business of living which makes it possible to bear life's harsher moments. Just as "the white rain draws its net along the coast" wiping out the weather's frowns in departure, so are they able with laughter to wipe out the frowns of sorrow. Not so Walcott; the rain has left yet still seeps in him, blurring each boast His craft has made, obscuring words and features, and for this reason, because he cannot accept the lesson he considers himself the most Accursed of God's self-pitying creatures. However, even if the individual ought to be able to take life's sunniness as compensation for its gloomier moments, he ought not to blind himself to those issues which should T)e challenged, although inquiry and challenge may reveal much more that is painful to take. As Chantai says in Malcauchon to the husband who cannot get the truth from his wife, - "if you sure is the truth you want, I could chuck her in it [the waterfall reputed to expose sinners], but only if you can stand the truth." Walcott, even where practical experience implicated him, could stand the truth, could appreciate it in all its painful significance. In chapter IV, 'Tales of the Islands', he examines within a personal context the deeper implications behind the sensual way of life typical of his island, - as of the whole West Indies. The little episode used begins dramatically in the middle of a conversation with a character called 'Doc', about 'El Greco' being an epileptic. Outside I said, "He's a damned epileptic Your boy, El Greco! Goya, he don't lie.' With that significant beginning the situation progresses to the point where Doc suggests that they go and "join the real epileptics." The connection is clear if we consider the nature of epilepsy. The epileptic falls down, usually in vigorous convulsions mounting to a climax of paroxysm. Two of the girls looked good. The Indian said That rain affects the trade. But the atmosphere in which the ensuing encounter takes place strikes the ultimate keynote. In the queer light/we all looked green. The beer and all looked green. 3 13</page><page sequence="12">Now Marvell uses the colour green in a context of rebirth, of spiritual vitality as opposed to, or even embracing paradoxically, the condition of decay which the colour yellow suggests. And so too does Walcott, as in the poem, In a Green Night. Oreen, however, has other connota- tions, that of sickness being particularly, and, as it is in this case, appropriately related, for instance, to sea-sickness; - Walcott uses the metaphor of the sea for the inner life continually. In this atmosphere, one of the girls wrapped an arm around him "like a wreath." From an image connoting sickness, we pass here to a simile suggestive of death. The remark which follows conclusively links up with the end of the poem to give the full implication of all this. 'Our mother earth' I said. 'The great republic in whose womb The dead outvote the quick.' To understand it fully, then, we must examine two later economical but pregnant remarks. We entered the bare room. And then afterwards, walking home in the rain, the encounter over, he "was worried," but Doc said: 'Don't worry, kid, the wages of sin is birth.' When all these remarks and the atmosphere are combined, the con- clusion reached is that such activity spells sickness and deatji to a man's spiritual nature. Its continued practice leads, as the Prelude endorses, to a round of stagnant existence, while its more local repercussions, so feared by a young man entangled in the sensual web of his environment, and explained with such nonchalant humour by Doc, are to quicken in the womb another member of the living dead who on earth "outvote the quick" members, - those truly alive in the sense of physical, mental, and spiritual health or vitality. The conclusion places a much greater significance on the young man's "was worried," as Doc in unwitting irony reveals: "The wages of sin is birth," or, death. Chapter V in the same Tales of the Islands exposes on the other hand the dark vestiges of savagery and superstition which still lurk deep in the heart of the West Indian islands, and whose banishment through enlightened cultural growth has been hindered by white repression. Of course, The priests objected to such savage rites In a Catholic country. But in exposing the particularly primitive savagery of sacrifice and blood drinking with which he is dealing in this poem, Walcott indicates the ironic twist to the whole situation: a religious culture which in its dis- approval marks itself off from such savage practice has its roots in a similar ritual of bloody sacrifice to a God. This is implicit in the 14</page><page sequence="13">ambiguous comment that "one of the fathers was himself a student of black customs." Then follows the description of this little "fete," which, most appropriately, took place in honour of "some anthropologist," - another ambiguous remark, a delicate connoting in one sense, it would seem, at man's anthropomorphic tendencies in his worship of God. The sheep are led to the rivulet with a drum, and the people dance with "absolutely natural grace, remembered from the dark past whence we come." Again there is ambiguity, in "natural grace," which can mean a natural gracefulness in dancing, acquired from our ancestors, or can refer to the state of grace in theology when through the priest's absolu- tion the penitent is once more received into God's divine favour. And with that last reference, it is easy to couple the rest of the poem, and obtain a two dimensional view, one into the present with its repre- hensibly "bloody picnic," and the other into a past of bloody sacrifice and the sprinkling of blood. Bottles of white rum and a brawling booth. They tie the lamb up, then chop off the head, And ritualists take turns drinking the blood. A glance at Exodus, chapter 29 in the Old Testament corroborates the picture of the past. Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood - and sprinkle the blood upon the altar and about. . Thus the poem ends on a significant, revelatory note. Great stuff, old boy; sacrifice, moments of truth. There exists in the poet, nevertheless, a positive vein of faith which, in its increased perception of life's perversity, no doubt helps to strengthen the link of tortured love between himself and his own people, particularly when feeling is stirred by personal loss or public tragedy. In the Elegy to his father, he can be free of all bitterness because of a positive faith acquired from experience. Standing by the calendar he notes that exactly seventeen years have passed since his father's death. The measure of his feeling is amply indicated by the expression which he uses. Having measured the years today by the calendar That marks your seventeenth death, Every year is felt as keenly as though it were the actual year of death. But an honest evaluation reminds him that since his father's absence, they have lived without him well as they have lived well with him. Those left behind after the dying have passed on have to face up to the responsibility and reality of life; and in that mature knowledge which facing such responsibility brings, Walcott cannot "chide death's hands nor hurl death taunts or tantrums" about what might seem otherwise to be life's ultimate tragedy- - consignment to a "yellow grave." More- over, in the strength of Christ's example "who drank the wine and believed the blessed bread"-- and the word "believed" indicates the stress placed on faith,- the poet is able to receive death's gift greater than death itself, -that awareness of a man's spiritual presence after his skeleton has turned to "bright dust." And so his father is there 15</page><page sequence="14">spiritually, more keenly recalled in the memory of his worth and in the emphasis which his physical absence laid on those left behind to face increased responsibility. It does not matter then if the particular faiths which he embraced are one with his light rotting in the sand, for in Christ's lesson there is an essential spiritual truth constituting a spiritual gain greater than physical loss by death, and it is this gift which is bound up "with the forgotten price of man" and which shines from the "perverse beauty of the dead." A similar faith burns in the poem, A City's Death By Fire, which deals with the burning of Castries. The language in this piece is a most efficient vehicle of expression: it fuses shock and grief for hopes shatter- ed in the catastrophe with an appreciation of Christ's spiritual per- manence and power, and allows the poet to emerge victorious, in the renewal of a love "he thought was dead as nails." The fire thus becomes a death and baptism, purging and laying the foundation for more healthy growth, physically for the city, and spiritually for Walcott in the lesson which it has brought him. The fire is regarded as a 'hot gospeller which levelled all but the churched sky,' thus establishing the religious framework within which the concept of baptism by fire can be finally introduced. The predominance of consonantal *Ts" added to the effective "hot" evoke the visual image of a whole city razed to the ground. After that hot gospeller had levelled all but the churched sky, I wrote the tale by tallow of a city's death by fire, Under a candle's eye, that smoked in tears, . . . The candle's eyes "smoked in tears,"- a sympathetic description suggest- ing the grief which Walcott shares with the stricken. All day I walked among the rubbled tales, Shocked at each wall that stood on the street like a liar; "Rubbled" here suggests in its onomatopoeia the crumbling gutted walls of the city, and "tales," coupled with the idea of each wall "standing on the street like a liar," thrusts into the mind the shocking contrast between what they were before and what they are now. The scene is / / / graphically portrayed, up to the noise of a "bird-rocked sky," the com- pound epithet increasing with its onomatopoeia the sense of catastrophe; we can hear the incessant perturbed scream of flapping birds in that expressive sentence with its heavy stresses, beginning emphatically on "loud" and operating throughout. 7 - - / / / Loud was the bird-rocked sky. An introductory note of hope and faith comes in a line serving the dual purpose of describing the clouds as well as hinting at plundering carried out after the fire. . , . all the clouds were bales Torn open by looting, and white, in spite of the fire. 3 16</page><page sequence="15">The note is there in an emphasis on the fact, further underlined by internal assonance, that the clouds are still white. This suggested idea of a purity which cannot be violated is a direct link up with the next line. By the smoking sea where Christ walked, I asked why Should a man wax tears, when his wooden world fails? There is a contrast in those lines between the spiritually eternal nature of Christ and the evanescent physical world as implied in the play on "wax," and in the use of the adjective "wooden" to describe world. •'Wooden" arouses associations of the wooden cross on which Christ was nailed and which has long since decayed to dust, while the spiritual comfort of his presence remains. In town, leaves were paper, but the hills were a flock of faiths; A similar contrast exists in that line, where perishable paper is put against the solid faith-inspiring nature of the hills. Again the object of permanence contrasted is described in terms that deliberately bring to mind Christ the good shepherd- - "a flock of faiths." In such revealed contrasts 'each leaf of nature, - and the contrast here is with the leaves of paper above, - - becomes for Walcott a green breath, Rebuilding a love I thought was dead as nails, Blessing the death and baptism by fire. The personal and shared experiences which we have been dis- cussing gave a fiercely positive note to Walcott's love for his people and his country. This emerges in As John To Patmos. The title of the poem strikes up a note of apocalypse, of revelation. In this revelatory note as John to Patmos, the poet surveys and speaks of his island in personified terms. As a result its visual image looms vividly in our sight: "strewn-silver" of foam on waves, "the wood's crude hair," "rounded breasts of the milky bays, palms, flocks, the green and dead leaves," and from this mirror of personification shines the reflected image of his people. The island is heaven- - away from the dustblown blood of cities ; See the curve of bay, watch the straggling flower, pretty is The wing'd sound of trees, the sparse-powdered sky, when lit is The night. For beauty has surrounded Its black children "Dustblown blood" suggests the desert of desolation and blood into which men have hurled their fellow creatures, with specific reference here to his people. Therefore, says Walcott, As John to Patmos, in each love-leaping air, O slave, soldier, worker under red trees sleeping, hear What I swear now, as John did: To praise livelong, the living and the brown dead. Nor does his love selfishly exclude the other West Indian islands. This is shown in Map of the Antilles where what does appear to be an anti-federation argument turns out to be a mature perception, that 3 17</page><page sequence="16">the quality missing and needed so badly to make the union more than the evanescent mockery it seems, is real peace in which love can flourish. By placing this remark within the classical context of Odysseus in Circean seas, Walcott conclusively indicates the destructive- ly selfish nature of the conflicting passions which surround the federat- ing motive. And so an emerald sea, wild as this one Seemed to Odysseus a destructive ocean, Even as he lingered in Circean seas; Since in no magic port was there such peace As where his love remained. This is a brief Ignored by our first parliaments, to chart The dangerous currents of dividing grief That make our union a mockery of the heart. Time seems not to have falsified his view. The lovely Sea-chantey conveys more positively in its music and West Indian sense of community the unifying note of peace and love which ought to link the islands. It is beautifully and evocatively lyrical, with names which "tremble like needles," "peace of green anchorage," the passage of everyday events,- "flight, and Phyllis return- ed from the Grenadines," baptisms and corals, church bells and trembling mouth organ music, and town streets "orange with week- ripened sunlight." Throughout, the atmosphere of enchantment is well sustained by felicitous expression, and the music kept melodious by a continuance of full vowel sounds, as for example, in the last few lines with their repetitive refrain. The music uncurls with The soft vowels of inlets, The christening of vessels. . . The alphabet of church bells, The peace of white horses, The pasture of ports, The litany of islands, The rosary of archipelagoes, Anguilla, Antigua, Virgin of Guadeloupe, And stone-white Grenada Of sunlight and pigeons, The amen of calm waters The amen of calm waters The amen of calm waters. In tone and expression the poem recalls the verse of Whitman, that poet of Democracy and spiritual union. This helps to emphasize strongly the message so musically relayed. Important, too, and coming emphatically at a point almost in the middle of the poem, is the mystic "repos donnez a ells. . . " Ringing out there is a half -echo of Baudelaire who was forever in search of that state he called "le repos." Walcott, as the allusion effectively suggests, would desire the islands to enjoy a settled state of united and peaceful communion. 3 18</page><page sequence="17">Some considerable part of this love, as we have already indicated briefly, is bound up with the ethnic origin of his West Indian fellows, and the painful slur which the white man has cast on this. Walcott's reaction, however, is a commendable one. There is bitterness, yes, but narrow prejudice, none. What we have is a reconciling passion which indicates the irony in a cruel oppression that carries its own self- afflicting backlash. In A Country Club Romance he tells the story, with an ironic humour through which the metaphor of tennis runs, of the blonde Miss Gautier who fell in love with and married Harris, the black Barbadian. The poem opens with an apt expression, giving both tone and setting. The summer slams the tropic sun Around all year. Then Miss Gautier is shown at tennis which she has made her "deuxiememetier." She is described in language which accurately gives in full-vowelled sounds, movement and stress, the lush heave of her proud bosom, and in fragrant, bright and clear pictures, her fragrance and form. - / - / - / Her breathless bosom rose / - / / / As proud as Dunlop balls. The heavy stress at the end of the first line gives the upward heave of her breasts, and those of the second connote the firm, weighted com- pactness of their flesh; while the comparison, "proud as Dunlop balls," although it could be construed simply as an effort to continue the tennis metaphor, does suggest the rather inhuman colour and context of the pride. We are allowed a sniff of her fragrance in its similarity / / / to that of "the fresh rose on which the white dew falls"; yet even there, if we stress "fresh rose" and the adjective "white," and inner meaning, of white agression despoiling the fresh negro rose, seems to arise. The shadowy illusion appears to be deliberate, for dew is not white, but transparent; in which case the whole image has been made to embody a great deal of irony. Just as the dew which is condensed by the weather, and which faUs on the rose is eventually destroyed in evaporation by the very weather that distilled it, so Miss Gautier who is a jewel of the white tradition, and who marries a negro is eventually destroyed by the very elements in the tradition which produced her. Laburnum bright hair, eyes as blue as ponds, and tanned, bare thighs, humorously and jibingly made superior to Government bonds in their soundness, complete the picture. Mr. Harris works in the civil service, the employment norm of his class; Miss Gautier, on the other hand, works in the bank,- a job with boosted class status, which in the past of the Eastern Caribbean islands was given more or less exclusively to whites. But, ironically, in the face of all racial distinction, Miss Gautier falls in love with Mr. Harris. O love has its revenges, Love whom man has devised; 3 19</page><page sequence="18">The second line suggests that man has devised a peculiar emotion which, despite its paradoxical demonstrations to the contrary, he chooses to call love. For the outcome of the marriage in which "they lay down like slazengers,- and the simile suggests the sexual vigour of the match, - was that "She was ostracized. Even though she her- self was sufficiently free from prejudice to marry him, the harsh love- lessness of the traditional attitude to which she belonged would not permit her to do so in peace. Group snobbery hurt her and set up an inner conflict which affected the marriage. But Walcott makes no bones about it; the relationship is obviously wrecked by its incom- patibility, by the insensitive, unrefined insensibility of Harris, - who cannot understand and treat sympathetically his wife's symptoms.- in conflict with the whole tradition of white superiority from which she cannot escape without subconscious torture. They had "a fine set of twins," and "her thanks went up to God that her children would not work in banks"; but as the pressure grew, her worries led to an occasional drink which, we are intended to assume, grew from occasional to habitual. Mr. Harris could not understand. He said, "Since you so damn frisky, Answer this backhand!" And yet Harris must have been aware that the failure sprang from a basic discrepancy between their cultural backgrounds. His remark, "Be Jeez, it serve us right," suggests this. We are led to believe that Miss Gautier eventually died of heartbreak, and the final verse has an ambiguity that emphasizes the radical and irreconcilable difference fostered by the white oppression of ages. While the almonds yellow the beaches And the breezes pleat the lake, And the blondes pray God to 'teach us To profit from her mistake.' If A Country Club Romanea exposes the irony behind racial pre- judice, Ruins Of A Great House records the poet's bitterness at the cruel past; but it ends on a note of reconciliation through which oppressed and oppressor merge in a common humanity. First, we are given in a graphic portrait the decadence of the Great House. The house is like a corpse. - the dislocated stones its broken members. "Its moth-like girls are mixed with candle dust." Here, "moth-like" very effectively conveys the flightiness of the girls who once peopled it, but does so in an atmosphere of funereal decay of which the moth is a symbol. The whole picture is one of decay: lizards with dragonish claws in possession, gates streaked with stain, and here and there axle and coach wheel buried in silt and muck. Three crows flap away at the poet's approach, symbolic perhaps of the British Isles, but they can also in the significance of their number, three, suggest a decadence which has swung full circle. They "settle creaking the eucalyptus boughs," and this noise adds further to the ruins the air of rust, dilapidation, and disuse. The next two lines are perhaps the most powerful. 20</page><page sequence="19">/ - A smell of dead limes quickens in the nose The leprosy of Empire. The appeal to the sense of smell, the rotten pungency felt in the nostrils by the evocative "quickens" with its sharp consonants, and the very unpleasant associations of the word "leprosy" cast a horrid pall over an already ugly scene of decay. The mention of Faulkner's 'south in stone' adequately gives the context in which the ruined Great House is to be taken, - one of white aggression and incest. like Fauljcner's south in stone, Deciduous beauty prospered and is gone. Description of the very lawn with trees growing on it adds to the diseased note: But where the lawn breaks in a rash of trees A spade below dead leaves will ring the bone Of some dead animal or human thing Fallen from evil days, from evil times. Its condition, as the lines indicate, has a specific cause: something is buried there. We can hear the sound of the spade on bone in the second line, while the deliberately indistinct differentiation between "dead animal" and "human thing" implies the presence of some buried slave, perhaps, fallen from evil times in which he was no more than a convenient animal under the cruel yoke of a slave master. But now, the poet remarks, these "imperious rakes are gone, their bright girls gone, the river flows obliterating hurt." No rankling hate remains in his heart. Although the house may have shielded its owners' guilt behind the iron grillwork "of exiled craftsman," it could not hide them, as it even now cannot hide itself, from the "worm's rent." Death is the great leveller, and as he listens, it is as though above the wind shaking in the limes he can hear "what Kipling heard; the death of a great empire, the abuse of ignorance by sword and bible." The reference to Kipling is meaningful. Although quite an imperialist himself, Kipling had compassion for the other side. Man cannot tell but Allah knows How much the other side was hurt, and Walcott's mention of him suggests the balance towards which the poem is making. It is worth noticing, too, that Walcott again quotes Kipling in his play, Franklin in which at one point the voices of children can be heard singing that poet's great recessional, 'Far-called our navies melt away; On dune and headland sinks the fire: Lo, all our pomp of yesterday Is one with Nineveh and Tyre! Judge of the Nations, spare us yet, Lest we forget - lest we forget! ' ; for the play makes towards a similar balance within an atmosphere of tragedy. In it, the white captain, Franklin's imperialistic and harsh 3 21</page><page sequence="20">side is revealed; yet at the same time, he seems in some measure to have identified himself with the natives of the Antillean islet/Ironically again, however, the white tradition makes impossible real fraternity with the hate-bridled natives, and humiliated and doubly saddened by the defection of two wives as well as by accusations of his First Mate's murder, he burns himself to death on his own vessel, no longer able to face life's harshness. But to come back to Ruins of A Great House, what Walcott does not omit to make clear is the guilt of ancestral murderers like Hawkins, Raleigh and Drake, peddlers in the slave trade, and the sick greeness of the age symbolized by a rotting lime "whose stench became the channel galleon's text." And what we have in that line there is the stench of flesh from dead negroes rotting in the holds of galleons. For Walcott, "the rot remains with us, the men are gone,"- remains in the unresolved problem of which the Great House is a rotting reminder. Momentarily his rage blazes; and then comes flood- ing back the reminder that England too was once "deranged" by the "vain expense of bitter faction." The reality of his own race's suffer- ing makes it possible to appreciate fully 'how much the other side must have been hurt' in its own days of trouble, and all bitterness ends in compassion, So differently from what the heart arranged: 'as well as if a manor of thy friend's. . . ' To A Painter In England also ends with reconcilement, but this time Walcott goes a step further in frank examination to indicate, in the passing of the empire, a "Sabbath logic" which "we can take or refuse." The idea of stagnancy recurs as he addresses the painter. Where you rot under the strict, grey industry Of cities of fog and winter fevers. . . But this time the reference is used as a contrast with the sunniness of "personal islands for which Gauguins sicken" to suggest another kind of desolation found in these islands, of which the parched nature of the April season becomes symbolic. you may find it difficult to imagine This April as a season where the tide burns Black, leaves crack into ashes from the drought, A dull red burning, like heart's desolation. And as he muses on the canoes with their comic names, resting under trees stricken with "a nervous spinsterish quiet," the poet comes to the central point which he is concerned to make. The canoes remind him of the painter's chief scenes for painting, and the days of instruction at his villa when they "watched his serious experience, learning." And so he knows that the artist will understand how desolate he feels to see this gift of the islands 'wasting before the season'. You who defined with an imperious palette The several postures of this virginal island, You understand how I am lost to have Your brush's zeal and not to be explicit. 3 22</page><page sequence="21">When we put the reference to the post impressionist school of painting as represented by "Gaugins" with the remarks in the section quoted above, Walcott's deeper meaning becomes clear. Post-impressionist painting was dedicated to expressing the inner truth of a structure as opposed to its surface effects of light treated by the impressionists. In the light of this, the painter with his chief scenes becomes representa- tive of imperial England, once defining with an imperious sweep of her arm the several policies of an island virginal in its experience of governing; --an England with its imperial dominance over the West Indies now supervened. But the inner truth of the matter is that with this direction withdrawn, his people, of whom Walcott is representa- tive in the poem, find themselves with the zeal to direct their affairs and without the skill to do so, with the result that the gift of directing, bestowed prematurely, "wastes before its season." The closing lines continue the post-impressionist metaphor, and seem to suggest that this skill which the West Indian has not learnt gives vision into the inner truth of things, and reveals a "Sabbath logic we can take or refuse." This last remark would appear to mean that left to itself islands such as his, where the general attitude in the past has been to treat every day like Sunday, or in the words of his Prelude,. *to make a holiday of situations', must fare desolately. Thus, the individual is left to whatever decision he would take. He can either stick blindly to his country, desert it, or withdraw into a rose-coloured dream world of his own. For him, it would appear, it is a logic which argues for love and reconciliation by which a sensible, generous approach to in- dependence can be gained. It is a logic that wins his love, but one to which the blind world still cannot open its eyes, though he "would inform that world of its flesh." The idea of native inadequacy express- ed by Walcott in this poem comes out more openly in the second of two poems on the passing of an Empire. In the small coffin of his house, the pensioner, A veteran of the African campaign, Bends as if threading an eternal needle, . . . Or lifts his desert squint to hear The children singing, Rule, Britannia, Rule, As if they needed practice to play dead. Boys will still pour their blood out for a sieve Despite his balsam eye and doddering jaw, And if one eye should weep, would they believe In such a poor flag as an empty sleeve? In this poem the complete inadequacy of embalmed native helpless- ness and febrility to direct are symbolically revealed, the arguments against the other side notwithstanding. Within the context of such experiences, the individual must face up to responsibility, - a hard thing to do, when all around, the world's harshness and perplexity are so evident. In A Lesson For Sunday, even in the pleasant Sunday contemplation of a little boy and girl playing in the open, die finds evidence of this. As he watches, the two children with a "common pin between them" attempt in turns to pierce 1 1 3 23</page><page sequence="22">the eyes and gouge out the abdomen of a helpless praying mantis, and shriekingly protest when a black maid removes them from the scene. An effective contrast is made between 'the maimed teetering thing' that is left of the mantis as it attempts to fly away, and the little girl, Herself a thing of summer light, Frail as a flower in this blue August air, Not marked for some late grief that cannot speak. One tends to see the mantis and the negro maid linked in the poet's mind, with the mantis symbolic of his race, while the little girl with her fair fragility becomes identified with its white antagonists. Whether this is so or not, his mind "swings inward on itself once more" in ques- tioning fear. Everywhere is "the heredity of cruelty," and he takes the long look back to see where "choice is born," where individual responsibility begins and ends. The Banyan Tree, Old Year's Night gives us this process mosit clearly. It is prefaced by a quotation from Baudelaire's Voyage, and once more the parallel aids the contrast. Baudelaire, in a sense, set a new pattern by giving us a look into a divided mind and heart. For him, life was a voyage of discovery, an exploration of dark, conflicting elements in the soul, and no other writer before, it appears, - Swedenborg, Hugo, the Gothic novelists, Hoffman, - none, had attempt- ed anything quite like it. Je vois distinctement des mondes singuliers, Et de ma clairvoyance extatique victime, Je traine des serpents qui mordent mes souliers. In this respect, we see the parallel in Walcott. unlike Baudelaire, how- ever, he is not merely a poet of introspection, but, significantly, is concerned, as we have seen, with his society and the part which it plays in life's conflict. In this poem on the banyan tree Walcott looks back, then, on the days of his childhood and remembers their activities and the premature intimations of adulthood gleaned, in almost the same way as Baudelaire did. Through the narrow focus of memory he sees the damp park in the square no larger than a stamp. It is the year's end, and the coloured bulbs in the park "linking the withered fountain" are evocative to him of his games on that occasion with other whooping "small savages." As the town's centre, the square becomes the focal point from which, in his memory, radiates the "petered pinwheel of dead streets" bringing back to him the "squibs of boyish jokes," sticky sweets, the brass band with its marching music playing for "children punished in their window gaols," and, as is often the case with memory, bringing back those tiny details sharply, such as "gusts of tumbling papers, babies, kites blown around the kiosk bandrails in the wind." But even as he thinks, the panorama of scenes fades on the memory's screen, "absence crowds the mind," and suddenly there flashes back a picture of the banyan tree on Old Year's night, the night before the new year of new resolutions, continued growth, and changing events. 24</page><page sequence="23">Soaring from littered roots, blackened with rain, With inaccessible arms the banyan tree Heaves in the last year's drizzle to explain What age could not, responsibility. An impression of the tree, it appears, becomes fused with these child- hood scenes to synthesize and add meaning to the whole range of recollection. The tree is vividly imprinted on his mind,- its littered roots, blackened with rain, its movement, in the fine drizzle of an old year's night soaking it; it becomes personified. in his mind, and is seen as a symbol of responsibility, having to weather, as he must, all the storms of life. In that flash of insight, it more powerfully explains for him than age could at that time, the individual's responsibility to life. Then he remembers how in heavy rain, foul canals at the town's "rotting edges" served as channels for "crouched black children" to send their little paper boats on "little tours," till the boats were caught up in silt on the other side, and sank after their short voyage. Once more his mind makes the connection; they remind him of his setting out on the sea of life's discovery, and just as those small boats "dare each season," so he thanks whatever wind "compelled his flight," "what- ever rages urged his impossible exile"; impossible because the process of discovery involved such close identification with his island and people, that it could hardly make possible any alienation from them. This is why his mind is so able to fuse his childhood memories with those of much more recent experience and see a unified pattern. In the words of the initial quotation from Baudelaire, "How small is our world," how unified, "through the mirror of memory!" But as his mind returns again to the park, it is rocked with the fear that these insights and truths gained may be suddenly extinguished, as symbolized by the sudden vanishing from his memory of the park with its bulbs of coloured light. He can recall, however, that their glimmerings began even in his childhood. Even on silvery days, that classic fount Being withered to the root, its throat as hoarse As the last nurse's cry, could not surmount My growing fear with clarity from a source No parent knew. Their source was unknown. Whether his youthful soul divined in the marching brass band the music of truth, or whether,- as Traherne would have believed, - its wisdom glimpsed a vision of the secret, in the fountain's failing arch, he cannot tell. In that reference to the fountain there is the implication that it became a symbol in its failing of the growth from youth to adulthood, in which responsibility imposes itself on the individual, bringing with it a melancholy that may have originated in his childhood. or did we march To the brass tunes of truth? Did I divine Some secret in the fountain's failing arch, And was that infant melancholy mine? 25</page><page sequence="24">What is more likely, of course, as often happens, is that the poet is imposing a pattern of adult interpretation on childhood hints, which, at that age, mean little or nothing owing to a relatively large gap in worldly knowledge, but which in the light oí later adult experience suddenly open up whole vistas of meaning. The final point which he makes, however, is that "if it were so," if the infant melancholy was his, it is still there, and the tree remains to him symbolic of his own position in which he is forced to bear the burden of life's responsibility in a world where man has no place "to lay his head," but is blown "whithersoever the wind listeth." If it were so, it still remains, its sources Blank as the rain on the deserted mind, Dumb as the ancient Indian tree that forces Its grieving arms to keep the homeless wind. It is worth mentioning before we leave the poem that in the verse preceding the one above, Walcott brings off a deliberate echo of Keats' Ode To A Nightingale- for the poem is essentially the St. Lucian's in tone and language,- an echo which expands the significance, and emphasizes the return to a state of burdened reality, childhood experiences left behind. Where exactly has Walcott 's voyage taken him? The question of responsibility, though accepted in the above-mentioned poem, brought no ease to his mind. The banyan tree with its 'arms open to the home- less wind expressed best for him his position. However, we may see emerging in other experiences a somewhat more settled frame of mind in which the will to know fully the true self eventually, as in the poem, In A Green Night, leads to that quiet resolve of "the comprehending heart." In A Letter From Brooklyn, for example, he learns a lesson from a very old lady who writes from Brooklyn to tell him that she knew his father and what a good man he was. So incomparably does Walcott portray the lady that we see her on the pages of imagination writing in "a spidery style," her trembling hand translating its nervous- ness into shaky letters on paper. He shows us the "veined hand, pellucid on paper," and in the often interrupted motions of its quiver- ing progress, shows how fragile and how often broken is the thread of thought in her mind which that hand seeks to transcribe. The mind has lost its strong sense of logical continuity, "the filaments from which her phrases are hung" dim to his sense, but when they catch, because of their simplicity, the thoughts come home with an impact,- -"shining like steel." And this old lady, herself with very little life left to live, can in praising his father, write: He is twenty-eight years buried; he was called home And is, I am sure, doing greater work. "Called home." To Walcott, such simple acceptance of the fact that life must be faced with equanimity and resolve, is a lesson in responsi- bility. The old lady "restores his sacred duty to the Word." If she is physically withered, such strength of character argues an inner beauty which elicits tears, and makes it impossible to regard her as detached 26</page><page sequence="25">from the world "which breaks its lovers so," as it threatens to break him. To the old lady, Heaven is ... the place where painters go, All who bring beauty on frail shell or horn, and this is added encouragement to the poet whose aim as artist is to take the evil and ugliness of the world and paint it into a meaningful universal pattern, in which love and harmony are transmuting colours. It is an inspiring lesson, bringing him strength, and dissolving in power- ful measure the pain and grief caused by human loss and affliction. So this old lady writes, and again I believe, I believe it all, and for no man's death I grieve. Experiences of this nature help to bring some ease, indeed, but the positive joy to be found in life is not possible without adequate knowledge of the true self. The poet expresses this in Allegre, on a beautiful morning in Nature's unending supply of beautiful mornings, replete with pigeons on hill-slopes, veering in silvery and white flight as they pass from sunlight to the blue shadows of the hills, with singing birds, forest thick with blue haze and smoke from the workman's fire, wild bees and briar smoke, boyish shouts from the valley, and the stream flowing by, calm at the edges. In all this radiance of a morning filled with elation, Walcott finds that the elation can still be useless and empty where there yet exists estrangement from certain aspects of the true self. No temples, yet the fruits of intelligence, No roots yet the flowers of identity, No cities but white seas in sunlight, Laughter and doves, like young Italy. Yet to find the true self is arduous, And for us, especially, the elation can be useless and empty As this pale, blue ewer of the sky, Loveliest in drought. It is an estrangement which is reflected even in the love of a man's life, for if he fails to understand the real motives of the self, if there is a gap in that inner cognizance which must help to find a real basis for emotional attachment, then when the obliterating rains of time fall, his whole house of love may crumble from its foundation and be washed away. This is the thought that comes over in A Care- ful Passion, where southern memories of the past contrast and con- flict with Jamaican experiences of the present to expose the bitter illusions of marital love. One line in the poem full of meaning, "Hearts learn to die well that have died before," completely endorses its open- ing quotation from a Jamaican song. Hosanna, I build me house, Lawd, De rain come wash it 'way. And at the heart of such disillusionment is the failure to discern with- in the true self between infatuation and the love which springs from 11* 3 27</page><page sequence="26">deeper roots. Too often is the former feeling connoted with love, so much so that in Parang, the second cuatroman expresses in an idiom delightfully Eastern Caribbean an extreme view of the idea. Boy every damned tune them tune Of love that will last forever Is the wax and the wane of the moon Since Adam catch body-fever. A similar view, though not carried to its extreme, is expressed in A Careful Passion. There, it throws more light on that gap in self- knowledge; for when the self-seeking heart desperately searches "for some mirror to believe/' it is apt to see, in the ''stirring of the old original curse within strange eyes," the true gospel. And that is all the truth .... All is exhilaration on the eve, Especially when the self-seeking heart So desperate for some mirror to believe Finds in strange eyes the old original curse. So cha cha cha, begin the long goodbyes. . . Finally, in that enchantingly evocative poem, In A Green Night, the "fable becomes perfected," and all these experiences of life, bring- ing with them their bitter potions, coalesce into that wise calm of "the comprehending heart" which nothing "can quail." In the orange tree with its burden of fruit, Walcott can see an adequate symbol of this mature state,- The orange tree, in various light, Proclaims perfected fables now That her last season's summer height / - / / - Bends from each over-burdened bough. In that first verse he gives us a clear visual picture of the orange tree bathed in contrasting shades of light. From this point, run-on lines, alliteration with a different consonantal system in each line, contrast between the height of the tree in the third line and its bending in the fourth, initial heavy stress in the fourth line introducing a disturbed trochaic rhythm and followed by a heavy spondee, plosive quality of alliterative words in the same line, --all these forces build up to a weighted climax which allows us to see most vividly a very significant detail of the tree,- -its profusion of fruit under whose weight each loaded bough bends. The aim, of course, is to let us see as fully as possible the tree's maturity, so that the comparison being made may be perfectly clear. The tree, then, with its full, ripe fruit in summer, represents the poet's mind matured by experience. And like the tree, the mind has its seasons other than summer, too,- its winter of cold, uncomforted barrenness, its spring of light, slowly dawning on the mind, illuminating 3 28</page><page sequence="27">its dark recesses, until, brilliantly lit, it has reached its splendid summer of perfection as represented by the orange tree. The tree, however, when it reaches that stage of maturity passes beyond into a season of decay, each "golden sun" of fruit luxuriously dipping the magic of its maturity in the cool of night, only to have its splendour quailed in the harsh fires of the Autumn sun by day. Or perhaps the dew of night and the dust of parched noon, which in summer co- operate to add lustre to the tree's maturity, may in autumn conspire to spread over all that very splendour the rust of decay so successfully repelled throughout the summer. For if by night each golden sun Burns in a comfortable creed, By noon harsh fires have begun To quail those splendours which they feed. Or mixtures of the dew and dust That early shone her orbs of brass, Mottle her splendours with the rust She sought all summer to surpass. So too with the mind. The "comfortable creeds" which it works out in a period of maturity, and in which its sun of intelligence may com- placently burn for a time are soon destroyed by the steadily increasing intellectual heat which brought it some degree of maturity. Or per- haps the dust of doubt and uncertainty may insidiously mix with its dew of ripening intelligence to corrupt all with the rust of despair. However it may happen, the change will come, and as with the orange tree, the mind then experiences its autumn season in which outworn creeds and wayward beliefs fall, like the "moult of leaves" from the tree, to expose fresh areas of truth and light. And so by the law of change and progressive development, both Nature and man revolve in cycles towards increasing maturity. Summer, autumn, and each autumn is a "zone truer than the tropical" one before it, because it leads to yet another summer of greater promise and maturity than the one before. By such strange, cyclic chemistry That dooms and glories her at once As green yet ageing orange tree, The mind enspheres all circumstance. The contrasts in that verse touch off one another's distinctions and become ultimately lost in the all-embracing sphere of mind. Walcott's use of the word "green" there takes on a dual meaning, - "green" in the sense of being unripe, immature; and "green" connoting the spiritual bloom which comes in old age. The latter connotation is adopted from Marvell, as is the poem's title which is taken from a line in The Bermudas. He hangs in shades the orange bright Like golden lamps in a green night. Marvell's poem describes the fervent belief but unattainable aspiration of some Protestant refugees that they have reached in the West Indies 3 29</page><page sequence="28">a life-haven of eternal splendour and perfection. Thus, the allusion serves to emphasize the point that the cyclic history of man is one in whose annals he can never reach, while on earth, the still point of perfection. And so we move steadily to the poem's conclusion. No holiday splendour, says Walcott, no purposeless basking in a vacation of indifference, can calm the darkening fear in the poet's mind when he has travelled so far in his search for greater understanding that he leaves far behind his "passionate hatred," the "visionary rage" which has its roots in limited conception. But, the search ended and the goal reached, fear departs forever, and the heart surges in the power • of its new found comprehension. Thus, if subsequently in the con- tinued cycle of existence, the harsh fires of intellect appear to blight the poet's talent bursting into a summer splendour, neither the autumn's "fierce noon" nor winter's "lampless night" can daunt the heart exulting in the comprehension that autumn must fail, winter yield to spring, and a more glorious summer come. Not ever again can life's changing experiences, however bitter their potions, "quail his comprehending heart." The orange tree, in various light Proclaims that fable perfect now That her last season's summer height Bends from each over -burdened bough. We leave Walcott at this stage of his experience. Indeed, no poetic statement could go further in defining the calm which ought to exist at the heart of life's diverse stormy aspects. To use his own metaphor; in a journey made painful by the rough seas of experience, he has arrived, though not at the end, since for all of us the life craft must continue to weather new storms of experience till the final harbour; but his has drawn to itself from continual weathering a power which creates its own calm to brave subsequent passages. We cannot under- estimate the greatness of his achievement. It was his ambition to write "verse crisp as sand, clear as sunlight, cold as the curled wave." His success has been superlative. The language of his poems is his own, compact, precise, classical, devoid of unconscious imitation; their quality of thought and recorded experience, rare. Dipping freely into the universal and traditional current of poetry, he has fused the elements of his West Indian situation and experience with those of the world's experience, so that the relevance of both to life's essential meaning stands out all the more, and has done it with such skill that his own originality has been enshrined.
