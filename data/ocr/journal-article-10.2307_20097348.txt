<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review of International Studies (1993), 19, 385-399 Printed in Great Britain On the idealist origins of the realist theory of international relations* RONEN P. PALAN AND BROOK M. BLAIR Introduction A theory, writes Anthony Wilden, like any other adaptive system, must have a survival value. It is impossible, he continues, 'for a theory not to have a referent or a goal outside itself, since "pure truth" not only does not exist, it has no survival value whatsoever.'1 Wilden's reference to the 'external' goal of a theory suggests that theories carry subliminal messages which exceed the strict boundary of their textual content. An effective technique for identifying the political and normative undertones communicated by theories is an inquiry into those areas which supposedly of peripheral significance to them. The debate over realism could benefit from such an examination. Realist theory is generally considered the most coherent interpretation available of the nature and causes of political events such as armed struggles, military alliances, diplomatic negotiations and relations between states in general. Realists achieved an elegant theory of international relations by pointing out the inherently conflicting interests of different political communities within the international system; they show that the unique character of international relations derives from the very nature of the 'unities', or the political communities which form its parts. In our view, the 'peripheral' or problematic side of realism lies in the very conceptualization of these unities, namely, the nation-state. Although there are different forms of realism, there is nevertheless one unifying idea at work in all of them: that the international arena is inhabited by unitary actors called states. These states are then viewed as discrete entities functioning almost as individuals in a societal context. This idea gives rise to a complex of anthropocentric notions about the state and its activities in the international arena. Traditional realists describe the interaction between states in terms such as 'enmity' and 'friendliness' in a 'society of states'; neo-realists like Keohane and Nye speak of the state in terms of 'sensitivity' and 'vulnerability'; and Waltz even refers to the 'survival instinct' of states.2 This * We would like to thank David George and Tim Gray for their helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper. 1 Anthony Wilden, System and Structure: Essays in Communication and Exchange (London, 1972), p. 303. 2 On enmity and friendliness among nations, see Arnold Wolfers, Discord and Collaboration: Essays on International Politics.

Blair discourse, which treats the state as a unified and autonomous rational actor, creates a shared framework for thinking about what is normally described as the 'international system'. It permits realism to reduce international relations to an arena in which states pursue egoistic interests. Yet as the development of modern psychology has taught us, the ego is not a unified and self-conscious whole, but a complex of forces which merely appears to be a unified entity. The same may well be said of state theory: confusing a manner of speech with its underlying reality, the tendency has been to speak as a matter of convenience of states as actors in the international system, and thereby to lose sight of the forces which are actually involved in their composition. The problematic of the state has generated a fundamental cleavage within the study of international relations. The traditional school of realism, modified to some degree by the contributions of neo-realism, still maintains that the state can be conceptionalized as a unified body, with an autonomous will of its own; all other approaches, beginning with the tentative steps taken by the interdependence school, and extending to the structuralist and the neo-structuralist approaches to international relations, have based their challenge to realism upon a recognition of the importance of the intricate process through which the state forms its so-called interests.3 In light of much evidence which contests the unified conception of the state, thus also suggesting a broader and more problematic conception of international relations, one must question how this situation came about in the first place. How did realists ever arrive at this conception of the state as a unitary actor? Conventional historiography traces the origins of the international component of realism to the era of the Second World War and has identified its philosophical roots in the works of Thucydides, Machiavelli and Hobbes.4 This presentation however, is somewhat misleading. To begin with, the classical philosophers had very little to say about the nature of the international system as such; furthermore, their views permeate Liberal and Marxist conceptions of the international system just as much as Realist interpretations. But, above all, the study of the classical philosophers tell us very little about the two major components of the realist idea, namely, the state and the international system. In our view, there is another somewhat neglected period which plays perhaps a greater role in forming the realist theory of international relations. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that 'political realism', an expression coined by Heinrich von Treitschke,5 was greatly influenced by early nineteenth century idealist and romantic thought. In a recent article, Zbigniew Pelczynski has demonstrated that the entire realist edifice was already contained in Hegel's writings; another masterly exposition of realist thought?and still one of the best to date?can be 3 On the Structuralist, or world systems approach, see Wallerstein Immanuel, The Modern World-System (London, 1974).

This article therefore aims to chart the relationship between realism and its early modern predecessors in the romantic and idealist movements of the end of the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Germany; in the process, we hope to underscore not only the tenuous thread which unites these two bodies of thought, but also to mark the gulf which has eventually?almost as if by necessity?come to separate them. By exploring these romantic, enlightenment and post-enlightenment contributions to realism?and hence placing the latter in this historical frame work?we hope to be better placed to engage in critical evaluation of realism's relevance for the study of international politics as a whole. The modern re-emergence of the organic theory of the state. The unitary conception of the state has a long and complex history, spanning from the late period of Ancient Greek thought to contemporary realist theory.7 There have been, of course, a number of variations on the conception of the unity of the state. The Baroque concept of the unitary sovereign state is the one most often cited in contemporary Realist writings. However, the Baroque conception is rooted in social contract theory and consequently has always been sensitive to the distinction between rulers and ruled: the sovereign and his subjects. Inter-state relations were still linked directly to the character and personality of the king: 'A great people', declared Boussuet 'is united in a single person, une raison secrete shut within a single head and governing all the body of the State'.8 Thus, 'state policy . . .'is necessarily 'unknown and obscure to all those who do not govern'.9 This theme of the 'artificial' or mechanical unity of a people, who by consent delegate authority to the rulers, emphasized the existing gulf between rulers and ruled.10 International affairs were then defined by the relationship between one sovereign and the next, with the personal ambitions and character of the rulers determining the nature of international politics. Given the capacity for personal rule by the absolutist sovereign, the associated conception of the relations between states could not have resulted in the current abstract, ahistorical theory of 6 Zbigniew Pelczynski, 'Hegel and International History', in Philip Windsor Reason and History: Or only a History of Reason.

Blair international politics which stresses the structural constraints of the 'international system'. Modern realism could only emerge after the advent of the organic theory of the state, as developed during the course of the nineteenth century. It was only then that the activities of the state in international politics were deemed to derive from the international political community itself. Under the new organic theory, the state as a sovereign entity was endowed with an autonomous will, only marginally subject to the individual will of the citizens of the state. In the works of the main postwar realists such as Bull, Carr, Morgenthau and Waltz,11 the state itself?and not its components, be they rulers or citizens?serves as the central feature of international politics. How, though, could a political association, a mere aggregation of people, ever act, or be thought to act, like a prince? What were the stages by which the socio-economic entity came to be regarded as a person? And how was this shift from the sovereign individual to the sovereign society squared with the modern conception of the state? It is an explosion of ideas in the nineteenth century, particularly in Germany, which gave rise to the modern12?and still current? version of the realist theory of international relations. Meinecke has argued that the philosophical image of the German people as a unified spiritual whole had been elaborated in great detail by the time of the French occupation.13 None the less, as Reinhold Aris demonstrates, the great catalyst for the development of German idealism was the experience of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic con quests. The extraordinary accomplishments of the Napoleonic armies on the European battlefields convinced many German observers that the 'spirit' at work in 'the people' was more real that speculative.14 There emerged a powerful and mobilizing image of the Germanic people brought together under a unified system of rule, with 'the people' being regarded as an organic entity possessing a unique personality. But these romantic longings for a pristine Medieval past needed a practical outlet in a world which was becoming increasingly dominated by states. The con summation of this romantic image with the practical necessities of the new external political setting generated enormous interest in 'the Idea of the State' as opposed to its none-too-promising concrete manifestations at that time in Germany. Many prominent German thinkers in the nineteenth century, from Philosophy (Herder, Fichte, Hegel), History (Ranke, Treitschke), Law (Savigny, Jellinek) and Theology (A. Mueller, Schleiermacher), detached their investigation of the state from its empirical manifestations. They focused instead on the phenomenology of the State as Idea. This development took place alongside criticism of the enlightenment project, with its new sense of 'public' reason, its radical cosmopolitanism and liberalism, 11 Bull, The Anarchical Society; Carr, Twenty Years' Crisis; Morgenthau Politics Among Nations; Waltz, Man, the State and War. 12 The word 'Modern' has, by even the most conservative standards, obviously become problematic in itself; however, for our own purposes, we shall use it loosely to suggest a cluster of images ranging from the Enlightenment to the Napoleonic?an expanse leading from the radicalization of the idea of the Nation-State to the transcendental aspects of Reason. 13 See Friedrich Meinecke, Cosmopolitanism and the Nation State, trans. Robert Kimber (Princeton, 1970). 14 See Reinhold Aris, History of Political Thought in Germany From 1789 to 1815 (London, 1965). For similar interpretation, see G. P. Gooch Germany and the French Revolution (London, 1965).</page><page sequence="5">Idealist origins of the realist theory of international relations 389 and its problematization of the nature of history and social change. The liberal conception of an immanent 'mechanical' social order underwent a radical critique from the perspective of the modern subject as one informed, for better or worse, by a transcendental rationale.15 Paradoxically, the criticism was linked to one of the profoundest effects of the French Revolution: the radicalization of the idea that progress could be accom plished under the aegis of the state, by means of a thorough-going reform of its constitution and public institutions. States or 'political monsters', as Herder called them, were depicted as positive historical forces in their own right.16 The enlighten ment and romantic factions found in the state a vehicle for progress, embodied in the concrete manifestation of the Volksgeist. The nation as an organic unity The emergence of the modern state, as embodied in the French Revolution and in Napoleon's imperial incursions, represented something altogether new in European history, as exciting to some as it was threatening others?and especially for those having the most direct contact with these novel political innovations. During the period, the notion of 'the sovereign as King, the most resilient element of the old order, was to undergo a fundamental transformation into 'the sovereign national body'. This transformation is commonly described by the concept of 'popular sovereignty'. Yet the emergence of popular sovereignty reflects a deeper change in the understanding of the relationship between individuals in society, on the one hand, and society and state, on the other. The belief that an organic-like relationship attaches individuals to their societies lies at the core of all forms of nationalism. It was J. C. Herder who, already in 1776, advanced what would become the common nationalist criticism of liberal thought in general, and social contract theory in particular, namely, that they misrepresented the characteristics of a natural human community. Herder thereby laid down the foundations for a novel reconceptualization of both society and the state. Pre-dating Hegel by several decades, he outlined what has now come to be viewed as a central tenet of the Hegelian conception of history: . . . human nature even at its best, is not an independent deity: it has to learn everything, develop through progress, keep on advancing through gradual struggle. Naturally it will develop for the most part, or only, in those directions which give it cause for virtue, for struggle or for progress. Each form of human perfection, then, is, in a sense, national and time-bound and, considered most specifically, individual.17 15 See Immanuel Kant, Perpetual Peace and Other Essays on Politics, History, and Morals, trans, and intro. Ted Humphrey (Indianapolis, 1983). Again amongst numerous others, one might well cite J. G. Herder's works. On the more extremist side, Heinrich von Kleist's Hermannsschlact as well as his remarks on the repercussions of Kantian epistemology are of some interest here, to say nothing of several comments made by Heinrich Heine on the underlying nature of Kant's philosophical project. 16 /.

Blair This was one of the first times that 'human nature' was released from the absolute and theologically-based dichotomy of 'good and evil', becoming hereafter an aspect of the evolutionary process itself. The significance of this development lies in its reformulation of the nature of the human being, on the one hand, and the nature of history, on the other. Rather than being bound by universal law, human development was seen by Herder to occur within the context of a particular culture. Human nature thus took on a relativistic quality and human beings were seen to be the agents of their own self-transformation in history. As we will see shortly, these ideals were transmuted subsequently into a new form in idealist thought; just as human beings and individual cultures were seen to be the animating force of their own histories, so in turn was the state viewed as the agent of its own internal as well as external transformation. States, in short, become 'actors' in their own right. Herder's ideas, however, stretched far beyond that; he re-cast the relationship between philosophy and history in an entirely new light, placing history in a privileged position (and thus transcending the Augustinian synthesis). But the relationship between human nature and history could be reversed: if history explained human nature, then human nature could also explain history. The two poles of the idealist interpretation of history were thus established: at one end there is the political struggle of the human soul striving endlessly to improve upon itself, and, at the other, behind the cloak of its own self-interest, the soul, also improves history.18 But between these two poles a link had to be established in order to allow for an unsuspected yet necessary connection between the lone, isolated soul and the capaciousness of world-history?one concealed from the other by their sheer difference in scale. The idealists, in other words, faced a strategic problem in the linkage between 'world history' and the isolated individual. Herder's solution was to introduce an intermediary and supportive structure which operated as a transmitter between the two poles. He found this intermediary framework for social activity in 'the nation'.19 For Herder the nation was an instinctive and organic repository for the totality of all human interaction providing a pre-political locus for social meaning: the notion represented the fundamental network of social relationships in which people could conceive their activity. Similarly in his 'Address to the German Nation', Fichte developed new ideas about the nature of national culture. In Landherr's words: Fichte considered the community to be of divine origin, and for this reason its cultivation and development is the main duty of the human being. The human being cannot be 18 History here grasped both as an objective work in itself and also as the necessary and concrete preconditions for human activity as a whole. 19 The expression 'nation' conjured up at the time ideas of law, order and progress as opposed to the arbitrariness and tyranny typical of dynastic governments (see Max Rouche, Introduction to J. G. Fichte, Discours ci la Nation Allemande (Paris, 1981)). This tacit link between the ideas of nation order and rationality may explain why Hegel chose to discuss law in the chapter on civil society and not in the chapter on the State as modern thinkers are inclined to do, Georg Hegel, Philosophy of Right, trans, and notes by T. M. Knox, (Oxford, 1952). The concept of nation was also linked in the minds of many of these thinkers to the myth of medieval Germanic freedoms. Furthermore, it took on deliberately anti-French connotations. None the less, it is never clear in the works of both Herder and Hegel why precisely the nation is the natural vehicle of human progress. There is a certain arbitrariness in the choice. Fichte strove to rectify this by placing emphasis on language in the constitution of the nation and in distinguishing between living and dead languages (French, of course, is dead). These ideas resurfaced again in the work Heidegger (see Martin Heidegger, An Introduction to Metaphysics (New Haven, 1959)).</page><page sequence="7">Idealist origins of the realist theory of international relations 391 thought of as a single individual, but only as living in a community as a part of the whole. This is his natural destiny. The abstract individual of English and French rationalism is a pure fiction in Fichte's eyes.20 It was left to Hegel, however, to elaborate on the uniqueness of the nation as the mediator between world history and the individual's own spiritual growth: 'the rational . . . assumes varying shapes; but in none of them is it more obviously an end than in that whereby the spirit explicates and manifests itself in the endlessly varying forms which we call nations . . . nations are the concepts which the spirit has formed itself'.21 Due to the vital role played by the nation in world-history, the goals of freedom, human realization and progress became associated with it. Hegel, Fichte and Herder thereafter argued that an enlightened individual should transfer his personal aspirations to the collective: sacrifice, bravery, obedience and altruism were regarded henceforth as the ultimate goals in life. 'The worth of individuals' argued Hegel 'is measured by the extent to which they reflect and represent the national spirit ... the individual's morality will then consist in fulfilling the duties imposed upon him by his social station.'22 In his eagerly attended 'Address to the German Nation',23 Fichte drew detailed plans of an educational programme which would instil in students these coveted qualities. The organic theory of the state provided a new framework within which the activities of the 'nation' in world politics would be understood. The nation, now seen as a sovereign political body, was depicted as a self-propelling social organization driven by an internal logic. Nations and states in international affairs For the idealists, the nation was first and foremost an ethical unity: the collective was seen as the natural repository of all individual aspirations. The 'organic' unity of the nation was postulated henceforth as a matter of fact. Ethical unity, however, was not see to resemble the interdependence of buyers and sellers in the market place: Because members of the nation participate in the creation of their moral and social essence their interdependence stretches to the very core of their being. The happiness of individuals is therefore reliant upon the success of the nation; and, conversely, should the collective falter, so in turn would individuals and societies become miserable and morally moribund as well. The systematization of social life within the lines of ontologically distinct units in effect placed the concept of the nation, as well as that of reason, at the heart of all legitimate forms of political interpretation. Given the amorphism of the nation, however, a second idea which resulted from these deliberations was the attribution to the state of a central role in relation both to civil society and the international 20 Bartholomew Landherr, 'The Universalistic Theory of Society of Othmar Spann and His School', in Harry Elmar Barnes (ed.), An Introduction to the History of Sociology (Chicago, 1948), p. 389. 21 Georg Hegel, Lectures on the Philosophy of World History: Introduction, trans.

Blair system.24 A small and marginal group in the German intellectual scene came in the early days of the nineteenth century to think of the state in altogether different terms. These were the romantics whose movement suggested something beyond even the strict limitations of reason; they likened the State to a work of art. With the romantics, all those ideas and hopes invested in the nation were transferred to the state or, at least in the case of Hegel, to the 'Idea of the State'. Soon, however, on the German intellectual scene, the state became inter changeable with the nation. The cultural, ethical and indeed spiritual qualities of the nation were now projected upon the edifice of the state. Hegel summarized one particular view when he stated that a nation consists on the one hand of distinct moment which combine to give it its general character; on the other, it also embodies the opposite principle of individuality, and these two principles together constitute the reality of the Idea. In a nation or state, everything depends on the nature of these two elements.25 It did not take long for contemporaries to grasp that such a conception of the nation-state would have profound implications for the study of international affairs: since the 'ethical state' was driven by anthropomorphic desires, the notion of personality or 'individuality' now found expression in history and international affairs. As Fichte observed, every nation strives to expand the unique good which it represents to the limits of possibility and to encompass within itself, insofar as it can, the whole of humanity. This is in accordance with a God-given impulse in man, causing that interrelationship of creative tensions upon which the community of peoples rests.26 The idealists, of course, knew very well that the 'striving' of nations to expand their 'unique good' and to encompass if possible the whole of humanity in practice would spell violence, war and brute force in all their possible manifestations?in short, the anarchical society which Hedley Bull has so well described. The significance of these developments in philosophy is that the struggle for power and prestige was no longer linked with the undemocratic behaviour of dynastic regimes, but was regarded as the natural behaviour of state-persons asserting their indivi duality. The state itself becomes, in other words, an 'actor' in its own right. A crucial inversion took place, with the tentative, implicit but ever present effect of the domestic structure of the state (specifically, the nature of its regime) on international affairs, giving way to a situation when the international arena does seem to have an effect upon the rather more pliable domestic politics. Domestic society was becoming marginalized in the study of international affairs. 24 Hegel recognized that the nation itself was not an operative entity: 'world history', he asserts, 'takes account only of nations that constituted themselves into states.' Hegel, Philosophy and World History, p. 95. For Hegel, the development of a state out of the ethical community of the nation is part of the process of gaining self-consciousness insofar as the nation objectifies itself in a rational system of laws and institutions. The state is not merely a protective shield for the nation, but it is rather the system of social relations which allows the nation to realize itself in history. The nation may therefore be the underlying social organization of human life. But this remains an unfulfilled potential unless it is organized in a state. 25 Hegel, Philosophy of Right, p. 76. 26 Fichte, Discourse ? la Nation p. 83.</page><page sequence="9">Idealist origins of the realist theory of international relations 393 Early idealist concept of the international system Hegel recognized this much. At the same time he also strove to demonstrate that competition between states had a ideological and beneficial effect on the internal constitution of the state. In the Hegelian system, the state represents a particular moment in the development of world spirit. At this juncture the state is universal ized on the stage of world history by providing a more coherent and rational ordering of society. Following Herder, Hegel held that the philosophy of history teaches us that the struggle between states transcends the small world of egoistic states: 'War is not to be regarded as an absolute evil and as a purely external accident . . . Here as elsewhere, the point of view from which things seem pure accidents vanishes if we look at them in the light of the concept and philosophy'.27 Hegel pointed out that competition between states resulted in better organized, more rational societies. Competition and rivalry between states provided a practical yardstick by which societies measured?or were forced to measure?the level of their own internal coherence. Competition between states should not be seen therefore in terms of a purely anarchic struggle between states, but should be understood in a wider dimension: acting in the service of reason and the creation of universal history. Thus, Hegel saw the collapse of the Hellenic, Roman and the Holy Roman empires as evidence that their specific modes of social organization had become outmoded.28 For Hegel, therefore, competition between states could not usefully be seen in terms of a separate international system. On the contrary, international affairs could only be grasped fully by taking into consideration the totality of social life. For Hegel, in other words, there could not be a separate theory of international affairs. Abstracting the international as a separate system would lend one to believe that international affairs is the realm of accidental and chaotic relations between states. The dominance of one society over the other would be the result of mere 'might' and not reason. Early idealism, it appears, was caught up in its own contradictions, establishing the idea of the state as an 'actor' in world politics, while denying the logical implications of the resulting theoretical framework. Early idealists resisted the more cynical, Machiavellian tendencies dominating later realist thought on the grounds that a 'realistic' assessment of the role and function of state rivalry in history must take account of the wider historical dimension. Modern realism amounts, in many senses, to idealism minus the concept of history, teleology and change. As Halliday observes, (modern) realism is profoundly a-historical.29 The vulgarization of the organic theory of the state Hegel's theory of the state did not lead necessarily to a realist interpretation. On 27 Hegel, Philosophy of Right, p. 209. 28 Hegel was thinking about the experience of Napoleon, the experience of seeing a mass society mobilized in a rational manner before which the archaic regimes of Europe simply crumbled. Hegel saw the potential positive effects of the French conquest in dissolving the old Germanic system, and furthermore, and this was sweet music to German ears, he foresaw that the rationalization of the German state based upon liberal principles would represent a more formidable political format for the development of the German people. 29 Fred Halliday, 'Theorizing the International', Economy &amp; Society, 18 (1989).</page><page sequence="10">394 Ronen P. Palan and Brook M. Blair the contrary, as we have seen, Hegel appears to resist reaching the logical conclusions of his own thoughts. Hegel had a very clear conception of the systemic pressures exerted in a 'system of states'. However, he was still attached to the idea that reason was at work behind the apparent randomness of all conflict. He seems to have been systematizing a particular thought-process which doubtless goes back to Herder and Fichte. Herder, for instance, viewed the emergence of a 'system of states' (which he attributes to the French) with ironic disdain. The system of states creates uniformity and subservience, thwarting the development of individual cultures: Balance of Europe, thou magnificent invention, totally unknown to previous ages! Friction there might still be among our great political bodies?in which mankind is undoubtedly so much better cared for?mutual destruction, however or even the possibility thereof, is now ruled out ... In their noble and majestic progress our political monsters swallow up all the tiny insects that get into their paths and in return create for us uniformity, order and security . . . Hail to the balance of Europe! Hail to the eternal peace, order, security and obedience in Europe.30 Fichte too maintained that a government which is dominated by egoism neglects its duties to maintain security for the nation.31 These early idealists always pointed out that conflict could be beneficial at times. Another strain associated in different ways with Goethe, Schopenhaur, Burkhardt and Nietzsche, was entirely sceptical of this new fascination with the state and above all with its tendency towards idealization. Burkhardt mocks the Hegelian notion that '[t]he great state exists in history for the achievement of great external aims, for the maintenance and protection of certain cultures which would founder without it'. In latter day Europe, he asserts, Utterly regardless of all religion, the privilege of egoism, which is denied to the individual is bestowed on the state. Weaker neighbours are subjected and annexed, or in some way deprived of their interdependence, not in order to forestall hostilities on their part, for that hardly consists of a thought, but to prevent another taking them and turning them to its own political ends, and once on that road, there is no stopping, there is an excuse for everything . . . The next step is that things are done in advance, without any real motive, on the principle: Tf we take it in time, we shall avert the danger of war in the future'. Ultimately a permanent appetite for territorial 'rounding off is created, which devours whatever happens to lie convenient and can be laid hands on.32 In modern realism one find the two strands of thought totally confused. On the one hand, there is a celebration if not outright reification of the state (for example in Krasner's work the state pursues its 'national interest' and in Gilpin's, the state is responsible for security and welfare).33 On the other hand, modern realists seem continually to reiterate that the international system is based upon little more than power politics. The resulting incoherence is not the product of the typical canon of realist theory, for example Machiavelli and Hobbes, but rather as we have seen, the effects of the idealist tradition of the early nineteenth century. 30 Herder, Social and Political Culture, p. 207 31 Fichte, Discourse ? la Nation, p. 67. 32 Jacob Burkhardt, Reflection on History (Indianapolis, 1979), pp. 67-8. 33 See Robert Gilpin, War &amp; Change in World Politics (Cambridge, 1981) and Stephen D.

One idea, however, seems to have permeated the dominant discussion of German political theory, and that is, that the state has a personality of its own, and that this personality explains domestic and foreign politics. Although in this paper we have made reference to Hegel, it was in fact the crude conception of this organic unity which was to captivate the German national audience. Early idealists arrived at the notion of the individual and unique nation to describe the relations between individuals and society while devoting but few remarks to the actual nature of the international system. Later thinkers, however, did turn their attention more directly towards international relations. The link between the realism and idealism is somewhat obscured because of the circuitous route which the development of the concept of the state has taken in political theory since that time. In many respects, Hegel's ideas may be said to have reached mainstream international relations theory by means of the historical juridical school which held that the state possessed a juristic personality. The juristic school marked a new way of thinking about the problem of sovereignty. The starting point of earlier juridical schools of thought was an image of the state in terms of power. Thus sovereignty was thought to reside in specific agencies of government. The juristic school denied this line of reasoning and recognized that the powers exercised by governments vary from time and place, that the agencies in which government is organised are matters of historical circumstances and therefore from the point of view of logic largely accidental . . . The study of political organisations is therefore empirical through and through . . . This empirical study, however, is controlled by the intellectual necessity of assuming the unity of the subject of the study. The state therefore must be conceived as a unity, this unity being, as Jellinek says 'a form of synthesis necessarily imposed upon us by our consciousness' it points toward a unity behind the empirical agencies of government. This is the state itself, a collective person, to which alone ultimate authority belongs and whose being consists solely in the fact that it is the repository of political and legal authority.34 One member of the historical-juridical school, Labland went yet further, arguing that [f]rom the conception of the State as a juristic person in the eye of public law, it follows that the possessor of the state's authority is the State itself.35 Possibly, this was the first instance that an acknowledged abstract entity was presumed to possess a concrete political will. In fact, with Labland, political thinkers were no longer discussing the 'Idea' of the state but rather referring to the actual state itself. Paralleling that, around the middle of the nineteenth century the debate was removed from the philosophy of history and shifted to a matter for political science, and consequently the organic theory of the state was adopted as a staple of political analysis. From the juristic theory it was a small step towards the conception of the state as a person. Bluntschili, an influential thinker at the time but largely forgotten today, is a typical example. 'The State', he declares 'is in no way a lifeless instrument, a dead machine: it is a living and therefore organised being.'36 If one 34 George H. Sabin, and Walter J.

Blair should wonder precisely why the state would seek power and prestige in foreign affairs, Bluntschili had a firm answer: 'To extend the reputation and the power of the State, to further its welfare and its happiness, has universally been regarded as one of the most honourable duties of gifted men'.37 The progression of this logic is nowhere more evident than in Heinrich von Treitschke's political philosophy. In Treitschke's work, the philosophy of history is no longer required to explain power politics: on the contrary, the state itself, its very personality, is a sufficient justification. Treat the State as a person, and the necessary and rational multiplicity of states follows . . . Just as in individual life the ego implies the existence of the non-ego, so it does in State. The State is power, precisely in order to assert itself as against other equally independent powers. War and the administration of justice are the chief tasks of even the most barbaric states.38 Although adopting a somewhat more refined language, Meinecke expressed similar ideas: the well-being of the State and of its population is held to be the ultimate value and the goal; and power, maintenance of power, extension of power, is the indispensable means which must?without any qualification?be procured . . . [thus] power belongs to the essence of the State; without it the State cannot carry out its task of upholding justice and protecting the community.39 With Treitschke and Meinecke we have reached the end of the nineteenth century. Although the language of these writers would lead us to believe that they are still part of the idealist tradition, it is clear that there are significant changes both in the nature of their theoretical discussion and in the character of the epoch itself. Nonetheless, the passages cited above do suggest a certain continuity in the organic theory of the state as well as the way it reflects on international relations. For such theory not only attributes an inherent will to the state, it also stipulates the subordination of internal strife to this will. It is therefore the unspoken assumption shared by realists that international politics impose strict limitations upon the domestic play of forces. Since the precise mechanism by which the aims of the state over-ride group interests, the latter have so far eluded theoretical analysis; the claim for the primacy of external politics over the domestic political process had to rest principally upon normative considerations. It is thought that the state would be able to play down parochial interests and thus maintain homoeostasis because individuals are able to see in it a higher ideal. This is the essence of Meinecke's contention in the quote cited above, and it is reiterated by Hans Morgenthau. The Protection of the nation against destruction from without and disruption from within is the over-riding concern of all citizens. Likewise, loyalty to the nation is a paramount commitment of all citizens . . . nothing can be tolerated that might threaten the coherence of the nation. Interests, ideas, and loyalties which might not be compatible with the concern for the unity of the nation must yield to that concern . . . This concern imposes an ever present limitation upon the kind of issues which will be allowed to separate A and B.40 37 Bluntschili, Theory of the State, p.22 38 Heinrich von Treitschke, Politics (London, 1916), p. 19. 39 Meinecke, Cosmopolitan, p. 1. 40 Morgenthau, Politics Among Nations, p. 486.</page><page sequence="13">Idealist origins of the realist theory of international relations 397 Hedley Bull, however, must be credited with the ultimate organic metaphor. According to Bull, not only are states persons but international politics is principally concerned with the survival of the species: What, for example, are the goals of the system of states, he asks? 'First, there is the goal of preservation of the system and society of states itself . . . The society of states has sought to ensure that it will remain the prevailing form of universal political organization, in fact and in right'.41 Idealism and postwar realism In modern texts of International Relations one finds little or no mention of nineteenth century idealism. The theory is invariably credited to Machiavelli, Hobbes or Rousseau and is supposed to have laid in the doldrums until the end of the Second World War. This gap in the semi-official historiography of international relations amounts to a denial of the political and normative connotations of realist thought. It is not very difficult to see the reason why modern realists have neglected a large and significant chunk of their intellectual heritage. As Hobhouse, one of those branded contemptuously and incorrectly by E. H. Carr as an idealist, states: Hegel's divine State, Treitschke's power, Nietzsche's contempt of restraint are fused together in the faith which animates the governing classes of Germany, political and military and academic?fused in the medium of some misty conception of the progress of mankind through competition and the fated superiority of the German race.42 Political realism and power politics were associated with the violence and aggres sive foreign policy of Germany during the two World Wars and therefore served no purpose for modern realists. There was also the matter of the circuitous route by which the idealist theory reached mainstream international relations. There are also admittedly different interpretations of idealism and realism. The Fascist social philosopher, Otto Spahn, who clearly belongs to the nationalist-idealist camp, saw both Hobbes and Machiavelli as belonging to the opposing 'individualistic' camp.43 Modern realism is quite obviously not the mere product of idealist thought. Nonetheless, in neglecting the past, postwar realists have conjured up an eclectic theory which goes against most of the findings and assertions of modern political science. In contrast to modern realism, the idealist theory of the state achieved a comprehensive treatment in international relations and united it with a theory of 'human nature', of the state and of history. The key concept was the 'personality' or the 'individuality' of the State, and as we have seen, the concept of the personality had a clear theoretical basis and was far more than a mere charac terization of the 'natural' interest of the state. But what is the 'individuality' of the state if not the modern idea of power divested, magically as it were, from its world-historical connotations? To Hegel, the state perfects itself through external struggles, and struggle is in itself a universalizing moment in world-history.

Blair postwar realists, by contrast, whatever takes place within the territorial boundaries of the state is considered 'domestic polities'; in other words, they have accepted the materialistic (i.e., liberal) idea 'that all life is a pattern of interaction among social groups and individuals and that one aspect of this interaction relates to specifically political matters',44 but they have maintained at the same time the international dimension of the idealist theory. Postwar realists retain only the idea of com petition and balance of power between states, but they lack the theoretical profundity which allowed early idealists/realists to form deeper insights into the significance of competition between states. As a result, international politics appears in this light as an autonomous and tragic realm of self-propelled unities working their way laboriously towards extinction. There is neither evolutionary development nor history in the system, only the fatal binary option: either the system exists by means of controlled violence or it ceases to exist. Postwar realists therefore make a virtue of what they claim to be a necessity: the balance of power of the status quo. Conclusion There is a vast and unacknowledged history of thought from which postwar realism has drawn. And it would appear furthermore that the common tendency to locate the origins of realist theory in the works of Thucydides, Machiavelli and Hobbes affords us little more than a partial perspective on the modern tradition of the state-centric approach to international relations. For beyond identifying the duality separating sovereign order from anarchy, strife and war, it would seem that modern theories of the state had long-since developed a far more complex notion of sovereignty hinging upon the state-society relationship itself, a configuration which postwar realists have never given any degree of serious consideration. We shall not speculate why realism has marginalized these questions. Yet this much does seem clear: while the thinkers of the early nineteenth century?as well as those who followed in their wake?were deeply involved with the problematic nature of sovereignty within the state-society relationship and sought to develop their enquiries along rational grounds, realists have tacitly accepted this relation ship as a given. For theorists such as Northedge, Morgenthau and Bull, the notion of the state having an autonomous will of its own?a uniquely idealist assertion?is simply taken for granted with no concern whatsoever for establishing its legitimate foundations, a matter which deeply engaged and indeed informed the entire development of earlier state-centric thought. On the contrary, it would seem that realism has sought to assume the unity of the state-society relationship merely in order to re-assert the Hobbesian system of sovereign states, impermeable to one another and based upon firm hierarchies of power. For international relations, such a theoretical oversight has several implications which are coming into sharper relief as the discipline begins to draw upon the insights of other fields of study. In effect, what is required is a return to the 44 David Easton, The Political System (Chicago and London, 1953), p. 160.</page><page sequence="15">Idealist origins of the realist theory of international relations 399 questions which so obsessed the early theorists of the nation-state and which, without ever being fully worked-out, were simply swept to the side by the predominating views of postwar realism. Hence, one must attempt once again to systematically define the forces which are exerted upon the state, both internally and externally, as well as within the sovereign apparatus itself. A rigorous move in this direction would allow theorists to clarify the precise nature of the political processes by which the state is composed and also the international context in which the state must exist. For it is precisely these forces which postwar realist thought has unfortunately neglected and which, in a period such as our own, can no longer be denied.</page></plain_text>
