<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 601 P. CARTLEDGE: The Greeks. A Portrait of Self and Others (Opus). Pp. xvi + 234. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997 (first published 1993). Paper, ?8.99. ISBN: 0-19-289147-2. This revised edition updates bibliography, but still carries a 1993 publication date and essentially remains the volume which ought to have been reviewed when it first appeared-mea maxima culpa. (They have not even changed the statement [p. 46] that Cunaxa is near Nineveh-a display of positively Hellenic disdain for the distinction between Assyria and Babylonia.) C. aims 'to interpret and understand the mindset or mentality of the Greeks, the underlying and often unconscious spiritual and cultural mechanisms that made them "tick"'-and to 'defamilarize Classical Greek civilization': for he feels a conflict between the Greek roots of our intellectual, civic, and cultural values and certain alien features in their outlook on the world. For these purposes the alien does not consist of the antiquarian bric-a-brac of social behaviour in which no self-respecting historical anthropologist should get enmeshed. What worries C. is that Greeks were nasty to foreigners, women, and outsiders, owned slaves, and had a polytheistic, anthropomorphic religious system which prompted weak-minded brethren (e.g. Xenophon) to attribute excessive importance to the influence of gods on human affairs. Greek religion is certainly a rum business, but C. does not bring this out as strongly as one might: he describes the contrast with Christianity, but does not try to conjure up the alien quality of its constituents (e.g. blood-sacrifice) and evinces little empathetic engagement with religious sensibility, ancient or modern: gods are things to think with, and any Greek oddity consists in the way they did that thinking-even, one suspects, in their doing it all. If this suspicion is justified, it devalues Greek 'otherness' here-modern humanist irreligiosity is historically the exception, so it is those who espouse it who are out of step and have forfeited the chance to comment on the undoubted gap between the Victorian in the pew and the classical man in the temenos. At any rate, this chapter is perhaps the least successful (and C. is simply insensitive in his interpretation of Xenophon). Being nasty to foreigners, women, and outsiders, by contrast, is something the modern world continues to be good at. But, in precisely those societies most likely to acknowledge Hellenic roots, it is anathema to admit it. That gives C. a better-if perfectly familiar-handle to get a hold of, and he parades the usual suspects with elegance and wit. There are limitations. (1) The time-frame is strictly 500-300: fair enough, but the title is misleading. (2) C. cites G. E. R. Lloyd ('to study what passes for science in a society is to go to the centre of the values of that society') but does not much follow the suggestion. (3) The main sources are Aristotle, Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenophon. The virtual absence of Aristophanes is paradoxical and, if nothing else, reduces the gaiety of the discourse. (4) Speaking of gaiety, apart from the odd, sometimes gratuitous, references to buggery, homosexuality is glaringly absent. I cannot believe this is because C. thinks it an area of straightforward continuity between then and now. Of course, PC-wise it is (or was in 1993) still a trickier topic than women or foreigners. (5) The cover-blurb hails C.'s awareness of theoretical issues. But C.'s bark has always been more alarming than his bite: he remains the product of empirical Anglo-Saxon training, and there is little to frighten the horses, despite his passion for Hartog's Mirror of Herodotus (and he does concede it is overlong). (6) Linear argument is rather elusive throughout. For example, Chapter V asks whether politics really was unusually central for Greeks, reaches an interim positive conclusion, and continues 'And yet, and yet. . .' as though about to enter a caveat. But what follows discusses citizenship qualifications, stasis, and the Athenian epitaphios- important matters, but none of them obviously substantively qualifies the interim conclusion. The chapter on slavery is a similar case of dianoia eiromene. (C. claims, incidentally, that Hdt. 4.1-4 enshrines pre-Aristotelian 'natural slave' thinking; but since the slaves involved are the children of slaves, they are liable to be regarded as inferior even by those who did not have a theory of the 'natural slave'. Still, since Aristotle's thesis is so ludicrously bogus-C. is not as rude about this as he should be-perhaps it hardly matters.) This is a book where the immediate vignette and the eventual sense of having been immersed in a view rather than driven towards it win out over logical analysis. But no matter: the experience is pleasurable, and any student who reads it closely, taking care to understand all its hints and allusions, will learn a lot.
