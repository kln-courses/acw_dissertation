KEY WORDS: work inhibition; psychodynamic group therapy. Work Inhibition (WI), broadly defined, is the inability to pursue one's career goals or work tasks with an optimal degree of effort, interest, col- legiality, creativity and persistence. Related to this inhibition is a restricted ability to raise problems with key supervisors. Problems arise, but the worker cannot clearly define them nor communicate what is wrong. Either the worker does not know how, or expects an unsympathetic response from others. While psychodynamic group therapy has not been frequently seen as a medium for resolving career crises, counseling psychology, in contrast, has long used time-limited, thematic groups extensively for helping clients with work problems. A recent review of the counseling psychology literature by Kivlighan (1990) notes sparse reference to the group process factors that contribute to work improvement. He concludes: "A much bleaker pic- ture emerges when one looks at the group process variables that have been empirically examined in the career counseling literature .... Even when such factors as interpersonal learning and self-disclosure have been emphasized, 1La Guardia Community College, City University of New York, Long Island City, New York.

Kivlighan calls for more intensive study of not just the traditional curative factors (Yalom, 1985) but also of group composition, therapist effect and group developmental issues. The purpose of this paper is to describe how combined individual and group psychodynamic psychotherapy can treat WI. Symptoms of WI will be reported, a psychodynamic formulation of the problem will be presented and clinical strategies incorporating group treatment and illustrations of them will be provided. The specific ways in which psychotherapy addresses significant work problems should be of interest to leaders of general psychodynamic groups as well as to colleagues using the group modality more explicitly with clients facing job crises. SYMPTOMS OF WORK INHIBITION Kernberg (1989) has written sensitively about the relationship between work-related problems arising in middle age and character pathology: "Character problems may have caused failure in important professional functions, or severe work inhibition may have interfered with expectable promotions. In the course of the evaluation, I raise questions about the relations between achievements and aspirations and the extent to which previous aspirations have been suppressed by a sense of impotence and hopelessness" (pp. 210-211). It is this feeling of impotence and hopelessness that characterizes the patients entering treatment for help with WI. In assessing patients for WI, I engage the patient in a discussion of his or her career history. I want to know about changes in interest levels, performance and evaluations. I also note the difficulty the patient has in providing me with full, rich answers. For example, a vague reply that he or she is "bored" or "fed-up" or "trapped" or "burned out" with few details or illustrations would suggest inhibition and related interpersonal problems in attending to them. I try to determine the extent to which shifts in the patient's work life are the result of an impaired capacity to regulate self- esteem. This deficit in regulation contributes to feelings of hopelessness and impotence when the worker experiences disappointment. In Table I, I have listed many concrete signs of WI. This extensive set of problems should help the group therapist to collect data about the de- gree of WI. After such a determination is made the therapist needs to explore the extent to which problems in self-esteem regulation have con- tributed to WI. Work-related self-esteem regulation, in my view, is linked</page><page sequence="3">Treating Work Inhibition 289 to earlier difficulties in acquiring a realistic and flexible ideal self. A clinical plan of combined group and individual treatment is suggested to modify the ideal self and build the patient's capacity to regulate self-esteem in the workplace. PSYCHODYNAMIC FORMULATION OF WI My exploration of the developmental histories of patients suffering from WI leads me to suggest the WI stems from derailed development of the ideal self, a reformulation of the construct ego ideal. That impaired ideal self results in problems in self-esteem regulation within the work ex- perience and may contribute to work inhibition. When he examines questions of personal achievement, Schafer (1992) prefers the term "ideal self" to the construct "ego ideal." "Success and failure," he writes, "cannot be discussed psychoanalytically without consid- ering [the ego ideal]. However ... I prefer to speak of the ideal self rather Table I.

Traditionally, the ego ideal has been tied too closely to superego theory, and so it does not adequately take into account the primitive wishful, defensive, and adaptive aspects of ideal formation along with its archaic moral aspects- that is, its id and ego aspects along with its superego aspects" (p. 103). Schafer suggests that the ideal self is a guide for activity and presumably work activity as well. It would be useful to examine ways in which the ideal self serves wish- ful, defensive and adaptive functions in the workplace that could result in WI. Wishful Aspects of the Ideal Self at Work Wishes regarding career consist of goals and ambitions, both of which can be tied to the ideal self. Kohut (1986) writes: "At the risk of sounding anthropomorphic, yet in reality only condensing a host of clinical impressions and genetic recon- structions, I am tempted to say that the ego experiences the influence of the ego ideal as coming from above and the narcissistic self as coming from below. Or I might illustrate my point by the use of imagery which pertains to the preconscious derivatives of the two structures and say that man is led by his ideals but pushed by his ambitions. And in contrast to the ide- alized parent imago which is gazed at in awe, admired, looked up to, and like which one wants to become, the narcissistic self wants to be looked at and admired" (p. 67). The wish to live up to parental goals may propel the self-at-work to- ward vocational goals, but threats to reaching them may culminate in rapid declines in self-esteem and lead to symptoms of WI. Defensive Aspects of the Ideal Self at Work The ideal self is constructed from idealized qualities of parents and values of the family and society. The function of such an incorporation may be defensive in that it enables the infant to deny his or her own limi- tations. Annie Reich (1986) describes how the infant incorporates idealized images of parents into the ideal self as the child recognizes personal defi- ciencies. She writes: "As his sense of reality grows, the child, recognizing his own weakness, endows his parents with the omnipotence he has had to forego. From this time on, desires set in to become like a glorified par- ent. The deep longing to become like the parent creates a constant inner demand upon the child's ego: an ego ideal is formed. In cases of insufficient</page><page sequence="5">Treating Work Inhibition 291 acceptance of reality the differentiation between ego and ego ideal may remain diffuse, and under certain conditions magic identification with their glorified parent- megalomaniac feelings- may replace the wish to be like him (p. 303). The infant denies personal and parental limitations. The ego ideal reflects this denial as the child attempts to identify with the ide- alized parent and regain a feeling of perfection. Kohut (1986) adds that the ideal self results from "the phase specific, massive introjection of the idealized qualities of the object. The fact that the idealized parent was the carrier of the originally narcissistic perfection and omnipotence accounts now for the omnipotence, omniscience, and per- fection of the superego, and it is due to these circumstances that the values and standards of the superego are experienced as absolute" (p. 66). This acquisition of the idealized self and other objects enables the child to deny the anxiety associated with the realistic perceptions of him- or her- self and his or her inevitable disappointment with parents. At the work- place, failure to live up to idealized standards can further result in feelings of depletion at work and to WI. Adaptive Aspects of the Ideal Self in the Workplace Kernberg (1975) discusses how healthy development of the ideal self sustains the individual despite frustrations and setbacks. He writes: "Nor- mally, idealized images of the parental figures and idealized self images are first condensed into the ego ideal, which is then further modified by the integration and incorporation of more realistically perceived parental demands, of the sadistic forerunners of the superego, and of the more ad- vanced aspects of the prohibitive superego. Such a 'toned down,' less gran- diose, and more attainable ego ideal permits one the normal narcissistic gratification of living up to the internalized ideal parental images, and this gratification in turn reinforces self-esteem, one's confidence in one's own goodness and one's trust in gratifying object relationships" (p. 240). Kohut (1986) further explains the process by which the ideal self pro- tects self-esteem: "Our ideals are our internal leaders; we love them and are longing to reach them. Ideals are capable of absorbing a great deal of transformed narcissistic libido and thus of diminishing narcissistic tensions and narcissistic vulnerability" (p. 68). For some, early circumstances block the ideal self from normal devel- opment and lead to continuous threats to self-esteem. According to Jacob- son (1964) narcissistic parental attitudes prevent the child's normal individuation. She notes: "... Contradictory ... attitudes, which created con- fusions in the area of values, may have caused problems in the development and integration of these patients' personal and group relations and iden-</page><page sequence="6">292 Kleinberg tifications .... In some patients of this kind, their ambitiousness may acquire a painful driving and obsessional superego quality, and be so structurally intertwined with moral perfectionism that they suffer from superego fears as much as from social fears; and not only moral failures, but failures in any sphere will evoke in them a harassing mixture of guilt with inferiority feelings and shame reactions .... Such patients commonly display severely masochistic-dependent trends and a predisposition to depressive states which may alternate with or be covered up by aggressive narcissistic be- havior" (pp. 204-5). Depressive moods and aggressive behavior aimed at protecting the de- pleted self will inevitably cause problems at work. When self-esteem regu- lation is impaired, setbacks and anticipated failure to live up to one's ideals, could take the form of WI. HOW THE GROUP CAN MODIFY THE IDEAL SELF Erikson (1968) holds the view that whereas the superego is seen as "more archaic, more thoroughly internalized and more unconscious repre- sentative of man's inborn proclivity toward the development of a primitive, categorical conscience," the ideal self is more accessible to modification. He sees ideals as less blindly followed, more bound to social reality and "closer to the ego function of reality testing" (p. 210). The ideal self has a group aspect in that its constituents relate to a family, a class or a nation. When ideals are not fulfilled, a sense of guilt arises. "Originally," writes Freud (1914), "this sense of guilt was a fear of punishment by the parents, or, more correctly, the fear of losing their love; later the parents are replaced by an infinite number of fellow-men." The social environment may have failed to support the child's ideals. Schafer (1967) describes such an environment as "empty or defective" (p. 163). In addition, the child's capacity to conduct a "creative search" of the environment for an appropriate setting may be hindered by previous de- velopmental blocks. All the conditions then are ripe for a pervasive failure to achieve ideals. Schafer states that the child "may arbitrarily try to force the invention [of an ideal] to work. He may do so by intensifying his gran- diose narcissistic fantasies and/or by blatant projection of the overblown ideal onto his parents." The result is that "the distance between his deeply experienced self and his ideal self or his ideal object will then be too great to be filled by satisfying experience" (p. 164). Conceptually, a corrective group experience would modify the ideal self by understanding and working through its wishful and defensive aspects and by strengthening its role in adaptation.</page><page sequence="7">Treating Work Inhibition 293 Group treatment can evoke wishes, defenses and expectations that originated in childhood and may have reemerged in the workplace. Since family and societal pressures have influenced the development of the de- fective ideal self, group treatment- more so than individual therapy, alone- can become the laboratory for resolving work inhibition. Unrealistic wishes and defenses linked to the ideal self appear in the patient's transferences to the therapist and to other members of the group. Schafer (1967) states: "Patients revive ... primitive ideal objects in their transferences .... At bottom it is not only that the patient needs the analyst to be perfect for his own narcissistic reasons- to be the protecting and loving mother and father, and someone on whom it is safe to depend be- cause he is protected by idealization from the patient's own hostile acts and devaluations. The patient also revives an old piece of psychic reality- an ideal person who actually existed, who could do anything and know everything, who was a giant and a wizard, and yet a person who has no place in conscious, organized memory. I emphasized ... the ideals the child creates on the strength of his wishes. Here I emphasize the subjective ex- perience on primitive levels of psychic development that is used in elabo- rating these ideals and also tends to confirm them" (p. 169). The need for the therapist and others in the group to be perfect- some of whom may actually activate the need for an idealized object more so than does the therapist- may mirror the excessive narcissistic demands that are experienced on the job. Understanding and working through these de- mands in the group may help to revise WI patterns that affect relationships with supervisors. HOW GROUP CORRECTS PATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE IDEAL SELF There are three types of primitive transferences related to the ideal self that emerge in psychodynamic group treatment: transferences to the therapist, to the other members, and to the group-as-a-whole. Transference to the Therapist Reactivated in the group are demands that the therapist be all-knowing and all-powerful. Through magical-thinking that once characterized the in- fant, the adult patient attempts to compensate for either his or her own realization of profound dependency or for the growing disillusionment with the therapist. The notion that the world is increasingly dangerous because</page><page sequence="8">294 Kleinberg the self or the caregiver cannot provide the protection once thought pos- sible sets off overwhelming anxiety and immediate defenses to manage it. For most patients, entry into group reactivates that sense of smallness and vulnerability. Demanding that the group leader fulfill the ideal selfs need for a powerful protector is an early sign of transference to the leader. Not surprisingly, patients who develop this transference soon after group entry are likely to have experienced his or her on-the-job supervisor in a similar manner. For example, Ron's expectation that his immediate boss would "bring him along," serve as his role model, and prevent com- petitors from causing harm both allowed Ron to begin work with manage- able anxiety and set the stage for a work crisis later on. This transference to the supervisor, later seen in the relationship to the therapist, was as strong as it was, because of an ideal self that much earlier needed to impose a model of perfection. This perfectionistic ideal self reflected Ron's need to compensate for a charismatic father who ultimately failed to provide him with what he developmentally needed. That this transference emerged more clearly in group than in the prior individual phase of treatment underscores how much of the interpersonal conflict with his father occurred while the family watched. The family's par- ticipation in this pattern reinforced both the father's inflated view of him- self and Ron's powerlessness. Transference to the Other Members Group provides the opportunity for multiple transferences and par- ticularly those related to siblings. Rivalry among brothers and sisters for some can play a role in a child's life almost equal to that played by parents. When the child attempts to deal with unrealistic standards arising from the ideal self, rivalry can take many forms, including intimidation and seduc- tion. Many patients suffering from WI report conflict with peers. Inability to compete, cooperate or lead in the work group may stem from declining self-esteem when faced with unrealistic demands from the ideal self. If the individual assumes that ideal self standards cannot be achieved, he or she is likely to avoid advancement and feel alienated from those who accept more demanding assignments. Ron refused to take on any new responsibilities. Despite intelligence and creativity, he would be "too busy with other things" when asked by his employer to take charge of this task force or that new project. Instead, he would remain a follower, but behind their backs would criticize col- leagues who had assumed higher levels of responsibility. He would become</page><page sequence="9">Treating Work Inhibition 295 cynical and his attitudes and behavior often interfered with the accomplish- ment of the assigned group task. Ron's cynicism about his associates emerged in group in a way that could only be talked about in the prior individual treatment. For example, when Sally initiated a discussion of a new topic, Ron would occasionally ask: "Why do we need to discuss this? What's the point? How will this help? Didn't Sally talk about this six months ago and what progress did she make then?" His comments deflated Sally's hope. As it turned out, Ron's response to Sally replicated his earlier rela- tionship with his sister. Their parents seemed to have promoted this sibling rivalry as each child strove to get their approval. It must have seemed that there was not enough love available for both children. Ron belittled his sister whenever he could. Transference to the Group-As-A-Whole The patient's attitude about and behavior within the work organization can produce WI. Terms such as "morale," "team spirit," and "team player" underscore how valued and valuable is one's allegiance to the company. As the worker becomes alienated from the employer, his or her motivation and performance will decline- a negative trend that cannot be hidden for long. As it is noticed by others, the worker receives negative responses thus deepening workplace problems, including WI. The group-as-a-whole transference may originate in a family that could not provide the child with realistic role models or a climate that permitted failure. After two years at work, Ron began to feel let down by his supervisor and increasingly felt that his firm was not living up to its strong reputation. Ron began to "tell tales out of school." At social gatherings he would gossip about how "screwed up" the company was. In the company dining area, he would "get a kick" from describing how yet another project failed. In the therapy group, Ron increasingly reported how he had compared his group with those of his friends and concluded that theirs were better. He debated with fellow members when they said that they thought that "our" group was helpful. Ron was clearly not being a team player. Ron's parents had insisted that the children maintain a public image of the Ail-American Family. What could not be revealed were the severe family problems that were evident to members inside the home. The par- ents held prominent positions within the community and a facade had to be maintained at all cost. Ron and his sister managed to get into trouble in school- their way of dealing with their own internal conflicts- while at the same time keeping focus away from what was going on at home.</page><page sequence="10">296 Kleinberg THE DISINHIBITING PROCESS IN GROUP The patient suffering from WI will invariably act in an inhibited way in group therapy. The individual will be experienced as not working in the group process. The treatment then becomes a laboratory for identifying, understanding and working through the inhibited state in group. The pa- tient will then modify the ideal self and be better able to work. Connelly &amp; Piper (1989) define work behavior in group as "the extent to which a patient discussed problems, attempted to find solutions, gave feedback, and made interpretations" (pp. 174-175). Using Connelly &amp; Piper's (1989) approaches to assessing work behav- ior, I evaluated Ron's initial level of participation in group treatment as low. He had difficulty in engaging in "therapeutically relevant tasks such as discussion of here-and-now thoughts and feelings and investment in pri- vate material" (p. 174). Work behavior in group treatment has been significantly correlated with positive clinical outcomes (e.g., Piper, Joyce, Rosie, &amp; Azim, 1994). Therefore in preparing my treatment goals, I hypothesized that if Ron, in group, could become more reflective, communicative and interactive, his work inhibition in his career would be reduced. Piper, Joyce, Rosie, &amp; Azim (1994) offer possible explanations for the relationship between work behavior and positive treatment results. For ex- ample, consistent with Yalom's (1985) list of curative factors, a patient may identify with other patients engaged in the group, may learn from the feed- back from other members, feel hopeful, see that he or she is not alone with psychological problems, etc. Through this process the patient observes more realistic and flexible models for subsequent incorporation into the ideal self. In formulating my treatment strategies, I hoped that Ron would learn from other members who were able to use the group modality to explore their dynamics. While the other patients expressed frustration with Ron's difficulty in "becoming involved in the group," they did not become angry at him. I helped them understand the adaptive value of his work inhibition in the context of his family history (see Kleinberg, 1995). Through much discussion, Ron began to understand that their frustration reflected, in part, their concern for him (see Kleinberg, 1991). Once a climate of relative safety and support was established, Ron felt less pressured and vulnerable and more able to incorporate the work attitudes and behaviors of the less work-inhibited members. Six months later, Ron was able to express disappointment- without cynicism- in other members and in the leader for the slow progress he was making. The group received these criticisms with interest and a desire to explore what was</page><page sequence="11">Treating Work Inhibition 297 behind them. Ron's cynicism about therapy was replaced by more open and specific observations of the limitations of treatment. In his job, Ron began to be more expressive with his supervisor and his peers. When he felt ignored, used or unappreciated he made tentative moves to openly discussing these grievances. The more he was able to ex- press himself, the less he needed to be seen as the angry young man. Much to his surprise, he found that some of his complaints were accepted and addressed. In those situations where there was disagreement, Ron noted that he did not have to "bottle up" his negative feelings. At least he had been heard. After a year, Ron's feelings of stagnation decreased. He found himself more creative and took greater initiative at work. Ron also realized that two relationships he had at work were no longer satisfying to him- he was beginning to outgrow the need for dependency on self-serving authority figures. He began to consider looking for another job, one in which he would be more able to pursue his goals. HOW TREATMENT MODIFIES THE IDEAL SELF Sandler, Holder, &amp; Meers (1963) discuss the derivation of shame and guilt as disorders related to the ideal self: "Shame arises when the indi- vidual perceives himself (or believes himself to be perceived by others) as having failed to live up to the ideal standards which he accepts ... 'I cannot see myself as I want to see myself or as I want others to see me' .... Guilt is experienced when his ideal self differs from that which he feels to be dictated by his introjects ... ťI do not really want to be what I feel I ought to be'" (p. 157). Introjects within the ideal self thus can trigger feelings of greatness or shame or feelings of goodness or guilt (Josephs, 1989, pp. 82-83). A child tries to pursue what will achieve the goals formulated for him by his or her parents. Should that not be possible the child fears negative reactions from those whose approval is needed. The introjected parentified goals may be unrealistic and inflexible, communicating, "If you fail, you are a failure." Shame results. If the ideal self is not consistent with the hopes originally set forth by the parents- the discrepancy possibly arising from the child's attempts to individuate (Miller, 1986)- guilt feelings are likely to be triggered. These parentified introjects communicate: "You are a bad child." To avoid triggering shame or guilt in the workplace, the individual may shut down on the job. The work inhibition protects the self from loss of self-esteem in the short-term. In the long-term, however, the inability</page><page sequence="12">298 Kleinberg to pursue goals or achieve ambitions results in career stagnation (Erikson, 1968). The group experience modifies the introjects of the ideal self. The group members may support the individual's attempt to risk psychological separation from the family and the development of introjects that are more realistic and flexible than were the parentified ones. The inevitable trans- ferences developed in group in part reflect components of the ideal self projected onto other members and the leader. Highlighting and resolving these transferences should allow the individual's inhibition to ease, first within the group process, and later in the workplace. Alternatively, new introjects can be incorporated within the ideal self. The admired therapist- or peer-introject may reconstitute the ideal self which, in turn, provides the patient with more realistic and flexible guide- lines for work behavior and attitudes. In order for this significant alteration to occur the individual must feel relatively safe and free of pressure. Har- wood (1983) recalls Kohut's warning that group pressure diminishes indi- viduality (1978, pp. 8-39). Harwood advises that the "role of the therapist must be to ensure that all persons are allowed to discover, and to march to, the beat of their own drummer" (p. 471). Optimal conditions of safety and little pressure to conform need to be maintained to allow for transient identifications with other working group members. WI patients can then lower their guard and take in new, admired and realistic introjects into their ideal self. The members may ex- perience this process as playful and even comment: "This doesn't seem like therapy." Play, to Winnicott (1975), is an unchallenged intermediate area of psy- chological experience between the selves of the baby and the caregiver. The infant is "lost in play," and this is fostered by the significant other who does not "challenge the infant in regard to subjectivity or objectivity" (p. 241). Winnicott (1975) describes the corresponding experience of adults in group: "If ... the adult can manage to enjoy the personal intermediate area [of experience] without making claims, then we can acknowledge our own corresponding intermediate areas, and are pleased to find examples of over- lapping, that is to say common experience between members of a group ...." (p. 241). As group patients troubled by WI enter this intermediate psycho- logical space in the course of play, changes in the ideal self can result. CLINICAL ILLUSTRATION In Ron's initial phase of group treatment he was seen as cynical and barely emotionally present. In the concurrent individual sessions, Ron re-</page><page sequence="13">Treating Work Inhibition 299 vealed his expectation that he could not live up to the other members' standards of how one should engage in therapy. He then seemed to give up without really trying. When he was encouraged to participate, Ron would question the merits of group and sit back with a "show me" attitude. He described in an individual session that he felt he was letting me down and was being "bad." Further inhibition in his work behavior in the group followed to avoid feelings of shame. These brief excerpts from two sessions- Ron's 20th and 21st sessions in group- show how his difficulty in working in group began to provoke anger at him. This group reaction to his aloofness could have led to his further withdrawal, or even termination. Instead, the therapist began to focus on the genesis of his pattern in group, its adaptive function and the judgments (related to aspects of his ideal self) that he was making about himself and others that restricted his engagement. From the 20th Session Ms. X: Ron, you always sit back and just listen to us with an irritated look on your face. Mr. Y: Yeah. I wish we could get to know you more. Ron: I just don't feel like saying anything. Mr. Z: It really bothers me that you just sit there when we're working so hard at this. Therapist (Realizing that the members were beginning to launch a group attack on Ron, who was being provocative in his silence): Ron, I'm sure that you're not sitting with a completely blank mind; you're just choosing not to share what you're thinking with us. Ron: I'm just thinking that this process won't work for me. I have so much trouble in groups. At work, I come across as angry and critical. Therapist: There's so much pessimism that this group- any group- could really work for you. That perhaps is what you concluded from your ex- perience growing up with your family. Ron: I could never get what I needed. And from my father I got abuse. He would encourage me and then not be there when I needed him. He was always off on another business trip. And my mother was too wrapped up in her issues to notice what was happening to me. Ms. X: But I'm not like one of your family members. You're not even giving me a chance. Mr. Z: You've disqualified us- you don't even want to get into the game. Therapist: I wonder if Ron's pessimism then and now stems from his own feelings that he doesn't have what it takes to get what he needs here. Ms. Y: But Ron is very smart and articulate.</page><page sequence="14">300 Kleinberg Therapist: But also very self-critical. Ron (who has been following this interchange very closely): I know that what I'm doing here is what I do at my job and with my girlfriend. I keep myself out of things because I just know I'm going to be disappointed. Therapist: Not just in yourself, but in others, too. Mr. Z (to Ron): Do I do anything to make you feel that I will not try to be there for you? Ron (thinking for a moment): This is something I just have to think about. I guess I make certain assumptions that I need to check out. From the 21st Session Mr. Z (who really seems to be interested in investigating his relationship with Ron): I have been wondering if Ron has given more thought to why he doesn't participate in group. Therapist: We need to note that last week Ron was quite active. Ms. Y: I think I got to know you a bit more. Ron: My tendency is to stay quiet; keep myself out of things. I don't think I'm really as good as the rest of you at this. Therapist: Did you have this view of yourself when you were a kid ... that you didn't have what it takes to get your dad to take an interest in you? Ron: I spent a lot of time alone and must have been pretty depressed then. DISCUSSION OF CLINICAL MATERIAL Following these two sessions, Ron's work behavior in group began to shift. He was somewhat less aloof and more revealing about himself and his reactions to others. The other members welcomed this change. Ron's worst fears were not realized. Apparently the group members sufficiently valued Ron so as not to turn their backs on him. The group composition enabled Ron to form transient identifications with members who were not experiencing WI. The group's safe climate and Ron's strong working alliance with the therapist made it possible for Ron to incorporate more realistic and less demanding introjects into his ideal self. Ron was able to engage more deeply in the group process with less anxiety about losing self-esteem from disappointing others. Drawing parallels with Ron's early history underscored the adaptive function of his inhibition in the group. Personal insight helped Ron feel less shame for not working as well as the other members. Furthermore, reviewing the genesis of Ron's WI reduced the frustration that other pa-</page><page sequence="15">Treating Work Inhibition 301 tients were feeling towards him. They now understood that for Ron disen- gagement once made sense. As Ron experienced less criticism and more understanding, he began to participate when the group entered a playful mode. His WI in the group diminished and he became a more active participant. Within six months of his entry into the group, Ron experienced himself as less angry at work. He identified an unmet organizational need that seemed like a challenge. He approached his supervisor who welcomed Ron's initiative and approved the project. Ron reported this development to the group. The members felt that Ron's gain at work was an accom- plishment in which all could take pride. CONCLUSION Patients suffering from work inhibition (WI) report disengagement and boredom on the job. Some may be receiving negative evaluations from su- pervisors and negative feedback from colleagues. It is likely that WI pa- tients upon entering group will experience similar inhibitions in the treatment. Therapists sensitive to the underlying dynamics, particularly an ideal self that sets standards impossible to meet and its genetic history, can address the patient's fears about greater participation. If the group is ex- perienced as relatively safe and not making excessive demands, the WI pa- tient may be able to explore the adaptive function of disengagement in the group, the workplace and historically, the family of origin. Once the group and the individual understand the function of the inhibition, the WI patient may be able to incorporate more flexible, realistic and less demanding in- trojects into his/her ideal self. Once the ideal self is modified, the patient's inhibition in group decreases as fears of not living up to the standards set by others diminish. Reduced inhibition in group is likely to generalize to the workplace. REFERENCES Connelly, J.L. &amp; Piper, W.E. (1989).
