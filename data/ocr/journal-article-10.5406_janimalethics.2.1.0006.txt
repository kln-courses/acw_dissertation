<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The Neoteny Barrier:   Seeking Respect for the Non-Cute MARK J. ESTREN Mark J. Estren, Fort Myers, Florida. A foundational human attraction to mammalian neoteny may be crucial for preser- vation of our own species, but it can be counterproductive in relationships between  humans and other animals. The deeply rooted human psychological attraction to and  preference for anthropomorphically viewed neotenic characteristics explains why some  animals, whether endangered or not, receive far more public attention and scientific  study than others. An understanding of the neoteny barrier makes it possible to find  ways around it: The barrier may not be possible to break, but it can be modified by  scientific awareness of its existence and an alteration of public perception of value to  include animals who would not, in neotenic terms, be considered cute. Anyone looking for an improved relationship between humans and other animals runs  quickly, if unknowingly, into a blockage that seems at first insuperable: the neoteny bar- rier. Humans generally are more attracted to animals who retain infantile characteristics  into adulthood. This is, at bottom, a biological imperative derived from the appearance of  human babies, with their proportionately larger heads and eyes and, as they age slightly,  their unsteady gait. Human attraction to neotenic animals relates directly to nurturing  and species-propagating instincts for our own kind and also explains why, for example,  we find a penguin’s waddle amusingly endearing.  There are two possible evolutionary explanations for our focus on neoteny: We may  be born with an aesthetic sense that causes us to favor juvenile morphological traits,  or our genes may tell us to favor whatever traits our offspring happen to have (Gould,  1980b). In either case, the effect is the same: The animals to whom we feel the greatest  attraction are those whom we deem, because of their morphology, to be cute.  This preference is all-pervasive and largely unconscious. And it is not confined to  humans. The existence in other mammals of infants with big, widely spaced eyes, a but- ton nose, and a mouth set low in the face explains why lactating mothers of one species,  such as dogs, have been known to nurse infants of another, such as cats (Angier, 2010).  The well-intentioned desire to have humans treat other animals with greater respect  can collide head-on with neotenic preferences, which permeate society to an extent that is  Journal of Animal Ethics 2 (1): 6–11 © 2012 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois </page> <page sequence="2">  Estren, Neoteny Barrier 7 rarely acknowledged. In Japan, for example, the ubiquitous Hello Kitty appears on more  than 20,000 products made or licensed by Sanrio, which owns the character. Hello Kitty  is such a phenomenon because she “needs protection,” says Boston University sociologist  Merry White. “She’s not only adorable and round, she’s also mouthless and can’t speak  for herself” (quoted in Garger, 2007).  Cartoon characters, created out of nothingness from artists’ minds, provide a particu- larly clear example of the ubiquity of neotenic preference. Pixar Studios carefully made  Remy, the star of its animated movie Ratatouille, blue, fluffy, and snub-nosed, more like  an animated plush toy than a real rat. In this approach, Pixar was following in the footsteps  of its corporate parent, Walt Disney Company, where Mickey Mouse evolved during half  a century to have a bigger head, bigger eyes, and larger cranial vault than he originally  possessed—plus limbs that appeared shorter and thus more “babyish” to human viewers  because they were covered with clothing (Gould, 1980a).  Similar evolution is readily seen in other animal-based cartoon characters. Betty Boop,  the curvy flapper-era animated star, originated as a dog with long ears but did not really  take off in popularity until she was redrawn in her much more familiar shape, with huge  head, tiny button nose, and great big eyes—all neotenic characteristics (Bogin, 1999).  And in Walt Kelly’s famous comic strip Pogo, no fewer than three major characters un- derwent significant neotenic transformation. Pogo Possum himself originally had a very  long snout and close-together eyes; over time, the snout shortened significantly, and the  eyes became bigger and wider. Porkypine originally looked much like a real porcupine  and walked on all fours, later attaining upright posture, quills more closely resembling  unruly hair, and wide eyes. And P. T. Bridgeport, the pompous circus character named  for P. T. Barnum and the city of Bridgeport, Connecticut, with which both Barnum and  Kelly were associated, metamorphosed most rapidly: “It was not many days after the  introduction of P. T. Bridgeport that I decided to change the model. The first seemed a  little unpleasant to me” (Kelly, 1959, p. 44). The “unpleasant” character had jowls and  close-set eyes; the changed one, a round and puffy face and much larger eyes spaced  farther apart.  In everyday life, human preference for the neotenic plays out constantly: People tend  to find squirrels cute and their close relatives, rats, abhorrent; koalas, despite their prickly  personalities, are considered so adorable that the United States has labeled the koala  a threatened species even though Australia says it is not (Endangered and Threatened  Wildlife and Plants, 2000)—whereas the koala’s closest living relative, the short-legged,  pig-faced, beady-eyed wombat, garners little attention or interest.  There may be distinct evaluative benefits to the human preference for neoteny, paral- leling as it does the phylogenetic history of our species: “There he stands—our vertical,  hunting, weapon-toting, territorial, neotenous, brainy naked ape, a primate by ancestry  and a carnivore by adoption, ready to conquer the world” (Morris, 1967, p. 97).  But the strong human attraction to neoteny must be of the greatest concern to any- one seeking more-ethical treatment of all animals. Humans’ neotenic preferences are  mammal-specific: Little outcry is heard from nonscientists about the remarkable axolotl,  </page> <page sequence="3"> 8 Journal of Animal Ethics, 2 (2012) a neotenic mole salamander that lives only in the Xochimilco area of central Mexico,  where fewer than 1,200 are thought to survive (Walker, 2009). The axolotl, with tiny eyes,  prominent gills, and slimy skin, does not possess the sort of neoteny to which humans  are generally attracted. And yet it was to describe the retention of larval features in the  Mexican axolotl that the word “neoteny” was originally coined.1  Other “unattractive” animals, endangered or not, also tend to engender scorn, some- times masquerading as humor, from scientists and the public alike—with the result that  they are demeaned in terms of their “worthiness,” and attempts to preserve them become  an uphill battle.  A straightforward web search readily turns up headlines such as “10 Endangered Spe- cies That Are Too Ugly to Live,” “Ugly Endangered Species,” and “Who Wants to Save  an Ugly Animal?” Some such sites are well-meaning, arguing that even “ugly” animals  deserve to live. But the patronizing nature of this anthropomorphic evaluation of animal  appearance does as much harm as good, substituting human attitudes toward cuteness— which are based on neotenic characteristics of human babies and other mammals—for  an objective consideration of the importance of each species within its ecological niche.  Indeed, so deep are human response patterns to animals with particular characteristics  that scientists breeding animals for friendliness have found themselves with ones who  also appear, to human eyes, cuter. In Russia’s famous multi-decade fox-farm experiment, selecting which foxes to breed based solely on how well they got along with humans  seemed to alter their physical appearance along with their dispositions. After only nine  generations, the researchers recorded fox kits born with floppier ears. Piebald patterns  appeared on their coats. By this time the foxes were already whining and wagging their  tails in response to a human presence, behaviors never seen in wild foxes. (Ratliff, 2011)  The neoteny barrier is a significant real-world problem, even among scientists. A  recent study of conservation scientists’ efforts found that the scientific investment per species differed greatly between groups—the mean  number of papers per threatened large mammal eclipsed that of threatened reptiles,  birds, small mammals, and amphibians by 2.6-, 15-, 216-, and more than 500-fold,  respectively. Thus, in the eyes of science, all species are not created equal. A few  species commanded a great proportion of scientific attention, whereas for many spe- cies information that might inform conservation is virtually nonexistent. (Trimble &amp;  Van Aarde, 2010, p. 886)  What is to be done? Recognition of the prejudicial nature of human response to  animals is not in itself sufficient. People’s preference for mammalian neoteny is far too  deeply rooted to be mitigated, much less eliminated, by reasoned argument alone. But  a two-pronged approach, one for scientists and one for the public at large, may provide  reason for hope—and has, to a limited extent, already begun.  Within the scientific community, rationality and a form of enlightened self-interest  have their place. It is incumbent on those conservationists who are aware of human  </page> <page sequence="4">  Estren, Neoteny Barrier 9 predisposition toward animals with neotenic features to draw the attention of their  colleagues to less-studied animals with a less overtly “cute” appearance. A suggestion  that research-related rewards, and even funding, might be more readily forthcoming  for work on animals whose appearance makes them less frequently studied would not  be out of place.  Scientists respond well to research findings, and there is increasing awareness of  the disparity between species needing protection and those receiving it—a divergence  attributable in part to neoteny and also to other elements of attractiveness, as anthropo- morphically defined (see, e.g., Frynta, 2010).  Daniel Frynta, an ecologist at Charles University in Prague, has studied the retention  and breeding of animals in zoos and has determined that a zoo-kept animal must have  particular characteristics: “It’s got to be big. It’s got to be cute. It’s got to behave or look  humanlike. If a critter is colorful, we like it. We also like it when zoo denizens play and  speak and travel in family groups” (quoted in Eveleth, 2010). The reasons for this, Frynta  says, are largely economic, not scientific: “Zoos full of endangered but ugly animals will  never make money” (quoted in Eveleth, 2010). Increasing awareness of this reality may  well raise the hackles and thus modify the research thrust of scientists, including those  who, however unwittingly, themselves contribute to the minimization of the importance  of “ugly” species by focusing their investigative attention on neotenic and otherwise  anthropomorphically attractive ones.  And the “importance” argument provides a bridge between matters of concern to  scientists and those of significance to the general public. An animal whom many people  consider repulsive or frightening may gain popular backing once the animal’s usefulness  to humans is made clear: Our self-interest overcomes our visceral aversion. Thus, the  Year of the Snake in China (2001) brought a new appreciation of the reptiles, who are  deemed a delicacy, after farmers became more fully aware of serpents’ crucial role in  controlling rodents: “The intensive hunting of wild snakes caused the mouse population  to explode, with devastating consequences for crops” (“China Snake Craze,” 2001).  Similarly, the dull-brown, small-finned, long-bodied, long-snouted opossum pipefish  (Microphis brachyurus lineatus)—listed in the United States as a “species of concern” for  more than a decade—is anything but cute from a human perspective, but it is an impor- tant indicator of habitat quality in tropical and subtropical aquatic habitats, whose health  in turn gives humans important information about the quality of our own environment  (Buczynski, 2010). Emphasizing the usefulness of species to humans can overcome the  fact that the species are not attractive to most people. A few educational programs that  take just this approach are already in existence or under development.2 They can even be  extended over time to include animals who are neither attractive nor directly useful to  humans—but who are nevertheless worthy of protection. This is precisely what EDGE  (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered),3 a program of the Zoological Society  of London, is attempting to do, basing its approach on the importance of phylogenetic  diversity (Isaac, 2007). </page> <page sequence="5"> 10 Journal of Animal Ethics, 2 (2012)  In addition to these efforts, there is something to be said for encouraging a kind of  contrarianism-of-appearance focus among scientists and the lay public alike. We humans  have ourselves, through selective breeding, engineered animals who would scarcely be  considered “cute” by neotenic standards, such as the Sphynx (Canadian hairless) cat, a  breed that has existed for less than half a century. What is important is that such human- created “ugly” animals quickly develop followings of people who insist that they are, in a  sense, beautiful.4 Indeed, the aforementioned axolotl is fancied as an interesting aquarium  denizen and is kept as such by people in many countries.  No one would suggest that human standards of beauty can be easily changed; indeed,  an understanding of neoteny argues that they cannot foundationally be changed at all.  But the adaptability of humans to new circumstances is among our species’ most salient  characteristics, and if we cannot escape our attraction to neotenic mammalian animals,  there is some evidence that we can expand our definition of attractiveness to encompass  animals who would not, at first glance, be deemed “cute.” To the extent that we can do  this, the animals will benefit from our willingness to see them in a new light, and we  ourselves will gain a valuable perspective on some of the other inhabitants of our planet.
