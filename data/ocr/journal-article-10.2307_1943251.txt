The significance of termite nests to biological theory, however, has been only partially stressed, although Darwin (1859) places considerable emphasis upon the evolution of "instinct" as illustrated by "neu- ter and sterile insects." He states: But I must confess, that, with all my faith in natural selection, I should never have anticipated that this principle could have been efficient in so high a degree, had not the case of these neuter insects led me to this conclusion. I have, therefore, discussed this case, at some little but wholly insufficient length, in order to show the power of natural selection, and like-wise because this is by far the most serious special difficulty which my theory has encoun- tered. The case, also, is very interesting, as it proves that with animals. as with plants, any amount of modification may be effected by the accumulation of numerous, slight, spontaneous variations, which are in any way profitable, without exercise or habit having been brought into play. For peculiar habits confined to the workers or sterile females, however long they might be fol- lowed, could not possibly affect the males and fertile females, which alone leave descendants. I am surprised that no one has hitherto advanced this de- monstrative case of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of in- herited habit, as advanced by Lamarck. Subsequent writers have referred to Darwin's statement and have used the sterile castes as an argument against the Lamarckian concept (Ball, 1890, 1894; Weismann 1893; Holmes 1911), but the rich recent information made available through greater exploration and systematic study of tropical faunas has not yet been adequately interpreted. I propose, in the following pages, to present the best cases known to me illustrating the principles of evolution as applied to termite nesting behavior. I am indebted to Mr. G. F. Hill, Senior Entomologist in the Division of Economic Entomology in Australia, an eminent contributor to our knowledge of termites, for the photographs of Australian termite nests. The African nests were photographed by Mr. Herbert Lang while on the Lang-Chapin expedition of the American Museum of Natural History during which he made a splendid collection of termites and took many valuable field notes. The other photographs were taken by the author or under the author's di- rection. Studies of north African and European termites were made by the author during the tenure of a John Simon Guggenheim fellowship, during which time Dr. F. Santschi and Dr. F. Silvestri were particularly helpful. Studies [ 249 ]</page><page sequence="4">250 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs Vol. 8. No. 2 in British Guiana were made at the Tropical Research Station of the New York Zoological Society at Kartabo, and I am greatly indebted to the director, Dr. William Beebe, for the opportunities he afforded. Studies in Panama were largely made at the Barro Colorado Island Laboratory of the Institute for Research in Tropical America. The author is indebted to Mr. James Zetek for many courtesies extended during his sojourn on the island. My thanks are due Mr. George Lee for the opportunity to study savannah ter- mites in Panama. For the opportunity to study Californian termites, I am indebted to the Termite Investigations Committee and particularly to Dr. C. A. Kofoid and Dr. S. F. Light. I am also grateful to many men interested in this problem with whom I have had conversations or correspondence, although they should not be held responsible for any erroneous views expressed in the following pages. Among them all, I should particularly mention Dr. W. C. Allee, Mr. G. F. Hill, Dr. N. A. Kemner, Dr. H. Kluiver, Dr. T. E. Snyder, Dr. W. M. Wheeler and Dr. Sewall Wright. TERMITE NESTS AS ILLUSTRATIONS OF BEHAVIOR EVOLUTION The nests of termites have certain attributes which make them objects of great biological interest. These may be listed as follows: (1) The nest structures are morphological expressions of behavior pat- terns. This quality makes aspects of behavior evolution as visible as mor- phological evolution and similar principles and terms may be directly applied. (2) The nest results from the activity of a large number of individuals co- operating in building, organizing and enlarging the structure. Individual variation is thus practically cancelled and the nest stands as an expression of the behavior of a population. (3) The nest-forming behavior is predominantly an inherited species-pat- tern. The nests of a given species show striking similarity in material, gen- eral shape, internal organization and ecological position. In most instances, the workers which construct the nest have had no contact with workers of other colonies. The reproductive castes, which do not exhibit complicated nest-building behavior, fly from the parental nest, pair, and lay eggs which develop into workers which again establish a nest with the specific char- acteristics of the parental nest. (4) The caste which builds the nest in all the higher termites is the sterile worker helped, in some cases at least, by the larger soldier nymphs. Thus we have a complete control over any possibility of the inheritance of an acquired character. No nest-building habit or structural modification of a sterile caste acquired during ontogeny could be transmitted to the succeeding generation. This control over any Lamarckian influence is even better than that found in other social insects. Workers of wasps, bees and ants, although without</page><page sequence="5">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 251 socially functional young in most cases, not infrequently lay eggs which, being unfertilized and haploid, develop into fertile males. This is not known among termites. Workers of termites may, therefore, be considered as so- matic individuals, physiologically separated from the germ plasm of the re- productive individuals, making a directive influence upon the genetic deter- miners a practical impossibility. (5) The nests are definitive enough and at the same time specific enough to give us excellent evolutionary sequences. These may be correlated with the known morphological evolutionary relationships of the species. We have nest sequences of species in the same genus available, information that should give us a clue to the influence of species divergence upon these behavior pat- terns. In numerous instances we also find nest characteristics common to many species within a single genus or a group of related genera, thus indi- cating a long stability of the inherited patterns. (6) Astonishing examples of adaptive modification of the nests together with convergent evolution of nest structure in certain environments present evidence of the force of selection acting upon the inherited patterns. (7) The evolution of the nesting behavior is one aspect of the evolution of polymorphism. The colony of polymorphic insects has many attributes of the individual multicellular organism and exhibits many interesting paral- lels to organismal coordination mechanisms and interrelations of parts. Natural selection probably acts upon the colony as a whole more than upon the individual termite. PRE-ISOPTERAN NESTING BEHAVIOR The available indications point toward excavation of wood as the primi- tive nesting behavior. Certain wood-eating roaches, such as Cryptocercius punctulatus Scudder, probably represent the closest approach to the activities of the blattoid ancestors of the termites. Cleveland (1934, p. 190) describes the excavations of this roach as follows: The wood is honeycombed with galleries which, for the most part, run parallel with the grain. In some of the sounder logs, particularly chestnut, which is often very hard, the roaches are seldom found near the outside. * * There is little evidence that they ever leave the log and enter the ground. * * They pass well-formed pellets of dry, woody material which is not uti- lized in any way for building purposes or for the construction of passage ways, differing in this respect from many species of more highly specialized termites. With reference to excavations for the ootheca, Cleveland (p. 207) states: a groove had been made in the wood where none existed before and the ootheca had been carried approximately six inches, placed in the groove, and sealed off so completely that only a portion of one end was visible.</page><page sequence="6">252 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs Vol. 8. No. 2 These observations and others indicate the probability that habitations in excavated wood and the care of the eggs, as well as wood-feeding, symbiotic relationship with gut-inhabiting protozoans, and development of a family organization, antedated the origin of the Isoptera. NESTING BEHAVIOR OF THE KALOTERMITIDAE Among the living termites, Mastotermes darwiniensis Froggatt (Masto- termitidae) is universally admitted to be the most primitive morphologically. However, the descriptions of its nesting activities (Hill 1921, 1925) would seem to indicate an advance over the behavior of kalotermitids usually con- sidered more advanced from a morphological standpoint. As Imms (1919) and Emerson (1926, p. 92) have remarked, in certain morphological details Archotermtopsis (Kalotermitidae) is more primitive than Mastotermies. One may either conclude that Mastotermes has undergone evolution toward more intricate behavior after its divergence from the ancestral isopteran stock, or else that degenerative evolution of the behavior patterns has occurred in the Termopsinae and other kalotermitids. With only meager evidence, I am in- clined toward the former hypothesis. From morphological considerations, Archotermapsis wroughtoni (Des- neux) is the most primitive living member of the Kalotermitidae. The fol- lowing description of the nest is taken from Imms (1919, p. 126), who also figures the galleries: Any structure which might be designated a termitarium or nest is absent, and the bulk of the members of a colony are to be found in irregular cham- bers situated in the decayed portions of a tree trunk. The wood is perforated in various directions by large galleries or tunnels. Certain of these passages pass outwards in a radial direction terminating just beneath the bark, if the latter be present. The majority, however, run in a longitudinal direction following the grain of the wood. The insect does not construct tunnels of cemented material on the surface of the tree trunk or the ground, as is the custom among a very large number of Termites. There is usually, therefore, no outward manifestation of its presence, which probably accounts for the insect having so long remained a rarity. When necessary, however, it closes up crevices by means of a cement of masticated ligneous material, or of ex- crementous matter held together by salivary secretion. The centre of a col- ony is occupied by the ova and very young larvae, and in their immediate vicinity the queens and kings are to be found. The above description also applies to the nests of species in the related genus, Zooternmopsis, found in the western United States. These species have been classed by Light (1934, v. 136) as "damp-wood termites" because they seem to be more dependent upon moisture than the majority of the Kaloter- mitidae which are often classed as "dry-wood termites." Both the damp- wood and dry-wood termites may live wholly within excavated wood and usually do not invade the soil, although in certain instances, notably Kalo- termes (Paraneotermes) simplicicornis Banks, soil excavations may be found (Light 1934, p. 140; 1937).</page><page sequence="7">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 253 EXCAVATING BEHAVIOR OF THE KALOTERMITIDAE Although the excavation of wood is probably the most primitive behavior for the construction of a protected nesting site, the responses to environ- mental factors are quite intricate. A cork in a test-tube containing a captive colony of Kalotermes flavicollis (Fabricius) was invaded by the termites through small openings about the diameter of the larger nymphs. The end of the cork was cut off with a knife and revealed the excavations of the - -~~~44 FIG. 1. Cork excavated by Kalotermes flazicollis. termites (Fig. 1). Through examination of the figure, it will be noted, in the first place, that the galleries are elongated and are strikingly correlated with the spring growth rings, only occasional passage. ways being found in the summer growth rings. This is probably a reaction to mechanical stimuli, although these rings doubtless differ in chemical composition as well. Secondly, it will be noted that the termites excavate close to the sur- face, but do not penetrate the surface. The layer between the excavation and the outside is so thin that light shines through when the cork is held up to the light. One might classify this phenomenon as a reaction to light, to changes of humidity or to a weakness in the thinner layers of cork. If pieces of wood within a test tube are subject to the attack of termites, no such thin layer is left, thus indicating that the weakened material is not the only factor, al- though the termites would seem to be sensitive to such differences. Like- wise, termites do not avoid light shining through glass test tubes or con- tainers, providing the light is not too hot and the humidity is not lowered materially. Toleration experiments and experiments with a humidity gra- dient conducted by Williams (1934) indicate sensitivity to humidity in most cases studied, although some of the Kalotermitidae do not seem to be highly sensitive to low humidities. Pending further experimentation, it would seem to me that a change in humidity was the factor dominantly responsible for the separation of the excavations from the exterior. Pillars of corky material are to be seen in the photograph. These have been left around the hollow lenticel pores in the cork running at right angles to the growth rings. Such pillars are probably best interpreted as reactions to changes in humidity. To what extent the excavating termites respond to stresses and strains in the wood has not yet been satisfactorily determined, although the problem is open to experimental attack. Observations, particularly by those investigat- ing damage to building construction wrought by termites, seem to indicate</page><page sequence="8">254 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs Vol. 8. No. 2 that termites will not weaken timbers sustaining weights to the point of collapse. If such timbers collapse, extra strains have been placed upon them through storms, earthquakes, or additional weights to which the termites have had no opportunity to react while making their excavations. Spatial factors may also play a role but have not been much investigated. There is little to indicate that the presence of the king, queen, young or eggs influence the excavation activities of the Kalotermitidae. These primi- tive termites do not have grossly enlarged queens and the reproductive castes are usually found in galleries approximating the size and general appearance of the other galleries. Eggs may be found in the cells occupied by or near the reproductive castes. They may be picked up and gathered into small groups by the nymphs as has been observed by the author in captive colonies of Zootermoposis angusticollis (Hagen) and Kalotermes flazvicollis. CONSTRUCTION BEHAVIOR OF THE KALOTERMITIDAE Although excavation as the result of feeding activities supplies termites with a protected nesting site, positive constructions supplement the burrows in producing habitations even in the most primitive kalotermitids. After the colonizing flight and subsequent pairing, the reproductive couple of Kalotermes minor Hagen excavates a small hole or cell in available wood and plugs the entrance. Harvey (1934, p. 225) states: "This plug is a mix- ture of partially chewed wood and a secretion of the termites which acts as a cement." The worker-like nymphs of a mature colony of Zootermopsis angusticollis kept in a quart mason jar built extensive partitions separating cells in the excavated wood and also connecting the wood with the glass. These parti- tions were made largely from the pellets of excrement which were cemented by saliva, and by liquid excrement which was extruded upon the pellets worked into place by the mouth-parts. Small experimental holes made in the metal cover of the jar were plugged in a similar manner. The nymphs would seem to react directly to changes in humidity, although other factors may also contribute to the cooperative action involved in building a partition. Such building activities as those described for Kaloternies and Zooter- mopsis are probably to be found with little variation throughout the Kalo- termitidae. In a few instances, permanent runways may be excavated through soil which enable the termite colony to exploit food resources out- side the nest. Such runways are not common in the Kalotermitidae, but have been reported by Light (1934a, p. 311; 1937). NESTING BEHAVIOR OF THE MASTOTERMITIDAE AND HODOTERMITIDAE Hill's (1921, 1925) accounts of the nests of Mastotermes darwiniensis leave little doubt that the nesting behavior must be more specialized than</page><page sequence="9">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 255 that found in the Kalotermitidae. The nests are subterranean and are not always closely associated with the feeding excavations. Extensive con- struction and covered galleries are reported; the colonies contain over a million individuals, and foraging termites may destroy wooden materials over a hundred yards from the nest. Even though this account gives the impression of rather specialized nesting behavior, it would seem to differ quantitatively rather than qualita- tively from that of the Kalotermitidae. The hodotermitids seem to be an offshoot of primitive kaloter-nitids or possibly pre-kalotermitids. Their social organization indicates consider- able specialization beyond that observed in the Kalotermitidae. They have become harvesters and feed largely upon grass; they have an active, pig- mented caste with compound eyes which forages on the surface in the day time and is usually considered an adult worker, a caste which seems to be lacking in the Mastotermitidae and Kalotermitidae. Accompanying the evolution of structure and social integration, we find elaborate nesting behavior transcending anything observed among other primitive termites. Fuller (1915) has given excellent descriptions and figures of the nests of the South African species of this family (also Hegh 1922, pp. 232, 233). The nests of Hodotermes (H.) mossacmbicus trans- vaalensis Fuller are built in excavated chambers under the surface of the earth. The soil is brought to the surface and dropped in small piles which are distributed by the rain. Fuller (p. 350) states: The hive-cavities, with one exception, were all sub-spherical, having a horizontal diameter of 24 in. and a perpendicular height of 18 in. The cavi- ties are partitioned by very numerous horizontal and close-set shelves. These are constructed of a thin and very papery substance which does not dissolve in water or in alcohol. The shelves lie one above another with strik- ing regularity, and are attached to a series of clay brackets projecting from the walls. The shelves are not equi-distant apart throughout the cavity, but range from 6 to 15 mm. Innumerable little cylindrical columns of wooden texture, spread over the field of each shelf, hold the whole fabric together. These little columns are not stairways; the insects pass up and down from storey to storey of the hive by short inclines. Of particular interest is the construction of the supporting columns. It would seem necessary to assume an intricate reaction to strains in the nest material to account for such elaborate architecture. Nests of Hodotermnes (Anacanthotermes) ochrcceus (Burmeister) which I examined on the outskirts of Kairouan, Tunisia, consisted of soil excavations without surface indications except that the soil particles had been cemented together over the cells near the surface forming a brittle cover which gave off a hollow sound when lightly tapped. Some of these cells were filled with strips of plant epidermis from the stems of surrounding scrub vegetation. A tiny termitid, Eremotermes indicatus Silvestri, was</page><page sequence="10">256 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs found living in these storage cells feeding upon the food gathered by H. ochraceus. Extensive chambers contained all stages of nymphs and all castes of H. ochraceus. A mason jar was filled with soldiers and various sizes of "workers." The smallest was about Y2 cm. long and the largest about 1 cm. long. Soil together with strips of plant epidermis collected by the termites was also included. The termites immediately started to construct passageways and galleries and to accumulate the food. The construction was performed by working pieces of dirt moistened by saliva into place with the mouth-parts. No abdominal excretion was observed during the construction activities. All sizes of "workers" including the next to the smallest engaged in the labor. These data indicate a much more developed nesting behavior in the Ho- dotermitidae than has been found among the Kalotermitidae. The emanci- pation from a wood diet, the construction of subterranean galleries, the storage of food, and the subtle manipulation of materials in the construc- tion of complex layers of cells, passageways and supports; all indicate greater elaboration of the inherited behavior patterns than is found else- where below the Termitidae. NESTING BEHAVIOR OF THE RHINOTERMITIDAE The family Rhinotermitidae was derived, according to the available morphological evidence (Hare, 1937), from a kalotermitid stock fairly closely related to Stolotermes. The social development is much more marked than in the Kalotermitidae and a true sterile adult worker caste has become differen- tiated. Specialization of the worker is accompanied by larger numbers of individuals in the colonies, enlargement in size and reproductive capacity of the queen, incorporation of certain specialized termitophiles into the social community-all indicative of more complex social organization. Excavations and passageways in the soil enable these insects to reach soil moisture which seems to be necessary for their existence in nature and also enables them to exploit food resources remote from their nests. Be- cause of their adjustment to soil conditions, they are typical "subterranean termites" and have been so classed by Snyder (1920, p. 89). The development of more elaborate nesting behavior might be expected in this family, but in reality the nests are still largely to be found in ex- cavated galleries in wood with somewhat more complex cells, partitions and covered tunnels than are characteristic of the Kalotermitidae. The more elaborate nest structures among the Rhinotermitidae are made by certain species of Coptotermes. Oshima (1919) has published some ex- cellent figures of the nests of C. formosanus Shiraki. He states (p. 333): The nest consists of a mixture of abdominal excreta and clay or sand, pasted together with a special secretion of the salivary glands. Sometimes</page><page sequence="11">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 257 it is rigid and compact and seems like a piece of rock. However, it is in- flammable and burns rapidly, leaving a small amount of ash. Ehrhorn (1934, p. 327, 329) shows photographs of the nests of the same species and Light (1934, p. 142) figures the nests of C. vastator Light. Hill (1915, p. 92) gives an excellent description of the nests of C. acinaciformis (Froggatt) accompanied by photographs. This species builds conspicuous mounds usually found at the base of a tree or enveloping a stump. The mounds may reach a height of six to eight feet. The walls of these nests are constructed of fine particles of earth and sand firmly ce- mented together. The walls vary in thickness from two inches near the top to twelve inches near the ground or on the sides. The interior is composed of triturated wood molded into curious forms. Near the ground are found thin-walled horizontal cells serving as the "nursery." Hill also states: The queen is generally found about three inches from the ground, and about the middle of the nest, in a low domied cell with more or less level floor, from which she cannot excape. It is apparent that the nests of Coptoterm1es illustrate the use of various materials, the organization around social functions, and reaction to the pres- ence of the queen resulting in the construction of a "royal cell." During the colonizing period it is necessary that exits from the nest be made in order to allow the imagoes to emerge. Holes are excavated by the workers in all cases observed and the soldiers guard the exits during the emergence of the imagoes. The exits are plugged by the workers at the end of the flight. Two instances of building activity associated with the colonizing flight have been observed. Wood of a beam in a small house three miles from Kartabo, British Guiana, was infested with Coptotermnes testaceus (L.). On the morning of July 2, 1924, Dr. S. C. Crawford and the writer noticed workers constructing a small shelf about an inch long, a half inch wide and a half inch high, at the mouth of a small excavated hole in the wood on the vertical face of the beam. Soldiers guarded the opera- tions. About two hours later a light rain fell and as it ceased, flying imagoes of the species were noticed. They were soon discovered emerging from the hole in the beam and using the shelf as a platform from which they took to the air. The next morning only a plugged hole was visible, the workers having dismantled the shelf during the night. Mr. James Zetek observed a somewhat similar construction during a flight of C. niger Snyder from the base of a tree in Ancon, Canal Zone, on August 26, 1923. It is extremely difficult to analyze such behavior in terms of responses to simple stimuli. Although our ignorance is great, one must assume re- sponses to intricate social stimuli. Anthropomorphic explanations, however, do not assist our understanding.</page><page sequence="12">258 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs Vol. 8. No. 2 NESTING BEHAVIOR OF THE TERMITIDAE The Termitidae are morphologically and socially the most specialized of the termites and have doubtless evolved from a rhinotermitid stock. The abundance of nest types are too numerous to describe in this report and only a few of the more outstanding and significant examples will be mentioned. Many nests of the Termitidae are not more elaborate than the simplest nests of the Rhinotermitidae. In fact, some nests seem even less complex. The author dug into a subterranean nest of Syntermes snyderi Emerson in the rain-forest of British Guiana (Fig. 2) and found galleries extending FIG. 2. Subterranean excavated nest of Syntermes snyderi. below the surface to a depth of about four feet and covering a horizontal circular area with a diameter of about twelve feet. The galleries were large and seemed to be simple excavations in the sandy-clay soil, although there were small lumps lining the galleries in places that might have been excre- tions of the termites. The excavated dirt was deposited on the surface in</page><page sequence="13">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 259 loose piles above the nest. No covered tunnels were constructed on the surface, the termites moving in exposed trails. They cut out pieces of dead leaves which served as their food. Leaf fragments about one centimeter in diameter were stored in some compartments of the nest. The humidity and consistency of the material composing the walls of the excavated galleries must be fairly constant in such a nest. The exca- vating termites would seem to be reacting to spatial factors as well as to strains in the supporting walls, rather than to humidity or differentiation of material as in the case of Kalotermes flazicollis described in the preceding pages. NEST MATERIALS Materials composing the nests of termitids (see Hegh, 1922) are similar to those already described, but one often finds a given group specializing in the use of certain substances. Most of the species use particles of dirt or sand. The nest of Anoplotermes (A.) silvestrii Emerson in British Guiana was of such extreme hardness that sparks flew from the hatchet when the nest was opened. In laboratory colonies, no abdominal excretion was ob- served during the nest building activities. Each particle of dirt was mois- tened only with a salivary secretion as the worker placed it in position. Laboratory colonies of Microcerotermes arboreus Emerson, however, re- vealed the workers placing pieces of dirt moistened with saliva in place and then turning and excreting a drop of thick dark fluid upon the newly in- serted particle. Crepititermtes verruculosus Emerson exhibited still differ- ent actions. Practically all the building observed in the laboratory was con- structed through the use of abdominal excretions of thick dark fluid. The intestines of the workers seemed to be filled with this muddy material. They were sometimes observed to bring pieces of material for building, but no salivary secretion was seen nor did they work the material into place in the manner so characteristic of most termites. On the other hand, wood derivatives are used almost exclusively by the majority of the species of Nasutitermes, s. str. (Fig. 3), a tropicopolitan group of termites composed of a large number of species. These termites can build typical nests in such places as the branches of standing dead trees which have been killed by the rise of dammed waters in Gatun Lake during the construction of the Panama Canal. Such nesting sites are not available for species dependent upon dirt in the construction of their nests. Beaumont (Dudley, 1889, p. 91) described the construction activity of a species of Panamanian termite (either N. corniger (Motschulsky) or N. eph- ratae (Holmgren). The behavior is essentially similar to that described for Microcerotermes arboreus except that particles of wood or carton are used instead of dirt. Bugnion (1927, p. 18) also gives a fine detailed account of similar behavior of Nasutitermes (= Eutermes) ceylonicus (Holmgren) which uses both wood, sand and abdominal excretions in its construction. An</page><page sequence="14">260 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monograph- Vol. 8. No. 2 interesting variation was observed by the author while watching captive colonies of Nasutiterin&amp;es guayanae (Holnigren) in British Guiana. Instead of placing the piece of material in its position with saliva and then excreting 4,4 I~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ii FIG. 3. New cells in process of construction during th- enlargement of the nest of Nasittiterm,,es gueayauac. abdominal fluid, the termite invariably excreted the abdominal substance first, and then turned and worked the piece of building material into place with its mandibles. STRUCTURES The structures vary considerably in formn and function (see Hegh, 1922), thus indicating a wide variety of stimuli affecting the behavior pattern. Cov- ered tunnels may lead out from the nest. These are built along odor trails followed by the termites at times of high humidity. One of these covered tunnels built by N. guavanae led from a nest thirty feet up in a palm tree, down some vine stems to the ground, and around by a sandy clearing in the</page><page sequence="15">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 261 forest to a small dead tree. In all, the distance was 162 feet, although the dead tree was only 35 feet in a straight line from the palm tree. The covered tunnels may lead down into the ground where the excava- tions are lined with carton (materials cemented by saliva or excrement). Covered tunnels on the walls of Chilibrillo Cave, Panama, made by N. corniger, were estimated to be about twenty feet below the surface of the ground. William Beebe observed Macrotermes carbonarius (Hagan) at Penang, Malaya, walking in open trails on carton roadways which the termites con- structed over rough ground (See Emerson, 1937a, p. 247). I assume these roads to be a response to mechanical factors. Termites will use the same materials used in the construction of their nest or tunnels for burying foreign insects introduced into their colony. Dudley (1889) has figured this action in Nasutitermies and the author has witnessed it many times following the attack upon an introduced foreign termite or termitophile. The size of the nest is quite often fairly characteristic of the species. For example the nests of N. pilifrons (Holmgren) were quite often much larger than those of N. corniger or N. ephratae in Panama. Likewise in British Guiana, the nests of N. surinanmensis (Holmgren) were typically larger than those of N. guayanae, N. costalis, or N. ephratac and, in turn, these were larger than the nests of N. gaigei Emerson. The huge dirt nests of N. pyri- formis (Froggatt) reaching a height of 18 feet would seem to be charac- teristic of the species (Froggatt, 1905). The size of the nest may be propor- tional to colony size and reproductive capacity. The number of individuals in one nest (Emerson, 1937a, p. 247) of N. surinamensis was estimated quite carefully to be three million in round numbers. The nest measured six feet in height and three and one-half in greatest diameter. The queen from this nest was 24 mm. long and 8 mm. wide. She laid 2938 eggs in 18 hours. A small nest of Microcerotermes arboreus in British Guiana seemed small enough to count the entire colony (excepting foragers). It measured 6 in. long, 2 in. wide and 2 in. thick. The volume was approximately 110 cu. cm. There were 5876 termites and 2109 eggs in the nest. 4006 of the termites were mature and 1870 were nymphs. The mature individuals were composed of 1 queen, 1 king, 114 soldiers, and 3890 workers divided into 2624 large light-headed types, 939 small dark-headed types and 327 intermediates. Two larger nests of this same species contained about 250,000 eggs and 300,000 eggs respec- tively. A queen measuring 21 mm. in length laid 1680 eggs in 24 hours. The highest rate of oviposition which I have measured was 357 eggs in one hour in the case of a queen of Anoplotermes silvestrii which measured 50 mm. in length. These tropical queens continue to lay eggs steadily without much variation during diurnal or seasonal cycles and are doubtless often quite old. Through consideration of nests in Africa known to be at least</page><page sequence="16">262 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs Vol. 8, No. 2 40 or 50 years old and each occupied by a first form queen, I think such an age for some of the reproductive castes is not impossible. Enlargement of the nest may indicate some of the stimuli to which the workers respond. In the case of Nasutitermes guayanae (Fig. 3) a hole in FIG. 4. Vertical section of a nest of Nasutiterines costalis show- ing the thick walls in the vicinity of the royal cell. the exterior of the nest is made and a new cell is built over the opening. Workers build the walls on all sides until they meet at the top. Constricto- termes cavifrons (Holmgren) enlarges its nest by roofing the area between parallel surface ridges (Fig. 14). The point of junction between the walls is perfectly even and seems to be explained only in terms of subtle sensitivity to spatial relations. The subsequent thickening of the walls of the cells takes place below the surface. The walls in the vicinity of the royal cell are greatly thickened in the nests of many species of termites (Fig. 4) evidently stimu-</page><page sequence="17">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 263 lated by the presence of the queen. Grass6 (1937) gives an interesting and detailed account of the organization of the nest of Macrotermes (Bellicosi- termes) natalensis including consideration of the royal cell. Holdaway (1933) gives interesting data upon the chemical differences in materials composing the parts of the mound nests of Nasutitermes (= Eu- termes) exitiosus (Hill). An analysis of the inorganic material shows that the outer wall averages 64 per cent, the inner wall 15 per cent, and the FIG. 5. Mound nest of Amiterines unedius Banks. Aguadulce, Panama. "nursery" 11 per cent. There seems little doubt that social and environmental factors influence the use of materials in the same nest. By far the most astounding structural detail in the construc- tion of nest walls is to be found in the subterranean nests of the various species of the African genus Apicotermes. Careful de- scriptions and figures of these nests have been published (Des- neux 1918; Hegh 1922, pp. 385-394, 712; Sjiistedt 1923, 1926, Taf. 13; Reichensperger 1923). The determination of the known species is to be found in Sjbstedt (1926, p. 153). The simplest of these nests has ex- ternal walls perforated by tiny pores or channels too small for the termite to walk through and probably functioning as ventilation pores. The next most complex nest has the external openings of the pores emerging into small pits or holes considerably wider than the pores, and the most complex nests have circular galleries within the walls connected to the outside by small pores and to the inside by small pores of approximately equal diameter. In the latter case, it would seem difficult not to assume that the pits or holes of the second type of nest had evolved into the circular galleries of the third type. Such behavior evolution would seem to present a sequence which re- minds one of the ascon, sycon and leucon types of canal systems in the sponges. The nests of Apicoternes also illustrate most clearly the inherent nature of the hereditary influences upon the behavior which are generic in character rather than distinctive of species alone. Of course we might ex- pect to find certain types of behavior characteristic of larger groups than genera, and such is the case. The finest example of distinctive construction behavior characteristic of an entire subfamily (Macrotermitinae) is discussed later. Kinsey (1936, pp. 8, 56, 57) reviews current concepts of higher taxonomic categories. Among others, the concept that genera, subfamilies and families are arbitrary groupings merely for the convenience of the taxonomist and</page><page sequence="18">264 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs Vol. 8. No. 2 without objective reality has often been stated. The correlation of many morphological characteristics together with behavioristic, physiological, eco- logical and geographical characteristics as seen in the genera, subfamilies and families of termites has convinced the author that the groups of species are indicative of a relationship which may be scientifically symbolized in the names of the higher categories which thus rest upon sound objective evidence with statistical significance of correlation. As has already been pointed out, food is sometimes stored in the cells of the nests of Hodoternies and Syntermes. Food storage may involve con- struction activity also. In the nest of Constrictotermes cavifrons (Fig. 14) the basal hanging portion is composed of a dark pasty material which I in- terpret to be stored food. It is possible, however, that this is segregated ex- crement. In any case, the material has sufficient nutrient value to be used by a large number of other insects including tineid caterpillars probably be- longing to the genus Amydria. or Exoncotis (det. W. T. Forbes), larvae of an acanthocerid of the genus Acanthocerus, elaterid larvae, larvae of the sciarid genus Sciara, and finally another species of termite, Termes (a Mi- rotermes) inquilinus (Emerson). T. inquilinus has never been found in any other place and I am confident that it is confined to the nests of C. cav- ifrons. Its galleries are separated from those of the host termite and are lined with carton of its own construction, but the nesting activities largely consist of excavations in the stored organic material deposited by the host termite. If the two species come together when the nest is opened, a violent battle ensues. Although the nests of the genus Termes are not as definitive as those of most species of Nasutitermes, it seems safe to assume that this particular species of Ternwes has undergone degenerative evolution of the nesting behavior in association with its social semi-parasitism. The closest related species, Termes fur (Silvestri), seems to have the same relationship to Constrictotermes cyphergaster (Silvestri) (Silvestri 1903, p. 128). These cases remind one of the evolutionary degeneration of the nesting behavior among the parasitic birds and the genus Psithyrus of the bumble bees. Kemner (1929) interprets the existence of carton nodules in the nests of Microcerotermes depokensis Kemner as food storage activity. Similar nodules were observed in nests of Nasutitermes pilifrons during my studies of Panamanian termites, but I am not sure of their function. Probably the most remarkable construction activities associated with nu- trition are to be found in the fungus gardens of all species of the subfamily Macrotermitinae. The excrement of the termites or finely pulverized plant material (see Grass6, 1937) is built into elaborate convoluted structures so organized as to give a maximum surface for the growth of the fungus (Wheeler 1907; Sjbstedt 1907; Hegh 1922; Bugnion 1927). The gardens are quite distinct from the rest of the nest, which is constructed in quite a different manner. They present a picture of complex reactions to complex</page><page sequence="19">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 265 stimuli. Fungus-growing behavior is confined to this subfamily of termites. Examples of nest-building behavior patterns characteristic of higher tax- onomic categories of birds are given by Chapin (1917). CASTES INVOLVED IN NEST CONSTRUCTION The nests of the primitive Kalotermitidae are excavated or constructed by the nymphs of the soldiers and reproductive castes except for the original cell of the colonizing pair. It is probable that the Mastotennitidae follow Fic. 6. Mounds of Amitermes vitiosus (?) Hill between Camooweal, Queensland, and Newcastle Waters, Northern Territory. Photograph through the courtesy of G. F. Hill. the same rule. The situation among the Hodotermitidae is more obscure be- cause the exact status of the darkly pigmented, eyed "worker" has not been definitely established. Among the Rhinoterinitidae and Termitidae, the adult sterile worker has become differentiated through neoteinic evolution from the soldier nymph (Emerson, 1926, 1935; Hare, 1934). However, it is quite common to find smaller worker-like forms, fully pigmented and with the abdomens containing the same materials as those found in the adult workers. These individuals seem to be nymphs of workers or soldiers and their behavior is the same as that of the adult workers as far as is known (Emerson 1926). It is thus probable that the worker-like nymphs of the soldiers have the same complex behavior patterns as the workers, and func- tion in the construction and nutrient activities. Mature soldiers, however, never seem to assist in nest building. Snyder (1920, p. 190) states that the nasute soldier uses the fluid exuded from the beak in making shelter tubes, but I am convinced that this statement is an error. It has not been demon- strated that the nymphs of the reproductive castes of the Rhinotermitidae or Termitidae ever take an active part in gathering much food or constructing</page><page sequence="20">266 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs the elaborate nests. The construction of the original cell in wood or dirt by the colonizing pair, however, indicates that nesting behavior has not been wholly inhibited in the reproductive castes. Spencer (1893) attempted to explain the differences between the be- havior of the reproductive caste and the worker in the Hymenoptera as a loss of instinct on the part of the reproductive caste, the primitive species having the instincts before caste divergence took place. Holmes (1911) points out FiG. 7. East face of mounds of Arnitermes meridionalis. Photograph through the courtesy of G. F. Hill. the weakness of this contention, which is further demonstrated in the behavior evolution occurring long after the establishment of the adult sterile worker caste among the termites. ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE NEST The nest would seem to be of value to the termites as a means of con- trolling certain variables in the environment or for allowing sufficient elas- ticity of conditions to enable the insects to avoid certain environmental ex- tremes. In prder to test the variation in temperature within nests in relation to variations in the environment, two nests of Nasutitermes corniger on Barro Colorado Island were chosen. One was located in a clearing on a small stump, the base in contact with the ground and the top two feet from the ground. The stump was under a banana tree and was forty feet from the edge of the forest. The greatest diameter of the nest was one foot. A short thermometer (4 in.) was placed in a hole stoppered by a cork. The hole was about 1 inch wide and the bulb of the thermometer was 5?2 inches from the surface. The other nest was attached to a small vine in the forest about twenty feet from the edge of the clearing. The forest roof was about fifty feet high. The bottom of the nest was 1 /2 feet from the ground. The nest was 2 feet high and 1?Y2 feet in greatest diameter. A hole about 1 inch wide was dug into the nest so that the bulb of the thermometer (matched with th!</page><page sequence="21">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 267 TABLE 1.

Measurements (Table 1) were taken approximately on the hour on September 2d and 3d, 1935, for a period of over 24 hours. Light readings (in foot candles) were taken by means of a Weston illumi- nometer. In general the measurement of illumination in the sun in the clear- ing showed little difference from that on the nest. A light rain fell intermit- tently from 2.30 to 7.00 P.M. and doubtless influenced the temperature and illumination records. One concludes from these measurements (Table 1) that (1) the direct sun rays on the nest raise the internal temperature above the shade tempera- ture of the surroundings, and (2) that the temperatures follow the daily rhythm of the external temperatures, but lag behind the rising and falling external temperatures and do not reach the extremes found outside the nest. Of course, the sun temperatures outside the nest which reached maxima above 120'F. (the limit of the thermometers available) were far in excess of any internal nest temperature, and the nest temperatures measured above the maximum shade temperatures were doubtless due to the direct rays of the sun. It is thus possible to say that the nest structure partially protects the</page><page sequence="22">268 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monogaphs Vol. 8. No. 2 termites from the temperature extremes found outside of the nest. Cowles (1930) measured external and internal nest temperatures in the nests of Trinerviitermes trinerviformis in Natal and his table shows the same tend- ency in these mound nests. Subterranean nests probably follow the tem- perature cycles of the surrounding soil very closely and this feature may be considered one advantage of such a habitat. Although it is possible that there is some migration of termite workers and soldiers influenced by tem- I'm_~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~IA FIG. 8. South end of mounds of Arniterines ineridionalis. Photograph through the courtesy of G. F. Hill. perature variations within the nest (Holdaway, 1935) and between the nest and the ground, the queen is of necessity usually confined to the royal cell and the young nymphs are seldom found far from the center of the nest. Of probably greater importance than temperature is the control of hu- midity within the nest as compared to the extremes to be found in the ex- ternal air. No measurements of nest humidities have been made, but it is safe to assume that the occupied nests of the Rhinotermitidae and Termitidae have almost a saturated air humidity (See Cowles, 1930, p. 23). The reaction of these termites to humidity gradients (Williams 1934; Emerson, unpublished experiments) indicates that they move away from dry air toward saturated air and that they die from even a brief exposure to dry atmosphere. Species of the Kalotermitidae often show more toleration to dry atmosphere and also often do not move from dry air to saturated air when exposed to humidity gradients. It is this dependence upon saturated or nearly saturated humidity that is probably the most important reason why the rhinotermitids</page><page sequence="23">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 269 and termnitids are typically soil termites and, when above the surface of the soil, they typically construct nests and tunnels which maintain humid condi- tions not very different from the subterranean habitat. Slight differences in the moisture requirements between Reticulitermes hesperus Banks and R. tibialis p 'V I~~ A:L FIG. 9. Rain-shedding dirt-carton nest of Amnitermnes excellens. A wood-carton nest of Nasutitermes guaanae is visi- ble on the right side of the trunk Banks demonstrated by Williams (1934) make it reasonable to suppose that such differences may often de- termine the ecological distribution of the species. Even the desert termites, however, so control the humidity of the air surrounding them that they live in an atmosphere close to satura- tion. The case is different in the Kalotermitidae, however, and the ability of Cryptotermes, for example. to live in the wood of dry furniture is doubtless linked with a greater tolera- tion to dry atmosphere than is found in the species of Rhinotermitidae and Termitidae. Other factors that may be of some importance to termites are the oxygen necessities and the elimination of car- bon dioxide. Williams (1934) reports positive experiments upon these fac- tors. The ventilation pores in the nests of Apicotermes may function for the exchange of gases. It may well be that the elimination of carbon dioxide may determine the site of the nest to some extent. Soil heavily soaked in water or with the surface flooded would cer- tainly not offer a favorable site for a termite nest and the tendency to con- struct mounds and arboreal nests may enable termites to live in otherwise unfavorable localities. The termite literature abounds in references to the avoidance of light. The only definite orientation with response to light of which I am aware among termites is the photopositive reaction of the winged imagoes during the first part of the colonizing flight. I have myself reported (Emerson 1929) a "negative phototropism" of the imagoes before the flight starts and after it is finished, but more accurate experimentation indicates that the pho-</page><page sequence="24">270 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monorphs Vol. 8. No. 2 topositive reaction is only present for a short time and the insect is neutral to light at other times. This neutrality does not apply to heat and to in- creased evaporation, however, and the actions usually interpreted as negative responses are probably the result of these other factors which are so often FIG. 10. Detail of rain-shedding projections of nest of Amitermes excellens. closely associated with increase in the intensity of light. I should conse- quently not interpret the construction of nests or tunnels as the result of photonegative behavior. Another factor emphasized in the literature, particularly by Bugnion (1927), is the construction of the nests for the protection of the inhabitants from predatory enemies. It is certainly true that exposed termites form ready prey for wasps, ants, spiders, lizards, and other predators. Ants in particular have doubtless been enemies of termites for many ages and some species prey only upon termites (Wheeler 1936). Experiments as yet un- published indicate the ability of the soldiers to combat these enemies in com- parison with the defensive ability of the workers. The evolution of the soldier caste has doubtless been guided by the selection of efficient means of defense against predators and it is quite conceivable that the nest-building patterns have also been selected because of their value in protecting the col- ony from attack. I have never observed a direct influence of the presence of predators upon construction which cannot better be explained as a response to other factors, however, and I am of the opinion that any such direct re-</page><page sequence="25">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 271 sponse to ants as that postulated by Bugnion (1927, pp. 14, 30) needs critical verification. A few predators are especially adapted to overcome the pro- tection the nest affords. The modified forefeet of the spiny anteater, pan- golin, aard vark, and New World anteaters enable these animals to invade the hard nests of termites. The cylindrical sticky tongues of these phylo- genetically diverse mammals are astonishingly efficient in penetrating the complex system of cells in the termite nest. The prehensile tail, found in the tamandua, silky anteater, and some pangolins, enables these predators to reach the arboreal nests. The remarkable adjustments of these specialized termitophagous mammals only serve to emphasize the value of the nests as protection from general predators and indicate how strong the selection pressure was to influence the evolution of such striking convergent adapta- tions. Not only is the nest a protection against animal predators, but it is also a protection from harmful fungi. Laboratory colonies removed from nests often succumb to molds which seem to be effectively controlled under natural conditions. SELECTION OF THE NESTING SITE One might suppose that the selection of the nesting site involved no more behavior response than is found in seeds scattered by the wind. It is true that the flying termites scatter in all directions and a very large proportion alight in unfavorable locations. I have seen thousands entrapped in the surface of a river where fish were rapidly devouring them. I have seen thousands die of heat and evaporation on the hot sands of dunes. I have seen paired couples entering crevices in a wharf which was soon to be inun- dated by a rising tide. Certainly the mortality is high during the colonizing flight. On the other hand, the colonizing pair in Termes inquilinuv and T. fur would seem to select the nests of Constrictotermes cavifrons and C. cv- phergaster respectively for their nesting site and there are other indications that the imagoes are not wholly subject to chance. There is strong evidence that considerable powers of selection are manifested, not so much by the colonizing pair as by the workers after the colony has developed. The mi- gration of an entire colony of Nasutitermes costalis including the royal couple and many termitophiles has been reported (Emerson, 1929). The process of moving the nesting site will rarely be seen by human eyes, but migrations must be assumed when nests are found in locations where the royal pair could not have excavated their original cell. Such is the case for every nest of Constrictotermes cavifrong seen in the British Guiana forest (Fig. 14). These nests were invariably found on living trees with smooth bark, and in nine out of ten cases the tree slanted at an angle to the ground. The living bark was not invaded by the termites. The evidence seems convincing that all these nests were established through the migration of the entire colony. The uniformity of the nesting site in this species indicates behavior reactions</page><page sequence="26">272 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs Vol. 8. No. 2 of which we know practically nothing. How blind, rather small insects can select a tree with smooth bark rather than rough, the under side of a slanting surface rather than the upper, and then, after at least preliminary construc- tion by hundreds of individuals, stimulate the entire colony including the grossly physogastric queen to move to the new site, is difficult to analyze. It is not surprising that uncritical commentators fall back upon anthropo- morphic explanations of such facts. Especially in arboreal nests, height above the ground may be char- acteristic of the species or genus. Of the nests which I have studied in the New World, Nasutitermes costalis, N. ephratae, N. surinarnensis, N. wheeleri, N. accajutlae, N. corniger, N. pilifrons, N. guayanae, N. similis, N. coliztl- bicus, Constrictotermes cavifrons, Anoplotermes (Speculitermes) arboreus, Amitermes excellens and Microcerotermes arboreus build at varying heights from the ground. The last four species build dirt carton nests and the others build of wood carton. Other species seem to be limited to sites at most only a few feet above the ground, such as Anoploterntes silvestrii, A. banksi, A. brevipilus and various species of Termes and Arntitermes. Every gradation from these sites to subterranean locations may be found, but the range for each species seems to be fairly characteristic, although there may be con- siderable variation within each species. Nests may be built quite rapidly. A nest of Arnitermes excellens Sil- vestri was constructed about 50 feet from the ground on a tree near the Kartabo laboratory between September 15, 1919, and June 1, 1920. This nest was about 3 feet long, 1 foot wide and '2 foot thick. A colony of stingless bees had partly occupied the interior. I assume that the colony migrated to a new site in this case. Nests enlarged in proportion to the growth of the colony would doubtless grow more slowly. NEST DIVERGENCE WITHIN A GENUS It has often been observed that adaptive modifications are more conspic- uous as one ascends in the ranking of the animal group. Adaptations be- tween families are more obvious than between genera, and adaptations be- tween genera are more obvious than between species of the same genus. One explanation of this difference in different categories may be that genera arise through further speciation of adapted species, while less adapted species may not survive through the ages of competition. Striking adaptive divergence probably takes a long time under fairly strong selection pressure, while spe- ciation mechanisms may operate with slight selection (Wright, 1932, p. 363). If the mechanisms of evolution are operating to produce adaptive behavior in the same way that they operate to produce adaptive physiological inter- action and structural growth, we may expect to find this rule illustrated in the nesting behavior of termites. The general outline of family differences in nests has already been pre-</page><page sequence="27">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 273 sented. Many genera show similar nesting tendencies between various species, notably the dirt carton nests of Microcerotermes, the wood carton arboreal nests of most species of Nasutitermnes, s. str. (Figs. 3, 4, 9), the mushroom- shaped nests of Cubitermes (Fig. 11), and the perforated nests of Apico- termes. It is also possible to show striking divergence between the nests of species of the same genus, notably in the genera Nasutitermes, Anoplotermes, and Fic. 11.

I have selected the genus Amitermes as the best example known to me which illustrates such divergence as well as striking adaptive nest modi- fications. Amitermes is a genus found in every zoogeographical realm, but in gen- eral it is found in the tropics and only in the warmer portions of the tem- perate realms. As a genus, it seems particularly adjusted to dry regions, many more species being found in such regions as the southwestern semi- deserts of the United States than in the rain-forests of the tropics. The majority of the species do not build definitive nests above the ground which lend themselves to photography. Examples of such inconspicuous nests are those of A. beaumonti Banks in Panama, A. wheeleri (Desneux) in Texas, and A. santschii Silvestri in north Africa.</page><page sequence="28">274 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs Vol. 8. No. 2 A number of species, particularly in Australia, build mounds above the ground which may be conspicuous features of the landscape (Figs. 5, 6). Illustrations of such nests of Arnitermes are to be found in Hill (1922, 1922a, 1935), Froggatt (1905), Mj5berg (1920), Hegh (1922), Snyder and Zetek (1934), Emerson (1937a). It will be noted upon examination of these various photographs that there is a fair amount of variation in the shapes of the nests within a given species, but it is also obvious that charac- teristic distinction between the different species exists and in several instances the species may be easily recognized by means of the nest alone. From many viewpoints, the most remarkable nest known is that of A. meridionalis (Froggatt). This nest is the famous "magnetic" nest found in north- Australia (Figs. 7, 8) which is figured by Froggatt (1905), Hegh (1922), Hill (1922, 1935), and Emerson (1937a). Hill (1935) questions the determinations of the nests described and figured by Saville-Kent (1897, 1897a) and Mfjbberg (1920). The largest of the "meridian" nests are about 12 feet high with a north-south length of about 10 feet and an east-west width of about 3Y2 feet at the base in the middle. Hill (1935) gives the most complete and accurate account of the geographical and ecological distri- bution, the shape and orientation of the nest, and a discussion of the theories to account for the peculiar orientation. Hill states (private correspondence): I have thought that the probable reasons for the mounds being built with the long axis approximately north and south is to obtain the maximum total amount of solar radiation during the winter months, and the minimum during the heat of the day in summer. It would seem to me that the explanation probably will ultimately be found in the control of temperature, although theories placing emphasis upon humidity and wind have already been proposed. Not only is the explanation of the adaptive value of such a nest important, but a knowledge of the factors to which the termites are reacting directly would add much to our concept of nest evolution. Andrews (1927) and Dreyer and Park (1932) discuss ant nests of the genus Formica which are oriented with reference to light and give measure- ments of light and temperature. These ant nests have their broadest face toward the south and the most direct rays of the sun. The difference in the orientation of the nests of A. meridionalis may very likely be owing to their tropical location and possibly to the greater extremes of temperature to which they are subjected. In sharp contrast to the mound nests of the more arid savannahs, A. ex- cellens constructs nests on the sides of surrounding trees in the rain-forest of British Guiana. Galleries covered the entire trunk of a dead tree in an old clearing near the Kartabo laboratory (Figs. 9, 10). The tree was covered to a depth of about 8 inches and to a height of about 45 feet.

Upon breaking these projections they proved to be hollow and were always occupied by a few termites. The function seems to be for the shedding of rain water during heavy tropical showers.

When these structures are Arst started on the side of a tree, a long ver- tical covered gallery is built on the trunk, and side branches are built in a peculiar parallel arrangement inclined downward on the tree at an angle of about 450 to form a "herring bone pattern" (Emerson, 1937a, p. 246). The function of this construction is also probably the efficient shedding of rain which descends the tree trunk.</page><page sequence="30">276 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs Vol. 8, No. 2 CONVERGENT EVOLUTION WITHIN A SIMILAR HABITAT The adaptive significance of a modification is more convincing if it is possible to show that organisms from stocks not possessing the modification have separately evolved a similar adjustment when subjected to natural se- lection within a similar habitat. The function of the finger-like projections on the nest of Anitermes excellens becomes more clear if similar nest struc- tures appear in unrelated termites typically found in or near rain-forests. Convergence of rain-shedding structures may be demonstrated in three dif- ferent subfamilies of the Termitidae including the Amitermitinae already discussed. Without doubt these subfamilies had no common ancestor from which they could have inherited such a pattern. The Termitinae include several African genera which can be arranged in a series possibly illustrating an evolutionary sequence. Cubitermes often con- structs a unique mushroom-shaped nest (Fig. 11), the specific variations of which have been well illustrated by Sjostedt (1913), Hegh (1922), and Emer- son (1928). These nests show definite generic similarity but at the same time show specific differences. The majority are capped by an umbrella-like structure, convex on top and projecting outward at the periphery in such a way as to shed rain from the top of the nest. Finger-like projections, quite similar to those described on the exterior of the nest of Anitermnes e.rcellens, often extend around the edge of the cap. The nest of Cubitermnes subarqua- tus Sj6stedt (Fig. 12), found in the Congo rain-forest, deviates from the mushroom-shaped form found in more open country by appearing to be a succession of caps, one above the other. This nest type might easily have evolved from the mushroom type. The remarkable nest (Fig. 13) of a spe- cies from the Congo rain-forest, Procubitermes niapuensis Emerson, belongs to a closely related genus. The termites build a series of hollow, chevron- shaped, dirt-carton structures extending for some distance above the nest proper on the side of the tree trunk. Mr. Herbert Lang, who examined and photographed the nest, is of the opinion that the ridges function for the shed- ding of rain (Emerson 1928). In the rain-forest of British Guiana, still another nest exhibits rain-shed- ding modifications (Fig. 14). The species is Constrictotermes cavifrons be- longing to the Nasutitermitinae. The entire structure sometimes reaches a length of about 3 feet. It is attached for most of its length to the side of a smooth-barked live tree. A discussion of other features of this nest is to b2 found in the preceding pages. Pertinent to our present consideration is the series of solid, sharp carton ridges which extend over the surface of the nest and continue downward at an angle along the tree trunk at the sides of the nest. These ridges are also built some distance above the nest and form a series of chevron-shaped structures which remind one of similar structures in the nest of Procubitermes niapuensis (Fig. 13). In the case of the nest of C. cavifrons, however, the ridges are more numerous, are sharp and solid,</page><page sequence="31">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 277 and are built over the surface of the nest. The surface of the bark is cleaned of lichens and similar outgrowths between the ridges, and an open passage- way is left above the nest which allows ease of travel up the tree. I have observed the nest during a heavy shower and there is no question that the FIG. 14. Profile and detail of edge of nests of Constrictotermes cavifrons on smooth-barked slanting trees at Kartabo, British Guiana. Sharp, solid, rain-shedding ridges extend-above the nest on the tree trunk as well as over the surface of the nest and down the sides of the trunk. The termites have bridged over the ridges as they enlarged the nest (upper right). The hanging basal part of the nest (lower left) is composed of stored food and is occupied by the semi-parasitic termite, Termes in- quilinws. ridges deflect the sheet of water descending the trunk of the tree in such a manner as to keep the nest relatively dry and moistened only by the drops which fall directly upon it. Hingston (1932) describes this nest and arrives at the conclusion that the ridges "shoot the water forward and outward clear of the nest." My observations did not indicate that the water was "shot" outward, but that the stream was deflected to the side and ran down the trunk without wetting the nest. Hingston also describes an experiment in which he cut 18 ridges above the nest, allowing the water to run into the nest. He</page><page sequence="32">278 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs Vol. 8. No. 2 states that the water moistened and softened the earth carton of which the nest is composed. In the fourth week following the injury to the ridges, the termites started to repair and replace the ridges and had completed eight during the sixth week when the observations ceased. This experiment of Hington's is most interesting because it indicates that the termites may react to the percolation of the rain-water into their nest. DISCUSSION Because the insects in the experiment outlined above have successfully met an emergency, Hingston classifies this behavior as intelligence (also see Imms 1931, p. 16). A cut in the finger is an unusual event for the cells involved and adaptive clotting of blood followed by the growth of tissues reacting to complex factors result (Arey 1936), but the physiologist would hardly be inclined to say the reacting cells were intelligent. Such somatic physiological activity is known to be influenced by hereditary factors as evidenced by the genetics of haemophilia. The termite behavior recorded by Hingston seems to me to offer a significant parallel. Unless the nesting behavior be largely hereditary, there is no more phylogenetic significance in its evolution than in the evolution of human architecture. Human architecture seems to rest wholly upon a capacity for "conditioning" and intelligent response to environmental and esthetic factors. From the standpoint of behavior analysis, it is in sharp contrast to termite architecture. Both types of behavior, of course, may be of fundamental importance to the biological success of the species. The tendency to resort to anthropomorphic explanations is noteworthy in observers who are astonished by the remarkable complexity of termite life. Maeterlinck (1926, 1928) is especially prone to such generalizations. Bugnion (1927) and Imms (1931, p. 102) resort to the "lapsed intelligence" theory of Lewes with its Lamarckian implications to explain the origin of "instincts". All of the references to termite "intelligence" known to the author carry strong anthropomorphic connotations. Kemner (1929) has given a classification of the termite nests which he studied in Java and also discusses the systems of classification used by Holmgren (1906). In certain respects I find myself in agreement with Kemner's phylogenetic arrangement-namely in treating the kalotermitid- type nest as the most primitive and postulating the evolution of the rhino- termitid-type from the kalotermitid-type. In the arrangement of the phylogenetic sequence of the various types of termitid nests, however, I cannot agree with Kemner because the arrangement is opposed to phylo- genetic sequence based upon a study of the morphological characters of all the castes (Hare 1937). It would seem to me that all correlated evidences of phylogeny would have to be considered and certainly comparative morphology cannot be ignored, not because behavior or physiological characteristics are</page><page sequence="33">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 279 less important than morphological characteristics, but the significantly corre- lated characters which have been studied from a phylogenetic viewpoint are largely morphological at the present state of our knowledge. Without break- ing away from the deduced phylogenetic history of the major groups of termites, one may assume that the most primitive termitids were ground and log dwellers not differing greatly from the rhinotermitids in their nesting behavior. Many morphologically specialized termitids have not deviated much from this basic behavior type. Radiation, however, may conceivably have occurred in several directions leading to simple ground excavations, mound nests, fungus-garden construction, arboreal dirt nests, arboreal wood- carton nests, and other more specialized types, a few of which have been discussed in the preceding pages. It is not necessary to assume that any of the more basicly specialized termitid-type nests were derived from any other specialized type and there is much evidence against this hypothesis. Among certain closely related groups such as the species of Apicotermes and species of Cubitermes and Procubitermes, one may postulate evolutionary sequences which fit the morphological data, but a postulate that Microcerotermes-type nests evolved from Nasutitermes ( _= Eutermes) -types and that the fun- gus-growing behavior was an aftermath of the type of nest-building be- havior of Microcerotersmes seems to me wholly out of line with a con- siderable body of facts upon which the phylogenetic arrangement of these groups is based. The separation of analogous from homologous morphological structures through the maze of genetic modifications, physiological influences, growth patterns, degenerative changes, and convergent adaptations, is a difficult task. With increasing knowledge of connecting links and a better understanding of the principles of embryology and of evolution, we are enabled to rectify many of the mistaken conclusions of the past. However, in spite of the fact that the principle of homology has been applied to the evolution of termite nests, I think that the best available evidence is a parallel series of homologous morphological structures. Whether homology is assumed for structure, for behavior or for physiological action, it would seem to rest upon a similar genetic basis manifesting itself through successions of enzymic effects and physiological actions and interactions (Wright 1934, p. 33). That behavior may be dependent at times upon local chromosomal influences has been dem- onstrated by Whiting (1932) in his studies of the reproductive reactions in sex mosaics of the parasitic wasp, Hcabrobracon. I have cited one instance of degenerative evolution of nesting behavior in the case of Termnes inquilinus. Degenerative evolution of behavior may have occurred in numerous instances, but few cases are associated with suf- ficient data to justify a reasonable conclusion. Degenerative evolution is an example of a negative and usually non-adaptive directional tendency that has been a stumbling block for many evolutionary theorists. Modern ge-</page><page sequence="34">280 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs 280 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Vol. 8. No. 2 netics, however, has shown that mutations are often degenerative in their manifestations, that they may occur at statistically predictable rates, that species characters are usually an outgrowth of gene and chromosome combi- nations, and that natural selection is probably responsible for keeping wild populations from exhibiting degenerative tendencies of functional character- istics. "Mutation pressure" resulting in degenerative effects might produce a degenerative evolution if selection pressure for a particular structure or func- tion were removed (Wright 1929; Darlington 1936). Degenerative mutations would seem to have more effect in small interbreeding populations. Another positive influence has been postulated (Wright, 1929) in the probable fact that "each character is affected by many genes and each gene affects many characters" (Wright, 1934, p. 30). Thus selection probably does not act upon the single effect, but selects genes and gene combinations which result in a sum total of favorable effects. Consequently a gene or system of genes caus- ing degeneration may be selected for other beneficial effects, particularly if a former beneficial effect has been lost or decreased through a change in the environment.1 It is thus possible to explain known evolutionary trends on the basis of modern genetic theory without recourse to Lamarckism. Non- adaptive evolution is possible (Wright 1932, p. 363) and it is not necessary to assume adaptive value for every specific character. The multiple effects of genes also give a reasonable explanation of non-utilitarian vestigial struc- tures and recapitulative tendencies. Sudden complete losses of the hereditary basis of complicated structures would probably indicate such gross genetic changes that other vital functions would be affected. It is more probable under natural conditions that the old heredity has merely become overlaid by new heredity suppressing or modifying structures or actions (Wright 1935, p. 105). Needham (1930) emphasizes the opinion that "organs are only recapitulated in so far as they are necessary for the development of the ones which are required in the ontogeny in question, and all the other old ones disappear." Although recapitulative structures and actions may often have functions, it seems difficult to believe all cases are functional and Wright's explanation allows for the possibility of recapitulation of non-functional organs or actions. I have searched my experience and the literature for a case illustrating vestigial behavior among termites, but I am unable to offer a single instance which is worthy of consideration. In a sphere far removed from the insect world, however, I wonder whether the rather futile action of dogs in scratch- ing dirt following defecation may not be considered an example of behavior which has undergone phylogenetic degeneration, but is still visible as a vestig- ial pattern (see Enders 1935 for an account of specific differences in faecal behavior of Panamanian cats). 1 Wright, in commenting upon this statement, adds: "The type allele in each series is that which has the most favorable net effect on all characters. If one character loses in importance relative to others, there will be a shift in the alleles in many series with degeneration of the character losing importance as a consequence of the increased development of the others."</page><page sequence="35">April, 1938 TERMITE NESTS 281 The foregoing discussion emphasizes the phylogeny of inherited species behavior patterns, but I see no reason why individual behavior involving modifiability through experience (Emerson, 1933) may not be characteristic of termites. Such behavior seems to be relatively unimportant in the phy- logenesis of the species patterns discussed in this paper. Ranges of variation in the inherited pattern may also be demonstrated under identical environ- ments, and different environments will doubtless bring about variation in the patterns with the same heredity. A better understanding of the ontogenetic development of both genetically and environmentally induced behavior is highly pertinent. These problems await future investigation. SUMMARY 1. Termite nests may be used as examples of behavior evolution because they are morphological indications of behavior patterns, they express the be- havior of a population, the patterns are hereditary, there is a natural control over any Lamarckian influence, evolutionary sequences are available, adaptive modifications may be demonstrated, and coordination mechanisms may be partially analyzed. 2. Wood-eating roaches excavate galleries in wood but make no con- structions. 3. The Kalotermitidae excavate wood and construct partitions, indicat- ing responses to humidity and mechanical or chemical factors. 4. The Mastotermitidae exhibit a quantitative advance in nest construc- tion compared to the Kalotermitidae. 5. The Hodotermitidae show a further advance with subterranean nests, elaborate carton construction, and food storage. 6. The Rhinotermitidae have separately evolved subterranean adjustment and in some species show building activities in response to social factors as well as physical factors. 7. Excavated subterranean nests of the Termitidae exhibit the influence of mechanical and spatial factors. 8. Materials used for construction may be dirt, wood, or excrement, cemented by saliva or anal excretions. 9. Structures may include covered tunnels, roads, rain-shedding pro- jections and ridges, nests of characteristic size and differentiation, ventilation pores in the walls, stored food, and fungus gardens. 10. Sterile workers and nymphs of sterile soldiers and workers construct the nests in the Rhinotermitidae and Termitidae. 11. The ecological functions of the nest are control of temperature, con- trol of humidity, and protection from predators and harmful fungi, all en- abling the termites to live in otherwise uninhabitable niches. 12. The nesting site may be selected partly or wholly by the colonizing pair, but often is selected by the workers and is followed by a colony migra-</page><page sequence="36">282 ALFRED E. EMERSON Ecological Monographs Vol. 8 No. 2 tion. Height of the nest from the ground may be fairly characteristic of the species. 13. Different species within a genus show great divergence in nesting behavior. Species of the genus Amitermes have subterranean nests, mound nests, arboreal nests, nests oriented with reference to the sun, and rain-shed- ding constructions. 14. Convergent evolution of rain-shedding constructions has occurred in the Amitermitinae, Termitinae, and Nasutitermitinae. 15. A discussion of "intelligence," correlation of morphological and be- havior homologies, degenerative evolution and "vestigial" behavior is in- cluded. LITERATURE CITED Andrews, E. A. 1927.
