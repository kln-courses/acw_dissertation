<plain_text><page sequence="1">FREUD AND THE ILLUSION OF RELIGION J. E. TURNER The University of Liverpool, England ELIGION, being one of the most complex phases of human experience, has always provided a fertile soil in which luxuriant perversions have perennially flour- ished; and before these can be finally uprooted, they must be traced down to their deep and tangled roots. Recent psychology has undeniably vividly illuminated the structure of religious ex- perience, alike in its normal and its abnormal manifestations. This makes it all the more remarkable that Freud's latest analy- sis of religion, as such, should rest on so fragile a foundation that his criticisms must be ranked among the most puerile that have ever been leveled against their object. But the serious in- adequacies of his contention become still more radical when it is extended beyond religion itself, regarded as one main form of culture, to culture in general. This is excellently defined, to begin with, as "all those respects in which human life has raised itself above animal conditions and in which it differs from the life of the beasts."' Culture thus becomes inseparable from civilization; but immediately following this definition we find the fundamental error which distorts the entire perspective and vitiates Freud's final conclusions. For culture is next depicted as coercively imposed on the generality of mankind by "a minority that understood how to possess itself of the means of power" (p. io); while the necessity for this coercion arises from the ineradicable hostility between cultural demands on the one hand and natural human instincts on the other, since the latter are essentially "destructive and anti-social tendencies .... the majority is today hostile to culture."'2 But while these powerful and inimical tendencies are all too painfully obvious, nevertheless Freud's description violates The Future of an Illusion (London, 1928), p. 8. * Ibid., pp. i, 15. 212</page><page sequence="2">FREUD AND THE ILLUSION OF RELIGION 213 equally the facts of history tbgether with sound psychological principles; and this in two important respects. In the first place, we may agree that all human progress from the animal and savage level has been very largely due to certain small minori- ties. But to call their influence "coercive" is to verge on the ridiculous; quite plainly, on the contrary, their methods have consisted uniformly in persuasion and example, argument and exhortation, which with parallel and ghastly uniformity have been rewarded by the cup of hemlock, the stake, and the cross. Secondly, those other minorities which actually have resorted to coercion have been the despots and tyrannical autocracies, whose ultimate defeat has always been brought about by that very majority of mankind which Freud accuses of resisting and destroying culture. The fact is that he has totally omitted from his group of "instincts" those which are the most effective and at the same moment the most distinctively human: the instinct for freedom, shared by all animals themselves; for sym- pathy and co-operation, also found in social animal species; for art and knowledge, as these slowly but nonetheless irresistibly germinate in the crudest savage rites and superstitions. On each of these vitally significant issues, thqrefore, Freud's ac- count of human nature is as remote from actuality and as purely imaginative as Hobbes' familiar "state of nature." It is super- fluous to adopt any idealistic interpretation of the facts just referred to, since a frankly pragmatic criterion proves itself amply sufficient, in the long run, to justify man's preference for culture even when this demands the most rigorous control of his violent impulses and passions. Thus man discovers for himself the stern truth, rigidly imposed by Nature upon even the ani- mal mind, that there is always a limit to indulgence which it is ultimately fatal to transgress. Freud begins, then, with so radically perverted a presenta- tion of the facts of history and psychology as to suggest the dis- torting atmosphere of the consulting room, confined as this in- evitably is to abnormal types of mankind. It is not surprising,</page><page sequence="3">214 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION therefore, that as his argument proceeds it becomes involved in direct self-contradiction. For he concludes by insisting, with perfect truth of course, that "we have no other means of con- trolling our instincts than our intelligence"; still further, that though "the human intellect is weak in comparison with human instincts, nevertheless it does not rest until it has gained a hearing. Ultimately, after endlessly repeated rebuffs, it suc- ceeds."3 But it is plainly altogether impossible to attribute cul- ture to the coercion exercised by any minority whatever, and at the same moment to reason. To select either of these is neces- sarily to exclude the other. For reason is essentially non-coer- cive in any literal, and not merely metaphorical, sense of this term. On the contrary, reason is from its very nature a matter of individual deliberation followed by wholly voluntary deci- sion, choice, and action. It is quite true that this represents an ideal that is rarely, if indeed ever, attained, just as it is equally undeniable that imitation, example, and pragmatic standards are almost universally operative. But even these are themselves the indirect effects of reason in some form, so that at bottom reason and intellect remain absolutely antithetic to all modes of coercion; Freud's argument therefore, when carried to its conclusion, collapses completely through an inherent self- contradiction. This is in fact implied by the very cases to which he appeals. "Every child," he maintains, "becomes a moral and social being [because] external compulsion is gradually inter- nalized" in such a way that "people, from being the foes of cul- ture, become its supporters [and] dispense with external co- ercion" (pp. 18, 19). Now this "external compulsion" is said to hold true, of all possible instances, with respect to cannibalism. We are to suppose, therefore, that this originally universal cus- tom has practically entirely ceased because a small minority coerced their blood-thirsty, or even merely famishing, fellows into its abandonment! Surely serious criticism is wasted on so far-fetched a suggestion, particularly in view of the alternative 3 Ibid., pp. 83, 93.</page><page sequence="4">FREUD AND THE ILLUSION OF RELIGION 215 account of the origin of culture which Freud himself proceeds to offer; while it must further be observed that Westermarck asserts the direct contrary as to cannibalistic habits themselves. "It is," he contends, "an illegitimate supposition to regard the cannibalism of modern savages as a survival from the first infancy of mankind, or from a stage through which the whole human race has passed."4 But to return to Freud, we have just seen that his first theory is that culture is coercively imposed by minorities; his second is that "we united together and created culture" to guard ourselves against the "dangers with which nature threatens us" (p. 26). But it is patent that these two theories are hopelessly irreconcilable, since if mankind "united together and created culture" there can never have existed the asserted minority externally coercing the larger mass. Once again the very basis of Freud's entire standpoint is invalidated by its own internal contradiction; and this difficulty is intensi- fied when he further maintains that our "great common task [is] preservation against the supremacy of nature" (p. 27). We must ask anew, slightly modifying Tennyson's words, "Are men and nature then at strife?" a question which no biologist or psychologist will now answer affirmatively unless he first gives "nature" an altogether too restricted and antiquated a meaning. For in its wider and truer sense, is not man himself an essential part of nature? Is he not "organic to the Universe," as Professor Pringle-Pattison has argued? Here likewise ideal- ism is superfluous; it is amply sufficient to consider the most familiar and even commonplace facts. Are not, then, all human brain-processes as perfectly natural as those of the ape? and with these, their inseparably conjoined mental activities also? Scientifically, at least, the negative answer is clearly inadmis- sible; but this implies that "mental activities" must include even the rarest and finest cultures, which thus become as much part of "nature" as the thrush's song or even the cannibal's war cry. It is, in short, no longer possible to regard "culture" ' The Origin of the Moral Ideas, II, 580.</page><page sequence="5">216 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION as antithetic to "nature," as Freud has done here; on the con- trary, culture is simply nature herself raised to the highest level. This indestructible affinity between man and nature must, however, be extended still further. The criticisms of religion, on the ground of its perversions, are closely allied with those based upon its anthropomorphism, which Freud next proceeds to consider. But once more the objection destroys its own foun- dation. For, as has been pointed out repeatedly, not religious experience alone, but all human experience, must remain an- thropic. If therefore this is made the ground for calling religion an "illusion," then science and art and ethics at once become equally illusory; so that if, as Freud finally concludes, religion is merely a mirage doomed ultimately to fade away, whatever succeeds it must be as anthropic as itself. On this issue the modern theologian fully agrees with his philosophic prede- cessors; "man never knows how anthropomorphic he is," ob- serves Dr. Tennant; "knowledge can never soar above human interpretation";5 and similarly both Kant and Hume, while diametrically opposed in almost every other respect, are at one in recognizing the ineradicably anthropic character of every predicate, without exception, that the human mind can apply to the real Universe. Our sole choice rests therefore, not be- tween anthropomorphism and its absence, but only between its crudest types on the one hand and its most elevated on the other; so that if "science is no illusion" (p. 98), religion need not necessarily be one either. Curiously enough, this receives indirect recognition as Freud's argument continues. For he insists, and again with complete justification, upon the validity and objectivity of "scientific endeavor" despite (to repeat) its ingrained anthropomorphism; and his reasons are precisely those which I have already empha- sized. "Our mental apparatus has been developed in the at- tempt to explore the outer world; secondly, it itself is a con- stituent part of that world" (p. 97). But this being the case, it " Philosophical Theology, I, 175, 198.</page><page sequence="6">FREUD AND THE ILLUSION OF RELIGION 217 is quite illegitimate to restrict our "mental apparatus" solely to "scientific endeavor," since it functions equally naturally, and for all that Freud has thus far shown, equally validly, throughout aesthetic, moral, and even religious experience. Thus a twofold illogicality vitiates Freud's entire position: first, he sets up an antithesis between man and nature as "sub- lime, pitiless, inexorable" (p. 27) which is, however, forthwith discarded completely in so far as our "mental apparatus" is concerned; secondly, "mental apparattis" itself is arbitrarily limited to "scientific endeavor" alone, just as though the other main types of experience were totally devoid of such apparatus. Equally fallacious is Freud's description of those facts of ex- perience from which he affirms the illusion of religion to origi- nate. All cultural ideals, we find, follow upon actual achieve- ments instead of preceding these and, at least to some important degree, determining their character; while such ideals are re- tained because they yield narcissistic satisfaction (pp. 21,22). Here likewise we are offered a radically inaccurate account of the mental sequences involved; for, though it is true that every practical success immediately suggests further possibilities to the fertile human mind, it is much more vital to remember that both pure thought and imagination always far outrange the actual. The majority of modern appliances, for example, ex- isted first of all in the vivid imagination of their inventors, in precisely the same way that the figures of a fine drama are the offspring of their creator's imagination, no matter how much they may resemble persons in actual life or history. Now what is thus true of mechanisms and art applies equally to economics and statesmanship. In this respect, therefore, it is clear that Freud has quite unscientifically transposed the real order of the phenomena, since the proper function of all ideals and ideas is to provide those more or less definite ground plans, to which later practice conforms. Still further, if narcissistic satisfaction is the sole reason for their retention by social groups, it becomes im- possible to explain the transmission of ideals from nation to</page><page sequence="7">218 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION nation, and the unceasing supersession of ideals which all his- tory records. To select only outstanding modern instances, are we to suppose that ingrained narcissistic satisfaction with their previous attainments can explain the almost revolutionary adoption of occidental habits and institutions by Turkey, China, and Japan? Similarly remote from the actual facts is the treatment of "the dogmas of religion." According to Freud, these "claim to be believed firstly, because our primal ancestors already believed them; secondly, because we possess proofs, handed down from this very period of antiquity; thirdly, because it is forbidden to raise the question of their authenticity";6 and these assertions are applied, in the main, to "one phase of development which more or less corresponds to contemporary Christian culture" (p. 34). Who, then, are "our primal ancestors" to whose ac- ceptance the appeal is supposedly addressed? What "proofs" have been received from "this period of antiquity"? If the terms "antiquity" and "primal ancestors" have any definite meaning, they must denote beings not far removed from Eoan- thropus. But surely not the most extreme authoritarian would claim quite so venerable a lineage for his tenets as that! As for the third "claim," while there has always been a super- abundance of bigotry, still the more enlightened adherents of Christianity have welcomed inquiry even if they have also con- demned and (most unhappily) severly punished heresy. But precisely this circumstance has at least the advantage of dis- proving Freud's own initial contention. For such religious per- secution is an outstanding instance of that "external compul- sion," not now by a minority but by a majority, to which Freud himself attributes the advance of culture; its patent historical ineffectiveness, therefore, is in itself a complete refutation of his whole theory. But the most formidable difficulty attending his analysis still remains. Freud finds the primal basis of religion in the " Op. cit., p. 45.</page><page sequence="8">FREUD AND THE ILLUSION OF RELIGION 219 racial infantile helplessness which is so familiar a feature of psychoanalytic doctrine. The issues plainly extend beyond the confines of religion as such, and affect the validity of the entire Oedipus complex hypothesis. For once again the concrete facts of experience provide no support whatever for this theory, which rests indeed on the simple, but nonetheless fatal, fallacy of confusing the fact of childish helplessness with the child's own consciousness of its helplessness. The fact itself is plainly in- disputable, alike in man and in animals; but it by no means follows from this, nor does it ever actually occur on the univer- sal scale demanded by the Freudian theory, that either child or animal is directly aware of its own feebleness, as it clearly ought to be, no matter how vaguely, in order to account for the com- plex in question. This is easily established by both observation and experiment. The newly born creature, to begin with, is not definitely conscious of weakness or of anything else; and when awareness does arise, it is normally not the awareness of weak- ness at all. On the contrary, young animals notoriously exhibit unusual vigor, activity, and curiosity altogether foreign to any consciousness of helplessness, although (to repeat) this is their actual condition. This holds true of even such timid species as the frolicsome lamb and frisky rabbit, and obviously much more in the case of young Carnivora. Animals are therefore almost as unconscious of their physical deficiencies as is a mag- net of its own molecular constitution. It is well known that ani- mals unfamiliar with man will approach him fearlessly, exactly as young chicks and ducklings will roam quite freely so long as patent dangers are absent. These facts are wholly consistent with infantile responses to the parents' warning calls; for here likewise we are concerned with reflex or instinctive reactions which, ingrained for countless generations in the nervous system, are practically as automatic as the magnet's purely mechani- cal pointing to the poles. We have therefore only the slightest grounds, if indeed we have any at all, for supposing that the chicks sheltered by the parental wings are themselves conscious</page><page sequence="9">220 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION of their "state of helplessness," actual though this undeniably is. It must of course be remembered that we are dealing with normal conditions, not with the production of abnormal terror due to equally abnormal stimuli. Now what is thus normally true of young animals is also true, mutatis mutandis, of young children. In their minds also terror and the consciousness of feebleness-here again to be sharply distinguished from this itself-are produced only by abnormal cruelty and ill treatment, which are, on the whole, far rarer among savages than among debased and brutalized "civilized" families. That the normal healthy child is actually unaware of danger is only too familiar to all parents who have had to guard against their offspring's cheerful temerity in climbing ladders and fraternizing with large and fierce dogs. Psychologi- cal experiments bear this out by showing that childish fears are aroused only by definite, and once more, abnormal stimuli such as loud noise or the sudden loss of support. All this might indeed be theoretically anticipated, since it is patent that any con- tinuous and constitutional consciousness of weakness, such as Freud's theory must necessarily attribute to children, would be absolutely fatal to racial survival. Quite similarly, further, with the childhood of the race. Sav- ages, normally, are resourceful, brave, and even audacious. It is true that they may be terrified by quite abnormal influences, though even this is by no means the case universally; but again we are concerned with the savage's normal reaction to his fa- miliar environment; and here the parallel to children and young animals is precise. Unusual natural phenomena, such as eclipses and earthquakes, unquestionably arouse fear and awe; but apart from these events modern savages, like our most primitive ancestors, remain blissfully ignorant of their real feebleness, habitually and unthinkingly facing perils and accepting risks to which civilized man would quickly succumb. The entire Oedipus complex theory seems equally doubtful. For if we refuse to be hidebound by the neuroticism of the con-</page><page sequence="10">FREUD AND THE ILLUSION OF RELIGION 221 sulting room, we must ask the simple question, "How many children actually assume that relation to father and mother respectively which Freud claims to discern?" How many chil- dren, affectionately treated in the normal family, come to re- gard their fathers as intruders upon their relation to their mothers? How many actually cherish the "unconscious" wishes that Freudian theory demands? and how can that theory, modi- fy it how we will, be applied to the countless matriarchal so- cieties where the father is practically unrecognized? If, once again, we exclude inherited neuroses due to abnormal stimuli such as terrorism, the proportion becomes negligible; so that if at the same time we distinguish, as we must do, between the condition of infantile, or primitive human, helplessness on the one hand, and the consciousness of this condition on the other, the two theories of the Oedipus complex and of the conse- quent development of an entirely illusory religious experience are seen to be absolutely fallacious. In conclusion, it is impossible to plead that Freud's analysis of the phenomena, whether it is valid or not, is limited to their purely psychological aspects alone. For although (as I have admitted at the outset) these aspects are of crucial importance, it is just as illogical to restrict our consideration to them in the case of religion as in the precisely parallel cases of science and art. Investigation is compelled to pass beyond psychology and its allied fields of inquiry into the wider realm of philosophy, as scientists at least are fully prepared to admit. It is, further, quite unnecessary here to defend the historic series of logical arguments in support of religious beliefs extending from Plato and Aristotle to Hegel, not to mention living thinkers; it is sufficient to recall their existence, and to ask if it is seriously suggested that they are all nothing more than extremely com- plex manifestations of wish fulfilment? If so, we end where we began-on the verge of the sheerly ridiculous. But Freud treats the whole problem as if none of these great philosophers had ever uttered a single word on the subject.</page></plain_text>
