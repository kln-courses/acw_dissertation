<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SELF AS TEXT Uses of Autobiography in the Theatre (Animations as Model) Bonnie Marranca Many artists draw all their resources from themselves and continually reflect only their own image. Breuer's use of autobiography, however, goes way beyond a purely narcissistic approach; he is self-projected, not self- centered. By that I mean he situates himself in a social context, and what he writes in his plays relates to the world around him. It is the I in "the world," not the "I" in its own world. If the animations can be said to treat consciousness from three different perspectives, and I believe that they can, what Breuer develops throughout them is a highly skillful thematics of consciousness. To the extent that the animations function on an autobiographical level, Breuer-as-writer reveals his personal relationship to his art, and his feelings about being an artist. He does this not through the projection of an omnipotent "I" but through the personalities of animals who, instead of people, are the principal "characters" in the plays. The notion of "animation" refers to the life spirit (the soul) he gives them. (Here it might be worth considering Roland Bar- thes' distinction between "figuration" and "representation" of the author in the text, the former based on presence, the latter on description.) Drawing on the rich and popular historical tradition of the beast epic Breuer creates his own fables of contemporary life and manners, telling us in his own pun- ning fashion how the individual functions as a social "animal." These fables operate on at least two levels: metaphorically, they function as art 85</page><page sequence="2">about making art; mythically, they work to demystify stereotypical attitudes about malehood. Breuer's choice of animals is not arbitrary, but works as a kind of totemic classification. The natural activities of each animal's (horse, beaver, dog) life are made to coincide with human modes of feeling and perception in the context of the plays. In this way, the horse evokes feelings of freedom and romance, the beaver creates defenses, and the dog is caught in a master/slave relationship. All of the latter are metaphors for certain in- tellectual and emotional positions, and are played with on several levels. And at the same time, from the mythic perspective Breuer debunks the male prerogative of knowing who you are. The metaphoric and mythic fuse and interact contrapuntally in the narrative line of the texts, with the metaphoric inviting a partly psychoanalytic approach, and the mythic the more struc- tural. By using metaphors of animals instead of an identifiable self Breuer distances himself from his material, allowing him to take an ironic stance toward it which he does every chance he gets. The result is literally a cross between the irony of Kafka's fables and the hyperbole of the animated car- toon, by Breuer's own admission the two most influential sources of the animation concept. The literary conciet of the fable gives him complete freedom of expression while at the same time offering the protection of a mask. Breuer has devised his texts in such a way that they show the "eye" looking at the "1." It is from this perspective that the animations reveal, not facts of life, but aspects of existence. The use of autobiography, in the sense of the "self as text," is one of the characteristic features of current experimental theatre and performance art which in the seventies has been evolving new strategies for dealing with content. If theatre in the sixties was defined by the collaborative creation of the text, in recent years individual authorship has gained ascendancy; likewise, theatre in the sixties (and all offshoots of the Happenings, too) was outer-directed whereas now it (and performance art) is inner-directed: perhaps the shift can be said to be from the exploration of environmental space to the exploration of mental space, and from narration to documenta- tion. Following the current interest in America in a highly refined spiritual life and the evolution of new shapes of consciousness, the performing arts are actively redefining their own spirit: in both cases, the emphasis is on the dialogue with the self. The animations, in particular, show a conscious development of personal mythology, a tendency to be found in the plays of Richard Foreman and Spalding Gray, and the operas of Meredith Monk, just to name a few ex- amples. It seems more than coincidental that both Breuer and Gray refer to their work under the title of "trilogy" and that Foreman has evolved a "cycle" of plays with the same themes and characters. In my view this terminology reflects the authors' decided attempts to develop continuing self- histories-a fact which is not surprising because Americans have always defined themselves as individuals, not as a society or group. 86</page><page sequence="3">In a larger context Breuer seems to be following the mythopoeic strain in the American avant-garde (some examples: The Living Theatre, The Open Theater, Robert Wilson); for the seventies I think we can redefine this strain as "auto-mythopoeic." The Romantic self is very much evident in Breuer's animations and Breuer, whose oeuvre is based on the life of the spirit, is the most expressionistic, poetic (and literary) of his contemporaries. The animations are Breuer's memory of the past (documentary time) related in the present (narrative time), the temporal narrative lines fusing in a self- conscious consciousness. ANIMATIONS continues the American tradition of transcendentalism. Breuer animates his work with his own life spirit, the deepest part of his being. The part Charles Olson called the poet's "breath." It is this breath which gives life to the animals, and "animates" them so that they "become" human. Then Breuer's literary imagination takes over, letting all his feelings and perceptions loose in an idiosyncratic stream of con- sciousness that reflects a funky speechifying animal double. In this universe of words that each animal creates, poetry does its dance as a humorous intelligence. Caution: Breuer dances with two left feet. Breuer's fables are poems for pleasure; entertaining, intelligent, sensual, they are the work of a master ironist. Not to mention a closet esoteric-type who delights in pedagogical humor. In passage after passage of virtuosic uses of metaphors and metonymy, rhetorical devices, macaronic verse, neologisms, sound rhythms, and free associations on verbal and visual ideas, Breuer creates quite dazzling poetry. The animations develop a metalanguage that seems to make itself up as it goes along, surprisingly rich in its imaginative devices and lack of regularity. It is writing about writing. Breuer especially loves language in the context of the speech act. No wonder the animals are all compulsive talkers, forever going on about themselves. By telling their stories, they situate themselves in the world -"I speak therefore I am." The trilogy is really based on the art of storytelling, a vanishing form in the technological age which, as Walter Benjamin laniented, has substituted mere information-giving for "the ability to exchange experiences." (With what foresight Benjamin prophesied the information-giving nature of contemporary art!) Breuer's intention is precisely that-to offer experience in the subtle form of corrective comedy. It is not surprising then that his work takes the form of the aphorism so often; the aphoristic style lends itself to offering advice, relating a moral, or commenting satirically with the intent to inform. Breuer's pithy remarks on the state of human affairs are all the more com- ical coming from the mouths of animals who appear hopelessly and helplessly human in their predicaments. (Like Kafka's mouse Josephine fussing about the relationship of her art to her audience.) And what wonderfully intelligent creatures these animals are, with their liberated word play, delight in crisscrossing verbal and visual puns, and witty circumlocution. The puns, especially, emphasize the circularity of speech, the result being that ideas and images can be extended virtually infinitely, 87</page><page sequence="4">the verbal interacting with the visual not only in pure madcap fun, but often in highly sophisticated associations. Robert Pincus-Witten identifies a California sensibility in the proclivity toward punning, a fact which is not far-fetched when one considers that Breuer grew up in California and keeps in touch with the West Coast scene. In a more personal vein, he reflects the laid back tone of Californians and their playful attitude toward art and ar- tifacts. The pun is the most dominant rhetorical device in the animations. From a dramatic point of view the most distinctive aspect of the anima- tions is the complete lack of dialogue. Even though other figures may ap- pear (B.BEAVER, SHAGGY DOG) or be referred to (RED HORSE) in the plays, neither discourse nor conflict between characters is dramatized at any time in per- formance; that is to say, performers do not relate to each other in perfor- mance. Think for a moment about the implications of a drama that doesn't dramatize anything: it means that the dramatization of a conflict on stage, the conventional (and even unconventional) definition of drama is com- pletely undermined. My own feeling is that the continued emphasis on the life of the spirit (the holistic approach to life, the integrated personality) and the turning away from rationalist thought may lead us in time-though not the foreseeable future-to a drama which is not based on conflict. Breuer's animations are the touch of a suggestion of this direction. Breuer's radical conception of dramaturgy disregards the conventional uses of plot, dialogue, setting, time, and character in favor of an open- ended form that has the shape of the prose poem. The idea of passages in a life is substituted for plot, in place of dialogue he puts the monologue, in- stead of setting he develops the notion of personal space, memory takes over for dramatic time and, as I have already pointed out, the chorus takes the place of the individual character. Breuer's use of chorus is not thematic or information-giving, as is usually the case, but works as the structural backbone of the animation, reflecting his conception of character in the drama: polyphonic voices substitute for the individual voice. Through the device of the chorus the narration evolves from several perspectives in the metonymic functioning of the actors; the notion of gender doesn't exist, nor does any separation between the past and the present. And, as in Oriental theatre, the voice is separated from the character. The actors as it were take turns enacting events from the animal's life rather than imitating them. Interestingly, Peter Handke's "Sprechstfcke" also feature choruses ("speakers") instead of individuated characters, a musical approach to text, literary ready-mades, and the lack of dialogue. But the important difference between Breuer and Handke is that the latter creates works which have no visual orientation, while Breuer is interested in motivational acting (the emotive gesture) in highly imagistic settings. Notwithstanding, Breuer and Handke share the distinction of hav- ing created a few of the most provocative texts for the stage in the last decade. Yet, the animations are as free-flowing and personal as the "Sprechstidcke" are schematic and objective. The poetic monologues that comprise the 88</page><page sequence="5">animations lend themselves to expressivity because they are temporarily unrestricted. The monologue seems to work for Breuer as the natural organizer of his lyrical outpourings. From the perspective of autobiography, the monologues function as mediators of the unconscious. If as Jacques Lacan observes, "the unconscious is the discourse of the Other," then it is the place where Breuer talks to himself. Though the monologue is the unifying structure of the plays, Breuer relates his fables in a variety of ways. His is not story theatre, however, which is illustrative, but epic theatre, a dialectical one. Extending Bertolt Brecht's ideas about epic acting, the chorus, the autonomy of each theatrical element, and the narrative aspect of the performing space itself, Breuer tells his stories not only literally but musically, filmically, elec- tronically, sculpturally, spatially, diagrammatically, kinetically, photographically, chromatically (not always in the same animation, of course)-all of them functioning as different and autonomous kinds of "writing" in the grammar of the event. Breuer refers to this technique as "tracking": it simply means the laying down of parallel lines of narration. In this way, the background and all elements of staging comment on what the performers, who theatricalize states of being, say and do. In Breuer's nar- rative strategy all space is semantic; everything in it emphasizes its con- ception as "writing." These approaches to narrative link Breuer no doubt with Brechtian aesthetics, but there are other theatrical parallels as well. Perhaps the most obvious influence is Samuel Beckett (by way of James Joyce) whose use of narrative and the monologue, and treatment of consciousness, is un- mistakably a presence in the animations. (Breuer's understanding of Beckett is fiercely evident in his brilliant stagings of PLAY, COME AND GO, and THE LOST ONES.) One can also see affinities with the work of Gertrude Stein, particularly her emphasis on consciousness and the continous present, the lack of dialogue, stage directions and individualized characters in her plays, and the announcement of sections of a play within the play itself. This aphorism of Stein's seems profoundly descriptive of the formal ar- rangement of Breuer's plays on the page: "A sentence is not emotional, a paragraph is." In a more contemporary American context, Breuer aligns himself with the poets' theatre of Frank O'Hara and Kenneth Koch in their integration of art theories in drama, and the mixing of popular and classical literary forms; theirs, however, is a much more literary approach to theatre than Breuer's. Closer to Breuer's own manipulation of language is that of Sam Shepard; both writers love to play with the "attitude" in various styles of American vernacular speech. Coincidentally, the two (characteristically "California" artists) reflect the liberated poetic style of the Beats, their romanticism, and their interest in musicalizing literary texts. These theatrical and dramatic lines, and modern literary tradition appear side by side with the strong currents from the art world which inform the animations. From RED HORSE to B.BEAVER to SHAGGY DOG one can trace, 89</page><page sequence="6">respectively, a movement from minimalism to process art to super-realism in the execution of the texts. They also connect with the emotional attitude of abstract expressionism (isn't that a style that makes emotion "formal"?), pop art, and the more recent story art (John Baldessari, Bill Beckley, William Wegman), and to a greater extent, the punning and ready-made con- cepts that descend from Marcel Duchamp, and which are refashioned in the more contemporaneous art of Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, and Bruce Nauman. Finally, and not the least important, as a sophisticated con- ceptual theatre Mabou Mines has a long history of collaborating with ar- tists on their productions (Tina Girouard, Jene Highstein, Gordon Matta- Clark); no other theatre group in America can make this claim. (An odd con- tradiction in Mabou Mines' position vis-A-vis the art world is the fact that while the group is so art-oriented, art world people haven't given them full recognition because they tend to dislike the attempt to use trained per- formers, preferring instead the untrained.) What is remarkable about the creation of the animations is their ability to accommodate the most contemporary styles of art with theatrical history and literary tradition, in a form derived from the cartoon! Breuer is among the very few gifted playwriting talents in the post-absurdist theatre. That is quite startling when one considers that he is generally thought of as a director rather than as a playwright, nor are the animations seriously talked about as plays-by the press or the public. THE RED HORSE ANIMATION The first play of the trilogy, THE RED HORSE ANIMATION, is a romance which offers an outline of a narrative, not a complete story, in a tripartite struc- ture: outline, lifeline, storyline. The different lines are not exactly structurally harmonic, but three related approaches to the play. The outline, however, remains the structural basis of RED HORSE, and the lifeline and storyline merge after its prologue. The story purposely fragments the sense of time beginning as the play itself acknowledges, somewhere in the middle. As a narrative mode which derives its aesthetic from the comic book, it clearly tries to "frame" (to ar- rest) certain moments in the horse's life, without constructing a chronological order. The first third of the play is a taped prologue which suggests the words of a narrator talking out loud as if in a daydream, but when the actors enter the performing space at its conclusion, they take over as both the metaphoric and anthropomorphic image of a horse. They perform the piece for the most part lying down on the performing space which, in painting terms, refers to a canvas, and to extend the allusion fur- ther, aligns itself with the abstract expressionist technique of emotionaliz- ing space-the process I referred to earlier as Breuer's formalization of his own emotions. When the actors take over after the "voice" grows silent, they evolve a 90</page><page sequence="7">choral narrative, each one speaking for the horse. This choral structure reflects the division into three parts of what is really the interior monologue of the only "character" in RED HORSE, the most isolated, inner-directed world-and the most Beckettian in its intense study of con- sciousness-depicted in the animations. The play follows the logic of the dream world where the narrator and his idea of a horse become a unified being expressing real emotions. When this happens the outline begins to animate itself. WHEN THE HORSE BEGINS TO CONSTRUCT A HISTORY OF HIMSELF, HE EVOLVES A TOPOGRAPHY OF THE SPIRIT ROMAN NUMERAL TWO . IN WHICH I THINK I SEE MY SHAPE . This desire to know the landscape of his body-in the sense of both physical and mental ter- rain-is the compulsive drive of the horse in this journey play of sorts. The narration of the play is linked to the recognition of form so much so that it is spatially organized, developing in its movement a definable geometry of emotion. Form, shape, circle, line: these are the repeated terms of the horse's attempt to trace himself in space. (Coincidentally, these forms reflect the iconic vocabulary of minimalism which has strongly influenced this work in its technical approach.) In the emotional world of RED HORSE space functions in the form of codes for actual states of being. A circle, therefore, isn't simply a roundness but has to do with circularity in the on- tological sense. 91</page><page sequence="8">When the narrator in the prologue talks about diagramming an outline in blue pencil he draws a knot; with a red pencil he draws a line between some numbers and the shape of a horse appears. Reflecting on his spirit he sees a map, he starts "mapping" consciousness. Now the significance of the play's spatial organization becomes clearer. Travel and distance function not only as literal ideas, but as symbolic and psychological codes, too. (Travel as a journey to "inner space" and in the sense of covering "aesthetic" distance.) When the horse begins to construct a history of himself, he evolves a topography of the spirit. In an autobiographical context, the obsession with form suggests that the narrator is struggling to discover his identity and style as an artist. I'M CHANGING . WHAT AM I . The theme is intricately woven, on the one hand, with the metaphor of freedom and adventure the horse represents and, on the other, with the horse's domestication. These conflicting feelings are pur- posefully confused in parts of the story but coalesce in a dream sequence which features a scene between father and son. The idea of RED HORSE is that it is about fragmentation and contradictory feelings even as it evolves, if only temporarily, as a romance. The story seems to me full of indecision, ambiguity, doubt, reversing of positions and the sense of impermanence; so much of the intensity of its "presentness" has to do with its singular focus of an artist, somewhat anguished, trying to find himself yet still having a sense of humor about it (if only as a defensive measure). RED HORSE does not develop a singular dramatic line (it has three) but offers a variety of narrative approaches in ad- dition to the spatial narration. The story is also told filmically, diagram- matically, musically, metaphorically, Chromatically. These different nar- rative modes do not always synthesize but work in counterpoint, as do the play's themes and images, in a deliberate discontinuity of codes. DO I OWE A DEBT TO THE CINEMA? the horse asks (Capital Letter A), wondering about what may have influenced him; at the same time RED HORSE itself "thinks" filmically. ELEVEN . SEVEN . GENGHIS KHAN INSTITUTES THE CRAFT OF DELIVERY . BY HORSE . CUT . PAN OF THE GOBI DESERT . CUT . The "film" depicts the romance of a Mongolian steed, simultaneously uniting the narrator's romantic childhood memory of a film shown in grade school and his sub- conscious adult feelings about losing his freedom (being domesticated). The horse image has both positive and negative denotations which carry conflicting iconic and symbolic messages. The horse undergoes a further symbolic transformation in the section which appears as the exposition of a conflict between father and son. One of the more lyrical passages of RED HORSE, this section finds the horse look- ing at his reflection in a stream-a pun on the "stream of consciousness"--and remembering his father, Daily Bread, in a dream that flashes by like a movie in his head. One of the reasons why Breuer's autobiographical writings don't remain at the solipsistic level --this scene especially demonstrates why-is his ability to objectify himself: the horse looks at himself in the stream and a third self looks at the horse looking at 92</page><page sequence="9">THE HORSE IMAGE HAS BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE DENOTATIONS WHICH CARRY CONFLICTING ICONIC AND SYMBOLIC MESSAGES the reflection. At the core of the dream, and here the horse experiences an epiphany, is the horse's disapproval of his father's obsession with work and making money; the rejection of a bourgeois life style (his father's "domestication") in favor of the bohemian insecurity of an artistic one (his own). If Daily Bread was into "bread" (money) and "circles" (treadmill of success), his son is into "lines." But in which direction do they point? And what are they saying? In the pastoral setting of RED HORSE (B.QEAVER and SHAGGY DOG are urban pieces) the scene is almost elegiac. If the romance is the traditional form for the wish-fulfillment dream, Breuer subverts the logic of its conventions so that it works in opposition to the outcome of the play. The horse never finds a form he can hold onto but wanders frustrated, goes back to the beginning of the story, and finally loses his sense of self. DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL ROMAN NUMERAL SIX . At the end of the story the horse can no longer keep himself together and his im- age begins to fall apart into space. The narrator's dream is over, and the grim realities of self-doubt come crashing through the frame. THE RED HORSE ANIMATION is Breuer's most poetic, subdued, and reflective work. 93</page><page sequence="10">THE B.BEA VER ANIMATION In his second animation Breuer introduces B.Beaver, a Job-like figure strug- gling to build a dam which will secure his house and family. He HAS LOST THE ART OF DAMNATION AT A CRUCIAL TIME B.Beaver tells, in his six-chapter story which moves from the statement of his problem to its resolution. While RED HORSE exists wholly in the mind of the horse, B.BEAVER recounts the past; and, unlike the brooding horse, the beaver is a compulsive, stuttering car- toon, the most comical of Breuer's creations. The story is divided into "text" and "takes." The text is the actual nar- rative by B.Beaver who acts as a chorus leader while the others he refers to (the brood and the missus) function as a chorus; but whether they are the beaver's mental projections or real family members is not clarified in the text-the beaver is telling his own story. The chorus amplifies aural and visual images of the text with the takes serving as Breuer-as-writer's self- conscious comments on it. The text relates to the past, the takes to the pre- sent. The "I" of the story is seen from the perspective of "he" in the takes. These takes are introduced into the story as literary allusion (B.Beaver is aligned with another comic TURD in dramatic history-Ubu Roi), pop allu- sion (to the animated cartoon voice of M. MAGOO), free association (on LATIN as related to language and a Puerto Rican social club), cartoon and visual cues (THE DAM COLLAPSES . CURTAINS FLAIL . YIKES . EXPLODES ACROSS THE FRAME . ); the text serves to detail character and interpret mood and attitude, too (the last take goofs on the cliches of a sentimental soundtrack). This emphasis on process has greater significance in the thematic organization of the play itself; in fact, it is its subject. B.BEAVER is a story about not being able to write, or, being afraid to let writing happen. It is a metaphoric explication on the theme of "writer's block," cleverly disguised in a hilarious story whose lovable hero is a beaver trying to construct a dam (a defense mechanism) so he and his family won't wash away when the snow melts in the Spring. B.Beaver stutters for a very good reason-he can't get the words out. Stuttering is emblematic of his creative problems. In the punning universe that defines B.BEAVER, you're "damned" if you do, "dammed" if you don't. The beaver creates all sorts of distractions to deny his creative urge. He gets sidetracked on pedagogical thoughts about geological formations, writes a postcard with a request for "how to" books on building dams; floating downstream he daydreams happy thoughts of escape, twirling his tail around a tree branch he hangs upside down contemplating his dilemma. In one of his fantasies he finds a waterlogged craft and pretends he is cap- tain of a ship, mixing nautical and boxing language for a pun on the idea of creativity. B.Beaver has his serious moments, too; swimming past some workers along the brook bank, he observes: LOOK AT THEM ... EAT . CRAP . SCREW . CROAK . He refuses "death on the installment plan." 94</page><page sequence="11">The observation has more than pictorial ramifications because it ex- pands upon the important section from RED HORSE which explores the philosophical differences of father and son. Here again in the second part of the trilogy the opposition to the banality of the workaday world surfaces. It seems to me that the narrator hasn't resolved the conflict between want- ing security for his family, but not wanting to trade the insecurity of the ar- tist's life for a dreary bourgeois life-style. Though family-centered plays have traditionally dominated American drama, this has not been the case in experimental theatre. An exception to this generalization is the animations which feature as an important theme the acceptance of parental respon- sibility: central to the trilogy is the conflict between a writer wanting to feel free to follow his creative impulses while at the same time wanting to fulfill his responsibilities as a father. As subject matter in an avant-garde context this is pretty rare. (On the other hand, that Breuer is one of the few people in the avant-garde theatre who has a family easily accounts for his concerns.) Not surprisingly, two of the animals he chooses to tell his stories are "domesticated" (horse and dog), the third is involved in defending his home (beaver). If on the metaphorical level B.BEAVER acts as a fable about the artist, on the mythical level it demolishes myths about the male "animal" in society. The beaver is continually constructing defenses, and experiencing anxiety and fear about his impulses. He is hiding behind the dam and the desire to keep his family together, afraid of his own creative responses to the world around him. Breuer distorts the portrait of the artist as a confident young man conquering new creative territory for himself. The story of the uptight beaver is told in a variety of ways that mix Latin, naval language, and cliches with the argot of sports, science, meteorology, algebra, and biology. The different kinds of speech express the frequent transformations in states of mind experienced by the beaver. The imagery, too, reinforces the play's psychological themes. The most obvious symbol is the dam which, stationary, holds back the creative flow and, washed away, lets creativity come gushing forth. There are other images more tied to nature which, in the deeper structure of the story, become a metaphor for artistic struggle as one of survival against the elements (the beaver hunts salmon instead of the white whale, though). The snow, this massive pure blankness, is a "block" which when thawed will let the creative juices flow, while water itself is the temporary setting for the beaver's floating dreams. In the scheme of things is it any wonder that after the winter and with the coming of spring, the beaver makes his breakthrough? Breuer's use of symbol rests fairly traditionally in his radically-conceived play. One of the joys of Breuer's writing is its sensual quality. SHAGGY DOG is the animation about sexual attitudes, but B.BEAVER has its own special erotics. When the beaver is finally on the verge of accepting his creative impulses he grows excited sexually and has an erection: he prepares "to come" into his own as an artist. In this way writing is associated with orgasm on the 95</page><page sequence="12">ON THE MYTHICAL LEVEL [B.BEAVER] DEMOLISHES MYTHS ABOUT THE MALE "ANIMAL" IN SOCIETY A METAPHORIC EXPLICATION ON THE THEME OF "WRITER'S BLOCK," CLEVERLY DISGUISED IN A HILARIOUS STORY WHOSE LOVABLE HERO IS A BEAVER 96</page><page sequence="13">physiological level, and with the building of a structure, on the physical. (Regarding this last point, the notion of creating art as making a work-physical labor-is very much in the vocabulary of contemporary ar- tists in all fields, as if they feel the need, as Americans in a country which values manual labor and devalues artistic labor, to justify their activities as work.) In THE B.BEAVER ANIMATION Breuer has created a very sophisticated car- toon about being a writer: a genuinely funny, self-effacing work that proves how unpretentious an artist Breuer is. The sort who would stub his toe on a statue of the muse. Breuer's witty union of sexual and intellectual humor in exaggerated settings construed to emphasize human foibles make him the Groucho Marx of the American avant-garde. THE SHAGGY DOG ANIMATION Breuer's gifts as an imaginative writer create a striking presence in THE SHAGGY DOG ANIMATION. Now, in this animation, five times longer than any other, he creates the space for his soul to sing. The voice belongs to a dog called Rose, and sing she does-a torch song about her man that got away. The story of a filmmaker/dog Rose, SHAGGY DOG is a bittersweet soap opera with a cast of characters who include, besides Rose and another dog Broadway, a rabbit, Bunny, and two humans, John and Leslie, all of whom appear in a series of adventures that unravel in California, Las Vegas, and New York. It is a love story that makes fun of love, mocking its illusions, pain, sentimentality and foolishness, while acknowledging its supreme ecstasy. Sounds like the definition of "puppy love." SHAGGY DOG is all reflecting surfaces, electronic perfection, artificial emo- tion: romance as fabricated in movies and sung about in popular songs. To get at the craziness of his subject Breuer musicalizes the text in perfor- mance, using different kinds of musical styles for the "attitude" they em- body, so that SHAGGY DOG becomes at times talking rock, with all sound filtered through the sophisticated stereophonic equipment that manipulates the voices of nine performers who speak for Rose in solo, trio, and choral form. I don't wish to deal with performance per se-that's not my focus here-but it is necessary to know the basic set-up of the play tp understand Breuer's canny remark to an interviewer: "You can't Say 'I love you' anymore without an echo chamber... [it] has captured the myth of the expression more clearly than the human voice." Music so dominates con- temporary notions of romance that people identify experience with the musical theme it suggests to them. Rose tells John in her special idiolect: HOW LONG . HAD I LONGED . TO SING THE SONG . THAT PLUGGED YOUR PRONG . INTO MY SOCKET . AND THERE IT WAS . SWEETS . KINKY REGGAE . SHAGGY DOG is the perfect piece for the disco age. Slick, controlled, stylish, and synthetic. It has to do with performance: in the sense of the per- forming self, and in relation to definitions of metatheatre. In the world 97</page><page sequence="14">Breuer creates characters act out ideal romantic images of themselves in a glossy setting decorated with the gadgetry of a technological society. Never mind a Saturday night fever, Rose is in heat. The play's slickness characterizes avant-garde theatre now, as opposed to ten years ago when technology wasn't so prominent in it, and the more advanced theatre had a homemade, "poor" quality. SHAGGY DOG is "rich" in more ways than one: it represents more sophisticated theatrical concep- tualization as well as more money available for experimentation. The move- ment from RED HORSE (minimalism) to SHAGGY DOG (post-minimalism) has been to progressively more color and technological equipment. In SHAGGY DOG style is subject. A "Love Story" for the avant-garde, SHAGGY DOG is based entirely on the cliches of romance as it is depicted in popular mythology, and propagated by the mass media. When Rose and John make love on a California beach A WAKI LUA LANI KALOA KALUA MOON surfs over them; John (a filmmaker himself) creates cinematic illusions of his affairs with Leslie (I REMEMBER ONCE PRO- JECTING A PLACE IN THE SUN ONTO LESLIE). Not only are there puns on and allu- sions to songs and film (these are used throughout the production), but to television (Kojak is on Rose's "telly") and to consumer products (A HOBART 700 SPEED QUEEN DISHWASHER sits in her kitchen). It's the in- nocence of pop art updated in the detached cool of super-realism: a "California" (in sensibility and in place) love story according to pop culture. SHAGGY DOG takes the form of an extended "Dear John" letter from the nar- rator Rose (a puppet as well as a dog) to John (her owner) in which she reflects on their relationship which ended three years ago (twenty-one in the dog's cycle). It works itself out in a binary structure of "sound track" in which the actual narrative unfolds (the subjective line) and "image track" in whi6h the text comments on itself (the objective line), the two tracks together evolving as a fugue. The story itself is basically very simple though it -takes an incredibly cir- cumlocuitous path to its unraveling-it is a shaggy dog story: prologue (a kind of radio play which takes place before the image track appears in the text); Part I in which Rose recalls the high points of her love affair; Part II in which John and Rose break up; Part III, three years after the affair. The animation follows virtually a classical narrative line: a heroine comes to know the truth about herself by going through a series of meaningful ex- periences. Of course, these experiences are not dramatized, only recalled by Rose. In essence, Rose moves from feeling I WAS THE DIMENSION OF THE SHADOWY SPACE FROM ONE SHOE TO ANOTHER (her first meeting with John) to MY LIFE HAS CHANGED . IT'S TAKEN A TRULY INWARD TURN . MY FEELINGS HAVE BECOME THE FACTS ... AND OUTSIDE I FELT SO PROFOUND I CONTROLLED THE WEATHER (Rose has an epiphany in the snow) to GOODBYE . DEAR . I SAID . AND SANK INTO THE NIGHT LIKE A PIECE OF BACON IN THE BOWL OF SPLIT PEA SOUP (the corny simile wonder- fully props up Rose's cool resolve to go her own way). By the last few pages 98</page><page sequence="15">of the play Rose has become fully militant, quoting Lautr6amont's MALDOROR in a passage about dogs who break their chains and run madly through the countryside, unable to control their new-found freedom. SHAGGY DOG traces the movement of the soul toward liberation; in Rose's case, the development of a feminist consciousness. A work I don't think would have been possible without the influence of the women's movement, SHAGGY DOG is a mature feminist statement of remarkable metaphoric and philosophic richness. It demonstrates the awakening of consciousness in a series of ironic events that are both humorous and profoundly moving and, even more significant, it reflects a movement away from the more self-absorbed earlier animations to a much broader social context. Yet, there is much more to SHAGGY DOG than the contemporaneity of its feminism. As an artist Rose acts as a metaphor for Breuer's own feelings about being an artist. But she is also a puppet, physically manipulated in performance by performers (male and female) who are in turn manipulated by a sound system, a concrete allusion to her emotional manipulation by John (the image track studies the problem as it relates to the MECHANISM OF ATTACHMENT). As an abstract idea the puppet refers to the aesthetics of Bunraku which is an art based on the idea of storytelling through music, and furthermore, a theatrical mode which separates the narration into three separate "tracks" as it were: singer, puppet, manipulators. A WORK I DON'T THINK WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE INFLUENCE OF THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT 99</page><page sequence="16">And just as Rrose (a Rose is a Rose is a Rose) Selavy represents Duchamp's feminine nature (even as a name "Rose" has mythological status), so she is emblematic of the narrator's view as expressed in the clich6s of an oppressed minority, a view encompassing both androgyny and metamorphosis. This very special Rose is a dog owned by a master-the metaphor for the narrator's perception of the artist enslaved (owned by) the art world. Metaphor is clearly the organizing principle of the animations, more complexly in SHAGGY DOG than the others, because here metaphors are doubled in Rose's status as both dog and artist. SHAGGY DOG EVOLVES A STYLE WHICH I THINK OF AS "QUOTATION ART" The real coup of SHAGGY DOG is that Rose is so believable as a human being and artist, in a narrative that offers the multiple perspectives of the "I" who tells the story and the "they" who comment on it without involving them as writers. The irony of the image track keeps the reader from falling into the sentimentality that the story is constantly bouncing off of in the sound track. To make matters more complicated in this already beautifully complicated story, there is also a film metaphor to suggest that SHAGGY DOG is a movie that John and Rose are separately evolving in their heads. John (a shooter) and Rose (a cutter) get confused as to who's in who's scenario. Early on in the story Rose comments: ME AND MY MOVIE . WE WENT INTO PRO- DUCTION . ALL MY LINES CAME TRUE . It came together for Rose and John in Venice. With Leslie off making a commercial, they wander off to the beach, make love and dream in a scene which depicts the most total convergence of animal and human species in the animations. Here is a sample of Rose's poetry: 100</page><page sequence="17">WE'LL PICK UP DISEASES . AND FOAM AT THE MOUTH AND GET THIN AND CIVILIZED LIFE WILL SHUN OUR KIND . THEY'LL CALL OUT THE CATCHERS. BUT WE'LL ESCAPE . PAST SANTA BARBARA . PAST SAN LUIS OBISBO . PAST GORDA . SPECIAL PEOPLE WILL AID AND ABET US . ROMANTIC PEOPLE. THEY'LL BLOW KISSES FROM SPORTS CARS AND BECKON US TO THEIR BEACH BLANKETS WHERE THEY'LL TOAST OUR HEALTH IN A TEQUILA SUNRISE RIGHT OUT OF A THERMOS . This passage includes all of the most characteristic features of the animation in general: cliches of popular romance, parodistic humor and im- agery, motifs of Romanticism, California sensibility, poetic language, fan- tasy. Alas, back in civilization love starts to fade and Rose and John drift apart. Sick with grief Rose overeats, throws temper tantrums when John is with Leslie, takes a new lover, Bunny-all of the things humans do to compen- sate for a broken heart. But by the end of Part II Rose no longer needs John and she leaves him on a New York street at 4:00 a.m. while they're out for a walk. Rose is liberated, now it's John's turn to suffer. Breuer creates a tour de force scene in Part III which shows a distraught John, now a "puppet" himself, simultaneously dialing John's Anonymous and a girlfriend: WHAT CAN I DO . I GO INTO MYSELF . I BECOME SELF INVOLVED . I TRY TO BE SELF EFFACING . BUT THAT'S SELF DEFEATING . I INDULGE IN SELF RECRIMINATION . BUT ALL THAT DOES IS MAKE ME MORE SELF CENTERED. Breuer is relentless in this satirical "closeup" of John which makes fun of current self-help jargon and reverses the position of the male in the rela- tionship. Meanwhile, Rose is on the sound track admitting that she misses John: even with age (Rose is now twenty-one years older) one never loses illusions about love. SING ME A CHORUS OF CHERRY PIE ... I TELL YOU THE TRUTH . ONLY SLEEPING DOGS LIE . Rose ends SHAGGY DOG quoting a song and a clich6 -the twin foundations of a love relationship. SHAGGY DOG evolves a style which I think of as "Quotation Art": bolstered by the ironic stance of the artist' it is a way of creating art from the cliches and conventions embodied in the intellectual and emotional patterns of a given society. Quotation Art embraces the literary ready-made, a narrative strategy not without its striking examples here and in Europe. Peter Han- dke's "Sprechsticke" come readily to mind with Robert Wilson's A LETTER FOR QUEEN VICTORIA which took much of its language, not from officiatese, max- ims, slogans, and advertisements as Handke did, but from television pro- gramming, and Sam Shepard's TOOTH OF CRIME whose dialogue is filled with the argot of the rock, sports, crime, and business worlds. In each of these examples artists have taken the vernacular of their society and turned it back on itself-Handke for political purposes; Breuer, Wilson, and Shepard for more mythic strategies. The idea of Quotation Art is that it is an art rooted in signs: it moves all imagery and language in multiple directions, with the signifier continually becoming the signified. SHAGGY DOG transmits Breuer's ideas about the ways in which the individual is socialized (pro- 101</page><page sequence="18">THE PERFECT PIECE FOR THE DISCO AGE-SLICK, CONTROLLED, STYLISH, AND SYNTHETIC grammed) by his/her internalization of popular mythology in a series of dif- ferent codes (aural, symbolic, iconic, musical, linguistic, etc.) by which culture functions as a language. Claude L6vi-Strauss's definition of the creation of myth from the "re- mains and debris of events ... odds and ends ... fossilized evidence of the history of an individual or a society" is provocative in this context. Mythical thought as "an intellectual form of 'bricolage.' " If anything, Breuer's quotation of certain American mythologies is a recycling of the junk of an advanced technological society to create a form which acts as a critique of that society. SHAGGY DOG is love among the ruins. SHAGGY DOG works at the level of critique because it satirizes, instead of simply mocking, popular culture, a position which reinforces its moral underpinning. (Conversely, Theatre of the Ridiculous, a style also built on the cliches of popular culture and its entertainments, doesn't work as criti- que because it always remains at the level of parody; it becomes nostalgic, campy.) Though the piece plays with schlock imagery, Breuer's critical in- telligence keeps it from becoming kitsch. 102</page><page sequence="19">The morality of form I think is clear in the spatial poetics delineated in Rose's living quarters, and which is identified in the image track. For exam- ple, the bathroom is identified as the place of pride; the kitchen is the scene of hate; the den is the seat of power. Working with the notion of behavior in a particular space Breuer designates special areas for the "sins" lovers commit. While Rose is making creme puffs (one of Breuer's idiosyncratic puns) in her kitchen, the image track, guided by the voices of the speakers, is telling her: DON'T LAUGH ROSE . THE WORD IS . HATE . "Interior decoration" is equated with Rose's state of mind. Functioning in this way, the rooms go beyond being environments and move toward the concept of theological space. If SHAGGY DOG isn't quite a "divine comedy," it is a comedy of man- ners with a moral persuasion: a parable in the manner of Kafka. Though Breuer probably didn't have topoanalysis (Bachelard's term) in mind, it seems likely his ideas about the behavioral aspects of space were influenc- ed by the artist Gordon Matta-Clark who worked on part of SHAGGY DOG's design. In any case, this sensitivity to behavior and space is a concern one can trace in the work of such artists as Vito Acconci, Bruce Nauman, Robert Smithson, and Mel Bochner to name a few, while at the same time being another example of Breuer's familiarity with current art theory. Rose's own sojourn into the art world-she does it because she has to support her litter (here again the theme of parental responsibility that runs through the animations)-is humorously chronicled in Part I of the play. Now she satirizes art, patrons, critics, and grantsmanship: I LEARNED TO SHAKE HANDS . PLAY DEAD . AND BEG . TWO WEEKS LATER I PICKED UP A CAPS GRANT . While these lines follow on the sound track, the image track, which relates to it both contrapuntally and analogically, puns on SEE YOURSELF AS A HEAVYWEIGHT as Muhammed Ali's physical measurements are listed. This is typical of the way the humor of the piece grows out of the eccentric wed- ding of metaphors in the two tracks. And in this case, the way humor plays with the imagery: THE SCENE OF YOUR BOMBER JACKET DRAPED ON A PRESTO LOG . IN A FIELD OF LEFTOVER RAVIOLI . COURTESY RAUSCHENBERG . Much of the fun of SHAGGY DOG rests with the reader's capacity to understand its references which they can only do by being part of a certain society or group. The link is anthropological. Rose soon tires of the "sub rosa" tactics of the art world and decides to leave it; for her, it's an act of liberation. It is no surprise that Rose is the only one of the animals in the animations who has a name; she is the only one with a clear idea of her selfhood. In an autobiographical sense, the anima- tions move from RED HORSE, which has to do with self-definition, and B.BEAVER, with the acceptance of creative impulses, to SHAGGY DOG, which portrays an artist with a clear idea of self and art. In other words, a shift from self criticism to a criticism of the system that represents a ten year development in the consciousness of a writer. THE SHAGGY DOG ANIMATION brings together all the techniques and themes of the trilogy in a work of 103</page><page sequence="20">.... ......... =ii I " i a 4E".` .................. ........... . . .....-... ... ......... .. .. 1.... rNo ------- lIPNN 67 . ~MIR " ~. . . . . . . . . . ...l Waobw' i i qso .... ....</page><page sequence="21">stunning lyrical beauty and depth of perception whose authenticity of emo- tion is quite extraordinary. In the animations Lee Breuer has created a language that only the anima- tions know and whose narrator is known only to them. It is the language of an imagination at once seductive, witty, eccentric, and enormously aware of how writing prompts thinking. The animations reject a bourgeois value system based on the demands of a consumer culture and the dramaturgy it creates to reflect itself. And they reject the notion of a reader consumed by the text in favor of one who can collaborate in its making by allowing another "culture" to grow from it. The result is writing that provides space for the imagination to play in, in the play each reader imagines.
