<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANNUAL MEETING OF SUBSCRIBERS. THE Annual Meeting of Subscribers to the School was held in the Rooms of the Society of Antiquaries, Burlington House, on Tuesday, November 6th, 1928, LORD CRAWFORD AND BALCARRES in the Chair. The Chairman of the Managing Committee, Mr. GEORGE A. MACMILLAN, presented on their behalf the following Report for the Session 1927-1928 :- The Macmillan Studentship.-The Committee have great pleasure in reporting that the Chairman has just endowed the School with a Studentship of the value of l200oo a year, normally tenable for two years, with the possibility of extension for a third year in special circumstances. This further proof of Mr. Macmillan's generous devotion to the best interests of the School calls for a most cordial expression of the Committee's gratitude, which will be endorsed by all friends of the School. The Committee feel sure that this Studentship, which will appropriately bear the donor's name, will not fail to achieve its principal object, namely, to secure as students of the School a succession of picked men, who will be able to stay for two sessions at least and do advanced work. It will thus provide a welcome revival of the type of 'long-period ' student who did so much for the welfare of the School, especially in the field of excavation, before I914-a type which has become all too scarce, owing to changed conditions, in the last ten years. Fuller particulars as to qualifications and the conditions of tenure will be announced in due course. Changes on the Committee.-In December 1927 Mr. M. S. Thompson relinquished his duties as Hon. Secretary owing to pressure of business, and the Committee appointed as Secretary of the School Mr. W. R. Le Fanu, who is also second librarian of the Hellenic Society. The Committee feel that this additional link with the Hellenic Society will be of great advantage to the School. The Committee regret to report the resignation of Mr. R. C. Bosanquet, who was Director of the School from 1900oo to 19o6 and for many years past has represented the Hellenic Society on the Committee; Mr. M. S. Thompson has been appointed Hellenic Society representative in his stead. The place of the late Dr. Hogarth has been filled by Miss W. Lamb. 299</page><page sequence="2">300 BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS. [I927-1928 Director.-The Director spent about nine weeks of his leave in England, during which he spoke at the Annual Meeting of the School on the results of the fourth season's excavations at Sparta, and gave a lecture to the Glasgow Branch of the Classical Association, summarising the four campaigns on that site (1924-27). He also completed his annual accounts of recent discoveries for the Hellenic Journal and the Year's Work, as well as the proofs of his con- tributions to the Annual. He reached Athens in mid-November, after breaking his journey for a few days in Rome, which enabled him to revisit the Sister School. With the exception of a few one-day excursions in Attica, and one to Aegina, he did not leave Athens until April. During the session, in addition to his usual administrative and advisory duties, he delivered a few informal lectures in the Epigraphical Museum, spoke at an Open Meeting of the School, and gave much time to editorial work for the Annual, especially in revising the paged proofs of vol. xxvii. His own studies included the completion of his article for B.S.A. vol. xxviii. on Sir Wm. Gell's Asia Minor journey and the inscriptions found during it, and the preparation of a paper for the Hellenic Journal on some fragments of Attic Fifth-Century Treasure-Records. He also added finishing touches to the text and illustrations of a long article for the Papers of the British School at Rome, which he had practically finished in 1922. on unpublished objects from excavations at Lanuvium by the late Lord Savile. His reports on the Sparta excavations of 1927 were not finally completed until after he had left Athens at the end of the session. In view of his promised contributions to the final publication of the Orthia Sanctuary, he cleaned, identified and catalogued the coins from that site in the Numismatic Museum at Athens, and whilst at Sparta collated the texts of the inscriptions, numbering about 150, and prepared the numerous new facsimiles required for an exact publication, as well as working over the architectural terracottas with Mr. W. S. George's notes and supervising the making of water-colour drawings of the principal pieces by Mr. De Jong. He also whilst in Athens contributed with the Committee's approval a short article to a Greek Encyclopaedia on the history and organisation of the School. As the Assistant-Director was absent in Macedonia until the middle of April, the Director could not leave for Sparta until April 21st, which enabled him and Mrs. Woodward to see more than is usually possible of the Easter visitors to the School. The work at Sparta, referred to above, detained him for six weeks, with a short interlude in the form of a visit to the site of the Sanctuary of Apollo Hyperteleates and to Monemvasia, and he returned to Athens via Arcadia and Olympia, visiting en route the sites of Tegea, Mantinea and Bassae, and examining the architectural terracottas in the Museums of Tegea, Dhimitsana and Olympia. During the rest of the session, in addition to completing his accounts and collecting material for his archaeological summaries, he found time to</page><page sequence="3">ANNUAL MEETING OF SUBSCRIBERS. 301 finish part of his excavation-report for the Annual, and-during the last week before leaving-to examine again in English for the Ministry of National Economy, an exacting task of which he would gladly be relieved; and was engaged up to the last moment in correspondence and negotiations concerning the sale of the School's plot of vacant land to the American School, as stated below. He finally left on July 2Ist for a much-needed holiday, which enabled him to continue, amid fewer distractions, his work for the Annual and other publications, including the present Report. Assistant-Director.-Mr. W. A. Heurtley did not return to England after the session, but stayed in Athens during August, revising his article for the Annual, and travelled in Greece during September, visiting Ithaka among other places. He was in residence during October, except for a visit to Navarino as one of the delegates to the Centenary celebrations; from this journey he returned by way of Modon, Coron and Kalamata, after visiting Messenian Pylos. On December 8th he went to Salonika to work on his finds from Bou- bo6isti, and thence by train to Constantinople to study prehistoric pottery in the Museum, returning after fifteen days. He stayed in Athens until he left to begin his excavations in Chalcidice on March 8th, of which an account is given below, and was back in Athens by April I6th. In May he travelled for a fortnight in north-west Greece, exploring the shores of the Gulf of Arta and visiting Janina, Dodona, Preveza and spending two days in Professor D6rpfeld's hospitable quarters in Leukas. Whilst in Athens, in addition to his normal duties in regard to the Hostel and the Library, he was occupied with the proofs of his Vardar6ftsa report and with work on his finds from Boubouisti and the report incorporating them. He also spoke on the latter excavation at an Open Meeting, and arranged a representative collection of Macedonian sherds in the National Museum. In the second half of July he formed one of a small party which ascended Mt. Olympus, and thence crossed westwards into Epirus via Elassona, Mt. Smolika, Samarina and Janina, and so home by Preveza; and in mid-August left for a holiday in central Europe. The Archaeological Curator at Knossos.-Dr. Mackenzie reached Knossos in the last week of February, the crossing from Piraeus lasting about five days, as a result of an abnormally severe storm. He resided continuously until the end of his term of residence, August 15th, and assisted Sir Arthur Evans in supervising the works of reconstruction at the Palace described below, and in conducting visitors round the site. Students.-There was a gratifying increase in the number of students as compared with those of the previous session, no fewer than ten having spent the prescribed period of three months in Greek lands; their names are followed by those of students who stayed for a shorter period, including two former</page><page sequence="4">302 BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS. [1927-1928 students who returned for purposes of special study. The Committee are glad to see that students are making use of the facilities now offered by the Villa Ariadne for study in Crete. Mr. Oliver Davies, B.A., Exeter College, Oxford, Craven Fellow, spent some eight months in Greece, devoting his time to a study of ancient mines and of the sources of ancient metals, especially in the earlier periods. In Greece he explored Crete, the Argolid, southern Euboea and the mainland opposite, southern Thessaly and parts of Macedonia; outside Greece he visited for the same purpose Cyprus and the mines near Constantinople. From these visits he collected material which will be analysed chemically in England, and should yield important results by comparison with other analyses of ancient metal made elsewhere. By systematically collecting sherds, where present, from these mining areas he obtained in many cases valuable chronological data for the period in which the industry flourished. Mr. P. J. Dixon, B.A., Pembroke College, Cambridge, Craven Student, left England early in October and spent a month in Berlin and Munich, thence travelling to Athens by way of Constantinople. In addition to visiting the principal sites of mainland Greece he visited Cyprus, made a short stay in Egypt and spent a considerable time in Crete, where from the hospitable base of the Villa Ariadne he explored the western end of the island and examined many sites of the archaic period. His work in Athens was mainly devoted to acquiring a general introductory knowledge of archaic art. Mr. A. L. McMullen, B.A., St. John's College, Cambridge, who had graduated in the School of Architecture, reached Athens on February 25th, and undertook a study of Byzantine forms and construction, with special reference to brickwork decoration. He worked systematically at the subject for three weeks in Athens and five in the Peloponnese, paying special attention to the churches at Mistra, in Maina and at Monemvasia; but after a short visit to Constantinople was taken ill at Salonika and had to undergo an operation for appendicitis, which compelled him to leave unvisited the churches of Mt. Athos and southern Serbia and to return to England as soon as convalescent, in July. Mr. J. D. S. Pendlebury, B.A., Pembroke College, Cambridge, who had been elected to the School Studentship (offered again to Cambridge, which had been unable to appoint to it in the previous session) but generously surrendered the emoluments, chose as his subject the relations of Egypt and the Greek world down to the XXVIth Dynasty, with special reference to finds of Egyptian imports on Greek sites. After visiting the principal sites and Museums in Greece proper he travelled in eastern Crete in February and again in May, and assisted Mr. Heurtley throughout his excavations in Chalcidice in March and April. Whilst in Crete he worked in the Candia Museum, and at the Villa Ariadne he enjoyed the hospitality of Sir Arthur</page><page sequence="5">ANNUAL MEETING OF SUBSCRIBERS. 303 Evans and the advantage of his advice as to lines for further study. He returned to England late in May, to work up his material, and intends to return to Greece and Egypt before the end of the year. Mr. C. A. Ralegh Radford, B.A., Exeter College, Oxford, spent four months in Greece, after visiting the principal museums in South Italy. His special subject being the prehistoric cultures of N.-W. Greece, especially in the later Bronze Age and the earlier Iron Age, and their relations to the cultures of Italy and the region north of the Balkans, he travelled in N. and N.-W. Greece and Macedonia, helping Mr. Heurtley at his excavations, and visiting the museums in the regions investigated. Professor W. D. Woodhead, M.A., Oxon., Professor of Greek in McGill University, Montreal, spent three months in Greek lands visiting the principal sites in Attica and the Peloponnese, and making a long stay in Crete, where he spent ten days at Knossos and then accompanied Mr. Dixon on the tour in western Crete described above. The Committee note with special pleasure the steady continuance of the practice of Classical teachers from Canadian Universities staying at the School during vacations or leave of absence. The women students were as follows: Miss Sylvia Benton, Girton College, Cambridge, who had already had the advantage of visiting Greece on two previous occasions, spent a considerable time in travelling over less frequented routes both in northern Greece and the Peloponnese, and visiting little-known sites. Besides assisting Mr. Heurtley at his excavations, she spent some time studying ancient routes and fortifications, visited the principal museums of the Greek mainland, and also made a trip to Leukas and Ithaka. Miss Margaret Rodger, B.A., Somerville College, Oxford, holding the School Studentship for the session, reached Greece in the autumn and left in March. Her travels included trips to Delphi, to the Argolid, and to eastern Crete, and when in Athens she devoted her time more to historical than to archaeological studies. Miss Hilda White (Mrs. J. D. S. Pendlebury), Newnham College, Cambridge, Senior Classical Mistress, Bridlington High School, spent eight months in Greece, during which she travelled to the more important sites, and accompanied Miss Rodger on her journey in central and eastern Crete. Whilst in Athens she devoted some time to studying early red-figured vase-painting, besides getting a general acquaintance with the chief contents of the museums. Miss Vivian Whitfield (Mrs. H. T. Wade-Gery) came out in November, on leave from the University of Reading, holding the Bryce Studentship from the University of Oxford, a Fellowship from Lady Margaret Hall, and a grant from the Ireland Trustees, to study in particular the Art of Sparta and its historical implications, and worked at objects of Spartan provenance in the National</page><page sequence="6">304 BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS. [1927-1928 Museum in Athens, and in the Sparta museum. She devoted some time also to other archaic works of art, visiting the museums of Delphi, Chalcis, Corinth, Olympia, Tegea and Candia. The following were admitted for shorter periods: Mr. Ian Gallie, Exeter College, Oxford, holding the Clarke Studentship, who spent three weeks in Greece in the Easter vacation, but owing to poor health at first had time for only a little travelling, during which he managed to visit Eleusis, Sunium, Delphi, Corinth and the Argolid. Mr. W. G. Hardy, M.A., Toronto, Associate Professor of Classics in the University of Alberta, accompanied by Mrs. Hardy, spent six weeks in Greece in the early summer, and carried out a well-planned programme of visits to ancient sites, including a trip to Crete. Mr. H. W. Jacobs, B.A., Wadham College, Oxford, came for some six weeks from the Roman School, and studied archaic and fifth-century sculpture in Athens, Delphi, Chalcis and Olympia, paying special attention to works attributed to Ionian schools. Miss M. I. Turnbull, of Dunedin University, New Zealand, spent nearly ten weeks in Greece, arriving in November. As her purpose was to obtain a background for the study and teaching of Greek history and literature, she visited various ancient sites and museums, and in addition made a short trip to Constantinople. The following were re-admitted: Mr. R. P. Austin, Assistant-Lecturer in the University of Birmingham, who spent the Easter vacation studying the various small objects found in his excavation at Haliartos in 1926, and divided his time between Athens and Thebes, with a journey to the site to verify copies of the inscriptions found there. His report will appear in vol. xxviii. of the Annual. Miss W. Lamb, Honorary Curator of the Classical Antiquities in the Fitz- william Museum, who spent two short periods in Greece working at her book on ancient bronze statuettes, also devoted some time both in Athens and Sparta preparing for the Annual a study of the chief bronze finds from the excavations on the Acropolis and at the Orthia Sanctuary. Others who resided on various occasions in the Hostel during the session were-Dr. A. Boethius, of the Scandinavian Institute in Rome, Mrs. Brill and Miss Edminson, of the British School at Rome, Professor V. Gordon Childe, Mr. and Mrs. William Miller, Miss Gisela Richter, Mr. G. A. D. Tait, and Mr. C. R. Wason of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Visitors.-The School was visited, especially during the spring, by a gratifying number of friends, old and new. The Chairman of the Committee,</page><page sequence="7">ANNUAL MEETING OF SUBSCRIBERS. 305 accompanied by Mrs. and Miss Macmillan, revisited Athens after a long interval and paid several visits to the School; Sir W. M. Ramsay, disappointed by an accident of his intended journey in Asia Minor, studied in the School library; Professor R. M. Dawkins, on his way to Rhodes and Cyprus, stayed a fortnight with the Director. Other welcome visitors included Lord and Lady Dawson of Penn, Sir Herbert and Lady Samuel, Mr. Edward Hutton, Mr. H. B. Walters, Mr. W. H. Woodward, Colonel T. Gordon, who as grandson of one of the heroes of the War of Independence found much to interest him among the Finlay papers, Dr. and Mrs. T. Callander, of Kingston, Canada, and Mr. A. S. Burn. Receptions were given by the Director and Mrs. Woodward to two parties of the Hellenic Travellers' Cruises in April, which included the Warden of New College and Mrs. Fisher, the Master of Emmanuel College and Mrs. Giles, the Headmasters of Clifton, Plymouth College and Sedbergh, Dr. T. R. Glover, Professor E. S. Forster, Professor J. Harrower, Canon the Hon. E. Lyttelton, Professor M. T. Smiley, Mr. A. S. Bolton, F.S.A., Mr. and Mrs. Leonard Whibley, Mr. and Mrs. A. W. Pickard-Cambridge, Dr. W. A. Wigram and Mr. Willoughby Gardner, F.S.A. Open Meetings.-An Open Meeting was held on March 5th, at which the Director described the Sparta excavations of 1927, and Mr. Heurtley those conducted by himself at Bouboi'sti. A special Open Meeting was also held on March 13th, in the hall of the Greek Archaeological Society kindly lent for the occasion, at which Sir Arthur Evans gave an account, illustrated with slides, of 'The southern and western Approaches to the Place of Knossos in the light of Recent Discoveries.' A larger audience than could have been accommo- dated in the Library of the School was thus enabled to enjoy this important communication. Publications.-Volume XXVII of the Annual was duly issued to sub- scribers and others in the spring of this year, and, having regard to the limita- tions of space imposed for the sake of economy, may claim to maintain worthily the high standard of former volumes. Volume XXVIII is now in the press, and will contain, in addition to excavation-reports on Sparta by the Director, papers by Professor Droop and Miss Lamb respectively on the Laconian Pottery and the Bronze objects found in recent campaigns on the Acropolis at Sparta; the second instalment of the Director's publication of Sir Wm. Gell's travel- diary, excavation-reports by the Assistant-Director and Mr. Cuttle on pre- historic sites in Macedonia, the second part of Mr. R. P. Austin's Haliartos report, and Mr. Forsdyke's report on his excavation of the Mavro Spelio cemetery at Knossos. The Committee's decision to proceed with the publica- tion in book form of the final report on the Orthia Sanctuary has been quickly followed up by the kind offer of the Hellenic Society to publish it as a Supple- mentary Paper of the Journal of Hellenic Studies uniform with the Phylakopi report; and it is hoped that several of the chapters will be ready for press early next session.</page><page sequence="8">306 BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS. [1927-1928 The appearance of the second volume (in two parts) of Sir Arthur Evans' Palace of Minos touches the work of the School at so many points that an allusion to it here seems in every way appropriate, and the Committee wish to take this opportunity of congratulating the author on carrying this unique work one long stage nearer to completion. Excavations.-The Committee having acceded to the Director's request that instead of embarking on a new excavation he should be allowed an oppor- tunity of working at Sparta on the finds in the Museum, with a view to the preparation of his contributions to the Orthia book and to further reports on his own recent excavations, no substantive excavation was carried out by the Director this year. Actually he found it necessary to employ a few men for about three weeks clearing up fallen earth and making one or two small tests at the Theatre, as well as taking steps to underpin a dangerously overhanging portion of the outer retaining-wall of the cavea. A few men were also employed at the Orthia site in levelling and cleaning up the arena, where there had been falls of rubble from the exposed foundations. In so doing three inscriptions came to light, one of which was a fragment of a stele dedicated by a boy victor, and another was a complete columnar statue-base inscribed with the name of a victor in the ' Contest of the Whips,' and dating from ca. A.D. 200. A little of the early votive deposit was also cleared, but yielded no finds deserving special mention, nor any evidence modifying the conclusions drawn by the excavators twenty years before. As foreshadowed in last year's report, it is not proposed to carry out any further excavations at Sparta, but it must be emphasised that much still remains to be done in the local Museum if a really satisfactory publication of the finds from the last four years' excavations is contemplated. The possibility of the Museum being considerably enlarged is far from remote, and this would give an opportunity for a much more adequate display of its contents; in any such rearrangement the School would in duty bound offer its active co-operation. The Committee hopes that excavations may take place next session at the Hyperteleatic Sanctuary in S.-E. Laconia; and it is anticipated that before long it will prove possible to inaugurate the systematic exploration of some site or sites of the archaic period in Crete. For such an undertaking the Villa Ariadne would, of course, form, either directly or indirectly, the excavators' headquarters. Prehistoric Sites in Chalcidice.-Mr. Heurtley continued his programme of the systematic exploration of prehistoric sites in Macedonia, choosing for work in 1928 (I) a small mound at Molyv6pyrgo (the ancient port of Olynthus) and (2) a large ' Toumba ' at Hfgios Mamas, twenty minutes south of Olynthus. He had to assist him Miss S. Benton and Messrs. J. D. S. Pendlebury and C. A. Ralegh Radford, students of the School. Mrs. Heurtley was in charge of the cooking and other domestic arrangements throughout. Work began on March 12th, a fortnight being devoted to each site. Whilst excavating the</page><page sequence="9">ANNUAL MEETING OF SUBSCRIBERS. 307 second site the party had as neighbours in the village of Myri6phyto the American expedition under Professor David Robinson of Johns Hopkins University, engaged in excavating the site of Olynthus, and wish to record their indebtedness to him for various acts of assistance. The objects of the campaign were: in general to obtain a sequence of prehistoric pottery for Chalcidice, which would determine its cultural relations to the rest of Macedonia; and in particular to try to ' place ' a certain kind of painted pottery (black on red) known only from chance finds on various mounds. (I) The mound at Molyv6pyrgo revealed two periods of occupation, of which the lower stratum contained exclusively Early Aegean Bronze Age pottery of the Helladic variety, including the characteristic bowls with incurved rims and several examples of a primitive' sauce-boat '; the fabric is indistinguishable from the 'non-Urfirniss' variety of Early Helladic ware. The upper stratum yielded pottery which was mostly coarser, monochrome ware, shewing close affinities with that of central Macedonia, but associated with it were numerous fragments of Minyan ring-stemmed goblets, of the true Minyan variety, though of rather coarser fabric than that known from Central and Southern Greece. Interesting remains of habitations came to light at this level, in the form of a thick wall of loosely-heaped stones running along the E.-W. axis of the mound, with cross-walls at intervals dividing the area into six or more sectors; in four of these, remains of cobble-floors were preserved, and in one of these rooms it was possible to distinguish three stages of occupation denoted by renewal of the paving. (2) Systematic tests in the form of shafts at regular vertical intervals and trenches dug along the sides of the mound at H. Mamas down to virgin soil revealed the following stratification: (a) A Neolithic stratum, about one metre thick, yielding sherds closely resembling 'Thessalian' wares (white on black-polished, rippled, beaded and burnished), and a few painted ones resembling some classes of 'Thessalian A and B.' (b) A stratum about 7 metres thick containing Early Helladic ware, as at Molyv6pyrgo, and apparently corresponding chronologically to the latter half of ' Period A ' at Vardar6ftsa. In it were found a potter's kiln, several complete vases, fragments of anthropomorphic vases, a stone axe, a necklace of teeth and carved bone beads, and figurines of Trojan type. (c) This stratum corresponded to 'Period B ' at Vardar6ftsa, and yielded a few fragments of incised ware, a fair amount of Minyan, as at Molyv6pyrgo, and much coarse indeterminate ware. (d) A stratum whose finds agreed closely with those of 'Period C' at Vardar6ftsa, with the wish-bone-handle wares becoming common, and in the upper levels large quantities of Mycenaean sherds (L. H, III. b). At the end of this period the site was abandoned. X2</page><page sequence="10">308 BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS. [1927-1928 Important conclusions can probably be drawn when this mass of ceramic evidence has been fully studied, as to the relations of the cultures of Central Macedonia and Chalcidice. It seems already plain that in the second Bronze Age Period (Middle Helladic) these areas had a uniform culture in general, though the former was more exposed to Danubian influences, and the latter to those derived from the south, owing to proximity to old maritime trade-routes, whereby they received, and imitated, the Minyan goblets then prevalent in the Aegean areas. In the Late Helladic Period the culture of these two areas seems to have become identical. The particular problem as to the painted neolithic ware was not, however, solved, but in the light of the neolithic deposit found by Professor Robinson at Olynthus, which proves different from that found by Mr. Heurtley, it is hoped that the excavation of another neolithic site next season will clear up the problem of these two apparently distinct neolithic cultures. Knossos.-This year Sir Arthur Evans continued on an extensive scale the task of reconstitution and reconstruction in the quarters east of the Central Court, the work being supervised by Mr. Piet De Jong, the architect of the School. With the aid of reinforced concrete the whole of the Hall of the Double Axes, including its eastern and southern porticoes, has been roofed over, and the remains of the upper floor relaid at its original height. The Gypsum pavement and other perishable features of what is the largest Palace hall have been saved from further depredation and the painted stucco remains in the hall above have also been secured and protected. The lobby of the Grand Staircase has also been entirely restored and roofed over, a replica of the great ' Shield Fresco' that belonged to its inner face being executed to fill its inner face by Monsieur E. Gillidron. His skilful hand has also restored the 'Fish Fresco' on the north wall of the Queen's Megaron and the Spiral Frieze of the Bath-Room. The reconstitution of the area bordering the Grand Staircase has at the same time been continued to a level somewhat above that of the Central Court. One great advantage of this method of cement restora- tion-partly by means of imitation blocks-is that the new work can at once be recognised by the trained eye. Five months' work, with the employment of over fifty masons and carpenters, was devoted to this undertaking, from early in March to the beginning of August. No extensive excavation took place, but mention must be made of the discovery near the House of the Frescoes of a Minoan well lined with over thirty cylinders of terracotta, so hard as to be at first mistaken for stone, incised with signs, some of them taken from the linear script. A very careful exploration of the area north of the Central Court has led to stratigraphic results of great interest. A complete scheme of the original upper system of the North Pillar Hall and Entrance Passage has been elaborated from the existing elements. Two great friezes of painted reliefs representing bull-grappling and bull-catching scenes, answering respectively to those of the Vapheio Cups, seem to have adorned the back-walls of Porticoes, running above the Bastions on either side.</page><page sequence="11">ANNUAL MEETING OF SUBSCRIBERS. 309 The Library.-This session has been a notably successful one for the Library, in the matter of accessions, mostly due to generous donations; and certain welcome contributions of money have enabled more works to be pur- chased than the annual grant normally permits. As, moreover, additional shelving has been erected, space has been secured for expansion in some im- portant sections (Byzantine History, Greek Literature, Religion and Travel). The total number of volumes in the Library, including pamphlets and periodicals, has now passed 8,ooo. The accessions for 1927-28 numbered 281, of which 39 were pamphlets and 58 bound volumes of periodicals. The principal purchases include Langlotz, Friihgriechische Bildhauerschulen, Albizzati, Vasi Dipinti del Vaticano (as far as issued), Ed. Meyer, Geschichte des Altertums, vol. ii. I (new edn.), and new portions of Antike Denkmdler, Inscriptiones Graecae (Ed. Minor), Jacoby's Fragmente der Griechischen Historiker, and the German publication of the Miletus excavations. Among gifts, mention must be made first of the Chairman's munificent present of 83 volumes dealing with Byzantine History from the library of the late Professor J. B. Bury, including texts in the Bonn series of Byzantine historians, costly monographs by Chalandon, Diehl, Schlumberger and others, and important pamphlets in various languages. A special book-plate has been inserted in each of these works. The Library is also much indebted to the generosity of Mr. Charles Eddy, Chairman of the Refugee Settlement Commis- sion, for the gift of the American publication of the Excavations at Sardis, already extending to several volumes, as well as of Excavations at Ur, Pt. I, and D6rpfeld's A lt-Ithaka. Dr. Wm. Miller, another devoted benefactor of the School, has presented the new edition by Karolides of Paparrigopoulos's 'Ia-opL' rou 'E- LvXxoi5 "Evouq, in addition to five volumes of his own historical works, including Essays on the Latin Orient, The Ottoman Empire (new edn.) and Greece. From the late Dr. D. G. Hogarth were received shortly before his death six important works published by the Oxford Press, namely, Hunter and Handford, Aeneas on Siegecraft, Kondakov, The Russian Ikon (English translation), Lobel, 'AXxLou MihX, Newell, The Coinage of Demetrios Poliorcetes, Pickard-Cambridge, Dithyramb, Tragedy, Comedy, and Rostovtzeff, The Ancient World. As a result of publishing in the Annual a special list of Desiderata, the following works were received from various members of the Committee of the School, whose names follow: De Ridder, Bronzes Antiques du Louvre (Miss W. Lamb), Catalogue of the Conservatori Museum, by the British School at Rome (Mr. D. S. Robertson), Anderson-Spiers, Architecture of Greece and Rome, the new revised edition in two vols. (Mr. M. S. Thompson). Other donors to whom cordial thanks are due are Miss C. A. Hutton and Dr. J. G. Milne, two unfailing supporters, and Messrs. H. G. G. Payne, C. A. Ralegh Radford, G. A. D. Tait, Miss G. E. Todd, and Professor W. D. Woodhead; and for</page><page sequence="12">310 BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS. [1927-1928 miscellaneous gifts of maps and pamphlets, Mr. S. C. Atchley, Professor V. Gordon Childe, and the Skias family. The following authors have given copies of their own works, of which only a selection can be enumerated: Sir Arthur Evans, The Palace of Minos, Vol. II., E. H. Freshfield, Revised Manual of Roman Law, A. W. Lawrence, Later Greek Sculpture, Professor J. L. Myres, Political Ideas of the Greeks, Sir Rennell Rodd, Homer's Ithaca, Professor P. N. Ure, Sixth- and Fifth-Century Pottery from Rhitsona, A. J. B. Wace, A Cretan Statuette. Pamphlets in English have been received from Messrs. A. R. Bellinger, H. Frankfort, J. P. Harland, H. G. G. Payne, Alan Rowe and Professor H. J. W. Tillyard; and in other European tongues from Messrs. Hammarstrom, E. Kjellberg, J. Sundwall, N. Svensson, Professor U. Wilcken, and Dr. N. Zupanic of Laibach. For publica- tions in Greek the Library is indebted to Messrs. P. Axioutides, Ph. Koukoule, M. G. Michaelides and Professor A. D. Keramopoullos. The following institutions have kindly sent gifts of books, pamphlets or reports :-The Trustees of the British Museum; the Cambridge University Press; the Governments of Egypt, India and Malta; the French Ministry of Instruction and Fine Arts; the American School at Athens; the Universities of Michigan and Toronto; the University of Uppsala; the Academie des Sciences d'Ukraine; the Greek Archaeological Service; the CEnoyoq '"2eVi(.OV BL~?M)Av, and Messrs. John Tiranti and Co. On the occasion of the celebration of the centenary of the death of Captain Hastings, a small exhibition of relics was held under the auspices of the Greek Historical and Ethnological Society. Among the most important exhibits were certain books and documents from the Hastings archives in the Finlay Library, selected by the Director with the kind assistance of Dr. Wm. Miller. These were duly returned, with a cordial expression of thanks by Professor Rados, President of the above-named Society. The School Property and Premises.-The Committee are glad to announce the recent completion of the sale to the Trustees of the American School of the vacant plot of land situated north of Speusippos St. The purchasers propose to erect a Hostel for their studcnts on the site, which when completed will add to the architectural amenities of the neighbourhood, and ensure the exclu- sion of uncongenial buildings. The final negotiations in Athens between the Director and Professor Edward Capps, Chairman of the Managing Committee of the American School, were complicated by an unexpected claimant to owner- ship of part of the site; but, thanks to the unremitting assistance of Mr. Aristides Kyriakides, who was acting as legal adviser to both Schools in the matter of the sale, a satisfactory arrangement was arrived at, and the final deed of transfer was signed in August. As the Director had left Athens by that date, after signing a preliminary agreement, Mr. Atchley of the British Legation, kindly undertook to act on his behalf. This sale will not only bring a welcome addition to the School's financial resources, but will relieve the Committee of a</page><page sequence="13">ANNUAL MEETING OF SUBSCRIBERS. 311 piece of land which they were unlikely ever to require for building purposes, and the retention of which had been more than once, and might again have been, a source of trouble and expense. The School buildings have again required attention, as it was found that the roofs of both the Director's house and the Hostel were not impervious to heavy rain. The necessary work was completed in the spring of 1928, the defective tiles of the latter being replaced, and the terrace-flagstones on both buildings being re-pointed and coated with a waterproof mixture, with com- pletely satisfactory results. Repairs and renewals of minor importance only have been put in hand this summer, but the outside painting of the Director's house will require to be re-done in 1929. The garden and its requirements have also needed much attention. The veteran gardener installed by Mr. Wace was dismissed with a gratuity at the end of 1927, as he had got too old even for light work; an interim successor brought by the Director from Sparta (where he had proved a particularly diligent and trustworthy worker) did useful work for a few months, but owing to a breakdown in health had to return home; and a more suitable gardener, who lives close at hand, has now been taken on, and promises to be very satisfactory The high cost of water continues to be a real hardship, and those who remember the garden will learn with regret that the three fine plane trees close to the Director's house have now all died and had to be cut down. A zinc tank has, however, been installed to catch the used bath-water at the Hostel, which enables a few beds close to it to be kept alive at least till the end of the session. At Knossos Sir Arthur Evans has entirely renovated the old Taverna lying below the Villa Ariadne so as to be a convenient additional residence for students. New concrete floors have been put in above and a single and double bedroom and sitting room have been fully furnished. A verandah opening from these has been constructed looking on to pine-wood; and offices made beyond. Below a kitchen and work room have been arranged with a space that could be used as a commodious garage and an enclosed yard has been made outside. Outside the Villa an outhouse made for an oven has been added to, re- arranged and re-roofed so as to form a separate room for an overseer or any other additional member of the staff. Certain necessary repairs to the Villa Ariadne, which should not prove expensive, will be put in hand early next session. It is satisfactory to be able to report that a new arrangement on favourable terms for the School has been made in respect of the leasing of the valuable vineyards forming part of the estate. Acknowledgments.-It is pleasant-and indeed superfluous-to repeat that the School individually and collectively continues to receive every courtesy</page><page sequence="14">312 BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS. [1927-1928 and all possible help from Dr. Kourouniotes and the other members of the Greek Archaeological Service. The Director wishes especially to thank Pro- fessor G. P. Oikonomos and his Assistant, Dr. K. Konstantopoulos, for granting him every facility for work in the Numismatic Museum, and for frequent help in the matter of cleaning and identifying the coins from Sparta. For services in connection with excavations and work in local museums, special acknowledg- ment is gratefully made to Drs. Karachalios, Pelekides and the late Dr. Xanthoudides, at Sparta, Salonika and Candia respectively. With our colleagues of the other Foreign Schools the most cordial relations continue. The British Minister, Sir Percy Loraine, and the personnel of the Legation have again earned the gratitude of the School for services of many kinds, and the Committee wish to tender their gratitude to Mr. Atchley for acting on the Director's behalf in the final formalities connected with the sale of the plot of land to the American School, as described above. In offering their acknowledgments to the officials of the Consular service, they learn with regret that Mr. R. W. Bullard, a good friend and frequent visitor to the School, is leaving Athens; and they thank with particular warmth the Consul-General and Vice-Consul at Salonika for kind and prompt action, and much trouble taken on the occasion of Mr. McMullen's serious illness whilst working there. The staff of the American Farm School near Salonika, for kindly allowing him to recuperate at the School, is also deserving of grateful recognition. Mr. G. L. Bailey and his staff at the Headquarters of the Lake Copais Company have again hospitably entertained members of the School visiting his neighbourhood. Thanks are tendered on Mr. Heurtley's behalf to Mr. and Mrs. Pierson of the Anglo-Greek Magnesite Company at Gerakini in Chalcidice, and to Professor D6rpfeld for hospitality at Leukas. And, among various friends of the School who have enjoyed the use of the tennis-court, thanks are due to Mr. R. Turner of the British Legation for several generous gifts of tennis-balls. Obituary.-The School has to deplore the death during the last twelve months of Dr. D. G. Hogarth, Miss Jane Harrison, Mr. Pandelli Ralli and Sir James Agg-Gardner. The death of Dr. David Hogarth at the beginning of last session cast a gloom over the School, and deprived it of one who had been closely concerned with it from its very commencement. He was the second person to be admitted as a student (in 1886), and returned as Director in 1897 for three sessions. For many years before his death he had been a member of the Managing Com- mittee. His services to Oxford, particularly as Keeper of the Ashmolean, to the Royal Geographical Society as President, and above all to his country in the War, have been commemorated in various memoirs recently published. But it is fitting in this Report to record gratefully the services he rendered to the School. Not only as an efficient Director and active excavator, but by his invariably wise counsel and warm-hearted encouragement of good work alike as a member of the Committee and informally, and by his unfailing generosity</page><page sequence="15">ANNUAL MEETING OF SUBSCRIBERS. 313 in gifts of books to the Library, he shewed himself a true friend and benefactor, whose name will long be held in grateful remembrance. The School has lost another good friend-for many years an active member of the Committee-in Miss Jane Harrison, who died during the summer. Though of late years her interests had led her away from classical archaeology, students for many years past have been much indebted to her for her Mythology and Monuments of Ancient Athens, Introductory Studies in Greek Art, Prolegomena to Greek Religion and other stimulating works, and as a link between Cambridge and the School she played an active and many-sided part. Not the least of her interests was the work of women-students at the School. Sir James Agg-Gardner and Mr. Pandelli Ralli served on the Committee in the early days of the School and were two of its original Trustees. The Committee take this opportunity of putting on record their deep regret on hearing news of the deaths of Professor P. Kavvadias, in July 1928, and of Dr. S. Xanthoudides, who died suddenly at Candia in September. The former, long the doyen of Greek archaeologists, had been in constant touch with, and a firm friend of, the British School ever since its foundation; the latter, also an archaeologist and scholar of great gifts and versatility, had invariably extended to all workers in Crete ' an obliging readiness to help and a friendly appreciation ' (to quote from the memoir by Sir Arthur Evans published in The Times of September 21st). Finance.-The Revenue Account for the year shews a debit balance of 149 Ios. 7d. as compared with a similar balance of l451 4s. 2d. for the preceding year. Annual Subscriptions have increased from l863 to l900 which is a satisfactory feature, but expenses of maintenance of both House and Hostel are considerably higher, partly owing to necessary increases in wages and partly to the greater number of Students in residence. The year's expenses also include the cost of two Studentships one of which is properly applicable to the preceding year. The money received for sale of land, l2,500, is at present on Deposit but will shortly be invested. Although the results shew some little improvement and some new permanent income will now be forthcoming from the proceeds of the land sold, the Revenue Account for the last two years shews a total deficit of over l600, and further financial support is essential if the work of the School is to be carried on with efficiency. The Committee feel that the Report presents an unusually satisfactory account of the activities of the School, but are bound to add a note of warning as to its financial position. To enable it to carry on its work with full efficiency a large addition to the number of annual subscribers is urgently needed, and substantial contributions to an Endowment Fund would also be a great help to the Treasurer. Its claims to the support of all who are interested in the</page><page sequence="16">314 BRITISH SCHOOL AT ATHENS. [1927-1928 progress of Classical Archaeology cannot be questioned, and the Committee appeal to all friends of the School to do their utmost to enlist further support, whether in the form of annual subscriptions or donations. The following motion, proposed by MR. A. J. B. WACE and seconded by LADY EVANS, was carried unanimously:- 'That PROFESSORS J. L. MYRES, J. P. DROOP, A. J. TOYNBEE and MR. L. WHIBLEY be re-elected members of the Committee, that DR. W. R. HALLIDAY and MR. E. J. FORSDYKE be elected members of the Committee, and that MR. V. W. YORKE be re-elected Hon. Treasurer.' The Chairman, LORD CRAWFORD, then moved the adoption of the Annual Report, which was seconded by PROFESSOR W. R. LETHABY and carried unanimously. SIR ARTHUR EVANS then spoke on some recent discoveries at the British Museum concerning two reliefs among the Elgin Marbles and their probable relation to sculptures of the Northern Entrance at Knossos. He also described recent reconstruction-work at Knossos. The Director, MR. A. M. WOODWARD, gave a retrospective account of the School's excavations at Sparta, 1924-1927. After a vote of thanks to the Chairman, the proceedings came to an end.</page></plain_text>
